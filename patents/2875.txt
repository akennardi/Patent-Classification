                                       ABSTRACT
A slide-out system having a first and second slide-out assembly which are fixed to a first
and second side of a slide-out room respectfully. Each assembly preferably includes an
upper and lower gear rack fixed to the respective side of the slide-out room. An electric
motor is connected to a drive gear that engages the top gear rack, driving movement of
the slide-out room. This movement is distributed or synchronized with a lower portion of
the room by an axle having a top gear engaged with the top gear rack and a bottom gear
engaged with the bottom gear rack. Since the axle is not directly connected to the motor, it
acts solely as a secondary synchronization mechanism between the top and bottom of the
room.

                     SLIDE-OUT ROOM MECHANISM FOR A VEHICLE
                                   RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]     The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent
Application No. 2013211537, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
reference.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0001a] A reference herein to a matter identified as prior art, is not to be taken as an
admission that the matter was known or that the information it contains was part of the
common general knowledge as at the priority date of any of the claims.
[0001b] Where any or all of the terms "comprise", "comprises", "comprised" or
"comprising" are used in this specification (including the claims) they are to be interpreted
as specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps or components, but not
precluding the presence of one or more other features, integers, steps or components.
[0002]     The embodiments set forth in this specification relate to mechanisms for moving
a slide-out room into or out of a vehicle. An example slide-out mechanism and vehicles
can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 7,370,900, the contents of which are incorporated herein by
reference.
[0003]     In order to increase the available interior space of a motorized or towable
vehicle such as a motor home or trailer, these vehicles have been designed to include
slide-out rooms. When the vehicle is in transit, the slide-out room is retracted and stored
in the vehicle's interior with the exterior wall of the slide-out room approximately flush with
the vehicle's exterior. As a result, there is typically adequate space within the vehicle's
interior to accommodate users in transit and remain within the standard width limitations
imposed upon a vehicle. When the vehicle is parked and leveled, the slide-out room is
then slid outward through an opening formed in a sidewall of the vehicle thereby,
increasing the internal accommodations.
[0004]     Typically, slide-out rooms include a floor section, a roof section, a first sidewall
section, a second sidewall section, and a third sidewall section. In the retracted position,
                                                 1

the roof section and the first and second sidewall section are concealed from exterior
view, and the third sidewall section forms a portion of the vehicle's sidewall. At the same
time, the floor section of the slide-out room typically rests above a floor section of a fixed
room and may form a portion of the usable interior floor during vehicle transit. Similarly,
the roof section of the slide-out room may define the interior ceiling of that part of the
vehicle during transit. The proximal ends of the roof section, first sidewall section, and
second sidewall section, include stop walls. As used herein, "proximal" refers to the
portion towards the vehicle body and "distal" refers to the portion away from the vehicle
body. The stop walls form an L-shaped configuration with the respective roof section, first
sidewall section and second sidewall section. The stop walls engage the inner surface of
a respective sidewall section of the fixed room when the slide-out room is fully extended,
and thereby limit the travel of the slide-out room.
[0005]     Many slide-out room designs include a manual or motorized mechanism for
extending or retracting the slide-out room from a vehicle. For example, U.S. Patent
Application 2004/0007890 entitled Room Expansion System, filed June 25, 2003, and
U.S. Pat. No. 5,833,296 entitled Motor-Operated Slide-Out Drive System With Releasable
Brake, issued Nov. 10, 1998, each of which are hereby incorporated by reference. As
seen in these example patents, the slide-out mechanism often includes a gear rack fixed
beneath the slide-out room floor with at least one gear mounted to the vehicle and
engaged with the gear rack. Thus, the gear rack and slide-out room are moved as the
gear rotates either from a manual crank or a connected motor.
[0006]    A significant benefit to this type of drive gearing is its simplicity. Moreover,
heavy-duty gearing used in such a design typically increases the lifespan of the
mechanism. Yet, with this type of gearing design most of the motive force is concentrated
and exerted at the bottom of the room. This localized load on the bottom surface of the
room can often create uneven slide-out conditions between the slide-out room's bottom
portion (where the load is concentrated) and the top portion (where there is very little
load).
[0007]     Furthermore, due to the size of some slide-out rooms, the top of the slide-out
room may be caused to move relative to bottom if pushed, bumped, or otherwise moved
due to the "play" that exists in this type of gearing design. This "play" at the top of the
slide-out room can intermittently unseal the slide-out room from the vehicle body when
                                                2

the slide-out room is in the closed position. Thus, dirt, water or other undesirable
elements may enter the vehicle body thus making the vehicle interior unsightly or even
causing damage.
[0008]     At times, however, uneven extension or retraction of a slide-out room has been
designed into the slide-out mechanism. For example, some prior art flush floor slide-out
room designs extend and retract the slide-out room at varying angles to easily and
efficiently extend to a flush position with the floor of the main vehicle body. However, it is
preferable that the slide-out room retract to a substantially level position.
                               SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0009]     This specification describes a slide-out system having a first and second slide
out assembly fixed to a first and second side of a slide-out room respectfully. Each
assembly preferably includes an upper and lower gear rack fixed to the respective side of
the slide-out room. An electric motor is connected to a drive gear that engages the top
gear rack, driving movement of the slide-out room. This movement is distributed or
synchronized with a lower portion of the room by an axle having a top gear engaged with
the top gear rack and a bottom gear engaged with the bottom gear rack. Since the axle is
not directly connected to the motor, it acts solely as a secondary synchronization
mechanism between the top and bottom of the room.
[0010]     An embodiment which is described in this specification allows a user to easily
replace a motor of a slide-out system from the interior or exterior of the slide-out room
and without the need to remove the entire slide-out room and slide-out system from the
vehicle. More specifically, side channels of the system include inner and outer flexible flap
seals than can be pulled back by a user to expose the motor. The motor is mounted to a
support structure and drive gear in a way that either lacks any vertical retaining
mechanism or includes a mechanism that is easily disengaged. Hence a user can
vertically move the motor upwards (e.g., by prying with a screw driver). For example, the
motor may include a plurality of vertical mounting posts that engage a plurality of
matching apertures in the mounting bracket.
[0011]     This specification further describes that a slide-out mechanism can be attached
to the slide-out room when both are located outside of the vehicle (Le., the slide-out room
                                               3

is detached from the vehicle). Once attached, the room and system can be placed in an
aperture of a vehicle such that the system's side channels engage a portion of the
vehicle's walls. Finally, a flange member can be added to and engaged with the channel
so as to clamp onto an inner surface of the vehicle's wall in one configuration or to clamp
onto an outer surface of the vehicle's wall in another configuration. Hence, the slide-out
system by be more easily installed as a "single" unit on each side of the room, instead of
installing portions of the system separately on the vehicle and slide-out room before lifting
the slide-out room into the vehicle's aperture.
[0011a]          In accordance with the present invention there is provided a slide-out
system for a vehicle, comprising:
a drive mechanism attachable to a slide-out room;
a vertical channel supporting at least part of said drive mechanism; said vertical channel
comprising a first flange spaced apart from a first mounting location;
a clamp member selectively engagable with said first mounting location, so as to orient
said clamp member in a position substantially parallel with said first flange.

                             DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0030]     Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to
the accompanying drawings. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different
forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather,
these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete,
and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. The terminology
used in the detailed description of the embodiments illustrated in the accompanying
drawings is not intended to be limiting of the invention. In the drawings, like numbers refer
to like elements.
[0031]     Figures 1-6 illustrate an embodiment of a slide-out mechanism 100 that moves
a room into and out of an aperture of a vehicle (e.g., a recreation vehicle). As described in
detail below, the mechanism 100 has a motorized assembly, shown in Figure 1, which
advances or retracts a slide-out room from a vehicle while a separate equalizing
assembly 123 distributes force from a lower portion of the slide-out room 101 to an upper
portion of the slide-out room 101. While a motorized system is described below, it should
be understood that a manually-actuated version is also possible.
[0032]     As seen best in Figure 1, the mechanism 100 includes a motor 104 coupled a
gear 106 of cross shaft 102 which thereby allows the motor to rotate the cross shaft 102.
Each end of the cross shaft 102 also include a gear 110 that engage with a rack 108 that
is fixed to the bottom of the slide-out room 101 (not shown in this figure). As the gears
110 rotate, they move the racks 108 (including channels 116A and track 118) into and out
of the vehicle, thereby also moving the slide-out room 101 into and out of the vehicle.
[0033]     Figure 4 illustrates the equalizing or synchronizing assembly 123 which
transfers some of the force/movement delivered to the lower portion of the slide-out room
101 to the upper portion of the room 101. Each side of the slide-out room includes an
upper and lower gear rack 114, including a geared track 118. The track 118 of each rack
114 are engaged with upper and lower gears 122, each of which are respectively fixed to
upper and lower portions of a vertical axle 124. The vertical axle 124 is rotatably fixed to
                                              6

an upper and lower bearing block 120, allowing both the axle 124 and gears 122 to
rotate. This arrangement also allows the synchronizing components to support the room
from tipping as it is extended or retracted.
[0034]     The bearing blocks 120 are fixed to side channels 112 of the vehicle (shown in
Figure 1) but also have lips or ridges that engage channels 11 6A of the outer molding
116 of the rack 114 (best seen in Figures 2 and 3). In this respect, the bearing blocks 120
are fixed to the vehicle, but also generally maintain a close distance to the gear rack 114.
[0035]     In operation, the motor 104 drives the cross shaft 102, causing the gears 110 to
push the racks 108 (including track 118 and channels 11 6A) and therefore the bottom of
the slide-out room 101. The synchronizing assembly 123 transfers some of the
movement/force of the slide-out room 101 to an upper portion of the room 101 by causing
the vertical axle 124, which is engaged with both the lower and upper gear racks 114, to
rotate.
[0036]     It should also be understood that the lower gear rack 114 could be located on
the bottom surface of the slide-out room 101, as shown in several embodiments of U.S.
Pat. No. 7,370,900, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Figure 13
of the present specification illustrates one such mechanism from the '900 patent
(originally Figure 26) which translates the movement of a bottom, horizontal gear rack to
a top gear rack. In this arrangement, gears engage the lower, horizontal rack while two
bearings (unlabeled) engage a groove of the rack to help maintain the gears in
engagement with the rack.
[0037]     Figures 5 and 6 illustrates another embodiment of a slide-out room mechanism
130 having at least four gear racks located at various locations on the slide-out room 101.
For example, in the figures, the gear racks 132 are located on the left and right sides of
the top and bottom of the slide-out room 101. However, the gear racks 132 may
alternately be located on the upper and lower areas of the left and right sides of the slide
out room 101, similar to those shown in the previous embodiment.
[0038]     Each rack 132 is engaged with its own gear 136, each of which is driven by its
own motor 134 (seen in best in the top view of Figure 6). Each motor is controlled by a
microcontroller or computer processor (not shown) which controls each of the motors 134
                                              7

and maintains uniform or synchronous movement. The motors 132 may also be
controlled to asynchronously rotate at specific points during the extension or retraction of
the slide-out room 101 to, for example, cause the room 101 to be angled upwards or
downwards for various design or alignment purposes.
[0039]    Preferably, the motors 134 and gears 136 are mounted to the vehicle at a fixed
position. Alternately, the motors 134 and gears 136 may be mounted to allow vertical
movement. In this regard, vertical leveling systems may also be included in the slide-out
mechanism 130 to increase or decrease the vertical height of the room 101 without
dislodging the gear 136 from the rack 132. Additionally, the rack 132 and gear 136 may
include a groove and lip arrangement similar to the previous embodiment for maintaining
a constant distance between the rack 132 and the gear 136.
[0040]    Figures 7-12 illustrate another embodiment of a slide-out mechanism 150
according to the present invention which is generally similar to the previously described
mechanism 100. However, the slide-out mechanism 150 has two motors 104 mounted
near a top side of each side channel 112 and engaging with the top gear rack 116.
[0041]    As with the previous mechanism 100, the mechanism 150 includes a vertical
axle 124 having a synchronizing gear 156 on its top and bottom end (see Figure 11). The
top synchronizing gear 156 engages the top gear rack 116 attached to the slide-out room
101 while the bottom synchronizing gear 160 engages the bottom gear rack 116. Hence,
as the top synchronizing gear 156 rotates, the vertical axle 124 synchronously rotates the
bottom synchronizing gear 160, thereby evenly distributing force between the top and
bottom of the slide-out room 101.
[0042]    As seen best in Figures 10 and 11, the drive gear 154 of the motor 104, and the
top synchronizer gear 156 share and engage the same gear track 118 of the top gear
rack 116. Hence, the gear track 118 of the top gear rack 116 may be somewhat wider
than the gear track 119 of the bottom gear rack 116. However, the drive gear 154 does
not directly drive rotation of the top synchronizer gear 156 and no direct, rotating,
mechanical drive linkage is provided between the two gears. In this respect, the
synchronizer gears 156/16@ and axle 124 do not directly receive force from the motor
104 or drive gear 154.
                                             8

[0043]      The gears 154, 156 and 160 are enclosed in one of two bearing blocks 152
which are fixed in place by two mechanisms. The first mechanism includes two raised lips
or hooks 152A on the bearing blocks 152 that interlock with two grooves 116A of the gear
racks 116. As seen best in Figures 9, 10 and 11, these grooves 116A are arranged on
either side of the gear track 118 or 119 and helps maintain the bearing block 152 and its
gears against the gear rack 116. Preferably, these grooves are shaped or angled such
that water (e.g., rain) flows over their openings. For example, the upper groove has a
generally inclined and vertical cross sectional shape and the lower groove has a generally
vertical cross sectional shape. In this respect, the shape of the grooves 116A help
prevent water from otherwise entering the vehicle.
[0044]      With regard to the second mechanism, the bearing blocks 152 are directly fixed
to the vertical channel 112 of the vehicle by tabs 112A on the channel 112 that engage
with grooves 152B on the bearing blocks 152, as best seen in the cross sectional view of
Figure 12. The bearing blocks 152 and the channel 112 are further connected via
adhesive or additional mechanical fastener (e.g., bolts). In this respect, the bearing blocks
152 are fixed to both the gear racks 116 of the slide-out room 101 and the channel 112 of
the vehicle.
[0045]      As best seen in Figure 11, the lower gear rack 116B may include a
perpendicular lower surface 11 6B. This surface 11 6B can be located along the underside
of the slide-out room floor and allows the gear rack 116 to be evenly mounted.
[0046]       Preferably, each of the embodiments of this specification include rollers that are
mounded beneath the slide-out room (i.e., mounted either to the vehicle or to the bottom
of the slide-out room. These rollers are oriented to support the weight of the room and
facilitate its movement into and out of the vehicle.
[0047]       Figures 13-17, illustrate a clamp mechanism or removable inner flange for
facilitating installation of the slide-out mechanism to a vehicle wall 103. As seen in Figure
13, the cross sectionally "T" shaped side channels 112 include an outwardly flanged ridge
112C that is located against an outer surface of a vehicle wall 103, adjacent to the wall's
aperture for the slide-out room 101. Depending on the size of the slide-out room 101 and
its attached slide-out mechanism, the perpendicular portion 112D of the side channels
112 may be spaced apart from or flush against the edge of the wall 103. Next, an angled
                                                9

end 170A of a non-unitary flange or clamp member 170 is positioned into a mating groove
112B in the channel 112, as seen in Figure 14. Generally, the mating groove 112B and
angled end 170A are shaped such that they lock the clamp member 170 into a position
that is generally parallel with flanged ridge 112C, thereby clamping the channel 112 on to
the wall 103. In one embodiment, the groove 112B includes a sloping curve and an
overhanging portion, while the angled end 170A includes an oppositely oriented curve
shape to engage the overhanging portion. The clamp member 170 may be further
screwed to the wall 103 via a plurality of screws. Preferably, the clamp member 170
extends substantially the length of the channel 112 or alternately a plurality of clamp
members 170 with smaller lengths can be used. Alternately, the clamp member 170 may
be connected to then channel 112 via a hinge mechanism that allows the member 170 to
swing outwards, away from the wall 103.
[0048]     Turning to Figures 16 and 17, an outer seal flap 173 and an inner seal flap 172
can be attached to the channel 112 to help prevent weather elements, such as rain, from
entering the vehicle. Preferably, both seal flaps 172A and 174A include hollow bumper
portions 172A and 174A. In the case of the bumper 174A, this region contacts an inner
surface of the slide-out room 101, preventing damage to the vehicle and further
enhancing the seal of the flap 174 when the room 101 is in a retracted position.
[0049]     In one embodiment, the slide-out system includes several features to easily
replace the motor 104. Since the inner seal flap 172 is preferably composed of flexible
material, such as rubber or silicone, it can be bent backwards by a user when inside the
slide-out room 101 to expose the motor 104.
[0050]     Additionally, a modified bearing block 176 can further facilitate easy removal
and replacement of the motor 104. As seen in Figures 18 and 19, the bearing block 176
is similar to the previously described bearing blocks, including inner lips or hooks 176A
that engage channels 116A and an additional outer lip 176B that bears against an outer
surface of the gear rack 116. The top surface of the bearing block 176 includes a plurality
of apertures 176D that are sized to accept matching posts 104A located on a lower
surface of the motor 104. Hence, the motor 104 can be detached from the bearing block
176 via upward, vertical movement, without the need to remove any vertical restraint
mechanism on the motor 104.
                                              10

[0051]     To further facilitate moving the motor 104 upward, one or more inset regions or
depressions 176C (e.g., between .1 and 1 inch deep) are located on the top surface of
the bearing block 176, allowing a user to insert a screw driver, or similar tool, between the
depression 176C and the motor 104 to upwardly pry the motor 104. Preferably, the
bearing block 176 includes two depressions along the inner side of the bearing block 176
such that one depression is accessible from an inside of the slide-out room 101 and
another depression is accessible from an outside of the vehicle (i.e., by pulling back seal
flap 174). To allow easy insertion of a screw driver, the depressions 176C are preferably
located along an outer edge of the bearing block 176.
[0052]     As further seen in Figures 20 and 21, the drive gear 154 preferably includes a
stepped-down or recessed "D" fitting, sized to mate with the axle 105 and flat surface
105A. In other words, the drive gear 154 includes an inset arc shape 154A within its
central passage. Hence, when the axle 105 of the motor 104 is placed on the drive gear
154, the axle 105 can partially enter the central passage of the gear 154, even if the flat
surface 105A and the arc shape 154A are not aligned with each other. The axle 105 can
then be rotated to align these surfaces, allowing the axle to pass fully into the drive gear
154.
[0053]     In this respect, a motor 104 can be removed from an inside of the slide-out
room by pulling back inner flap 172 to at least partially expose the motor 104, insert a tool
into a depression 176C on a support or bearing block 176 and exert upwards force on the
motor 104 such that the posts 104A move out of the apertures 176D of the block 176 and
the axle 105 moves out of the central passage of the drive gear 154. The motor 104 can
be removed from an outside of the slide-out room by pulling back outer flap 174 to at
least partially expose the motor 104, insert a tool into a depression 176C on a support or
bearing block 176 and exert upwards force on the motor 104 such that the posts 104A
move out of the apertures 1 76D of the block 176 and the axle 105 moves out of the
central passage of the drive gear 154. From either removal position, a new motor 104 can
be moved within the channel 112 and its posts 104A can be aligned with apertures 176D
and partially enter the central passage of the drive gear 154. Finally, the axle 105 can be
rotated to align the surfaces 105A and 154A to a mating position (i.e., such that the flat
portions of each component fit against each other), thereby allowing the axle 105 and
posts to fully enter the gear 154A and apertures 176D, respectfully.

[0054]     Preferably, the bearing block 176 is composed of a low friction material, such as
Delrin. In another embodiment, the bearing block 176 includes a low friction coating, such
as white lithium bearing grease spray, which is located on its inner surfaces to reduce
friction between it and the gears 154, 156, and axle 124.
[0055]     As best seen in Figures 22 and 23, the channels 116A of the gear rack 116
have upper surfaces that at least partially cover and/or are angled downwards when
mounted. This configuration helps reduce the amount of water that can accumulate when
extended in various weather conditions. Additionally, the bearing block 176 includes an
upper lip 176B which has a generally low clearance with the angled surface of the rack
116, thereby pushing off at least some of the water that may have accumulated while the
room 101 was extended. Similarly, the fingers or lips 176A are shaped to substantially
conform to the interior space of the cross sectional shape of the channels 11 6A with little
clearance, thereby allowing the lips 176A to push some of the water out of the channels
116A.
[0056]     In a preferred embodiment, the electrical wiring for the motor 104 is fixed within
the channel 112 prior to attachment of the slide-out system to the room 101. It is often
desirable to connect the motor to a vehicle's power supply near the bottom of the channel
112 and therefore positioning the electrical wires within the channel prior to installation of
the system avoids the need of fishing the wires through the channel after installation on
the room.
[0057]     Figures 22 and 23 illustrates cross sectional views of gear racks that are
generally similar to the previously described gear racks of this specification. However, the
present gear racks 116 includes a gear track mounting channel 116C with a relatively
rectangular/square shape and generally smooth/uniform surfaces as compared to the
rack 116 shown in Figure 10, which includes raised lip surfaces on the lower and side
portions. While these raised lip surfaces help maintain the track 119 in the gear rack 116
during normal use, they can make removal and replacement of the track 119 from the
rack 116 difficult, especially when mounted on a slide-out room 101. In contrast, the
smooth, rectangular surfaces of the track mounting channel 116C allows a user to insert
a screw driver 117 (or similar tool) between the gear rack 116 and the track 119 and pry
the track 119, breaking the adhesive bonds between the bottom and sides of the
mounting channel 116C and the track 119. Without the additional support provided by the
                                             12

raised lips of the Figure 10 rack 116, the prying movement more effectively breaks out
and therefore removes the track 119, as seen in Figure 24, allowing a user to remove the
track 119 while the rack 116 is still mounted to the room 101.
[0058]      In practice, a user can insert a screw driver 117 between a sidewall of track
mounting channel 116C and a side of track 119, and apply perpendicular force relative to
the two surfaces so as to cause separation of the surfaces and breaking an adhesive
bond. This motion is continued along the length of the track 119 and option along an
opposite side of the track 119 until the track 119 is free of the rack 116. Additionally, this
action can be performed while the rack 116 is still mounted on the slide-out room 101,
eliminating the need to remove the entire slide-out room 101 and slide-out system 150
from the vehicle.
[0059]      In one embodiment, the entire slide-out system 150 is configured for assembly
first to a slide-out room 101 that is located outside of a vehicle, and then later mounted to
walls of a vehicle. To better stabilize and generally maintain the top and bottom gear
racks 116 in a parallel orientation from each other, two temporary support members 178
are fixed to each end of the racks 116. Preferably, these support members are elongated
and of the same length such that they can be connected to each end of the racks 116
(e.g., generally the length between the gears 156 and 160).
[0060]      The slide-out system 150, including temporary support members 178 is located
against a first outer sidewall of a slide-out room 101. Once the gear racks 116 are
oriented in a desired position (e.g., parallel to the slide-out room's floor/ceiling), the gear
racks 116 are fixed to the slide-out room 101 (e.g., with screws). Next, the temporary
support members 178 are removed from the gear racks 116. The same process is
repeated with a second slide-out assembly on the opposite side of the slide-out room
101.
[0061]      Next, the slide-out room 101, including two assemblies of the slide-out system
150 are lifted into an aperture in the sidewall of a vehicle (see Figure 7). Preferably, the
slide-out room 101 includes a plurality of low profile rollers on its bottom surface, allowing
the room 101 to roll on an interior of the vehicle and maintain a desired height within the
aperture. The outer flanges 112C of the side channels 112 are moved against an outer
surface of the vehicle walls around the aperture. The channels 112 are clamped to the
                                               13

vehicle's wall by inserting clamp members 170 into the groove 112B of the channel 112,
thereby pressing the clamp member 170 against an inner surface of the vehicle wall 103.
Preferably, the outer flange 112C and clamp members 170 both include an elongated
channel 112E and 170B respectively for receiving adhesive tape or liquid adhesives for
adhering to the wall 103. Finally, the side channels 112 can be further secured to the
sidewall 103 via screws through either the flange 112C, the clamp 170 or both members.
[0062]     In an alternate channel embodiment, the locations of the fixed-position flange
112C and the clamp member 170 can be swapped or reversed, as seen in Figure 27. In
this respect, the slide-out system can be attached to the vehicle from the inside of the
vehicle, such that the flange 112C engages an inner surface of the wall 103 and then the
clamp member 170 is engaged with an outer surface of the wall 103.
[0063]     It should be understood that different elements and assemblies of the
embodiments described in this application can be replaced by those disclosed in U.S.
Pat. No. 7,370,900, which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, the gear
racks can be replaced by a geared belt, a chain, or other flexible horizontal member 190,
as seen in Figures 28 and 29 (originally from the '900 patent). In another example, the
axle 124 and gears 156 and 160 can be replaced by a vertical belt 194 and vertical gears
192. In another example, only the top or bottom gear racks may be replaced with belts or
chains, allowing both to be used.
[0064]     Although the invention has been described in terms of particular embodiments
and applications, one of ordinary skill in the art, in light of this teaching, can generate
additional embodiments and modifications without departing from the spirit of or
exceeding the scope of the claimed invention. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the
drawings and descriptions herein are proffered by way of example to facilitate
comprehension of the invention and should not be construed to limit the scope thereof.
