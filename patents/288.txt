        SUPPORT FOR A BREATHING ASSISTANCE APPARATUS AND/OR
                                      ACCESSORIES
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]         The present invention relates to a support apparatus for a breathing
assistance apparatus and/or for accessories of such an apparatus.
BACKGROUND ART
[0002]         Breathing assistance apparatuses are used in various environments
such as hospital, medical facility, residential care, or home environments to deliver
a flow of gas to users or patients.
[0003]         The breathing assistance apparatuses typically have one or more
accessories such as a breathing conduit and a patient interface such as a cannula
for delivering gases to a patient. The conduit is often a significant length to enable
gases to be delivered from the housing of the breathing assistance apparatus to the
patient who can be positioned a reasonable distance away from the apparatus. For
example, the apparatus may be placed on a floor or other support surface, and the
patient may be in a bed. Depending on the configuration of the breathing
assistance apparatus, the apparatus may have additional accessories such as a
flexible liquid bag that delivers liquid to a humidifier liquid chamber via one more
tubes.
[0004]         For home use, a breathing assistance apparatus may typically be kept
on the floor because the apparatus may be large and noisy. Additionally, the
apparatus is likely to be kept on the floor when the apparatus is not being used, so
it can be positioned out of the way. The floor environment can be dusty, increasing
the likelihood of dust and particulate ingress into the breathing assistance
apparatus and potentially into the gasflow. Because the apparatus may have gases
inlet(s) near the bottom of the apparatus, there may be a perception that the
apparatus should not be positioned on the floor. Generally, breathing assistance
apparatuses do not provide adequate storage for the patient interface such as a
cannula when it is not being used, meaning that the used patient interface such as
a cannula needs to be placed on a support surface such as a bedside table when it
is not being used. Additionally, the conduit can present a tripping hazard. Similar

                                             2
issues may be encountered in a transport situation; e.g. helicopter or ambulance
use.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS
1.      Introduction
[00101]       A flow therapy apparatus 10 for delivering a flow of gas to a patient is
shown in Figure 1. In general terms, the apparatus 10 comprises a main housing
100 that contains a flow generator 11 in the form of a motor/impeller arrangement,
an optional humidifier 12, a controller 13, and a user I/O interface 14 (comprising,
for example, a display and input device(s) such as button(s), a touch screen, or the
like). The controller 13 is configured or programmed to control the components of
the apparatus, including: operating the flow generator 11 to create a flow of gas
(gas flow) for delivery to a patient, operating the humidifier 12 (if present) to
humidify and/or heat the generated gas flow, receive user input from the user
interface 14 for reconfiguration and/or user-defined operation of the apparatus 10,
and output information (for example on the display) to the user. The user could be
a patient, healthcare professional, or anyone else interested in using the apparatus.
[00102]       A patient breathing conduit 16 is coupled to a gas flow output 344 in
the housing 100 of the flow therapy apparatus 10, and is coupled to a patient
interface 17 such as a nasal cannula with a manifold 19 and nasal prongs 18.
Additionally, or alternatively, the patient breathing conduit 16 could be coupled to a
face mask. Additionally or alternatively, the patient breathing conduit could be
coupled to a nasal pillows mask, and/or a nasal mask, and/or a tracheostomy
interface, or any other suitable type of patient interface. The gas flow, which may
be humidified, that is generated by the flow therapy apparatus 10 is delivered to
the patient via the patient breathing conduit 16 through the cannula 17. The
patient breathing conduit 16 can have a heater wire 16a to heat gas flow passing
through to the patient. The heater wire 16a is under the control of the controller
13. The patient breathing conduit 16 and/or patient interface 17 can be considered
part of the flow therapy apparatus 10, or alternatively peripheral to it. The flow
therapy apparatus 10, breathing conduit 16, and patient interface 17 together form
a flow therapy system.
[00103]       General operation of a flow therapy breathing apparatus 10 will be
known to those skilled in the art, and need not be described in detail here.
However, in general terms, the controller 13 controls the flow generator 11 to
generate a gas flow of the desired flow rate, controls one or more valves to control

                                           14
the mix of air and oxygen or other alternative gas, and controls the humidifier 12 if
present to humidify the gas flow and/or heat the gas flow to an appropriate level.
The gas flow is directed out through the patient breathing conduit 16 and cannula
17 to the patient. The controller 13 can also control a heating element in the
humidifier 12 and/or the heating element 16a in the patient breathing conduit 16 to
heat the gas to a desired temperature that achieves a desired level of therapy
and/or comfort for the patient. The controller 13 can be programmed with, or can
determine, a suitable target temperature of the gas flow.
[00104]       Operation sensors 3a, 3b, 3c, 20, and 25, such as flow, temperature,
humidity, and/or pressure sensors, can be placed in various locations in the flow
therapy apparatus 10 and/or the patient breathing conduit 16 and/or cannula 17.
Output from the sensors can be received by the controller 13, to assist it to operate
the flow therapy apparatus 10 in a manner that provides optimal therapy. In some
configurations, providing optimal therapy includes meeting a patient's inspiratory
demand. The apparatus 10 may have a transmitter and/or receiver 15 to enable
the controller 13 to receive signals 8 from the sensors and/or to control the various
components of the flow therapy apparatus 10, including but not limited to the flow
generator 11, humidifier 12, and heater wire 16a, or accessories or peripherals
associated with the flow therapy apparatus 10. Additionally, or alternatively, the
transmitter and/or receiver 15 may deliver data to a remote server or enable
remote control of the apparatus 10.
[00105]       The flow therapy apparatus 10 may be any suitable type of apparatus,
but in some configurations may deliver a high gas flow or high flow therapy (of e.g.
air, oxygen, other gas mixture, or some combination thereof) to a patient to assist
with breathing and/or treat breathing disorders. In some configurations, the gas is
or comprises oxygen. In some configurations, the gas comprises a blend of oxygen
and ambient air. 'High flow therapy' as used in this disclosure may refer to delivery
of gases to an adult patient at a flow rate of greater than or equal to about 10 liters
per minute (10 LPM), or to a neonatal, infant, or child patient at a flow rate of
greater than or equal to about 1 liter per minute (1 LPM). In some configurations,
for an adult patient 'high flow therapy' may refer to the delivery of gases to a
patient at a flow rate of between about 10 LPM and about 100 LPM, or between
about 15 LPM and about 95 LPM, or between about 20 LPM and about 90 LPM, or
between about 25 LPM and about 85 LPM, or between about 30 LPM and about 80
LPM, or between about 35 LPM and about 75 LPM, or between about 40 LPM and

                                            15
about 70 LPM, or between about 45 LPM and about 65 LPM, or between about 50
LPM and about 60 LPM. In some configurations, for a neonatal, infant, or child
patient 'high flow therapy' may refer to the delivery of gases to a patient at a flow
rate of greater than about 1 LPM, or between about 1 LPM and about 25 LPM, or
between about 2 LPM and about 25 LPM, or between about 2 LPM and about 5 LPM,
or between about 5 LPM and about 25 LPM, or between about 5 LPM and about 10
LPM, or between about 10 LPM and about 25 LPM, or between about 10 LPM and
about 20 LPM, or between about 10 LPM and 15 LPM, or between about 20 LPM and
about 25 LPM. Therefore, a high flow therapy apparatus for use with either an adult
patient or a neonatal, infant, or child patient, may deliver gases to the patient at a
flow rate of between about 2 LPM and about 100 LPM, or at a flow rate in any of the
sub-ranges outlined above. Gases delivered may comprise a percentage of oxygen.
In some configurations, the percentage of oxygen in the gases delivered may be
between about 20% and about 100%, or between about 30% and about 100%, or
between about 40% and about 100%, or between about 50% and about 100%, or
between about 60% and about 100%, or between about 70% and about 100%, or
between about 80% and about 100%, or between about 90% and about 100%, or
about 100%, or 100%.
[00106]       High flow therapy has been found effective in meeting or exceeding the
patient's inspiratory demand, increasing oxygenation of the patient and/or reducing
the work of breathing. Additionally, high flow therapy may generate a flushing
effect in the nasopharynx such that the anatomical dead space of the upper airways
is flushed by the high incoming gas flows. This creates a reservoir of fresh gas
available for each and every breath, while minimising re-breathing of carbon
dioxide, nitrogen, etc.
[00107]       The patient interface may be a non-sealing interface to prevent
barotrauma (e.g. tissue damage to the lungs or other organs of the respiratory
system due to difference in pressure relative to the atmosphere). The patient
interface may be a nasal cannula with a manifold and nasal prongs, and/or a face
mask, and/or a nasal pillows mask, and/or a nasal mask, and/or a tracheostomy
interface, or any other suitable type of patient interface.
[00108]       As described below, the flow therapy apparatus 10 has various
features to assist with the functioning, use, and/or configuration of the apparatus
10.

                                            16
2.      Overview of breathing assistance apparatus
[00109]       As shown in figure 2, the flow therapy apparatus 10 comprises a main
housing 100. The main housing 100 has a main housing upper chassis 102 and a
main housing lower chassis 104.
[00110]       The main housing has a peripheral wall arrangement. The peripheral
wall arrangement defines a humidifier or liquid chamber bay 108 for receipt of a
removable liquid chamber 300. The removable liquid chamber 300 contains a
suitable liquid such as water for humidifying gases that will be delivered to a
patient.
[00111]       The apparatus 10 has a tiltable handle/lever 141 that enables a user to
lift and carry the apparatus when in a raised position (figure 2), and that assists
with maintaining the liquid chamber 300 in engagement with the housing 100 when
in a lowered position.
[00112]       In the form shown, the main housing lower chassis 104 peripheral wall
arrangement comprises a substantially vertical left side outer wall 109 that is
oriented in a front-to-rear direction of the main housing 100, a substantially vertical
right side outer wall 111 (figure 3), and a substantially vertical rear outer wall 113
that extends between and connects the walls 109, 111. A bottom wall 115 extends
between and connects the lower ends of walls 109, 111, 113, and forms a base of
the apparatus and a substantially horizontal floor portion of the liquid chamber bay.
[00113]       The floor portion of the liquid chamber bay 108 has a recess to receive
a heater arrangement such as a heater plate or other suitable heating element(s)
for heating liquid in the liquid chamber 300 for use during a humidification process.
[00114]       The main housing lower chassis 104 is attachable to the upper chassis
102, either by suitable fasteners or integrated attachment features such as clips for
example. When the main housing lower chassis 104 is attached to the main housing
upper chassis 102, the walls of the upper and lower chassis engage with each
other.
[00115]       The apparatus has tongue and groove arrangements between
components of the apparatus to reduce water and oxygen ingress into the unit. The
apparatus advantageously has tongue and groove arrangements between the upper

                                           17
edges of the lower chassis walls and the lower edges of the upper chassis walls.
The tongue and groove arrangements provide a substantially continuous liquid/gas
flow-resistant coupling around the periphery of the upper and lower chassis parts
102, 104. For example, the lower chassis walls may be provided with grooves and
the upper chassis walls may be provided with complementary tongues that are
configured to be at least partly received in the respective grooves when the upper
and lower chassis parts are assembled together. The continuous coupling
advantageously extends along the front, sides, and at least most of the rear of the
chassis parts, as shown, including around any corners between those surfaces.
[00116]       The described configurations and orientations are examples only, and
any suitable combination of the tongue and groove arrangements and/or
orientations of the tongue and groove arrangements may be used in the apparatus.
[00117]       As shown in figure 3, the lower chassis 104 has a motor recess 121 for
receipt of a removable motor and/or sensor module. A recess opening is provided in
the bottom wall 115 adjacent a rear edge thereof, for receipt of the removable
motor/sensor module. Figure 3 shows a base 123 of the motor and/or sensor
module that covers the opening into the motor recess 121. The motor and/or
sensor module comprises a motor that forms a blower to cause gasflow, and may
comprise one or more sensors to sense properties of the gas passing through the
motor and/or sensor module.
[00118]       The motor and/or sensor module and housing of the apparatus 10 are
provided with suitable tubes and/or gasflow passages to deliver gases from one or
more gases inlets of the apparatus, to a gases inlet port of the liquid chamber 300
to humidify the gases. The gases are delivered from a gases outlet port of the liquid
chamber 300 to the patient outlet port 344 and thereby to the patient via the
patient breathing conduit 16 and patient interface.
[00119]       In the form shown, the motor recess 121 comprises a recess opening
in a bottom wall of the housing. Alternatively, the recess opening could be in a
different part of the housing, such as a side, front, or top of the housing.
[00120]       The apparatus 10 may have a battery 125 to provide power to the
apparatus when there is a power outage or for portable use. The battery may be
replaceable.

                                           18
[00121]       In the form shown, the battery is coupled to an exterior of the back
wall of the apparatus. This provides a large surface area to cool the battery and
reduces the amount of heat entering the apparatus from the battery. Additionally,
this configuration reduces the influence of heat generated by components of the
apparatus on the battery, particularly when the battery is being charged. In an
alternative configuration, the battery may be internally mounted in the main
housing.
[00122]       As shown in figure 2, the apparatus 10 has a mount 127 for mounting
the apparatus to a support as will be described in more detail below with reference
to figures 4 to 29.
[00123]       The mount 127 may be integrally formed with part of the main housing
of the apparatus. In the form shown, the mount 127 is integrally formed with the
left side wall 109 the lower chassis 104 of the housing. The mount 127 could
instead be integrally formed with any of the other walls of the housing, such as a
rear wall, right side wall, or other wall.
[00124]       The side of the apparatus corresponding to the mount 127 comprises a
recess 129. A downwardly projecting tongue 131 of the mount 127 has an upper
end that is integrally formed with the wall, and is positioned in the recess. A free,
lower end of the tongue 131 is provided with a protrusion in the form of a
projecting bump 133. The bump projects outwardly a greater distance than the
remainder of the tongue.
[00125]       The main housing of the apparatus may be formed from any suitable
material that will allow the mount 127 to be integrally formed. For example, the
case may be formed from polycarbonate.
[00126]       The integral mount 127 has greater impact strength compared to an
additional, screwed in part. Strengthening of the mount 127 may also be done by,
for example, varying the wall thickness, ribbing, or varying internal geometries.
3.      Support assembly
[00127]         Figures 4 to 39 show exemplary configurations of a support and
holder apparatus comprising a support assembly 200, 200', 300, 400 that can be
used to support and hold the apparatus 10 and/or accessories of the apparatus,

                                          19
such as the conduit 17, patient interface such as a cannula 19, a power cord of the
apparatus 10, and/or tubes from a liquid bag for delivering liquid to the liquid
chamber 300 for example.
[00128]         The support assembly 200 of figures 4 to 27f comprises a stand 201
and a holder 231.
[00129]         The stand 201 comprises a horizontally enlarged base 203 having a
relatively small vertical dimension and relatively large horizontal dimensions. The
base 203 comprises an upper surface 205 and a peripheral wall 207 that extends
downwardly from the upper surface 205. The shape of the periphery of the upper
surface 205 corresponds substantially to the shape of the housing of the breathing
assistance apparatus 10 in plan view. While in the form shown the base 203 has a
generally oblong shape in plan view, the shape of the base 203 may change
depending on the shape of the housing of the breathing assistance apparatus 10
that will be supported.
[00130]         The underside of the base 203 of the stand 201 comprises an under
surface 209 and a plurality of strengthening ribs 211. The ribs may be any suitable
shape or configuration to provide strength and rigidity to the base 203. A bottom
edge 213 of the peripheral wall 207 is arranged to contact a support surface such
as a floor, to support the support assembly 200 on the floor. If the strengthening
ribs 211 are of the same depth as the peripheral wall 207, the bottom edges of the
strengthening ribs will also contact the support surface.
[00131]         The upper surface 205 of the base 203 surrounds a recess 215 for
storage of one or more accessories of the breathing assistance apparatus 10. In the
form shown, the recess 215 has a depth of a few millimetres. However, in different
configurations, the upper surface 205 could be defined by one or more walls that
extend(s) upwardly from a periphery of the recess 215, to provide a deeper recess.
In other configurations, the recess 215 may not be provided, and the upper surface
205 of the base may be substantially planar.
[00132]         The upper surface 205 of the base 203 may have an optional
alignment feature 217 as shown in figures 12, 13, and 17 to assist with aligning the
holder 231 with the stand 203. In the form shown, the alignment feature comprises
an indented region that has a general T-shape. The indented region comprises a

                                          20
base portion 219 that extends from the recess 215 towards a periphery of the base,
a transversely extending portion 221 located adjacent the periphery of the base,
and two shortened extensions 223 that extend from the transverse portion 221 to
the periphery of the base. The alignment feature 217 could have a different
configuration. The alignment feature 217 may have the same depth as the recess
215 or may have a different depth.
[00133]        The stand 201 is configured to support the holder 231 in an
upstanding configuration from the base. An upstand spigot 225 extends upwardly
from a periphery of the base 203 to releasably mount the base 203 of the stand to
the holder 231. The upstand 225 has a tapered configuration in which the
dimensions of the upper end of the upstand 225 are smaller than the dimensions of
the lower end of the upstand. The upstand terminates at a top edge 227. The
tapering of the upstand 225 makes the shape easier to mould and improves
assembly as mating occurs only at the end of travel of the upstand into the lower
mount 253 of the holder 231. Engagement of the lower mount 253 with the
upstand 225 is described in more detail below.
[00134]        The upstand 225 could alternatively be a different shape. Exemplary
configurations are shown in side view in figures 27a to 27f. For example, the
upstand could be a straight non-tapered configuration such as a rectangular or
square configuration as shown in figure 27b. Such a configuration may require
greater force to engage and disengage the holder 231 to/from the upstand 225 due
to the increased interaction between the surfaces of the parts.
[00135]        Other exemplary shapes for the upstand 225 include a bulbous
configuration with an arcuate or semi-circular upper wall 227 as shown in figure
27a, a substantially U-shaped configuration with upper walls 227 that are
substantially perpendicular to elongate direction of the uprights of the U as shown
in figure 27c, a substantially U-shaped configuration with upper walls 227 that are
tapered or angled relative to the elongate direction of the uprights of the U as
shown in figure 27d, a narrower elongate upright with an arcuate or semi-circular
upper wall 227 as shown in figure 27e, or a pair of spaced apart uprights as shown
in figure 27f which may each, for example, have the configuration corresponding to
figure 27e or a different configuration. Other suitable shapes could also be used.

                                           21
[00136]        The shape of the lower mount 253 may be as described below or
could be a different shape that is complementary to any of the upstand 225 shapes.
[00137]        The upstand 225 is located at the periphery of the base 203 between
the transversely extending portion 221 and shortened extensions 223 of the
alignment recess.
[00138]        Referring to figures 18 to 24, the holder 231 for the conduit and/or
patient interface such as a cannula comprises an elongate upstanding component
comprising an upstand arm 233. A holder portion 235 is positioned at or adjacent
and at the end of the arm 233 and extends outwardly from one side of the arm. A
dual mount 251 is positioned at or toward an opposite lower end of the arm 233
and extends from the opposite side of the arm from the holder portion 235. Having
the holder portion 235 extending from an opposite side of the arm from the mount
251 is beneficial, as the holder portion will not interfere with the apparatus 10
being inserted into or removed from the mount 251. However, the holder portion
235 and the mount 251 may be provided on the same side of the arm 233 if the
arm 233 is sufficiently long to avoid that interference. The dual mount 251 is
arranged to releasably couple the holder 231 to the stand 201 and to releasably
couple the holder 231 to the breathing assistance apparatus 10.
[00139]        The holder portion 235 comprises at least one mechanical feature for
holding a conduit and/or patient interface such as a cannula of the breathing
assistance apparatus 10 in place relative to the support assembly 200 and relative
to the breathing assistance apparatus 10 when the breathing assistance apparatus
is supported by the support assembly 200. In the form shown, the holder portion
comprises an outer mechanical feature 237a and an inner mechanical feature 237b,
with one of the mechanical features being configured to support the conduit 16 and
the other of the mechanical features being configured to support the patient
interface such as a cannula 17.
[00140]        The outer mechanical feature 237a comprises a recess defined by an
outer wall 239, a base wall 241, and an intermediate wall 243. The inner
mechanical feature 237b comprises a recess defined by the intermediate wall 243,
a base wall 245 that is contiguous with the base wall 241, and an inner wall 247
that is contiguous with the arm 233. The inner mechanical feature 237b is larger
than the outer mechanical feature 237a, so that the larger and heavier accessory is

                                          22
supported closer to the arm 233. In different configurations, the mechanical
features could be the same size or the outer mechanical feature could be larger
than the inner mechanical feature.
[00141]        The holder portion 235 could comprise one, two, three, or more
mechanical features.
[00142]        The mechanical feature(s) has/have a shape that is complementary
to the shape of the conduit and/or patient interface such as a cannula to be held by
the mechanical feature(s). The mechanical feature(s) could have any suitable
configuration. For example, the mechanical feature(s) could comprise one or more
of: a recess or groove; a clip; a hinge mechanism; a compliant sling or strap; a
hook and loop fastener; or any other suitable configuration. In one configuration,
the mechanical features comprise two recesses, with one of the recesses configured
to receive the conduit and the other of the recesses configured to receive the
patient interface such as a cannula. In another configuration, the mechanical
feature(s) comprise(s) one or more compliant slings. In another configuration, the
mechanical feature(s) comprise(s) one or more clips. In another configuration, the
mechanical feature(s) comprise(s) one or more hook and loop fasteners that is/are
configured to secure around the conduit and/or patient interface such as a cannula
to hold the conduit and/or patient interface such as a cannula in position.
[00143]        When the holder has a plurality of mechanical features, different
mechanical features could be used in combination in the holder portion 235.
[00144]        The dual mount 251 comprises a lower mount 253 and an upper
mount 271.
[00145]        The lower mount 253 is arranged to releasably mount the holder 231
to the upstand 225 of the stand 201. Referring to figure 24 in particular, the lower
mount comprises a receptacle to receive the upstand 225. The receptacle is defined
by a wall 253 that is contiguous with the arm 233, a pair of spaced apart side walls
257, and an opposed wall 259. The receptacle has a shape that is complementary
to the shape of the upstand 225. In one configuration, the interior of the receptacle
has a tapered shape corresponding substantially to the tapered shape of the
upstand, such that the lower mount 253 and the upstand 225 will releasably lock
with a taper lock when the upstand 225 is engaged in the lower mount 253.

                                            23
Alternatively, the receptacle may have a shape that differs from the tapered shape
of the upstand 225, but surfaces of the upstand will engage with opposed walls of
the receptacle to lock the component together. The tapered configuration may
provide an insertion depth limitation of the upstand 225 into the receptacle. In
either configuration, the engagement will be sufficient that the support assembly
200 can be lifted by the holder 231 without the holder 231 disconnecting from the
stand 201.
[00146]        The receptacle may comprise a stop to prevent over-insertion of the
upstand 225 into the receptacle. For example, the stop may comprise a projection
or protrusion, or any other suitable configuration. The stop may be provided by an
upper wall of the receptacle.
[00147]        A portion of the wall 253 extends further downwardly than the wall
259, such that when the holder 231 is mounted to the stand 201, a bottom edge
261 of the wall 259 sits flush with the bottom edge 213 of the peripheral wall 207
of the base, as shown in figure 11. That enables the bottom edge 261 of the wall
259 to also contact the support surface to provide additional stability to the holder
231.
[00148]        A pair of relatively shallow side walls 263 extend inwardly from the
extended portion of the wall 253 and rest against the peripheral wall 207 of the
base 203. Referring to figures 13 and 24, lower edges 264 of side walls 257 have a
shape that is complementary to the shape of the two shortened extensions 223 of
the alignment feature, and are received in the two shortened extensions 223 when
the holder 231 is mounted to the stand 201. A lower edge 259a of the wall 259 has
a shape that is complementary to the shape of the transverse portion 221 of the
alignment feature, and is received in the transverse portion 221 when the holder
231 is mounted to the stand 201.
[00149]        A projecting rib 265 extends inwardly from the wall 259 of the lower
mount. A lower edge 265a of the rib has a shape that is complementary to the
shape of the base portion 219 of the alignment feature, and is received in the base
portion 219 when the holder 231 is mounted to the stand 201.
[00150]        The alignment feature assists with aligning the holder 231 with the
stand 201 as the upstand 225 is inserted into the lower mount 253, and with

                                            24
preventing rotation of the holder 231 relative to the stand 201 once the holder 231
is mounted to the stand 201. The rib 265 also assists with preventing inward tilting
of the holder 231 toward the centre of the stand under loading, improving the
stability of the holder.
[00151]         The lower mount 253 and stand 201 may have different
configurations while still providing for releasable coupling of the lower mount 253
and the stand 201. For example, rather than the upstand 225 being configured to
be received in the receptacle of the mount 253, the upstand 225 may be configured
to receive part of the mount 253. Alternative configurations may be used, such as
adhesive, a hook and loop fastener, a clip, a ridge and groove mechanism, or other
releasable connection for example.
[00152]         The lower mount 253 may be integral with the holder 231 or may be
separately formed and coupled to the holder 231.
[00153]         The releasable configuration of the holder 231 and the stand 201
allows for easy dismantling and/or transport.
[00154]         The upper mount 271 is arranged to releasably mount the holder 231
to the breathing assistance apparatus 10. Referring to figures 19 and 23, the upper
mount 271 comprises a receptacle having opposed slots formed by side walls 273,
relatively narrow front walls 275, and a rear wall 277 that extends between the side
walls. The rear wall 277 is wider than the front walls 275, so that the front walls
define an opening between the slots. The base of the receptacle is defined by a
bottom wall 279.
[00155]         In the form shown, the upper mount 271 and the lower mount 253
are positioned immediately adjacent each other so that a single wall 279 can form
the base of the receptacle of the upper mount 271 and the top of the receptacle of
the lower mount 253. In alternative configurations, the upper and lower mounts
may be spaced further apart, and may have separate walls forming the base of the
receptacle of the upper mount and the top of the receptacle of the lower mount.
[00156]         The receptacle of the upper mount 271 is arranged to receive the
tongue 131 of the mount 127 of the apparatus 10, by sliding the tongue
downwardly into the slots of the upper mount with the edges of the tongue received
between the shortened front walls 275 and the rear wall 277. The slots and the side

                                            25
walls 273 of the receptacle form alignment features to align the upper mount 271
with the complementary mount 127 of the breathing assistance apparatus. In
alternative configurations, different alignment feature(s) may be used, such as one
or more ribs, protrusions, and/or other features. The alignment feature(s) protect
against horizontal movement or misalignment of the support assembly 200 with the
apparatus 10 and assist with controlling the insertion extent of the tongue 131 of
the apparatus into the receptacle. Additionally, or alternatively, one or more stops
may be provided to limit the insertion extent of the tongue 131 into the receptacle.
[00157]          The upper mount 271 further comprises a connection feature to
releasably fasten the support assembly 200 to the breathing assistance apparatus
10. In the form shown, a protrusion in the form of a transverse bump 281 projects
into the receptacle of the mount from the wall 277. The bump 281 is configured to
engage with the bump 133 on the tongue 131 of the apparatus 10. As the tongue
131 is inserted into the receptacle of the upper mount 271, the tongue 131 will
resiliently flex so that the bump 281 can pass bump 133. The protrusions could
have different configurations, and could be positioned on different surfaces of the
mount and tongue.
[00158]          As shown in figure 25, when the apparatus 10 is mounted to the
support assembly 200, the bump 133 causes the apparatus to lean towards the wall
277 of the support assembly. Without the bump, a user may perceive the
apparatus leaning away from the stand (due to the base of the apparatus swinging
in towards the stand) and be concerned that the apparatus is not securely held. The
bump 133 therefore positions the apparatus such that it leans inwardly towards the
stand so that a user is unlikely to be concerned regarding the coupling between the
stand and the apparatus.
[00159]        The bump 133 may be configured to cause the unit apparatus to lean
                                                                   6
in towards the stand by any suitable angle. For example, angle       1 may be
approximately 1 - 150, or approximately 1 - 10*, or approximately 1-7*, or
approximately 1-50, or approximately 1 - 20. Therefore 62 is >0.
[00160]          The mounting will be sufficient that the apparatus 10 is securely held
with a reasonable buffer strength to hold the apparatus through likely usage cases
(e.g. a user leaning on the apparatus, accidental bumping of the apparatus),
whether or not the bump is present. The bump addresses the visual look and user's

                                           26
perception of the case. The mounting will be sufficient that if the user lifts the
apparatus 10 with normal force (for example to lift the apparatus off the floor), the
apparatus 10 will not disconnect from the support assembly.
[00161]        Due to the resilient nature of the tongue, if the user wants to
disconnect the apparatus 10 from the support assembly (for example, to put the
apparatus 10 in a storage case), they can achieve that by applying sufficiently large
upward force to the apparatus 10 and downward force to the support assembly
200.
[00162]        The position of the upper mount 271 on the holder 231 is such that
an underside 115 of the breathing assistance apparatus 10 will be positioned with a
spacing above a top surface 205, 215 of the base 203 of the stand 201, when the
breathing assistance apparatus 100 is coupled with the support assembly 200. The
spacing between the top surface 205, 215 of the base and the underside 115 of the
breathing assistance apparatus will advantageously be sufficient to provide a
storage space for accessories of the breathing assistance apparatus when they are
not in use. For example, a liquid bag and tubes for delivering liquid to the liquid
chamber 300, breathing conduit, and/or the power cord of the apparatus.
[00163]        In some configurations, the spacing between the upper surface of the
receptacle 215 and the underside 115 of the breathing assistance apparatus 10
may be between about 50 mm and about 150 mm, or may be between about 50
mm and about 100 mm, or may be between about 70 mm and about 90 mm, or
may be about 80 mm, for example. If a receptacle 215 is not provided, that may be
the spacing between the upper surface 205 of the base and the underside 115 of
the apparatus 10.
[00164]        The rib 265 on the holder 231 may also support the underside 115 of
the apparatus 10, to assist with holding the apparatus with the spacing above the
base 203. For example, the top surface 265b of the rib 265 may contact the
underside 115 of the apparatus 10. Alternatively, the apparatus 10 may be held
solely by the upper mount 251. In such a configuration, the rib 265 may not be
provided, or may have a different shape such as having a curved or angled upper
edge as shown in figure 4 for example. Figure 28 shows an alternative configuration
holder 231' that does not have a rib. The features and functionality are otherwise

                                           27
the same as described above, and like reference numerals indicate like parts with
the addition of a prime (').
[00165]         The upper portion of the upstand arm 233 is configured to be spaced
apart from the side wall 109 of the housing of the breathing assistance apparatus
10 when the apparatus 10 is coupled with the upper mount 271. Due to the spacing
between the upper portion of the upstand arm 233 (which may be straight) and the
side wall 109, the upper portion of the upstand arm 233 thereby has a hook-like
configuration, which enables a power cord of the apparatus 10 to be wrapped
around that upper portion of the arm 233 between the upper and the breathing
assistance apparatus 10, to store the power cord when the apparatus 10 is not in
use. Additionally or alternatively, the holder 231 may be provided with one or more
dedicated features for that purpose, such as hook(s), clip(s), protrusion(s), or a
curved portion added to the holder 231.
[00166]         The holder 231 is upstanding and is configured such that the
mechanical feature(s) 237a, 237b is/are located higher than the breathing
assistance apparatus 10 or at or adjacent to breathing assistance apparatus 10,
when the upper mount 271 is coupled with the breathing assistance apparatus 10.
Thereby, the conduit and/or patient interface such as a cannula is/are held above
the breathing assistance apparatus 10 or at or adjacent a top of the breathing
assistance apparatus 10, when the upper mount 271 is coupled with a breathing
assistance apparatus and the conduit and/or patient interface such as a cannula
is/are held by the mechanical feature(s). That means that the conduit and/or
patient interface such as a cannula will be easily accessible by a user when they
wish to use the apparatus, even if the support assembly 200 is positioned on the
floor. Holding the conduit and/or patient interface such as a cannula off the floor is
likely to reduce the likelihood of the conduit and/or patient interface such as a
cannula getting contaminated or dirty, which is particularly useful in a home
environment where a user is likely to reuse those accessories. There are possible
benefits relating to condensate drainage back to the liquid chamber 300/ambient
environment if the holder 231 holds the conduit and/or patient interface such as a
cannula higher than the main housing 100 of the apparatus 10. Because the holder
231 provides storage for the conduit and/or patient interface such as a cannula, the
used patient interface such as a cannula does not need to be placed on a bedside
table after use, but can instead be supported by the holder 231. Additionally or

                                           28
alternatively, the used patient interface such as a cannula could be positioned in
the space between the underside 115 of the breathing assistance apparatus 10 and
the top surface 205, 215 of the base 203.
[00167]         The support assembly 200 will typically be provided or used in
combination with a breathing assistance apparatus 10 having a conduit 16 and/or
patient interface such as a cannula 17. The support assembly may be provided as
an aftermarket component.
[00168]         The apparatus 10 can be coupled with the support assembly 200
which will be positioned on a support surface, either when the apparatus 10 is in
use or is not in use. When the apparatus 10 is not in use, the conduit 16 and/or
patient interface such as a cannula 17 will be held in place relative to the support
assembly 200 and the apparatus 10, and held above the support surface, by the
mechanical feature(s) 237a, 237b, as shown in figure 26 for example.
[00169]         The support assembly 200 provides a portable arrangement that is
easily placed on a support surface such as floor or table, and that keeps the conduit
and/or patient interface such as a cannula and apparatus 10 off the ground.
[00170]       The holder 231 may be used without the stand 201. With the holder
231 coupled to the apparatus 10, but with no stand 201, the holder holds the
conduit and/or patient interface such as a cannula in a raised position off the
support surface, but does not raise the apparatus 10 off the support surface. The
mounting between the holder 231 and the apparatus 10 will support the upstand
arm in an upright configuration from the apparatus 10. By combining the holder
231 and the stand 201 so that the apparatus 10 is raised, a larger battery 125 may
be used in the apparatus 10 because the battery can project downwardly beyond
the underside 115 of the apparatus 10 without requiring the apparatus to be tilted
on the support surface. A larger battery may typically have greater capacity,
allowing the device 10 to be used on battery power for longer.
[00171]       When the power cord is plugged into the apparatus, the power cord
can be downwardly vertically extending to reduce the horizontal footprint of the
apparatus and to provide a large bend radius on the cord. By having the apparatus
10 raised off the support surface, the power cord can be easily stored in the space
between the stand 201 of the holder 231 and the apparatus 10 even if the power

                                           29
cord is plugged into the apparatus. Alternatively, the power cord could be stored in
the space between the stand 201 of the holder 231 and the apparatus 10 when the
power cord is unplugged from the apparatus.
[00172]      The support assembly 200 can be made from any suitable material,
such as injection moulded plastic for example.
[00173]      Although the present disclosure has been described in terms of certain
embodiments, other embodiments apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art also
are within the scope of this disclosure. Thus, various changes and modifications
may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. For
instance, various components may be repositioned as desired. Features from any of
the described embodiments may be combined with each other and/or an apparatus
may comprise one, more, or all of the features of the above described
embodiments. Moreover, not all of the features, aspects and advantages are
necessarily required to practice the present disclosure. Accordingly, the scope of
the present disclosure is intended to be defined only by the claims that follow.
[00174]      The various configurations described are exemplary configurations
only. Any one or more features from any of the configurations may be used in
combination with any one or more features from any of the other configurations.
[00175]      For example, the support assembly 200 is described as having both a
holder 231 and a stand 201 that can be releasably coupled together. In an
alternative configuration, the holder and stand may be integrally formed, and the
upstand 225 and lower mount 253 may not be provided.
[00176]      As another example, while the support assembly or apparatus 200 is
described as having both a holder 231 and a stand 201, different configurations of
the apparatus may not have both features. For example, in some configurations,
the apparatus 200 may only comprise a holder 231 having a mount 271 for
releasably mounting the holder 231 to the breathing assistance apparatus 10.
Figure 29 shows such a configuration. In this configuration, the holder 231" does
not have a lower mount for mounting to a stand 201 but is provided with just the
upper mount 271". The holder 231" does not project any significant distance below
the mount 271" so that the bottom of the holder 231" does not project beyond the
underside 115 of the apparatus 10, and therefore does not interfere with the

                                           30
apparatus 10 sitting flat on a support surface. The features and functionality are
otherwise the same as described above for holder 231, and like reference numerals
indicate like parts with the addition of a double prime ("). In some other
configurations, the apparatus 200 may only comprise a stand 231 and a mount 271
for releasably mounting the stand 231 to the breathing assistance apparatus 10
with a spacing above the stand 231. The configurations shown in figures 18 to 24
and figure 28 could be releasably mounted to the apparatus 10 to act as a holder,
without using the stand 201.
[00177]       In another example, the support apparatus 200 may not be configured
to hold the breathing assistance apparatus with a spacing between the underside
115 of the breathing assistance apparatus 10 and the upper surface 205, 215 of the
base 203. In an alternative configuration, the mount 271 may be positioned so that
when the apparatus 10 is engaged with the mount, there may be substantially no
gap between the base 203 and the underside of the apparatus 115.
[00178]       In another alternative configuration, the breathing assistance
apparatus may be positioned on, and be supported by, the base 203. In such a
configuration, the base 203 and the housing of the breathing assistance apparatus
will be provided with complementary engagement features to locate the apparatus
on the base. Figure 3 shows an exemplary configuration of recesses 143 in the
underside 115 of the apparatus 10 to engage with engagement pins (not shown) on
an upper surface of the base. The recesses may be provided by apertures that
receive fasteners to couple the upper and lower housing parts 102, 104 together.
The fasteners could insert into the screw recesses on the underside of the lower
chassis part, or could protrude through the recesses into the upper chassis part to
join the upper and lower chassis parts together. The number and/or configuration
of engagement features may vary. The support apparatus 200 may be provided
with both the mount 271 and the engagement features. When a user wants to
transport the apparatus 10, they can disconnect the holder 231 from the apparatus
10 and from the stand 201, and can locate the apparatus 10 directly in position on
the base 203 using the engagement features to make the device more compact.
The pins and recesses may be configured so that they are aligned when the
apparatus 10 is positioned directly on the base 203 (whether or not the holder 231
is coupled to the stand 201), but so that they are misaligned when the apparatus
10 is engaged with the mount 271. When the pins and recesses are aligned, the

                                            31
device and stand can pack down to a small size for transportation. When the
apparatus 10 is engaged with the mount 271 and the pins and recesses are
misaligned, the pins may engage the underside 115 of the apparatus to assist with
supporting the apparatus 10 on the support assembly 200. The pins and recesses
(or other complementary engagement features) may be provided in combination
with, or instead of the rib 265.
[00179]       The mount 271 may be provided as part of the holder 231, the base
203 (e.g. on the upstand 225), or both the holder 231 and the base 203. The
mount 271 may be integrally formed with the holder 231 and/or base 203, or may
be formed separately but coupled to the holder 231 and/or base 203.
[00180]       As another example, while the support assembly 200 is described as
engaging with the side of the housing of the breathing assistance apparatus 10, the
support assembly could engage with any suitable part of the housing, such as an
upper part, lower part, side part, front part, or rear part.
[00181]       In another example, the support assembly could have a mechanical
feature designed for holding a liquid bag above the flow therapy apparatus 10. The
liquid bag could supply liquid to a liquid chamber 300 of the flow therapy apparatus
10, as described above. This would be beneficial in situations where the supplying
the liquid chamber 300 with liquid from the liquid bag requires the liquid bag to be
vertically higher than the liquid chamber 300. Allowing for a liquid bag to be used
to supply the liquid chamber 300 would increase the volume of liquid available and
reduce the frequency with which the user would need to refill the liquid chamber
300.
[00182]       Figure 30 shows such an exemplary configuration of a support
apparatus comprising a support assembly 300 having a mechanical feature 337c for
holding a liquid bag. Unless described below, the features and functionality are
otherwise the same as described above for support assembly 200, and like
reference numerals indicate like parts with the addition of 100. As can be seen from
the sizes of components in figure 30 compared to the sizes of components in figure
4, the upstand arm 333 is longer in this configuration compared to upstand arm
233. The upstand arm 333 of the holder 331 has a conduit and/or patient interface
such as a cannula holder portion 335 and a liquid bag holder portion 336. In the
form shown, the liquid bag holder portion 336 comprises a mechanical feature 337c

                                             32
for holding the liquid bag. The mechanical feature 337c is positioned at or adjacent
the upper end of the upstand arm 333, and comprises a recess that is formed
between a cantilevered member 337c' that extends transversely outwardly and
upwardly from the upstand arm 333, and an upper portion 337c" of the upstand
arm 333. The cantilevered member may be configured to be inserted into a loop or
aperture in the liquid bag (not shown) to hang the liquid bag from the upstand arm
333. The mechanical feature could be any other suitable shape, such as upwardly
opening U-shaped member, or any of the other configurations described in the
specification for the mechanical features for supporting the conduit and/or patient
interface such as a cannula, for example.
[00183]       Rather than being part of the holder 331, the mechanical feature 337c
for holding the liquid bag could be a holder that is separate from the holder 331;
for example, a separate upstanding arm that is integrally formed as part of, or is
mountable to, the stand 301. When the two holders are separate, the holder for the
liquid bag could be configured so that the mechanical feature 337c is located at the
same height, higher, or lower than the mechanical features 337a, 337b for holding
the conduit and/or patient interface such as a cannula. Ideally, the mechanical
feature 337c for holding the liquid bag would be vertically higher than the
mechanical feature(s) 337a, 337b so that the liquid bag can be positioned high
enough for the liquid bag to adequately deliver liquid to the liquid chamber 300.
[00184]       The mechanical feature 337c for the liquid bag could project from the
front, rear, left side, or right side of the upstanding arm 333. The mechanical
feature 337c for holding the liquid bag is advantageously on an opposite face of the
arm to the mechanical features 337a, 337b for holding the conduit and/or patient
interface such as a cannula in order to balance out the moment and reduce stress
on the arm. As described in relation to support assembly 200, the mechanical
features 337a, 337b for holding the conduit and/or patient interface such as a
cannula may advantageously be on the opposite side of the upstanding arm 333
from the mount 351 to avoid interfering with the breathing assistance apparatus 10
being inserted into or being removed from the mount 351. As such, the mechanical
feature 337c for holding the liquid bag may be on the side of the upstanding arm
333 that the breathing assistance apparatus 10 mounts to. The mechanical feature
337c for holding the liquid bag may advantageously be vertically higher than the
mechanical features 337a, 337b for holding the conduit and/or patient interface

                                           33
such as a cannula, and as such would have less chance of interfering with the with
the breathing assistance apparatus 10 being inserted into or being removed from
the mount 351.
[00185]       Although the liquid bag holder portion 336 is shown in the holder 331
of a support assembly 300 with a conduit and/or patient interface holder portion
335, a mount 351, and a stand 301 comprising a base 303, the liquid bag holder
portion 336 could alternatively be used in combination with any of the various
designs for other features described in the specification. For example, the liquid bag
holder portion 336 and/or the conduit and/or patient interface holder portion 335
could be used in a holder apparatus that mounts to the apparatus 10 such as that
shown in figure 29, but that does not include a stand/base.
[00186]       The stand 301 and holder 331 could be integrally formed as one piece.
Alternatively, certain sections of the support assembly 300 could be releasably
coupled to each other. For example, the holder 331 could be releasably coupled to
the stand 301 as described for support assembly 200. The conduit and/or patient
interface holder portion 335 and the liquid bag holder portion 336 could be
integrally formed as part of a one piece upstand arm 333. Alternatively, or in
addition, the conduit and/or patient interface holder portion 335 could be formed on
a lower part 333b of the upstand arm 333, and the liquid bag holder portion 336
could be formed on an upper part 333a of the upstand arm, and the upper part
333a of the upstand arm may releasably couple to the lower part 333b of the
upstand arm. The coupling mechanism for coupling the upper part 333b of the
upstand arm to the lower part 333a of the upstand arm could be the same as any
of the coupling mechanisms described herein for coupling the holder 231/231' to
the stand 201. Figure 31 illustrates one exemplary configuration in which a tapered
member 334a extends downwardly from a lower shoulder 334b on the upper part
333a and is configured for receipt in a cavity 334c in the lower part 333b to
releasably mount the upper and lower parts together.
[00187]       Having multiple members that can be assembled and disassembled
offers advantages in terms of easier packaging. Additionally, having the upper part
333a of the holder 331 for holding the liquid bag removable is useful in situations
where the user does not want and/or require a liquid bag, such as when using a
humidifier that is not designed to be used with a liquid bag. This would allow for

                                           34
removal of the upper part 333a of the upstand arm when not in use to provide a
more compact stand and holder apparatus.
[00188]       In another example, instead of having the mechanical features 237a,
237b for holding the conduit and/or patient interface such as a cannula positioned
next to one another, the holder could have two separate features 437a, 437b
spaced out vertically, one for holding the patient interface such as a cannula and
one for holding the conduit. An exemplary configuration is shown in figures 32 to
35. Unless described below, the features and functionality are otherwise the same
as described above for support assembly 200 and 300, and like reference numerals
indicate like parts with the addition of 200 and 100 respectively.
[00189]       In this configuration, the patient interface holder portion 435a is
positioned vertically higher than the conduit holder portion 435b. The patient
interface holder portion 435a comprises a mechanical feature 437a for holding the
patient interface such as a cannula and the conduit holder portion 435b comprises a
mechanical feature 437b for holding the conduit. The mechanical feature 437a for
holding the patient interface such as a cannula may be smaller than that for holding
the conduit. In figure 32, the patient interface holder portion 435a is above the
conduit holder portion 435b; however, this could be reversed. The mechanical
features 437a, 437b may be located on the outside of the upstand arm 433 to avoid
interfering with the breathing assistance apparatus 10 being inserted into or being
removed from the mount 451.
[00190]       A support member in the form of an upwardly projecting member 466
could be located on the opposite side of the base of the stand 401 to further
support the breathing assistance apparatus 10 in the desired position with a
spacing above the base. The support member 466 could be used in addition to the
projecting rib 265, 365, 465, or instead could be used without the projecting rib
265, 365, 465. The upwardly projecting member 466 assists with reducing stress
and preventing a large moment being generated at the mount 451. In the form
shown, the upwardly projecting member 466 is on an opposite side of the stand
401 to the first projecting rib 465. In an alternative configuration, upwardly
projecting member(s) could instead be positioned at or toward a front and/or rear
of the stand, but at least half way across the stand 401 from the position of the
mount 451. However, having a single upwardly projecting member 466 on the
opposite side of the stand is preferred, because it that leaves space available at the

                                            35
front and rear of the stand for inserting accessories into the space between the
stand and the breathing assistance apparatus 10. The upwardly projecting member
466 may advantageously be a configuration that has a long dimension in a front
rear direction of the stand 401 and a small dimension in a transverse direction of
the stand, to minimise encroachment of the upwardly projecting member 466 into
the space under the apparatus 10. Alternatively, the upwardly projecting member
could have any other suitable configuration. The upwardly projecting member(s)
could be provided in any of the stands 201, 301, 401, 401' described herein.
[00191]       The upstand arm 433 could have a separate holder portion 435c for
holding the patient interface such as a cannula and/or conduit, either in addition to
holder portions 435a, 435b or instead of one or both of holder portions 435a, 435b.
This feature is illustrated in figures 32 to 35, where the mechanical feature 437c for
holding the water bag is on the left and a separate mechanical feature 437d for
holding the patient interface such as a cannula and/or conduit is on the right.
[00192]       The separate mechanical feature 437d for holding the patient interface
such as a cannula and/or conduit could be similar to any of the previous described
configurations. However, due to the increased vertical distance from the breathing
assistance apparatus 10, it may not be necessary to have mechanical features for
holding both the patient interface such as a cannula and the conduit. Instead one
feature 437d could be used to hold the patient interface such as a cannula, and the
increased distance would prevent the conduit from coiling and getting tangled,
removing the need for a separate conduit holding mechanical feature 437b. Another
option is to have one feature that is used to hold the conduit with the patient
interface such as a cannula hanging from the conduit end.
[00193]       The mechanical feature 437c for holding the liquid bag is shown in
figure 35 to be positioned vertically higher than the mechanical feature 437d for
holding the conduit and/or patient interface such as a cannula. Each mechanical
feature would be located based on its corresponding accessory, and could be
located differently from what is shown. The mechanical feature 437c for holding the
liquid bag would likely be as high as possible to provide a vertical distance of the
bag above the breathing assistance apparatus 10. The mechanical feature 437d for
holding the patient interface such as a cannula would be located based on the
length of the conduit.

                                           36
[00194]       The assembled form of this configuration is shown in figure 32. Due to
the large space that the liquid bag would occupy, the mechanical feature 437d for
holding the patient interface such as a cannula and/or conduit is on the opposite
side of the upstand arm 433 to the mechanical feature 437c for holding the liquid
bag. In the configuration shown, the mechanical feature 437d for holding the
patient interface such as a cannula is on the same side of the upstand arm 433 as
the breathing assistance apparatus, while the mechanical feature 437c for holding
the liquid bag is on the opposite side of the upstand arm 433. This orientation has a
number of advantages. The liquid bag being on the opposite side of the upstand
arm from the breathing assistance apparatus prevents the liquid bag from
obscuring the display and/or user interface of the breathing assistance apparatus.
The patient interface such as a cannula and conduit would only obscure the display
and/or user interface when they are hung on the holder and are not in use, and as
such the display and/or user interface would not be needed to be used anyway. A
full liquid bag will also be heavier than the patient interface such as a cannula and
conduit, so putting it opposite the breathing assistance apparatus 10 would best
counteract the weight of the breathing assistance apparatus 10. The patient
interface such as a cannula would likely be removed more frequently than the liquid
bag. Since the support assembly 400 would likely be oriented with the breathing
assistance apparatus 10 facing the user, the mechanical feature 437d for holding
the patient interface such as a cannula is advantageously on this side, so the
patient interface such as a cannula is accessible to the user. Having a sufficiently
long conduit and a sufficiently high mechanical feature 437d would mean that the
hanging patient interface such as a cannula and/or conduit, and the mechanical
feature 437d, should not interfere with insertion and removal of the breathing
assistance apparatus 10 onto the mount 451.
[00195]       As discussed for support assembly 300, the upper part 433a of the
upstand member may be removably coupled to the lower part 433b of the upstand
member 433b. This would allow the patient to remove the upper part 433a when a
liquid bag is not being used. As such, it may be beneficial to have mechanical
features 437a, 437b, 437d for holding the patient interface such as a cannula
and/or conduit on both the upper part 433 and the lower part 433b of the upstand
member 433, as shown in figures 34 and 35. This would allow for the user to hang
the patient interface such as a cannula in the higher position when using the liquid

                                           37
bag holder, but still allow for the patient interface such as a cannula and conduit to
be supported when the liquid bag holder is not being used.
[00196]       Although the liquid bag holder portion 436 and separate conduit and/or
patient interface holder portion 435c are shown in the holder 433 of a support
assembly 400 with additional conduit and/or patient interface holder portions 435a,
435b, a mount 451, and a stand 401 comprising a base 403, those features could
alternatively be used in combination with any of the various designs for other
features described in the specification. For example, the liquid bag holder portion
436 and/or the separate conduit and/or patient interface holder portion 435c could
be used in a holder apparatus that mounts to the apparatus 10 such as that shown
in figure 29, but that does not include a stand/base.
[00197]       In another example, the support assembly 400' and the breathing
assistance apparatus 10' may have optional complementary fastening features that
clip the breathing assistance apparatus 10' to the mount 451', to enhance positive
engagement between the breathing assistance apparatus 10' and the mount 451'.
This would allow the breathing assistance apparatus 10' to be lifted without the
support assembly 400' disconnecting and falling out from below it. An exemplary
configuration of a support assembly 400' and the breathing assistance apparatus
10' is shown in figures 36 to 39. Unless described below, the features and
functionality are otherwise the same as described above for support assembly 400
and breathing assistance apparatus 10, and like reference numerals indicate like
parts with the addition of a prime (').
[00198]       Figure 25 shows a bump on the outer wall of the apparatus 10 that
engages with a corresponding bump on the inner wall of the mount 251. In an
alternative configuration, only one of the apparatus 10 and the mount 251 may
have a bump. One function of these bumps is to angle the breathing assistance
apparatus, as described in the specification. The bumps may be redundant when
the upwardly projecting support member 466' is employed in the base 403', as this
would support the apparatus 10' in the desired orientation.
[00199]       In order to provide the clipping feature described above, the breathing
assistance apparatus 10' could have an indented portion 133' in the form of a
recess that engages with the projecting member or bump 481' on the mount, as
shown in figures 36 to 39. The indented portion 133' is positioned on the tongue

                                           38
131', such that when the breathing assistance apparatus 10' is inserted into the
mount 451', the tongue 131' will resiliently flex upon contact with the bump 481'.
The tongue 131' will return to its regular unflexed position once the bump 481'
engages with the corresponding indented portion 133'. The features is designed
such that the force required to disengage the bump 481' from the indented portion
133' is greater than the weight force of the support assembly 400' combined with
any potential accessory components attached. The features could alternatively be
reversed, with the projecting bump being positioned on the tongue 131' of the
breathing assistance apparatus and the corresponding indented portion being
located on the mount 451'. With this configuration, the angling function provided by
the bumps of figure 25 will not be present.
[00200]      The bump 481' and indented portion 133' could be used in combination
with any of the various designs for other features described in the specification.
[00201]      The support assembly is described with reference to a flow therapy
apparatus that is capable of delivering heated and humidified gases to a patient or
user. The apparatus may be suitable for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD). The apparatus may be configured to deliver gases to a patient
interface at a high flow rate (high flow therapy), particularly nasal high flow
therapy.
[00202]      Alternatively, the support assembly may be used with an apparatus for
a different purpose. The apparatus may be a high flow therapy apparatus, or may
be a low flow therapy apparatus. For example, the features may be provided in an
apparatus for providing continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which may
deliver gases (humidified or otherwise) at lower flow rates.
[00203]      The support assembly may alternatively be used with an apparatus
that does not require a humidifier and therefore does not require the liquid
chamber 300 or chamber bay 108 features. The support assembly has broad
applications in other types of gas delivery apparatuses.
[00204]      The 'flow therapy apparatus' language is intended to cover all such
variants.

                                            39
[00205]      The support assembly could be configured and used to support any
suitable patient interface, such as the patient interfaces described in the
Introduction section from paragraphs [00101] to [00108] for example.
[00206]       Reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be
taken as, an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms
part of the common general knowledge in the field of endeavour in any country in
the world.
[00207]      Where reference is used herein to directional terms such as 'up',
'down', 'forward', 'rearward', 'horizontal', 'vertical' etc, those terms refer to when
the apparatus is in a typical in-use position and/or with reference to particular
orientations shown in the figures, and are used to show and/or describe relative
directions or orientations.
