 [DESCRIPTION]
 [Title]
INFORMATION PROCESSING APPARATUS,                 INFORMATION PROCESSING
METHOD, AND PROGRAM
 [Technical Field]
 [0001]
The present disclosure relates to an information
processing apparatus, an information processing method,
and a program, and particularly to an information
processing apparatus, an information processing method,
and a program suitable for use in a case where content
displayed on a certain screen device which configures a
home network is identified by an ACR                 (Automatic Content
Recognition) service and metadata corresponding to the
content is displayed on a different                 screen device or an
application is executed in accordance with the
progression of the content.
 [Background Art]
 [0002]
For example, it is supposed to display, to a viewer of a
TV       (television) program, information           (performers, a plot
outline, a trailer and so forth) relating to the TV
program                 (hereinafter referred to simply as program) being
broadcast, information useful to a viewer                  (news, weather
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                   2
forecast, traffic information and so forth) although it
does not have a direct relationship to the program, and
so forth on the screen.
 [0003]
In order to implement this, a command used to acquire and
start up an application program for exclusive use
 (hereinafter referred to simply as application) may be
transmitted to a TV receiver or the like in a linked
relationship with the progression of the program.
Actually, in Japan, Europe and so forth, this has been
implemented by transmitting the command or the
application making use of a frequency band for data
broadcasting in a TV broadcasting signal                        (refer to, for
example,                 PTL 1)
 [0004]
In the meantime, in the United States,                        a frequency band
for data broadcasting is not provided in a TV
broadcasting signal, and a replacing method is not
established.                       Therefore,  it has not been implemented to
execute an application in a linked relationship with the
progression of a program.
 [0005]
It      is to be noted that,                  in the United States, the number
of households in which a program                        is viewed through a CATV,
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                   3
an IPTV or the like is greater than the number of
households in which a TV broadcasting wave is received
directly by and viewed on a TV receiver.  Since the CATV
or the IPTV sometimes extracts only video and audio
signals of a program from a TV broadcasting signal and
distributes the video and audio signals, even if a
frequency band for data broadcasting is provided in a TV
broadcasting signal in the United states, there is no
guarantee that a data broadcasting signal including an
application and related data is transmitted to a
reception apparatus.
 [0006]
Further, it is requested recently to execute, even in a
case in which not only a program being broadcast but also
a program recorded, videos reproduced from a package
medium such as a DVD or a BD, moving pictures, music or
the like downloaded through the Internet  (such programs
and so forth mentioned are hereinafter referred to as
content) are being viewed, an application in a linked
relationship with the progression of the content.
 [0007]
In order to implement this request, it is necessary to
identify the piece of content being viewed, and as one
method therefor, a technique called ACR  (Automatic
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                    4
Content Recognition)                        service is available  (refer, for
example,                 to PTL 2)
 [0008]
The ACR service is implemented by an ACR client and an
ACR server.                        The ACR client,  which is incorporated  in a
content reproduction apparatus                        such as a TV receiver,
extracts, from content being viewed, signature data
representative of a characteristic of the content and
notifies the ACR server to request identification of the
content.                   The ACR server compares the received signature
data with signature data of content recorded in a
database in advance to identify the content being viewed
on the content reproduction apparatus.                         Further, the ACR
server issues an ACR response including metadata relating
to the identified content and information indicative of
an application to be executed in a linked relationship
 (such application is hereinafter referred to as linked
application) to the ACR client.
 [0009]
The content reproduction apparatus in which the ACR
client which receives the response is incorporated
acquires a linked application from a predetermined server
and executes the linked application.

 [Summary]
 [Technical Problems]
 [0011]
Incidentally, in the United States, as a result of
popularization of a CATV, an IPTV and so forth, a TV
receiver is positioned as a displaying outputting device
of an external apparatus such as a set top box of a CATV,
an IPTV or the like as described above.
 [0012]
Therefore, a user has              few opportunities to operate a
remote controller of a TV receiver but frequently
operates a remote controller of the external apparatus.
Therefore, there is the possibility that an operation for
a linked application started up in a TV receiver as a
content reproduction apparatus which is operated by a
remote controller of the TV receiver may not be favorable
in convenience in use to the user.
 [0013]
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                 6
Accordingly, taking the convenience to a user into
consideration, a request to cause a second screen device,
which is different from a content reproduction apparatus
 (TV receiver or the like) in which an ACR client is
incorporated, to display metadata relating to content
being viewed on the content reproduction apparatus or to
execute a linked application has been and is being
generated.
 [0014]
Here, as the second screen device, for example, a tablet
type terminal, a slate PC, a smartphone and so forth can
be listed.
 [0015]
Further, in recent years, a second screen device of the
type which can operate the external apparatus with a
predetermined application program started up in the
second screen device, namely, of the type which can be
utilized as a remote controller for the external
apparatus,                     is  available. Therefore, implementation of the
request described above is desired also from a point of
view that operation inputting devices for a content
reproduction apparatus and an external apparatus are
consolidated on the second screen device.
 [0016]
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                   7
Furthermore, mainly in the United States, there is a
tendency that the screen size of a TV receiver and so
forth as a content reproduction apparatus becomes greater
than 50 to 60 inches, and a utilization form in which a
plurality of pieces of content different        from each other
are displayed and viewed simultaneously on the screen of
the increased size begins to be gradually popularized.
Accordingly, it is necessary to consider also a
utilization form in which an ACR client is built in a TV
receiver or the like which has       such a large-sized screen
and is linked with a second screen device.         In the
following description, a TV receiver or the like which
has a large-sized screen and can display a plurality of
different pieces of content at the same time is referred
to as a multi-window screen device.
 [0017]
FIG. 1 is a schematic view of a space in a case where it
is assumed to link a multi-window screen device in which
an ACR client is built and a second        (2nd) screen device
with each other to utilize an ACR service and the devices
are disposed in a home of a user or the like.
 [0018]
In FIG. 1, a multi-window screen device 1-1 is installed
on the front of the user, and a multi-window screen
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                    8
device 1-2 is installed on a left side wall.                         A second
screen device 3 is disposed in the proximity of the user.
 [0019]
A plurality of                        (in the case of FIG. 1, three) windows can
be provided on the multi-window screen device 1-1, and
different pieces of content                        (which may be the same as
each other) can be displayed at the same time in the
windows.                   In      the following description,  for example, the
piece of content displayed in a window A is referred to
as content A.                        This similarly applies also to the other
pieces of content displayed in the other windows.
 [0020]
The multi-window screen device 1-1 can transfer an ACR
response, which includes an identification result and so
forth of the pieces of content displayed in the windows,
to the second screen device 3 by utilizing an ACR service.
 [0021]
Also the multi-window screen device 1-2 is similar to the
multi-window screen device 1-1.                         However, in FIG. 1, the
multi-window screen device 1-2 is in a state in which
only a window X is provided on the screen thereof and a
content X is displayed in the window X.
 [0022]
The second screen device 3 can simultaneously display
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                   9
metadata corresponding to the pieces of content displayed
in the windows of the multi-window screen device 1-1 or
the multi-window screen device 1-2 and a started-up
linked application in accordance with the progression of
the content.
 [0023]
In the case of FIG. 1, the second screen device 3 is in a
state in which a linked application A to the content A of
the window A, another linked application C to the content
C of the window C and metadata X of the content X of the
window X are displayed simultaneously.
 [0024]
In the case where the utilization form illustrated in FIG.
1 is assumed, there is the possibility that the user may
not be able to rapidly grasp a corresponding relationship
of the pieces of information       (videos of the linked
applications and metadata) displayed on the screen of the
second screen device 3 to the pieces of content displayed
in the windows of the multi-window screen devices 1-1 and
1-2.
 [0025]
Accordingly, a contrivance allowing a user to rapidly
grasp a corresponding relationship between a plurality of
pieces of content which can be displayed simultaneously
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                 10
in the windows of the multi-window screen devices 1-1                       and
1-2        and a plurality of pieces of information                (videos of
linked applications and metadata) which can be displayed
on the second screen device 3 is required.
 [0026]
The present disclosure has been made in view of such a
situation as described above and makes it possible for a
user to rapidly grasp a corresponding relationship
between a plurality of pieces of content which can be
displayed simultaneously and information which is
displayed separately.

 [Description of Embodiment]
 [0053]
In the following, a best mode for carrying out the
present disclosure                     (hereinafter referred to as
embodiment) is described in detail with reference to the
drawings.
 [Outline of ACR Service Utilization System]
FIG. 2 shows an outline of an ACR service utilization
system which is an embodiment of the present disclosure.
The ACR service utilization system includes multi-window
screen devices 40-1 and 40-2 and a second screen device
50 which have a built-in ACR client and causes the
devices to link with each other to utilize an ACR service.
 [0054]
In FIG. 2, the multi-window screen device 40-1 is
installed on the front of a user, and the multi screen
device 40-2 is installed on a left side wall.                      In the
proximity of the user, the second screen device 50 is
disposed.
 [0055]
A plurality of                     (in the case of FIG. 2, three) windows can
be provided on a screen of the multi-window screen device
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                  25
40-1,          and pieces of content different                from each other
 (which may be the same as each other) can be displayed in
the windows simultaneously.                       In the following description,
for example, the piece of content displayed in a window A
is      referred                 to as content A.  This similarly    applies  also
to the other pieces of content displayed in the other
windows.
 [0056]
Further, the multi-window screen device 40-1 can transfer
an ACR response, which includes an identification result
and so forth of the pieces of content displayed in the
windows, to the second screen device 50 by utilizing the
ACR service.
 [0057]
Furthermore, the multi-window screen device 40-1 can
provide, to a frame of each window, an attribute
 (hereinafter referred to as frame visual attribute) which
can be visually distinguished from frames of the other
windows                 (including the window of the multi-window screen
device 40-2).
 [0058]
As the frame visual attribute, a color, a thickness and a
type of a frame line, a depth of three-dimensional
display and so forth which can be set and changed by the
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                26
CSS         (Cascading Style Sheets)             can be listed.   In the case
of FIG. 2, the frame line of each window is set different
from those of the frames of the other windows, and the
frame line of the window A is set to an alternate long
and short dash line;                    the frame line of the window B is
set to a solid line;                    and the frame line of the window C
is set to a broken line.
 [0059]
The multi-window screen device 40-2 is similar to the
multi-window screen device 40-1.                      However, in FIG. 2, the
multi-window screen device 40-2 is in a state in which
only a window X is provided on the screen thereof and the
frame line of the window X is set to an alternate long
and two short dashes line to display content X.
 [0060]
In the second screen device 50,                     metadata corresponding to
the pieces of content displayed in the windows of the
multi-window screen devices 40-1 and 40-2 and a linked
application conforming to the progression of the content
can be started up and displayed.
 [0061]
Further, in the second screen device 50,                      it is possible
to provide a frame to each piece of information to be
displayed                    (a screen image of metadata or a linked
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                   27
application corresponding to the content) and set, to the
frame, a frame visual attribute similar to that of the
frame of the window in which the corresponding content is
displayed.
 [0062]
In particular, in the case of FIG. 2, the second screen
device 50 is in a state in which the linked application A
corresponding to the content A of the window A is
displayed in the frame of an alternate long and short
dash line;                     the linked application C corresponding to the
content C of the window C is displayed in the frame of a
broken line;                       and metadata X corresponding to the content
X of the window X is displayed in the frame of an
alternate long and two short dashes line,                       simultaneously.
It      is to be noted that,                  also in a case in which such
pieces of information are not displayed simultaneously
but are displayed switchably, a frame visual attribute
similar to that of the frame of the window in which the
corresponding content is displayed can be set to the
frame.
 [0063]
 [Example of Configuration of ACR Service Utilization
System]
FIG. 3 shows an example of a configuration of the ACR
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                              28
service utilization system of the embodiment of the
present disclosure.
 [0064]
This ACR service utilization system 10 identifies more
than one piece of content displayed simultaneously on the
screens of the multi-window screen devices 40-1 and 40-2
such as a TV receiver having a large-sized screen and
presents metadata relating to the pieces of content to
the user through the second                   (2nd) screen device 50 or
executes a linked application in conformity with the
progression of the content.                   In the following description,
in the case where there is no necessity to individually
distinguish the multi-window screen devices 40-1 and 40-2
from each other, each of them is referred to merely as
multi-window screen device 40.
 [0065]
Here, a piece of content is not limited to a program
being broadcast.                   In particular, all AV content such as,
for example, a program recorded and reproduced by an
external apparatus such as a video recorder connected to
the multi-window screen device 40,                   a video of a cinema or
the like reproduced from a package medium, and a moving
picture and music downloaded through the Internet or the

10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                             29
message                 (hereinafter referred to as CM) inserted between
programs or midway of a program is included in the
content.
 [0066]
For the identification of a piece of content, the ACR
service is utilized in which signature data                 (for example,
a watermark or a fingerprint) extracted periodically from
the piece of content being viewed and representative of a
characteristic of the piece of content is compared with
signature data of pieces of content registered in a
database in advance to identify the piece of content.
 [0067]
The ACR service utilization system 10                 is configured from
a provider system 20 on the side which supplies content
and a linked application and so forth corresponding to
the content, and a home network system 30 on the user
side who views content or utilizes a linked application.
 [0068]
The provider system 20 and the home network system 30 are
connected to each other through a broadcasting network 11
and a bidirectional communication network 12.                  Here, the
broadcasting network 11 includes a TV broadcasting
network, a CATV network, an IPTV network and so forth.
The bidirectional communication network 12                 is an IP
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                 30
communication network represented by the Internet.
 [0069]
It is to be noted that, in FIG. 3, lines between the
multi-window screen device 40-2 belonging to the home
network system 30 and the provider system 20 through the
broadcasting network 11 and the bidirectional
communication network 12 are omitted.
 [0070]
 [Description of Provider System 20]
The provider system 20 is configured from a content
server 21, a metadata server 22, an application server 23
and an ACR server 24.
 [0071]
The content server 21 broadcasts content such as a
program or a CM through the broadcasting network 11.
Further, the content server 21 supplies content to be
broadcast to the ACR server 24.                      It is to be noted that,
in place of supplying content, a content identifier and
signature data extracted in advance from the content may
be supplied to the ACR server 24.
 [0072]
The metadata server 22 supplies metadata corresponding to
content broadcast from the content server 21 to the ACR
server 24.                      The metadata includes various kinds of
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                   31
information relating to the content, an identifier
representative of a linked application to be executed in
accordance with the progression of the content, data to
be used in the linked application and so forth.
 [0073]
The application server 23 supplies an application and
data to be utilized in the application through the
bidirectional communication network 12 in accordance with
a request from the second screen device 50 of the home
network system 30.
 [0074]
The ACR server 24 generates in advance ACR reference data
in which a content identifier, an application identifier
and so forth are coordinated with signature data
extracted in a predetermined sampling period from various
pieces of content which can be viewed on the multi-window
screen device 40 of the home network system 30 to form a
database and retains the database.    The ACR server 24
generates an ACR response in response to an ACR query
transmitted from any of ACR clients 42A to 42C of the
multi-window screen device 40 based on the database of
the ACR reference data, and transmits the ACR response.
 [0075]
It is to be noted that the content server 21, metadata
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                 32
server 22,                     application server 23 and ACR server 24 which
configure the provider system 20 may be disposed in a
concentrated manner at one place or may be disposed
separately in a decentralized fashion.                      Alternatively,
some of the components may be combined suitably.                      Further,
a plural number of servers may be provided for each of
the component servers.
 [0076]
 [Description of Home Network System 30]
The home network system 30 is configured from the multi
window screen device 40 such as a TV receiver having a
large-sized screen, and the second screen device 50                      such
as a tablet type terminal, a slate PC or a smartphone.
The multi-window screen device 40 and the second screen
device 50 are connected to each other, for example, by a
wireless LAN.
 [0077]
It      is to be noted that a plurality of such multi-window
screen devices 40 and a plurality of such second screen
devices 50 may be provided in the home network system 30.
 [0078]
The multi-window screen device 40 provides a plurality of
windows on the screen thereof and displays different
pieces of content simultaneously in the windows so as to
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                              33
be viewed by the user.                   The multi-window screen device 40
includes a content renderer 41,                   an ACR client 42, a UPnP
 (Universal Plug and Play) server 43, a local Web server
44,        and a window manager 45.            The number of such content
renderers 41 and the number of such ACR clients 42 equal
to the number of windows which can be set by the multi
window screen device 40 are incorporated.
 [0079]
In the present embodiment, it is assumed that the multi
window screen device 40 can provide three windows A, B
and C on the screen thereof.                   In this instance, it is
assumed that three content renderers 41A, 41B and 41C and
three ACR clients 42A, 42B and 42C are incorporated
correspondingly.                   The number of windows which can be set
is not limited to three.                   In the following description,
where there is no necessity to individually distinguish
the content renderers 41A, 41B and 41C from one another,
each of them is referred to simply as content renderer 41.
This similarly applies also to the ACR clients 42A, 42B
and 42C.
 [0080]
The content renderer 41A acquires and branches all pieces
of content to be displayed in the window A on the screen
of the multi-window screen device 40 and supplies the
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                  34
pieces of content to the ACR client 42A.                       In particular,
the content renderer                      41A acquires and branches not only
content broadcast from the content server 21 but also
content inputted through various input terminals                           (HDMI
 (registered trademark) terminal and so forth) of the
multi-window screen device 40 and supplies the acquired
content to the ACR client 42A.                       This similarly applies
also to the content renderers 41B and 41C.
 [0081]
The ACR client 42A extracts, from content inputted
thereto from the content renderer 41A, signature data
representative of a characteristic of the content in a
predetermined                      sampling period.  Here, as the extraction
method of signature data, an extraction method same as
that used by the ACR server 24 of the provider system 20
 (hereinafter described) is used.
 [0082]
Further, the ACR client 42A generates an ACR query
including the extracted signature data and transmits the
ACR query to the ACR server 24 of the provider system 20
through the bidirectional communication network 12.
Further, the ACR client 42A receives and retains an ACR
response transmitted thereto from the ACR server 24 in
response to the ACR query transmitted therefrom.                           This
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                 35
similarly applies also to the ACR clients 42B and 42C.
 [0083]
The UPnP server 43 universally notifies an other device
 (in the present case, the second screen device 50),                      which
configures the home network system 30 together with the
multi-window screen device 40,                      of details of a WebAPI
 (Application Program Interface) adapted to call a
function of the multi-window screen device 40                       (in the
present case, to utilize the ACR service by the ACR
client 42)                     in which the UPnP server 43 itself is
incorporated.                      In particular, the UPnP server 43 newly
defines a protocol on a basic protocol provided by a
general UPnP server and uses the defined protocol to
carry out universal notification                      (hereinafter described
in detail).
 [0084]
The local Web server 44 allows an other device                       (in the
present case, the second screen device 50)                      which
configures the home network system 30 together with the
multi-window screen device 40 to utilize a function of
the multi-window screen device 40                      (in the present case,
in the present case, to utilize the ACR service by the
ACR client 42)                     in which the local Web server 44   itself is
incorporated.                      In particular, the local Web server 44
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                              36
controls the ACR client 42 in response to the fact that
the WebAPI let known from the UPnP server 43 is called to
utilize the ACR service, and transfers an ACR response
transmitted back from the ACR server 24 to the second
screen device 50.
 [0085]
The window manager 45 controls display of a frame of the
windows provided on the screen of the multi-window screen
device 40.
 [0086]
The second screen device 50 presents, in the present
embodiment, metadata of content being viewed principally
on the multi-window screen device 40 to the user or
executes a linked application in accordance with the
progression of the content.                   The second screen device 50
includes a plurality of ACR applications 51, linked
application managers 52, the number of which is equal to
the number of ACR applications 51, and a window manager
53.
 [0087]
In the present embodiment, it is assumed that the second
screen device 50 includes three ACR applications 51a, 51b
and 51c and three linked application managers 52a, 52b
and 52c.                   However, the number of them is not limited to
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                  37
three.               In the following description, where there is no
necessity to individually distinguish the ACR
applications 51a, 51b and 51c, each of them is referred
to merely as ACR application 51.                       This similarly applies
also to the linked application managers 52a, 52b and 52c.
 [0088]
The ACR application 51                      is installed in advance in the
second screen device 50 and is started up when the ACR
service is utilized in a linked relationship with the
multi-window screen device 40.                       The ACR application 51
acquires a WebAPI adapted to read out a function which
uses the ACR service from the UPnP server 43 and calls
the WebAPI to acquire an ACR response from the ACR server
24      received by the ACR client 42 through the local Web
server 44.                      Furthermore, the ACR application 51 analyzes
the acquired ACR response and notifies the linked
application manager 52 of a result of the analysis.
 [0089]
The linked application manager 52 presents, in accordance
with a notification from the ACR application 51,                      metadata
included in the ACR response to the user or acquires and
executes a linked application corresponding to the
content being viewed on the multi-window screen device 40
from the application server 23 through the bidirectional
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                  38
communication network 12.                       It is to be noted that a Web
browser can be used as the linked application manager 52.
 [0090]
The window manager 53 carries out setting, to the frame
which displays information                       (screen image of metadata or a
linked application) displayed by each of the linked
application managers 52, same as the setting of the frame
visual attribute of the window of the multi-window screen
device 40                    in which the corresponding content is displayed.
 [0091]
 [Example of Detailed Configuration of ACR Server 24]
FIG. 4 shows an example of a detailed configuration of
the ACR server 24 included in the provider system 20.
 [0092]
The ACR server 24 is configured from a content
acquisition section                      61,  a signature extraction  section 62,
an ACR database                      (DB) 63, an ACR response generation
section 64,                      and a communication section 65.
 [0093]
The content acquisition section 61 acquires content,
which the content server 21 is scheduled to broadcast
through the broadcasting network 11, or various pieces of
content, which can be viewed on the multi-window screen
device 40,                     from the content server 21 or the like and
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                   39
supplies the acquired content to the signature extraction
section 62.                        The signature extraction section 62 extracts,
from the content supplied thereto from the content
acquisition section 61, signature data representative of
a characteristic of the content in a predetermined
sampling period using a predetermined extraction method
and outputs the signature data to the ACR database 63.
 [0094]
To the extraction method of signature data by the
signature extraction section 62, an existing arbitrary
method can be applied.                        For example, a watermark embedded
in advance in content may be extracted and used as
signature data, or a fingerprint may be calculated and
used as signature data.
 [0095]
If a fingerprint is used as signature data, then even if
the resolution, aspect ratio, bit rate, encoding format
or the like of content is converted, the same signature
data can be obtained before and after the conversion.
Accordingly, the identification accuracy when
identification of content is carried out based on the
signature data can be enhanced.
 [0096]
It is to be noted that, where a plurality of ACR servers
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                40
24 are involved, the same extraction method of signature
data by the signature extraction section 62 need not be
used by the individual ACR servers 24,                    but an arbitrary
extraction method can be adopted for each of the ACR
servers                24.
 [0097]
The ACR database                   63 generates and stores ACR reference
data in which a content identifier or the like
representative of a piece of content of an extraction
source from which each signature data is extracted is
associated with each signature data inputted from the
signature extraction section 62.                     Consequently, the
signature data extracted from the content are converted
into a database.                    The data structure of ACR reference data
is hereinafter described with reference to FIG. 4.
 [0098]
The ACR response generation section 64 refers to the ACR
database                  63 to identify a piece of content of an
extraction source of                    signature data included in an ACR
query transmitted thereto from the ACR client 42.                      Further,
the ACR response generation section 64 generates an ACR
response which includes the content identifier as a
result of the identification, associated metadata and so
forth.               The data structure of the ACR response is
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                    41
hereinafter described with reference to FIG. 8.                          The
communication section 65 receives an ACR query
transmitted thereto from the ACR client 42 and outputs
the ACR query to the ACR response generation section 64,
and transmits an ACR response generated by the ACR
response generation section 64 to the ACR client 42.
 [0099]
 [Example of Detailed Configuration of ACR Client 42]
FIG. 5 shows an example of a detailed configuration of
the ACR client 42                        incorporated in the multi-window screen
device 40.
 [0100]
The ACR client 42                        is configured from a signature
extraction                     section    71, an ACR query  generation  section 72,
a communication section 73,                        and an ACR response retention
section 74.
 [0101]
The signature extraction section 71 extracts,                         from
content branched and supplied from the content renderer
41,        signature data representative of a characteristic of
the content in a predetermined sampling period and
outputs the signature data to the ACR query generation
section 72.                        It is to be noted that the extraction method
of signature data by the signature extraction section 71
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                 42
is common to that by the signature extraction section 62
of the ACR server 24 to be utilized.
 [0102]
The ACR query generation section 72 generates an ACR
query which includes                     signature data extracted by the
signature extraction section 71 and is used to request
the ACR server 24 to identify content.                       The data structure
of the ACR query is hereinafter described with reference
to FIG. 7.
 [0103]
The communication section 73 transmits an ACR query
generated by the ACR query generation section 72 to the
ACR server 24,                     receives an ACR response transmitted
thereto from the ACR server 24 and outputs the received
ACR response to the ACR response retention section 74.
The ACR response retention section 74                      retains the ACR
response received by the communication section 73.                        It is
to be noted that the retained ACR response is transferred
to the second screen device                      50 by the local Web server    44.
 [0104]
 [Data Structure of ACR Reference Data]
FIG. 6 illustrates a data structure of ACR reference data
formed as a database in the ACR database                       63 of the ACR
server 24.
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                    43
 [0105]
In ACR reference data 100, a content identifier 102,
reproduction time 103 and related metadata 104 are
associated with each signature data 101 extracted in a
predetermined cycle from content.
 [0106]
The signature data 101 is extracted from content by the
signature extraction section 62.          The content identifier
102        is information representative of a piece of content
of an extraction source of the signature data 101.           The
reproduction time 103 indicates progression timing of a
piece of content represented by the content identifier
102        at a time at which the signature data 101 is
extracted from the content, and is represented, for
example, by an elapsed period of time from the top of the
piece of content.
 [0107]
The related metadata 104 includes metadata of a piece of
content represented by the content identifier 102, a
linked application identifier          (information uniquely
representing a linked application to be executed in
accordance with the progression timing of a piece of
content indicated by the reproduction time 103) and
various data to be utilized by the executed linked
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                 44
application.
 [0108]
It      is to be noted that the related metadata 104 may have
contents which differ depending upon the progression
timing of a piece of content indicated by the
reproduction time 103.
 [0109]
 [Data Structure of ACR Query]
FIG. 7 illustrates a data structure of an ACR query
generated by the ACR query generation section 72 of the
ACR client 42.
 [0110]
An ACR query 110 includes an ACR query identifier 111,                      a
signature type identifier 112, a service identifier 113,
signature data 114,                     a local timestamp 115, a source
address 116 and a signature 117.
 [0111]
The ACR query identifier 111 is information used to
uniquely specify the ACR query 110.                      The signature type
identifier 112 is information used to specify an
extraction method used when the signature data 114 is
extracted.                      The service identifier 113 is information used
to select, where a plurality of ACR servers 24 exist, one
of the ACR servers 24 to which the ACR query 110 is to be
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                 45
transmitted to obtain an ACR response.
 [0112]
The signature data 114                     is extracted from content by the
signature extraction section 71 of the ACR client 42.                       The
local timestamp 115 indicates a timing at which the
signature data 114                    is extracted from the content and is
represented by time indicated by a local system clock of
the multi-window screen device 40.
 [0113]
The         source address            116 is an address of the ACR client     42,
which originates the ACR query 110, in the bidirectional
communication network 12,                     and is utilized as information
representative of a transmission designation of an ACR
response generated by the ACR server 24                      in response to
the ACR query 110.                     The  signature 117  suppresses
falsification of the ACR query 110.                       It is to be noted
that the ACR query 110 may be transmitted after it is
encoded fully.
 [0114]
 [Data Structure of ACR Response]
FIG. 8 illustrates data structures of an ACR response
generated by the ACR response generation section 64.
 [0115]
An ACR response                    120 has a data structure illustrated in A
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                        46
or B of FIG. 8.                           A of FIG. 8 illustrates a data structure
of the ACR response 120 in the case where a piece of
content of an extraction source of the signature data 114
included in the ACR query 110 is identified successfully,
namely, in the case where the user of the multi-window
screen device 40                           successfully identifies the piece of
content being viewed.                            B of FIG. 8 illustrates a data
structure of the ACR response 120 in the case where the
piece of content is not identified successfully.
 [0116]
In the ACR response 120                            (A of FIG. 8)   in the case where
the user of the multi-window screen device 40
successfully                       identifies      the  piece  of  content being viewed,
an ACR query identifier 121,                             a signature type identifier
122,         a service identifier 123, a content identifier 124,
a reproduction time 125,                            a local timestamp 126,    related
metadata 127,                        a source address      128 and a signature 129
are included.
 [0117]
Meanwhile, in the ACR response                             120  (B of FIG. 8) in the
case where the user of the multi-window screen device 40
does not successfully identify the piece of content being
viewed, the ACR query identifier 121, the service
identifier 122, the source address 128,                              the signature 129
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                47
and an identification failure flag 130 are included.
 [0118]
The ACR query identifier 121,                     signature type identifier
122,         service identifier 123 and local timestamp 126 are
used to specify the ACR query 110 which requests
transmission of the ACR response 120, and the ACR query
identifier 111,                    signature type identifier 112,   service
identifier 113 and local timestamp 115 of the ACR query
110 are cited and described.
 [0119]
The content identifier 124,                    reproduction time 125 and
related metadata 127 represent a result of identification
of content, and the content identifier 102,                      reproduction
time 103 and related metadata 104                     of the corresponding
ACR reference data 100 are cited and described.
 [0120]
The         source address            128 is an address of the ACR server 24,
which transmits the ACR response 120,                     in the
bidirectional communication network 12.                      The signature 129
is used to suppress falsification of the ACR response 120.
It      is to be noted that the ACR response 120 may be
entirely encrypted and transmitted to prevent
falsification thereof.
 [0121]
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                         48
The identification failure flag 130 is a flag
representing failure by the ACR server 24 in
identification of a piece of content of an extraction
source of the signature data 114             included in the ACR
query 110 from the ACR client 42,             namely, of a piece of
content being viewed by the user of the multi-window
screen device 40.
 [0122]
 [Process of Home Network System 30 of ACR Service
Utilization System 101
Now, two different processes when the second screen
device 50 in the home network system 30 acquires a device
description which is information relating to functions
which can be utilized by the multi-window screen device
40 are described.
 [0123]
It      is to be noted that the functions which can be
utilized by the multi-window screen device 40 in the
present embodiment indicate utilization of the ACR
service by the ACR client 42 and application of a frame
visual attribute to each window on the screen by the
window manager 45.
 [0124]
FIG. 9 is a flow chart             illustrating processing in the
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                49
case where, in a state in which the ACR application 51 is
started up already in the second screen device 50,                    the
multi-window screen device 40 is connected to the network
system 30                    (including also the timing at which the multi
window screen device 40 is started up).
 [0125]
At step Sl, the UPnP server 43 of the multi-window screen
device 40 multicast distributes a Notify message defined
by the UPnP given below to the home network system 30.
The Notify message is transferred to the home network
system 30 using a UDP/IP and received, in the present
case, by the ACR application 51 of the second screen
device 50.
 [0126]
NOTIFY * HTTP/1.1
LOCATION "http://192.168.0.4:55500"
 [0127]
In the LOCATION header of the Notify message, an
acquisition destination address of a device description
of the multi-window screen device 40 is described.
Therefore, at step Sl,                     the ACR application 51 of the
second screen device 50 acquires the device description
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                        50
from the                  acquisition      destination       address using a HTTP GET.
 [0128]
By the process described above, the ACR application 51 of
the second screen device 50                            can acquire the device
description of the multi-window screen device 40.
 [0129]
FIG. 10                is a flow chart illustrating a process when the
ACR application 51 is started up in the second screen
device 50 later in a state in which the multi-window
screen device 40 has already been connected to the
network system 30 and started up.
 [0130]
In this instance, since multicast distribution of the
Notify message by the UPnP server 43 of the multi-window
screen device 40 has been carried out already, the ACR
application 51 of the second screen device 50 cannot
receive the Notify message.                             Therefore, at step S21, the
ACR application 51 searches ACR clients which can be
utilized by an M-Search defined by the UPnP.
 [0131]
The UPnP server 43 of the multi-window screen device 40
responding to the M-Search answers the device description
at step S31.                       The ACR application 51 receives the device
description at step S22.

                                                 51
 [0132]
By the process described above, the ACR application 51 of
the second screen device 50                     can acquire the device
description of the multi-window screen device 40.

It      is to be noted that,            in a <SCPDURL> element of a
device             description     prescribed   in  an existing  general  UPnP,
an acquisition destination address of a service
description described in regard to ACR services which can
be utilized by the ACR client 42                    is described, and the
ACR application 51 acquires the service description from
the acquisition destination address using the HTTP GET.
Further, the ACR application 51                    sends a message of an
action to a URL described in a <controlURL> element using
a SOAP prescribed in the UPnP to call the action                     (in the
present case, transmission of an ACR query and transfer
of an ACR response).
 [0137]
However, in the present embodiment, in order to make it
possible to call an action by a reduced number of steps,
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                 53
such a device description prescribed in the UPnP as
described above is expanded such that the WebAPI adapted
to call the action is described directly in the device
description.
 [0138]
In particular, as in the case of the first example
described hereinabove, for example, the <SCPDURL> element
is left empty with nothing described therein, or else a
predetermined dummy character string is described in the
<SCPDURL> element while a server side script URL                  (in the
case of the first example,
http://192.168.0.4:55500/getACRResponse) of the WebAPI
adapted to start up the ACR client and request transfer
of the ACR response 120 is described directly in the
<controlURL> element.
 [0139]
Further, a <WindowStyle> element which is not described
in the UPnP is provided newly such that a server side
script URL                     (in the case of the first example,
http://192.168.0.4:55500/widowStyle) of the WebAPI
adapted to notify the window manager 45 of a frame visual
attribute or change the frame visual attribute is
described directly in the <WindowStyle> element.

                                                 54
It      is to be noted that a <service> element is described
for each of the installed                     ACR clients 42.  Accordingly, in
the case of the present embodiment, three <service>
elements are described in a <serviceList>.
 [0141]
Alternatively, a <WebAPIURL> element which is not
prescribed by the UPnP may be provided newly such that a
server side script URL of the WebAPI is described
directly in the <WebAPIURL> element as in the case of a
second example described below.

 [0143]
The ACR application 51 of the second screen device 50
which has acquired the device description of the first or
second example can cause an action to be executed by
calling the getACRResponse which is the server side
script url of the WebAPI described in the <controlURL>
element or the <WebAPIURL> element of the device
description using the HTTP GET.
 [0144]
In particular, it is possible to start up,           if the ACR
client 42 of the multi-window screen device 40 is not
started up as yet, the ACR client 42,           cause the ACR
client 42 to transmit the ACR query 110, and transfer the
ACR response 120 sent back in response to the ACR query
110.           It is to be noted that the transfer of the ACR
response 120 is carried out in a state in which it is
described in the body of an HTTP response returned in
response to the WebAPI, for example, in the following
manner using a JSON.
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                  56
 [0145]
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type:                      application/json;  charset=utf-8
"Contents of ACR response encoded by JSON"
 [0146]
A transaction which uses the WebAPI is carried out by
repetitive polling while content is being viewed.                         Then,
in response to the progression of the content, the
related metadata 127 and so forth in the ACR response 120
converted currently are presented to the user through the
second screen device 50.
 [0147]
If the device description is expanded and standardized as
described above, then the multi-window screen device 40
and the second screen device 50 which are                        fabricated and
sold by different vendors can rapidly operate in a linked
relationship with each other.
 [0148]
It      is to be noted that,                 a WebSocket whose standardization
is formulated by the IETF                       (Internet Engineering Task
Force) and so forth may be used in place of use of the
WebAPI.                 Where the WebSocket       is  used, a WebSocket  server
is provided in the local Web server 44                        (or the ACR client
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                       57
42 or           second screen device 50)  such that a session (TCP
connection) establishment request is issued from both of
the ACR application 51 and the ACR client 42 through the
WebSocket server to establish a session and the ACR
response 120 is transferred on the session using the JSON
described hereinabove or the like.
 [0149]
In this instance, if the ACR client 42 receives a new ACR
response 120 from the ACR server 24,            then the ACR
response 120 is transferred immediately to the ACR
application 51 through the established session.
Accordingly, the necessity for polling which is
necessitated where the WebAPI is used is eliminated, and
immediate transfer of the ACR response 120 which does not
rely upon the period of polling becomes possible.
 [0150]
Further, the ACR application 51 can acquire a frame
visual attribute of a window provided on the screen of
the multi-window screen device 40 from the window manager
45 through the local Web server 44 by calling a
windowStyle, which is the server side script url of the
WebAPI described in the <WindowStyle> element of the
device description by the HTTP GET.
 [0151]
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                             58
In particular, a frame visual attribute is described in
the body of an HTTP response returned in response to the
WebAIP.                 For example, if a color is set as a frame visual
attribute, then
border-color:#ffa000                ->  example of designating an orange
border color
is described in the body of the HTTP response.
 [0152]
It      is to be noted that,            if the frame visual attribute
returned from the multi-window screen device 40-1 and the
frame visual attribute returned from the multi-window
screen device 40-2 overlap with each other, then it is
possible to request one of the multi-window screen
devices 40-1 and 40-2 to change the frame visual
attribute.
 [0153]
In particular, a frame visual attribute into which the
frame visual attribute is to be changed may be described
into the body of a request by a HTTP POST request to the
URL of the WebAPI of the <WindowStyle> element.                  The
following example indicates a case in which an
overlapping frame visual attribute is changed to                  (border
color:#ffaOO1).
POST /windowStyle HTTP/1.0

 [0154]
 [Operation by ACR Service Utilization System 101
Now, operation of the ACR service utilization                      system 10
is described.
 [0155]
It      is to be noted that,                as a prerequisite of operation
described below, it is assumed that, in the home network
system 30,                     the ACR application 51 of the second screen
device 50 has already acquired a device description from
the UPnP server 43 of the multi-window screen device 40.
 [0156]
Further, it is assumed that,                      in the ACR server 24 of the
provider system 20, ACR reference data 100 corresponding
to various pieces of content which can be viewed on the
multi-window screen device 40 have been generated and are
registered in the ACR database                      63.
 [0157]
FIG. 11                is a flow chart illustrating operation of the ACR
service utilization system 10.
 [0158]
At step S41, the content server 21 of the provider system
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                       60
20 starts transmission of content through the
broadcasting network 11.
 [0159]
On the other hand, in the home network system 30, the
multi-window screen device 40 starts reception and
reproduction of the content at step S51.            Here, if  the ACR
application 51 of the second screen device 50 calls the
WebAPI which requests startup of the ACR client 42 and
transfer of an ACR response at step S61, then the ACR
client 42 and so forth start operation under the control
of the local Web server 44 in response to the WebAPI.
 [0160]
In particular, if the ACR client 42 of the multi-window
screen device 40 receives supply of a piece of content
which is being viewed from the content renderer 41, then
the signature extraction section 71 extracts the
signature data 114 from the piece of content and outputs
the signature data 114 to the ACR query generation
section 72 at step S52.            At step S53, the ACR query
generation section 72 generates an ACR query 110 which
includes the signature data 114, and the communication
section 73 transmits the generated ACR query 110 to the
ACR server 24.
 [0161]
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                   61
In the ACR server 24 which receives the ACR query 110
from the ACR client 42, the ACR response generation
section 64 refers to the ACR database 63 to identify a
piece of content corresponding to the signature data 114
included in the received ACR query 110 at step S42.
Further, the ACR response generation section 64 generates
an ACR response 120 in response to a result of the
identification of the piece of content and the
communication section 65 transmits the generated ACR
response 120 to the ACR client 42 at step S43.
 [0162]
The ACR client 42 which receives the ACR response 120
from the ACR server 24 supplies the received ACR response
120 to the local Web server 44 at step S54.  The local Web
server 44 transfers the ACR response 120 to the ACR
application 51 of the second screen device 50.
 [0163]
In the ACR application 51 which receives the ACR response
120 transferred thereto, the ACR application 51 of the
second screen device 50 calls the WebAPI used to request
notification of a frame visual attribute at step S62.  In
response to this, the local Web server 44 notifies the
ACR application 51 of the frame visual attribute managed
by the window manager 45 at step S55.
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                           62
 [0164]
The ACR application 51 which receives the notification of
the frame visual attribute notifies the window manager 53
of the             frame visual             attribute.         The window manager   53
confirms whether or not the received frame visual
attribute overlaps with the frame visual attribute
notified already from an other multi-window screen device
40.          If an overlapping is detected, then the ACR
application 51 requests change of the frame visual
attribute by an HTTP POST request.                                  The request is
transmitted from the local Web server 44 to the window
manager 45 at step S56.                              If the window manager 45      changes
the         frame           visual    attribute         in    accordance  with the  request,
then the frame visual attribute after the change is
conveyed as a notification                              from the local Web server 44
to the ACR application 51.                               The ACR application 51 which
receives the frame visual attribute after the change
notifies the window manager 53 of the frame visual
attribute                   after   the change at step S64.              The window
manager 53                     sets the frame visual attribute of a screen
image of a linked application to be displayed thereafter
and the like based on the frame visual attribute after
the change.
 [0165]
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                63
It is to be noted that, if it is confirmed at step S62
that the frame visual attribute does not overlap, then a
change of the frame visual attribute is not requested,
and the process at step S64 is executed.
 [0166]
Further, the processes at steps S62 to S64 may be
executed immediately after the process at step S61
without waiting for the process at step S54                     (transfer of
an ACR response).
 [0167]
At step S65, the ACR application 51 analyzes the related
metadata 127 included in the ACR response 120 transferred
thereto and causes the linked application manager 52 to
acquire a linked application to be executed in conformity
with the progression of the piece of content being viewed.
 [0168]
At step S66, the linked application manager 52 acquires
and executes the linked application supplied by the
process at step S44 by the application server 23.                     It is
to be noted that, if the linked application has been
acquired already, then the acquisition can be omitted.
Further, if the linked application has already been
started up, then the startup of the linked application
can be omitted.                    Furthermore,  information included in  the
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                   64
related metadata 127 is sometimes presented to the user
without involving execution of the linked application.
 [0169]
At this time, the frame of the screen image of the linked
application presented to the user has the frame visual
attribute made coincident, by the window manager 53, with
the frame visual attribute of the frame of the window in
which the corresponding piece of content is displayed on
the multi-window screen device 40.
 [0170]
The processes at steps S41 to S44, processes at steps S51
to S56 and processes at steps S61 to 66 described above
are executed repetitively while the content is viewed.
However, it is possible to omit the repetitions or reduce
the frequency in execution of the processes at steps S61
to S66 and the processes at steps S55 and S56.
 [0171]
Consequently, the second screen device 50 can operate the
linked application in accordance with the progression of
a piece of content being viewed on the multi-window
screen device 40 by the user.
 [0172]
Further, the user can quickly grasp to which one of
pieces of content displayed on the multi-window screen
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                   65
device 40 the screen image presented to the user by the
second screen device 50 corresponds.
 [0173]
Incidentally, while it is possible to configure the
servers                from the content server 21 to ACR server 24 of
the provider system 20 and the multi-window screen device
40 and second screen device 50 of the home network system
30,       which execute the series of processes described above
individually by hardware, they may otherwise be
implemented by a computer executing software.                             This
computer includes a computer incorporated in hardware for
exclusive use, a personal computer,                         for example, for
universal use which can execute various functions by
installing various programs, and so forth.
 [0174]
FIG. 12                is a block diagram showing an example of a
hardware configuration of the computer described above.
 [0175]
In a computer 200,                        a CPU (Central Processing Unit) 201, a
ROM (Read Only Memory) 202 and a RAM                         (Random Access
Memory) 203 are connected to one another by a bus 204.
 [0176]
Further, an input/output interface 205 is connected to
the bus                204.        An inputting  section  206,  an outputting
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                  66
section 207, a storage section 208, a communication
section 209 and a drive 220 are connected to the
input/output interface 205.
 [0177]
The inputting section 206 is configured from a keyboard,
a mouse,                 a microphone and so forth.        The outputting
section 207 is configured from a display unit, a speaker
and so forth.                      The storage section 208 is configured from
a hard disk, a nonvolatile memory or the like.                        The
communication section 209 is configured from a network
interface and so forth.                      The drive 220 drives a removable
medium 211 such as a magnetic disk, an optical disk, a
magneto-optical disk, and a semiconductor memory.
 [0178]
In the computer 200 configured in such a manner as
described above, the CPU 201 loads a program stored, for
example, in the storage section 208 into the RAM 203
through the input/output interface 205 and the bus 204
and executes the program to carry out the series of
processes described above.
 [0179]
The program to be executed by the computer 200                        (CPU 201)
can be recorded on and provided as the removable medium
211 as a package medium,                      for example.   Further, the
10047499_1 (GHMatters) P97489.AU.1

                                                   67
program can be provided through a wire or wireless
transmission medium such as a local area network, the
Internet or a digital satellite broadcast.
 [0180]
In the computer 200,                       the program can be installed into
the storage section 208 through the input/output
interface 205 by loading the removable medium 211 into
the drive 220.                       Further, the program can be received by
the communication section 209 through a wire or wireless
transmission medium and installed into the storage
section 208.                       Otherwise, the program can be installed in
advance in the ROM 202 or the storage section 208.
 [0181]
It      is to be noted that the program to be executed by the
computer 200 may be a program by which the processes are
carried out in a time series in the order as described in
the present specification or a program by which the
processes are executed in parallel or at necessary
timings such as when the processes are called.
 [0182]
It      is to be noted that the embodiment of the present
disclosure is not                       limited to the specific embodiment
described hereinabove but can be changed in various
