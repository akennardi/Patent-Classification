             Automated Voice-to-Reporting/ Management System and Method for
                                 Voice Call-ins of Events/Crimes
                                                 ABSTRACT
        A system for institutions (particularly public safety) to accept spoken information such
that users can report incident details as required to convey an official incident (e.g., crime) report
and to aid in the investigation of the incident. Similarly, users can employ a combination of
voice or text input, media submission, [GUI menu screens] and information download to aid in
the im-mediate analysis of incident information to facilitate a rapid response for the incident.
This method of interaction with institutions enables reporting parties to more quickly and
efficiently convey incident information when direct interaction by an official is not possible or is
subject to delay. This helps institutions, for example, police to provide better services while
using less staff and resources.

PCT/US2013/028377, filed on 28 February 2013. International Patent Application No.
PCT/US2013/028377 claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 61/604,196,
filed February 28, 2012 and 61/658,641 filed June 12, 2012, both titled "Automated Voice-to

No. 2013225884 is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
            Field
[0002]      This invention relates to managing voice call-ins. More particularly, the invention
relates to computer-aided management of processing/reporting of voice call-ins in official
reporting scenarios.
            Background
[0003]      Public safety institutions (local, State and Federal) are mandated to provide services
to victims of crime as well as a continuance of crime prevention activities. Responsibility for
these service commitments, including responding to emergencies, are usually assigned to a
limited collection of trained officers and officials. When criminal acts occur, these officials must
constantly evaluate the incident priority and deploy resources based upon the level of emergency
and the potential for suspect apprehension.
[0004]      Due to a higher demand than capacity, the response to lower priority criminal
incidents is regularly delayed or neglected indefinitely. This causes degraded service levels,
higher crime rates in certain categories and a continual strain on the limited number of officers
who are available. As an alternative, some institutions employ representatives who possess a
lower level of training that may respond to the incident location, or provide services via a call
center. These methods still require staffing of qualified individuals and the associated cost of
employment. While reducing the burden on the "officials," a significant

amount of manpower and the attendant costs are still required under the current
response paradigm.
[0005]      In view of the above, more efficient/effective methods and systems to
responding/managing call-ins for emergency or other related events are needed.
Methods and systems which address these and other deficiencies in the above
stated paradigm are elucidated in the following description.
                                     SUMMARY
[0006]      The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a
basic understanding of some aspects of the claimed subject matter. This
summary is not an extensive overview, and is not intended to identify
key/critical elements or to delineate the scope of the claimed subject matter. Its
purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more
detailed description that is presented later.

WO 2013/130847                                                                 PCT/US2013/028377
                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
        [0031]      In various exemplary embodiments described below, methods and
        systems for the computerized acceptance of spoken information for
        crime/emergency/event reporting are presented. Generally speaking, effective
        service to reporting parties can be provided with a computerized interaction that
        uses audio and visual interfaces with structured automation to effectively prompt
        for information, capture relevant responses and complete as-needed reports)
        without the need for immediate involvement by an official. In various
        embodiments, the exemplary system will utilize computerized displays;
        computerized vocalizations; decision logic that validates completeness, as well
        as identify duplicate reports and highlight key words or phrases; commencement
        of outbound voice communications; selection of pre-defined responses for the
        reporting party; enablement of reporting party to complete follow-up actions for
        the same incident or prohibit further manipulation of the report. As will be
        detailed below, automation of the report generation aspects of the exemplary
        embodiments provides, among other aspects, significant savings in manpower,
        time and costs while enhancing service-levels. While the examples below may
        be described for victims of lesser crimes, it is understood that the exemplary
        embodiments may be applied to the reporting of other crime/emergency/event
        situations.
        [0032]      FIG. 1 is an illustration of a prior art, reporting/response process for a
        crime (e.g., robbery) scenario having an Institution 180 and Reporting Party
        (RP) 182. Incident 181 describes the flow between Institution 180 and RP 182.
        When an event 100 (for example, Robbery) occurs and the victim RP 182
        discovers it 110, he calls 120 the Institution 180, which is received by a
        Dispatcher 121. After 130 providing the details to the Dispatcher 121, the call is
        terminated 131 by the RP 182. A period of delay 133 occurs at the Institution
        180, whereupon officers are sent 135 to the scene, to investigate, gather facts
        137 from the RP 182. After 140 the facts are gathered, a report is manually
        generated 141 by officers and/or personnel at the Institution 180. After another
        period of delay 143, the report is reviewed by supervisors 145 and after 150
        review, the report is "approved/completed" 151. The completed report 151 is
        then forwarded 160 to the RP 182 who eventually receives 161 the completed
                                                    5

report 151.   As is apparent, there are many delays in the prior art approach, as
well as the significant dedication of several levels of manpower to ultimately
generate a report.
[0033]      FIG. 2 is an illustration of an exemplary reporting/response system
applied to the scenario of FIG. 1. Similar to FIG. 1, an incident (shown in this
example as a robbery) 200 occurs and similar steps between the RP 282 and the
Institution 280 occur for the initial call 220. However, upon determination by
the Dispatcher 221, an exemplary reporting system is implemented to expedite
many of the steps performed in FIG. 1. For example, the exemplary reporting
system is engaged 230 by Dispatcher 221, to transfer 231 the queries with the
RP 282 to be automatic 237, as interfaced by System Processing module 400.
System Processing module 400 forwards the responses to be transcribed to
Transcription module 247 which is then converted into a report by Report
Output module 250. In some embodiments, a measure of transcription certainty
is retained for the Report Output module 250. Report Output module 250
forwards 260 (automatically, if needed) to the "officials" or supervisors 252 in
or associated with Institution 280, who then update 261, if necessary, the report.
The updating may simply be approval or requests for more information, or the
addition of information. The exemplary reporting system then forwards 270 a
copy of the finalized report to the RP 271.
[0034]      In various embodiments, the exemplary reporting system may have a
voice application(s) as part of the System Processing module 400 which interacts
with the RP 282 to collect appropriate details which are forwarded to
Transcription module 247. The exemplary reporting system is understood to be
automated, however, in some instances human-assisted transcription services
may be relied upon for the Report Output module 250. Accordingly, in some
instances, a portion or entirety of the transcription can be off-loaded to human
transcription service (not shown). In some instances, the human transcription
service may simply operate to error check or validate the results of Transcription
Module 247. For example, text or grammar checking could be performed in
Transcription Module 247 and an error flag could be set which would send the
error-tagged portion with the corresponding voice recording portion to the
human transcription service. Of course, in some implementations (as a non
                                            6

limiting example, a high priority call) the entirety or a large portion of the actual
voice recording may be transcribed by the human transcription service.
[0035]       Upon transcription, various forms of error checking (as a non
limiting example, correlating a reported address in the transcription with the
actual address of the caller) or some other quality control measure may be
executed, if so desired. Further, the Report Output Module 250 can also be
forwarded to officials who may yet respond, those that have been "on-site" or
officials that are familiar with the situation at hand for additional input or
correction, by either the exemplary reporting system or by the RP 282.
[0036]       Upon satisfaction of the report details, the RP 282 can bring closure
to the call-in scenario by, as a non-limiting example, making a payment, if this is
an insurance related claim, or sending officials to the site, if the report indicates
that officials should visit the site/caller (if they have not already). Of course,
other responses are possible, the above examples just describing a few of many
possible resolution scenarios.
[0037]       It should be apparent that the above exemplary paradigm is not
limited to solely crime reporting, but can also be applied to other situations
where an event or details of an event are documented for review and approval.
For example, in the event of a post natural catastrophe, the harmed party could
orally detail the circumstances/facts of their loss to their insurance company and
the exemplary reporting system could be used to assist in claim assessment and
reporting. Due to "sensitivities" of the exemplary reporting system to key words
or phrases that are germane to assessing the seriousness or urgency of the
caller's need, the exemplary reporting system can be designed to be flexible
enough to provide personalized service (e.g., switch to a human, or official in the
vicinity) when needed.
[0038]       With automated reporting, and recognizing the capabilities provided
by such, the on-site agent/official could be afforded the benefit of receiving a
pre-report (e.g., detailing the caller's facts) perhaps, even en route to the caller's
site. Other possible non-limiting examples are for medical services or
emergencies, where a request for an ambulance could be vetted in a similar way,
to determine if the need for the ambulance is genuine or a non-emergency. Also,
prior to arrival of the medical technicians to the caller's residence, some form of
                                             7

documentation from the exemplary reporting system could be forwarded to the
medical technician, to assist, if needed, the treatment and handling of the patient.
Significant time savings can be obtained if an automatic reporting system, as
described, is utilized in the emergency field. For example, the prior art
Dispatcher typically fields the entire call before relaying information to
emergency personnel, which carries a large delay in time. If the secondary
details can be offloaded to an exemplary reporting system, the Dispatcher can
immediately inform the necessary emergency personnel to begin their travel to
the emergency site.
[0039]      Further, with the capability to provide voice-to-report, the exemplary
reporting system may be used by the officials themselves, as a means for
"adding" to the report. That is, in some embodiments, the official may "call in"
and dictate into the exemplary reporting system to assist in formulating the facts
for the end report. Accordingly, while the voice-to-report conversion process is
initially described for benefiting the "first" communication, it may be applied to
subsequent sessions - by the "victim" and/or by the official(s).
[0040]      FIG. 19 is a block diagram illustration showing possible supporting
architecture(s) for an exemplary reporting system. The exemplary reporting
system 370 communicates to various Institutions 300 and Device(s) 350, via
connections (maybe secure, for example, HTTPS) 309, 317, web service
connection 313 and voice connection 319. The Institutions 300 can be a
compendium of "external" systems which can contain a Computer Aided
Dispatch (CAD) system 301, Records Management System (RMS) 303, and
emergency public-safety access point system (aka 911 service) 305, as well as
other systems 306 that may be institutional or not. In a crime based scenario, the
RMS 303 will commonly be the official repository of crime reports. The
Institutions 300, depending on the call-in scenario, provide complementary
information and/or verification information concerning the reporting party. For
example, the caller's location based on 911 support.
[0041]      Devices 350 can contain a repertoire of various communication
devices including landlines 351, wireless 352, tablet computers 355,
computers/servers/etc. 357, cell phones or cell based communication devices
358, as well as other now or future derived communication devices 359.
                                           8

[0042]       The exemplary reporting system 370 contains a Voice-to-Reporting
Services engine 400, Voice Transcription Service(s) module 320 and
Connection/Web Service Manager module 330, shown here as being secure.
Due to different communication paradigms by different systems,
Connection/Web Service Manager module 330 is utilized to coordinate secure
and/or web-based digital communications between the various systems via
connections 309, 313 and 317, and forwarding such communications to Voice
to-Reporting Services engine 400 via link 316. Though not explicitly shown,
Connection/Web Service Manager module 330 can include secure data storage,
application provisioning, analysis tools and decision support logic.
[0043]       The Connection/Web Service Manager module 330 can provide
application or software provisioning onto one or more of the user's Devices 350
from the Reporting System 370 via link 317, or via external Application Sources
360 using communication links 312 and 314 using any means available, for
example, HTTP/Web, cellular, wi-fi, etc. The Connection/Web Service
Manager 330 can also initiate via link 317, for example, the launching of
applications on one or more of the Devices 350 upon the completion of
provisioning, along with loading of session specific application data associated
with the current report input session.
[0044]       Voice Transcription Service(s) module 320 communicates with
Voice-to- Voice-to-Reporting Services engine 400 via link 315. Voice
transcription for Voice Transcription Service(s) module 320 can be externally
facilitated by Voice Transcription Service 336 via external link 334. Voice
transcription can be accomplished using computerized speech recognition,
manual voice transcription services by another person, or some combination
thereof. Voice transcription via Voice Transcription Service(s) 336 (320) may
have a transcription mode selection capability, to dynamically select the optimal
method of transcription using criteria such as: transcription service costs, process
duration; transcription quality, current service performance levels, transcription
processing time, and the nature of the information being transcribed. Actual
voice call-ins from Device(s) 350 may be channeled, if so desired, directly to
Voice App Service 310 in the Voice-to-Reporting Services engine 400. Voice
to-Reporting Services engine 400 will also contain Reporting module 340, as
                                          9

well as other necessary modules 338. In some instances, a mode of Voice
Transcription Service(s) module 320 may augment its transcription capability by
spoken repetition of original responses by a secondary person whose voice is
directly linked to better-trained automated speech recognition services.
[0045]      The bi-directional nature of the various communication links
indicates that communication can also occur "from" the exemplary reporting
system 370. For example, Voice App Service 310 in the Voice-to-Reporting
Services engine 400 will have the capability to prompt/ask questions to a caller
(aka Device(s) 350), conceivably even with text messaging, if so configured.
Therefore, an interaction with caller can be via a computerized presentation and
reception of spoken dialog, if so configured.
[0046]      Also, information between CAD system 301, RMS 303, and
emergency public-safety access point system (aka 911 service) 305 can be
downloaded/uploaded, if so designed, allowing various offices in Institutions
300 to be updated with current information from the Voice-to-Reporting
Services engine 400. This process enables information about an incident to be
forwarded, by the Institution(s) 300, to responding officials in the event they
dispatched at some point after the reporting party has provided the initial input.
[0047]      As another example of information exchange, CAD 301 may
exchange data/information with "911" institutions 305, RMS 309, using
information stored in the exemplary voice-based reporting system 370. This
"integration" allows various institution(s) 300 to exchange incident-related
details captured during the initial dialog with the "911" caller, which can provide
context for each institutional element and also provide context during the
appropriate questioning sequence in the exemplary reporting system 370. For
example, the automatic number information (ANI), caller ID, automatic location
information (ALI), address of record, cellular coordinates, and so forth - as
originating from a 911 call) can be incorporated into the exemplary reporting
system 370 via actions/protocol management initiated by Connection/Web
Service Manager module 330, to eliminate the need to solicit this basic data
again from the caller. If the data is generated by the Institution(s) 300 in a web
based document/form, it can be polled by the Connection/Web Service Manager
                                          10

module 330, and the information forwarded to the exemplary reporting system
370.
[0048]       While this description contains FIGS. which show "modules" without
explicit hardware representations, it is understood by one of ordinary skill in the
art, that these are computer-based systems that inherently contain a combination
of computer-based hardware and transformative software processes, the
transformative processes being described herein. Also, while FIG. 19 illustrates
various architectural elements for use with an exemplary reporting system 370, it
should be appreciated that other architectural elements may be added or the
elements shown may be combined, distributed, layered, etc. according to design
preference. Accordingly, having understood the precepts behind the exemplary
reporting system 370, one of ordinary skill in the art may make various
modifications or changes thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of
this disclosure.
[0049]       FIG. 20 is another a block diagram illustration showing another
possible supporting architecture for an exemplary voice reporting system 370.
Generally speaking, integration with the Institution 300 and/or CAD systems is
shown to exchange other incident-related details captured during the initial
dialog with the reporting caller. That integration provides context for the
appropriate questioning sequence in the Voice App Service 310. It also
exemplifies Voice Transcription 320 by integration with external services. This
may include computerized speech recognition, manual voice transcription
services by another person, or some combination thereof. Information obtained
from the reporting party by the voice reporting system 370 will also be available
for transmission to the Institution's 300 CAD system or "911" system through a
web service 325. This process enables information about an incident to be
forwarded to responding officials via these systems in the event they are
dispatched at some point after the reporting party has provided the initial input.
[0050]       Specifically speaking, voice reporting system 370 contains three
principal systems: Voice App Service 310, Voice Transcription Service(s) 320
and Web Integration Service 330. All three principal systems have direct or
indirect communication channels to external systems such as Institution 300 and
caller devices (phone 358, wireless device 353, Tablet 355, PC/Mac 357, and
                                          11

Smartphone 359). Of course, other devices not listed herein may be used
according to design preference. Voice link 319 is used to connect any voice call
to Voice App Service 310, and information is gathered from the caller via
appropriate querying by the Voice App Service 310. "Web" link 323 is used to
connect the Web Integration Service 330 to "computer-like" devices such as the
Tablet 355, PC/Mac 357 and Smartphone 359, which provides web-like
interaction to gather non-voice information from the caller. For security
purposes, a HTTPS (or VPN or other secure) connection may be the connection
of choice when interfacing via web link 323.
[0051]       Information from either Voice App Service 310 and Web Integration
Service 330 is forwarded to Voice Transcription Service(s) 320 for conversion
into text. Information can also be obtained from Institution 300 for querying the
caller or information obtained from the caller can be forwarded to Institution 300
(for example, a 911 call is detected). Institution 300 and its resources may
contain data that assist in resolving the call-in. such as verification of address of
the call-in. Institution 300 is linked to exemplary reporting service 370 via a
network connection 325 such as HTTPS or a dedicated web services link
Coordination of the call-in queries by the exemplary reporting system 370 and
the automation capabilities provided by the various supporting systems result in
an efficient report generating paradigm that can be implemented with little to no
disruption to prior art call-in centers.
[0052]       FIG. 22 is an illustration of basic hardware elements in a computer
device/system 2200 suitable for use in the exemplary reporting system. The
computer system 2200 contains a main processor/CPU 2210 communicating
with discrete memory 2220 and/or hard drive memory 2230. The memories
2220, 2230 may be co-located with CPU 2210 (on same board) or on a separate
platform (e.g., RAID). Software running on CPU 2210 may be stored in CPU
2210 and/or on discrete memory 2220 and/or hard drive memory 2230, as well
as on removable media 2240. Data/Comm Bus 2260 provides communication
pathways between various hardware elements and also to external systems (not
shown) via path 2260. It is understood that FIG. 22 is a simple illustration,
showing basic components of a computer and that computers may vary in many
respects, according to design preference. For example, multiple CPUs, Buses,
                                            12

Memory may be utilized to increase performance, as well as specific hardware
chips, such as networking, graphic processors and so forth. Accordingly,
various modifications and changes may be made to computer system 2200 by
one of ordinary skill in the art, without departing from the spirit and scope of this
disclosure.
[0053]      As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present
disclosure and of computer system 2200, described in FIG. 22, may be embodied
as an apparatus that incorporates some software components. Accordingly,
some embodiments of the present disclosure, or portions thereof, may combine
one or more hardware components such as microprocessors, microcontrollers, or
digital sequential logic, etc., such as processor 2210 with one or more software
components (e.g., program code, firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.)
stored in a tangible computer-readable memory device such as memory 2220,
2230, that in combination form a specifically configured apparatus that performs
the functions as described herein. These combinations that form specially
programmed devices may be generally referred to herein "modules". The
software component portions of the modules may be written in any computer
language and may be a portion of a monolithic code base, or may be developed
in more discrete code portions such as is typical in object-oriented computer
languages. In addition, the modules may be distributed across a plurality of
computer platforms, servers, terminals, and the like. A given module may even
be implemented such that the described functions are performed by separate
processors and/or computing hardware platforms. In addition,
some embodiments of the apparatus may include a tangible computer readable
medium 2240 containing instructions stored therein that when executed by a
processing device cause the processing device to implement the methods as
described herein.
[0054]      FIG. 3 is an illustration of an exemplary process through various
system modules for managing an exemplary reporting system, as disclosed
herein, in the context of a Robbery Report. Supporting this organization of
system modules is one or more of the architectures described in FIG. 19-20,
whereas the architecture(s) can be supported by computer systems and
communication systems that are configured to provide the linkages and
                                           13

capabilities described herein. Layering the system modules as described herein,
provides for automation of various steps that were previously only possible
through human/manual interaction, as well as enhanced reporting capabilities,
while still providing appropriate levels of "control," as needed.
[0055]       The following description of FIG. 3 will be cursory, the details of
each system module being more fully explored in the ensuing FIGS. The
illustrated System Processing 400 organization is configured in a context that
mimics the operational nature of police services at a police station. Generally
speaking, the exemplary process for the example of a Robbery Report begins
with an Initialization module 500 that provides basic start-up/house-keeping
management. After initialization for Exception 520 handling, the Front Lobby
system module 600 engages and generally acts as salutations/initial caller
assessment, involving questions presented to the caller, as deemed appropriate.
The Front Lobby module 600 is the point of initial system contact with a
reporting party. Handshaking 610 and Triage 630 forward the call handling to
Report Input-Edit module 700 which obtains the details from the
victim/reporting party. The Report Input-Edit module 700 and Review/Output
module 800 serve as the service point for completing and obtaining a crime
report.
[0056]       The Report Room module 900 is isolated from citizens and is only
available to officials who, for example, review reports, request more information
or approve reports previously submitted, etc. The Exit module 1000 manages
subsequent actions depending upon the status of the session and reports.
[0057]       In Report Input-Edit module 700, subsequent to the collection of
Evidence 770, a Farewell action 690 is triggered and the process can invoke the
Review/Output module 800 or proceed to the Exit module 1000, where the case
facts/information/data is updated 1010 and Notification 1020 is made to the
appropriate individuals/organizations. Finally, Shredder module 1030 is invoked
to remove or encrypt the report data. Involvement of the other system and/or
sub-modules in the exemplary process is dependent upon the status of the current
event.
[0058]       FIG. 4 illustrates and exemplary process flow associated with
Initialization module 500 and its associated sub-modules (System/App Logic
                                         14

510, Exceptions 520) and components. The Initialization module 500 can be
used to automatically collect and prepare session specific data and parameters
that control the system logic, application logic, and session-specific handling of
exceptions. It may also determine what alternative modes of communication
available (if any), prepare the alternative modes of communication, and may
enable the transition to the alternate modes.
[0059]      For example, System/App Logic sub-module 510 determines System
Status Properties 512 to identify current availability of external Transcription
services 513, Interfaces to other systems 514 and Storage resources 515. System
Status Properties 512 can be periodically updated with the status of these sub
systems or updated upon polling. These property values are used during the
session to optimize or limit the questioning sequences. Likewise, Session
Properties 530 are captured here to further adapt the mode of communication
and the questioning sequence based upon knowledge of the user's Device 531
and Mode of communication 535, having discrimination levels 532-534 and
536-539, respectively. Other devices and other modes are possible beyond those
currently listed as alternatives become available.
[0060]      The Detect Device 531 and Set Modes 535 sub-modules include steps
to determine device capabilities and enable a transition to an alternate mode of
communication with the system. Once the alternative mode, if needed, is
established, or the original mode is selected, processing will continue with
utilization of the device and mode specific parameters. For example, this FIG.
depicts a system session that was initially established with a user with a landline
telephone device.
[0061]      Referring now to FIG. 21, for one non-limiting example of possible
processes/decisions in Detect Device 531 and Set Mode 535 sub-modules, when
a cell or web connection is detected.    Device Interrogation 2111 can be
performed and a Device Lookup 2112 to further determine characteristics and
capabilities of the user's device. Then Get Capability Options 2113 captures this
data and the system Selects Capability Options 2114 can be utilized to further
assess the capabilities of the device. Subsequent steps such as Device
Identification 2121, Device ID lookup 2122, Set Session Data 2123 and Set Opt
In Options 2124, individually or aggregately, may be invoked, the respective
                                          15

steps being descriptively self-evident. For example, whether the user is calling
in from a simple cell phone versus a smartphone can be determined via the
Detect Device sub-module 531. The associated data is then captured into the
session record.
[0062]       Continuing, the Get Agency Mode Options 2131 sub-module
establishes agency-specific controls on available modes, and is followed by a
Prompt for Desired Modes 2123. The user may select one or more available
modes and the Set Mode Change 2133 documents the selection. Upon the Check
Application Setup on Device 2134, the system may then Push Application &
Install 2141 a program on the selected device. Validate App Install 2142 will
determine if setup was successful; and if unsuccessful 2116, the session
Continues Initial Mode 2151. If Validate 2142 is successful, the User Opt-In
Prompt 2143 follows and records user preference for the session. If the user does
not Opt-In 2143, then Continue Initial Mode 2151 follows. Upon acceptance of
Opt-in 2143, Load Session Data 2144 transfer's session specific data to the
device via the alternative mode. Finally, the Run Application 2145 sub-module
initiates the alternate application on the device and the session continues with the
selected mode. For this example that alternate mode is Web 539 rather than the
initial mode Voice 536.
[0063]       A specific example of this process can be envisioned by a reporting
party being prompted or requesting for continuation (or even initiation) of the
report/call via an application that is either residing on his device or can be loaded
onto his device. That is, the device application can be used to continue with
processing the report at this stage. This option allows for users to use an
application (aka app) or other software appliance that may be tailored to their
device, allowing more efficient use of the hardware available. As one non
limiting example, a voice-controlled or voice-assistant application that utilizes a
smart-phone's voice recognition capabilities can be downloaded to better
replicate voice-to-text or text-to-voice questioning, or other automated
question/response interactions. Of note is the recent use of voice-assistant
applications that are resident on modern smart phones, smart devices. This
would allow the exemplary system to exploit a device capability of the user's
device to proxy the oral querying.
                                           16

[0064]       It should be understood that while the above FIGS. show the device
application being relegated to interrogation, mode selection and session-data
transfer, other capabilities that would benefit the exchange of
information/processing/report formulation are contemplated and are understood
to be within the spirit and scope of this disclosure.
[0065]       Returning now to FIG. 4, when the mode of communication is voice
536, the system will trigger Get Inbound Data sub-module 544 (versus Set
Outbound Call Info sub-module 540) to obtain Caller ID 544/Number called 548
and optional, Automatic Number Information and Automatic Location
Information (ANI/ALI) 545, or CAD information 546 is captured to reduce the
need for the reporting party to re-enter information that has previously been
determined. App & Security ID 547 is used for capturing a unique identification
code associated with the instance and version of the application being employed
for the current user-session. A unique security identification code (specified by
the user, or generated automatically during application install) may also be
captured at this point. These codes are captured into the session specific records
in order to enable user-specific authentication for subsequent sessions. It also
provides a method for linking session activity to a specific device and/or user.
[0066]       Further, a Match to Institution 550 is provided which dynamically
determines which institution this reporting party is served by. In all cases, there
are institution specific settings that can be set during initialization in the Set
Institution 551, which may be facilitated by checking for earlier reports 553,
[0067]       None/New/Closed, Followup/Edit, and Review operations 554, 555,
556, respectively, are available for action based on the result of Check Prior
Reports 553. Depending on the type of scenario this invention is applied to
situation (e.g., insurance claim), these institution specific settings may be
appropriately altered without departing from the sprit and scope of this
disclosure.
[0068]       For a None/New 554 status, and presuming there are no
exceptions/faults that are detected in System/App Logic system 510, the
exemplary process proceeds 563 to Front Lobby module 600 for appropriate
"front lobby" processing which, in this example, entails general "handshaking."
                                           17

[0069]       Also illustrated as part of the Initialization module 500, Exceptions
sub-module 520 initializes the exception-handling for various scenarios
including: No Institution Match 521 and Key Word Hit 524. Key Word Hit 524
establishes how the system processes each occurrence of a pre-determined key
word in the input from the reporting party. For example, if the word "shotgun" is
received at any time during the session, an alert message can be immediately
sent to an official and the exemplary process Transfers Request 525 to the
appropriate party and Hangs up 526 with a subsequent System Down 527 or
restart. Other parameters can be initialized that determine institution-specific
handling of incomplete sessions, interrupted communications, and routing
numbers for call-transfers.
[0070]       Additional capabilities such as Identify/PIN 522, Closed Report 523
are provided in the event that workflow exceptions occur which require non
standard session handling. For example, when a session PIN 522 code provided
is found to be invalid, the process may utilize an alternative method to associate
this user and session to the correct incident previously created, such as the use of
challenge questions, validation of personal data previously captured, or
comparison of unique device or application identification codes. Another
possible example of a workflow exception is when the current session is
associated to a report record with a status code set to a Closed Record 523. In
that case, the session will be restricted from further edits, available for read-only
review, or branch to a supplemental report input module, if so permitted by the
agency-specific settings.
[0071]       FIG. 5 illustrates the details of the "Front Lobby" module 600 with
associated sub-modules and components. As stated above, the Front Lobby
module 600 is the point of initial system contact with reporting party. The
Handshake module 610 contains the Language 611 that enables dynamic
configuration of the language used, or activation of logic in support of language
line services wherein a third-party joins the call to serve as an intermediate
translator between the system and the reporting party. The Greetings and
Warning 612 provides announcements and captures affirmation from the
reporting party that information being provided is true and correct, along with
provision for the user to exit the process. This component also can be configured
                                            18

to, if so configured, to capture biometric data samples for unique caller
identification and authorization.
[0072]       In order to provide the reporting party access to their report in future
sessions, the Assign Session ID 613 provides them with unique ID information.
This is institution-specific and incident specific. Should the user have ID
information already, they can provide it via the Prior Session ID/PIN 614 and the
system will pre-load all current crime report data for their incident. In FIG.6, the
Handshake sub-module 610 can also utilize the Prior Session ID/PIN 614
entered by an official to gain access to the Report Room module 900.
[0073]       FIG. 5 further illustrates the Triage sub-module 630, which is entered
after Assign Session ID 613 is completed. Provided an existing/prior Session
ID/PIN 614 is not found, the system will follow the process in the following
sequence: Confirm RP Phone 631; Obtain RP Name 632; confirm if the user is
the Reporting Party on behalf of the victim or is the Victim 633 of the crime; and
the Type of Crime 634. These are key inputs for a crime report and must be
successfully collected.
[0074]       Given these basic items 631-634, the Triage sub-module 630 will use
them to determine several things including: is this an Included Crime 635 in the
types accepted by this institution using this system; if this is a Priority Crime 636
that requires an immediate response by an official; if this is a Duplicate 637 of
crime report previously started or completed; if this is an emergency and the
reporting party should be Referred to "911" immediately 640; if the incident
report of this type for this institution is to be Referred to another system 641
(i.e., Graffiti Removal Hotline); or if the crime occurred in an area that is under
the jurisdiction of another institution and should therefore be Referred to other
institution 643. Once the Triage questioning sequence and logic is processed,
and Start New 638 report is triggered, the flow proceeds 645 to the Report
Input/Edit module 700 if the report is new or incomplete - or to the Report
Review/Output module 800 if the report is complete.
[0075]       If the Check Duplicate 637 module results in a match to a record that
is incomplete, the process will proceed to the Follow-up sub-module 650 to
enable completion of the existing report. The Follow-up sub-module 650
contains questioning items associated with a reporting party who: wishes to
                                             19

Input More Info 651; needs to provide more Required Items 652 not successfully
captured during previous sessions; or must provide Requested Items 653 that an
official needs in order to finalize the report. Additional capabilities provided in
the Follow-up sub-module 650 can include enablement of the reporting party to
complete follow-up actions for the same incident or prohibit further
manipulation of the report.
[0076]      The Follow-up sub-module 650 components also include
Notifications 655 for the reporting party regarding the status of the report
including: if the report has been Finalized 656; the issuance of a Case Number
657; if No Report 659 is warranted; if the report is Unfounded 660, Duplicated
661, or has been Closed 663. When an outbound session is initiated and the user
has entered the valid session ID and PIN, they will be directed immediately to
the Follow-up sub-module 650.
[0077]      The Other Requests sub-module 670, includes methods for a user to
submit: Suspicious Activity 671 (anonymously if desired); Citizen Complaints
672; or Officer Appreciation 674 comments. Availability of these options are
institution-specific and Other Services 680 may be entered or dynamically set
during session initialization. Non-limiting examples being Graffiti Removal 681
or Other Services 683, as according to design preference.
[0078]      The Front Lobby 600 continues the conceptual analogy to an RP's
communication with officials at the station by providing the Farwell sub-module
690. The reporting party who has entered a crime report into the system is
further supported by being informed about What to Expect 691. This is context
sensitive and anticipates the concerns of the reporting party. This also provides
guidance on next steps, and pragmatic commentary about the type of crime they
have been a victim of.
[0079]      The Farwell sub-module 690 also enables reporting parties to receive
Forensic Tips 693 that describe specific things they can do to identify facts or
evidence that may support the investigation of the crime. It includes suggestions
for locating stolen property, preventing re-occurrences or networking with
neighbors to better detect criminal activity. The Survey 695 enables the user to
provide feedback about the system and the police services they may have
received. There can be other surveys made available from other institutions
                                           20

targeted toward victim services. The Salutations 697 gives final instructions and
announcements prior to being disconnected from the current session via Exit
module 1000.
[0080]       FIG. 6 shows a suitable embodiment of the Report Input/Edit module
700 along with the sub-modules containing the questioning sequences that
capture the crime report information from the reporting party. Initial entry into
the system is depicted at the top of the figure in the Instructions sub-module 710,
and continues down through subsequent sub-modules as determined by the type
of crime specified. Each component represents one or more questions, the
collection of recorded responses, decision-logic, data transfer, and session status
updates. The Report Input-Edit module 700 and Review/Output module 800 can
serve as the service point for completing and obtaining a crime report.
[0081]       The Warning 711 is where the user is admonished regarding the legal
consequences of providing a false or misleading crime report. Basic Instructions
712 are also provided and the user may Exit 713 the system at this point if
desired without creating a crime report.
[0082]       Should the user continue, the Incident Detail sub-module 720 will
first Confirm RP Phone 721 to obtain the best contact number for return calls
and an optional email address. If the user is reporting on behalf of a business or
institution, the system will Obtain RP Name details 722 and the name of the
Business 723. For crime types that involve damage or loss, the Total Value Loss
725 obtains the total monetary sum of all items associated with the incident. The
Incident Location 726 is then captured as well as the Incident Time 726 and
date. Incident Detail sub-module 720 question items may be bypassed after
employing data received during the initial session connection (caller ID, ANI,
DNIS), or may proceed to prompt the user for information if needed. Additional
information is then captured in the Victim(s)/RP sub-module 730 to include: RP
Address 731; Date of birth 732; Driver's License or ID card 733; as well
information about Additional Victims 734.
[0083]       The module Report Input/Edit 700 then captures the details about
items that were taken or damaged in the Loss/Damage sub-module 740. This
part of the questioning sequence is iterative enabling the user to provide details
on multiple items. In addition to Item Name 741, Item Details 742, Item Value
                                          21

743, Identification Numbers 744, Item location 746, this sequence also captures
the Explanation of damage 747 (if appropriate) and also enables Upload of
Media 748 (images, video, etc.) for each item.
[0084]      The Suspect(s) sub-module 750 depicts the suspect information
question sequence including the Names 751, Descriptions 752, location of
possible suspects or suspect Vehicles 753 associated with the crime. Information
on multiple suspects can be accepted.
[0085]      In the Narrative/M.O. sub-module 760, the question sequence is
determined by the system depending upon the type of crime and session
information. For burglary, the Structure Type 762 and Point of Entry 763 are
included. Most other crimes also include the Crime Area 761, Suspect Actions
765, Crime Description 766 and the RP Statement 767 (if appropriate) that
captures what happened.
[0086]      The sub-module Evidence 770 follows the sequence of questions
regarding any physical evidence that may be known to the RP including: Type of
Evidence 771; the Location 772 of the evidence; Comments 773 about nature of
or details about the item. Finally, here too the Upload Media 774 enables
submission of images, video or other media related to the evidence. Once the
required responses are received, the flow returns to the Front Lobby module 600.
[0087]      Returning to FIG. 5, the progression can resume through the Farewell
sub-module 690. The previously determined incident type is then employed in
the What to Expect 691 that provides context-specific details about how the
institution will respond and what additional steps the RP may be required to
complete. Forensic Tips 693 then examines information previously collected
from the RP and provides context-specific guidance on observing and collecting
additional evidence, and suggestions regarding recovery of property, as one of
many possible examples.
[0088]      An optional Survey 695 enables the RP to complete one or more
surveys. Finally, the system can provide institution-specific Salutations 697 to
the RP. For this example, the computerized interaction with the RP is complete
at this point and processing continues 647 to the Exit module 1000.
                                          22

[0089]       FIG. 7 describes mechanisms in the Exit module 1000, which are also
repeated in FIGS. 11 (official review of report) and 15 (reporting party follow
up). Details of the Exit module 1000 are fully presented in the description of
FIG. 15, provided below. FIG. 7 is presented here to shown one scenario where
a robbery report is being entered by a reporting party, and the session is
terminated with required steps being completed to close the session and exit the
system.
[0090]       FIGS. 8 - 11 show an alternative progression through Initialization
module 500, continuing to Report Room module 900, then to Exit module 1000
in the context of an Officer (for example, official or supervisor) review. In FIG.
8, when an "official" is requesting a review of the report, Report Room module
900 is invoked, the processes of which are detailed in FIG. 10. After completion
of the Report Room module 900, the process goes to the Exit module 1000,
which is fully detailed in FIG. 11. Many aspects shown in FIG. 8 are self
explanatory or detailed in the following FIGS.
[0091]       FIG. 9 is an illustration of another example of the Initialization
module 500, where the caller is identified as an authorized official rather than a
reporting party. In this scenario, a web based device is detected 534, 539 and the
official's security code or access is vetted 547. The process proceeds along
similar paths as described in FIG. 4, therefore no additional discussion is deemed
necessary.
[0092]       FIG. 10 is an illustration of the Report Room module 900 along with
the sub-modules containing the tasks officials will perform (per FIG. 8's
arrangement) associated with crime reports entered into this system. Officials
may utilize this module using voice or a web-based application. The Queues
sub-module 910 provides the entry point for officials after processing through
the Initialization module 500. The Alerts 911, provides access to any priority
messages such as would be generated from hits on key word searches in
responses. New Reports 912 can be queued up for review based on Alerts 911
results. The Follow-up 913 enables access to reports that have been previously
reviewed for which additional reporting party input has been received; items
targeted for follow up can be processed.
                                            23

[0093]       The Transcriptions 914 enables officials to complete manual
transcription of any items in the system pending transcription and the items are
ranked by relative priority. The queue of transcription items is inclusive of all
those associated with the crime reports for that institution.
[0094]       The graphical interface of the Transcriptions 914 enables the official
to view the question item details and listen to the recording collected from the
reporting party. The official can then repeat what they heard into the system
which then uses automated speech recognition (ASR) that has been trained for
their voice to generate the text from their voice recording. The result is
displayed with the option to score the transcription, designate the need for
confirmation from the reporting party, or to approve the transcription. Other
options include the ability for any system-based follow-up with the reporting
party to be dependent on a series of modified questions as specified by the
official. The exemplary system can be designed to pre-designate incident types
along with required and optional elements needed to fully complete the report; as
well as dynamically generate a listing of required report information not yet
received successfully; and/or automatically field-level compare a selected report
to other reports to find, visualize and enable a merge of data from duplicate
incident reports; and/or supplementally notify the existence of key words or
phrases with a suggested action.
[0095]       Transcriptions 914 also displays the responses to all other question
items in the same sub-module and component for that crime report. For example,
in the Victim(s)/RP sub-module 730 (seen in FIG. 6), the DL/ID Card 733 may
include question items for "State", "ID type" and "ID number." When "ID
number" is in the queue for transcription, the user can be shown responses to all
three items to better aid in establishing the context for the item being transcribed.
[0096]       When the New Reports 912 is accessed and a report is selected, the
official is then provided the option of Summary Review 920 tasks including:
exclusive review of Entered Items 921; review of Required Items only 922; the
required items that are Missing 923; or to Request a Copy 924 of the report via
email or via other output options.
[0097]       The Detail Review sub-module 930 provides selective access to the
report content organized into major divisions: Crime/Incident 931; Victim(s)/RP
                                          24

932; Loss/Damage 933; Suspect(s) 934; report Narrative 935; Modus Operandi
(M.O.) Information 936; and Evidence 937.
[0098]       The Inquire More sub-module 940 provides methods for further
interaction with the reporting party, or use of other resources to investigate the
crime report in greater detail. The system provides a Check Duplicates 941 that
searches for other incidents within the system that match details of the selected
report based upon items such as location, time of incident, or suspect
information. When duplicate reports are identified, the official is able to
consolidate items between reports.
[0099]       When appropriate, the user may create a Cross-Reference 945
between two or more incidents in the system. The official can also utilize the
Follow-up with RP 942 to solicit more information from the reporting party.
This may include initiation of an outbound phone call to the reporting party by
the voice application, an email message, or text message.
[00100]      The Check Area 946 contains options to search external records or
crime database systems for possible matches to the details of the selected report.
Results are presented to the official showing the correlation.
[00101]      The Admin Details sub-module 940 provides administrative
information about the selected report including one or more of: Status of the
Report 951; an option to Reassign 953 ownership to another official; or Notify
954 another official (such as a criminal investigator) via email with the selected
report forwarded as an attachment.
[00102]      The Settings option 955 enables access to a graphical interface to
administer the institution specific settings in the system. A secondary username
and ID are required for access to this component.
[00103]      The Report Room module 900 can also contain sub-modules Validate
Report 960 and Close/Forward 970 that enable the official to ultimately approve
or reject the crime report and Finalize 961 tasks on the selected report. Each
component requires input by the official to properly document the action(s)
taken. The Comment 963 enables the official to communicate the outcome of the
crime report to the RP with the option to select pre-defined phrases or manually
enter the desired comments. The Transmission 964 of the final outcome can be
                                          25

communicated to the reporting party by the official using the voice system,
email, instant message, or text message. The official status is set when a report is
Closed 975 and may include: No Report 971; Unfounded 972; Duplicate 973; or
Expired 974. After Closed 975, the process proceeds to the Exit module 1000.
[00104]       FIG. 11 is an illustration of a suitable embodiment of the Exit module
1000 and sub-modules that handle session termination procedures and system
functions including: Update Case records 1010, Notifications 1020 and the
Shredder 1030. FIG. 11 shows the Exit module 1000 in the context of an
Official reviewing the report. The Terminate Communications Session 1011,
closes the system's connection to the user, and the processing continues with one
or more additional steps including: Encrypt Data 1013, Compress Media 1015,
Transfer to Storage 1017 and Update Report Status 1018, the functions of the
component steps being self-explanatory.
[00105]       The Notifications sub-module 1020 processes the transfer of
information to concerned parties and other external systems. Update Web Links
1021 updates URL addresses to media attachments and report summaries. Any
email messages and instant messages are processes in the Send Email(s) 1023.
Update Prior Notifications 1025 updates or removes prior notifications posted
for this report while Post New Notifications 1027 send new Notifications to the
appropriate queues. The Export Records 1028 manages the transfer of the report
to the institution's system (i.e., RMS) if appropriate.
[00106]       The sub-module Shredder 1030 performs cleanup of report records
depending upon the status of the report. If this is a Closed Report 1031 all data
for this crime report is removed from system storage and log files. A Cancelled
Report 1033 is retained but flagged for removal after a period designated by the
institution. When a Duplicate Report 1035 is encountered during processing, this
component will remove duplicate data from storage and logs. The Scrub Log
Files 1037 will ensure no personal or sensitive data is retained on the system for
this session. Finally the system will Reset Session Variables 1038 to end the
session.
[00107]       FIGS. 12 - 15 detail an RP follow-up session processing, after the
initial call-in report, from Initialization module 500, to Front Lobby module 600
(Follow-up sub-module), then to Exit module 1000. Aspects of this progression
                                            26

are provided below/above, many features being self-explanatory. FIG. 12 shows
the System Processing system 400 where the reporting party has completed an
initial call-in and is following up to provide additional details (and/or to allow
the request a copy of the report). Follow up may be initiated by the exemplary
system, via a call, email, text, etc. to the reporting party. Initialization module
500 processes the call/contact and forwards to the Front Lobby module 600
which determines that the caller is a prior reporting party and sends the call to
the Follow-up sub-module 650 for appropriate transfer to the Review/Output
module 800, based on the caller's information. Review/Output module 800 then
queries the caller for the additional details and Hears Details sub-module 810
processes the added information. If the caller requests a copy, then Request
Copy sub-module 820 is invoked and the heard details are Appended 830 to the
report. The process then transfers to Farwell sub-module 690 in the Front Lobby
module 600, where the system proceeds to the Exit module 1000.
[00108]       FIG. 13 is an illustration of the Initialization module 500 and the
paths taken for a reporting party during a follow up. Contrary to the previous
paths seen in FIGS. 4 and 9, an Outbound Call 540 is invoked to contact the
prior reporting party. A Follow up 555 status is flagged and the Initialization
module 500 transfers to the Front Lobby module 900, which performs the
additional querying/follow up questions.
[00109]       FIG. 14 is an illustration of the Front Lobby module 600 steps when a
follow up is performed. In contrast to the former Front Lobby module 600 path
seen in FIG. 5, the Get Prior Session ID 614 sub-module 614 is invoked,
correlating this exchange with the reporting party to a prior report. Then
Required Items 652 and Requested Items 653 are cycled through to obtain
additional information as seen in steps (691, 693, 695, 697) of Farwell sub
module 690. Upon completion of the Salutations 697, the process proceeds to
the Exit module 1000.
[00110]       FIG. 15 illustrates a suitable embodiment of the Exit module 1000, as
entered via Report Room module 900, shows sub-modules that handle session
termination procedures and system functions including: Update Case records
1010, Notifications 1020 and the Shredder 1030. FIG. 15 shows the Exit module
1000 in the context of a reporting party following up on a previous report.
                                             27

Terminate Communications Session 1011 closes the system's connection to the
user, and the processing continues with additional steps including: Encrypt Data
1013, Compress Media 1015, Transfer to Storage 1017 and Update Report
Status 1018, these functions being self-explanatory.
[00111]      Next, the Notifications sub-module 1020 processes the transfer of
information to concerned parties and other external systems. For example,
Update Web Links 1021 updates URL addresses to media attachments and
report summaries. Any email messages and instant messages are processed in
Send Email(s) 1023 and queued/connected to contact information via Queue
Out-bound Contact 1024. Update Prior Notifications 1025 updates or removes
prior notifications posted for this report while Post New Notifications 1027
sends new Notifications to the appropriate queues. The Export Records 1028
manages the transfer of the report to the institution's system (i.e., RMS) if
appropriate.
[00112]      After completion of Notifications sub-module 1020, the sub-module
Shredder 1030 performs cleanup of report records depending upon the status of
the report. If this is a Closed Report 1031, all data for this crime report is
removed from system storage and log files. A Cancelled Report 1033 retains the
report, but is flagged for removal after a period designated by a respective
institution. When a Duplicate Report 1035 is encountered during processing, this
component will remove duplicate data from storage and logs. The Scrub Log
Files 1037 process will ensure no personal or sensitive data is retained on the
system for this session. Finally the system will Reset Session Variables 1038 to
end the session.
[00113]      FIG. 16 is an illustration of Review/Output module's 800 functions,
which is applicable to any of the suitable examples provided above. The present
scenario described for this Review Output module 800 is for a situation where a
report was previously entered, and no follow up is required by the RP.
Nonetheless, the interested party can still access the report to review it or request
a copy by various means.
[00114]      For example, transcription events may have occurred yielding the
need to confirm or alter of previous responses for required items. In that case,
those question items are re-presented to the user in the Front Lobby module's
                                           28

600 Follow-up sub-module 650. The Review/Output module 800 provides a
sub-module process for the user to Hear Details 810, limited to just the Required
Items 811 for their report, or all Entered Items 812. The Request Copy sub
module 820 can email the reporting party (RP) via process Email RP 821, or
Email 3 rd Party 822, or request regular Mail to RP 823 via a postal service.
[00115]     In some embodiments, the report or a portion of the report
information would be automatically transmitted/forwarded to external public
safety systems, as well as to select recipients. This may be accomplished by a
computerized out-bound calling/emailing system that would contact the
concerned parties via computerized telephone calls, text-messages, and instant
messaging services or imaging devices.
[00116]     Additionally, in the Append or Cancel sub-module 830, users who
may have previously completed a report can Add Comments 831, Complete
More Items 832 (non-required items), or Add Media 833 via upload. They may
also Request Cancelation 835 of the report, or opt to Generate a New 836 crime
report.
[00117]     FIG. 17 is an illustration of an exemplary structure of a Question
Item 1300 object, along with the Fixed 1302 and Dynamic 1304 properties for
each individual or set of Question Items (See FIG. 18). Each questioning
sequence is established by linking the questions items in the logical sequence
through the unique Tag 1312 and the Next Item Tag 1352. When multiple
question items must be collected in a module, these values are initialized based
upon the module structure but may be altered by factors such as: institution
specific settings; source of initial connection to the system; mode of
communication; quality of transmission; quality of recent transcriptions;
operational conditions of the institution; user and incident location; the previous
responses input by the user; and the system status, and so forth.
[00118]     The Dynamic properties 1304 of a question item store details
including: a link to the Question Recording 1320 for pre-recorded media (i.e.,
voice, video); the Question Text 1322 (i.e., "What is your name?"); the Missed
Text 1324 is available should the initial prompt yield difficulty (i.e., "Say your
last name, and then your first name.");
                                          29

[00119]      The properties Urgency 1326, Importance 1328, Required 1330, and
Decision Item 1349 are set when the object is created. These are used to modify
the questioning sequence dynamically. For example, under certain dynamic
conditions, the reporting party will only be prompted to respond to Required
1330 items. In other cases the system will dynamically choose the method of
transcription depending upon the Urgency 1326 or Importance 1328 of the
response. A Decision Item 1349 is a question item that requires an immediate
response (including transcription) before the questioning sequence can continue.
If a Decision Item 1349 cannot be obtained, the session will typically be
terminated, though not necessarily so.
[00120]      When a response in obtained from the user, the Recording Date 1332
and time of the response is stored. The Response Recording 1334 is the link to
the audio recording of the response. The Response Text 1336 stores the text of
the response obtain directly from the user (e.g., via SMS or web-based session),
or the text from the audio transcription.
[00121]      The transcription process will sometimes yield an Alternate Text
1338 string if the primary transcription is not definitive. The Confidence 1346 is
also used to capture a relative factor as to the quality of the transcription. The
Validated property indicates the response to the question item has been
successfully obtained to the desired confidence level-or has been manually
validated by an official.
[00122]      Voice transcription (manual or automated) can also include
determination of the Demeanor 1348 of the speaker. For example, the values
such as "positive", "neutral" or "negative" may be used to dynamically alter the
questioning sequence as the session progresses. Similar to how an official who is
speaking directly to a crime victim will limit their questioning if the victim is
upset or otherwise unable to effectively respond, so too the Demeanor 1348
value may limit or alter the extent of the question items covered in the modules
and sub-modules.
[00123]      When selected question items are Required 1330 and the system is
unable to obtain an adequate transcription from the RP's response, there may be
an alternative question item that, if successful, could be used to successfully
derive a response to the original question item. The Alternate Item Tag 1350
                                          30

holds such an item, if available. For example, should the system have difficulty
transcribing the RP's name or date of birth, the alternate question item could be
the Driver's License/ID question item which could then be used with an external
system to obtain the RP's name and date of birth.
[00124]      The Attachments 1340 property contains links to any media provided
by the user for this question item. The Notes 1342 contains information added to
the item during the review process. In a crime report scenario, the set of
questions would include the fields contained in the typical crime report of the
target institution; and each question would include designations of whether it is
required or optional relative to the nature of incident, and/or a target level of
transcription timeliness, and/or a desired level of transcription accuracy.
[00125]      In summary, FIG. 17 exemplifies the structure of a Question Item
1300, along with the Fixed 1302 and Dynamic 1304 properties for each Question
Item 1300. The dynamic properties of each question item can be initialized upon
entry into Report Input/Edit module 700. The questioning sequence can be
established by linking the Question Items 1300 in a predetermined sequence in
each sub-module and associated series of components. Certain components may
be omitted depending upon the type of crime being reported, and the status of
the system and session. In order to provide a questioning order baseline, the
questioning sequence would be organized consistent with patterns used by
officials of that institution when directly responding to an incident to create a
crime report.
[00126]      FIG. 18 is a flow path illustrating one possible embodiment for
processing an individual Question Item 1400. As described previously, Question
Item(s) 1400 are linked by Tag, Next Item Tag and, optionally, Alternate Item
Tag. The Previous Item 1402 references this instance of a question and the
object is prepared 1410 and begins processing. The Prompt 1412 is given to the
user and the response is collected 1414. If the criteria for Success 1416 are not
met, the object is checked to see if alternate text is available 1418 (Missed-Text).
Then Alternate Prompt 1420 is given and if un-Successful 1424, the next
processing step depends whether the item is required 1426. If required,
processing cannot continue and the processing transfers to the Exit module 1000,
otherwise the system will move on directly to the Next Question Item 1406.
                                           31

[00127]      In some embodiments, the analysis of responses to the questions
would include the incorporation of previous responses, including parsing of
responses with comparison to a glossary of significant key words or phrases,
along with appropriate computerized instructions to be executed when such
words or phrases are encountered. Accordingly, analysis of incident data may
include: detection of key words or phrases that trigger certain behaviors; a search
of historical premise information at the incident location; comparison to other
incidents within the geographic region; chronological alignment with other
incidents; and comparison of suspect information received with other incident
reports. These complementary and verification information would be obtained
from an external database to identify potential correlations with other incident
data for the purpose of enhanced decision support during investigation activities.
[00128]      To assist a user or subsequent official, the exemplary system
(depending on the application) would include a computerized display displaying
a graphical representation of the institution's incident (e.g., crime) report
template, which would contain text of responses provided by the reporting user;
time of response input; highlight of required elements for the given incident;
context-sensitive pre-defined lists of responses associated with select elements in
the template; field-specific access to audio recordings of actual user utterances;
access to media uploaded by the user; and ability for the user to override the
initial response while retaining it for future reference. Additionally,
questions/response conversion could include computerized vocalizations which
contain audio annunciations organized by the institution's incident (e.g., crime)
report template, the vocalizations having field names and responses for
minimum-required information; actual audio response if the response
transcription is missing or of low confidence; optional playback of non-required
report information submitted by the user; field-specific access to audio
recordings of actual user utterances; and access to audio media uploaded by the
user.
[00129]      If the initial or alternate responses are successfully obtained (Yes
responses to 1416 or 1424), response data is Stored 1430. The Decision Item
property 1432 is checked and this determines if an Instant Transcription 1436 is
initiated, or the response is Queued 1434 for normal transcription. Under
                                             32

Queued 1434 for normal transcription, the process proceeds to the next Item
1406 and transcription is de-coupled from the questioning sequence allowing for
optimization of transcription resources.
[00130]      For Question Items requiring Instant Transcription 1436, the session
is suspended until the transcription response is received or a Timeout 1438 point
is reached. If the transcription fails or times out 1438 and an Alternate Question
Item 1440 has been designated, the process continues with that Alternate Item
1442, eventually arriving to Next Item 1406.
[00131]      Under both transcription circumstances (1436 or 1434), the relative
priority of transcription for each item is included in the transcription request.
These "urgency" and "importance" properties (along with Decision Item 1432
and Required 1426 flags), will determine its placement in each transcription
queue as well as the transcription mechanism chosen. The values of these
properties are pre-defined and set during session initialization. For example, if
the crime report is for an incident involving harassment, the question item
related to the suspect name would have elevated values for urgency and
importance. Whereas the question item for the street address where the
harassment occurred may have lower values. Therefore, the transcription of the
suspect name would be placed higher in the transcription queue than the suspect
address. This example assumes the queues have one or more items waiting for
transcription. If the queues are empty at the point an audio response is ready for
transcription, it will be submitted for transcription immediately.
[00132]      The above examples are detailed in the context of a crime report,
however, other scenarios not related to crime may be easily addressed by the
exemplary embodiments, by revising the Question Item 1300 object (questions
being asked) to reflect the type of service being addressed. For example, an
insurance claim could be processed using an insurance related questioning
process. Therefore, the exemplary system can be utilized for purchasing a ticket,
buying insurance, reporting an incident, reporting an accident, or reporting a
crime. Accordingly, many other industries that require a report to be generated
from information gathered from a reporting party could benefit from an
exemplary system as described above.
                                            33

[00133]     While various processes have been detailed in a specific order, it is
understood that the specific order or hierarchy of steps in the processes disclosed
is an example of exemplary approaches. Based upon design preferences, the
specific order or hierarchy of steps in the processes may be rearranged while
remaining within the scope of the present disclosure. The accompanying method
claims present elements of the various steps in a sample order, and are not meant
to be limited to the specific order or hierarchy presented. Moreover, it is
understood that various logic and flow decisions are hardware/software based
being implemented on networked computer system(s), allowing a transformation
of information coming in from an audible source to be machine converted into a
"high quality," apportioned and filtered and properly formatted "written" output.
[00134]     Accordingly, it is understood that the modules/sub-modules,
functions and operation of various elements of the described embodiments can
be implemented in server-based networked systems, with attendant databases,
memory systems, and software programs to execute the described
functionalities. For example, the exemplary reporting system can be positioned
on a server having hardware as illustrated in FIG. 22, with associated input
hardware (to process voice/data) calls.
[00135]     Accordingly, the various embodiments described above are
understood to significantly reduce the manpower and time needed for
conventional incident reporting, providing significant increases in efficiency and
productive allocation of human (i.e., officer/official) resources. The ability to
offload ministerial duties to an "intelligent" prompting computerized system that
not only provides intelligent querying but, among other things, intelligent report
formation, in the field of call-in processing, is understood to be a significant
improvement over anything in the prior art.
