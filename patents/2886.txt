   This application claims priority from Japanese Application No. 2017-002621 filed on
 5 11 January 2017, the contents of which are to be taken as incorporated herein by this
   reference.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Field of the Invention
10         The present invention relates to a hot water apparatus.
   Description of the Background Art
           A hot water apparatus including a heat exchanger for exchanging heat between
   heating gas and water and/or hot water is disclosed in International Publication
   W02015/141995, for example.         The hot water apparatus disclosed in this literature
15 includes a sensible heat recovery heat exchanger and a latent heat recovery heat
   exchanger.    The sensible heat recovery heat exchanger and the latent heat recovery
   heat exchanger have cases that communicate with each other.       The case of the sensible
   heat recovery heat exchanger has a lower end provided with a first flange portion, and
   the case of the latent heat recovery heat exchanger has an upper end provided with a
20 second flange portion.    The first flange portion and the second flange portion are
   connected to each other.
           In the hot water apparatus disclosed in the above-described literature, drainage
   water produced inside the sensible heat recovery heat exchanger flows downward along
   the inner surface of the case of the sensible heat recovery heat exchanger.    When this
25 drainage water flows to the lower end of the case of the sensible heat recovery heat
   exchanger, this drainage water may flow out through between the first flange portion of
   the sensible heat recovery heat exchanger and the second flange portion of the latent
   heat recovery heat exchanger.
                                                - 1-

   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
            The present invention has been made in light of the above-described problems.
   An object of the present invention is to provide a hot water apparatus capable of
   suppressing drainage water produced inside a heat exchanger from flowing out through
 5 between a first flange portion of a heat exchanger and a second flange portion
   connected to the first flange portion.
            A hot water apparatus of the present invention includes a heat exchanger and a
   housing.     The heat exchanger includes a heat exchange portion and a first case in
   which the heat exchange portion is housed.       The housing includes a second case
10 connected to the first case of the heat exchanger.     The first case of the heat exchanger
   includes a first circumferential wall portion, a first opening provided at a lower end of
   the first circumferential wall portion, and a first flange portion located above the first
   opening and extending outward from the first circumferential wall portion.         The
   second case of the housing includes a second flange portion connected to the first
15 flange portion, a second circumferential wall portion arranged inside the second flange
   portion, and a second opening provided at an upper end of the second circumferential
   wall portion.    The first circumferential wall portion of the heat exchanger includes a
   downwardly-extending wall portion inserted through the second opening of the housing
   into an inside of the second circumferential wall portion.     In a state where the
20 downwardly-extending wall portion is arranged inside the second circumferential wall
   portion, the first opening is located below an upper surface of the second flange portion.
            According to the hot water apparatus of the present invention, in the state where
   the downwardly-extending wall portion is arranged inside the second circumferential
   wall portion, the first opening is located below an upper surface of the second flange
25 portion.    Accordingly, the drainage water produced inside the heat exchanger flows
   along the downwardly-extending wall portion downward from the first opening.            Thus,
   the drainage water can be suppressed from flowing through the first opening onto the
   upper surface of the second flange portion.      Thereby, the drainage water produced
   inside the heat exchanger can be suppressed from flowing out through between the first
                                                -2-

   flange portion and the second flange portion.
           In the above-described hot water apparatus, the first opening is located below a
   lower surface of the second flange portion.      Accordingly, the distance from the first
   opening to the upper surface of the second flange portion in the vertical direction is
 5 greater than the distance from the upper surface of the second flange portion to the
   lower surface thereof in the vertical direction.   Thus, the drainage water produced
   inside the heat exchanger can be effectively suppressed from flowing through the first
   opening onto the upper surface of the second flange portion.
           In the above-described hot water apparatus, the downwardly-extending wall
10 portion is provided on an entire circumference of the first circumferential wall portion.
   Thus, the drainage water produced inside the heat exchanger can be suppressed from
   flowing through the first opening onto the upper surface of the second flange portion in
   the entire circumference of the first circumferential wall portion.
           In the above-described hot water apparatus, the first circumferential wall
15 portion includes a plate member.     The downwardly-extending wall portion is formed
   by folding the plate member at the lower end of the first circumferential wall portion.
   Accordingly, the drainage water produced inside the heat exchanger can be prevented
   from flowing from the lower end of the first circumferential wall portion into the inside
   of the downwardly-extending wall portion.        Thus, the downwardly-extending wall
20 portion can be prevented from corroding from its inside due to the drainage water.
           In the above-described hot water apparatus, the downwardly-extending wall
   portion is arranged such that a gap is interposed between the downwardly-extending
   wall portion and the second circumferential wall portion.      Accordingly, the drainage
   water produced inside the heat exchanger can be suppressed from flowing, due to
25 surface tension, from the first opening through between the downwardly-extending wall
   portion and the second circumferential wall portion onto the upper surface of the
   second flange portion.
           In the above-described hot water apparatus, the housing includes a connection
   portion connected to a lower end of the second circumferential wall portion.      The
                                                -3-

   connection portion extends toward an inside of the second circumferential wall portion,
   and is arranged such that a gap is interposed between the connection portion and a
   lower end of the downwardly-extending wall portion.      The gap between the
   downwardly-extending wall portion and the second circumferential wall portion is
 5 greater than the gap between the downwardly-extending wall portion and the
   connection portion.    Accordingly, the drainage water produced inside the heat
   exchanger is likely to flow more into the gap between the downwardly-extending wall
   portion and the connection portion than into the gap between the
   downwardly-extending wall portion and the second circumferential wall portion.
10 Thus, the drainage water can be suppressed from flowing through between the
   downwardly-extending wall portion and the second circumferential wall portion.
   Thereby, the drainage water produced inside the heat exchanger can be suppressed
   from flowing through between the downwardly-extending wall portion and the second
   circumferential wall portion onto the upper surface of the second flange portion.
15         In the above-described hot water apparatus, the housing includes a connection
   portion connected to a lower end of the second circumferential wall portion.    The
   connection portion is inclined so as to be downwardly sloped toward the inside of the
   second circumferential wall portion, and is arranged such that a gap is interposed
   between the connection portion and a lower end of the downwardly-extending wall
20 portion. Accordingly, the drainage water produced inside the heat exchanger flows
   along the connection portion toward the inside of the second circumferential wall
   portion.   Thus, the drainage water can be suppressed from flowing toward the second
   flange portion.   Thereby, the drainage water produced inside the heat exchanger can
   be suppressed from flowing onto the upper surface of the second flange portion.
25         In the above-described hot water apparatus, the housing includes a rising
   coupling portion arranged inside the connection portion and rising upward from the
   connection portion, a through hole surrounded by the rising coupling portion, and a
   main body portion inserted into the through hole.   The rising coupling portion is
   joined from outside to an upper end of the main body portion. Accordingly, the rising
                                               -4-

   coupling portion can be readily welded to the upper end of the main body portion.
            In the above-described hot water apparatus, the rising coupling portion includes
   a first cutout portion provided at an upper end of the rising coupling portion.      The
   main body portion includes a second cutout portion provided at the upper end of the
 5 main body portion.       The first cutout portion is arranged so as to overlap with the
   second cutout portion.      Accordingly, the drainage water can be caused to flow from
   the first cutout portion and the second cutout portion into the through hole.      Thereby,
   the drainage water can be readily discharged.
            The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present
10 invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the
   present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

   DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
           The embodiments of the present invention will be hereinafter described with
10 reference to the accompanying drawings.
           (First Embodiment)
           First, the configuration of a hot water apparatus in the first embodiment of the
   present invention will be hereinafter described with reference to Fig. 1.
           As shown in Fig. 1, a hot water apparatus 100 of the present embodiment
15 mainly includes a sensible heat recovery heat exchanger (primary heat exchanger) 10,
   an ignition plug 14, a latent heat recovery heat exchanger (secondary heat exchanger)
   20, a burner 30, a chamber 31, a fan assembly 32, a duct 33, a venturi 34, an orifice 35,
   a gas valve 36, a pipe 40, a bypass pipe 41, a three-way valve 42, a liquid to liquid heat
   exchanger 43, a hydronic pipe 44, a housing 50, and an exhaust collection and guide
20 member 70.      All of components except for housing 50 among the above-mentioned
   components are arranged inside housing 50.
           Fuel gas flows through gas valve 36 and orifice 35 into venturi 34.    The mixed
   gas mixed in venturi 34 is fed to fan assembly 32.    Fan assembly 32 serves to supply
   the mixed gas to burner 30.
25         Fan assembly 32 is connected to chamber 31 that is connected to burner 30.
   The mixed gas supplied from fan assembly 32 is fed to burner 30 through chamber 31.
           Burner 30 serves to produce heating gas to be supplied to sensible heat recovery
   heat exchanger (heat exchanger) 10.      The mixed gas blown out of burner 30 is ignited
   by ignition plug 14 and turned into combustion gas.
                                               -6-

           Burner 30, sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 and latent heat recovery
   heat exchanger 20 are connected such that combustion gas flows sequentially through
   sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 and latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20 so
   as to be heat-exchanged with water and/or hot water.       Exhaust collection and guide
 5 member 70 is connected to latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20.       To exhaust
   collection and guide member 70, duct 33 is connected, which extends to the outside of
   housing 50.    Thereby, combustion gas having passed through latent heat recovery heat
   exchanger 20 is caused to flow through exhaust collection and guide member 70 and
   discharged through duct 33 to the outside of housing 50.
10         A portion of pipe 40 on the hot water exit side relative to sensible heat recovery
   heat exchanger 10 is connected to bypass pipe 41 by three-way valve 42.        Liquid to
   liquid heat exchanger 43 is connected to bypass pipe 41.      The warm water flowing
   through the inside of liquid to liquid heat exchanger 43 flows on the outside of warm
   water pipe 44, thereby allowing heat exchange between the warm water flowing
15 through liquid to liquid heat exchanger 43 and the warm water flowing through warm
   water pipe 44.
           Then, the configuration of a heat exchanger set of the present embodiment will
   be hereinafter described with reference to Figs. 2 to 8.    As shown in Fig. 2, the heat
   exchanger set includes sensible heat recovery heat exchanger (heat exchanger) 10,
20 latent heat recovery heat exchanger (housing) 20, and a sealing member 60.        In the
   present embodiment, sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 corresponds to a heat
   exchanger in the claims, and latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20 corresponds to a
   housing in the claims.
           As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 is arranged
25 on latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20 with sealing member 60 interposed
   therebetween.     In other words, sealing member 60 is sandwiched between sensible
   heat recovery heat exchanger 10 and latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20.        Sealing
   member 60 is formed in an annular shape.        Also, sealing member 60 is formed in a
   plate shape.    In addition, sealing member 60 does not have to be arranged between
                                                -7-

   sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 and latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20.
            As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 of the
   present embodiment mainly includes a case (first case) 11, a header 12, a heat transfer
   tube (heat absorption pipe) 13, a fin 16, a pressing member 17, and a fixing member 18.
 5 Heat transfer tube (heat absorption pipe) 13 and fin 16 that are arranged inside case 11
   constitute a heat exchange portion 15.
            Case 11 houses heat exchange portion 15.        Case 11 has a circumferential wall
   portion (first circumferential wall portion) 111, an upper opening 112, a lower opening
   (first opening) 113, and a flange portion (first flange portion) 114.     Case 11 has a first
10 sidewall 1 la, a second sidewall 1 Ib, a third sidewall 1 Ic, and a fourth sidewall I1d.
   First sidewall 11 a to fourth sidewall I1d are connected to one another so as to form a
   rectangular frame shape.      First sidewall 11 a to fourth sidewall I1d constitute
   circumferential wall portion 111.
            Case 11 having the above-described frame shape has upper opening 112 and
15 lower opening 113.      This allows combustion gas to be supplied to the inside of case 11
   through upper opening 112 of case 11.       This also allows combustion gas to be emitted
   through lower opening 113 of case 11 to the outside of case 11.
            Header 12 is provided on the outer surface of first sidewall 11a.     Header 12
   provided on the outer surface of first sidewall 11 a is provided with a joint 13a on the
20 water entry side and a joint 13b on the hot water exit side.     Header 12 (not shown) is
   provided also on the outer surface of third sidewall 1 Ic.
            Header 12 provided on the outer surface of first sidewall 11 a and header 12
   provided on the outer surface of third sidewall 11 c are connected to each other through
   a plurality of heat transfer tubes 13.   The plurality of heat transfer tubes 13 include
25 heat transfer tubes 13 located inside case 11 and heat transfer tubes 13 located outside
   case 11.
            Water and/or hot water flowing through header 12 and heat transfer tube 13 is,
   for example, as described below.
            Water and/or hot water introduced through joint 13a on the water entry side
                                                 -8-

   flows into heat transfer tube 13 located inside case 11 through header 12 provided on
   the side closest to one end of the outer surface of first sidewall 11 a.   Water and/or hot
   water having flown into heat transfer tube 13 reaches header 12 (not shown) provided
   on the outer surface of third sidewall 1Ic.    Water and/or hot water that reaches header
 5 12 provided on the outer surface of third sidewall 1Ic flows through another heat
   transfer tube 13 connected to this header 12 and reaches a header 12 provided on the
   outer surface of first sidewall 11a.   Thus, water and/or hot water flows from the side
   of first sidewall 11 a toward third sidewall 11 c and thereafter turns back from the side of
   third sidewall 11c toward first sidewall 11a.     Then, water and/or hot water flows while
10 repeating turning back toward third sidewall 1Ic and turning back toward first sidewall
   11a.
            Water and/or hot water that reaches header 12 provided on the side closest to
   the other end of the outer surface of first sidewall 11 a as described above reaches
   header 12 provided on the outer surface of third sidewall 1Ic through heat transfer tube
15 13 provided on the outer surface of second sidewall 1lb.       Water and/or hot water that
   reaches header 12 provided on the outer surface of third sidewall 1Ic flows through
   heat transfer tube 13 provided on the outer surface of fourth sidewall I1d and reaches
   header 12 provided on the outer surface of first sidewall 1la.      Finally, water and/or
   hot water exits from joint 13b on the hot water exit side.
20          As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, flange portion 114 is located above lower opening
   113 and extends outward from circumferential wall portion 111.         Circumferential wall
   portion 111 has a downwardly-extending wall portion 11w arranged at the lower end of
   circumferential wall portion 111.     Downwardly-extending wall portion 11w is
   arranged below flange portion 114.      Downwardly-extending wall portion 11w has a
25 lower end provided with lower opening 113.
            As shown in Fig. 5, flange portion 114 is provided around the entire
   circumference of circumferential wall portion 111.       Downwardly-extending wall
   portion 11w is provided on the entire circumference of circumferential wall portion 111.
   Downwardly-extending wall portion 11w is configured to have a rectangular frame
                                                -9-

   shape.
           As shown in Figs. 3 and 5, a plurality of fins 16 are connected to the outer
   circumferential surface of heat transfer tube 13 located inside case 11.    It is to be
   noted that Fig. 5 does not show fins for the sake of simplification of the description.
 5         Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20 mainly
   includes a case (second case) 21, a heat exchange portion 22, and a joint portion 23.
   Case 21 is connected to case 11.
           Case 21 has a circumferential wall portion (second circumferential wall portion)
   211, an upper opening (second opening) 212, a lower opening 213, a flange portion
10 (second flange portion) 214, a connection portion 215, a rising coupling portion 216, a
   through hole 217, and a main body portion 218.
           Case 21 houses heat exchange portion 22.        Circumferential wall portion 211 of
   case 21 is configured to surround the circumference of downwardly-extending wall
   portion 11w.    Circumferential wall portion 211 is configured to have a rectangular
15 frame shape.    Case 21 having the above-described frame shape has upper opening 212
   and lower opening 213.      This allows combustion gas to be supplied to the inside of
   case 21 through upper opening 212 of case 21.        This also allows combustion gas to be
   emitted to the outside of case 21 through lower opening 213 of case 21.
           Heat exchange portion 22 is to perform heat exchange between heating gas
20 flowing outside heat exchange portion 22 and water and/or hot water flowing inside
   heat exchange portion 22.      Heat exchange portion 22 has a plurality of heat transfer
   plates.   The plurality of heat transfer plates are stacked on one another.    The heat
   transfer plates adjacent to each other among the plurality of heat transfer plates are
   brazed to each other.    A gap between a pair of adjacent heat transfer plates of the
25 plurality of heat transfer plates defines a flow path through which water and/or hot
   water flows.    A space between a pair of adjacent heat transfer plates of the plurality of
   heat transfer plates defines a flow path through which combustion gas flows.
           A pair of joint portions 23 serves to cause water and/or hot water to flow
   therethrough into and out of the plurality of heat transfer plates in heat exchange
                                                - 10 -

   portion 22.     The pair of joint portions 23 each serves as a joint for connecting pipes.
   The pair of joint portions 23 each has a flow path that is connected to an internal flow
   path in each of the plurality of heat transfer plates.   Therefore, water and/or hot water
   introduced from joint portion 23 on the water entry side flows through the internal flow
 5 path in each of the pair of heat transfer plates, and thereafter, exits from joint portion 23
   on the hot water exit side.
            As shown in Figs. 4 and 6, flange portion 214 is arranged at the upper end of
   case 21.     Flange portion 214 is formed in an annular shape.     Flange portion 214
   extends from circumferential wall portion 211 to the outside of case 21.       Flange
10 portion 214 is connected to the upper end of circumferential wall portion 211.
   Circumferential wall portion 211 is arranged inside flange portion 214.       Upper
   opening 212 is provided at the upper end of circumferential wall portion 211.        Upper
   opening 212 is provided inside circumferential wall portion 211.        Sealing member 60
   is placed on flange portion 214.
15          Rising coupling portion 216 is arranged inside connection portion 215.       Rising
   coupling portion 216 rises upward from connection portion 215.          Through hole 217 is
   surrounded by rising coupling portion 216.       Main body portion 218 is inserted into
   through hole 217.      Main body portion 218 is configured to surround the circumference
   of heat exchange portion 22.       Rising coupling portion 216 is joined from outside to the
20 upper end of main body portion 218 inserted into through hole 217.
            As shown in Fig. 7, a first cutout portion 216a is provided at the upper end of
   rising coupling portion 216.      Accordingly, rising coupling portion 216 is low in height
   in first cutout portion 216a.    A second cutout portion 218a is provided at the upper end
   of main body portion 218.       Accordingly, the upper end of main body portion 218 is
25 low in height in second cutout portion 218a.
            In the state where the upper end of main body portion 218 is inserted into
   through hole 217, first cutout portion 216a is arranged so as to overlap with second
   cutout portion 218a.     Namely, first cutout portion 216a and second cutout portion
   218a are arranged so as to communicate with each other.
                                                - 11 -

            Through hole 217 is formed in a rectangular shape when flange portion 214 is
   seen from above.      First cutout portion 216a and second cutout portion 218a are
   provided at each of four comers of through hole 217.
            As shown in Figs. 3 and 8, flange portion 214 of case 21 in latent heat recovery
 5 heat exchanger 20 is connected to flange portion 114 of case 11 in sensible heat
   recovery heat exchanger 10.       Downwardly-extending wall portion 11w of case 11 is
   inserted through upper opening 212 of case 21 into the inside of circumferential wall
   portion 211.    In the state where downwardly-extending wall portion 11w of case 11 is
   arranged inside circumferential wall portion 211 of case 21, lower opening 113 of case
10 11 is located below the upper surface of flange portion 214 of case 21.       In the present
   embodiment, lower opening 113 of case 11 is located below the lower surface of flange
   portion 214 of case 21.
            Circumferential wall portion 111 of case 11 includes a plate member.
   Downwardly-extending wall portion 11w of circumferential wall portion 111 is formed
15 by folding the plate member at the lower end of circumferential wall portion 111.         In
   other words, downwardly-extending wall portion 11w is formed by folding one plate
   member.      Also, in the present embodiment, flange portion 114 is formed by bending
   one plate member.       In other words, in each of first sidewall 11a to fourth sidewall 1ld
   of case 11, circumferential wall portion 111, downwardly-extending wall portion 11w
20 and flange portion 114 are formed of one plate member.
            Downwardly-extending wall portion 11w of case 11 is arranged such that a gap
   is interposed between this downwardly-extending wall portion 11w of case 11 and
   circumferential wall portion 211 of case 21.      In other words, downwardly-extending
   wall portion 11w is not in close contact with circumferential wall portion 211.       A gap
25 between downwardly-extending wall portion 11w and circumferential wall portion 211
   is provided on the outside of circumferential wall portion 111.      In the present
   embodiment, the gap between downwardly-extending wall portion 11w and
   circumferential wall portion 211 is provided around the entire circumference of
   circumferential wall portion 111.
                                                - 12 -

           Connection portion 215 of case 21 is connected to the lower end of
   circumferential wall portion 211.     Connection portion 215 extends toward the inside
   of circumferential wall portion 211.     Connection portion 215 is arranged such that a
   gap is interposed between this connection portion 215 and the lower end of
 5 downwardly-extending wall portion 11w.         The gap between connection portion 215
   and the lower end of downwardly-extending wall portion 11w is provided directly
   below the lower end of downwardly-extending wall portion 11w.         The gap between
   downwardly-extending wall portion 11w and circumferential wall portion 211 is
   greater than the gap between downwardly-extending wall portion 11w and connection
10 portion 215.    In the present embodiment, connection portion 215 is inclined so as to be
   downwardly sloped toward the inside of circumferential wall portion 211.
           As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, in sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10, when
   the temperature of the water and/or hot water introduced into heat transfer tube 13 is
   relatively low, or when an amount of heating by burner 30 is relatively small, drainage
15 water is produced.     This drainage water flows from sensible heat recovery heat
   exchanger 10 into latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20.
           As shown in Figs. 3 and 8, the drainage water flowing from sensible heat
   recovery heat exchanger 10 into latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20 flows into heat
   exchange portion 22.     Specifically, as shown by arrows in Figs. 3 and 8, drainage
20 water produced in sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 flows along the inner
   surface of circumferential wall portion 111 of case 11 and drops from lower opening
   113 onto connection portion 215 of case 21.      This drainage water flows along the
   slope of connection portion 215 on the upper surface of connection portion 215
   obliquely downward to the inside of circumferential wall portion 211.     When drainage
25 water reaches rising coupling portion 216, this drainage water flows into heat exchange
   portion 22 through first cutout portion 216a and second cutout portion 218a.     The
   drainage water having flown into heat exchange portion 22 passes through heat
   exchange portion 22 and flows out from lower opening 213.
           Then, the functions and effects of the present embodiment will be hereinafter
                                               - 13 -

   described in comparison with a comparative example.
            Since the comparative example has the same configuration as that of the
   above-described present embodiment unless otherwise specified, the same components
   are designated by the same reference characters, and the description thereof will not be
 5 repeated.
            The comparative example will be hereinafter described with reference to Fig. 9.
   In the comparative example, the downwardly-extending wall portion of the present
   embodiment is not provided.     Thus, as shown by an arrow in Fig. 9, drainage water
   produced inside sensible heat recovery heat exchange 10 flows downward along the
10 inner surface of circumferential wall portion 111 of case 11.    When this drainage
   water flows to the lower end of circumferential wall portion 111, the drainage water
   may flow into between flange portion 114 of sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10
   and flange portion 214 of latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20.     Consequently, the
   drainage water may pass through between flange portion 114 of sensible heat recovery
15 heat exchanger 10 and flange portion 214 of latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20,
   and flow out from sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 and latent heat recovery
   heat exchanger 20.
            On the other hand, according to hot water apparatus 100 of the present
   embodiment, as shown in Fig. 8, in the state where downwardly-extending wall portion
20 11w is arranged on the inside of circumferential wall portion (first circumferential wall
   portion) 211, lower opening (first opening) 113 is located below the upper surface of
   flange portion (second flange portion) 214.      Accordingly, drainage water produced
   inside sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 moves along the inner surface of
   downwardly-extending wall portion 11w and flows downward from lower opening
25 (first opening) 113.   Thus, the drainage water can be suppressed from flowing onto the
   upper surface of flange portion (second flange portion) 214 located above lower
   opening (first opening) 113.    Thereby, the drainage water produced inside sensible
   heat recovery heat exchanger 10 can be suppressed from flowing out through between
   the lower surface of flange portion (first flange portion) 114 and the upper surface of
                                               - 14 -

   flange portion (second flange portion) 214.
            Furthermore, lower opening (first opening) 113 is located below the lower
   surface of flange portion (second flange portion) 214.      Accordingly, the distance from
   lower opening (first opening) 113 to the upper surface of flange portion (second flange
 5 portion) 214 in the vertical direction is greater than the distance from the upper surface
   of flange portion (second flange portion) 214 to the lower surface thereof in the vertical
   direction.   Thus, the drainage water produced inside sensible heat recovery heat
   exchanger 10 can be effectively suppressed from flowing through lower opening (first
   opening) 113 onto the upper surface of flange portion (second flange portion) 214.
10          Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 5, downwardly-extending wall portion 11w is
   provided around the entire circumference of circumferential wall portion (first
   circumferential wall portion) 111.    Thus, drainage water produced inside sensible heat
   recovery heat exchanger 10 can be suppressed from flowing through lower opening
   (first opening) 113 onto the upper surface of flange portion (second flange portion) 214
15 in the entire circumference of circumferential wall portion (first circumferential wall
   portion) 111.
            Also as shown in Fig. 8, downwardly-extending wall portion 11w is configured
   by folding a plate member at the lower end of circumferential wall portion (first
   circumferential wall portion) 111.    Thus, the drainage water produced inside sensible
20 heat recovery heat exchanger 10 can be prevented from flowing into the inside of
   downwardly-extending wall portion 11w from the lower end of circumferential wall
   portion (first circumferential wall portion) 111.    Accordingly, downwardly-extending
   wall portion 11w can be prevented from corroding from its inside due to drainage water.
            Furthermore, downwardly-extending wall portion 11w is arranged such that a
25 gap is interposed between downwardly-extending wall portion 11w and circumferential
   wall portion (second circumferential wall portion) 211.      Accordingly, drainage water
   produced inside sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 can be suppressed from
   flowing, due to surface tension, onto the upper surface of flange portion (second flange
   portion) 214 from lower opening (first opening) 113 through between
                                               - 15  -

   downwardly-extending wall portion 11w and circumferential wall portion (second
   circumferential wall portion) 211.
            Furthermore, the gap between downwardly-extending wall portion 11w and
   circumferential wall portion (second circumferential wall portion) 211 is greater than
 5 the gap between downwardly-extending wall portion 11w and connection portion 215.
   Accordingly, drainage water produced inside sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10
   is likely to flow more into the gap between downwardly-extending wall portion 11w
   and connection portion 215 than into the gap between downwardly-extending wall
   portion 11w and circumferential wall portion (second circumferential wall portion) 211.
10 Thus, drainage water can be suppressed from flowing through between
   downwardly-extending wall portion 11w and circumferential wall portion (second
   circumferential wall portion) 211.    Thereby, the drainage water produced inside
   sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 can be suppressed from flowing onto the
   upper surface of flange portion (second flange portion) 214 through between
15 downwardly-extending wall portion 11w and circumferential wall portion (second
   circumferential wall portion) 211.
            Furthermore, connection portion 215 is inclined so as to be downwardly sloped
   toward the inside of circumferential wall portion (second circumferential wall portion)
   211.    Thereby, the drainage water produced inside sensible heat recovery heat
20 exchanger 10 flows along the inner surface of connection portion 215 toward the inside
   of circumferential wall portion (second circumferential wall portion) 211.     Thus, the
   drainage water can be suppressed from flowing toward flange portion (second flange
   portion) 214.    Accordingly, the drainage water produced inside sensible heat recovery
   heat exchanger 10 can be suppressed from flowing onto the upper surface of flange
25 portion (second flange portion) 214.    Furthermore, when latent heat recovery heat
   exchanger 20 is entirely inclined to the outside of circumferential wall portion (second
   circumferential wall portion) 211, the drainage water adhering to connection portion
   215 can be suppressed from flowing toward flange portion (second flange portion) 214.
            As shown in Fig. 7, rising coupling portion 216 is joined from outside to the
                                              - 16 -

   upper end of main body portion 218.        Accordingly, rising coupling portion 216 can be
   readily welded to the upper end of main body portion 218.
           Furthermore, first cutout portion 216a provided at the upper end of rising
   coupling portion 216 is arranged so as to overlap with second cutout portion 218a
 5 provided at the upper end of main body portion 218.        Accordingly, drainage water can
   be caused to flow from first cutout portion 216a and second cutout portion 218a into
   through hole 217.     Thereby, drainage water can be readily discharged.
           (Second Embodiment)
           Since the second embodiment of the present invention has the same
10 configuration as that of the above-described first embodiment of the present invention
   unless otherwise specified, the same components are designated by the same reference
   characters, and the description thereof will not be repeated.
           The above-described first embodiment has been explained with regard to the
   situation where sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 corresponds to a heat
15 exchanger in the claims, and latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20 corresponds to a
   housing in the claims.     In contrast, in the present embodiment, latent heat recovery
   heat exchanger 20 corresponds to a heat exchanger in the claims, and exhaust collection
   and guide member 70 corresponds to a housing in the claims.
           As shown in Figs. 10 and 11, latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20 is arranged
20 on exhaust collection and guide member 70 with a sealing member 80 interposed
   therebetween.    In other words, sealing member 80 is sandwiched between latent heat
   recovery heat exchanger 20 and exhaust collection and guide member 70.           In addition,
   sealing member 80 does not have to be arranged between latent heat recovery heat
   exchanger 20 and exhaust collection and guide member 70.
25         Latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20 has a case (first case) 21 provided with
   a flange portion (first flange portion) 219.     Flange portion 219 is located above lower
   opening (first opening) 213 and extends outward from main body portion (first
   circumferential wall portion) 218.      Main body portion 218 has a
   downwardly-extending wall portion 21w arranged at the lower end of main body
                                                 - 17 -

   portion 218.
            Exhaust collection and guide member 70 mainly has a case (second case) 71
   and a partition plate 72.   Case 71 is connected to case 21 of latent heat recovery heat
   exchanger 20.     Case 71 has a circumferential wall portion (second circumferential
 5 wall portion) 711, an upper opening (second opening) 712, a connection opening 713,
   and a flange portion (second flange portion) 714.
            Circumferential wall portion 711 of case 71 is arranged on the outside of
   downwardly-extending wall portion 21w.         Combustion gas can be supplied to the
   inside of case 71 through upper opening 712 of case 71.      Also, combustion gas can be
10 emitted to duct 33 through connection opening 713 of case 71.
            Flange portion 714 is arranged at the upper end of case 71.   Flange portion 714
   extends from circumferential wall portion 711 to the outside of case 71.     Flange
   portion 714 is connected to the upper end of circumferential wall portion 711.
   Circumferential wall portion 711 is arranged on the inside of flange portion 714.
15 Upper opening 712 is provided at the upper end of circumferential wall portion 711.
   Upper opening 712 is provided on the inside of circumferential wall portion 711.
   Connection opening 713 is connected to duct 33.       Sealing member 80 is placed on
   flange portion 714.
            Flange portion 714 of case 71 is connected to flange portion 214 of case 21 in
20 latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20.     Downwardly-extending wall portion 21w of
   case 21 is inserted into the inside of circumferential wall portion 711 through upper
   opening 712 of case 71.     In the state where downwardly-extending wall portion 21w
   of case 21 is arranged on the inside of circumferential wall portion 711 of case 71,
   lower opening 213 of case 21 is located below the upper surface of flange portion 714
25 of case 71.   In the present embodiment, lower opening 213 of case 21 is located below
   the lower surface of flange portion 714 of case 71.
            Downwardly-extending wall portion 21w of case 21 is arranged such that a gap
   is interposed between downwardly-extending wall portion 21w and circumferential
   wall portion 711 of case 71.     The gap between downwardly-extending wall portion
                                               - 18 -

   21w and circumferential wall portion 711 is provided on the outside of circumferential
   wall portion 711.
            Case 71 houses a partition plate 72.     Partition plate 72 is arranged below heat
   exchange portion 22.     Partition plate 72 is provided with a plurality of holes 72a.
 5 Combustion gas having flown into exhaust collection and guide member 70 from latent
   heat recovery heat exchanger 20 flows through the plurality of holes 72a into duct 33.
   Furthermore, the drainage water having flown into exhaust collection and guide
   member 70 from latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20 is discharged through the
   plurality of holes 72a from an exhaust port 71 a provided in the lower surface of case 71.
10          Then, the functions and effects of the present embodiment will be hereinafter
   described.
            According to hot water apparatus 100 of the present embodiment, drainage
   water produced inside latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20 flows along the inner
   surface of downwardly-extending wall portion 21w downward from lower opening
15 (first opening) 213.   Accordingly, the drainage water can be suppressed from flowing
   onto the upper surface of flange portion (second flange portion) 714 located above
   lower opening (first opening) 213.      Thereby, the drainage water produced inside latent
   heat recovery heat exchanger 20 can be suppressed from flowing through between the
   lower surface of flange portion (first flange portion) 214 and the upper surface of
20 flange portion (second flange portion) 714.
            Furthermore, lower opening (first opening) 213 is located below the lower
   surface of flange portion (second flange portion) 714.       Accordingly, the distance from
   lower opening (first opening) 213 to the upper surface of flange portion (second flange
   portion) 714 in the vertical direction is greater than the distance from the upper surface
25 of flange portion (second flange portion) 714 to the lower surface thereof in the vertical
   direction.   Thus, the drainage water produced inside latent heat recovery heat
   exchanger 20 can be effectively suppressed from flowing through lower opening (first
   opening) 213 onto the upper surface of flange portion (second flange portion) 714.
            Furthermore, downwardly-extending wall portion 21w is arranged such that a
                                               -  19  -

   gap is interposed between downwardly-extending wall portion 21w and circumferential
   wall portion (second circumferential wall portion) 711.   Accordingly, the drainage
   water produced inside latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20 can be suppressed from
   flowing, due to surface tension, from lower opening (first opening) 213 through
 5 between downwardly-extending wall portion 21w and circumferential wall portion
   (second circumferential wall portion) 711 onto the upper surface of flange portion
   (second flange portion) 714.

   above, it should be understood that the embodiments disclosed herein are illustrative
10 and non-restrictive in every respect.  The scope of the present invention is defined by
