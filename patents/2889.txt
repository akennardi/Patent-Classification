DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0082]               FIG. 1 discloses a shopping cart 10. The shopping cart 10 includes a frame
14, a basket assembly 18, a handle 22, a rear gate 26, a lower tray 30, and multiple
wheels 34 supporting the frame 14 for movement over the ground. In the embodiment
shown in FIGS. 1-4, the frame 14 forms a U-shaped member including a base 38,
                                                      9
10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

uprights or arms 42 extending upwardly from the base 38, and a cover 46 connected to
each arm 42. As best shown in FIG. 4, each arm 42 includes an upper end 50 positioned
away from the base 38. The arms 42 taper inwardly from the upper ends 50, such that
the distance between the arms 42 proximate the base 38 is less than the distance between
the upper ends 50 of the arms 42. The cart 10 defines a front end 52, a rear end 54
opposite the front end 52, and a horizontal cart axis 56 extending between the front end
52 and the rear end 54. As used herein, the term "rearward" refers to a direction that
extends toward the rear end 54, and the term "forward" refers to a direction that extends
toward a front end 52.
[0083]               The frame 14 is formed by a combination of over-molding and gas-assist
plastic forming processes. As shown in FIG. 5A, a substrate 58 such as a piece of metal
is over-molded by plastic material 60. Although the substrate 58 in FIG. 5A has a cross
section that is U-shaped, the substrate 58 can be formed into various other shapes,
including a round tube (FIG. 5B) or an enclosed piece that is partially hexagonal and
partially rectangular (FIG. 5C). In the illustrated embodiments, the plastic material 60
near the substrate 58 is molded as a lattice structure having ribs 62 for increased rigidity.
In one embodiment, the substrate 58 is made from steel, although in other embodiments
the substrate could be made from another material. The plastic material 60 may include
any type of injection-molded plastic. The gas-assist process creates at least one hollow
cavity (not shown) in the plastic material 60. This combination process yields a frame
 14 that is both strong and low weight. The substrate 58 and the geometric relationship
between the substrate 58 and the plastic 60 increases rigidity over a simple injection
molded plastic. The combination process satisfies the load and durability standards, is
less expensive than conventional glass-filled nylon processes, and provides a frame 14
having a lower density than the glass-filled nylon frames. In one embodiment, a frame
 14 made using the combination process costs about $0.60 per pound and has a lower
density, whereas a frame made from glass-filled nylon costs about $2 per pound and has
a higher density.

[00841               Referring to FIG. 2, the basket assembly 18 is removably coupled to the
frame 14 and includes a basket frame 74 and a pair of slots 78 on either side of the
basket frame 74. The slots 78 receive the upper ends 50 of the arms 42. The walls and
bottom surface of the basket assembly 18 have been removed for purposes of clarity; the
basket assembly 18 also includes basket walls similar to those shown in FIGS. 12-13 and
FIG. 22. The basket assembly 18 is moved onto the arms 42 and slides down along the
arms 42 until the basket assembly 18 reaches a predetermined position. In the illustrated
embodiment, the predetermined position is the point at which the slots 78 engage the
arms 42 in an interference fit due to the inward taper of the arms 42.               In other
embodiments, the predetermined position may be defined by a detent that locks the
basket assembly 18 in place relative to the arms 42, or the basket assembly 18 may be
secured relative to the arms 42 by fasteners.
[00851               Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the handle 22 includes a generally U-shaped
member having two ends 86 that are adapted to engage the upper ends 50 of the arms 42.
After the basket assembly 18 is secured relative to the frame 14, the handle 22 is coupled
to the upper ends 50 of the arms 42, further locking the basket assembly 18 in position.
The handle 22 also includes a pair of openings 90 (FIG. 2), each of which is positioned
proximate one of the handle ends 86. In the illustrated embodiment, the handle ends 86
are secured to the arms 42 by a snap fit or interference fit.
[00861               The rear gate 26 includes a wall 94 and a pair of gate arms 98 and is
positioned proximate the rearward end of the cart 10. The gate arms 98 are positioned
on opposite edges of the wall 94 and extends away from the wall 94. In the embodiment
shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, each gate arm 98 is positioned within one of the openings 90 on
the handle 22. The rear gate 26 is thus pivotably coupled to the handle 22 and pivots
about a gate axis 100 transverse to the cart axis 56. When a second cart (not shown) is
pushed into the rear of the shopping cart 10, the rear gate 26 pivots upwardly, toward the
front of the basket assembly 18 in order to enable the basket assembly of the second cart
to nest within the basket assembly 18.            In other embodiments, the gate arms 98 may
engage openings positioned on the basket assembly 18. The rear gate 26 engages a stop
                                                    11
10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

 102 (FIG. 7A) positioned on the basket assembly 18 to prevent the rear gate 26 from
pivoting beyond the rearward end of the basket frame 74, i.e., to limit pivoting of the
rear gate 26 in a clockwise direction as shown in FIG. 7A.
[00871               The frame 14 is capable of supporting multiple types of basket assemblies
 18.     For example, in an alternative embodiment shown in FIGS. 6-8, a second basket
assembly 218 includes multiple basket frames 274 having different                      sizes and
characteristics from the first basket assembly 18.           The basket assembly of FIGS. 6-8
includes a first or lower basket 274a and a second or upper basket 274b. In addition, the
handle 222 is pivotably coupled to blocks 224 that are coupled to the arms 242. In the
illustrated embodiment, the handle 222 is formed as a U-shaped member that is
pivotably coupled to the cart 10 at each end 286. The handle 222 is pivotable about a
handle axis 228 (FIG. 7B) transverse to the cart axis 256. In other embodiments, the
handle 222 may be coupled to the basket assembly 218 or the handle axis 228 may be
oriented in a different direction.
[0088]               Referring to FIG. 7B, the upper basket 274b is substantially above the lower
basket 274a. The lower basket 274a includes a first or lower gate 226a proximate the
rear end 254 of the cart 210. The lower gate 226a is pivotable about a lower gate axis
300a transverse to the cart axis 256 between a raised position and a lowered position.
The lower gate 226a is similar to the rear gate 26 described above with respect to FIGS.
 1 and 2. The lower gate 226a includes a wall 294a and a pair of arms 298a for coupling
the lower gate 226a to the lower basket 274a.                The wall 294a extends across the
rearward end of the lower basket 274a when the lower gate 226a is in the lowered
position. As shown in FIG. 7A, the wall 294a has an upper end 296 below an upper end
276 of the lower basket 274a when the lower gate 226a is in the lowered position.
[0089]               As shown in FIG. 7B, the upper basket 274b includes a second or upper gate
226b proximate the rear end 254 of the cart 210. The upper gate 226b is pivotable about
an upper gate axis 300b transverse to the cart axis 256 between a raised position and a
lowered position. The upper gate 226b includes a wall 294b (FIG. 7B) and a pair of
                                                    12
10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

arms 298b for coupling the upper gate 226b to the upper basket 274b. The wall 294b
extends across a rearward end of the upper basket 274b when the upper gate 226b is in a
lowered position. Both the lower gate 226a and the upper gate 226b pivot upwardly
toward the front of each basket 274a, 274b to allow the lower basket 274a and the upper
basket 274b to receive a lower basket and upper basket, respectively, of another cart (not
shown). The stops 102 (FIG. 7A) prevent the gates 226a, 226b from pivoting backward
beyond the rearward end of each basket 274a, 274b.
[0090]               The lower basket 274a is configured to be loaded from the rear. As best
illustrated in FIGS. 7A and 7B, the lower basket 274a is positioned partially behind the
upper basket 274b, enabling a user to load and unload the lower basket 274a from
behind the cart 210 and beneath the handle 222. Stated another way, a rearward end of
the upper basket 274b is positioned forward of a rearward end of the lower basket 274a
to provide easy access to the contents of the lower basket 274a from the rear of the cart
210. In addition, because the upper end 296 of the wall 294a is below the upper end 276
of the lower basket 274a when the lower gate 226a is in the lowered position, it is easier
for a user to load and unload the lower basket 274a.
[0091]               The handle 222 is moveable about the handle axis 228 between at least a
first or rear position (FIG. 6) and a second or forward position (FIG. 7A). As shown in
FIG. 6, in the rear position the handle 222 extends toward the rear end 254 of the cart
210.        This configuration allows the user to push the cart 210 with the handle 222.
Referring to FIG. 7B, in the forward position the handle 222 extends toward the front
end 252 of the cart 210. In the forward position, the handle 222 is substantially aligned
with the upper gate 226b (see FIG. 7B) and forward of the rearward end of the lower
basket 274a. This position of the handle 222 improves access to the lower basket 274a,
allowing the user to more easily load or unload the lower basket 274a from the rear. The
frame 14 is configured to support many types of basket assemblies 18, so the
manufacturer can select a basket assembly 18 from multiple types of basket assemblies
 18 in order to customize the cart 10 as necessary. This reduces the need to manufacture
                                                  13
10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

many types of carts 10 individually, instead providing a modular approach for
manufacturing the carts 10 from similar parts.
[0092]               In other embodiments, shown in FIG. 9, multiple basket assemblies 418 may
be positioned on the arms 442, including one or more rear-facing baskets 474c. In this
embodiment, the handle 422 includes ends 486 that are coupled to the arms 442 by
fasteners such as bolts. Alternatively, as shown in FIGS. 10-11, the arms 642 can be
removably received on the frame 614, and the basket assemblies 618 include brackets
620 for coupling each basket assembly 618 to the arms 642. The bracket 620 can be
secured to the arms 642 by a snap fit or by fasteners. The alternative embodiments of
FIGS. 12-14 also illustrate that the basket assembly 818 can be directly fastened to the
frame 814, and the handle 822 may be formed integrally with the basket assembly 818
or the frame 814. In addition, FIG. 13 shows a cart 810 in which the lower tray 830
includes an open-ended basket.
[00931               As shown in FIGS. 15-17, the frame 14 is formed in a mold 106. The mold
includes a removable first module or insert 110. In the illustrated embodiment, the first
insert 110 forms a portion of the frame base 38. The first insert 110 may be removed
from the mold 106 and replaced with a second insert 114 that forms the same portion of
the base 38, but the portion of the base 38 has a shorter dimension than the portion that
is formed by the first insert 110. In other embodiments, the second insert 114 could
provide a different shape for the portion of the base 38. In still other embodiments, the
inserts 110, 114 could form a different portion of the frame 14 or another component of
the cart 10. The removable inserts 110, 114 enable the operator to readily customize the
size and shape of the manufactured frame 14 by changing the configuration of the mold
 106. Because the mold 106 is capable of producing various frame configurations, the
forming process requires only a single large mold 106 with several smaller inserts like
the first insert 110 and second insert 114, rather than multiple large molds for each
desired configuration. In this way, tooling costs are reduced.
                                                   14
10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

[00941               As shown in FIGS. 18-21, the frame 14 also includes a caster lift mechanism
 122 to raise the wheels 34 when the cart 10 is nested or stacked with another cart. The
caster lift mechanism 122 includes a ridge 126 formed on an upper surface 130 of the
base 38, a housing 134 formed on an inside surface 138 of at least one of the arms 42,
and an insert 142 (FIG. 19) positioned within the housing 134 and behind the cover 46.
In one embodiment, the insert 142 is made of a wear-resistant plastic material. In the
illustrated embodiment the housing 134 extends inwardly or toward the center of the
base 38 and forms a cylindrical recess 146. The recess 146 is open at the inner end of
the housing 134 and the housing 134 has a longitudinal slot 150 communicating with the
bottom of the recess 146. The insert 142 is cylindrical and is inserted into the inner end
of the recess 146 such that the lower portion of the insert 142 extends through the slot
 150. Referring to FIG. 21, when a second cart is nested into the rear of a first cart 10,
the insert 142 from the first cart 10 engages the ridge 126 and causes the rear of the first
cart 10 to lift away from the ground. Lifting the rear end of the cart 10 insures that the
rear wheels 34 do not contact the ground, thereby reducing the friction between the
nested carts 10 and the ground. This reduced contact makes it easier for the nested carts
 10 to be pushed and maneuvered together. Over time, the repeated engagement between
the ridge 126 and the insert 142 will cause the insert 142 to wear down. The insert 142
provides a replaceable wear surface such that once the insert 142 wears down to a
predetermined point, the user can replace the insert 142 to extend the working life of the
caster lift mechanism 122.
[0095]               In an alternative embodiment, shown in FIG. 22, the cart 1210 includes a
basket frame 1274, a bottom surface 1276, and multiple walls 1280. The basket frame
 1274 is configured to support multiple types of basket walls 1280 that can be removably
coupled to the basket frame 1274. In one embodiment, the basket frame 1274 is molded
separately from the walls 1280, and the walls 1280 are coupled to the basket frame 1274
by a snap fit. In other embodiments the walls 1280 are coupled by fasteners. The basket
frame 1274 is configured to support many types of basket walls 1280, so the
manufacturer can select a basket wall 1280 from many basket wall types in order to
                                                   15
10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

customize the cart as necessary. For instance, various walls 1280 may define different
mesh patterns or wall cross-sections. This reduces the need to manufacture many types
of baskets individually. Instead, the manufacturer can create the same basic frame 1274
and then select a particular wall 1280, thereby implementing a modular approach to
manufacturing the basket frames 1274 from similar parts.
[0096]               The wall 1280 of the basket frame 1274 may also include one or more
billboard panels 1284 for displaying graphics or other information. The panels 1284 can
be molded with an in-mold graphic foil 1288 (FIG. 23) and changed as desired (for
example, seasonally).               FIGS. 23A-23D provide various examples of billboard panels
 1284. As shown in FIG. 23A, the graphic foil 1288 may be slidably received through
the basket frame 1274 and positioned within the billboard panel 1284. Alternatively,
FIGS. 23B and 23C show that the panel 1284 may include a transparent window 1292
that is pivotable relative to the basket frame 1274 to allow the graphic foil 1288 to be
positioned behind the window 1292. The panel 1284 may also be removably fitted
within the basket frame 1274, as shown in FIG. 23D.
[00971               FIG. 24 shows a nesting flat-bed cart 1610. The flat-bed cart 1610 includes
a frame 1614, a pivoting load bed or deck 1616, at least one spring-loaded slow-close
hinge 1620, and a latch mechanism 1624. In one embodiment, the deck 1616 is made
from a non-slip plastic material. The frame 1614 includes a base 1628 having a handle
 1622, multiple wheels or casters 1634 coupled to the base for supporting movement of
the frame over the ground, and a cross piece 1636. In the illustrated embodiment, the
rear wheels 1634 can swivel, while the front wheels 1634 are fixed. The frame 1614
defines a longitudinal axis 1640. The deck 1616 includes a hand grip 1644 and a ribbed
underside 1648 (FIG. 27) to provide increased rigidity.
[00981               The deck 1616 is pivotably attached to the base 1638 by the spring-loaded
slow-close hinge 1620. The deck is pivotable about a pivot axis 1652 transverse to the
longitudinal axis 1640. The slow-close hinge 1620 is similar to those used for toilet
seats. The spring action of the hinge 1620 biases the deck 1616 toward an upright
                                                    16
10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

position as shown in FIG. 24. The latch mechanism 1624 is located on the cross piece
 1636 extending between the front wheels 1634.              When the deck 1616 is moved to a
lowered or use position, the latch mechanism 1624 locks the deck 1616.                      In one
embodiment, the latch mechanism 1624 includes a rotating hook (not shown). The hook
may be spring-biased to automatically engage and lock the deck 1616 in place when the
deck 1616 is moved to the lowered position.                When the latch mechanism 1624 is
unlocked, the slow-close hinge 1620 moves the deck 1616 to the upright position. The
hand grip 1644 enables the user to assist in lifting the deck 1616 to the upright position.
In other embodiments, a heavy spring or gas strut may be used in addition to or in place
of the slow-close hinge 1620.
[0099]               With the decks 1616 in the upright position, multiple flat-bed carts 1610 can
be stacked or nested together in a manner similar to the cart 10 of FIG. 1. That is, the
frame of a second flat-bed cart 1610 can be pushed into the first flat-bed cart 1610 from
the rear, such that the frames 1614 of the two carts 1610 nest together The flat-bed cart
 1610 of FIG. 24 can be made with a frame 1614 that is similar to the frame 14 of FIG. 1
except with a different handle. In addition, the flat-bed cart 1610 of FIG. 24 can include
the caster lift mechanism 122 described above with respect to FIGS. 18-21.                   In the
embodiment shown in FIG. 25, the flat-bed cart 1610 further includes a small basket
 1618 that can be removably attached to the handle 1622, such as by a snap fit or by
fasteners. The basket 1618 may also be integrally formed with the handle 1622 or frame
 1614.
[00100]              FIGS. 26-27 disclose a nesting flat-bed cart 1810 with a folding deck 1816.
The flat-bed cart 1810 of FIGS. 26-27 is similar to the flat-bed cart 1610 of FIG. 24,
except that it is designed to support greater weights or loads. The deck 1816 includes a
first or rear section 1844 pivotably coupled to the frame 1814, and a second or front
section 1848 pivotably connected to the rear section 1844 by a hinge 1852. The deck
 1816 folds along a lateral break line that is transverse to the longitudinal axis 1840 of the
frame 1814, in a manner similar to a folding banquet table. The deck 1816 can pivot
about the hinge 1852 when in a lowered position, which allows the flat-bed cart 1810 to
                                                    17
10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

accommodate bumps or rough surfaces over which the cart 1810 travels.                       In the
illustrated embodiment, the front section 1848 and rear section 1844 include at least one
hand grip 1856 for moving the deck 1816 between the upright and lowered positions,
and the front section 1848 includes one or more casters 1860. In one embodiment, a
single caster 1856 is used for supporting up to 2000 pounds and two casters 1856 are
used for supporting up to 3000 pounds.
[00101]              FIGS. 28 and 29 show another embodiment of the shopping cart 2010. The
shopping cart 2010 includes a frame 2014, a first or upper basket 2018, a second or
lower basket 2022, a handle assembly 2026 for pushing the cart 2010, a tray 2030
supported on the frame 2014, and multiple wheels 2034 supporting the frame 2014 for
movement over the ground. The cart 2010 defines a front end, a rear end opposite the
front end, and a horizontal cart axis 2050 (FIG. 28) extending between the front end and
the rear end. As used herein, the term "rearward" refers to a direction that extends
toward the rear end, and the term "forward" refers to a direction that extends toward the
front end.
[00102]              In the illustrated embodiment, substantially all of the components of the cart
2010 (i.e., except for the wheel axles and pins coupling the front wheels 2034a to the
frame 2014) are made from a plastic material, and are preferably injection-molded. In
the illustrated embodiment, frame 2014 and handle assembly 2026 are formed from
polycarbonate polyethylene, while the baskets 2018, 2022 and tray 2030 are formed
from high-density polyethylene.               In other embodiments, the frame 2014, handle
assembly 2026, the baskets 2018, 2022, and the tray 2030 may be formed from the same
material. In addition, other plastic materials may be used.
[00103]              The frame 2014 includes a base 2058 and a pair of upright members 2062 on
either side of the cart 2010 to support the baskets 2018, 2022.                  In the illustrated
embodiment, the uprights members 2062 are formed integrally with the base 2058. The
base 2058 is generally U-shaped. The base 2058 includes a front member 2056 to which
the front wheels 2034a are coupled and parallel sides extending between the front
                                                    18
10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

member 2056 and the upright members 2062. The base 2058 is substantially parallel to
the ground or support surface and supports the tray 2030. In the illustrated embodiment,
the frame 2014 also includes a cross-member 2070 extending between the upright
members 2062. In the illustrated embodiment, each upright member 2062 has a chevron
or "boomerang" shape. In other embodiments, the upright members 2062 may be
straight. The frame 2014 also includes a protrusion 2066 extending inwardly from an
inner surface of each upright member 2062 and toward the center axis 2050 of the cart
2010. The protrusion 2066 is positioned to engage a second cart when the second cart is
nested with the cart 2010, lifting a rear portion of the cart 2010 away from the ground.
The protrusion 2066 is similar to the cart lifting mechanism described above with
respect to FIGS. 18-21.
[00104]              Referring to FIGS. 30 and 31, the front member 2056 of the base 2058
includes a pair of slots 2086 proximate the front wheels 2034a. The tray 2030 includes a
pair of tabs 2090 that engage the slots 2086. To couple the tray 2030 to the base 2058,
the tray 2030 is tilted into engagement with the base 2058 such that the tabs 2090 are
inserted into the slots 2086. Stated another way, the tray 2030 is oriented at an acute
angle relative to the base 2058 and moved forward to insert the tabs 2090 into the slots
2086. The tray 2030 is then pivoted downwardly (counterclockwise in FIG. 31) about
the slots 2086 so that the tray 2030 rests on the base 2058.                    In the illustrated
embodiment, the tabs 2090 engage the slots 2086 by a snap fit. As best shown in FIG.
32, the tray 2030 includes projections 2094 that are received within recesses 2098 on the
frame 2014.                  In the illustrated embodiment, the projections 2094 extend laterally
outward toward the sides of the cart 2010 and the recesses 2098 are open on the top. As
the tray 2030 pivots downwardly, the projections 2094 are received within the recesses
2098, thereby releasably securing the tray 2030 against forward or rearward movement
relative to the frame 2014. To remove the tray 2030, the rear end of the tray 2030 is first
pivoted upwardly (clockwise in FIG. 31) to remove the projections 2094 from the
recesses 2098. The tray 2030 is then moved away from the front edge of the base 2058
to remove the tabs 2090 from the slots 2086. This arrangement makes it highly unlikely
                                                       19
10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

the tray 2030 will accidentally come off the base 2058. In other embodiments, the slots
2086 and/or the recesses 2098 may be formed on the tray 2030, while the tabs 2090
and/or the projections 2094 may be formed on the frame 2014.
[00105]              As shown in FIG. 33, the upper basket 2018 includes a rear gate 2106 and a
pair of mounting portions 2110. The lower basket 2022 includes a rear gate 2114 and a
pair of mounting portions 2118. The rear gate 2114 has a U-shape to facilitate loading
the lower basket 2022 from the rear. In the illustrated embodiment, the upper basket
2018 is coupled to the handle assembly 2026 and the rear gate 2110 is pivotably coupled
to the handle assembly 2026 as further described below. In other embodiments, the rear
gate 2110 is coupled to the basket 2018.              The rear gates 2106, 2114 are upwardly
pivotable in order to receive an upper basket and lower basket, respectively, of another
cart similar to the shopping cart 2010 so that the carts can be nested.
[00106]              Referring to FIG. 34, the mounting portions 2110, 2118 engage the upright
members 2062 to removably couple the baskets 2018, 2022, respectively, to the frame
2014. Each mounting portion 2110 of the upper basket 2018 includes a generally flat
surface 2126 and a stop 2130. Each mounting portion 2118 of the lower basket 2022
includes a generally flat surface 2134, a stop 2138, and tabs or ribs or fingers 2142
protruding from the surface 2134.
[00107]              As shown in FIGS. 33 and 34, each upright member 2062 includes an upper
end 2146, a lower end 2150 (FIG. 33) supported by rear wheels 2034b and a track 2154
extending along an inner surface of the upright member 2062. The flat surfaces 2134 of
the lower basket 2022 slidably engage the inner surfaces of the upright members 2062
such that the fingers 2142 slide within the tracks 2154.             Each track 2154 includes
complementary ribs or fingers 2162 that slide between the fingers 2142. As best shown
in FIG. 34, each inner surface of the upright members 2162 also includes a first opening
2170 to engage the stop 2138 and a second opening 2174 to engage the stop 2130. In
other embodiments, the fingers 2142 may be coupled to the upright members 2062 and
the tracks 2154 may be coupled to the basket 2022.

10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

[00108]              To assemble the cart 2010, the flat surfaces 2134 of the lower basket 2022
first slide along the inner surfaces of the upright members 2062 until the stop 2138
engages a lower edge of the first opening 2170 and the complementary fingers 2162
engage the fingers 2142 of the lower basket 2022, thereby securing the basket 2022
relative to the frame 2014. Next, the flat surfaces 2126 of the upper basket 2018 slide
along the inner surfaces of the upright members 2062 until the stop 2130 engages a
lower edge of the second opening 2174, coupling the upper basket 2018 to the upright
members 2062 above the lower basket 2022.
[00109]              Next, the handle assembly 2026 is coupled to the upright members 2062. As
shown in FIG. 33, the handle assembly 2026 includes a pair of brackets 2178 that are
coupled to the upper ends 2146. Each bracket 2178 includes an opening that is aligned
with an opening 2180 (FIG. 34) on the upper basket 2018 and an opening 2181 on the
upright member 2062.                   As shown in FIG. 35, a pin 2183 is then inserted into each
opening of the bracket 2178 and the openings 2180, 2181 to releasably secure the basket
2018 and the handle assembly 2026 to the upright members 2062. The rear gate 2106
includes pins 2182 that extend into openings 2184 in the handle assembly 2026 so that
the rear gate 2106 pivots relative to the handle assembly 2026.                 When the handle
assembly 2026 is positioned on the upper basket 2018, the openings 2184 of the handle
assembly 2026 are aligned with openings on the upper basket 2018. A cap (not shown)
is inserted into the openings of the upper basket 2018 and the handle assembly 2026 and
engages the pin 2182 of the rear gate 2106 to couple the rear gate 2106 to both the
handle assembly 2026 and the upper basket 2018.
[00110]              Referring to FIGS. 36 and 37, a cover 2186 is removably coupled to an outer
surface of each upright member 2062 to provide access to an area within the upright
member 2062.                     The cover 2186 includes projections 2190 that engage lugs 2158
positioned on an outer surface of each upright member 262.                    In the embodiment
illustrated in FIG. 37, some of the projections 2190 are formed as hooks 2190a that are
inserted into loops 2158a by moving the cover 2186 vertically relative to the upright
                                                       21
10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

member 2062, while other projections 2190 have openings 2190b that receive tabs
2158b by a snap fit.
[00111]              As shown in FIG. 38, the handle assembly 2026 includes a bar 2198 and
accessory holders 2202. In the illustrated embodiment, the bar 2198 is contoured such
that portions of the bar 2198 proximate the sides of the cart 2010 are angled forward and
a center portion extending between the side portions is transverse to the cart axis 2050.
The angled shape of the bar 2198 improves ergonomic comfort for the user. In addition,
positioning the center portion forward of the side portions permits better access to the
lower basket 2022 and facilitates lifting a child from the ground over the handle
assembly 2026 and into the upper basket 2018. In another embodiment, shown in FIG.
39, the handle assembly 2026 may be formed as a first handle portion 2026a and a
second handle portion 2026b spaced apart from the first handle portion 2026a such that
there is no center portion. The spaced apart handles 2026a and 2026b facilitate access to
the lower basket 2022 and facilitate lifting a child into the upper basket 2018.
[00112]              Referring again to FIG. 38, the accessory holders 2202 include round
openings 2206 positioned on either side of the cart 2010 for supporting a cup, a lateral
slot 2210 for supporting an electronic device (such as a tablet computer or a cellular
phone), and hooks 2214 positioned forward of the bar 2198 for supporting a hanging
article, such as a garment or handbag. The slot 2210 is positioned between the openings
2206 and oriented transverse to the cart axis 2050. A notebook or electronic device can
be positioned in a rearward-facing orientation so that a screen of the electronic device is
visible to a user pushing the cart 2010. The slot 2210 includes an internal projection
2218 for engaging a lower portion of the electronic device and preventing the device
from being jostled out of the slot 2210 as the user pushes the cart 2010.                  In other
embodiments, the slot 2210 may be adapted so that a device can be positioned in a
forward-facing orientation so that the screen is visible to person positioned within the
upper basket 2018.                  In the illustrated embodiments, the accessory holders 2202 are
formed integrally with the handle assembly 2026.                  In other embodiments, the handle
assembly 2026 may include fewer or more accessory holders 2202 or other types of
                                                         22
10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

accessory holders 2202, and/or the accessory holders 2202 may be formed as part of the
basket 2018.
[00113]              FIGS. 40-42 illustrate another embodiment of the shopping cart 2410.
Except as described below, the shopping cart 2410 is the same as the shopping cart 2010
described with regard to FIGS. 28-39, and common elements are given a reference
numeral based on the reference numerals for FIGS. 28-39 plus 400.
[00114]              As shown in FIGS. 40 and 41, the cart 2410 includes a frame 2414 supported
by a pair of front wheels 2434a and a pair of rear wheels 2434b. The rear wheels 2434b
are mounted on a lower end 2550 of each upright member 2462 such that the axle of
each rear wheel 2434b is positioned behind or rear of the upright members 2462 (FIG.
42). The frame 2414 includes a base 2458 and an arm 2460 for engaging a cart transport
system 2700 (FIGS. 43-45). The arm 2460 is coupled to the base 2458 proximate a front
end of the cart 2410. The arm 2460 is positioned between the front wheels 2434a and
extends downwardly from the base 2458. In the illustrated embodiment, the arm 2460 is
formed as a web 2464 (FIG. 40) extending downwardly from the frame 2414 and having
a bar or cross-member 2468 (FIG. 40) extending laterally toward at least one side of the
cart 2410.
[00115]              As shown in FIGS. 41 and 42, the frame 2414 also includes a projection or
ledge or shelf 2472 proximate each of the rear wheels 2434b. Each shelf 2472 is formed
as an upwardly-facing surface projecting outwardly from the side of the associated
upright member 2462 proximate the lower end 2550 thereof and is adapted to engage a
guide member 2730 of the transport system 2700 as described below.
[00116]              FIGS. 43-45 illustrate the cart transport system 2700 including an ascending
escalator 2704 and a descending escalator 2708. Grocery stores having multiple floors
typically include the cart transport system 2700 for transporting shopping carts between
floors. Because conventional shopping carts typically have a short wheelbase and an
elevated basket, a conventional cart becomes top-heavy when it is loaded with groceries
and is likely to tip over on the transport system 2700.
                                                      23
10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

[00117]              Each escalator 2704, 2708 includes a conveyor or towing track 2710, a pair
of outer tracks 2720, and a pair of guide members 2730 adjacent the outer tracks 2720.
The towing track 2710 includes a T-shaped slot 2740. The arm 2460 (FIG. 40) of the
cart 2410 is received in the slot 2740 from an end of the slot 2740 and is retained due to
interference between the slot 2740 and the cross-member 2468 of the arm 2460. The
arm 2460 engages a towing member 2744, such as a cable or hook, that moves parallel
to the slot 2740 and urges the arm 2460 and the cart 2410 along the slot 2740. The rear
wheels 2434b move along the outer tracks 2720. In the ascending escalator 2704, the
outer tracks 2720a are elevated with respect to the towing track 2710. In the descending
escalator 2708, the outer tracks 2720b are recessed with respect to the towing track
2710.
[00118]              As shown in FIG. 44, when the cart 2410 is positioned on the ascending
escalator 2704, the rear wheels 2434b roll along the outer tracks 2720a positioned above
the towing track 2710 as the cart 2410 is towed. In the illustrated embodiment, the
transport system 2700 is inclined, and the guide members 2730 are positioned above the
outer tracks 2720a. As the cart 2410 moves along the inclined portion, the rear wheels
2434b may elevate relative to front wheels 2434a. Each shelf 2472 (FIG. 41) on the cart
2410 engages one of the guide members 2730 above the outer track 2720a, thereby
preventing the rear wheel 2434b from elevating beyond a certain height with respect to
the front wheels 2434a. Therefore, the shelf 2472 prevents the cart 2410 from rotating
over the front end of the cart 2410, and it maintains the cart 2410 in a substantially level
position.
[00119]              As shown in FIG. 45, when the cart 2410 is positioned on the descending
escalator 2708, the rear wheels 2434b roll along the outer tracks 2720b as the cart 2410
is towed. Because the outer tracks 2720b are recessed relative to the towing track 2710,
the cart 2410 maintains a relatively horizontal orientation.
[00120]              FIGS. 46-53 illustrate another embodiment of the shopping cart 2810.
Except as described below, the shopping cart 2810 is the same as the shopping cart 2010
                                                   24
10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

described with regard to FIGS. 28-39, and common elements are given a reference
numeral based on the reference numerals for FIGS. 28-39 plus 800.
[00121]              As shown in FIGS. 46 and 47, the cart 2810 includes a single basket 2818
that is coupled to upright members 2862 of a frame 2814. The basket 2818 includes a
rail 2820 that is formed integrally with the basket 2818 and extends around the perimeter
of the basket 2818. The rail 2820 includes multiple grooves 2824 positioned below a
top edge of the basket 2818.             In the illustrated embodiment, the grooves 2824 are
positioned above openings in side walls of the basket 2818. The grooves 2824 provide a
grip surface for receiving a user's fingers and facilitate gripping and pulling the cart
2810 when the user is not positioned behind the cart 2810 (i.e., when the user is standing
alongside or in front of the cart 2810). In addition, the basket 2818 includes a graphic
panel 2828 (FIG. 46) coupled to one of the walls of the basket 2818 and supporting a
removable graphic element (not shown) that can be changed as desired (e.g., seasonally).
Also, in the illustrated embodiment, the basket 2818 includes support arms 2829 that
extend along the side of the basket 2818. In some embodiments, the frame 2814 may
include an arm for engaging a cart transport system as described above.
[00122]              Referring to FIG. 48, the basket 2818 includes a gate assembly 2906 and
mounting portions 2910 positioned on either side of the basket 2818. As best shown in
FIG. 49, each mounting portion 2910 includes a generally flat surface 2926 and tabs
2930 positioned proximate the sides of the surface 2926 to be inserted within tracks
2954 on the sides of the upright members 2862. In other embodiments, the tracks may
be formed on the basket 2818 and the tabs 2930 may be formed on the surface 2926. A
handle assembly 2826 includes a pair of brackets 2978, each of which includes an
opening that is aligned with an opening 2980 (FIG. 49) on the basket 2818 and an
opening 2981 on the upright members 2862. As shown in FIG. 50, a pin 2934 is then
inserted into each opening of the bracket 2978 and the openings 2980, 2981 to releasably
secure the basket 2818 and the handle assembly 2826 to the upright members 2862.
                                                   25
10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

[00123]              As shown in FIGS. 51-53, the gate assembly 2906 includes a rear wall 2908,
a seat 2912, and a folding wall 2916. In the illustrated embodiment, the gate assembly
2906 also includes accessory holders 3002. The accessory holders 3002 include round
openings 3006 positioned on either side of the cart 2810 for supporting a cup and a
lateral slot 3010 for supporting an electronic device (such as a tablet computer or a
cellular phone).                  The slot 3010 extends between the openings 3006 and is oriented
transverse to a cart axis (not shown). A notebook or electronic device can be positioned
in either a forward-facing or rearward-facing orientation so that a screen of an electronic
device is visible to either a user pushing the cart 2810 or a person seated within the cart
2810. In some embodiment, the slot 3010 includes a projection for engaging a lower
portion of the electronic device and preventing the device from being jostled out of the
slot 3010 as the user pushed the cart 2810. In other embodiments, the accessory holders
3002 are formed integrally with the handle assembly 2826. The accessory holders 3002
may include fewer or more accessory holders 3002 than those described or other types
of accessory holders 3002, including hooks for supporting a hanging article (not shown),
such as a garment or a handbag.
[00124]              As shown in FIGS. 48 and 51, the rear wall 2908 includes a pair of openings
2910 for receiving the legs of a child passenger and a pair of pins 2982 engaging
openings 2984 (FIG. 48) of the handle assembly 2826 such that the gate assembly 2906
is pivotable relative to basket 2818 and handle assembly 2826 about a first or gate axis
2924 (FIG. 51). Referring to FIG. 51, openings positioned along an edge of the seat
2912 are aligned with openings positioned on the rear wall 2908. A pin 3014 is inserted
through the openings on the rear wall 2908 and the seat 2912 so that the seat 2912 is
pivotably coupled to the rear wall 2908 about a second or seat axis 2928 that is parallel
to the gate axis 2924 and positioned below the gate axis 2924. The folding wall 2916
includes a contoured backrest 2928 and is pivotably coupled to a lower end of the rear
wall 2908 about a third or folding axis 2930 that is parallel to the gate axis 2924 and the
seat axis 2928.                  The backrest 2928 is contoured or curved in a lateral (side-to-side)
direction.
                                                        26
10246109 1 (GHMatters) P100867.AU.1

[00125]              The folding wall 2916 also defines a lateral opening 2932 receiving an edge
of the seat 2912 opposite the edge that is coupled to the rear wall 2908.              The lateral
opening 2932 extends parallel to the seat axis 2928. The seat 2912 is received in the
opening 2932 and supported by the edge of the opening 2932. As the folding wall 2916
is pivoted toward the rear wall 2908, the seat 2912 slides through the opening 2932.
When the folding wall 2916 is positioned adjacent the rear wall 2908, the gate assembly
2906 is in a collapsed state (FIG. 52). As best shown in FIG. 53, collapsing the gate
assembly 2906 causes the seat 2912 to pass through the opening 2932 and rotate
downwardly (clockwise in FIG. 53) relative to the rear wall 2908.                Similarly, as the
folding wall 2916 moves away from the rear wall 2908 toward an open state (FIG. 51),
the seat 2912 rotates upwardly (counterclockwise in FIG. 53) into a substantially
horizontal position.
[00126]              Referring to FIG. 53, in the illustrated embodiment, the rear wall 2908
includes a first angled surface 3014 facing toward the folding wall 2916 and the folding
wall 2916 includes a second angled surface 3018 that is complementary to the first
angled surface 3014 and faces toward the rear wall 2908. When the gate assembly 2906
is collapsed, the first angled surface 3014 and the second angled surface 3018 mate with
one another.
