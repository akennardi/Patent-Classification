Field
[0001]       This application is a divisional application of Australian patent application no.
<removed-apn>, which in turn claims priority from US62/370303. The specification for each of
these applications is entirely incorporated herein by reference.
[0001a]      The invention relates to a method for treating a skin disorder. The invention also
relates to a topical pharmaceutical composition comprising an extract from a Cannabis plant,
and its use in the treatment of the skin disorder.
Background
[0002]       The biological activity of Cannabis is well known, and has led it to become a
"recreational" drug. However, with the discovery of a class of cannabinoid (CB) receptors, and
the relaxation of laws regulating Cannabis use - in some jurisdictions decriminalisation - there
now exists the opportunity to explore the potential of Cannabis as a source of new therapeutics.
[0003]       There is also a growing number of patients suffering from diseases, such as skin
disorders, that are seeking natural remedies as alternative or complementary therapy.
[0004]       Accordingly, there is a continuing need to develop new treatments for skin disorders,
which are derived, at least in part, from a natural source.

[0015]       In yet another aspect, there is provided the pharmaceutical composition or topical
pharmaceutical composition for treating a skin disorder.
Description of Embodiment(s)
[0016]       The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition. The pharmaceutical
composition comprises a Cannabis extract. The pharmaceutical composition is a topical
pharmaceutical composition, meaning that it is suitable for administering the active components
of the Cannabis extract topically. The topical administration is typically local administration;
however, in some embodiments, the topical administration may be systemic. The topical
administration may preferably be administration directly to the skin of a patient.
[0017]       The inventors have found that topical administration of a Cannabis extract is useful
for treating a range of skin disorders.
Topical delivery system
[0018]       The topical pharmaceutical composition comprises a topical delivery system. The
topical delivery system may advantageously enhance the delivery of the active components of
the Cannabis extract to the skin of the patient.
[0019]       The topical delivery system preferably comprises two or more pharmaceutically
acceptable components. By "pharmaceutically acceptable", it is meant that the components are
compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and are not deleterious to a subject
upon or following administration. It is believed that the topical delivery system may enhance the
permeability of the patient's skin to increase the local absorption of the active components of
the Cannabis extract. The topical delivery system may comprise three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve or more components.
[0020]       The pharmaceutically acceptable components of the topical delivery system may be
selected from an essential oil (e.g. an oil derived from a plant, such as a herb), a wax, or a
combination thereof. The pharmaceutically acceptable components of the topical delivery
system may be selected from: Bergamot essential oil, Cedarwood essential oil, Chamomile
essential oil , Clary sage essential oil, Cypress essential oil , Eucalyptus essential oil, Fennel
essential oil, Frankincense essential oil, Geranium essential oil, Hyssop essential oil, Jasmine
essential oil, Juniper essential oil, Lavender essential oil, Lemon essential oil, Lemongrass
essential oil, Marjoram essential oil, Melaleuca essential oil, Myrrh essential oil, Myrtle essential
oil, Neem essential oil, Orange essential oil, Oregano essential oil, Palma rosa essential oil,
Patchouli essential oil, Peppermint essential oil, Rose essential oil, Rosemary essential oil,

                                                 -4
Rosewood essential oil, Sage essential oil, Sandalwood essential oil, Tangerine essential oil,
Tea tree essential oil, Thyme essential oil, Ylang ylang essential oil, Sesame oil, Olive oil,
Arnica essential oil, Lavender Spike essential oil, Cinnamon Leaf essential oil, Rosemary
Cineole essential oil, Coconut oil, Bees wax and Hemp oil. Each pharmaceutically acceptable
component may be present in the same or different amount. For example, the topical delivery
system may comprise each pharmaceutically acceptable component in an amount from 0% to
95% by weight.
[0021]       Individual ingredients of the topical delivery system may also comprise active
compounds useful for the treatment of the skin disorder. For example, essential oils that may
be useful for the treatment of a skin disorder include: Bergamot essential oil, Cedarwood
essential oil, Chamomile essential oil , Clary sage essential oil, Cypress essential oil ,
Eucalyptus essential oil, Fennel essential oil, Frankincense essential oil, Geranium essential oil,
Hyssop essential oil, Jasmine essential oil, Juniper essential oil, Lavender essential oil, Lemon
essential oil, Lemongrass essential oil, Marjoram essential oil, Melaleuca essential oil, Myrrh
essential oil, Myrtle essential oil, Neem essential oil, Orange essential oil, Oregano essential oil,
Palma rosa essential oil, Patchouli essential oil, Peppermint essential oil, Rose essential oil,
Rosemary essential oil, Rosewood essential oil, Sage essential oil, Sandalwood essential oil,
Tangerine essential oil, Tea tree essential oil, Thyme essential oil, and Ylang ylang essential oil,
or a combination thereof.

Cannabis extract
[0023]        Cannabis plants produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites, including
cannabinoids, terpenes and terpenoids, sterols, triglycerides, alkanes, squalenes, tocopherols,
carotenoids and alkaloids. The mix of these secondary metabolites varies depending on
several factors, including Cannabis variety, part of the Cannabis plant extracted, method of
extraction, processing of the extract, and season.
[0024]       There are several varieties of Cannabis plant, which have been described under two
distinct naming conventions. One of these conventions identifies three distinct species of
Cannabis plant, namely Cannabis sativa Linnaeus, Cannabis indica LAM., and Cannabis
ruderalis. Another convention identifies all Cannabis plants as belonging to the Cannabis sativa
L. species, with the various varieties divided amongst several subspecies, including: Cannabis
sativa ssp. sativa and ssp. indica. As used herein, the term "Cannabis"refers to any and all of
these plant varieties.
[0025]       Extracts of Cannabis may be prepared by any means known in the art. The extracts
may be formed from any part of the Cannabis plant containing cannabinoid, terpene and
terpenoid compounds. Extracts may be formed by contacting an extractant with a leaf, seed,
trichome, flower, keif, shake, bud, stem or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the
extract is formed from the flowers and shake of a Cannabis plant. Any suitable extractant
known in the art may be used, including, for example, alcohols (e.g. methanol, ethanol,
propanol, butanol, propylene glycol etc.), water, hydrocarbons (e.g. butane, hexane, etc.), oils
(e.g. olive oil, vegetable oil, essential oil, etc.), a solvent (e.g. ethyl acetate, polyethylene glycol,
etc.) or a supercritical fluid (e.g. liquid C02). The extractant may be completely or partially
removed prior to incorporation of the Cannabis extract into the pharmaceutical composition, or it
may be included in the pharmaceutical composition as a carrier. The extractant may be
removed by heating the extract optionally under reduced pressure. It will be appreciated that
some of the more volatile plant metabolites (such as terpenes) may also be removed with the
extractant. Accordingly, in some embodiments, removing the extractant may enrich the
cannabinoid fraction of the extract. In some embodiments, the extract is filtered to remove
particulate material, for example, by passing the extract through filter paper or a fine sieve (e.g.
a sieve with pore sizes of 5 ptm).
[0026]        In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract is formed by applying heat and

                                                   -6
pressure to the plant material. Typically, in these embodiments, no extractant is required.
[0027]       In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract is a Cannabis oil. As used herein, a
"Cannabisoil" is an extract formed by contacting at least a part of a Cannabis plant with an oil.
The extracting oil may optionally be removed. Extracting oils may be selected from olive oil,
hemp oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, vegetable oil, canola oil, grape seed oil, almond oil, medium
chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, and any other edible oil, or a combination thereof.
[0028]       The term "cannabinoid" as used herein relates to any cannabinoid that have been
isolated from a Cannabis plant or synthetically created to have activity involving the
endocannabinoid system.
[0029]       The term "cannabinoid fraction" is used to describe the combination of cannabinoid
compounds present in the Cannabis extract.
[0030]       The term "terpenes" or "terpenoids" as used herein refers to a class of hydrocarbon
molecules, which often provide a unique smell. Terpenes are derived from units of isoprene,
which has the molecular formula      C5 H8 . The basic molecular formula of terpenes are multiples of
the isoprene unit, i.e. (C5 Hs),, where n is the number of linked isoprene units. Terpenoids are
terpene compounds that have been further metabolised in the plant, typically through an
oxidative process, and therefore usually contain at least one oxygen atom.
[0031]       The term "terpene fraction" is used to describe the combination of terpene and
terpenoid compounds present in the Cannabis extract.
Cannabis extract
[0032]       The Cannabis extract comprises a cannabinoid fraction and a terpene fraction.
[0033]       In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract contains high amounts (e.g. greater
than 75% by weight) of the cannabinoid fraction. In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract
may comprise the cannabinoid fraction in an amount of about 75% to about 99.999% by weight,
for example, about 80% to about 99.999%, about 80% to about 99.99%, about 80% to about
99.9%, or about 80% to about 99.5% by weight of the Cannabis extract. In some embodiments,
the Cannabis extract comprises about 0.001% to about 20% by weight of non-cannabinoids, for
example, about 0.001% to about 15% by weight or about 0.001% to about 10% by weight non
cannabinoids.
[0034]       In some embodiments, one or more additional compounds (e.g. cannabinoid,
terpene or terpenoid compounds) may be added to the Cannabis extract. The addition of

                                               -7
compounds may be to compensate for natural variations in the relative amounts of certain
compounds being expressed in the Cannabis plant. The added compounds may be synthetic
versions of the desired compounds, they may be purified compounds obtained from other
Cannabis extracts, or they may be added by blending two or more extracts.
[0035]      To date, over 100 cannabinoids have been identified in Cannabis plants. A
comprehensive list of these cannabinoids may be found in Mahmoud A. El Sohly and Waseem
Gul, "Constituents of Cannabis Sativa." In Handbook of Cannabis Roger Pertwee (Ed.) Oxford
University Press (2014) (ISBN: 9780199662685). Cannabinoids that have been identified in

[0036]         The Cannabis extract may comprise at least 75% by weight of a main cannabinoid.
The main cannabinoid may be A 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD). The
Cannabis extract may comprise the main cannabinoid in an amount of at least 76%, 77%, 78%,
79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84% or 85% by weight of the extract.
[0037]         Typically, the Cannabis extract further comprises one or more secondary
cannabinoids. The secondary cannabinoids may be selected from Cannabinodiol (CBN),
Cannabichromanone (CBC), A 9-Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and Cannabigerol (CBG).
THC or CBD may also be present in the Cannabis extract as a secondary cannabinoid.
Typically, each secondary cannabinoid is present in an amount from 0.001% to about 20% by
weight of the extract, for example, about 0.001% to about 15% or about 0.01% to about 15% by
weight of the extract.
[0038]         In some embodiments, certain cannabinoids may be absent, or present in non
detectable amounts (e.g. less than 0.001% by weight of the analyte). In some embodiments,
the Cannabis extract may exclude one or more of the following cannabinoids:
A 9-Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), Cannabidiol (CBD), A 9-Tetrahydrocannabivarin
(THCV), Cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), Cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), Cannabinodiol (CBN) and
Cannabichromanone (CBC).
[0039]         The Cannabis extract comprises non-cannabinoid compounds, which typically
includes a terpene fraction, i.e. terpenes and terpenoids. In some embodiments, the Cannabis
extract comprises a terpene fraction in an amount of less than 20% by weight, for example, less
than 15%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2% or 1% by weight of the extract. In some
embodiments, the Cannabis extract may comprise terpene and terpenoid compounds in an
amount of more than 0.001% by weight of the extract, for example, more than 0.001%, 0.005%,

                                                 -9
0.01%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.5%, or 1% of the total weight of the extract. In some embodiments, the
Cannabis extract comprises about 0.001% to about 20% by weight of terpene and terpenoid
compounds, for example, about 0.001% to about 15% by weight, about 0.001% to about 10%
by weight, about 0.001% to about 6% by weight or about 0.001% to about 5% by weight of the
composition.
[0040]      Typically, the terpene fraction in the plant material used to form the extract may
have a different terpene/terpenoid profile than the terpene profile of the final extract, both in
terms of the amounts of specific compounds in the terpene fraction and the weight of the
terpene fraction relative to the other components. For example, a Cannabis flower may
comprise about 20% by weight cannabinoids and about 3% by weight terpenes. Following
extraction and concentration (i.e. removal of the extractant), the amount of cannabinoids may
increase to an amount of about 50-90% by weight and the terpene fraction may amount to
about 0.1-6% by weight of the Cannabis extract. This typical scenario shows that while the
cannabinoids are concentrated when the extractant is removed, the relative amount of the
terpene fraction is reduced, likely due to the volatility of many of the terpenes/terpenoids
present in the terpene fraction. Therefore, the profile of the terpene fraction present in the
Cannabis extract is significantly different from the profile of the terpene fraction that exists in
Nature.
[0041]      A variety of terpenes and terpenoids have also been identified in Cannabis extracts,
including monoterpenes, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids. For example,
the following terpenes and terpenoids have been identified in Cannabis extracts:
Alloaromadendrene, allyl hexanoate, benzaldehyde, (Z)-a-cis-bergamotene, (Z)-a-trans
bergamotene, B-bisabolol, epi-a-bisabolol, B-bisabolene, borneol (camphol), cis-y-bisabolene,
bomeol acetate (bomyl acetate), a-cadinene, camphene, camphor, cis-carveol, caryophyllene
(B-caryophyllene), a-humulene (a-caryophyllene), y-cadinene, A-3-carene, caryophyllene oxide,
1,8-cineole, citral A, citral B, cinnameldehyde, a-copaene (aglaiene), y-curcumene, B-cymene,
B-elemene, y-elemene, ethyl decdienoate, ethyl maltol, ethyl propionate, ethylvanillin,
eucalyptol, a-eudesmol, B-eudesmol, y-eudesmol, eugenol, cis-B-famesene ((Z)-B-farnesene),
trans-a-farnesene, trans-B-famesene, trans-y-bisabolene, fenchone, fenchol (norbomanol,
B-fenchol), geraniol, a-guaiene, guaiol, methyl anthranilate, methyl salicylate, 2-methyl-4
heptanone, 3-methyl-4-heptanone, hexyl acetate, ipsdienol, isoamyl acetate, lemenol, limonene,
d-limonene (limonene), linolool (linalyl alcohol, B-linolool), a-longipinene, menthol, y-muurolene,
myrcene (B-myrcene), nerolidol, trans-nerolidol, nerol, B-ocimene (cis-ocimene), octyl acetate,
a-phellandrene, phytol, a-pinene (2-pinene), B-pinene, pulegone, sabinene, cis-sabinene

                                                  - 10
hydrate (cis-thujanol), B-selinene, a-selinene, y-terpinene, terpinolene (isoterpine), terpineol
(a-terpineol), terpineol-4-ol, a-terpinene (terpilene), a-thujene (origanene), vanillin, viridiflorene
(ledene), and a-ylange.
[0042]        It is believed that the presence of the particular terpenes/terpenoids in the terpene
fraction is associated with beneficial effects of the pharmaceutical composition in use.
[0043]        The terpene fraction may comprise one or more of beta-myrcene, linalool, nerolidol,
limonene, alpha-bisabolol, camphene, delta-s-carene, beta-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide,
p-cymene, geraniol, humulene, ocimene, pinene, and alpha-terpinene.
[0044]        Preferably, the extract comprises beta-myrcene. It is believed that beta-myrcene
may enhance the bioavailability of the cannabinoids present in the extract. Beta-myrcene may
be present in an amount of from 0% to about 40% by weight of the extract. In some
embodiments, beta-myrcene is present in an amount of about 0-40% by weight of the terpene
fraction, for example, from 0.001% to about 25%, 5.1% to 29% or about 5.5% to about 25% of
the terpene fraction.
[0045]        The terpene fraction may further comprise one or more of linalool, nerolidol and
limonene.
[0046]        When present, the limonene may be present in an amount of at least about 5.4% by
weight of the terpene fraction, for example, from about 5.5% to about 50% or about 5.5% to
about 20% by weight of the terpene fraction. Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene having the
molecular formula C10 H16 . There are a number of different naturally occurring isomers;
however, the most common form is the dextrorotatory isomer, namely D-limonene.
[0047]        Linalool is a terpenoid that is found in many flower and spice plants having the
molecular formula C10 H180. It is believed that when linalool is present in a Cannabis extract,
that is may provide a sedative effect. In some embodiments, linalool may be present in an
amount of at least 0.05% by weight of the terpene fraction. In some preferred embodiments,
linalool is present in an amount of greater than 4.5% by weight (e.g. at least 5% by weight of the
terpene fraction). In other embodiments, linalool is present in an amount of from 0.05% to 25%
by weight of the terpene fraction, for example, from 0.1% to 20% or 5% to 20% by weight of the
terpene fraction.
[0048]        Nerolidol is a sesquiterpenoid having the molecular formula of C15 H2 60. It exists in
Nature in two isomeric forms, namely nerolidol 1 and nerolidol 2, which differ in the geometry

                                                  - 11
around a central olefin, i.e. either cis or trans isomers. The extract may comprise nerolidol (i.e.
nerolidol 1 and nerolidol 2) in an amount of at least 0.001% by weight of the terpene fraction, for
example, from 0.01% to 20% by weight of the terpene fraction. Nerolidol 2 may be present in a
greater amount relative to nerolidol 1. In some embodiments, nerolidol 1 may be absent (or
present in an amount below the limit of detection). In some embodiments, nerolidol 2 may be
absent (or present in an amount below the limit of detection). In some embodiments, nerolidol 1
and nerolidol 2 are absent (or present in an amount below the limit of detection). Nerolidol 1
may be present in the extract in an amount of at least about 0.001% by weight of the terpene
fraction, for example, from 0.001% to 20% or 0.001 to 15% by weight of the terpene fraction.
Nerolidol 2 may be present in the extract in an amount of at least about 0.001% by weight of the
terpene fraction, for example, from 0.001% to 30% or 1% to 25% by weight of the terpene
fraction.
[0049]       The Cannabis extract may also comprise a pinene (e.g. alpha-pinene and/or beta
pinene). Pinene is a bicyclic monoterpene having the molecular formula C10 H16 . Pinene is
found in Nature in two isomeric forms: alpha-pinene and beta-pinene. The extract may
comprise pinene (i.e. alpha-pinene and beta-pinene) in an amount of at least 5% by weight of
the terpene fraction, for example, at least 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% or 10% by weight of the terpene
fraction. Typically, alpha-pinene may be present in an amount greater than the amount of
beta-pinene. The ratio of beta-pinene to alpha-pinene may be about 4:1. Alpha-pinene may be
present in the extract in an amount of at least about 0.001% by weight of the terpene fraction,
for example, from 0.001% to 30%, 0.001% to 20% or 5% to 20% by weight of the terpene
fraction. Beta-pinene may be present in the extract in an amount of at least about 0.001% by
weight of the terpene fraction, for example, 0.001% to 25%, 1% to 25% or 1% to 10% by weight
of the terpene fraction.
[0050]       The terpene fraction may also comprise beta-caryophyllene. Beta-caryophyllene
may be present in an amount of at least 0.001% by weight of the terpene fraction, for example,
from 0.001% to 20% or 0.001% to 10% of the terpene fraction.
[0051]       The terpene fraction may also comprise caryophyllene oxide. Caryophyllene oxide
may be present in an amount of at least 0.001% by weight of the terpene fraction, for example,
from 0.001% to 50%, 5% to 40%, 10% to 40% or 20% to 40% by weight of the terpene fraction.
[0052]        In some embodiments, the extract further comprises hum ulene. It is believed that
that humulene may enhance the sedative properties of the extract. Humulene is also
sometimes called alpha-caryophyllene.

                                                  - 12
[0053]        The Cannabis extract may also include ocimene. Ocimene may be present in an
amount of at least 0.001% by weight of the terpene fraction, for example, from 0.001% to 20%
or 0.001% to 5% by weight of the terpene fraction.
[0054]        In some embodiments, specific terpenes or terpenoids may be absent, or present in
non-detectable amounts (e.g. less than 0.001% by weight of the analyte). In some
embodiments, one or more of the following terpenes or terpenoids are absent, or present in
non-detectable amounts: alpha-bisabolol, delta-s-carene, geraniol, guaiol, isopulegol, limonene,
nerolidol 1, nerolidol 2, gamma-terpinene, and terpinolene.
[0055]        The cannabinoid fraction and the terpene fraction for two exemplary pharmaceutical
compositions are set out in the following Tables 1 and 2. Amounts of cannabinoids are reported
as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and amounts of terpenes
are reported as determined by gas chromatography (GC). It will be appreciated that, as the
 Cannabis extract is derived from Nature, the amount of each component may vary in some
cases by +/- 10%, +/- 25% or +/- 50%. The ranges of amounts corresponding to each of these
limits to account for the potential variation in the composition are also shown in Table 1 and 2.

pharmaceutical
composition
Notes: Amounts shown as 0 either indicate that the compound was not detected or present in
an amount below the detection limit (e.g. less than 0.005 mg/gram)
[0056]         The pharmaceutical composition may further comprise one or more
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants, excipients or any combination thereof.
[0057]         The carrier, diluent, adjuvant and/or excipient are "pharmaceutically acceptable"
meaning that they are compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and are not
deleterious to a subject upon or following administration. The pharmaceutical compositions may
be formulated, for example, by employing conventional solid or liquid vehicles or diluents, as
well as pharmaceutical additives of a type appropriate to the mode of desired administration (for
example, excipients, binders, preservatives, stabilisers, etc.) according to techniques such as
those well known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation (See, for example, Remington: The
Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., 2005, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins). The
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be any carrier included in the United States
Pharmacopeia/National Formulary (USP/NF), the British Pharmacopoeia (BP), the European
Pharmacopoeia (EP), or the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP). In some embodiments, the carrier,
diluent, adjuvant and/or excipient may be non-natural (e.g. synthetically produced).
[0058]         The pharmaceutical composition includes those suitable for topical administration,
typically via direct application to the skin (e.g. the epidermal layer of the skin) of a patient.
[0059]         The Cannabis extract, together with a conventional adjuvant, carrier, excipient or
diluent, may thus be placed into the form of pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosages

                                                  - 15
thereof, and in such form may be employed as a solid, such as rubs or powders to be dispersed
in a liquid carrier prior to administration, or as a liquid, such as solutions, suspensions,
emulsions, or oils. Liquid compositions are preferred.
[0060]       Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms thereof may comprise
conventional ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without additional active
compounds or principles, and such unit dosage forms may contain any suitable effective
amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily dosage range to be
employed.
[0061]        For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the Cannabis extract described
herein, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form
preparations include powders, cachets, and dispensable granules. A solid carrier can be one or
more substances which may also act as diluents, lubricants, suspending agents, binders,
preservatives, or an encapsulating material.
[0062]       Suitable carriers include magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar,
lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium
carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term "preparation" is
intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as
carrier providing a dosage form in which the active component, with or without carriers, is
surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it.
[0063]       Liquid form compositions include sterile solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups,
oils and elixirs. The Cannabis extract can be suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier, such as sterile water, sterile organic solvent or a mixture of both.
[0064]       Other liquid form preparations include those prepared by combining the Cannabis
extract with one or more naturally derived oils (e.g. an essential oil) or waxes. An "essential oil"
is an oil derived by extraction (e.g. steam extraction, or contacting the plant material with an
extractant) or pressing, which contains primarily hydrophobic, and generally fragrant,
components of the plant material. Suitable naturally derived oils and waxes include any of
those mentioned for the topical delivery system described above, including: Bergamot essential
oil, Cedarwood essential oil, Chamomile essential oil , Clary sage essential oil, Cypress
essential oil , Eucalyptus essential oil, Fennel essential oil, Frankincense essential oil,
Geranium essential oil, Hyssop essential oil, Jasmine essential oil, Juniper essential oil,
Lavender essential oil, Lemon essential oil, Lemongrass essential oil, Marjoram essential oil,
Melaleuca essential oil, Myrrh essential oil, Myrtle essential oil, Neem essential oil, Orange

                                                - 16
essential oil, Oregano essential oil, Palma rosa essential oil, Patchouli essential oil, Peppermint
essential oil, Rose essential oil, Rosemary essential oil, Rosewood essential oil, Sage essential
oil, Sandalwood essential oil, Tangerine essential oil, Tea tree essential oil, Thyme essential oil,
Ylang ylang essential oil, Sesame oil, Olive oil, Arnica essential oil, Lavender Spike essential oil,
Cinnamon Leaf essential oil, Rosemary Cineole essential oil, Coconut oil, Bees wax and Hemp
oil.
[0065]       The amount of active ingredient in therapeutically useful compositions should be
sufficient that a suitable dosage will be obtained.
[0066]       Various other materials may be present to modify the physical form of the dosage
unit. For instance, the composition may contain the Cannabis extract together with a
preservative (e.g. methyl and propylparabens), and/or a dye. Of course, any material used in
preparing any dosage unit form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non
toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound(s) may be incorporated into
sustained-release preparations and formulations.
[0067]       Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents include any and all solvents,
dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying
agents and the like.
[0068]       Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted, shortly
before use, to liquid form preparations. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and
emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants,
stabilisers, buffers, dispersants, thickeners, solubilising agents, and the like.
[0069]       For topical administration to the epidermis the active ingredients may be formulated
as ointments, creams, oils or lotions, or as a transdermal patch. Ointments and creams may, for
example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening
and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in
general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents,
suspending agents, thickening agents, or colouring agents.
[0070]       In the case of a spray, this may be achieved for example by means of a metering
atomising spray pump. To improve nasal delivery and retention the compounds according to
the invention may be encapsulated with cyclodextrins, or formulated with other agents expected
to enhance delivery and retention in the nasal mucosa.

                                                 - 17
[0071]        When desired, formulations adapted to give sustained release of the active
ingredient may be employed.
[0072]        The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form,
the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active
component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing
discrete quantities of preparation, for example in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form
can be the dosage form itself, or it can be the appropriate number of these dosage forms in
packaged form.
[0073]        Also described herein are compositions absent a carrier where the compositions are
in unit dosage form. Accordingly, also provided is a medicament comprising the Cannabis
extract.
[0074]        In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises an active
agent other than the Cannabis extract. Any suitable active agent may be used provided that the
activity of the active agent and/or the Cannabis extract is not diminished when combined.
Methods of treatment
[0075]        In another aspect, also provided is a method for treating a skin disorder. The
method comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of the
pharmaceutical composition or topical pharmaceutical composition described herein.
[0076]        The pharmaceutical compositions may be used to treat a skin disorder. As used
herein, reference to "skin disorder" includes diseases and disorders of the skin. Diseases or
disorders of the skin include: acne, alopecia areata, basal cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease,
congenital erythropoietic porphyria, contact dermatitis, Darier's disease, dystrophic
epidermolysis bullosa, eczema (atopic eczema), epidermolysis bullosa simplex, erythropoietic
protoporphyria, fungal infections of nails, Hailey-Hailey disease, herpes simplex, hidradenitis
suppurativa, hirsutism, hyperhidrosis, ichthyosis, impetigo, keloids, keratosis pilaris, lichen
planus, lichen sclerosus, melanoma, melasma, pemphigus vulgaris, plantar warts (verrucas),
pityriasis lichenoides, polymorphic light eruption, psoriasis, pyoderma gangrenosum, rosacea,
scabies, shingles, squamous cell carcinoma, Sweet's syndrome, vitiligo, or a combination
thereof.
[0077]        By "effective amount" it is meant an amount sufficient that when administered to the
patient an amount of the drug is provided to achieve an effect. In the case of a therapeutic
method, this effect may be the treatment of the skin disorder. Therefore, the "effective amount"

                                                  - 18
may be a "therapeutically effective amount". By "therapeutically effective amount" it is meant an
amount sufficient that when administered to the patient an amount of drug is provided to treat
the disease or a symptom of the disease.
[0078]       As used herein, the terms "treating", "treatment", "treat" and the like mean affecting
a subject, tissue or cell to obtain a desired pharmacological and/or physiological effect. The
effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing, or reducing the severity
of, a disease or associated symptom, and/or may be therapeutic in terms of a partial or
complete cure of a disease. A reference to "treating" a skin disorder therefore encompasses:
(a) arresting spreading of the skin disease; (b) reducing the area of skin affected by the skin
disorder; (c) relieving or ameliorating the effects of the skin disorder, e.g. reducing visible signs
of the disorder, or reducing irritation caused by the skin disorder; or (d) preventing the skin
disorder from occurring in a subject predisposed to, or at risk of, the skin disorder, so that the
skin disorder does not develop or occur in the subject, or presents in a less severe form.
[0079]       The method may also comprise administering an active agent other than the
 Cannabis extract. This active agent may be administered simultaneously or consecutively with
the Cannabis extract. By consecutively it is meant that each of the Cannabis extract and the
other active agent are administered separately and may be at different times. Typically, when
the Cannabis extract and the other active agent are administered consecutively they are
administered within 24 hours, or within 12, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 hour(s) of each other. The
 Cannabis extract may be administered before or after the other active agent. Further, the route
of administration for the Cannabis extract and the other active agent may be the same or
different.
[0080]       In another aspect, also provided is the use of the Cannabis extract in the
preparation of a medicament for the treatment of the skin disorder.
[0081]       Also provided is a kit comprising in separate parts:
(a)    an effective amount of the Cannabis extract; and
(b)    a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, adjuvant, excipient or a combination
       thereof.
[0082]       In some embodiments, the kit further comprises a part comprising (b') an effective
amount of an active agent other than the Cannabis extract. Part (b') may be included in the kit,
in addition to parts (a) and (b), or in place of part (b).
[0083]       In another aspect, there is provided the pharmaceutical composition for treating the

                                                -19
skin disorder. The pharmaceutical composition may be any of the pharmaceutical compositions
described above, comprising any above-described combination of components, provided that it
comprises the Cannabis extract. The skin disorder may also be any of those described above.
Examples
[0084]       The invention will be further described by way of non-limiting examples. It will be
understood to persons skilled in the art of the invention that many modifications may be made
without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
