   "A Plastic System (Rail Rider) for Conversion of Disused Railways to Cycling and Walking
                                               Paths"
The conversion of disused railways to paths for popular use is a growing conversation but
nonetheless an intact opportunity - namely because standard conversion techniques
involve the physical removal of the railway and subsequent major works (concrete,
tarmacadam etc.), making for an exorbitantly expensive and difficult operation. The
described invention, however, counterpoints cynicism with an economical and time-saving
alternative; one that not only allows for the preservation of existing infrastructure but
employs it to technical advantage. The spirit of the patent employs strong, flexible, reusable
and quick-to-install made-to-measure polyethylene plastic clips which offer a starting point
upon which new and customised pre-fabricated plastic track is attached. Clip dimensions are
speculative and hence compliant to any size track and rails required to fit upon. With
interest too, owing to the use of plastic, paths can be built sympathetic to their environs
and, dependent on the imagination and adventure of the developer, boast almost unlimited
artistic appeal.
In online searches it was found that there have been several attempts to utilise existing rail
in a conversion system. None of these, however, were seen to exploit plastic and take
advantage of its pliable or diverse and accessible effects. A German patent application had
designs using concrete while some others explored the conversion of bicycles so they could
be ridden on the rails, but to the applicants' knowledge plastic has been - as yet
disregarded. At the time of writing there are no further references pertaining to specific
problems regarding the history of rail conversion known to the applicants, nor is there any
existing familiarity with prior art or states of technology that this invention might be drawn
toward.
An example of novel engineering then, Rail Rider presents a commercially useful manner of
manufacture, one which involves an inventive solution that evidently has not been obvious
to persons with the knowledge and experience within the invention's technological field.
While disused railways have steadily become an identifiable means of creating cycling and
pedestrian thoroughfares, owing to railways often linking suburbs to central business areas,
or traversing areas of natural beauty, this convenience is marred by the cost of converting
the rail into usable paths. Costs are currently estimated in the hundreds of thousands of
dollars per kilometre, depending on the nature of the conversion.
A large part of the expense involves removing the disused railway, and the Rail Rider system
aims to overcome this discouragement in two ways: firstly by making the cost of conversion
much cheaper by utilising the rail infrastructure; and secondly, by making the owners of the
railway more inclined to proceed with a conversion because the Rail Rider system preserves
the rail infrastructure and allows it to be returned to rail for future use. The reviewed clip is
naturally contiguous to a pre-fabricated polyethylene board as the ambition of the invention

cannot work without the both the clip and the board being united in some manner - it is
assumed that producing the clip attached to a board is both the most expedient means of
production and installation. Natural inspiration for the invention came from the applicants'
active lifestyles, like mindedness for the outdoors and a transitory discussion of Tasmanian
rail routes and their stunning access to otherwise unappreciated forest and wilderness.

CLAIMS
1.       The clip which is shown in fig.1 is made of polyethylene plastic.
2.       The clip has in its wall a protruding point and flexibility which allows it to flex over
the rail head and lock onto said rail head when plastic naturally recoils
3.       The clip's dimensions are notional and made to fit corresponding to various size
gauges wherever it is applied.
4.       The opening of the clip is angled upward.
5.       The clip contains a simple heel and toe system, wherein both are the same shape
the heel inclined to wedge over the rail head at initial application of force while the toe
works in reverse to allow the clip to recoil into locked position.
6.       The clip is contiguous to the board which supplies the converted track.
7.       The clip and board is removable and therefore reusable.
8.       The clip is the spirit of the described rail conversion system.
