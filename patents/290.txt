ABSTRACT
A system for removing and refitting rigid covers on rail wagons including a rubber tyred
gantry crane with a laterally moving trolley from which a spreader for attaching to a
cover is attached via skewed cables to reduce sway and rotation. The spreader
engages the covers via electromagnets and moves the covers to hinge on a side lip of
the wagon for loading. The cover is replaced by the reverse procedure. Optionally the
electromagnets are used to activate a latching mechanism for securing the covers.

                    System for Removing and Refitting Rigid Covers
                             on Bulk-Carrying Railway Wagons
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]      The present invention relates to the handling of rail wagon covers, in
particular an automated system for uncovering and covering a rail wagon with a rigid
cover at a bulk loading facility.
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002]      Traditionally in Australia coal rail wagons have had open tops when in
transit. Consequently a considerable amount of dust is lost from such wagons and
deposited along the train lines and adjoining properties. This is clearly undesirable
due to the environmental impact of the coal dust. Moves are now afoot to introduce
legislation to mandate the use of covers on coal wagons. As well as preventing product
loss, covered wagons also prevent product contamination and protect against rain and
snow.
[0003]      A conventional approach to handling wagons covers at bulk loading facilities
is to remove the cover before the loading facility, transport the cover around the facility
and refit the cover once the wagon has been loaded. This requires a large area for
temporary storage of covers and a convenient pathway around the loading facility.
Large mobile or fixed gantry cranes are used to remove and refit the cover, which
require the wagons to be stationary. This approach is unsuitable for coal loading
facilities as they are designed to operate with continuously moving wagons. It is not
feasible to repeatedly stop and start a large coal train.
[0004]      Alternative systems for removing and refitting wagon covers suitable for use
with continuously moving wagons are disclosed in US patent publication US 7,878,124
B2 and US patent application publication US 2016/0046304 Al. In these systems
wagon covers are attached by hinges to a wagon and removed and replaced with either
a system of helical tracks engaging the covers or an elaborate gantry system. Such
systems require a considerable area before and after the loading facility which may not
be available, and also require complicated hinging and latching arrangements to be
fitted to each wagon and cover with their inherent cost and maintenance issues.
[0005]      The object of this invention is to provide a system for removing and replacing

rigid covers on rail wagons requiring minimal infrastructure and wagon componentry to
alleviate the above problems, or at least provide the public with a useful alternative.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006]      In a first aspect the invention provides system for removing and refitting rigid
covers on rail wagons, comprising a gantry crane with a laterally moving trolley and a
suspended spreader with means for engaging a rigid cover.
[0007]      Preferably the spreader is suspended from the trolley by skewed cables and
electromagnets attached to the spreader engage magnetically susceptible pads
attached to the cover. The spreader may include side skirts for engaging the rigid
cover.
[0008]      In preference the gantry crane further comprises rubber drive wheels, may
run on rails, or may be fixed in position and comprise a longitudinally moving bridge.
[0009]      In preference the electromagnets actuate a locking mechanism to secure the
covers to the wagons, and preferably the locking mechanism comprises a locking bar
movable under a lip of the side of thewagon.
[0010]      Preferably the locking mechanism further comprises first and second
opposed cranks, and wherein vertical displacement of the magnetically susceptible
pads results in a vertical movement of the locking bar, and wherein rotational
movement of the magnetically susceptible pads results in a horizontal movement of the
locking bar.
[0011]      Preferably rotational movement of the magnetically susceptible pads is
effected by energizing the electromagnet and vertical movement of the magnetically
susceptible pads is effected by the weight of the spreader.
[0012]      Preferably the wagon cover is formed of resilient material to accommodate
vertical and rotational movement of the magnetically susceptible pads, and the
electromagnets and the magnetically susceptible pads are disposed at a non-zero
angle to each other. The side edge of the electromagnets is preferably aligned with the
centre of the magnetically susceptible pads.
[0013]      It should be noted that any one of the aspects mentioned above may include
any of the features of any of the other aspects mentioned above and may include any

                                               -Y

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0021]     The following detailed description of the invention refers to the
accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used
throughout the drawings and the following description to refer to the same and like
parts. Dimensions of certain parts shown in the drawings may have been modified
and/or exaggerated for the purposes of clarity or illustration.
[0022]     The present invention provides a system for removing and refitting rigid
covers on rail wagons gantry cranes to minimise infrastructure, and simple rigid covers
for the wagons that don't require any elaborate hinging means. Preferably rubber tyred
mobile gantries are used, however, rail mounted or fixed gantries are also anticipated
by the invention. The gantry crane can match the speed of a moving wagon and
deploy a spreader via skewed suspension ropes to engage the covers with the aid of
electromagnets. The covers are lifted up, moved laterally and lowered again to hinge
on the side of the wagons which are then loaded. Once loaded the reverse procedure
replaces the covers. As part of the system a latch mechanism is provided for securing

covers to wagons.
[0023]      As the system for refitting covers is essentially the same as the system for
removing covers, but operating in reverse, only the system for removing covers will be
shown in the figures and discussed in detail. The system for refitting covers will be
discussed in brief focussing on any differences to the system for removing covers.
[0024]      The system for removing wagon covers is shown as 10 in Figure 1 and
comprises a rail wagon 20 with rigid cover 40, and mobile gantry crane 60 with
suspended spreader 80 for engaging the rigid cover.
[0025]      The rigid cover 40 as seen in Figure 2 comprises a gel-coated fibreglass
sheet on a stout frame of extruded aluminium angle around the edge with tee section
ribs. The cover includes a planar top 42 and side skirts 44 for engaging the sides of
the wagon. Steel pads 48 are located on top of the cover for engagement with
electromagnets to move the cover. A cover typically weighs some 200 to 300 kg which
is sufficient for the cover to rely on gravity alone to stay engaged with a wagon. The
side skirts ensure that there is no lateral movement of the cover.
[0026]      The gantry crane 60 is shown in Figure 3 with suspended spreader 80 for
engaging the wagon covers 40. The gantry crane comprises a bridge 61 and four legs
62, each including an electric motor (not shown) for driving wheels 63 with rubber tyres.
 Trolley 70 traverses the bridge powered by electric motors (not shown). Drive/control
cabinet 65 houses control equipment and a diesel motor driving an alternator to power
the electric motors and control system.
[0027]      The trolley 70 includes four hoists (not shown) which control suspension
ropes 72 from which the spreader 80 is suspended. The suspension ropes are skewed
both longitudinally and laterally to minimise swaying of the spreader. The spreader
comprises a planar body 81 and side skirts 82 for engaging with the side skirts 44 of a
rigid wagon cover 40. The spreader also holds electromagnets 84 for engaging with
the steel pads 48 on the wagon cover thus allowing the cover to be controllably raised
and lowered.
[0028]      The process of removing a cover from a wagon will be discussed with the aid
of Figures 4A to 4G.
[0029]      The cover removing process is under the control of an automated control

                                                V
system located in the drive/control cabinet 65 which allows the gantry crane 60 to
operate autonomously. The process is triggered by the detection of a wagon with the
aid of an optical detector looking for the leading edge of a wagon 20. The wagons are
fitted with RFID transponders which allow their identities to be read, from which the
type of wagon and pertinent characteristics for use by the control system can be
determined such as the height and width of the wagon and the position of the steel
pads 48 used to engage with the electromagnets 84 of the spreader 80. Once a wagon
has been detected and confirmed by the presence of an RF transponder the gantry
crane will move from its parked position until it can longitudinally align the
electromagnets 84 with the steel pads 84 and match the speed of the wagon with the
aid of a speed sensor such as a back scattering Doppler radar. The control system
uses the edge detection and measured speed of the wagon together with the known
wagon parameters to produce an appropriate acceleration profile for the gantry and
controls the gantry drive motors to achieve such.
[0030]      As the gantry crane 60 matches the speed and position of the wagon 20
longitudinally as discussed above, the trolley 70 will move across the bridge 61 if
needed to laterally align the electromagnets 84 with the steel pads 48. After the initial
alignment the wagon 20 cover 40, trolley 70 and spreader 80 will be as per Figure 4A.
The electromagnets 84 are energised as the trolley hoists let out the suspension ropes
72 to lower the spreader until it engages with the cover and the electromagnets 84
engage with the steel pads 48 as shown in Figure 4B. Any small alignment errors
between the spreader and the wagon cover are overcome by the attraction of the
electromagnets to the steel pads. The suspension ropes 72 will then be retracted to
raise the spreader 80 and attached cover 40 until they are clear of the top of the wagon
as seen in Figure 4C. The trolley will then move the spreader and cover laterally and
lower them again until a first side skirt of the cover engages the side of the top lip 22 of
the wagon sides as shown in Figure 4D. The suspension ropes will then be let out,
allowing the cover and attached spreader to pivot about the top lip of the wagon sides
until the second side skirt of the cover comes into contact with the side of the wagon as
per Figure 4E. The electromagnets will then be de-energised to allow the spreader and
cover to separate and the suspension ropes retracted to raise the spreader clear from
the cover and wagon as shown in Figures 4F and 4G. The gantry crane can then be
moved back to its parked position ready to deal with another wagon whilst the
uncovered wagon proceeds through the loading facility carrying the cover on its side.

[0031]      Once the wagon has been filled and cleared the loading facility the cover is
refitted by a second gantry crane. The cover refitting process is simply the reverse of
the cover removing process, following the sequence shown in Figures 4G to 4A.
[0032]      The system has been shown and described using rubber tyred mobile gantry
cranes, however other forms of gantry crane may also be used. In a second
embodiment of the invention a rail mounted gantry crane is used. In this embodiment
tracks for the gantry crane are laid either side of the tracks for the wagon. In a third
embodiment of the invention a fixed gantry is used which allows for longitudinal
movement of the gantry bridge. In applications where the rail wagons are not required
to move continuously a still further embodiment is applicable in which the gantry crane
does not move longitudinally, having the wagons shunted into position instead.
[0033]      In the embodiments of the invention described so far the covers have been
retained on the wagons by gravity alone, relying on the significant weight of the cover
to resist displacement by wind or the air resistance inherently created by a moving
train. In a further embodiment of the invention the cover is augmented by a latching
mechanism to secure it to the wagon. The latching mechanism is activated by the
already present electromagnets used to lift the covers.
[0034]      A latching mechanism is shown in conjunction with cutaway views of a side
of a wagon and a wagon cover in Figures 5A to 5C. The figures show the sequence by
which the latch is disengaged; engagement of the latch is achieved by the reverse of
the sequence. The figures by necessity show the components' relative sizes, shapes,
positions and movements out of proportion in order to convey the underlying
mechanism involved.
[0035]      Figure 5A shows a latching mechanism 100 securing a wagon cover 120 to a
wagon side wall 110. In essence a locking bar 160 sits under a side lip 112 of the side
wall and via various linkages holds the cover 120 in place. Figure 5A only shows a
mechanism for one side of a wagon. In practise a mirror image version of the
mechanism is used to secure the other side of the wagon. Typically two pairs of
mechanisms, one fore and one aft would be used to secure a cover at four points. The
mechanism is activated/deactivated by an electromagnet 130 in conjunction with a steel
pad 122 embedded into the cover 120. In this figure the electromagnet has just come
down into contact with the pad 122 and is not influencing the mechanism. The

electromagnet is rigidly held by a spreader (not shown) which is similar to the spreader
80 seen in earlier figures, but arched to accommodate an arched cover. Tie bar 124
joins first and second sides of the wagon cover together and pivotally connects to the
fulcrum of opposed cranks 150 and 155. The cranks are in turn pivotally connected to
the locking bar 160 and the steel pad 122 via links 140 and 142. As the cranks are
opposed to each other a differential movement of the links is required for them to move
the locking bar horizontally.
 [0036]      To disengage the locking bar 124 from under the lip 112 both a vertical
movement as shown in Figure 5B and a horizontal movement as shown in Figure 5C is
required. From the position in Figure 5A the vertical movement is achieved by the
electromagnet 130 pushing down on the centre of the steel pad 122 and moving the
connected mechanism in a common mode manner. Once in the Figure 5B position
horizontal movement is achieved by actuating the electromagnet 130 which attracts the
steel pad 122, pivoting it about its centre point to provide a differential mode movement
to the connected mechanism.
 [0037]      In Figure 5B the electromagnet 130, (attached to the spreader) has been
moved downwards from the position shown in Figure 5A and the steel pad 122 moved
down in unison. The steel pad remains at an angle to the bottom face of the
electromagnet as it is not energised. As the steel pad is embedded in the wagon
cover, the wagon cover will also move down in unison, but will bend slightly as it is
restrained by the tie bar 124 sitting atop the wagon side 110. Links 140 and 142 will
also move downwards and attempt to act on the short ends of the cranks 150 and 155.
  However as the cranks are opposed to each other and both connected to the locking
bar 160, the cranks which have their fulcrums pivotally connected to the tie bar 124 will
not pivot, but instead will move down in unison and bend the tie bar. Finally, the
locking bar 160 will move down in unison with the other components and is disengaged
vertically from the lip 112 of the wagon side.
 [0038]      In Figure 5C the electromagnet 130 is energised and attracts the steel pad
 122 to its bottom face. The steel pad rotates about the point previously in contact with
the pad and consequently provides a differential movement to the links140 and 142,
moving link 140 upwards and link 142 downwards. This differential movement allows
the connected cranks 150 and 155 to rotate about their fulcrums connected to the tie
bar 124 and impart a horizontal movement to the locking bar 160. The lock bar moves

out from underneath the lip 112, freeing the cover 120 to be lifted up and off the wagon
as discussed in relation to figure 4A to 4G.
[0039]       To engage the latching mechanism 100 the electromagnet 130 is de
energised. Gravity will then be free to act on the locking bar 160, pulling it downwards,
and due to the action of the cranks 150 and 155 move it horizontally until it sits under
the wagon lip 112. Subsequent raising of the electromagnet will allow the various
components to return to the positions shown in Figure 5A, engaging the locking bar
fully to retain the cover 120 in place.
[0040]       The sequence of using electromagnets to latch and unlatch the cover is
readily integrated into the cover removal and replacement process described in relation
to Figures 4A to 4G. The electromagnets would not be energised when the spreader is
moving down towards the cover as in Figure 4A, but instead be energised once the
spreader has engaged with the cover and the skewed lines allowed to slacken. When
replacing the cover the latch is automatically activated when the electromagnetic is de
energised.
[0041]       The movement of the various components relies on resilience of both the
cover 120 and the tie bar 124. The resilient deformations are only of the order of a few
millimetres in components that span several metres and can be handled by many
different materials. The cover is preferably made from thermo-formed 3mm
polycarbonate corrugated sheets, allowing a cover for a 15 metre wagon to weigh
approximately 150kg and still be suitably rigid to allow for handling and suitably
resilient to allow the locking mechanism to function. The tie bar and other components
of the linkage mechanism can be made from mild steel.
[0042]       Further downward vertical motion of the spreader, from the "just touching"
condition of Figure 5A, is not directly controlled, but instead depends on the weight of
the spreader and the resilience of the wagon cover. With the cables suspending the
spreader now slackened the deformation of the wagon cover must be limited so that the
bottom face of the electromagnet sits at an angle to the steel pads to allow for the
common mode downward movement of the latching mechanism followed by the
differential mode movement when the electromagnet is energised.
[0043]       In practise a 300 kg spreader sitting on wagon cover as described above will
deform the cover such that the steel plates rotate by approximately 1.5%. Starting with

                                              _U
a differential slope of roughly 3.5% this will leave a 2% slope. A steel pad of
approximately 200 mm will give an airgap of approximately 2 mm and subsequent
differential movement of the links of 4mm. Once amplified by the cranks, which have
arm lengths in the ratio of 1:10, the lock bar is displaced 40 mm horizontally when the
electromagnet is energised or de-energised.
[0044]      A system employing four commercially available electromagnets, each rated
at 500 kgf will provide sufficient holding force to raise the combined weight of the
spreader and cover (approximately 450 kg) and also provide sufficient force to operate
over the 2 mm airgap to rotate the steel pad as in the transition from Figure 5B to
Figure 5C.
[0045]      The reader will now appreciate the present invention which provides a
system for removing and replacing rigid covers on rail wagons requiring minimal
infrastructure and wagon componentry. The use of skewed suspension ropes greatly
reduces any sway or rotation of the cover as it is moved. Optional latches secure the
cover for high wind situations.
[0046]      Further advantages and improvements may very well be made to the present
invention without deviating from its scope. Although the invention has been shown and
described in what is conceived to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is
recognized that departures may be made therefrom within the scope of the invention,
which is not to be limited to the details disclosed herein but is to be accorded the full
scope of the claims so as to embrace any and all equivalent devices and apparatus.
[0047]      In the present specification and claims (if any), the word "comprising" and its
derivatives including "comprises" and "comprise" include each of the stated integers
but does not exclude the inclusion of one or more further integers.
