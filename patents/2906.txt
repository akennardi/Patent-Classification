                                     Field Of The Invention
            [0001]          Embodiments generally relate a chemical composition and a
   method using that composition to form a self decontaminating surface. In certain
   embodiments, the chemical composition comprises a photocatalyst. In certain
   embodiments, the photocatalyst comprises a titanium oxide moiety. In certain
   embodiments, the chemical composition comprises an organosilane.
                                 Background Of The Invention
            [0002]          In a publication entitled "Evaluation of Two Organosilane
   Products for Sustained Antimicrobial Activity on High-Touch Surfaces in Patient
   Rooms, American Journal of Infection Control 42 (2014) 326-8, reports, inter alia,
   "[t]o the best of our knowledge, ours is the first published controlled trial of applying
   organosilane compounds to high-touch surfaces in patient rooms as a strategy for
   reducing the level of microbial contamination of environmental surfaces between
   daily cleanings." Id. at 327.
            [0003]          The authors found the two organosilanes ineffective for any
   sort of sustained antimicrobial efficacy. "In conclusion, our study was not able to
   demonstrate sustained antimicrobial activity for either organosilane product tested
   when applied to high-touch surfaces." Id. at 328.

            [00024]         A study was conducted at the Glendale Memorial Hospital and

            [000251         The Glendale Memorial Hospital Study was designed to assess
   the anti-microbial properties of Applicants' coating composition and method, wherein
   the method employed utilized an initial coating of Applicants' organosilane followed
   by an overspray of titanium dioxide. The entire ICU was subjected to the two step
   spray regime to treat all objects in each room including hard surfaces (beds, tray
   tables, bed rail, walls, etc.) and soft surfaces (drapes, cloth and vinyl covered chairs,
   woven fabrics, non-woven fabrics, leather goods, and the like). The goal of the

   Applicants' coating composition in a practical application in a health care
   environment.

   completion of Applicants' spray coating regime.

   treated surface was measured as 0.76 mg/in2 .
           [00030]          Initial microbial sampling of various fomites was conducted to
   assess the levels of bacteria on various hospital surfaces before selecting study sites.
   After review, 95 sites were selected for the study in the ICU. Each of the ninety-five (
   95) specific sites in the ICU were selected for recurring sampling at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8,
   and 15, after application of Applicants' composition. Those selected sites included
   bed rails, bed controls, tray tables, and walls above sinks. Samples were also
   collected from the two ICU nursing stations and waiting lobby including countertops,
   phones, computer keyboards, chair armrests and end tables. All movable items were
   inconspicuously tagged and coded over the course of the study so that the same
   objects could be sampled.
           [000311          Each of the sites was cultured prior to application of
   Applicants' method and at 1 week (6-8 days), 2 weeks (13-17 days), 4 weeks (29-32
   days), 8 weeks (59-62 days), 15 weeks (104-107 days) after application. Some objects
   were removed and were not available for culture at some of the subsequent time
   points.

            [000411          Levels of bacteria were reduced by 99.9% at 4 weeks post
   treatment. Overall average levels of bacteria never returned to those observed before
   treatment. Bacterial numbers increased between 8 and 15 weeks post-treatment but
   the average bacterial count on all treated surfaces was still less than 90% after 15
   weeks. No values above 10,000 CFU/100 cm 2 were seen for 4 weeks after treatment
   vs. 25.2% pre- treatment and even after 15 weeks only 11.1% of the values exceeded
   this amount.
            [00042]         No antibiotic resistant bacteria were isolated until 8 weeks after
   the treatment, and then at levels below that seen before the treatment (Table 8). No
   MRSA or CRE were isolated even after 15 weeks post-treatment and VRE only after
   8 weeks. No C. difficile were isolated during the baseline or after the treatment.
   However, C. difficile was isolated in the initial screening used to select the sampling
   sites.
            [00043]         In conclusion, the anti-microbial effects resulting from use of
   Applicants' composition and method was found to have persisted over 15 weeks in
   reducing the total number of bacteria and antibiotic resistant bacteria on both hard
   surfaces and soft surfaces within an ICU. The hard surfaces included bare metal
   surfaces, painted metal surfaces, epoxy-coated surfaces, unpainted wood surfaces,
   painted wood surfaces, and glass.
            [00044]         The fifteen weeks antimicrobial efficacy demonstrates that
   Applicants' composition forms a coating on a treated surface, where that coating is
   both antifouling and antimicrobial. Applicants' composition and the resulting coating
   formed therefrom can generate self-decontaminating surfaces that comprise both
   antifouling and antimicrobial properties, thereby, providing a cost-effective route to
   minimize transmission of disease via high touch surfaces in healthcare and industrial
   applications.

   disposing Applicants' Titanium-Oxide Moieties onto a target surface followed by
   disposing Octadecylaminodimethyltrihydroxysilylpropyl Ammonium Chloride 6 over

   Aminopropyl)trihydroxysilane and Applicants Titanium-Oxide Moieties, by spray
   deposition or by dip coating, onto a dressing prior to use of that dressing to cover a
   wound. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, a dressing is a sterile pad or
   compress applied to a wound to promote healing and/or prevent further harm. A
   dressing is designed to be in direct contact with the wound, as distinguished from a
   bandage, which is most often used to hold a dressing in place. In certain
   embodiments, Applicants' wound dressings including the following: alginates and
   other fiber gelling dressings including ropes and sheets, composite dressings, foam
   dressings with and without adhesive border, gauze with and without adhesive border,

           [000185]        When calculated relative to the timed control, choline bitartrate
   showed the greatest surface-kill, with a 2.39 log reduction in bacteria. Acetylcholine
   chloride and choline chloride showed a 1.85 and 1.40 log reduction, respectively.
   When compared with the results of aqueous solutions of Aminopropyl triethoxysilane
   (APTES) and the cholines at the same concentration, it is clear that these solutions are
   much more antimicrobial than the cholines on their own. APTES +Choline Chloride

   2040 contains choline chloride, while ABS-2041contains choline bitartrate). Carriers

   not completely dry even after 2 days of drying time. 20 microliters of cultures of
   E.coli 25592 grown at 37 C for 18 hours were added to each carrier. Following
   inoculation of the carriers, the carriers were swabbed with D/E neutralizing broth and
   processed for the zero hour time point. This was repeated for the land 4 hour time
   points.
            [000191]       The collected samples were then diluted in PBS and 100
   microliters were plated on to TSA plates and left 0/N at 37 0C before counting and
   calculating cfu/ml. All carriers were tested in duplicate and two experiments were
   performed (A and B in data table) in tandem. All data is represented as the mean+/
