Technical Field
[0001] The present invention relates to a fishing net. In particular, the present invention
relates to a fishing net for catching prawns.
Background of the Invention
[0002]     Catching prawns, also known as prawning, is a popular recreational pastime in many
coastal regions during the summer months. There are several different ways that prawns can be
caught. The regulations which define permissible equipment and catch limits vary state by state.
[0003]     One common technique of prawning involves the use of a scoop net and a torch or
other such light source. The use of a scoop net is one of the most popular ways to catch prawns
and it involves using a scoop and bright light to spot prawns as they move from the estuaries to
the ocean, normally on the run out tide. Generally the process requires the person to hold the
net in one hand and the light in the other hand. This method dictates that the user has limited
ability to do other tasks simultaneously, as the independent use of the net and torch requires
considerable dexterity. Furthermore, the process can be difficult for children and some adults to
perfect due to the independent operation of the torch and net.
[0004]     One common lighting arrangement utilises a dedicated underwater prawn light which is
typically powered by a car or motorcycle battery. The user must separately carry the battery, or
alternatively arrange for the battery to be positioned in a boat or other floating structure, and
connected to the light with power cables. The separate nature of the battery and the light is
cumbersome and impractical, and makes it difficult for the user to be agile and responsive to the
prawns as they move, or other changing conditions.
[0005]     Using conventional waterproof lights, such as waterproof torches, is not ideal as the
light is directed from the user's hands downwardly, generally toward the bottom of the estuary or
seabed. However, in practice, the optimal angle of the light beam dictates that the light beam
extends parallel or close to parallel with the bottom, so that the light beam extends generally
horizontally.
[0006]     Drag netting is an alternative way to catch prawns. The drag net has fine mesh with
floats located on the top and weights on the bottom and a central pocket to trap the prawns.
Whilst drag netting permits a lot of prawns to be caught, it generally requires the assistance of at
least two people. As such, drag netting does not offer the simplicity of scoop netting which can

                                                   3
be performed by a single person. Furthermore, drag netting is not permitted in many places due
to fishing regulations.
[0007]    A large proportion of anglers who attempt to catch prawns also attempt to catch various
species of fish at other times. Fishing from boats and structures such as jetties typically requires
the use of a landing net to secure and lift the fish when it is pulled to the surface. However, due
to the regulated nature of prawning, and the specific nets types which must be used, it is not
normally possible to use the same net for both prawning and fishing.
Object of the Invention
[0008]    It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least ameliorate
one or more of the above disadvantages, or to provide a useful alternative.
Summary of the Invention
[0009]    In a first aspect, the present invention provides a fishing net including:
          a handle having a proximal end and a distal end;
          a frame connected to the distal end;
          a net secured to the frame; and
          at least one light source mounted to the frame and/or handle.
[0010]    The light source is preferably an LED light source powered by one or more batteries
located in the handle.
[0011]    The LED light source preferably includes a plurality of LED lights located around the
frame.
[0012]    The LED light source preferably includes a primary light source and a secondary light
source, wherein the secondary light source is a different colour to the primary light source.
[0013]    The primary light source preferably provides a white/yellow light and the secondary
light source provides blue light.
[0014]    The net is preferably secured to a collar and the collar isselectively removable from the
frame.
[0015]    The collar is preferably configured to be seated between the frame and a flange
extending inwardly and rearward relative to the frame.
[0016]    The handle and/or the frame are preferably buoyant.
[0017]    The fishing net further preferably includes an end cap for hermetically sealing the
battery within the handle.

Brief Description of the Drawings
[0018] A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of specific
example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
[0019] Fig. 1 is a front view of a fishing net according to a first embodiment of the present
invention.
[0020] Fig. 2 is an isometric view of a fishing net according to a second embodiment of the
present invention.
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments
[0021] A fishing net 10 is disclosed herein. The fishing net 10 includes a longitudinally
extending handle 20. The handle 20 is made with a soft polymer coating, which makes the
handle 20 easy to grip. The handle 20 has a proximal end 30 and a distal end 40, which is
connected to a frame or hoop 50 and which defines the mouth of the fishing net 10.
[0022] The frame 50 may be integrally formed with the handle 20, or alternatively, it may
be separately manufactured and connected with suitable fasteners, or another connection
means.
[0023] The fishing net 10 is intended primarily for prawn fishing, which is heavily regulated
in some areas, such as the states and territories of Australia. Accordingly, the dimensions of
the fishing net 10 are generally sized to meet the local regulations of a given market. For
example, in NSW, the maximum diameter of the hoop 50 for scoop nets is 600mm, and the
minimum mesh size is 20mm. Furthermore, the drop (length of the net) may not exceed
1.25 metres.
[0024] Normally the frame 50 is provided with at least one flat or generally flat section to
enable the net to be effectively dragged along, or close to, the bottom of the waterway to
catch any prawns located on the bottom. As such, the typical frame 50 shape is generally in
the form of an irregular pentagon, in which the two shortest sides 60 are the sides closest to
the distal end 40 of the handle 20. The three remaining sides are longer, and the side 80
which is furthest from the handle 20 is generally the longest side 80. It will be appreciated
that other frame 50 shapes and sizes may be permissible based on local regulations.
[0025] On the handle 20 and/or around the perimeter of the hoop 50, there is one or more
light sources 100. Preferably the light source is provided by a LED (light emitting diode) light
110 or one or more strips of LED lights. Advantageously, the LED lights 110 are highly

                                                   5
energy efficient, meaning that it is generally unnecessary to regularly replace the battery
power source during a fishing trip.
[0026] The power source of the LED lights 110 is provided by batteries 85 which are stored
within the handle 20. The batteries 85 may be rechargeable. The batteries 85 can be
accessed by removing an end cap 120 from the proximal end 30 of the handle 20. The end
cap 120 is secured to the handle 20 in a waterproof manner, to prevent the ingression of
water into the battery 85 compartment. As such, there may be a threaded connection and
gasket type arrangement between the end cap 120 and the handle 20.
[0027] In the embodiment described above, the LED lights 110 are white/yellow lights,
which are preferred for prawning, as the white/yellow light assists the user to see and/or
attract the prawns. However, in one embodiment, the lights 110 also include a secondary
light 130 or set of lights in a different colour, which is preferably a blue light. In this
embodiment, the secondary, blue light 130 is used when the fishing net 10 is deployed as a
landing net for fishing. Specifically, when fishing from a boat or a fixed structure, when an
angler reels in a large fish, it is preferable to use a landing net to raise the fish from the
water into the boat.
[0028] A landing net reduces the strain in the fishing line, and minimises the chance of the
fish getting away at the final stage of the catch. However, at night time, if the angler uses a
torch or other light source, there is a risk that the white light will startle the fish, and cause it
to pull away from the hook in an erratic manner, and possibly break the line or otherwise
become free. For this reasons, using blue light may be favourable on a landing net, as it is
less likely to disturb the fish.
[0029] Furthermore, the blue light penetrates the water to a greater extent than white
light, providing the fisherman with improved visibility as the fish approaches the boat.
[0030] The nets used for prawning are typically fabricated from nylon. Such nylon nets are
normally very fine, to reduce their visibility to the prawns. However, fine nylon nets are
generally not suitable for use as landing nets, as they do not have sufficient strength to
withstand the weight of the fish, and they are likely to be damaged by the gills or spines
present on certain fish.
[0031] In order to overcome this drawback, in one embodiment, depicted in Fig. 2, the
fishing net 10 is fabricated with an interchangeable net 15. In this embodiment, the white
lights 110 may be selected, or the secondary, blue lights 130, may alternatively be selected.

                                                6
A control unit 90 on the handle 20 allows the user to turn on the white light 110 or
selectively switch to the blue light 130.
[0032] Fig. 2 depicts an alternative embodiment of the fishing net 10 having an
interchangeable net 15. The interchangeable net 15 can be removed from the fishing net 10,
in order to change the nets, for example from a nylon prawning net to a thick rubber landing
net. In the embodiment depicted in Fig. 2, the interchangeable net 15 is connected to a rigid
collar or rim 200. The rim 200 is extends around the perimeter of the net 15. The rim 200 is
adapted to be received by an engagement formation 210 located on one side, preferably a
rear side, of the fishing net 10. The rim 200 and net 15 are installed by inserting in the
direction of the arrow shown in Fig. 2.
[0033] In the preferred embodiment, the engagement formation 210 is defined by a
rearward extending projection or rib 220 which has an inwardly extending flange 230. The
projection 220 and flange 230 together define a seat for supporting the rim 200 of the
interchangeable net 15. In order to install the interchangeable net 15, the user slides the rim
200 into the space between the hoop 50 and the flange 230.
[0034] The flange 230 preferably extends along the lowermost side 80 and also the two
adjacent sides 70. As such, the interchangeable net 15 is inserted downwardly from the
direction of the handle toward the lowermost side 80. Advantageously, this means that the
user can swing the fishing net 10 by the handle 20, without the interchangeable net 15
coming loose.
[0035] It will be appreciated that in an alternative embodiment, the flange 230 may be
located on the front side of the frame 50, such that the net 15 passes through the frame 50.
[0036] It will also be appreciated that other cartridges or attachment means may be
deployed to facilitate the goal of providing a net 15 that is selectively removable and
interchangeable relative to the frame 50.
[0037] The rim 200 can be provided with different net types. This permits the user to
selectively change between light gage nylon net for prawning, or a heavier gage rubber net
depending on whether the user is prawning or fishing. Furthermore, the net 15 can be easily
change if it becomes damaged.
[0038] The user may also selectively change between the white lights 110 and/or the
secondary blue lights 130, depending on whether the user is prawning or fishing. The handle
includes an on/off switch and toggle 90 to change between the primary and secondary light
sources 110, 130.

                                                 7
[0039] The handle 20 and/or the frame 50 are buoyant and designed to float. This is
advantageous as it reduces the likelihood of the fishing net 10 becoming lost if dropped in
the water.
[0040] It will be appreciated that the LED lights 110, 130 may extend around the entire
frame 50. Alternatively, the LED lights 110, 130 may be intermittently spaced. Alternatively,
a single white LED light 110 may be used, or a single white LED light 110 and a single blue
LED light 130.
[0041] Although the invention has been described with reference to specific examples, it
will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many
other forms.
