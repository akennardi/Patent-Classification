Background
1. 1. Background of Related Art
[0002] The present disclosure relates to forceps used for open surgical procedures. More
particularly, the present disclosure relates to a forceps that applies electrosurgical current to seal
tissue.
2.     Technical Field
[0003] A hemostat or forceps is a simple plier-like tool which uses mechanical action between
its jaws to constrict vessels and is commonly used in open surgical procedures to grasp, dissect
and/or clamp tissue. Electrosurgical forceps utilize both mechanical clamping action and
electrical energy to effect hemostasis by heating the tissue and blood vessels to coagulate,
cauterize and/or seal tissue.
[0004] Certain surgical procedures require sealing and cutting blood vessels or vascular tissue.
Several journal articles have disclosed methods for sealing small blood vessels using
electrosurgery. An article entitled Studies on Coagulation and the Development of an
Automatic Computerized Bipolar Coagulator, J. Neurosurg., Volume 75, July 1991, describes a
bipolar coagulator which is used to seal small blood vessels. The article states that it is not
possible to safely coagulate arteries with a diameter larger than 2 to 2.5 mm. A second article is
entitled Automatically Controlled Bipolar Electrocoagulation - "COA-COMP", Neurosurg.
Rev. (1984), pp. 187-190, describes a method for terminating electrosurgical power to the vessel
so that charring of the vessel walls can be avoided.

                                                   2
[0005] By utilizing an electrosurgical forceps, a surgeon can either cauterize,
coagulate/desiccate, reduce or slow bleeding and/or seal vessels by controlling the intensity,
frequency and duration of the electrosurgical energy applied to the tissue. Generally, the
electrical configuration of electrosurgical forceps can be categorized in two classifications: 1)
monopolar electrosurgical forceps; and 2) bipolar electrosurgical forceps.
[0006] Monopolar forceps utilize one active electrode associated with the clamping end effector
and a remote patient return electrode or pad which is typically attached externally to the patient.
When the electrosurgical energy is applied, the energy travels from the active electrode, to the
surgical site, through the patient and to the return electrode.
[0007] Bipolar electrosurgical forceps utilize two generally opposing electrodes which are
disposed on the inner opposing surfaces of the end effectors and which are both electrically
coupled to an electrosurgical generator. Each electrode is charged to a different electric
potential. Since tissue is a conductor of electrical energy, when the effectors are utilized to
grasp tissue therebetween, the electrical energy can be selectively transferred through the tissue.
[0008] In order to effect a proper seal with larger vessels, two predominant mechanical
parameters must be accurately controlled - the pressure applied to the vessel and the gap
between the electrodes both of which affect thickness of the sealed vessel. More particularly,
accurate application of the pressure is important to oppose the walls of the vessel, to reduce the
tissue impedance to a low enough value that allows enough electrosurgical energy through the
tissue, to overcome the forces of expansion during tissue heating and to contribute to the end
tissue thickness which is an indication of a good seal. It has been determined that a fused vessel
wall is optimum between 0.001 and 0.006 inches. Below this range, the seal may shred or tear
and above this range the lumens may not be properly or effectively sealed.
[0009] With respect to smaller vessel, the pressure applied to the tissue tends to become less
relevant whereas the gap distance between the electrically conductive surfaces becomes more
significant for effective sealing. In other words, the chances of the two electrically conductive
surfaces touching during activation increases as the vessels become smaller.
[0010] Electrosurgical methods may be able to seal larger vessels using an appropriate
electrosurgical power curve, coupled with an instrument capable of applying a large closure

                                                     3
force to the vessel walls. It is thought that the process of coagulating small vessels is
fundamentally different than electrosurgical vessel sealing. For the purposes herein,
"coagulation" is defined as a process of desiccating tissue wherein the tissue cells are ruptured
and dried and vessel sealing is defined as the process of liquefying the collagen in the tissue so
that it reforms into a fused mass. Thus, coagulation of small vessels is sufficient to permanently
close them. Larger vessels need to be sealed to assure permanent closure.
[0011] Numerous bipolar electrosurgical forceps have been proposed in the past for various
open surgical procedures. However, some of these designs may not provide uniformly
reproducible pressure to the blood vessel and may result in an ineffective or non-uniform seal.
For example, U.S. Patent No. 2,176,479 to Willis, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,005,714 and 4,031,898 to
Hiltebrandt, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,827,274, 5,290,287 and 5,312,433 to Boebel et al., U.S. Patent
Nos. 4,370,980, 4,552,143, 5,026,370 and 5,116,332 to Lottick, U.S. Patent No. 5,443,463 to
Stern et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,484,436 to Eggers et al. and U.S. Patent No. 5,951,549 to
Richardson et al., all relate to electrosurgical instruments for coagulating, cutting and/or sealing
vessels or tissue.
[0012] Many of these instruments include blade members or shearing members which simply
cut tissue in a mechanical and/or electromechanical manner and are relatively ineffective for
vessel sealing purposes. Other instruments rely on clamping pressure alone to procure proper
sealing thickness and are not designed to take into account gap tolerances and/or parallelism and
flatness requirements which are parameters which, if properly controlled, can assure a consistent
and effective tissue seal. For example, it is known that it is difficult to adequately control
thickness of the resulting sealed tissue by controlling clamping pressure alone for either of two
reasons: 1) if too much force is applied, there is a possibility that the two poles will touch and
energy will not be transferred through the tissue resulting in an ineffective seal; or 2) if too low
a force is applied, a thicker less reliable seal is created.

Detailed Description
[0039] Referring initially to Figs. 1 and 2, a forceps 10 for use with open surgical procedures
includes elongated shaft portions 12a and 12b each having a proximal end 14a, 14b and a distal
end 16a and 16b, respectively. In the drawings and in the description that follows, the term
"proximal", as is traditional, will refer to the end of the forceps 10 that is closer to the user,
while the term "distal" will refer to the end that is further from the user.
[0040] The forceps 10 includes an end effector assembly 100 that attaches to the distal ends 16a
and 16b of shafts 12a and 12b, respectively. The end effector assembly 100 includes pair of
opposing jaw members 110 and 120 that are pivotably connected and movable relative to one
another about a pivot 65 (Fig. 2) to grasp tissue. Pivot 65 is disposed on a proximal end of jaw
member 120 and includes opposing halves 65a and 65b disposed on opposing sides of a channel

                                                    9
 126 (Fig. 4C) that is configured to facilitate reciprocation of a cutting mechanism or knife 85
therethrough (Fig. 2), as discussed in detail below.
 [0041] Each shaft 12a and 12b includes a handle 15 and 17, respectively, disposed at the
proximal end 14a and 14b thereof. Each handle 15 and 17 defines a finger hole 15a and 17a,
respectively, therethrough for receiving a finger of the user. Handles 15 and 17 facilitate
movement of the shafts 12a and 12b relative to one another which, in turn, pivot the jaw
members 110 and 120 from an open position wherein the jaw members 110 and 120 are
disposed in spaced relation relative to one another to a clamping or closed position wherein the
jaw members 110 and 120 cooperate to grasp tissue therebetween.
 [0042] As best seen in Fig. 2, shaft 12a is constructed from two components, namely, 12al and
 12a2, that are coupled together to form shaft 12a. Likewise, shaft 12b is constructed from two
components, namely, 12bl and 12b2, that are coupled together to form shaft 12b. In some
embodiments, component halves 12al and 12a2 and component halves 12bl and 12b2 are
ultrasonically welded together at a plurality of different weld points and/or may be mechanically
coupled together by any suitable method including snap-fitting, adhesive, fastened, etc.
 [0043] The arrangement of shaft 12b is slightly different from shaft 12a. More particularly,
shaft 12a is generally hollow to house the knife 85 and an actuating mechanism 40. The
actuating mechanism 40 is operatively associated with a trigger 45 having handle members 45a
and 45b disposed on opposing sides of shaft 12a to facilitate left-handed and right-handed
operation of trigger 45. Trigger 45 is operatively associated with a series of suitable inter
cooperating elements (e.g., Fig. 2 shows a trigger link 43, a knife pushing link 41, a spring 49,
and an anti-deployment link 47) configured to mechanically cooperate (not explicitly shown) to
actuate the knife 85 through tissue grasped between jaw members 110 and 120 upon actuation of
trigger 45. Handle members 45a and 45b operate in identical fashion such that use of either of
handle members 45a and 45b operates the trigger 45 to reciprocate the knife 85 through the
knife channel 115 (Fig. 5C). Further, the proximal end 14b of shaft 12b includes a switch cavity
 13 protruding from an inner facing surface 23b of shaft 12b and configured to seat a depressible
switch 50 therein (and the electrical components associated therewith). Switch 50 aligns with an
opposing inner facing surface 23 a of the proximal end 14a of shaft 12a such that upon
approximation of shafts 12a and 12b toward one another, the switch 50 is depressed into biasing
engagement with the opposing inner facing surface 23a of the proximal end 14a of shaft 12a.

                                                  10
[0044] As shown in Fig. 1, an electrosurgical cable 210 having a plug 200 at its proximal end
connects the forceps 10 to an electrosurgical generator (not shown). More specifically, the
distal end of the cable 210 is securely held to the shaft 12b by a proximal shaft connector 19 and
the proximal end of the cable 210 includes a plug 200 having prongs 202a, 202b, and 202c that
are configured to electrically and mechanically engage the electrosurgical generator.
[0045] The tissue grasping portions of the jaw members 110 and 120 are generally symmetrical
and include similar component features that cooperate to permit facile rotation about pivot 65 to
effect the grasping and sealing of tissue. As a result, and unless otherwise noted, jaw member
110 and the operative features associated therewith are initially described herein in detail and
the similar component features with respect to jaw member 120 will be briefly summarized
thereafter.
[0046] With reference to Figs. 3A and 3B, jaw member 110 includes an outer housing 116a,
first and second non-conductive plastic insulators 108a and 1 14a, and an electrically conductive
sealing surface 112a. The first and second insulators 108a and 114a are overmolded about jaw
housing 116a in a two-shot overmolding process. More specifically, the first insulator 108a is
overmolded about jaw housing 1 16a to electrically insulate the jaw housing 1 16a from sealing
surface 1 12a and the second insulator 1 14a is overmolded about jaw housing 1 16a to secure the
electrically conductive sealing surface 112a thereto. This may be accomplished by stamping, by
overmolding, by overmolding a stamped sealing surface, and/or by overmolding a metal
injection molded sealing surface. The jaw members 110 and 120 are made from a conductive
material. In some embodiments, the jaw members 110 and 120 are powder coated with an
insulative coating to reduce stray current concentrations during sealing.
[0047] As best shown by the cross-sectional view of Fig. 3B, electrically conductive sealing
surface 112a ofjaw member 110 is pronounced from the jaw housing 116a and the second
insulator 1 14a such that tissue is grasped by the opposing electrically conductive sealing
surfaces 112a and 1 12b when jaw members 110 and 120 are in the closed position.
[0048] Likewise, jaw member 120 includes similar elements that correspond to jaw member 110
including: an outer housing 116b, first and second plastic insulators 108b and 114b, and an
electrically conductive sealing surface 1 12b that is pronounced from the jaw housing 1 16b and
second insulator 114b. As described above with respect to jaw member 110, the first insulator

                                                   11
108b electrically insulates the jaw housing 116b from the sealing surface 112b and the second
insulator 114b secures the sealing surface 112b to the jaw housing 116b. Insulators 114a and
114b extend along the entire length ofjaw members 110 and 120, respectively, to reduce
alternate or stray current paths during sealing. In some embodiments, each of sealing surfaces
112a and 112b may include an outer peripheral edge that has a radius such that each insulator
114a and 114b meets the respective sealing surface 112a and 112b along an adjoining edge that
is generally tangential to the radius and/or meets along the radius.
[0049] As shown in Figs. 3A and 3B, at least one of the jaw members, e.g., jaw member 120,
includes at least one stop member 750 disposed on the inner facing surfaces of the electrically
conductive sealing surface 112b and/or 112a. Alternatively or in addition, the stop member(s)
750 may be disposed adjacent to the electrically conductive sealing surfaces 112a, 112b or
proximate the pivot 65. The stop member(s) 750 facilitate gripping and manipulation of tissue
and to define a gap between opposing jaw members 110 and 120 during sealing and cutting of
tissue. In some embodiments, the stop member(s) 750 maintain a gap distance between
opposing jaw members 110 and 120 within a range of about 0.001 inches (~0.03 millimeters) to
about 0.006 inches (~0.015 millimeters).
[0050] As shown in Fig. 2, shaft 12b includes a beam 57 disposed therein and extending
between handle 15 and jaw member 110. In some embodiments, the beam 57 is constructed of
flexible steel to allow the user to generate additional sealing pressure on tissue grasped between
the jaw members 110 and 120. More specifically, once end effector assembly 100 is closed
about tissue, the shafts 12a and 12b may be squeezed toward each other to utilize the flexibility
of the beam 57 to generate the necessary closure pressure between jaw members 110 and 120.
In this scenario, the mechanical advantage realized by the compressive force associated with the
beam 57 facilitates and assures consistent, uniform, and accurate closure pressure about tissue
grasped between jaw members 110 and 120 (e.g., within a working pressure range of about 3
kg/cm 2 to about 16 kg/cm 2). By controlling the intensity, frequency, and duration of the
electrosurgical energy applied to the tissue, the user can seal tissue. In some embodiments, the
gap distance between opposing sealing surfaces 112a and 112b during sealing ranges from about
0.001 inches to about 0.005 inches.
[0051] In some embodiments, the sealing surfaces 112a and 112b are relatively flat to avoid
current concentrations at sharp edges and to avoid arcing between high points. In addition, and

                                                    12
due to the reaction force of the tissue when engaged, each of jaw members 110 and 120 may be
manufactured to resist bending, e.g., tapered along its length to provide a constant pressure for a
constant tissue thickness at parallel and the thicker proximal portion of the jaw members 110
and 120 will resist bending due to the reaction force of the tissue.
[0052] As shown in Figs. 3A, 3B, 4B, and 4C, at least one of jaw members 110 and 120
includes a knife channel 115 a and/or 1 15b, respectively, disposed therebetween that is
configured to allow reciprocation of a knife 85 therethrough. In the illustrated embodiment, a
complete knife channel 115 is formed when two opposing channel halves 115 a and 1 15b
associated with respective jaw members 110 and 120 come together upon grasping of the tissue.
Each plastic insulator 108a and 108b includes a trough 121a and 121b, respectively, that aligns
in vertical registration with an opposing knife channel half 115 a and 1 15b, respectively, such
that knife 85 does not contact or cut through plastic insulators 108a and 108b upon reciprocation
through knife channel 115. In some embodiments, the width of knife channels 115 a and 1 15b
and their respective troughs 121a and 121b may be equal along an entire length thereof.
[0053] As best shown in Fig. 4A, the interior of cable 210 houses leads 71a, 71b and 71c. Leads
71a, 71b, and 71c extend from the plug 200 through cable 210 and exit the distal end of the
cable 210 within the proximal connector 19 of shaft 12b. More specifically, lead 71a is
interconnected between prong 202b and a first terminal 75a of the switch 50. Lead 71b is
interconnected between prong 202c and a solder sleeve 73a which, in turn, connects lead 71b to
an RF lead 71d and to a second terminal 75b of the switch 50 via a connector lead 71f. RF lead
71d carries a first electrical potential of electrosurgical energy from lead 71b to sealing surface
1 12a. Lead 71c is interconnected between prong 202a and a solder sleeve 73b which, in turn,
connects lead 71c to an RF lead 71e. RF lead 71e carries a second electrical potential of
electrosurgical energy from lead 71c to sealing surface 112b.
[0054] With reference to Fig. 4B, a lead channel 77 is defined in the proximal end of jaw
member 110 to provide a pathway for lead 71 d to connect to a junction 311 a (Fig. 3A)
extending from a proximal end of sealing surface 112a. A proximal end of lead channel 77
opens into a raceway 70 that includes a generally elongated configuration with a narrowed
proximal end 72 and a broadened distal end 74 that defines an arcuate sidewall 68. Lead 71d is
routed to follow a path through the proximal end 72 of raceway 70 and, further, through lead
channel 77 for connection to junction 311 a.

                                                  13
[0055] With reference to Fig. 4C, pivot halves 65a and 65b are disposed on opposing sides of
channel 126 to facilitate translation of the knife 85 therethrough (Figs. 5A-5C). Pivot halves
65a and 65b are disposed in a split spherical configuration and each include a respective base
portion 165a and 165b that support an extension portion 166a and 166b thereon, respectively.
Extension portions 166a and 166b are configured to engage correspondingly-dimensioned
apertures 67a and 67b, respectively, disposed through pivot plate 66 to pivotably secure jaw
member 110 to jaw member 120. A lead channel 109 is defined in the proximal end of jaw
member 120 to provide a pathway for lead 71 e to connect to a junction 311 b extending from a
proximal end of sealing surface 112b. Lead 71e is routed to follow a path through raceway 70
and, further between opposing pivot halves 65a and 65b and through lead channel 109 for
connection to junction 311 b.
[0056] With reference to Figs. 5A-5C, as the user applies closure pressure on shafts 12a and 12b
to depress switch 50 (Fig. 5B), a first threshold is met corresponding to the closure force applied
to switch 50 as a function of displacement of switch 50 that causes switch 50 to generate a first
tactile response that corresponds to a complete grasping of tissue disposed between jaw
members 110 and 120. Following the first tactile response, as the user applies additional closure
pressure on shafts 12a and 12b (Fig. 5C), a second threshold is met corresponding the closure
force applied to switch 50 as a function of displacement of switch 50 that causes the switch 50
to generate a second tactile response that corresponds to a signal being generated to the
electrosurgical generator to supply electrosurgical energy to the sealing surfaces 112a and 112b.
More specifically, the second tactile response indicates closing of a normally open circuit
between switch terminals 75a and 75b and, in turn, establishment of an electrical connection
between leads 71a and 71b. As a result of the electrical connection between leads 71a and 71b,
the electrosurgical generator senses a voltage drop between prongs 202b and 202c and, in
response thereto, supplies electrosurgical energy to sealing surfaces 112a and 112b via leads 71d
and 71 e, respectively.
[0057] In one embodiment, the first tactile response indicates to the user that the maximum
grasping pressure has been reached before end effector 100 is energized where the user is free to
approximate, manipulate, and grasp tissue as needed. In this scenario, the second tactile
response indicates to the user the electrosurgical activation of the end effector 100. The switch
50 may include a plurality of other tactile responses between the above discussed first and
second tactile responses and/or subsequent to the second tactile response that correspond to

                                                   14
particular functions of the forceps 10 such as, for example, operation of the knife 85 and/or the
actuation assembly 40, operation of a safety lockout mechanism associated with the actuation
assembly 40, as discussed in detail below.
 [0058] As shown in Fig. 4A, forceps 10 may include a gauge or sensor element 87 disposed
within one or both of shafts 12a, 12b such that the clamping or grasping forces being applied to
target tissue by end effector 100 may be measured and/or detected. For example, in some
embodiments, sensor element 87 may be a strain gauge 87 operably associated with one or both
jaw members 110, 120. Sensor element 87 may be one or more Hall effect sensors or strain
gauges such as, for example, metallic strain gauges, piezoresistive strain gauges, that may be
disposed within one or both of shafts 12a and 12b and/or within one or both of jaw members
 110 and 120 to detect tissue pressure. Metallic strain gauges operate on the principle that as the
geometry (e.g., length, width, thickness, etc.) of the conductive material changes due to
mechanical stress, the resistance of the conductive material changes as a function thereof. This
change in resistance is utilized to detect strain or applied mechanical stress such as, for example,
the mechanical stress applied to tissue by jaw members 110 and 120. Piezoresistive strain
gauges operate based on the changing resistivity of a semiconductor due to the application of
mechanical stress.
 [0059] Hall effect sensors may be incorporated to determine the gap between jaw members 110
and 120 based on a detected relationship between the magnetic field strength between jaw
members 110 and 120 and the distance between jaw members 110 and 120.
 [0060] In some embodiments, one or more reed switches 81a, 81b may be incorporated within
shafts 12a and 12b to determine the proximity thereof relative to one another, as shown in Fig.
4A. More specifically, the reed switch(s) may be comprised of a switch 81 a disposed within
one of the shafts (e.g., shaft 12a) and a magnetic element 81b (e.g., electromagnet, permanent
magnet, coil, etc.) disposed within the opposing shaft (e.g., shaft 12a) such that upon
approximation of shafts 12a and 12b, the reed switch 81a is activated or closed by the magnetic
field of the magnetic element 81b and, likewise, as shafts 12a and 12b are moved away from
each other, the lack of magnetic field operates to deactivate or open the reed switch 81 a. In this
manner, the proximity of shafts 12a and 12b and thus, jaw members 110 and 120, may be
determined based on the reaction of the reed switch 81a to the magnetic element 81b.

                                                  15
[0061] Any of the above discussed sensors, switches, and/or strain gauge(s) may be
incorporated within an electrical circuit such that the strain detected by the strain gauge changes
the electrical signal through the circuit. With this purpose in mind, an electrical circuit between
the strain gauge and the switch 50 and/or an electrosurgical generator (not shown) allows
communication of information such as desired tissue pressure thereto. This information may be
tied to the activation of switch 50 such that the switch is not activated until a desired and/or
predetermined pressure on tissue grasped between jaw members 110 and 120 is achieved as
detected by the strain gauge. Accordingly, the strain gauge may be disposed strategically on the
forceps 10, e.g., on one or more of jaw members 110, 120, such that pressure applied to tissue
grasped between jaw members 110 and 120 affects the strain gauge.
[0062] In use, forceps 10 may be calibrated such that particular tactile responses (e.g., the first
tactile response) of switch 50 corresponds to a predetermined grasping pressure on tissue as
determined through use of one or more of the above discussed sensors, switches, and/or strain
gauge(s). The predetermined grasping pressure about tissue is within the range of about 3
kg/cm 2 to about 16 kg/cm 2 in one embodiment and, in another embodiment, about 7 kg/cm 2 to
about 13 kg/cm 2 . In some embodiments, switch 50 may generate multiple tactile responses,
each of which corresponds to different predetermined grasping force. For a more detailed
discussion of force sensing and/or measuring devices such as load cells, strain gauges, etc.,
reference is made to commonly-owned U.S. Application No. 11/409,154, filed on April 21,
2006.
[0063] As shown in Figs. 2, 4B, and 4C, the pivot 65 connects through an aperture 125 defined
through jaw member 120 and matingly engages a pivot plate 66 seated within a circumferential
lip or flange 78 (Fig. 4B) defined around the periphery of aperture 125 such that the pivot 65 is
rotatably movable within the aperture 125 to move jaw members 110 and 120 between open and
closed positions.
[0064] In some embodiments, actuation of the knife 85 is associated with activation of the
switch 50. For example, sensor 87 may be embodied as a position sensor configured to detect
the position of knife 85 relative to jaw members 110 and 120 and/or relative to tissue held
therebetween. Additionally or alternatively, sensor 87 may be configured to detect either of the
first and second tactile responses of switch 50 and allow or prevent actuation of the knife 85
accordingly. For example, based on feedback from the sensor 87, any one or more inter-

                                                    16
cooperating elements or lockout mechanisms associated with the actuating mechanism 40 may
be energized or de-energized to allow or prevent actuation of the knife 85, as described in more
detail below.
[0065] As shown in Fig. 7, knife 85 includes a step 86 that reduces the profile of the knife 85
toward a distal end thereof. The distal end of the knife 85 has a step 88 that increases the profile
of the knife 85 toward a sharpened distal cutting edge 89. The knife 85 includes a chamfered
portion 84 where the sharpened distal cutting edge 89 meets the step 88 to facilitate smooth
retraction of knife 85 through the knife channel 15.
[0066] In some embodiments, the forceps 10 may include a safety lockout mechanism having a
series of suitable inter-cooperating elements (e.g., anti-deployment link 47, trigger link 47) that
work together to prevent unintentional firing of the knife 85 when the jaw members 110 and 120
are disposed in the open position. Generally, the anti-deployment link 47 mechanically
cooperates with the trigger link 43 to prevent advancement of the knife 85 until the jaw
members 110 and 120 are closed about tissue. One such safety lockout mechanism for use with
forceps 10 is described in commonly-owned U.S. Application Serial No. 12/896,100 entitled
"Blade Deployment Mechanisms for Surgical Forceps", filed on October 1, 2010.
[0067] In some embodiments, any one or more of the inter-cooperating elements of the safety
lockout mechanism (e.g., anti-deployment link 47) may be electrically interconnected to the
switch 50 and include suitable electro-mechanical components (e.g., springs, rods, solenoids,
etc.) configured to be energized via activation of the switch 50 (e.g., via any one of leads 71 a,
71b, 71c, 71d, 71e) to mechanically manipulate the safety lockout mechanism. For example,
upon electrical conduction through leads 71d and 71e to energize the end effector 100, the anti
deployment link 47 is energized to cause actuation thereof such that the safety lockout
mechanism disengages to allow selective actuation of the knife 85. In this scenario, by way of
example, selective actuation of the knife 85 may be prevented until switch 50 has been
depressed to generate at least the first tactile response.
