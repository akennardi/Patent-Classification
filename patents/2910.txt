                                           ABSTRACT
         A flushable catheter assembly having features to enable selective activation of fluid
flow through the catheter assembly is disclosed herein. A septum is placed within the catheter
adapter of the catheter assembly and includes a pathway that is closed prior to being biased open
via a septum activator also positioned within the catheter adapter. A plurality of air vent channels
is interposed between the septum and the inner surface of the catheter adapter to permit
"flashback" of blood during insertion of the catheter into a patient. The septum activator is
advanced through the pathway of the septum as a coupler is attached to a proximal opening of
the catheter adapter.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0001]        The current invention relates to infusion devices, specifically to peripheral
intravenous (IV) catheters. In particular, the invention relates to a flushable peripheral IV
catheter assembly having features to enable selective activation of fluid flow through the catheter
assembly.
[0002]        Catheters are commonly used for a variety of infusion therapies. For example,
catheters are used for infusing fluids, such as normal saline solution, various medicaments, and
total parenteral nutrition into a patient, withdrawing blood from a patient, as well as monitoring
various parameters of the patient's vascular system.
[0003]        Catheters or needles are typically coupled to a catheter adapter to enable attachment
of IV tubing to the catheter. Thus, following placement of the catheter or needle into the
vasculature of a patient, the catheter adapter is coupled to a fluid source via a section of IV
tubing. In order to verify proper placement of the needle and/or catheter in the blood vessel, the
clinician generally confirms that there is "flashback" of blood in a flashback chamber of the
catheter assembly.
[0004]        Once proper placement of the catheter is confirmed, the clinician must then attach
the catheter adapter to a section of IV tubing. This process requires the clinician to manually
occlude the vein to prevent undesirable exposure to blood. Manual occlusion of the patient vein
requires the clinician to awkwardly maintain pressure on the vein of the patient while
simultaneously coupling the catheter adapter and the IV tubing.
[0005]        A common, yet undesirable practice is to permit blood to temporarily and freely
flow from the catheter adapter while the clinician locates and couples the IV tubing to the
catheter adapter. Another common practice is to attach the catheter adapter to the IV tubing prior
to placing the needle or catheter into the vein of the patient. While this method may prevent
undesirable exposure to blood, positive pressure within the IV line may also prevent desirable
flashback.
[0006]        Complications associated with infusion therapy include significant morbidity
and even mortality.      Such complications may be caused by regions of stagnant fluid
flow within the vascular access device or nearby areas of the
                                                  -1-

extravascular system. These are regions in which the flow of fluid is limited or non
existent due to the conformation of the septum or valve mechanism in the
extravascular system or the fluid dynamics within that area of the extravascular
system. Blood, air bubbles or infused medications may become trapped within these
regions of stagnant flow as a result of the limited or non-existent fluid flow. When
blood is trapped within the extravascular system bacteria can breed which can lead to
infections. When a different medication is infused into the extravascular system, or
the extravascular system is exposed to physical trauma, the extravascular system's
fluid flow may become altered, releasing trapped air bubbles or residual medications
back into the active fluid path of the extravascular system. This release of air bubbles
and residual medication into the active fluid path extravascular system may result in
significant complications.
[0007]          Released air bubbles may block fluid flow through the extravascular
system and prevent its proper functioning. More seriously, released air bubbles may
enter the vascular system of the patient and block blood flow, causing tissue damage
and even stroke. In addition, residual medications may interact with presently infused
medications to cause precipitates within the extravascular system and prevent its
proper functioning. Furthermore, residual medications may enter the vascular system
of the patient and cause unintended and/or undesired effects.
[0008]          Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a catheter assembly that
permits controlled, desirable flashback without the risk of encountering undesirable
exposure to blood.       Furthermore, there is a need in the art to provide a valve
mechanism in a catheter assembly that eliminates, prevents, or limits regions of
stagnant flow within vascular access devices and extravascular system to provide
better flush properties. Such a catheter assembly is disclosed herein.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0009]          In order to overcome the limitations discussed above, the present
invention relates to a flushable peripheral IV catheter assembly having features to
enable selective activation of fluid flow through the catheter assembly. The catheter
assembly of the present invention generally includes a catheter coupled to a catheter
adapter. The catheter generally includes a metallic material, such as titanium, surgical
steel or an alloy as is commonly known in the art. In some embodiments, a polymeric
                                          -2-

catheter may be used in combination with a metallic introducer needle, as is
commonly known and used in the art.
[0010]          In some embodiments of the present invention, a septum is positioned
within a lumen of the catheter assembly to prevent or limit flow of a fluid through the
catheter adapter. The septum generally includes a flexible or semi-flexible material
that is compatible with exposure to blood, medicaments, and other fluids commonly
encountered during infusion procedures. In some embodiments, a groove is provided
on an inner surface of the catheter adapter, wherein the septum is seated within the
groove. As such, the position of the septum within the catheter adapter is maintained.
[0011]          In some implementations of the present invention, a closed or partially
closed pathway, such as a slit or small hole is further provided in a barrier surface of
the septum. The pathway permits fluid to bypass the septum and flow though the
catheter adapter. In some embodiments, the pathway is a slit that is closed prior to
being opened or activated by a probe or septum activator positioned within the lumen
of the catheter adapter. Prior to being opened or activated, the slit prevents passage of
fluid through the catheter adapter. Thus, in some embodiments a plurality of air vent
channels are interposed between the septum and the groove to permit air flow through
the catheter adapter prior to the slit being opened. The air vents prevent buildup of
positive pressure within the catheter adapter thereby permitting flashback of blood
into the catheter and a forward chamber of the catheter adapter.
[0012]          The septum activator generally includes a plastic or metallic tubular
body having a probing end and a contact end. The probing end is positioned adjacent
to the pathway of the septum, and the contact end is positioned adjacent to a proximal
opening of the catheter adapter. The probing end of the septum activator is advanced
through the pathway of the septum when a probe is inserted into the proximal opening
of the catheter adapter.    As the probe contacts the contact surface of the septum
activator, the septum activator is advanced in a distal direction through the catheter
adapter whereupon the probing end of the septum activator opens the pathway through
the septum. Once opened, free flow of fluid is enabled through the catheter assembly.
[0013]          Finally, the presence of the septum activator within the lumen of the
catheter adapter may result in aberrant fluid flow leading to undesirable stagnation and
coagulation of fluids within the catheter assembly. Thus, in some embodiments of the
                                          -3-

present invention the septum activator further includes various flow deflectors and/or
flow diversion channels to maintain proper fluid flow within the catheter adapter.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0039]          The presently preferred embodiment of the present invention will be
best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers indicate
identical or functionally similar elements.    It will be readily understood that the
components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the
figures herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different
configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description, as represented in the
figures, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed, but is merely
representative of presently preferred embodiments of the invention.
[0040]          The term "proximal" is used to denote a portion of a device which,
during normal use, is nearest the user and furthest from the patient. The term "distal"
is used to denote a portion of a device which, during normal use, is farthest away from
the user wielding the device and closest to the patient. The term "activation" of valve
mechanism or septum is used to denote the action of opening or closing of such valve.
[0041]          An example of a prior art extravascular system is disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 7,008,404 and shown in Figures 1 to 3. An indwelling catheter has, as
shown in Figure 1, a hollow catheter body 1, a catheter 2 fitted into a holder lb
provided at a distal end of the catheter body 1, a septum 3 fitted inside the catheter
body 1, and a hollow pusher 4 slidably fitted inside the catheter body 1. The catheter
tube 2, septum 3, and the pusher 4 are coaxially aligned in this order.
[0042]          The catheter body 1 has a tubular shape. An inner surface la is tapered
toward the distal end, with a gradually reduced diameter.        The catheter body 1 is
preferably of a transparent or semi-transparent material so as to show the interior,
enabling checking of movement inside. Suitable materials for catheter body 1 include,
but are not limited to, thermoplastic polymeric resins such as polycarbonate,
polystyrene, polypropylene and the like.
                                         -6-

[0043]          The catheter 2 is press-fitted into the tube holder lb which
communicates at its proximal end with the inside of the catheter body 1. It is preferred
that a lubricating coating is provided to the entirety or part of the catheter 2 so as to
reduce resistance caused by insertion through skin or into a blood vessel. Suitable
materials for catheter 2 include, but are not limited to, thermoplastic resins such as
fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyurethane
and the like.     Preferably, catheter 2 is formed from a thermoplastic hydrophilic
polyurethane that softens with exposure to physiological conditions present in the
patient's body.
[0044]          The septum 3 is of a generally tubular shape having a proximal end 8
and a membrane section 9 having a planar flat surface 10 located at the distal end 11.
Typically, septum 3 further includes a single needle slit 3a or valve aperture located
about the centre of membrane section 9, extending through membrane section 9, to
facilitate penetration of septum 3 by introducer needle 5. The opposing slit surfaces of
the needle slit 3a are designed to closely conform to the shape of introducer needle 5
during storage and prevent an outflow of fluid during and following removal of the
introducer needle 5, then to seal upon removal of the introducer needle 5. With the
pusher 4 inserted therethrough, slit 3a expands forward in the distal direction and
opens, providing fluid communication between the catheter 2 and the rear of the
catheter body 1. An annular protrusion 3b is provided on the inner surface of a rear
opening of the septum 3, to engage shoulder 4c at the distal end of the pusher 4 so as
to limit the movement of pusher 4 in the proximal direction and prevent the
dislocation of the pusher 4 from septum 3. A plurality of gaps 3c are defined between
an outer periphery of the septum 3 and the inner surface la of the catheter body 1.
Distal and proximal spaces divided by the septum 3 communicate with each other
through the gaps 3c. Thus the septum 3 slides smoothly with air passing through the
gaps 3c.
[0045]          The pusher 4 is typically made from a rigid thermoplastic material or a
like material, and has a lumen extending therethrough. The pusher 4 has a tubular
portion 4a, a conical flange 4b connected to the rear proximal end of the tubular
portion 4a, and a shoulder 4c protruding from an outer periphery of the tubular portion
4a. Thus an annular shaped interstitial space is created between tubular portion 4a and
the inner surface 1a of the catheter body 1. The distal front end of the tubular portion
                                          -7-

4a is chamfered to facilitate its penetration into slit 3a of the septum 3, and is slidably
supported by the annular protrusion 3b of the septum 3. The conical flange 4b has a
conical inner surface so as to facilitate insertion of the needle 5 thereinto. The
peripheral surface of the flange 4b contacts the inner surface 1a of the catheter body 1
and serves to provide stability to the pusher 4 and maintain the coaxial position with
respect to the catheter 2. However the peripheral surface of the flange 4b does not
form a fluid seal with inner surface la.
[0046]           The indwelling catheter is prepared for use in such a state as shown in
Figure 1 with the front end of the needle 5 protruding from the front end of the
catheter 2. In this state, the needle 5 penetrates through the septum 3, providing water
tight connection therebetween, and thereby preventing leakage of blood.
[0047]           The indwelling catheter in this state is inserted into the body of a
patient. Then, as shown in Figure 2, the needle 5 is removed with the tube 2 retained
in the body of the patient. Septum 3 maintains a fluid seal upon removal of needle 5,
being retained catheter body 1 by an annular protrusion le. Pusher 4 is retained in a
proximal position buy the interaction of annular protrusion 3b and shoulder 4c.
[0048]           A connector 6 (e.g. a luer connector) of a vascular access device is then
inserted from the proximal end of the catheter body 1. When pressed into the catheter
body 1, the connector 6 pushes at its distal end the pusher 4. The pusher 4 thus slides
forward in distal direction to press at its distal end slit 3a of the septum 3 open thereby
activating the flow control valve to the open position. The septum 3 is then pressed
against the inner surface of a tapered cavity ic of the catheter body 1 which stops the
forward movement of pusher 4 at a distal position as shown in Figure 3, thus
providing communication between the catheter 2 and the vascular access device. The
tapered inner surface la of the catheter body 1 allows for smooth insertion of the
connector 6 and tight contact between an outer surface 6a of the connector 6 and the
inner surface la through press fitting in order to prevent fluid leaking out of the
proximal end of catheter body 1.
[0049]           However, it should be noted that this valve mechanism has small
interstitial spaces/areas within the catheter body 1 into which fluids can flow during
use, which give rise to areas of low or no fluid flow. For example, in use, fluid can
flow between the peripheral surface of the flange 4b and the inner surface la of
catheter body 1 and into the interstitial space 98 between the outer periphery of
                                           -8-

tubular portion 4a and the inner surface la. In addition, fluid can flow into interstitial
space 99 which is gap 3c between the outer periphery of septum 3 and the inner
surface 1a of the catheter body 1. The low or no fluid flow that exists in spaces/areas
98 and 99 makes it very difficult to subsequently flush out any blood, medicament or
air bubbles which may flow into these areas during use of the catheter.
[0050]          Referring now to Figure 4, a catheter assembly 101 is illustrated. The
catheter assembly 101 generally includes a catheter 12 coupled to a distal end 32 of a
catheter adapter 14. The catheter 12 and the catheter adapter 14 are integrally coupled
such that an internal lumen 16 of the catheter adapter 14 is in fluid communication
with a lumen 18 of the catheter 12.             The catheter 12 generally comprises a
biocompatible material having sufficient rigidity to withstand pressures associated
with insertion of the catheter into a patient. In some embodiments, the catheter 12
comprises a metallic material, such as titanium, stainless steel, nickel, molybdenum,
surgical steel, and alloys thereof. In other embodiments, the catheter 12 comprises a
rigid, polymer material, such as vinyl.      A tip portion 20 of the catheter is generally
configured to include a beveled cutting surface 48. The beveled cutting surface 48 is
utilized to provide an opening in a patient to permit insertion of the catheter 12 into
the vascular system of the patient.
[0051]          The features of the catheter assembly may be incorporated for use with
an over-the-needle catheter assembly.          For example, a flexible or semi-flexible
polymer catheter may be used in combination with a rigid introducer needle to enable
insertion of the catheter into a patient.    Surgically implanted catheters may also be
used.
[0052]          Once inserted into a patient, the catheter 12 and catheter adapter 14
provide a fluid conduit to facilitate delivery of a fluid to and/or retrieval of a fluid
from a patient, as required by a desired infusion procedure.                Thus, in some
embodiments the material of the catheter 12 and the catheter adapter 14 are selected to
be compatible with bio-fluids and medicaments commonly used in infusion
procedures. Additionally, in some embodiments a portion of the catheter 12 and/or
catheter adapter 14 is configured for use in conjunction with a section of intravenous
tubing 40 to further facilitate delivery of a fluid to or removal of a fluid from a patient.
[0053]          In some embodiments, a proximal end 22 of the catheter adapter 14
includes a flange 28.      The flange 28 provides a positive surface which may be
                                           -9-

configured to enable coupling of an intravenous tubing or patient conduit 40 to the
catheter assembly 101. In some embodiments, the flange 28 includes a set of threads
30. The threads 30 are generally provided and configured to compatibly receive a
complementary set of threads 44 comprising a portion of a male luer or conduit
coupler 42.    The conduit coupler 42 is generally coupled to an end portion of the
patient conduit 40 in a fluid-tight manner. In some embodiments, an inner portion of
the conduit coupler 42 is extended outwardly to provide a probe surface 46.
[0054]          The probe surface 46 is generally configured to compatibly insert
within a proximal end 22 of the catheter adapter 14. Following insertion of the probe
46 into the proximal end 22 of the catheter adapter 14, the conduit coupler 42 is
rotated to interlock the coupler 42 and the flange 28 (via the sets of threads 30 and
44). During the process of interlocking the coupler 42 and the flange 28, the probe 46
is advanced into the lumen 16 of the catheter adapter 14 to an inserted position (as
shown in Figure 8).     The inserted position of the probe surface 46 activates the
catheter assembly 101 to enable flow of fluid through the catheter 12 and catheter
adapter 14. Once the conduit coupler 42 and the catheter adapter 14 are attached, a
fluid may be delivered to a patient via the patient conduit 40 and the inserted catheter
 12.
[0055]          Referring now to Figure 5A, an exploded, cross-sectional view of a
catheter assembly 101 is shown.       In some embodiments, the catheter adapter 14
includes various design features and components to control and/or limit flow of fluid
through the catheter assembly 101. For example, in some embodiments of the present
invention a septum 50 is positioned within the inner lumen 16 of the catheter adapter
 14.  The septum 50 generally comprises a flexible, or semi-flexible polymer plug
having an outer diameter that is configured to compatibly seat within a groove or
channel 60 formed on an inner surface 24 of the catheter adapter 14.           In some
embodiments, the septum 50 is barrel shaped having a barrier surface 52 comprising a
distal end of the septum 50 and further having an opening 54 comprising a proximal
end of the septum 50. When positioned within the channel 60, the barrier surface 52
of the septum 50 divides the inner lumen 16 of the catheter adapter 14 into a forward
fluid chamber 62 and a rearward fluid chamber 64. Thus, the presence of the septum
50 controls or limits passage of fluid between the forward and rearward fluid
chambers 62 and 64. Specifically, a chosen configuration of the barrier surface 52 of
                                        -10-

the septum 50 largely determines the ability of a fluid to flow through the inner lumen
 16 of the catheter adapter 14.
[0056]           For example, in some embodiments the barrier surface 52 of the
septum 50 is configured to include a slit 56. The slit 56 is configured to provide
selective access or flow of a fluid through the barrier surface 52.             In some
embodiments, slit 56 is configured to remain in a closed, fluid-tight position until
activated or opened by advancing a septum activator 80 through the slit 56 in a distal
direction 390. In some embodiments, the barrier surface 52 comprises one slit 56. In
other embodiments, the barrier surface 52 is modified to include multiple slits 56 and
66, as shown in Figure 8.
[0057]           For some infusion therapy techniques, it may be desirable to permit a
controlled flow of fluid through the septum 50 prior to activating the septum 50 with
the septum activator 80. Thus, in some embodiments the slit 56 further comprises a
leak orifice 58.     The leak orifice 58 is positioned in the barrier surface 52 and
comprises an opening diameter calculated to permit controlled flow of liquid or air
between the forward and rearward chambers 62 and 64. In some embodiments, the
barrier surface 52 is modified to include a single leak orifice 58.             In other
embodiments, the barrier surface 52 is configured to include multiple leak orifices.
Still, in other embodiments the barrier surface 52 does not include a slit 56, but rather
includes at least one leak orifice 58. For these embodiments, the septum 50 generally
comprises an elastic material such that when the septum activator 80 is advanced in a
distal direction 390, a leading edge 92 of the septum activator 80 contacts the barrier
surface 52 and stretches the leak orifice 58 to provide a larger orifice thereby
permitting increased flow of air and/or fluid through the catheter adapter 14.
[0058]           The groove or channel 60 into which the septum is seated comprises a
recessed portion of the inner surface 24 of the catheter adapter 14. The outer diameter
of the septum 50 is generally configured to compatibly and securely seat within the
channel 60. For example, in some embodiments the outer diameter of the septum 50
is selected to be both slightly smaller than the diameter of the channel 60 and slightly
larger than the diameter of the inner lumen 16. As such, the septum 50 is retained
within the channel 60 during use of the catheter assembly 101.
[0059]           For some infusion therapy techniques, air flow between the forward
and rearward chambers 62 and 64 may be desirable.              For example, for those
                                         -11-

embodiments comprising a septum 50 having a fluid-tight slit 56, passage of air from
the forward chamber 62 to the rearward chamber 64 is prohibited prior to opening or
activating the septum 50 via the septum activator 80, as previously discussed. Thus,
when the catheter 12 of the catheter assembly 101 is inserted into the vascular system
of a patient, a positive pressure develops within the forward chamber 62 thereby
preventing a desired flashback of the patient's blood into the catheter adapter 14. An
observable flashback is generally desirable to confirm accurate placement of the
catheter tip 20 within the vein of the patient. Thus, some embodiments of the present
invention include features or elements to enable airflow between the forward chamber
62 and the rearward chamber 64, without requiring activation of the septum 50 with
the septum activator 80. As such, some embodiments of the present invention provide
an observable flashback, as generally desired for infusion procedures.
[0060]          For example, in some embodiments the barrier surface 52 of the
septum 50 is modified to include leak orifice 58, as previously discussed. In other
embodiments, a plurality of air vent channels 70 is interposed between the septum 50
and the inner surface 24 of the catheter adapter 14. The air vent channels 70 relieve
the positive pressure within the forward chamber 62 by providing an access for air to
bypass the septum 50 into the rearward chamber 64. In some embodiments, the air
vent channels 70 are constructed by removing portions of the channel 60 surface,
resulting in a plurality of generally parallel grooves.
[0061]          In addition to permitting air flow between the forward and rearward
chambers 62 and 64, the vent channels 70 may be configured to permit fluid to flow
through the catheter adapter 14 prior to activating or opening the slit 56 with the
septum activator 80. In some embodiments, the rate at which air and/or fluid flows
between the forward and rearward chambers 62 and 64 is adjusted by manufacturing
the catheter adapter 14 to include a greater or lesser number of vent channels 70. In
other embodiments, the rate at which air and/or fluid flows between the forward and
rearward chambers 62 and 64 is adjusted by manufacturing the catheter adapter 14 to
include vent channels 70 having a greater or lesser cross-sectioned area. Thus, in
some embodiments the rate at which air and/or fluid flows between the forward and
rearward chambers 62 and 64 is increased by manufacturing a catheter adapter 14
having either an increased number of vent channels 70, or vent channels 70 having a
greater cross-sectioned area. Conversely, in other embodiments the rate at which air
                                          -12-

and/or fluid flows between the forward and rearward chambers 62 and 64 is decreased
by manufacturing a catheter adapter 14 having either a decreased number of vent
channels 70, or vent channels 70 having a lesser cross-sectioned area.
[0062]          With continued reference to Figure 5A, the septum activator 80
comprises a probe-like structure that is primarily housed in the rearward chamber 64
of the catheter adapter 14.      The septum activator 80 generally comprises a tubular
body 82 having a distal end 84 and a proximal end 86. The tubular body 82 comprises
a rigid or semi-rigid material, such as a plastic or metallic material. The tubular body
82 further comprises an inner lumen 88 for facilitating flow of a fluid and/or liquid
through the septum activator 80.
[0063]          The distal end 84 of the tubular body 82 is configured to compatibly
insert within the opening 54 of the septum 50. The distal end 84 further includes a
probing surface 90 which extends through the opening 54 of the septum 50 to a
position proximal to the barrier surface 52 of the septum 50, as shown in Figure 8.
The probing surface 90 is advanced through the slit 56 and 66, or through the leak
orifice 58 as the septum activator is advanced through the catheter adapter 14 in a
distal direction 390.     Advancement of the septum activator 80 through the catheter
adapter 14 will be discussed in detail below, in connection with Figures 7 and 8.
[0064]          Still, in other embodiments the septum 50 is coated with a hydrophobic
coating, or a polymeric swelling coating to repel or prevent fluid from flowing
through the vent channels 70. A hydrophobic coating is generally selected to reduce
the surface energy of the septum 50 and/or adapter 14 to inhibit blood wicking into the
air vents 70. In some embodiments, a surface of the septum 50 or catheter adapter 14
is coated with a polyxylylene polymer material, such as parylene.          Parylene is a
chemically resistant coating with good barrier properties for inorganic and organic
fluids, strong acids, caustic solutions, gases and water vapors. In some embodiments,
a parylene coating is applied to the outer surface of the septum 50 via vapor
deposition. In other embodiments, a polyxylylene polymer coating is applied to a vent
channel 70 via vapor deposition.
[0065]          In some embodiments, a dehydrated polymer material is applied to a
surface of the septum 50 or catheter adapter 14 which comprises the vent channels 70.
A dehydrated polymer is generally selected to expand or swell upon contact with
fluid. As such, when the dehydrated polymer swells, a flow through the vent channels
                                          -13-

70 is blocked or occluded by the swollen polymer. Initially, the dehydrated polymer
generally comprises a thin profile prior to exposure to moisture.        However, when
exposed to moisture the polymer absorbs the moisture which increases the profile of
the polymer to block flow through the vent 70.      Therefore, by coating the septum 50
and/or catheter adapter 14 with a desired coating, flow of air is permitted between the
forward and rearward chambers 62 and 64, yet fluid flow through the vent channels 70
is prevented.
[0066]          Referring now to Figure 5B, an embodiment of a septum 150 is shown.
In some embodiments, an outer surface 166 of the septum 150 is modified to include a
plurality of recessed grooves 72. The recessed grooves 72 provide pathways between
the forward and rearward chambers 62 and 64 through which air and/or fluid may
flow. Thus, in some embodiments the channel 60 does not include air vent channels
70, but rather the outer surface 166 of the septum 150 is modified to provide desired
flow between the forward and rearward chambers 62 and 64.
[0067]          The blood pressure of the patient is largely responsible for the rate at
which blood and air flows through the septum 50 and 150 of the catheter assembly
101. As such, the flow rate through the system is affected by the combined effective
hydraulic diameter of all flow paths.      Thus, in some embodiments the hydraulic
diameter of the vent channels 70 and/or recessed grooves 72 are modified to increase
or decrease the rate of flow through the catheter assembly 101. In other embodiments,
the hydraulic diameter of the vent channels 70 and/or recessed grooves 72 are
decreased thereby resulting in substantially reduced or stopped flow through the
ventilation means. The governing equation for controlling the flow rate through the
ventilation means is given in Equation 1, where BP is the blood pressure, A is the
surface area of the ventilation means, 6 is the surface tension of the blood, and P is the
perimeter of the ventilation means.
[0068]          Equation 1:     BP(A)= 6(P)
[0069]          Thus, according to Equation 1, when the perimeter of the ventilation
means is small, the ventilation means will allow air venting, but will prevent blood
flow due to the relatively high surface tension (6) of blood. However, when the
perimeter of the ventilation means is increased, the surface tension between the blood
and the vent is decreased thereby enabling the blood to slowly leak through the vents
and around the septum to provide desirable, yet controlled flashback. Therefore, by
                                        -14-

adjusting the various variable of Equation 1, a desired flow will be achieved. Thus,
based on the size and/or number of vents around the septum, the catheter assembly
design will provide customized, controlled and predictable blood flow around the
septum 50 or 150. In some embodiments, it is desirable to permit slow, controlled
blood flow as a means for providing a visual indicator that the catheter is in the blood
vessel, without the risk of immediate exposure to the blood. In other embodiments, it
is desirable to only permit air to pass through the vents.
[0070]           Referring now to Figure 6A, a cross-section view of an interior lumen
of a catheter adapter 14 is shown. In some embodiments, catheter adapter 14 includes
a forward fluid chamber 62 and a rearward fluid chamber 64 fluidly connected via a
narrowed channel or port 160.        As configured and in some embodiments, a fluid
pathway 170 is defined whereby a fluid 146 flows downstream from the rearward
fluid chamber 64, through the port 160 and into the forward fluid chamber 62. The
fluid pathway 170 continues through the forward fluid chamber 62 and exits the distal
end 32 into a catheter (not shown) or other downstream conduit. While fluid 146 fills
the entire lumen of the catheter adapter 14, the fluid pathway 170 is generally
restricted to a narrow pathway through a central portion of the cross-section of the
catheter adapter 14.     Accordingly, fluid 146 that is not part of the narrow fluid
pathway 170 stagnates or circulates within dead zones 156. Fluid 146 trapped within
these dead zones is prevented from sufficiently mixing with fluid 146 in the fluid
pathway 170.       In some embodiments, stagnation results in increased, localized
concentrations of chemicals, bodily fluids and/or medicaments that may lead to
precipitation, coagulation or administration of dangerously high doses of medications.
Therefore, in some embodiments of the present invention, a septum activator 80 is
provided having features to eliminate dead zones 156 within the catheter adapter 14
lumen.
[0071]           Referring now to Figure 6B, a perspective view of the septum activator
80 is shown.      In some embodiments, the distal end 84 of the tubular body 82
comprises a first diameter 100 that is less than a second diameter 102 of the proximal
end 86.    The narrower distal end 84 is configured to compatibly insert within the
opening 54 of the septum 50, while the wider proximal end 86 is configured to
compatibly seat within the rearward chamber 64 of the catheter adapter 14. In some
                                          -15-

embodiments, the septum activator further includes a tapered middle section 104 to
couple the distal 84 and proximal 86 ends.
[0072]          In some embodiments, the proximal end 86 of the septum activator 80
further includes a retention spring 110. The retention spring 110 generally comprises
an outwardly biased portion of the tubular body 82 configured to compatibly engage a
septum activator retention groove 68, as shown in Figures 5A, and 7-8.               The
interaction between the retention spring 110 and the groove 68 limits the lateral
movement of the septum activator 80 within the lumen 16 of the catheter adapter 14.
Thus, the width of the retention groove 68 determines or limits the distance of travel
for the septum activator 80 within the catheter adapter 14.            Additionally, the
interaction between retention spring 110 and the groove 68 prevents removal of the
septum activator 80 from the catheter adapter 14. In some embodiments, the septum
activator 80 comprises a plurality of retention         springs   110, while in other
embodiments the septum activator 80 comprises a single retention spring 110.
[0073]          In some embodiments, the septum activator 80 further comprises
features for directing or diverting fluid flow around and/or through the septum
activator 80. Flow diversion may be important to prevent stagnation or coagulation of
fluids within dead zones 156 of the septum activator 80 and/or the lumen 16 of the
catheter adapter 14 resulting in blockages.      Additionally, stagnation of fluid flow
through the catheter assembly 101 may result in a build up of undesirable
concentrations of medicaments within the catheter adapter 14 and/or the septum
activator 80, as previously discussed.    Undesirable high concentrations may result in
ineffective treatment causing serious side effects, including death.     Thus, in some
embodiments the septum activator 80 is modified to include flow deflectors 120 and
flow diversion channels 130 to provide a flushable catheter assembly 101 system.
[0074]          The flow deflectors 120 generally comprise inwardly and outwardly
angled portions of the septum activator 80 outer surface. The flow deflectors 120 are
positioned so as to be protrude into a flow path through the catheter adapter 14. Thus,
as the fluid contacts the flow deflectors 120 the path of the fluid flow is disturbed.
This disturbance results in redirecting the fluid flow both through the inner lumen 88
of the septum activator 80, and between the outer surface of the septum activator 80
and the inner surface 24 of the catheter adapter 14.         In some embodiment, the
retention spring 110 also serves as a flow deflector 120.
                                         -16-

[0075]           A flow diversion channel 130 is provided to permit exchange of fluid
between the lumen of the catheter adapter 16 and the inner lumen 88 of the septum
activator 80. Thus, the flow diversion channel 130 prevents stagnation and/or clotting
of fluid between the inner surface 24 of the catheter adapter 14 and the outer surface
of the septum activator 80. In some embodiments, the flow diversion channel 130
comprises a window or opening in the surface of the tubular body 82.             In other
embodiments, the flow diversion channel 130 further comprises a flap or angled
surface to further direct fluid to flow through the channel 130.
[0076]           The proximal end 86 of the septum activator 80 further includes a
contact surface 140.      The contact surface 140 comprises the most proximal end
portion of the septum activator 80 and is positioned within the rearward chamber 64
of the catheter adapter 14 adjacent to the proximal opening 26 of the catheter adapter
14, as shown in Figure 7, below.
[0077]           Referring now to Figure 6C, an embodiment of a septum activator 180
is shown as positioned in the lumen of a catheter adapter 14 (shown in phantom). In
some embodiments, septum activator 180 is configured to include various re
circulation features.    For example, in some embodiments septum activator 180
includes various vents 200 configured to divert fluid from the fluid pathway 170 into
the dead zones 156. Thus, as fluid flows into and through the septum activator 180,
the fluid within the septum activator 180 passes through the vents 200 and into the
dead zones 156 between the outer surface of the activator 180 and the inner wall
surface of the catheter adapter 14. The diverted fluid intermixes with the fluid in the
dead zones 156 to flush fluid from the dead zones 156 and thus prevent stagnation
and/or overconcentration, as previously discussed.
[0078]           In some embodiments, septum activator 180 is further modified to
include flushing fins 220.        Flushing fins 220 generally comprise perpendicular
extension of the outer surface of the activator 180 that extend into the dead zones 156
between the activator 180 and the inner wall surface of the catheter adapter 14. The
flushing fins 220 are provided to divert and redirect fluid within the fluid pathway 170
into the dead zones 156. As such, fluid within the dead zones 156 is intermixed with
fluid in the fluid pathway 170 to prevent stagnation and/or overconcentration of fluid
within the catheter adapter 14.
                                           -17-

[0079]          Finally, in some embodiments the flow diversion channel 130 is
modified to include a flow deflector 230.       The flow deflector 230 comprises a
beveled, distal surface of the flow diversion channel 130 positioned to divert fluid
within the fluid pathway 170 into the dead zones 156 of the forward fluid chamber 62.
Thus, as fluid 146 flows through the septum activator 180, a portion of the fluid is
diverted through the flow diversion channel 130 and into the dead zone 156 via the
flow deflector 230, as shown in Figure 6D.
[0080]          With continued reference to Figure 6D, a cross-sectioned septum
activator 180 positioned within a cross-sectioned catheter adapter 14. As previously
discussed, recirculation features may be added to both the proximal 86 and distal 186
ends of the septum activator 180. In some embodiments, the proximal end 86 of the
septum activator 180 is modified to include curved window features 240 that redirect
the flow of a fluid 246 into the dead zones 156 of the rearward fluid chamber 64.
Thus, the curved surface 242 of the window feature 240 alone and/or in combination
with the other recirculation features promotes intermixing of the fluid within the dead
zones 156 to prevent stagnation and overconcentration of fluids within the catheter
adapter 14.
[0081]          In some embodiments, the recirculation features are positioned in a
symmetrical configuration to induce best flushing.         In other embodiments, the
recirculation features are positioned in an asymmetrical configuration to induce best
flushing.    Finally, in some embodiments the recirculation features are used in
combination with additional diffusing, circulating and recirculating features of the
septum activator 180 to aid the fluid flushing capability of the septum activator 180.
In light of the foregoing disclosure, additional surfaces of the septum activator 180
may be modified to increase or decrease flow efficiency, mixing and flushing of fluids
within the septum activator 180, as desired.
[0082]          Referring now to Figure 7, a cross-sectional view of the assembled
catheter assembly 101 is shown prior to activation of the septum 50 via the septum
activator 80. Prior to activation, the septum activator 80 is entirely positioned within
the rearward fluid chamber 64 of the catheter adapter 14. Additionally, the retention
springs 110 are engaged within the retention groove 68 and positioned near the
proximal end of the retention groove 68.      The contact surface 140 of the septum
activator 80 is positioned near the opening 26 of the catheter adapter 14, such that a
                                         -18-

proximal opening 142 of the septum activator 80 is in a plane generally parallel to the
plane of the catheter adapter opening 26.       Finally, the outwardly biased retention
springs 110 bind on the surface of the groove 68 thereby maintaining the inactivated
position of the septum activator 80 within the catheter adapter 14.
[0083]          Referring now to Figure 8, a cross-sectional view of the catheter
assembly 101 is shown following activation of the septum 50 via the septum activator
80. Upon insertion of the coupler 42 into the proximal opening 26 of the catheter
adapter 14, the probe portion 46 of the coupler 42 contacts the contact surface 140 of
the septum activator 80. The septum activator 80 is advanced in a distal direction 390
as the coupler 42 is further inserted into the proximal opening 26 of the catheter
adapter 14. As the coupler 42 is advanced further into the proximal opening 26, the
probing surface 90 of the septum activator 80 passes through the barrier surface 52 of
septum 50. As such, the probing surface 90 of the septum activator 80 is positioned
within the forward chamber 62 providing a fluid pathway through the septum 50.
[0084]          In some embodiments, the catheter assembly 101 is configured to
permit the septum activator 80 to return to a position entirely within the rearward
chamber 64 following removal of the coupler 42 from the catheter adapter 14. Thus,
when the coupler 46 is removed or detached from the catheter assembly 101, the fluid
pathway through the septum 50 is reclosed.        In some embodiments, the retention
spring 110 is configured to flex inwardly upon contact between the contact surface
140 of the septum activator 80 and the probe 46 of the coupler 42. When the retention
spring 110 flexes inwardly, the probing surface 90 of the septum activator 80 is
temporarily advanced in a distal direction 390 to bias open the slits 66 and 56, or the
leak orifice 58.   When contact between the probe 46 and the contact surface 140
ceases, the retention spring 110 returns to its relaxed position. The relaxed position
withdrawals the probing surface 90 of the septum activator 80 from the barrier surface
52 thereby permitting closure of the slits 66 and 56.
[0085]          Referring now to Figure 9, a cross-sectional view of a catheter
assembly 300 is shown incorporating an introducer needle 350. The proximal end 352
of the needle 350 may be coupled to a needle hub (not shown) or an insertion
assembly (not shown) to facilitate a user in holding and manipulating the needle 350
during catheterization. For purposes of clarity in the present illustration the remainder
of the needle assembly has been removed.
                                         -19-

[0086]          Prior to activation, septum activator 380 is entirely positioned within
the rearward chamber 364 of catheter adapter 314. A pathway is provided through the
inner lumen 316 of the activator 380 so as to allow passage of introducer needle 350.
A middle portion of the needle 350 passes through septum 356 and continues through
the forward chamber 362 and into the flexible catheter 312. A tip portion (not shown)
of the needle 350 extends beyond a tip portion (not shown) of the catheter 312 such
that the needle tip is available to gain access to the vasculature of a patient.
[0087]          The slit 366 of septum 356 is biased open by introducer needle 350. In
some embodiments, a seal is formed between the outer surface of the needle 350 and
the slit 366. Thus, fluid and air flow are prevented from bypassing the septum by way
of the interface between the needle 350 and the slit 366. In some embodiments, a
channel or pathway is provided between the slit 366 and the needle 350 to permit
controlled leakage or flow between these two components.
[0088]          In other embodiments, a lubricant such as a non-wetting lubricant is
applied to the interface between the needle 350 and the slit 366 to further eliminate
possible leakage of fluid and/or air. A non-wetting lubricant may also be beneficial to
prevent tearing or other damage to the slit that may occur when the needle is removed
from the catheter assembly following catheterization. A non-wetting lubricant may
also facilitate proper realignment of the slit 366 halves following removal of the
needle 350. Non-limiting examples of a non-wetting lubricant include known Teflon
based non-wetting materials such as Endura, from Endura Coating Co.; A20, E-20,
1000-S20, FEP Green, PTFE and X-40 from Tiodize; Cammie 2000 from AE Yale;
21845 from Ladd Research; MS 122-22, MS 122DF, MS-143DF, MS-122V MS
122VM, MS143V, MS-136W, MS-145W, U0316A2, U0316B2, MS-123, MS-125,
MS-322 and MS-324 from Miller-Stepheson; and 633T2 from Otto Bock can also be
used. Various non-Teflon based non-wetting lubricant type materials include Dylyn,
from ART; Nyebar, Diamonex, NiLAD, TIDLN, Kiss-Cote, Titanium oxide; Fluocad
Fluorochemical Coating FC-722, from 3M; Permacote from Dupont; Plasma Tech
1633 from Plasma Tech, Inc.; and silicone sprays.
[0089]          In some embodiments, distal end 384 of the septum activator 380 is
elongated such that contact surface 340 is positioned closer to proximal opening 326
of the catheter adapter 314. Accordingly, a coupler having a shortened probe portion
(not shown) may sufficiently contact the contact surface 340 to advance the distal end
                                          -20-

384 through the septum 356. In other embodiments, the distal end 384 of the septum
activator 380 is configured to include an inner diameter of substantially the same size
and the outer diameter of the introducer needle 350. As such the inner diameter of the
distal end 384 is configured to allow passage of the needle 350 while maintaining
minimal tolerance 382 between the outer surface of the needle 350 and the inner
surface of the septum activator 380 distal end 384.        This minimal tolerance 382
provides a seal thereby preventing leakage or flow of blood between the needle 350
and the septum activator 380 while withdrawing the needle 350 from the catheter
assembly 300.
[0090]          In some embodiments, a translating groove 368 is provided within the
rearward chamber 364. The translating groove 368 generally comprises an annular
recess having a determined length 370. Translating groove 368 is further configured
to receive flushing fins 320 such that the flushing fins 320 are retained within the
groove 368. Thus, length 370 represents the maximum lateral distance which septum
activator 380 is permitted to travel within the rearward chamber 364.           In some
embodiments, a proximal end of groove 368 is defined by an annular ridge 372. In
other embodiments, a distal end of groove 368 is defined by a second annular ridge
374. Still, in other embodiments the second annular ridge 374 forms a proximal end
of septum channel 60.
[0091]          Referring now to Figure 10, a cross-sectional view of catheter
assembly 300 is shown following removal of introducer needle 350. Upon removal of
introducer needle 350, slit 366 of septum 356 is no longer biased open and therefore
recloses and seals to prevent flow of fluids and/or air via the slit 366. As previously
discussed, in some embodiments slit 366 includes a leak orifice (not shown) to permit
controlled flow between the forward and rearward chambers 362 and 364. In other
embodiments, a plurality of ventilation channels 70 are provided between the outer
surface of the septum 356 and the septum channel 60.
[0092]          Referring now to Figures 1 A through 1lD, septum 356 may include
various configurations and features to stabilize distal end 384 of the septum activator
380.   For example, in some embodiments septum 356 is configured to include an
inner diameter 358 sized substantially equal to the outer diameter of the distal end 384
of septum activator 380, as shown in Figure 1 1A. In other embodiments, septum 356
is configured to have an interior annular ridge or protrusion 360 having an inner
                                        -21-

diameter 358 sized substantially equal to the outer diameter of distal end 384, as
shown in Figure 11B. Thus, in both of these embodiments distal end 384 is radially
supported by septum 356.
[0093]         With reference to Figure 1 1C, in some embodiments an interior surface
376 of septum 356 is modified to include one or more reliefs 391.               In some
embodiments, relief 391 comprises a concave annular recess configured to receive a
positive feature 392 comprising a portion of distal end 384 of the septum activator
380.    In other embodiments, relief 391 comprises a singular indent sized and
configured to receive feature 392 of the septum activator 380.           Still, in other
embodiments relief 391 comprises a positive feature and feature 392 comprises a
negative or recessed feature (not shown). Thus, in some embodiments the interaction
between relief 391 and feature 392 provides both radial support and axial retention of
the septum activator 380 within the catheter adapter 314.       This configuration may
eliminate the need for additional retention features, such as clips and retention
grooves.
[0094]          Referring now to Figure 1 1D, septum 356 includes a domed profile
394 to counteract pressure applied to the distal side 386 of the septum 356 following
removal of introducer needle 350.         The domed profile 394 provides additional
strength to the distal side 386 of the septum 356 thereby increasing the fluid pressure
required to defeat the septum 356. In some embodiments, as the blood reaches the
septum 356 the domed profile 394 assists the septum 356 in closing due to the
pressure from the blood flow within the forward chamber 362. In other embodiments,
septum 356 comprises a generally flat profile, as shown in Figures 5A, 5B and 7
through 1 IC or may include a combination of flat and curved surfaces (not shown).
[0095]          Referring now to Figure 12, a cross-sectional view of catheter
assembly 300 is shown following activation of septum 356 via septum activator 380.
Upon insertion of a coupler 342 into the proximal opening 326 of the catheter adapter
314, the probe portion 346 of the coupler 342 contacts the contact surface 340 of
septum activator 380.      Septum activator 380 is accordingly advanced in a distal
direction 390 as the coupler 342 is further inserted into proximal opening 326 thereby
causing flushing fins 320 to translate within translating groove 368. As coupler 342 is
advanced further into the proximal opening 326, probing surface 348 of the septum
activator 380 passes through the slit 366 of septum 356. As such, the probing surface
                                         -22-

348 of the septum activator 380 is positioned within the forward chamber 362
providing a fluid pathway through the septum 356.
[0096]          Referring now to Figures 13 through 20, a number of valves in
accordance with some embodiments are shown which aim to further eliminate or
reduce areas of low or no fluid flow occurring within a vascular access device
containing a valve mechanism comprising a septum and septum activator or pusher.
[0097]          Figures 13 and 14 show an embodiment of the invention in which a
sleeve 45 is used to prevent fluid from flowing into any interstitial spaces which are
low or no flow fluid areas.
[0098]          Figure 13 shows a septum 43 which forms a fluidic seal in the lumen
341 of catheter body 41 after removal of the needle, with septum activator or pusher
344 in the proximal position. Sleeve 45 is attached around pusher 344 to form a fluid
seal between an outer periphery 53 of proximal portion 348 of pusher 344 and inner
surface 354 of lumen 341.       Thus, no fluid can flow between the proximal end of
pusher 344 and the inner surface 354 of lumen 341 into the interstitial space 498.
Figure 14 shows pusher 344 in the distal position in which fluid can only flow via the
lumen 51 of pusher 344.        Sleeve 45 still maintains a fluidic seal between outer
periphery 53 of pusher 344 and inner surface 54 of lumen 341. Thus, no fluid can
flow into the interstitial spaces 498. In addition, the tapered outer surface 351 of the
distal portion of sleeve 45 reduces the size of the interstitial space 498 when pusher
344 is in the distal position. Sleeve 45 is made from a softer elastomeric material,
such as liquid silicone rubber for example, and is attached to pusher 344 through
suitable molding procedures, such as insert molding, injection molding, and other
molding techniques or a combination of molding techniques.
[099]           Figures 15 and 16 show another embodiment of the invention having
valve mechanism which uses a seal at the proximal end 65 and distal end 75 of a
tubular septum activator 365, to prevent fluid from flowing into interstitial spaces 698
and 699 between activator 365 and the inner surface 74 of the lumen 363 of the
catheter body 61.   Distal seal 75 is incorporated into septum 63 to prevent any fluid
flowing between the distal end of activator 365 and the proximal surface of septum 63
when pusher is in the proximal position as shown in Figure 15 or the distal position as
shown in Figure 16. Proximal seal 65 is a continuous torus or toroidal-shaped band
around the outer circumference of the proximal end of activator 365 which forms a
                                         -23-

fluid seal with the inner surface 74 of the lumen 363 of the catheter body 61 in both
the proximal and distal activator positions. The proximal seal 65 is made from a
softer elastomeric material, such as liquid silicone rubber for example and is over
molded onto activator 365 and retained in position by lip 367 on the outer surface of
the proximal end of activator 365. Activator 365 has a number of fins 369 extending
from and evenly distributed around the circumference of the outer surface 371. These
fins 369 are sufficiently long to contact a portion 73 of the inner surface 74 of lumen
363 and are used to limit the movement of activator 365 along the catheter body by
contact with the septum 63 in the distal direction and contact with indent or step 378
of the inner surface 74 in the proximal direction.
[0100]           Figures 17 through 20 show some embodiments having valve
mechanisms which are configured to exclude small confined interstitial spaces,
thereby eliminating areas of no to low fluid flow.
[0101]           Figures 17 and 18 show an embodiment in which the septum 83
encases the majority of activator 383. Activator 383 includes a head section, tubular
section and a plunger. Plunger 381 which has a diameter at least equal to that of
lumen 385 of the catheter body 81 such that no fluid can pass between the inner
surface 94 and plunger 80 is located at the proximal end of activator 383. Septum 83
has an external diameter at least equal to that of lumen 82 along its entire length such
that no interstitial space is present between septum 83 and inner surface 94 of lumen
385. In addition, septum 83 has a lumen 85, the internal diameter of which is equal to
the external diameter of tubular section 87 of activator 383 thereby forming an
additional fluid seal along the length of tubular section 87. Furthermore, the relative
lengths of activator 383 and septum 83 are such that the distal face 389 of plunger 381
is in intimate contact with the proximal end 388 of septum 83 when activator 383 is in
the distal position, as shown in Figure 18. Thus, there is no interstitial space between
plunger 381 and septum 83. The head section is located at the distal end of activator
383 and includes longitudinal slots 387 in the side wall of lumen 91 in order to allow
fluid flow to diverge out of lumen 91 of activator 383 and reduce the possibility of a
no or low flow area 393 around the distal face of septum 83 at the inner surface 74.
[0102]           Figures 19 and 20 show a further embodiment of a valve mechanism in
which a septum 103 includes a tubular section 107 having a distal end 108 and a
membrane section 109 having a proximal planar surface located at the proximal end
                                          -24-

 105. The tubular section 107 of septum 103 is substantially disposed within septum
housing 111 and is prevented from distal movement by shoulder or annular recess 121
formed in surface of lumen 385. A fluidic seal is formed between the periphery of
membrane section 109 and inner surface 114 of the proximal section 110 of lumen
385 to prevent fluid leakage past septum 103 when the valve is closed. In some
embodiments, septum 103 further includes a needle slit 113 or valve aperture located
about the centre of membrane section 109, extending through membrane section 109,
to facilitate penetration of septum 103 by introducer needle 5. A septum activator 304
is located in the proximal section of lumen 385 and includes a tubular portion 115. In
some embodiments, tubular or sleeve portion 115 further includes a plurality of
longitudinal slots or flow channels 116 in the side wall, distributed evenly around the
circumference of tubular potion 115 and located at the distal or actuating end 117 such
that a gap is formed between the actuating end 117 and membrane 109.
[0103]           Figure 19 shows septum activator 304 in the proximal position
following removal of introducer needle 5.       In particular, the actuating end 117 of
septum activator 304 is positioned against the proximal planar surface of membrane
section 109 of septum 103 to form an interface.         The diameter of lumen 385 in
proximal section 310 is approximately equal to the external diameter of connector 106
(e.g. a luer connector) of a vascular access device, septum activator 304 and
membrane section 109, such that there are no interstitial spaces between the connector
 106 (shown in Figure 20), a contact end of septum activator 304 and membrane
section 109. The inner surface 114 and proximal section 310 of the first lumen 385
are further sealed by membrane section 109.
[0104]           Referring now to Figure 20, septum activator 304 is shown in the distal
position whereby connector 106 has repositioned septum activator 304 forward in a
distal direction thereby causing actuating end 117 of septum activator 304 to deform
membrane section 109. This deformation results in the formation of a fluid pathway
whereby fluid bypasses membrane section 109 via slots 116, thereafter flowing
between periphery of membrane section 109 and inner surface 114, and guided
through opening 118 in the side wall of tubular portion 107. This divergent fluid path
around the periphery of membrane section 109 causes a turbulent fluid flow which
reduces the possibility of stagnation or a low flow area occurring near shoulder 119 in
                                         -25-

lumen 385. Fluid then continues to flow along the internal diameter of tubular portion
107 and into the distal section 112 of lumen 385.
[0105]          Any septum described herein may be made of a variety of suitable
materials and through a variety of suitable manufacturing methods. For example, the
septum may be formed from liquid silicone rubber through suitable molding
procedures, such as insert molding, injection molding, other molding techniques, or a
combination of molding techniques. The septum 103, or any septum described herein,
may also include a coating of antimicrobial substance on any of its surfaces, especially
those surfaces which have contact with fluid.
[0106]          The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without
departing from its structures, methods, or other essential characteristics as broadly
described herein and claimed hereinafter.      The described embodiments are to be
considered in all respects only as illustrative, and not restrictive. The scope of the
invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims, rather than by the foregoing
description. All changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of
the claims are to be embraced within their scope.
