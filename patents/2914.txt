                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
10            Illustrative embodinents of the invention are described below, In the interest of
   clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will
   of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous
                                                                                   t
    implementation-specific decions must be made to achieve the developers specific goals,
   such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary
15  from one implementation to another, Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a
   development effort, even if complex and time-consumingwould be a routine undertaking
    for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.
              As shown in FIG. 1, an embodiment of valve 10 of the invention includes a main
    housing 13 and two si lar end conuectoW portions I1, 1:2.
                                    ..
20            Main housing 13 is a hollow cylindrical piece with threaded portions 6.1 at each end
    that receive threaded portions 1$ of each end connector. End connectors II and 12 may be
    internally or externally threaded fbr connection to the casing string. As shown in FIG.-2,
    main housing 13 includes one or more openings 19, which are surrounded by a circular
    protective cover 40. Cover 40 is made of high impact strength material.
25            Valve 10 includes a nmandrel 30. which is formed as a hollow cylindrical tube
    extending between end connectors 11, 12 as shown in FiG,.2, Mandrel 30 includes one or
    more apertures 23 that extend through the outer wall of the mandrel, Mandrel 30 also has an
    exterior intermediate threaded portion 51. One or more rupture disks 41,42 are located in
    the mandrel as shown in FIG. 3. Rupture disks 41, 42 are located within passageways that
30  extend between the inner and outer surfaces of the mandrel 30. Annular recesses 17 and 27
    are provided in the outer surface of the mandrel for receiving suitable seals,
               Mandrel 30 is confined between end connectors 1.1 and 12 by engaging a shoulder
     15 in the interiotsuee of the end connectors. End connectors I I and 12 include
     longitudinally emending portions 18 that space apart outer housing 13 and mandrel 30 thus
35   forming a chamber 36, Portions 18 have an annular recess 32 for relieving a suitable seal. A
     sliding sleeve meter 20 is located within chamber 36 and is generally of a hollow

   cylindrical configuration as shown in FIG. 4. The sliding sleeve member,20 includes a
   smaller diameter portion 24 that is threaded at 66, Also it is provided with indentations 43
   that receive the end portions of shear pins 21, Sliding seeve meniber 20 also includes
   annular grooves 16 and 22 that accommodate suitable annular seals.
 5           A locking ring bolder 25 has ratchet teeth 61 and holds locking ring 50, which has
   ratchet teeth 51on its outer surface and ratchet teeth 55 on its inner surface as shown in F1G.
   9. Locking ring 50 includes an opening at 911 as shown in FIG. 7, which allows it to grow in
   diameter as the sliding sleeve moves from the closed to open position.
             Locking ring holder 25 has sufficient diameter clearance so that the locking ring can
10 ratchet on the-mandrel ratcheting teeth 63, yet never loose threaded contact with the lock
   ring holder. Looking ring holder 25 is threaded at:26 for engagetment with threads 24 on the
   mandrel. Locking ring holder 25 also has a plurality of bores 46 and 62 for set screws, not
   shown,
             In use, valve 10 may be connected to the easing string by end connectors 1.1, 12.
15 One or more valves 10 may be incorporated into the casing string. After the easing string is
   deployed within the well, cement is pumped down through the casing and out the bottom
   into the annuals between the well bore and the casing. as typical within the art. After the
   cenient flow is terminated, a plug or other device is pumped down to wipe the casing and
   valve clean of residual cement     When the plug or other device has loathed or sealed in the
20 bottom hole assembly, pressure is increased to rupture the rupture disk at apredeternined
   pressure. The fluid pressure will act on sliding sleeve member 20 to cause the shear pins to
   break and then to move it downward or to the right, as shown in FIG.7. This movement will
   allow fracing fluid to exit via opening 23 in the mandrel and openings 19 in the outer
   housing. The fracing fluid under pressure will remove protective cover 40 and crack the
25 cement casing and also fracture the foundation adjacent to the valve 10.
             Due to the fact that the sliding sleeve member 20 is mostly isolated from the cement
   flow, the sleeve will have a lesser tendency to jam or require more pressure for actuation.
             In the open position, locking ring 50.engages threads 63 on the mandrel to prevent
   the sleeve from moving back to the closed position.
30           A vent 37 is located in the outer housing 13 to allow air to exit when the valve is
   being assembled. The vent 37 is closed by a suitable plug after assembly.
              Referring now to FIG.,     t. :across-ectional view of a valve in a closed position
    according to an embodiment of the present disclosure is shown, Valve 100 is shown coupled
    to an upper tool assembly 106 and alower tool assembly 107. Upper tool assembly 106 and
35  lower tool assembly 107 may include any number oftools used in downhole operations
    including, for example, packers, sub-assemblies, flow cntrot equipintfl?Ietc. Valve 100,
                                                     4

    upper tool assembly 106, and lower tool assembly 107 are coupled through threadable
   connections 108. Inthis embodiment, valve 100 includes a housing 105 and a mandrel 11.0.
    Housing 105 and niandrel 110 may be formed from metals known to the art such as, for
   example, various grades of steel.
 S            Husing 105 has one or more openings 11 located around valve 100. The number,
    location, and size ofopeningb I I1 may vary depending on the requirements for a particular
   embodiment of valve 110. For example, in Certain embodiments, openings Ill may range
   from several inches to several feet in length, Additionally, the geometry of openings I11
   may vary depending on the requirements ota particular operation. For example, in certain
10 embodiments, openings 111 may be generally redangular while in other embodiments,
   openings 111 may be more round/cireular in geometry. Inaddition to openings Il1 in
   housing 105, valve 100 also includes one or more corresponding mandrel openings 112. The
   openings 112 of the mandrel 110 correspond in location to the openings 111 in the housing
    105, and as such, the geometry and size of mandrel 110 openings 112 may vary as housing
15  10$ openings I I I vary
             A sliding sleeve I15 is disposed between housing 105 and mandrel I 10. In this
   embodiment, a first chamber 120, is formed between housing 105 and mandrel I10, and is
   located axially above sliding sleeve 115, Similarlya second chamber 125 is formed
   between housing 105 and mandrel 110, and is located below sliding sleeve 1 5 First and
20 second chambers 120 and 125 are at atmosphere pressure when sliding sleeve I15 is in a
   closed position. Because the pressure in first and second chambers 120 and 125 is balanced,
   ixe, both chambers are at atmospheric pressureithe sliking sleeve does not move axially
   within the chambers 120 and 125, and thus valve 100 remains in a closed position.
             A passageway 130 is located axially above sliding sleeve 115 and fluidly connects
25 the inner diameter ofmandrel I 10 to frst chamber 120. In a closed position, a rupture disk
    135 may belocated in passageway 130, thereby blocking a flow of fluid fiom the
   throughbore 140 of valve 100 into first chamber 120. As explained above, rupture disk 1315
   nmay be fbaed of a material that is designed to rupture, or break, at a specified pressure.
             For example, in one embodiment, rupture disk 135 may be designed to break at
30 approximately 3000 PSL In other embodiments, rupture disk 135 may be designed to break
   at lower or higher pressures, such as, for example 1000 PSl.$000 PSI, 1000 PSI, or 15000
   PSL The pressure at which rupture disk 135 ruptures may vary depending on specific valve
    100 design anti operational requirements in a manner that will be readily ascertainable by
   those skilled in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. For example, the pressure rating
35 of rupture disk 135 may vary as a result of the depth of the well, properties of the fluid being
   pumped downhole, size of valve 100, etc.
                                                    5

             In certain embodiients, multiple rupture disks 135 may be located around the inner
   diameter of mandrel 110, For example, two rupture disks 135 may be disposed at
   approximately IS80Pfrom one another. Those of odinary skill inthe art will appreciate that
   during casing of horizontal wells, because one side of the tool is relatively lower, cement
 5 may tend to settle on the lower side (f the tool. To prevent settled cement fiom delaying or
   preventing the actuation of valve 100, multiple rupture disks 135 may be included in valve
    100. In the event one ofrupture disks 135 on a low side of valve 100 is covered with cement
   and cannot rupture, a second, redundant rupture disk 135, may be located on a high side of
   the tool. Because cement has notcovered the rupture disk 135 on the high side of valve 100,
10 the rupture disk 135 on the high side will rupture upon valve actuation, thereby allowing
   valve 100 to open in a manner that will be readily ascertainable by those skilled in the art
   having the benefit ofthis disclosure, in certain valves 100, more than two rupture disks 135
   may be include& For example, three, ftnr, five, or more rupture disks 135 may be included
   to provide additional levels of redundancy.
15           Valve 100 also includes a ball seat 145 disposed in throughbore 140. In this
   enbodiment, ball seat 145 is coupled to the inner diameter of mandrel i10 and is located
   axially below housing and mandrel openings II I and 112. Ball seat 145 is configured to
   receive a ball (not shown), which may be dropped from the surface in order to actuate valve
    100. i will be readily ascertainable to those of ordinary skill in the art that the size opening
20  150 through ball seat 145 may vary in order to receive a certain diameter ball, For example,
   ball diameter may size may vary in 1/16th inch increments in operations in which multiple
   valves 100 are used. Inorde to allow multiple valves 100 to be actuated along the length of
   a well, ball seats 145 that correspond to the smallest diameter ballIs may be disposed at a
   farthest distal location in the well, relative to the surface, while ball seats 145 that correspond
25 to the largest diameter balls may be disposed at a location proximate the surface. Thus,
   sequentially larger balls may be dropped, thereby allowing multiple valves 100 to be opened
             Referring now to FIG. 11, a cross-sectional view of a valve in an open position
   according to embodiments of the present disclosure is shown.. The components of valve 100
   correspond to those shown in FIG. 10, as described above. In an open position., sliding
30 sleeve 11 5 is located axially below housing 105 and mandrel 110, thereby allowing fluid
   cornumication between throughbore 140 and the annulus of the casing (notsh).
             In order to actuate valve 100 into an open position. a ball 150 is dropped from the
   surface of the well. The ball 150 is pumped downhole until it contacts and seats against ball
   seat 145, as shown. Ash    fluid continues to build in. throughbore 140, the pressure increases
35 until a selected pressure is reached that causes rupture disk 135 to rupture. As rupture disk
    135 ruptures, fluid flows through passageway 130 into first chamber 120. The fluid pressure
                                                      6

   in the tubing forces siding sleeve 115 to traverse axially downward into second chamber
    125, Sliding sleeve 115 may then be locked into place through engagement of corresponding
   teeth 160 on a lock ring 155 and mandrel 105. The lock ring 55may then permanently
   secure sliding sleeve I15 in an open position, thereby allowing full fluid flow through
 $ housing and mandrel openings 11 and 112.
              Referring to FlG. 12, a flow chart of a method for actuating a valve according to
   embodiments of the present disclosure is shown. The flow chart is provided to further
   illustrate and clarify actuation of the valve discussed above. During completion of a well,
   prior to production, the well is cased by pumping cement into the well. Cement is pumped
10 downhole through a throughbore of the valve. The cement exits a easing string (not shown)
   into an annular section of the well formed between the casing string and the formation. After
   the cementing operation is complete, a wiping device (not shown), such as a wiper plug, is
   typically run through the casing string. The wiper plug is forced downward with a flow of
   fluid and is designed to remove residual cement from the inner diameter of the casing string,
15 including along the innerdiameter of the valve, discussed above.
              The casing string may include a number of tools, such as packers, which may be
   used to isolate sections of the well. As it is common for a well to include numerous
   production zones, particular production zones may be isolated by disposing one or more
   packers below and/or above the production zone. Along the casing string between the
20 packers one or more valves may be disposed, thereby allowing fluid, such as a facing fluid
   to be pumped downhole to fracture the formation,
              In order to actuate a valve and allow facing fluid to fracture formation, flud is
   initially flowed (at 200) through the valve, In this embodiment, the valve has a housing
   having an opening, a mandrel having an opening and a passageway, a sliding sleeve disposed
25 between the housing and the mandrei, and a ballseat disposed in the mandrel. To actuate the
    valve, a ball is dropped (at 205) from the surface and pumped downhole. Once in the valve,
   the ball seats (at 210) into the ball seat, thereby blocking the flow of fluid through the
   mandrel. Because the flow of fluid is blocked, a pressure differental is created above and
    below the seated ball. Pressure increases above the seated ball until a selected pressure is
30  reached, at which point a rupture disk ruptures, and fluid flows through a passageway
    connecting the throughbore of the valve with a first chamber.
              Fluid flows (at 215) through the passageway into the first chamber and into contact
    with the sliding sleeve. The sliding sleeve moves (at 220) axially downward between the
    housing and the mandrel into a second chamber. As the sliding sleeve moves (at 220)
35  downward, fluid communication is allowed between the throughbore of the valve and the
                                                     7

     casing and/or formation of the well. More specifically, fluid exits (at 225) the valve through
     the openings in the housingand mandrel
               In certain embodiments, the sliding sleeve may lock into an open position through
     engagement of ratcheting teeth of a lock ring of the sliding sleeve and corresponding
  5  ratcheting teeth ofthe mandrel. In alternative embodiments, sliding seeve may not be
     locked into place. In such an embodinent, the fluid pressure May hold the sliding sleeve in
     an open position.
               Referring to iK. 13, a cross-sectional view of a valve in a closed position
     according to embodiments of the present disclosure is shown. Valve 300 is shown coupled to
10   an upper tool assembly 306 and a lower tool assembly 307. As explained above, upper tool
     assembly 306 and lower tool assembly 307 may include any number of tools used in
    downhole operations including, for example, packers, sub-assemblies, flow control
    equipment, etc       Valve 300, upper tol assembly 306, and lower tool assembly 307 are
    coupled through threadable connections 308, In this embodinent, valve 300 includes a
15   housing 305 and a mandrel 310.
               llousing 305 has one or more openings 311 lcated at various locations around
    valve 300, Inaddition to openings 311 in. housing 305, valve 300 also includes one or more
    corresponding mandrel openings 3.12. Mandrel 310 openings 3.12 correspond in location to
    housing 305 openings 311, and as such, the geometry and size of mandrel 31.0 openings 312
20  may vary as housing 305 openings 311 vary
               A sliding sleeve 315 is disposed between housing 305 and mandrel 310. In this
    embodiment, a first chamber 320- is formed between housing 305 and mandrel 310, and-is
    located axially above sliding sleeve 315. Similarly, a second chamber 325 is formed
    between housing 305 and mandrel 31(0, and is located below sliding sleeve 315. First and
25  second chambers 320 and 325 are at atmospheric pressure when sliding sleeve 31$ is in a
    closed position. Because the pressure in first and second chambers 320 and 325 is balanced,
    te, both chambersare at-atmospheric pressure, the sliding sleeve does not move axially
    within the chambers 320 and 325, and thus valve 300 remains in a closed position.
               A passageway 330 is located axially above sliding sleeve 315 and fluidly connects
30  the inner diameter of mandrel 310 to first chamber 320. Valve 300 also includes a ball seat
    345: disposed in thoughbore340, Ball seat 345 is located above openings 311 and 312 and
      s positioned to prevent fluid communication between throughbore 340 and frst chamber
    320. Ball seat 345 is connected to mandrel 310 through one or more shear pins 365.
    Additionally, one or more seals 370 may be disposed between ball seat 345 and mandrel 310
35  above and below passageway 330, thereby effectively isolating passageway 330 from
                                                    8

   throughbore 340. Because passageway 330 is isolated ftom throughbore 340, balanced
   pressure in first and second chambers 320 aid 325 may be maintained.
               Rerring now to FIG. 14.,Aross-sectonal view of the valve of FIG. 13 in an open
   position according to embodinients of the present disclosure is shown. The components of
 5  valve 300 correspond to those shown in FIG. 13, as described above. In an open position,
   sliding sleeve 315 is located axially below housing and mandrel openings 311 and 312,
   thereby allowing fluid communication between throughbore 340 and the casing (not shown).
              In order to actuate valve 300 into an open position, a ball 350 is dropped from the
   surface of the well. The ball 350 is pumped downhole until it contacts and seats against ball
10 seat 345. As fluid continuesto be pumped into throughbore 340, pressure increases until a
   selected pressure isreached that cause shear pins 360 to break. The breaking of shear pins
   360 causes ball seat 345 to move axially within throughbore 340 into a final open position.
   As ball seat 345 moves, fluid flows through passageway 330 into first chamber 320. The
   fluid pressure in the tubing forces sliding sleeve 315 to traverse axially downward into
IS second chamber 325. Sliding sleeve 315 may then be locked into place through engagement
   of corresponding teeth 360 on lock ring 355 and mandrel 305. The lock ring 355 may then
   permanently secure sliding sleeve 315 into an open position, thereby allowing full fluid flow
   through housing and mandrel:penings 311 and 312.
              in certain embodients, a rupture disk (not shown) may be disposed in passageway
20 330. In such an embodiment, the rupture disk may serve as an additional check to prevent
   premure actuation ofvalve 300. Thus even if bal seat 345 moved prematurely, valve 300
   would not open until the selected increased pressure was reached.
              Referring to FIG. 15, aflow chart of a method for actuating a valve of FIGS. 13 and
    14 according to embodiments of the present disclosure is shown. The flow chart is provided
25 to further clarify actuation of the valve discussed above.
              In order to actuate a valve and allowing facing fluid to fracture formation, fluid is
   initially flowed 400 through the valve, in this embodiment, the valve has a housing having
   an opening, a mandrel having an opening and a passageway, asliding sleeve disposed
   between the housing and the mandrel, and a ball seat disposed inthe mandrel To actuate the
30 valve, a ball is dropped.(at 405) from the surface and pumped downhole; Once in the valve,
   the ball seats (at 410) into the ball seat, thereby blocking the flow offluid through the
   mandrelt Because the flow of fluid is blocked, a pressure is applied to the ball seat, breaking
   shear pins holding the ball seat in place, and causing the ball seat to move (at 415) axially
   downward.
35            Fluid flows (at 420) through the passageway into a flrs chamber and into contact
   with the sliding sleeve, The sliding sleeve moves (at 425) axially downward between the
                                                     9

   housing and the mandrel into a second chamber. As the sliding sleeve moves (ai 425)
   downward, fluid corn.munication is allowed between the throughhore of the valve and the
    asinig and/or formation of the we 1.
            Advantageously, embodiments of the present disclosure may provide for valves
 5 used in hydraudic fracturing operations that open fiil ly, thereby allowing for more effective
   facing operations. Also advantageously, einbodiments of the presstt disclosure may
   provide valves with redundant systems to prevent premature actuation of the downhole
   valve.
            While the prescat disclosure has been described with respect to alimited number      of
10 embodiments, those skilled in the art, having benefof this disclosure, will appreciate that
   other embodiments may be devised which do not depart froim the scope of the disclosure as
   described herein Accordingly, the scope of the disclosure should be limited only by the
   attached claims.
