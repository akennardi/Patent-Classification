          Legumain activated Doxorubicin derivative as well as preparation method and
   application thereof
         This application is a divisional of Australian patent application 2015275248, filed
 5 26 December 2013, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.
          Technical Field
          The present invention relates to an anti-tumor compound. Specifically, the present
   invention relates to a doxorubicin derivative for targeted activation by legumain, with a long
10 metabolic half-life in vivo, and its preparation method and use.
          Technical Background
          Doxorubicin (DOX) hydrochloride and epirubicin are commercially available anti-tumor
   antibiotics with a broad anti-tumor spectrum, killing many kinds of tumor cells, and the
15 mechanism underlying is mainly the inhibition on the synthesis of nucleic acids upon the
   doxorubicin molecule inserting into DNA. Doxorubicin hydrochloride and epirubicin can be
   used to treat hematological tumors and solid tumors, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer,
   sarcoma, and many other solid tumors. However, the dose of this kind of anthracycline
   compounds is restricted in clinical use because they bring serious toxicity or side effect.
20 Doxorubicin hydrochloride can cause various unwanted effects, including bone marrow toxicity,
   gastrointestinal diseases, stomatitis, alopecia, exosmosis, acute and cumulative cardiac toxicity.
   A main limitation of doxorubicin hydrochloride lies in that, after each course of treatment, a
   great dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride leads to sharp reduction of monocytes and platelets in
   bone marrow and blood. A major concern is that a cumulative cardiac toxicity may induce a
25 myocardial congestive heart failure, which is irreversible.
          Doxorubicin (DOX) and epirubicin were functionally modified to produce effective
   doxorubicin based anti-tumor drugs having lower side effect.
          Inventors of the subject application reported the structures and biological effects of
   Legubicin (BOC-AANL-DOX) and LEG3 (Succinyl-AANL-DOX) in CancerResearch in
30 2003 and 2006. However, further investigation on the drugs showed that each of both
   compounds is only provided with a single-targeting ability. And they had a short metabolic
   half-life, which leads to insufficient concentration and duration necessary for drug activation at
   the tumor site, and in turn, low efficacy in an animal model. Thus, they are not ideal anti-tumor
   drugs.

         Therefore, targeting doxorubicin- and/or epirubicin-based drugs with reduced toxicity of
   doxorubicin hydrochloride and epirubicin and high efficacy as anti-tumor agents are in special
   need.
 5       Disclosure of the Invention
         The present invention intends to provide a targeting doxorubicin derivative for targeted
   activation by legumain, which exhibits a long metabolic half-life in vivo. The derivative only
   targets to and is only activated at the tumor site. Thus, it has greatly reduced toxicity and greatly
   increased efficacy.
10       To achieve the purpose, the present invention provides a doxorubicin derivative for
   targeted activation by legumain, which exhibits a long metabolic half-life in vivo and has the
   following structural formula:

         The present invention also provides use of the above doxorubicin derivative for targeted
   activation by Legumain in the preparation of an anti-tumor drug.
         To reduce toxicity brought by an anti-tumor drug on normal cells and tissues of human
                                                      4

   body, great efforts have been made to enhance the biological specificity and selectivity of
   anti-tumor drugs. Recently, with development in tumor molecular biology and other basic
   sciences, great improvement in research and development of drugs for targeted treatment of
   tumors has been made. The molecular targets for the above doxorubicin derivative for targeted
 5 activation by Legumain are cathepsin (Cathepsin) and Legumain (Legumain) that generally
   expressed in malignant tumor cells. Both cathepsin and Legumain are proteolytic enzymes
   highly expressed at the tumor site. They present in most of the solid tumors and tumor
   microenvironment, and also distributed in a great amount in immune infiltrating macrophages
   and endothelial cells of the new blood vessels. Overexpression of such enzymes is highly
10 associated with invasion of the tumor cells to the normal histiocytes, tumor metastasis and
   apoptosis of tumor cells.
          Because of the increased permeability of blood vessels along with the growth of the tumor,
   high expression of the Legumain, Legumain, within the tumor microenvironment, and low pH
   in the local acidic microenvironment on the surface of the tumor, the modified polypeptide
15 doxorubicin hydrochloride which is tumor microenvironment-targeting and activated, as a
   specific substrate of Legumain, will be effectively hydrolyzed and activated only in the tumor
   microenvironment, thereby releasing its cytotoxicity. Although there are also a small amount of
   Legumains expressed in other normal cells of a human body, this enzyme is not active in the
   microenvironment on the surface of normal cells. Thus, the polypeptide doxorubicin
20 hydrochloride for targeted activation could not be hydrolyzed and activated on the surface of
   normal cells, and in turn causes no cytotoxicity to normal cells. Consequently, the targeted
   activation produces cytotoxicity only to tumor cells.
          Additionally, since the drug can be completely released after the peptide chain is
   hydrolyzed by Legumain, we can conjugate a targeted group that can improve the efficacy of
25 the drug to the other end of the peptide chain. After screening by experiments, the drug release
   and activation will not be affected and the retention of the drug at the tumor site and its
   anti-tumor efficiency can be improved when R( is preferably 6-maleimidocaproic (S
   maleimidocaproic, EMC) or trans-butanedioic acid monoester (EFA).
          R6 includes             0  , wherein n=1-20; or                 0   , wherein R 7 is
30 substituted or unsubstituted, linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated C1-C20 fatty
   hydrocarbon, or substituted or unsubstituted C6-C20 aromatic hydrocarbon. Preferably, R 6 is
   6-maleimidocaproic (s- maleimidocaproic, EMC) or trans-butanedioic acid monoester (EFA).
   Therefore, as compared with doxorubicin, the doxorubicin derivative for targeted activation by
                                                    5

   Legumain synthesized in the present invention exhibits both tumor-specific targeting and
   tumor-specific activation, and a highly efficient and safe anti-tumor effect.
          In summary, the present invention provides a targeted doxorubicin derivative for targeted
   activation by Legumain, having a long metabolic half-life in vivo, wherein Legumain can
 5 cleave the peptide by hydrolysis at the position before Asn of the drug to release compound
   A-Leu or compound A. As a result, the doxorubicin of the present invention is tumor-targeted
   and has a long half-life. As compared with doxorubicin and epirubicin, the derivative of the
   present invention has a greatly improved efficacy and a greatly reduced toxicity and is thus
   provided with a promising application prospect.

          Results and discussion: no pilo-erection, hair tousle and lackluster, lethargy, stoop,
   irritable reaction and death were observed in mice receiving 150 mg/kg SI and S2 injection. As
   shown in Table 1, the MTD of the SI and S2 injections were far beyond 100 Vtmol/kg, and were
   significantly higher than the MTD of doxorubicin hydrochloride (4 - 8 pmol/kg). The MTD for

          According to Table 4, the doxorubicin derivatives prepared from condensation of the

   substituted or unsubstituted, linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated C1-C20 fatty
10 hydrocarbon, or substituted or unsubstituted C6-C20 aromatic hydrocarbon.
          The polypeptide doxorubicin of the present invention was functionally modified for tumor
   targeting by R6 , which is preferably EMC or EFA and will be exemplified by EMC below. This
   modification allows the drug to have the following advantages.
15        1. Having the ability of targeting tumor
          The R 6 group allows the drug to be able to target cathepsin (Cathepsin B) in the tumor
   microenvironment and inhibit the activity of cathepsin necessary for tumor growth,
   development and metastasis. On the contrary, Succinyl-AANL-DOX does not exhibit this
   targeted function. The R 6 group also allows the drug to have an additional function of targeting
20 tumor, thus the drug has two targeted effects. In the in vitro binding assay, EMC-AANL-DOX
   can efficiently bind to Cathepsin B.
          The test method was described as follows. Cathepsin was absorbed on a 96-well plate and
   blocked with BSA. Succinyl-AANL-DOX, SI and a mixture of SI and E-64 (an inhibitor for
   specific binding of cathepsin) were added to allow them to bind to the cathepsin on the 96-well
25 plate. The unbound drugs were removed and the fluorescence of the bound drug was detected.
   The results showed that Succinyl-AANL-DOX did not bind to absorbed cathepsin while S 1
   bound to the cathepsin. The competitive inhibitory assay indicated that the Sl 's binding site on
                                                    20

   the cathepsin was close to the E-64's binding site on the cathepsin, and binding of E-64 could
   competitively inhibit the binding of S 1, as shown in Figure 1.
          Furthermore, Z-Phe-Arg-NMec was used as substrate to analyze the activity of cathepsin
   under pH 6.0. Results showed that the substrate could be activated by the cathepsin (Cathepsin
 5 B) over the time, and the fluorescent intensity was improved. Addition of S I could effectively
   inhibit the enzymatic activity of cathepsin, as shown in Figure 2. Cathepsin B was highly
   expressed in the lysosome of the tumor cell. It could degrade type I collagen, activate interstitial
   procollagenase and type IV procollagenase, and degrade type I, II, 111 and IV collagen fibers in
   the stroma, thus anticipating infiltration and metastasis of tumor. Inhibiting the enzymatic
10 activity of cathepsin could improve inhibition of infiltration and metastasis of tumor, and
   inhibiting cathepsin could also inhibit bone metastasis of tumor (such as breast cancer).
          2. Improving retention of drug at the tumor site
          After intravenous injection of EMC-AANL-DOX, EMC-AANL-DOX could accumulate
15 at the tumor site due to the targeting property of the EMC group, as compared with
   Succinyl-AANL-DOX and more EMC-AANL-DOX were distributed in the tumor tissue. Since
   the drug itself could produce fluorescence, we detected distribution of Succinyl-AANL-DOX
   and EMC-AANL-DOX in the tumor tissue sections by fluorescence microscope 12 hours after
   intravenous injection of 10ipmol/kg Succinyl-AANL-DOX and EMC-AANL-DOX. The nuclear
20 was stained by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). As shown in Figure 3, significantly more
   EMC-AANL-DOX were distributed in the tumor tissue, indicating that EMC-AANL-DOX
   improved retention of drug in the tumor site. Figure 4 shows the distribution of D1, Dox and
   Succinyl-AANL-DOX in the tumor and heart tissues. As shown in Figure 4, EMC-AANL-DOX
   accumulated in a higher concentration in the tumor tissue as compared with doxorubicin and
25 Succinyl-AANL-DOX, with no accumulation in the heart tissue. These results demonstrated
   that EMC-AANL-DOX could improve the targeting to the tumor and avoid heart toxicity
   caused by accumulation of Dox in the heart.
          3. Improving the efficacy
30        The efficacy of Succinyl-AANL-DOX and EMC-AANL-DOX in BALB/C mice were
   studied and compared.
          Test purpose: to investigate the anti-tumor efficacy of Succinyl-AANL-DOX and
   EMC-AANL-DOX in a 4T1 breast cancer treatment model from BALB/C mice.
          Treatment drug: Succinyl-AANL-DOX and EMC-AANL-DOX injections, and
35 doxorubicin hydrochloride injection, diluted to corresponding concentrations by physiological
                                                    21

   saline when testing.
          1. Animal: BALB/C mice of 6-8 weeks old, all female.
          2. Production of tumor model
          1) 4T1 cells were purchased from American type culture collection (ATCC) and identified
 5 according the specification provided by ATCC. Cells were cultivated in dulbecco's modified
   eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37'C and 5% CO2. The cells
   were passaged for every three days and cells within the 15t* passage were used.
          2) Production of tumor. 106 4T1 cells were subcutaneously injected to the back of the
   BALB/C mice. Mice were randomly grouped after the diameter of the tumor reached about 0.3
10 cm to 0.4 cm. Then treatment began.
          3) Course of treatment
          Succinyl-AANL-DOX, Legubicin and EMC-AANL-DOX were intraperitoneally injected.
   The dose of Succinyl-AANL-DOX, Legubicin and EMC-AANL-DOX were all 28.16 ptmol/kg.
   The dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride was 3.448 ptmol/kg. The control group was
15 administered with physiological saline. The drugs were administered twice weekly for three
   weeks.
          4) Results and discussion. Figure 5 showed the curve indicating inhibitory effect on tumor
   growth in the 4T I breast cancer model by S 1, Dox, Succinyl-AANL-DOX, Legubicin and
   solvent control (Vehicle). As shown in Figure 5, EMC-AANL-DOX could significantly
20 improve the inhibitory effect on tumor growth in the BALB/C mice after intraperitoneal inject,
   as compared with Succinyl-AANL-DOX, Dox, and BOC-AANL-DOX.
          In some examples and many other tumor treatment modes of the present invention,
   efficacies of Succinyl-AANL-DOX and EMC-AANL-DOX were also studied and compared
   according to the same method as described above. It was found that the inhibitory effect of
25 EMC-AANL-DOX on tumor growth was greatly improved in the 4T1 breast cancer model, etc.,
   which was about 4 - 5 folds of Succinyl-AANL-DOX. And, in efficacy assays using different
   doses, it was found that only EMC-AANL-DOX could completely kill the tumor, with no
   recurrence of tumor in the later stage of the treatment, as shown by the human non-small cell
   lung cancer A549 model in Figure 6. Thus, EMC-AANL-DOX could satisfy our requirements
30 on clinical development.
          4. Changing in drug metabolism and greatly improving metabolic half-life of the drug
          The R6 group changed the metabolic state of the drug, such as Si. After intravenous
   injection, Succinyl-AANL-DOX did not bind to serum albumin in the blood plasma and was
35 metabolized in the blood as free small molecule. However, after entering into blood, SI could
                                                     22

   bind to the serum albumin. SI and Succinyl-AANL-DOX were intravenously injected at the tail.
   Bloods were taken after 10 minutes and centrifuged to obtain serum. The proteins in the serum
   were precipitated by 70% ethanol. The results showed that after entering into the blood, most of
   SI could bind to serum albumin and thus precipitated. On the contrary, Succinyl-AANL-DOX
 5 was still present in the supernate. These results demonstrated that doxorubicin drug, such as Si,
   modified by R6 , was a drug having a completely different metabolism.
         In some examples of the present invention, it was also found that, after entering into the
   blood, most of SI bound to the plasma protein and the metabolic half-life of SI in the mice
   blood was increased to above 74 hours, as compared with 42 minutes for BOC-AANL-DOX
10 and 37 hours for Succinyl-AANL-DOX.
         In summary, the present invention synthesizes derivatives of doxorubicin hydrochloride,
   which could be activated by Legumain and target to cathepsin and were demonstrated by
   toxicity and efficacy assays to provide lower toxicity, more significant anti-tumor activity and
   inhibition of tumor metastasis than doxorubicin hydrochloride and Succinyl-AANL-DOX.
