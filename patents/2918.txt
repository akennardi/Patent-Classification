Description
METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR POSITIONING A TRUCK FOR LOADING
Technical Field
[0001]     The present disclosure relates generally to truck loading and, more particularly, to a
method and system for positioning a truck for loading.
Background
[0002]     Haulage machines, e.g., trucks, are used in connection with work sites, such as
excavations, surface mines, and construction projects, to receive loads from a loading machine,
such as an excavating or mining machine, and then transport those loads to another location. For
example, one or more machines such as hydraulic excavators (HEX), wheeled or tracked loaders,
electric rope shovels (ERS), etc., may be employed at a work site to excavate or remove material.
A plurality of trucks, for example a fleet of trucks, may be used to transport the material away
from the area being mined or excavated. Trucks may move to the area, for example along one or
more haul roads, and they may queue up and sequentially move into position to receive a load
from the excavating or mining machine.
[0003]     Often the loading machine that is excavating or removing material may remain at the
same location, or substantially so, while nominally repositioning itself to load a truck that has
moved into position to receive a load from the machine. The excavation may develop somewhat
gradually while trucks move to the work site, sequentially receive loads from the loading
machine, and move away from the work site to transport the load. Optimally, one truck should
be ready to move into position to receive a load as soon as another truck has moved away with
its load and the machine is ready to deposit another load. At times, particularly at a large
excavation site or mining operation, multiple machines may be operating to remove material
while a substantial fleet of trucks operates to receive material from them and haul it away.

                                                  2
[0004]     When locating or spotting a truck near a loading machine, the most common way for a
loading machine operator to signal a truck operator when to reverse into position to receive a
load of material is referred to as a "hanging bucket." The truck operator uses the hanging bucket
as a guide to maneuver the truck to the correct position. The truck operator must take great care
to move the truck to the correct position and orientation so that the loading machine operator can
efficiently load the truck and position the material in the bed correctly.
[0005]     Careful movement to the correct position also is desirable in order to avoid spillage and
to avoid accidents such as collision with the bucket or another part of the excavator and/or with
another truck that may be maneuvering to receive a load. Many of the haulage machines (i.e.,
trucks) employed at large mining/excavating sites are very large and difficult to maneuver,
particularly when moving in reverse to a precise location. While an ERS can move the shovel
forward or aft of the truck to some degree if the truck is not precisely positioned, precision is
more necessary with a HEX since movement of the boom, stick, and bucket are more limited.
Where the loading machine operator cannot load efficiently or position the material in the bed
properly, the loading machine may request that the truck operator reposition the truck.
Repositioning a truck in a mining operation is undesirable since it wastes time.
[0006]     Where a truck operator requires multiple attempts to properly locate the truck at the
optimum loading spot location, both time and fuel may be wasted during a renewed effort to
maneuver to the correct location. Repositioning the excavator relative to the truck is generally a
much slower, more impractical, and more dangerous procedure. It would be both beneficial and
desirable to improve efficiency in the process of loading trucks at work sites such as mines and
excavations, for example. There is a need for improvement in the process of spotting or
positioning trucks for loading and ensuring that sequential loading of multiple trucks occurs with
optimum fuel and time efficiency and with minimal risk of accidents.
[0007]     One truck loading system is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 8,862,390 issued to
Sugawara, et al. on October 14, 2014 ("the '390 patent"). The '390 patent discloses a system
employing GPS whereby a target position image and an approach route leading to a loading
position adjacent an excavator are displayed on a dump truck display when the truck approaches
the loading position. A current position image advances along the approach route to the target

                                                  3
position image, and the truck is moved into the loading image target position. The '390 patent
discloses that the excavator sends a request for movement to the loading position to all dump
trucks, but priority is given to the one dump truck closest to the excavator, or to the dump truck
with a driver having a high level of skill.
[0008]     The truck loading system of the '390 patent may enhance loading operations at a work
site to some extent, but there remains room for improving loading and material transporting
efficiency. While the '390 patent discloses giving priority to either the dump truck closest to the
excavator, or to the dump truck with a highly skilled driver, this may not be enough to ensure
optimum efficiency. Where multiple loading positions are possible, for example plural
excavators that are closely situated or excavators positioned to load from either side of the
excavator, simply choosing the truck closest or with a better driver does not consider the
orientation of the truck. For example, given size and maneuverability, a closest truck may not be
positioned and ready to quickly move into loading position. In addition, giving priority to the
driver presumed to have a high level of skill may not adequately reduce risk of accidents.
[0009]     The disclosed method and system for positioning a truck for loading is directed to
overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above.
Summary
[0010]     According to one exemplary aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method for
positioning a truck for loading by a loading machine. The method may include setting a loading
spot location by the loading machine via a truck spotting system The method also may include
broadcasting the loading spot location to trucks within a broadcast range. The method also may
include displaying the loading spot location only to a truck that is in reverse gear.
[0011]     According to another exemplary aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method
for positioning a truck for loading by one of a plurality of loading machine working in close
proximity. The method may include setting loading spot locations by both a first and a second
loading machine of the plurality of loading machines via a truck spotting system. The method
also may include broadcasting by both the first and the second loading machines the loading spot

                                                    4
locations to trucks within a broadcast range of both the first and the second loading machines.
The method also may include displaying one of the loading spot locations only to a truck that is
in reverse gear.
[0012]     According to yet another exemplary aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a
system for determining the loading spot location for a haulage machine and including at least one
loading machine and a plurality of haulage machines. The system may include at least one
loading machine configured to be capable of depositing a load at multiple loading spot locations
and configured to broadcast signals indicative of at least two loading spot locations. The system
also may include a plurality of haulage machines. Each haulage machine may be configured to
receive the signals indicative of the at least two loading spot locations when within a broadcast
range of the signals. The haulage machine also may be configured to measure the distance to the
at least two loading spot locations. The haulage machines also may be configured to determine
the closest of the at least two loading spot locations. The system may be configured to provide
directions to the closest loading spot location only to a haulage machine that is in a reverse gear.

Detailed Description
[0013]     Fig. 1 illustrates a worksite 10. Worksite 10 may be any of various types of worksites
where material is being removed and transported away from the immediate area where it is being
removed. For example, worksite 10 may be a surface mining operation, a quarrying operation, a
construction site, or any other endeavor where material is removed and transported. Worksite 10
may include a loading machine 12 capable of excavating or otherwise removing material from a

                                                    5
surface, for example the surface on which loading machine 12 is supported or a face of an
excavation, and then depositing a load of that material. Typically, loading machine 12 may be
an electric rope shovel (ERS) or a hydraulic excavator (HEX). Loading machine 12 also may be
a wheel-type loader, a tracked loader, a backhoe, or any other machine capable of removing
material and then depositing a load of the removed material.
[0014]      Loading machine 12 may include a superstructure 14 supported by ground supports
16, for example endless tracks. Superstructure 14 may support a linkage system 18 which may
in turn support a tool 20, such as a bucket or shovel, capable of removing material, containing
the removed material, and then depositing or dumping the removed material. Loading machine
12 may be capable of depositing a load of material at locations on opposite sides of loading
machine 12. As viewed in Fig. 1, one side of loading machine 12 is designated left side 22, and
the opposite side of loading machine 12 is designated right side 24. Loading machine 12 may be
capable of movement so as to reorient tool 20 from its load gathering position to positions for
depositing a load at the left side 22 or at the right side 24 of loading machine 12. Reorientation
of tool 20 may be by way of superstructure 14 being capable of swinging or pivoting relative to
ground supports 16, for example.
[0015]     Typically, one or more haulage machines, for example trucks 26, may be employed at
worksite 10 for receiving material excavated or removed by loading machine 12 and transporting
the material to another location. For example, in a surface mining or quarrying operation, trucks
26 may transport loads received from loading machine 12 to one or more crushers. Loads also
may be transported to another location, for example a nearby or remote dumpsite. The number
of trucks 26 that may be employed at worksite 10 may vary substantially, depending on the size
of the operation. For example, in a large operation, a fleet of trucks 26 may be required to
transport the removed material.
[0016]     During operation at worksite 10, some trucks will be in the process of transporting a
load that has been received, while other trucks will be returning to worksite 10 and queueing up
to maneuver into position to receive a load from loading machine 12. As a truck 26 approaches
the general location of loading machine 12, for example along one or more haul roads such as
haul road 28, truck 26 may not yet know the precise location at which a load will be deposited by

                                                    6
loading machine 12. For example, loading machine 12 may deposit a load at a loading spot
location 30 at left side 22, or at loading spot location 32 at right side 24.
[0017]     Currently, as truck 26 moves to a cusp location 34, a cusp location 36, or a cusp
location 38, for example, in anticipation of shifting to reverse and backing to a loading spot
location 30 or 32 to receive a load, the truck operator may then know which side of loading
machine 12 he or she may need to be on. This may have been communicated to the truck
operator via the "hanging bucket" technique or by direct communication between the truck
operator and the loading machine operator. Where there is no communication indicating the side
of loading machine 12 for truck 26 to be on, the truck operator may simply make a guess which
side to position on.
[0018]     The disclosed truck spotting system may more reliably inform the truck operator which
side of a loading machine 12 to position truck 26 on and the correct orientation for the truck 26
relative to loading machine 12. This may eliminate the need for the hanging bucket technique or
other conventional communication. The disclosed truck spotting system will assign and display
the closest spot point and project the path to that spot point. Ordinarily, the truck operator should
be able to perceive the closest spot point, but the truck spotting system will make sure the correct
spot point is assigned and displayed with a reverse path, based on the measured distance to it, if
there are multiple broadcast spot points. Loading machine 12, in accordance with disclosed
embodiments to be further described subsequently, may broadcast information regarding
potential loading spot locations via any conventional broadcasting technology within a broadcast
range 44, and trucks 26 within broadcast range 44 may receive that information.
[0019]     While Fig. 1 illustrates a worksite 10 involving a single loading machine 12 capable of
depositing a load at multiple locations, Fig. 2 illustrates a worksite 50 and an operation where a
plurality of loading machines 52 and 54 work in close proximity. Like loading machine 12,
loading machines 52 and 54 may be any type of machine capable of excavating or otherwise
removing material and then depositing a load of that material (e.g., a hydraulic excavator, an
ERS, etc.). Each loading machine 52, 54 may be capable of depositing a load at plural locations,
such as loading spot locations 56, 58, and 60, for example. While three loading spot locations
are illustrated in Fig. 2, it will be understood that it is contemplated that loading machines 52, 54

                                                   7
may be variously oriented relative to each other, and that loading machine 52, like loading
machine 54, may be capable of depositing a load on its opposite sides. In addition, scenarios are
contemplated with more than two loading machines working in close proximity and capable of
depositing a load at opposite sides of the machine.
[0020]     Trucks 62, for example a fleet of trucks, may approach work site 50 and the general
location where loading machines 52 and 54 are working in order to receive a load from one of
loading machine 52 and 54 in a manner similar to that described in connection with worksite 10
and Fig. 1. Some trucks will be in the process of transporting a load that has been received,
while other trucks will be returning to worksite 50 and queueing up to maneuver into position to
receive a load from one of loading machines 52 and 54.
[0021]     As a truck 62 moves to a cusp location 64, for example, in anticipation of shifting to
reverse and backing to a loading spot location 56, 58, or 60 to receive a load, truck 62 may not
yet know either the loading machine from which it will receive a load, or the precise location at
which a load will be deposited. For example, the distances 66, 68, and 70 may be unknown.
Loading machines 52 and 54, in accordance with disclosed embodiments to be further described
subsequently, may broadcast information regarding potential loading spot locations via any
conventional broadcasting technology within broadcast ranges 72 and 74, for example, and any
trucks 62 within broadcast ranges 72, 74 may receive that information. It should be understood
that the broadcast ranges 72, 74 in Fig. 2 are illustrative only, and that actual broadcast ranges
may vary and overlap substantially. It is contemplated that loading machine 52, 54, working in
close proximity may have broadcast ranges that overlap considerable more than that
schematically shown in Fig. 2 so that trucks 62 approaching the vicinity of the loading machine
will be capable of receiving information from both machines.
[0022]     Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic illustration of features of a truck spotting system 100. In Fig.
3, a single loading machine 102 and a truck 104 to be loaded are schematically illustrated, but it
will be understood that truck spotting system 100 is applicable to scenarios involving one
loading machine (see, e.g., Fig. 1) or multiple loading machines (see, e.g., Fig. 2). It is
contemplated that a fleet of trucks 104 may sequentially arrive at a worksite to receive a load, for
example along one or more haul roads. Loading machine 102 may include a controller 106, for

                                                   8
example a microprocessor capable of running one or more applications, storing data, and
retrieving data. In addition to being capable of controlling various loading machine systems,
controller 106 may be configured to perform functions of the disclosed truck spotting system
100. Truck 104 may include a controller 108, for example a microprocessor similar to that
described for loading machine 102. Controller 108 may be configured to perform functions of
the disclosed truck spotting system 100, and also may be capable of controlling various systems
of truck 104.
[0023]     Loading machine 102 may retrieve a load of material in the normal course of operation
and make a decision, e.g. via the loading machine operator and controller 106, to deposit the load
at a loading spot location, e.g., loading spot location 110. Controller 106 may, via transmitting
device 112, broadcast signals indicative of the position of the selected loading spot location 110.
The broadcast frequency may vary, but may be selected so as to broadcast the signals over a
broadcast range that may cover an area in which several trucks 104 are currently located, either
returning to the worksite for a load, maneuvering into position to receive a load, or leaving the
worksite with a load. For example only, the broadcast range may have a radius on the order of
100 meters, more or less.
[0024]     The signals indicative of the position of the selected loading spot location 110 may be
received by all trucks within the broadcast range, for example by truck 104 via receiving device
114, and processed by controller 108. Truck 104 also may include a display device 116
configured to display to an operator of truck 104 visual information including, among other
things, the loading spot location 110 indicated by signals received by receiving device 114.
However, although the signals may be received, the loading spot location 110 will not
necessarily be displayed to all trucks that receive the signals.
[0025]     In accordance with disclosed embodiments, in order for the loading spot location 110
to appear on display device 116, truck 104 must be in a reverse gear. For example, truck 104,
upon arriving at the worksite and in the general area of operation of loading machine 102, may
maneuver forward to a cusp location (see, e.g., Fig. 1) where forward motion may cease, and
engage a reverse gear in preparation for maneuvering in reverse to the loading spot location 110.

                                                   9
At this cusp location where forward truck movement has ceased and the truck has just shifted
into reverse gear, controller 108 may initiate display of the loading spot location 110.
[0026]     As disclosed in the description of Fig. 1, a loading machine may deposit a load at more
than one loading spot location. Accordingly, loading machine 102 may, e.g. via the loading
machine operator and controller 106, designate a potential loading spot location 110 at one side
of loading machine 102, and designate a second potential loading spot location at the other side
of loading machine 102 (see, e.g., Fig. 1). In such a scenario, controller 108 associated with
truck 104 may, e.g., via GPS 118 location or any other conventional distance measuring
technology, measure the distance to each potential loading spot location designated by loading
machine 102. Controller 108 may determine the closest of the two designated potential loading
spot locations. Once truck 104 then maneuvers to a cusp location and shifts into a reverse gear,
controller 108 may initiate display of the closest loading spot location on display device 116.
[0027]     Display device 116 also may display a closest path to the loading spot location.
Accordingly, an operator of truck 104 may be apprised of directions to the loading spot location
that include the closest loading spot location (e.g., loading spot location 110 in Fig. 3), and the
closest path for reverse movement of truck 104 to that loading spot location. The directions may
include a visual representation of the reverse path that truck 104 may follow until arrival at
loading spot location 110.
[0028]     It is contemplated that situations may arise whereby a truck operator may find it
undesirable to accept the loading spot location that has been displayed. Such a situation may
include where there are multiple loading machines close enough that the truck operator considers
it more prudent to receive a load at a different loading machine. Another such situation may be
where there is an issue with the displayed loading spot location such as an obstacle that the truck
operator either should or would rather avoid. Accordingly, a truck operator may, for any desired
reason, choose not to accept the displayed loading spot location, and instead, override the
displayed loading spot location and select a different loading spot location. The operator
choosing to override the displayed loading spot location may prudently notify the affected
loading machine. Truck 104 may then proceed to the selected different loading spot location
without displayed directions. Alternatively, via communication between controllers 106 and

                                                   10
108, display of the newly selected loading spot location and associated reverse path may appear
on display device 116.
[0029]     While the description of Fig. 3 has referred to an operation involving as single loading
machine 102, truck spotting system 100 may involve multiple loading machines. Where two or
more loading machines operate in close proximity, each loading machine being capable of
depositing a load at more than one loading spot location, truck spotting system 100 operates in a
manner similar to that described above in connection with the scenario where one loading
machine 102 is involved. Differences may be in the number of possible loading spot locations
and in that trucks 104 may be within the broadcast range of more than one loading machine 102.
Referring back to Fig. 2, a truck 104 may measure the distance to each loading spot location,
with the closest loading spot location and the closest path for truck 104 to move to that loading
spot location then displayed on display device 116 once truck 104 has shifting into a reverse
gear.
[0030]     It should be apparent that where multiple loading spot locations and/or multiple
loading machines are involved, plural trucks may be maneuvering into position to receive a load.
For example, trucks may arrive at the general location of the loading machine(s) via different
paths or haul roads, and more than one truck may begin to maneuver to a cusp location at about
the same time. In such a situation, display of a closest loading spot location and reverse path to
that location will be displayed to the first truck to shift into a reverse gear. A different loading
spot location and reverse path will be assigned to and displayed for the next truck to shift into a
reverse gear.
[0031]     Fig. 4 illustrates a flow chart 200 of an exemplary method according to disclosed
embodiments. At step 202, excavation and/or material removal may be proceeding at a worksite
via one or more loading machines as described in connection with Figs. 1, 2, and 3. Here, the
loading machine manipulates a tool, for example a bucket or shovel capable of holding a quantity
of material, to engage the material to be removed and fill the tool with material in preparation for
moving the tool to a loading spot location. The loading machine(s) may be equipped with a
controller and a transmitter (see, e.g., the description of Fig. 3) configured to transmit signals
indicative of one or more loading spot locations.

                                                   11
[0032]     In the meantime, at step 204, a fleet of trucks/haulage machines may be moving to the
worksite to receive a load of material and from the worksite to deliver loads to another location.
The trucks may queue up or otherwise sequentially position themselves in preparation for
movement to a loading spot location. Each truck may be equipped with a controller and a
receiver (see, e.g., the description of Fig. 3) configured to receive signals transmitted from the
loading machine(s). The controller may be configured to measure the distance to each loading
spot location and determine the loading spot location that is closest to the truck (e.g., via a
system such as GPS or any other conventional distance measuring system). The trucks also may
be equipped with suitable displays configured to display visual information representing the set
loading spot location(s).
[0033]     At step 206, the loading machine(s) may set one or more loading spot locations via the
truck spotting system. Here, a loading machine operator may, via the controller on-board the
loading machine, determine one loading spot location, for example at a left side of the loading
machine, or determine two possible loading spot locations, for example with one being on a left
side of the loading machine and another being on a right side of the loading machine. Where
there are two loading machines, each loading machine may set two or more possible loading spot
locations. It is contemplated that in some situations, more than two loading machines may be
working in close proximity with each loading machine setting one, two, or more loading spot
locations.
[0034]     At step 208, the loading machine(s) may broadcast the loading spot location(s) that
have been set to trucks that are within the broadcast range. The broadcast range may vary
depending on the broadcast frequency used (see, e.g., the broadcast range 44 of Fig. 1 and the
broadcast ranges 72, 74 of Fig. 2). All trucks within the broadcast range may receive the signals
indicative of loading spot locations transmitted from the loading machine(s). However, while a
truck within the broadcast range may receive the signals, information represented by the signals
is not initially displayed except under conditions to be subsequently described.
[0035]     At step 210, a truck within the broadcast range may be in position to prepare to move
to a loading spot location. A truck may move forward toward a cusp location at which forward
motion may cease in preparation for movement to a loading spot location. The truck controller

                                                  12
may initiate measurement of the distance to received loading spot locations and determine the
closest loading spot location.
[0036]     At step 212, the truck may shift into a reverse gear in preparation for backing into a
loading spot location. As the truck reaches the cusp location and has just shifted into reverse, the
controller on the truck may initiate display of the loading spot location that has been determined
to be closest and present a visual representation of the set loading spot location that is closest to
the truck. In addition, the display may present a visual representation of the closest path to the
selected loading spot location.
[0037]     At step 214, where the truck operator determines in a particular instance that a different
loading spot location is desirable, the truck operator may override the displayed closest loading
spot location and closest path and select a different loading spot location. Concomitantly, the
truck operator may, via communication between the truck controller and the loading machine
controller, notify the loading machine of the override and elect initiation of a display of the
newly selected loading spot location and the shortest path to that location.
[0038]     At step 216, the truck may move into position to receive a load from the loading
machine and the loading machine may load the truck which subsequently may transport the load
to a designated site. At step 218, the sequence may be repeated with the next truck that has
shifting into a reverse gear.
Industrial Applicability
[0039]     Disclosed embodiments of the system and method for positioning a truck for loading
may be applicable to any worksite where one or more loading machines operate to remove
material and load trucks with the removed material. The disclosed system and method may be
implemented with any type of loading machine (e.g., HEX, ERS, etc.) and any type of truck or
haulage machine.

                                                    13
[0040]     With the disclosed system and method, the normal need for a fleet production system
to determine assignment of loading spots to the various trucks in a queue may be avoided. With
the disclosed system and method, a truck may know its assigned loading spot location when the
truck has moved to a cusp position and shifted to a reverse gear. When the truck has shifted into
a reverse gear, a display within the truck reveals the assigned loading spot location and the
closest reverse path to that loading spot location giving more certainty for the truck operator and
less risk that there may be impacts between trucks or between a truck and a loading machine.
[0041]     On some worksites, for example on a large worksite where multiple loading machines
are operating in general proximity to one another and multiple trucks may be maneuvering to
back to one of several loading spot locations, embodiments under the present disclosure ensure
that only when a truck has maneuvered to a cusp location and shifting into a reverse gear will the
assigned loading spot location and reverse path to it be displayed. Not only will this give trucks
a clear indication of a target loading spot location and path to it, but also it may prevent
potentially catastrophic accidents involving multiple trucks and a loading machine.
[0042]     It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations
can be made to the disclosed method and system for positioning a truck for loading. Other
embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification
and practice using the disclosed method and system for positioning a truck for loading. It is
intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope
being indicated by the following claims and their equivalents.
