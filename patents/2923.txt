ABSTRACT
                 In    an      elevator         system,       so   as     to   avoid       unwanted
safety         gear     tripping,          the     kinetic     energy,       which      is    caused
by     inertia        of     the     overspeed           governor      rope    (5,     6)    to  the
lever       arm     (8),      is   dissipated           by   implementing        fluid      viscous
damping         to   dampen        the    rotary       movement      of    the   spindle       shaft
 (11)     to prevent            unwanted        safety      gear   tripping        in   the    event
when       the     upwards         movement          of    the   moving      mass      (2,    3)  is
decelerated by a machinery brake to perform a quick stop                                          of
the moving mass.                 The    fluid viscous damping is                 effected by a
viscous          fluid          damper        (13)        which    is      arranged         in   the
synchronization linkage                      (7) mounted to the moving mass.

   The present invention relates to a method for avoiding
   unwanted           safety         gear       tripping            in    a     safety        stopping
   system        of      an    elevator         system,           a   safety        stopping         sys
   tem, and an elevator system.
10
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   In prior art,               an elevator system comprises an elevator
   car which            is    connected           to    a    counterweight              via     suspen
   sion       ropes       which go          over      a   traction          wheel       driven      by   a
15 hoisting          machine.             The    elevator           car      and      the     counter
   weight        are       both     guided        vertically            by     respective          guide
   rails        inside        a    shaft.       In      the     following,            the     elevator
   car      and    the      counterweight               are     referred          to    as    the    mov
   ing       mass.         The      elevator           system         further          comprises         a
20 safety        circuit          having        a    plurality            of    normally          closed
   safety        switches            for     monitoring             the      safety        status      of
   the elevator in normal operation.                                   If the        safety of the
   elevator          is      somehow        compromised,               at    least       one     of   the
   safety switches is                     opened, the hoisting machine                            is de
25 energized            and      machinery          brakes          are     engaged          so    as  to
   decelerate the moving mass for quick stop.
   The       elevator           system         further           comprises            an     overspeed
   governor system for the elevator car, which has a gov
30 ernor        rope        loop      directed           up     from       the      elevator         car,
   over an         overspeed governor pulley, then down and under
   a    tension         weight        pulley        connected           to    a    tension        weight
   and      then up         again       to    the     elevator          car     to be        connected
   to     a   synchronization                linkage          for     tripping          an    elevator
35 car       safety         gear.       A    corresponding                overspeed           governor
   system can be attached to the counterweight.

                                               2
   The synchronization linkage has synchronization levers
   which make          the     safety   gear     of the moving mass            to en
   gage the guide rails               of the moving mass when at least
 5 a predetermined              force   is    applied    to     the    synchroniza
   tion    linkage by the governor                 rope.    This predetermined
   force     is    acting against           spring   forces      of    synchroniza
   tion lever springs such that the synchronization lever
   engages       the safety gear when the force                    applied by the
10 governor rope exceeds the synchronization lever spring
   force.       The     overspeed       governor     system       supervises         the
   speed of the moving mass, and, if this speed exceeds a
   predetermined           tripping       speed    which     is    above     a   rated
   speed      of     the      elevator,       it   activates        the    machinery
15 quick     stop      operation      and,      simultaneously,         decelerates
   the   governor         rope.     This     deceleration        of   the   governor
   rope acts against the spring forces of synchronization
   lever     springs       such    that the       synchronization         lever en
   gages     the safety gear,            bringing     the elevator          car    into
20 an emergency stop.
   To summarize,           a quick      stop     operation      of the machinery
   is  initiated          whenever     the elevator        safety       circuit      in
   dicates a compromised safety status of the elevator.
25 Additionally,            if   the   compromised        safety       status     is     a
   result       of    an   overspeed       condition     of    the    moving mass,
   detected by overspeed governor,                    an emergency          stop op
   eration       is     activated      by    engaging     the     safety     gear      of
   the moving mass.
30
   However,        in    high    rise    elevators,      the     elevator      travel
   and speed increase such that the inertia of the gover
   nor rope increases substantially. This brings a new
   challenge         during      elevator      quick   stops      carried      out     by
35 the   hoisting         machine      brakes.      Namely,       when    the    over
   speed governor rope having the increased length decel
   erate     during       the    above     explained     quick      stop,    a   large

                                          3
   force    is    applied   to    the    synchronization            linkage,        be
   cause    the     inertia   of    the    overspeed      governor            rope   is
   large.     As   a result,     the decelerating          governor            rope  is
   capable      of    producing      forces      to   the     synchronization
 5 linkage      which    exceed    the    needed     force       to     engage      the
   safety      gear   when   the    moving     mass    is    decelerated.            In
   other    words,     the  safety      gear    might be        unwantedly          en
   gaged or tripped during quick                stop    although           the speed
   of the moving mass          has    not exceeded the predetermined
10 tripping speed for engaging the safety gear.
   One solution for preventing unwanted safety gear trip
   ping   is    to   increase     the    synchronization            lever        spring
   force.      However,    this    has    an   effect     on     the       design    of
15 the overspeed        governor     since the European               lift       stand
   ard  EN-81-20       code   requires       that   the    tensile          force    in
   the overspeed        governor     rope produced         by the governor,
   when tripped,        shall be     twice the force            that is          neces
   sary to engage the safety gear via the synchronization
20 linkage.       Stronger      synchronization           leads          to     bigger
   overspeed       governor     rope     tensile      forces         and,        conse
   quently a stronger and, thus, heavier overspeed gover
   nor rope due to required              safety factor.           If     one wishes
   to increase the force required for tripping the safety
25 gear   by     increasing      the    synchronization             lever        spring
   force     to   oppose    the    inertial       force     of      the      governor
   rope, then, due to the EN-81-20 code requirement,                                the
   tensile strength of the governor rope would have to be
   increased       which   would    cause     the   need      for      redesigning
30 of  the     overspeed    governor       system.     It    is     evident        that
   this   will      finally   lead     to   elevator      systems           in    which
   there    is   no more    feasible       design window          for overspeed
   governor and safety gear system.

   and     means        for     preventing            the      overspeed          governor        rope

   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   According            to    a      first       aspect,         the      present         invention
   provides          a    method          for      avoiding         unwanted         safety       gear
15 tripping          in     a    safety         stopping         system        of    an     elevator
   system. The            safety stopping system comprises                                a machin
   ery brake for decelerating a moving mass                                        so as to per
   form       a   quick       stop       of     the    moving         mass,      a   safety       gear
   mounted         to    the     moving mass,              an    overspeed          governor,        an
20 overspeed           governor           rope       connected          to    the    moving       mass
   of    the     elevator           system,         and     a   synchronization               linkage
   mounted          to    the       moving         mass       for     tripping        the       safety
   gear,        the     synchronization                 linkage         comprising           a   lever
   arm      having         a    first         end     pivotally            connected           to  the
25 overspeed           governor          rope       and    a   second        end fixedly          con
   nected to a spindle shaft to which a safety gear trip
   ping       arm     for     tripping            the     safety        gear     is     connected.
   According            to    the      invention           kinetic          energy       caused      by
   inertia         of     the       overspeed          governor          rope      to    the     lever
30 arm     is    dissipated            by      implementing            fluid      viscous        damp
   ing to dampen the rotary movement of the spindle shaft
   to prevent            unwanted           safety       gear      tripping         when     the   up
   wards        movement          of     the      moving       mass       is    decelerated          by
   the      machinery          brake         to     perform         a    quick      stop       of  the
35 moving mass.

                                            5
   The technical       effect     of the invention          is   that    it     pre
   vents the overspeed governor rope inertial forces                            from
   unwantedly engaging the safety gear. Further, existing
   overspeed     governor       components       can   be    used    to     higher
 5 travels     in    high-rise         elevators      without      redesigning
   them because unintended and unwanted activation of the
   safety gears does not happen in case of unplanned rap
   id stopping upwards.
10 In   an   embodiment       of     the     method,    the    fluid     viscous
   damping is      performed      by a fluid viscous            damper      acting
   on a member of the synchronization linkage.
   n an embodiment of the method, the fluid viscous damp
15 ing   is   performed     by     a    fluid   viscous     damper     cylinder
   acting    on   an    arm or       a    rod  connected      to  the    spindle
   shaft.
   In  an embodiment       of the method,          fluid viscous         damping
20 is performed by an oil damper cylinder.
   In an embodiment of the method, the damping force is a
   non-linear      function      of    velocity     of   a  piston     relative
   to a cylinder of the fluid viscous damper cylinder.
25
   In  an embodiment        of    the method,       in   velocities        of the
   piston    relative     to    the     cylinder    of   the    fluid viscous
   damper    cylinder     smaller        than a predetermined          velocity
   the damping force         is    arranged     to increase       more      forci
30 bly than in higher velocities.
   In  an embodiment       of the method,          the moving mass           is   an
   elevator car.
35 In  an   embodiment     of    the method,        the moving mass            is   a
   counterweight.

   According      to   a   second      aspect,      the    present   invention
   provides a safety stopping arrangement for an elevator
   system     for stopping        the movement         of   a moving   mass.    T
   the   safety     stopping      arrangement        comprises    a machinery
 5 brake    for decelerating          a moving mass         so as  to perform
   a quick stop of the moving mass, a safety gear mounted
   to   the    moving    mass,      an   overspeed      governor,     an   over
   speed    governor      rope    attached       to   a moving mass      of the
   elevator system, and a synchronization linkage mounted
10 to the     moving mass        for   tripping       the   safety   gear,   the

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   In  the following,        description will be made               to embodi
15 ments    of   the    present      invention.     It  is    to     be    under
   stood,    however,      that    the   description     is    given       by way
   of   example      only,   and     that    the   described      embodiments
   are by no means         to be understood         as limiting the pre
   sent invention thereto.
20
   In particular, different exemplifying embodiments will
   be  described using,         as    an example     of an elevator           sys
   tem to which the embodiments may be applied, an eleva
   tor    system     as   depicted      and    explained     in     connection
25 with Figs. 1 to 3.
   It  is   to be     noted that      the following examples             and em
   bodiments       are   to  be    understood      only   as    illustrative
   examples.       Although      the     specification       may      refer     to
30 "an",    "one",     or "some"      example(s)     or embodiment(s)           in
   several locations, this does not necessarily mean that
   each    such reference       is    related    to the    same example(s)
   or embodiment(s),         or that      the feature      only applies         to
   a  single      example     or    embodiment.      Single      features       of
35 different     embodiments        may also be      combined to provide
   other    embodiments.       Furthermore,        terms    like      "compris
   ing"   and   "including"       should be understood           as    not    lim-

                                             9
   iting    the    described         embodiments       to    consist         of  only
   those features that have been mentioned;                        such examples
   and embodiments may also contain features, structures,
   units,    modules      etc.      that     have   not   been       specifically
 5 mentioned.
   The general elements and functions of described eleva
   tor systems, details of which also depend on the actu
   al type of elevator system, are known to those skilled
10 in  the art,      so that a detailed description                      thereof    is
   omitted herein.          However, it is to be noted that                       sev
   eral   additional        devices        and    functions      besides        those
   described     below     in     further      detail   may be        employed      in
   an elevator system.
15
   Figure    1 shows      an   elevator        system and      Figure        2  and    3
   show   details     of the       same.      The  elevator       system has        an
   elevator    car    2   and     a counterweight         3,   which        are  both
   acting as a moving mass and are connected to each oth
20 er by suspension ropes 19.                 The suspension ropes 19 are
   going around a traction               wheel    20 which is         driven by a
   hoisting    machine       21.    A machinery        brake     1    is    arranged
   in connection with the hoisting machine for decelerat
   ing a moving mass           2,    3   so as    to perform        a quick       stop
25 of the moving mass.             Because      of the heavy mass hanging
   on both ends        of   the     suspension      ropes     19,     the     suspen
   sion   ropes    19   do    not    slide      on the   traction          wheel   20.
   When   the   traction       wheel      20   is  driven     by    the hoisting
   machine    21    and    rotates,        the    elevator     car       2   and   the
30 counterweight 3 move. The elevator car 2 and the coun
   terweight     3  are guided by guide rails                 16 and        17 which
   are mounted      to the walls           of the shaft 18          in     which the
   elevator system 1 is provided.
35 Figure 1 further shows an overspeed governor system 15
   for   the   elevator       car      2  which    comprises        an     overspeed
   governor     rope    5   both      ends     of which     are     connected       to

                                                      10
   the      elevator          car     2     (the       moving          mass).        The       governor
   rope       5   goes       around       a     governor           pulley         22    on      the      top
   side      of     the    elevator         system        and       goes      around        a     tension
   weight        pulley        23    connected           to     a    tension         weight           24  on
 5 the     bottom        side      of    the      elevator            system.        The       governor
   rope      5   is    connected         to      the elevator              car     2   via       a    lever
   arm     8    of    a   synchronization                 linkage          7    having         tripping
   arms       12     for      tripping          a     safety         gear       4    against            both
   guide rails            16 of the elevator car 2.

   Figure 1 further shows                       an overspeed governor system 15
   for     the      counterweight             3,     which       is     similar        to      that      ex
   plained for the                elevator car 2.                 The      overspeed governor
   system        15     for     the    counterweight                 3    comprises           an      over
15 speed governor rope                   6 both ends of which are connected
   to    the      counterweight               7     (the      moving         mass) .       The        over
   speed governor rope                   6 goes         around a governor pulley 22
   on the top            side of the elevator system and goes                                       around
   a    tension          weight       pulley           23     connected             to    a       tension
20 weight        24    on     the    bottom         side      of      the     elevator            system.
   The     governor          rope     6    connected             to    the      counterweight               7
   via     a    lever      arm 8      of     a    synchronization                 linkage           7   hav
   ing      tripping          arms      12      for      tripping            a    safety          gear      4
   against both guide rails of the counterweight 7.
25
   Referring           to    Figures         2    and      3,     a    safety        stopping            ar
   rangement          has      a    synchronization                  linkage         7   is      mounted
   to    the       moving        mass,       such       as      the      elevator           car        2  or
   counterweight               3   for     tripping           the      safety         gear        4.      In
30 this       example         of     Figure         2    and      3    the       synchronization
   linkage 7 is             explained in connection with the elevator
   car     2,     but     the     counterweight                3    can      be    equipped             with
   similar          synchronization                linkage          7    as    shown        in      Figure
   1.    The      synchronization                 linkage          7    is     arranged            in    the
35 lower beam 25 of the sling 26 of the elevator car 2.

                                                          11
   The synchronization linkage 7 comprises                                             a lever arm 8.
   The     lever         arm      8 has       a   first         end      9 pivotally             connected
   to    the       overspeed            governor            rope       5.     A   spindle         shaft         11
   is     rotatably              bearing-mounted                    to      the     lower        beam         25.
 5 The      second          end     10    of     the      lever        arm      8   is    fixedly           con
   nected to the spindle                         shaft 11.            A safety gear tripping
   arm 12         is      also      fixedly         connected              to    the     spindle          shaft
   11     so      that        turning          of      the       lever         arm     8    rotates           the
   spindle           shaft        and     turns         the      safety         gear      tripping            arm
10 12.      Another            safety       gear         tripping            arm      12    is     arranged
    (on     the       right        side      of     Figures           2     and    3)     for      tripping
   another          safety          gear      4   acting          in    co-operation              with        an
   other         guide          rail      16.      The         synchronization                  linkage           7
   comprises             a    connecting           rod        27    which        transmits           the      mo
15 tion       of      the       spindle         shaft         11     to     said       another          safety
   gear       tripping             arm     12.     An       extension            spring         28     is     ar
   ranged         in     the      synchronization                   linkage         7   to     oppose         the
   tripping action. A viscous                               fluid damper cylinder 13                            is
   arranged to dissipate                         kinetic energy caused by inertia
20 of the overspeed governor rope 5 to the lever arm 8 to
   dampen         the        rotary        movement             of    the       spindle         shaft         11.
   The      fluid        viscous         damper          dissipates              energy        by pushing
   fluid through an orifice, producing a damping pressure
   which creates                 a   force.        The       fluid       viscous         damper         cylin
25 der     acts        on     an    auxiliary            arm 14         which       is    also        fixedly
   attached            to     the      spindle         shaft         11.      In    some       other         (not
   shown         embodiments)               the       fluid         viscous          damper         may       ar
   ranged          to      act      on    any      suitable             moving         member          of     the
   synchronization                    linkage         7,     such      as      arm     14    or    tripping
30 arm 12         or      connecting            rod      27     connected           directly            or    in
   directly            to     the     spindle         shaft         11.      In   this       example          the
   fluid        viscous            damper        cylinder            13     compresses            when        the
   inertia            of     the       overspeed            governor            rope       5    urges         the
   lever        arm       8   to     turn      the       spindle          shaft       11    in    a     clock
35 wise        direction.               In    some         other        embodiment              the       fluid
   viscous          damper          cylinder          13 may          be     arranged          to     rebound
   in that situation.

                                           12
   Preferably,       the    fluid     viscous       damper    13   is    an  oil
   damper cylinder.
 5 The fluid viscous          damper     cylinder      13 has at least two
   damping ratios         depending on the velocity              of the fluid
   viscous    damper      cylinder      13.    The   damping    ratio    of  the
   fluid viscous damper cylinder may be adjustable.
10 Figure    4 shows      an example       of how the damping         force   of
   the fluid viscous          cylinder       13 can be arranged         to vary
   in  function      of the velocity          of the piston       relative    to
   the cylinder of the fluid viscous damper cylinder. The
   horizontal axis of the diagram represents the compres
15 sion   (or rebound) velocity of the fluid viscous damper
   cylinder.    The    vertical      axis     of the     diagram represents
   the damping force F.            The damping force          F increases     as
   a  function      of   the   velocity       v.   In   the   shown   example,
   the damping force is a non-linear function of velocity
20 of a piston       relative      to a cylinder         of the    fluid vis
   cous damper       cylinder.      In    smaller velocities         the damp
   ing   force   is    arranged      to    increase     more   forcibly     than
   in  higher velocities          where      the damping      force    increase
   is  lightened.      For example,          the damping      force    function
25 F(v) may be parabolic.
     This   ensures     that    the    damping     force    will   not be    too
   high   in  a normal       emergency       stop situation       wherein the
   overspeed governor          system trips         the   safety gears,      and
   this   operation       will    not    be   substantially       delayed    due
30 to the provision of the fluid viscous damping.
   Although    the    invention has been            the described in        con
   junction    with     a   certain     type     of the    elevator     system,
   it should be understood that the invention is not lim
35 ited to any certain type. While the present inventions
   have been described in connection with a number of ex
   emplary embodiments,            and    implementations,        the   present

                           13
inventions are not so limited,  but rather cover vari
ous modifications,  and equivalent arrangements, which
fall within the purview of prospective claims.
