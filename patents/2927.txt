        SPRING MOTOR FOR DRIVE FOR COVERINGS FOR ARCHITECTURAL
                                              OPENINGS
[0001]      This application claims priority from U.S. Application S.N, 12/427,132, filed April 21,
2009.
[0002]      The present invention relates to a spring motor and transmission combination which
can be used for extending and retracting or for tilting coverings for architectural openings such
as Venetian blinds, pleated shades, vertical blinds, other expandable materials, and other
mechanical devices.
Background:
[0003]      Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
general knowledge in the field.
[0004]      Typically, a blind transport system will have a head rail which both supports the
covering and hides the mechanisms used to extend and retract or open and close the
covering, Similar systems are used for horizontal blinds and for vertical blinds. One such blind
system is described in U. S, Patent No. 6,536,503, Modular Transport System for Coverings
for Architectural
[0005]      Openings, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. In the typical top/down
horizontal product, the raising and lowering of the covering is done by a lift cord or lift cords
suspended from the head rail and attached to the bottom rail {also referred to as the moving
rail or bottom slat), The opening and closing of the covering is typically accomplished with
ladder tapes (and/or tilt cables) which run along the front and back of the stack of slats, The lift
cords usually run along the front and back of the stack of slats or through holes in the slats, In
these types of coverings, the force required to raise the covering is at a minimum when it is
fully lowered (fully extended), since the weight of the slats is supported by the ladder tape so
that only the bottom rail is being raised at the onset. As the covering is raised further, the slats
stack up onto the bottom rail, transferring the weight of the slats from the ladder tape to the lift
cords, so progressively greater lifting force is required to raise the covering as it approaches
the fully raised (fully retracted) position. Some window covering products are built in the
reverse (bottom up), where the moving rail, instead of being at the bottom of the window

                                                  -2
covering bundle, is at the top of the window covering bundle, between the bundle and the head
rail, such that the bundle is normally accumulated at the bottom of the window when the
covering is retracted and the moving rail is at the top of the window covering, next to the head
rail, when the covering is extended. There are also composite products which are able to do
both, to go top down and/or bottom up. In horizontal window covering products, there is an
external force of gravity against which the operator is acting to move the expandable material
from one of its expanded and retracted positions to the other.
[0006]      In contrast to a blind, in a top down shade, such as a shear horizontal window
shade, the entire light blocking material typically wraps around a rotator rail as the shade is
raised, Therefore, the weight of the shade is transferred to the rotator rail as the shade is
raised, and the force required to raise the shade is thus progressively lower as the shade (the
light blocking element) approaches the fully raised (fully open) position. Of course, there are
also bottom up shades and composite shades which are able to do both, to go top down
and/or bottom up. In the case of a bottom/up shade, the weight of the shade is transferred to
the rotator rail as the shade is lowered, mimicking the weight operating pattern of a top/down
blind.
[0007]      In the case of vertically-oriented window coverings, which move from side to side
rather than up and down, a first cord is usually used to pull the covering to the retracted
position and then a second cord (or second end of the first cord in the case of a cord loop) is
used to pull the covering to the extended position. In this case, the operator is not acting
against gravity. However, these window coverings may also be arranged to have another
outside force or load other than gravity, such as a spring, against which the operator would act
to move the expandable material from one position to another
[0008]     A wide variety of drive mechanisms is known for extending and retracting coverings
- moving the coverings vertically or horizontally or tilting slats. A number of these drive
mechanisms may use a spring motor to provide the catalyst force (and/or to supplement the
operator supplied catalyst force) to move the coverings.

Description:
[0072]     Figures 1 through 32 and Figure 35 illustrate various embodiments of spring motors.
These spring motors can be used for extending and retracting window coverings by raising and
lowering them, moving them from side to side, or tilting their slats open and closed. Window
coverings or coverings for architectural openings may also be referred to herein more
specifically as blinds or shades.
[0073]     Figure 1 is a partially exploded, perspective view of a first embodiment of a cellular
shade 100 utilizing a spring motor and drag brake combination 102.
[0074]     The shade 100 of Figure 1 includes a head rail 108, a bottom rail 110, and a cellular
shade structure 112 suspended from the head rail 108 and attached to both the head rail 108
and the bottom rail 110. The covering material 112 has a width that is essentially the same as
the length of the head rail 108 and of the lift shaft 118, and it has a height when fully extended
that is essentially the same as the length of the lift cords (not shown in this view but two sets
are shown in Figure 6A), which are attached to the bottom rail 110 and to lift stations 116 such
that when the lift shaft 118 rotates, the lift spools on the lift stations 116 also rotate, and the lift
cords wrap onto or unwrap from the lift stations 116 to raise or lower the bottom rail 110 and
thus raise or lower the shade 100. These lift stations 116 and their operating principles are
disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 6,536,503 "Modular Transport System for Coverings for
Architectural Openings", issued March 25, 2003, which is hereby incorporated herein by
reference. End caps 120 close the ends of the head rail 108 and may be used to mount the
cellular product 100 to the architectural opening.
[0075]     Disposed between the two lift stations 116 is a spring motor and drag brake
combination 102 which is functionally interconnected to the lift stations 116 via the lift shaft 118
such that, when the spring motor rotates, the lift shaft 118 and the spools on the lift stations
116 also rotate, and vice versa, as discussed in more detail below. The use of spring motors to
raise and lower window blinds was also disclosed in the aforementioned U. S. Patent No.
6,536,503 "Modular Transport System for Coverings for Architectural Openings".
[0076]     In order to raise the shade, the user lifts up on the bottom rail 110. The spring motor
assists the user in raising the shade. At the same time, the drag brake portion of the spring

                                                -12
motor and drag brake combination 102 exerts a resistance to this upward motion of the shade.
As explained below, the drag brake exerts two different torques to resist rotation, depending
upon the direction of rotation. In this embodiment, the resistance to the upward motion that is
exerted by the drag brake is the lesser of the two torques (referred to as the release torque),
as explained in more detail below. This release torque, together with system friction and the
torque due to the weight of the shade, is large enough to prevent the spring motor from
causing the shade 100 to creep up once the shade has been released by the user.
[0077]      To lower the shade, the user pulls down on the bottom rail 110, with the force of
gravity assisting the user in this task. While pulling down on the bottom rail 100, the spring
motor is rotated so as to increase the potential energy of the flat spring (by winding the flat
spring of the motor onto its output spool 122, as explained in more detail below). The drag
brake portion of the combination 102 exerts a resistance to this downward motion of the
shade, and this resistance is the larger of the two torques (referred to as the holding torque)
exerted by the drag brake, as explained in more detail below. This holding torque, combined
with the torque exerted by the spring motor and system friction, is large enough to prevent the
shade 100 from falling down. Thus, the shade remains in the position where it is released by
the operator regardless of where the shade is released along its full range of travel; it neither
creeps upwardly nor falls downwardly when released.
[0078]      Referring now to Figure 2, the spring motor and drag brake combination 102 includes
a motor output spool 122, a flat spring 124 (also referred to as a motor spring 124), a stepped
coil spring 126, a motor housing portion 128, and a brake housing portion 130. The two
housing portions 128, 130 connect together to form a complete housing, It should be noted
that, in this embodiment, the brake housing portion 130 extends beyond the brake mechanism
to enclose part of the motor as well.
[0079]      The motor output spool 122 (See also Figure 5) includes a spring take- up portion
132, which is flanked by beveled left and right shoulders 134, 136, respectively, and defines an
axially oriented flat recess 138 including a raised button 140 (See Figure 5) for securing a first
end 142 of the flat spring 124 to the motor output spool 122. The first end 142 of the flat spring
124 is threaded into the flat recess 138 of the spring take-up portion 132 until the raised button
140 of the spring take-up portion 132 snaps through the opening 144 at the first end 142 of the
flat spring 124, releasably securing the flat spring 124 to the motor output spool 122.

                                                   -13
[0080]      The motor output spool 122 further includes a drag brake drum portion 146
extending axially to the right of the right shoulder 136. Stub shafts 148, 150 extend axially from
each end of the motor output spool 122 for rotational support of the motor output spool 122 as
described later.
[0081]      The flat spring 124 is a flat strip of metal which has been wound tightly upon itself as
depicted in Figure 2. As discussed above, a first end 142 of the spring 124 defines a through
opening 144 for releasably securing the flat spring 124 to the motor output spool 122. The
routing of the flat spring 124, as seen from the vantage point of Figure 2, is for the end 142 of
the flat spring 124 to go under the motor output spool 122 and into the flat 138 until the button
140 snaps into the through opening 144 of the flat spring 124.
[0082]      Referring now to the coil spring 126, it resembles a traditional coil spring except that
it defines two different coil diameters. (It should be noted that the coil diameter is just one
characteristic of the coil. Another characteristic is its wire diameter or wire cross-sectional
dimension.) The first coil portion 152 has a smaller coil diameter and defines an inner diameter
which is just slightly smaller than the outside diameter of the drag brake drum 146, The second
coil portion 154 has a larger coil diameter and defines an outer diameter which is just slightly
larger than the inside diameter of the corresponding cavity 156 (also referred to as the housing
bore 156 or drag brake bore 156) defined by the brake housing 130, as described in more
detail below.
[0083]      The brake housing portion 130 defines a cylindrical cavity 156 (which, as indicated
earlier is also referred to as the drag brake housing bore 156) which is just slightly smaller in
diameter than the outer diameter of the second coil portion 154 of the stepped coil spring 126.
The brake housing portion 130 includes an internal hollow shaft projection 158, which, together
with a similar and matching internal hollow shaft projection 160 (See Figure 5) in the motor
housing portion 128 defines a flat spring storage spool 162 which defines a through opening
164 extending through the housing portions 128, 130. As explained later, this through opening
164 may be used as a pass-through location for a shaft (such as a lift shaft or a tilt shaft),
allowing the placement of two independent drives in very close parallel proximity to each other,
resulting in the possibility of using a narrower head rail 108 than might otherwise be possible.
[0084]      In Figure 5, the first coil portion 152 of the stepped coil spring 126 is shown as being
practically embedded in the drag brake drum portion 146, and the second coil portion 154 is
similarly shown as being practically embedded in the drag brake bore 156. In fact, these coil

                                                 -14
portions 152, 154 are not actually embedded into their respective parts 146, 156, but are
shown in this manner to represent the fact that there is an interference fit between the coil
portions 152, 154 and their respective drum 146 and housing bore 156. It is the amount of this
interference fit as well as the wire diameter or the wire cross-sectional dimension of the
stepped coil spring 126 which dictates the release torque and the holding torque which must
be overcome in order to cause the brake drum 146 to rotate relative to the housing 130 in a
first direction and a second direction, respectively. These two torques may also be referred to
as component torques, since they are the torques exerted by or on the drag brake component,
as opposed to system torque, which is the torque exhibited by the system as a whole and
which may also include torques due to the spring motor portion of the combination 102, friction
torques, torque due to the weight of the shade, and so forth.
[0085]      The coil spring 126 exerts torques against both the brake drum 146 and the bore 156
of the housing 130, and these torques resist rotation of the brake drum 146 relative to the
housing 130 in both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions. The amount of torque
exerted by the coil spring 126 against the brake drum 146 and the bore 156 varies depending
upon the direction of rotation of the brake drum 146 relative to the housing 130, and the place
where slippage occurs changes depending upon the direction of rotation. In order to facilitate
this description, the coil spring torque that must be overcome in order to rotate the brake drum
in one direction relative to the housing will be referred to as the holding torque, and the coil
spring torque that must be overcome in order to rotate the brake drum in the other direction
relative to the housing will be referred to as the release torque.
[0086]      The holding torque occurs when the output spool and brake drum rotate in a
counterclockwise direction relative to the housing 130 (as seen from the vantage point of
Figure 2) which tends to open up or expand the coil spring 126 away from the drum portion
146 and toward the bore 156 of the housing 130. In this situation, the drag brake drum portion
146 slips past the first coil portion 152 of the coil spring 126, while the second coil portion 154
of the coil spring 126 locks onto the housing bore 156. This holding torque is the higher of the
two component torques of this drag brake component, and, in this embodiment, occurs when
the flat spring 124 is winding onto the output spool 122 (and unwinding from the storage spool
162, increasing the potential energy of the device 102), which also is when the shade 100 is
being pulled down by the user with the assistance of gravitational force.
[0087]      Thus, when the user pulls down on the bottom rail 110 to overcome the holding
torque, the flat spring 124 winds onto the output spool, and the drum 146 slips relative to the

                                                -15
coil spring 126. The holding torque is designed to be sufficient to prevent the shade 100 from
falling downwardly when the user releases it at any point along the travel distance of the shade
112. (Of course, this arrangement could be reversed, so that the counterclockwise rotation
occurs when the user lifts on the bottom rail.)
[0088]      Similarly, when the bottom rail 110 of the shade 100 is lifted up, the output spool 122
and brake drum 146 rotate in a clockwise direction relative to the bore 156 of the housing 130
(as seen from Figure 2). The flat spring 124 winds onto the storage spool 162 and unwinds
from the output spool 132, aiding the user in the raising of the shade 100. Also, the stepped
coil spring 126 rotates in the same clockwise direction, causing the coil spring 126 to contract
away from the housing bore 156 and toward the drum 146. This causes the first coil portion
152 to clamp down on the drag brake drum portion 146 and the second coil portion 154 to
shrink away from the bore 156. The release torque (the lower of the two torques for this drag
brake component) occurs when the stepped coil spring 126 slips relative to the housing bore
156.
[0089]      Thus, when the operator lifts up on the bottom rail 110, the flat spring 124 winds up
onto the storage spool 162 and the coil spring slips relative to the bore 156 as the shade rises.
[0090]      To summarize, the holding torque is the larger of the two torques for this drag brake
component, and it occurs when the coil spring 126 grows or expands such that the second coil
portion 154 expands against and "locks" onto the bore 156 of the housing 130, and the first coil
portion 152 expands from, and slips relative to, the drag brake drum portion 146. The release
torque is the smaller of the two torques for the drag brake component, and it occurs when the
drag-brake spring 126 collapses such that the second coil portion 154 contracts away from and
slips relative to the bore 156 of the housing 130, and the first coil portion 152 collapses and
"locks" onto the drag brake drum portion 146. Both torques for the drag brake component
provide a resistance to rotation of the drum 146 and of the output spool 122 relative to the
housing 130. The amount of torque for each direction of rotation of the drag brake and which of
the torques will be larger depends upon the particular application,
[0091]      To assemble the spring motor and drag brake combination 102, the flat spring 124 is
secured to the output spool 122 as has already been described. The stepped coil spring 126 is
slid over the drag brake drum portion 146 of the output spool 122, and this assembly is placed
inside the brake housing portion 130 with the central opening 166 of the flat spring 124 sliding
over the hollow shaft projection 158 of the brake housing portion 130 and the stepped coil

                                                  -16
spring 126 disposed inside the drag brake bore 156. The motor housing portion 128 then is
mated to the brake housing portion 130. The two housing portions 128, 130 snap together with
the pegs 168 and bridges 170 shown (which are fully described in the U. S. Patent application
S/N 11/382,089 "Snap-Together Design for Component Assembly", filed on May 8, 2006,
which is hereby incorporated herein by reference). The stub shafts 148, 150 of the output
spool 122 ride on corresponding through openings 172, 174 (See Figure 5) in the motor
housing portion 128 and the drag brake drum portion 146, respectively, for rotatably supporting
the output spool 122.
[0092]     As seen in Figure 5, the flat spring 124 is shown in the "fully discharged" position, all
wound onto the storage spool 162. The stepped coil spring 126 is shown in an intermediate
position wherein the first coil portion 152 is tightly wound around the drag brake drum portion
146, and the second coil portion 154 is also tightly wound against the drag brake bore 156. As
explained earlier, as the bottom rail 110 of the shade 100 is pulled downwardly by the user, the
stepped coil spring 126 expands or opens up such that the second coil portion 154 locks tightly
onto the drag brake bore 156, while the first coil portion 152 expands away from the drag
brake drum portion 146, which allows the brake to slip at the brake drum portion 146. at the
higher of the two torques for the drag brake component, which is referred to as the holding
torque. The user must overcome this holding torque as well as the torque required to wind the
flat spring 24 onto the output spool 122 and any other system torques in order to lower the
shade 100, and these are also the torques which prevent the shade from falling downwardly
once the user releases the shade 100.
[0093]      Figure 1 shows how the spring motor and drag brake combination 102 may be
installed in a shade 100. Since the lift shaft 118 goes completely through the spring motor and
drag brake combination 102 (via the axially- aligned through opening 176 in the output spool
122), the spring motor and drag brake combination 102 may be installed anywhere along the
length of the head rail 108, either between the lift stations 116 or on either side of the lift
stations 116. This design gives much more mounting flexibility than that afforded by prior art
designs.
[0094]      Note in Figure 4 that this through opening 176 in the output spool 122 has a non
circular profile, In fact, in this particular embodiment, it has a "V notch profile 176 which
matches the similarly profiled lift shaft 118. Thus, rotation of the output spool 122 results in
corresponding rotation of the lift shaft 118 and vice versa.

                                                  -17
[0095]      The storage spool 162 is also a hollow spool, defining a through opening 164
through which another shaft, such as another lift shaft 1 18 may extend. However, this opening
164 does not mate with the shaft for driving engagement but simply provides a passageway for
the shaft to pass through. This results in a very compact arrangement for two independent
parallel drives as shown in Figure 6B, This is particularly desirable for the operation of a
bottom up/top down shade 1002 as shown in Figure 6A,
[0096]      The ability to mount a type of drive-controlling element such as a spring motor or a
brake anywhere along a plurality of shafts, as shown in Figure 6B, permits a wide range of
functionality to be achieved. The arrangement shown in Figure 6B uses one shaft 1022 to raise
and lower one part of the covering and another shaft 1024, parallel to the first shaft 1022, to
raise and lower another part of the covering, but the use of two or more shafts permits other
functions as well, For instance, one shaft could be used to raise and lower the covering and
the other could be used to tilt slats on the covering as described in U.S. Patent 6,536,503.
[0097]       Figures 6A and 6B depict a top down/ bottom up shade 1002, which uses two spring
motor and drag brake combinations 102, one for each lift shaft 1022, 1024, The shade 1002
includes a top rail 1004 with end caps 1006, a middle rail 1008 with end caps 1010, a bottom
rail 1012 with end caps 1014, a cellular shade structure 1016, spring motor and drag brake
combinations 102M 1 102B1 two bottom rail lift stations 1018, two middle rail lift stations 1020, a
bottom rail lift shaft 1022, and a middle rail lift shaft 1024.
[0098]       In the case of the top down/ bottom up shade 1002 of Figure 6B, the spring motor
and drag brake combinations 102M, 102B 1 the lift stations 1018, 1020, and the lift shafts 1022,
1024, are all housed in the top rail 1004. Both lift shafts 1022, 1024 pass completely through
both of the spring motor and drag brake combinations 102M, 102B, but each of the lift shafts
1022, 1024 engages only one of the spring motor and drag brake combinations and passes
through the other without engaging it. The front lift shaft 1024 operatively interconnects the two
lift stations 1020, the spring motor and drag brake combination 102M, and the middle rail 1008
via lift cords 1030 (See Figure 6A) but just passes through the other spring motor and drag
brake combination 102B. The rear lift shaft 1022 interconnects the two lift stations 1018, the
spring motor and drag brake combination 102B. and the bottom rail 1012 via lift cords 1032
(See Figure 6A), but just passes through the other spring motor and drag brake combination
102M.

                                                 -18
[0099]     In this instance, the middle rail 1008 may travel all the way up until it is resting just
below the top rail 1004, or it may travel all the way down until it is resting just above the bottom
rail 1012, or the middle rail 1008 may remain anywhere in between these two extreme
positions. The bottom rail 1012 may travel all the way up until it is resting just below the middle
rail 1008 (regardless of where the middle rail 1008 is located at the time), or it may travel all
the way down until it is extending the full length of the shade 1002, or the bottom rail 1012 may
remain anywhere in between these two extreme positions.
[00100]    Each lift shaft 1022, 1024 operates independently of the other, using its respective
components in the same manner as described above with respect to a single shaft system,
with the front shaft 1024 operatively connected to the middle rail 1008, and the rear shaft 1022
operatively connected to the bottom rail.
[00101]    Referring briefly to Figure 68, the spring motor and drag brake combinations 102B,
102M may be identical or they may differ in that the stepped coil springs 126 may have a
different wire diameter (or different wire cross section dimension) in order to customize the
holding and release torques for each brake. A larger diameter wire (or larger wire cross section
dimension) used in the stepped coil spring 126 results in higher holding and release torques.
Whether identical or not, the spring motor and drag brake combination 102B is "flipped over"
when installed, relative to the spring motor and drag brake combination 102M. The lift shaft
1022 for the bottom rail 1012 goes through the through opening 176 in the output spool 122
(and engages this output spool 122) of the spring motor and drag brake combination 102B. It
also passes through the through opening 164 of the storage spool 162 of the spring motor and
drag brake combination 102M. Similarly, the lift shaft 1024 for the middle rail 1008 goes
through the through opening 176 in the output spool 122 (and engages this output spool 122)
of the spring motor and drag brake combination 102M. It also passes through the through
opening 164 of the storage spool 162 of the other spring motor and drag brake combination
102B.
[00102]    It should be noted that it is possible to add more spring motors or more spring motor
and drag brake combinations, as desired, and that, because these components provide for the
shafts 1022, 1024 to pass completely through their housings, they may be located anywhere
along the shafts 1022, 1024, It should also be noted that this ability to have two or more shafts
passing completely through the housing of a spring-operated drive component, with at least
one shaft operatively engaging the spring and at least one other shaft not operatively engaging
the spring, permits a wide range of combinations of components within a system. The spring-

                                                 -19
operated drive component may be a spring motor alone, a spring brake alone, a combination
spring motor and spring brake as shown here, or other components.
Other Embodiments of Spring Motor and Drag Brake Combinations
[00103]    Figures 7-11 depict another embodiment of a spring motor and drag brake
combination 102'. A comparison with Figure 2 highlights the differences between this
embodiment 102' and the previously disclosed embodiment 102. This embodiment includes
two "conventional" coil springs 126S, 126L functionally linked together by a spring coupler 127'
instead of the single stepped coil spring 126, The first coil spring 126S has a smaller coil
diameter, and the second coil spring 126L has a larger coil diameter.
[00104]    The spring coupler 127' is a washer-like device which defines a longitudinal slot 178',
which receives the extended ends 180', 182' of the coil springs 126S, 126L, respectively, Since
the coil spring 126S has a smaller coil diameter, it fits inside the larger diameter coi! spring
126L, and the extended ends 180', 182* lie adjacent to each other within the slot 178', as
shown in Figure 10.
[00105]    The spring coupler 127' defines a central opening 184' which allows the spring
coupler 127' to slide over the stub shaft 150' of the output spool 122'. The spring coupler 127'
allows for the two springs 126S, 126L to be made of wires having different diameters (or
different wire cross-section dimensions, as the wires do not have to be circular in section as
these are) and still act as a single spring when the output spool 122% rotates. Figure 11 shov/s
the two coil spring 12 6 S1 126L1 functionally linked by the spring coupler 127' and mounted on
the output spool 122'
[00106]    This spring motor and drag brake combination 102' behaves in the same manner as
the spring motor and drag brake combination 102 described above, except that the use of two
coil springs 126S, 126L allows the flexibility to choose the wire cross section dimension for
each coil spring 126S, 126L individually. In this manner the correct (or the desired) brake
torques can be chosen more exactly for each application.
[00107]    For instance, Figure 7 depicts a larger wire cross section dimension used for the
smaller coil spring 126S which clamps around the drag brake drum portion 146' than the wire
cross section dimension used for the larger coil spring 126L which clamps inside the drag
brake bore 156'. Since the slip torques (the torques at which the coil spring slips past the
surface against which it is clamped) are a function of the diameter of the wire cross section

                                                -20
used for the coil springs (the larger the wire cross section dimension the higher the slip torque,
everything else being equal), the embodiment shown in Figure 7 has a larger holding torque
(the larger of the two torques) than the holding torque of a similar spring motor and drag brake
combination having the smaller spring coil 126S of made from a smaller cross-section wire.
[00108]     Figures 12 and 13-15B depict another embodiment of a spring motor and drag brake
combination 102". A comparison with Figure 2 quickly highlights the differences between this
embodiment 102" and the previously disclosed embodiment 102. This embodiment 102"
includes a number of identical or very similar components such as a motor output spool 122", a
flat spring 124" (or motor spring 124"), a motor housing portion 128", a brake housing portion
130", a drag brake drum portion 146". and coil springs 126". As discussed below, some of
these items are slightly different from those described with respect to the previous
embodiment, and this embodiment 102 " also has riding sleeves 127" which are desirable but
not strictly necessary for the operation of this spring motor and drag brake combination 102".
(Yet another embodiment 102*, shown in Figure 16, does not use the sleeves.)
[0100]      A readily apparent difference is that the drag brake drum portion 146" is a separate
piece which is rotatably supported on the shaft extension 148" of the motor output spool 122".
As may be appreciated from Figure 15A. the motor output spool 122" is rotatably supported on
the housing portions 128", 130", and the drag brake drum portion 146" is rotatably supported
on the shaft extension 148" of the motor output spool 122\ The motor output spool 122" and
the drag brake drum portion 146" have hollow shafts 176", 186" with non- circular profiles (See
also Figures 12 and 14) so as to engage the lift shaft 118.
[0101]      The brake housing portion 130" includes two "ears" 188" which define axially-aligned
slotted openings to releasably secure the curled ends 190" of the coil springs 126" as
discussed below.
[0102]      The riding sleeves 127" are discontinuous cylindrical rings, with a longitudinal cut
192", which allows the rings to "collapse" to a smaller diameter, Both riding sleeves 127" are
identical as are both of the coil springs 126" (though the coil springs 126 - may be of different
wire diameters if desired to achieve the desired torque), As will become clearer after the
explanation of the operation of this spring motor and drag brake combination 102", it is
possible to use only one set of riding sleeve 127" and coil spring 126" if desired and adequate.
The embodiment 102" of Figure 12 shows two sets of riding sleeves 127" and coil springs
126", used to obtain a larger holding torque (more braking power). Certainly, additional sets

                                                -21
could also be used if desired (and if able to be accommodated on the drag brake drum portion
146 '). Also, the use of the riding sleeves 127" is optional, as evidenced by the embodiment
102* of Figure 16 which is described in more detail later.
[0103]       The coil springs 126" may ride directly on the outer diameter of the drag brake drum
portion 146", but the use of the riding sleeves 127" allows for more flexibility in choosing
appropriate materials for the drag brake drum portion 146" and for the riding sleeves 127". For
instance, the riding sleeves 127" may be advantageously made from a material with some
flexibility (so that they can collapse onto the outer diameter of the drag brake drum portion
146"), and with some self-lubricating property, Furthermore, if riding sleeves 127" are used, it
is possible to simply replace the riding sleeves 127" in the event of high wear between the coil
springs 126" and the riding sleeves 127", instead of having to replace the drag brake drum
portion 146", The rest of the description describes only one set of riding sleeve 127" and coil
spring 126- (unless otherwise noted), with the understanding that two or more sets may also
be used with essentially the same operating principle but with possibly advantageous results
as discussed above.
[0104]       The flat spring 124" is assembled to the motor output spool 122" in the same manner
as has already been described for the motor output spool 122 of Figure 2. The assembled flat
spring 124" and motor output spool 122" are then assembled into the motor housing portion
128- and the brake housing portion 130" with the opening 166" of the flat spring 124 ' sliding
over the hollow shaft projections 158" and 160" of the motor housing portion 128" and the
brake housing portion 130", respectively,
[0105]       The riding sleeves 127- and the coil springs 126" are then assembled onto the drag
brake drum portion 146" as shown in Figure 15B1 wherein the riding sleeves 127" and the coil
springs 126" are mounted in series onto the outer diameter of the drag brake drum portion
146". The coil spring 126" is mounted onto its corresponding riding sleeve 127" such that the
curled end 190" of the coil spring 126" projects through the slotted opening 192" of the riding
sleeve 127", Each riding sleeve 127- includes circumferential flanges 194" at each end to
assist in keeping the coil spring 126" from slipping off its corresponding riding sleeve 127"
during operation of the spring motor and drag brake combination 102".
[0106]       The assembled drag brake drum portion 146", coil springs 126", and riding sleeves
127" are then mounted onto the extended shaft 148" of the motor output spool 122", making
sure that the curled end 190" of each coil spring 126" is caught in one of the slotted openings

                                                 - 22
188" of the brake housing portion 130". The drag brake drum portion 146" is rotated until the
non-circular profiles 176", 186" of the motor output spool 122" and of the drag brake drum
portion 146" respectively are aligned such that the lift shaft 118 can be inserted through the
entire assembly as shown in Figure 13.
[0107]      During operation, as shown from the vantage point of Figure 12, as the motor output
spool 122 - is rotated counterclockwise (corresponding to the lowering of the shade 100 and
the transfer of the flat spring 124" from the storage spool 162" to the motor output spool 122*),
both the motor output spool 122" and the drag brake drum portion 146" rotate in this
counterclockwise direction. The riding sleeves 127" are also urged to rotate in this same
direction (due to the friction between the riding sleeves 127" and the drag brake drum portion
146"), and the coil springs 126" are also urged to rotate in this same direction (due to the
friction between the riding sleeves 127" and the coil springs 126'). However, the curled ends
190" of the coil springs 126" are secured to the brake housing portion 130" and are prevented
from rotation, so, as the rest of the coil springs 126- begin rotating in the counterclockwise
direction, the coil springs 126" tighten onto the riding sleeves 127'. The riding sleeves 127"
collapse slightly onto the outer diameter of the drag brake drum portion 146 ", thus providing
an increased resistance to rotation of the drag brake drum portion 146" (and of the lift shaft
118 which is engaging the drag brake drum portion 146").
[0108]     When lifting the shade 100, the spring motor and drag brake combination 102"
assists the user as the flat spring 124" unwinds from the motor output spool 122" (which is
therefore rotating clockwise) and winds onto the storage spool 162", The drag brake drum
portion 146" also rotates clockwise, which urges the riding sleeves 127" and the coil springs
126" to rotate clockwise. Again, since the curled ends 190 of the coil springs 126" are secured
to the slotted openings 188" of the brake housing portion 130", the coil springs 126" "grow" or
expand, increasing their inside diameter and greatly reducing the braking torque on the riding
sleeves 127" and on the drum portion 146 '. The drag brake drum portion 146" is therefore able
to rotate with little resistance from the coil springs 126". The user thus can raise the shade 100
easily, assisted by the spring motor and drag brake combination 102".
[0109]      Figure 12A depicts the same embodiment of a spring motor and drag brake
combination 102' as Figure 12, except that one of the coil springs 126" has been flipped over
180 degrees relative to the coil spring 126", and it is made from a wire material which has a
thinner cross section. Now, when the drag brake drum portion 146" rotates clockwise, the
riding sleeves 127" and the coil springs 126" also to rotate clockwise. However, in this

                                                 -23
instance, clockwise rotation causes the second coil spring 126" to tighten down onto its riding
sleeve 127", reducing the inside diameter of the riding sleeve 127" and thus clamping down on
the drag brake drum portion 146". Since the cross sectional diameter of this second coil spring
126" is smaller than the cross sectional diameter of the first coil spring 126", the drag torque
applied to the drag brake drum portion 146" when it rotates in a clockwise direction is smaller
than the drag torque applied to the drag brake drum portion 146' when the rotation is in a
counterclockwise direction. If the cross-sectional dimension of the wire of the second coil
spring were greater than the cross-sectional dimension of the wire of the first coil spring 126",
then the braking torque would be greater in the clockwise direction. If the two coil springs 126"
were identical but still reversed from each other, then the braking torque would be the same in
both directions.
[0110]     Figures 16 and 17 depict another embodiment of a spring motor and drag brake
combination 102*. A comparison with Figure 12 shows that this embodiment 102* is
substantially identical to the previously disclosed embodiment 102" except that this
embodiment does not have the riding sleeves 127" and it only has a single coil spring 126*.
However, two or more such coil springs 126* may be used if desired, as was the case with the
previously described embodiment 102". The coil spring 126" rides directly on the outer
diameter of the drag brake drum portion 146* instead of using the riding sleeves 127". Other
than these differences, this spring motor and drag brake combination 102* operates in
essentially the same manner as the previously described embodiment 102".
[0111]     It should be noted that in this spring motor and drag brake combination 102*. as is
the case with all of the spring motor and drag brake combinations described herein, the coil
spring 126*" or the flat spring 124** may be omitted from the assembly. If the coil spring 126" is
omitted, the spring motor and drag brake combination 102* operates as a spring motor only,
with no drag brake capability. Likewise, if the flat spring 124** is omitted, the spring motor and
drag brake combination 102* operates as a drag brake only, with no motor capability.
[0112]     Figure 18 depicts another embodiment of a spring motor and drag brake combination
102*'. A comparison with Figure 5 shows that this embodiment 102** is substantially identical
to the embodiment 102 except that, in this spring motor and drag brake combination 102**, the
storage spool 162* is not a hollow spool as was the case for the previously described
embodiment 102. So, in this case, a lift shaft cannot pass through the storage spool 162*.
Other than this difference, this spring motor and drag brake combination 102** operates in
essentially the same manner as the embodiment 102.

                                                   - 24
[0113]      Figures 19 and 20 depict an embodiment of a flat spring (or motor spring), which
may be used in the embodiments described in this specification, if desired, The flat spring 124,
shown in step #1 , is made by tightly wrapping a flat metal strip onto itself, after which the coil
is stress relieved. This flat spring defines an inside diameter 196, which, in this embodiment, is
0.25 inches, The spring 124 as shown at the end of step #1 may be used in the embodiments
described above, or the spring may undergo additional steps, as shown in Figure 19.
[0114]      In step # 1, the coil spring 124 is first wound such that the first end 200 of the spring
124 is inside the coil and the second end 202 of the spring 124 is outside the coil. The coil
spring 124 is then stress relieved so it takes the coil set shown in Figure 1, with the spring
having a smaller radius of curvature at its first (inner) end and gradually and continuously
increasing to its second (outer) end. Next, in step #2, the coil spring 124 is reverse wound until
it reaches the position shown in step #3, in which the end 200 of the spring 124 (having the
smaller coil set radius of curvature) is now outside the coil and the end 202 of the spring 124
(having the larger coil set radius of curvature) is now inside the coil, with the coil set radius of
curvature gradually and continuously decreasing from the inner end to the outer end, This
reverse-wound coil 124R is not stress relieved again, Also, this reverse-wound coil 124R
defines an inside diameter 198 which preferably is slightly larger than the inside diameter 196
of the original flat spring 124. In this embodiment 124R, the inside diameter is 0.29 inches.
[0115]      Figure 20 graphically depicts the power assist torque curve for the standard-wound
flat spring 124 (as it stands at the end of step #1) and contrasts it with the torque curve for the
reverse-wound flat spring 124R at the end of step #3 of Figure 19. It depicts the torque forces
from the moment the springs begins to unwind (far left of the graph) until they are fully
unwound (this is the point, toward the middle of the graph, where the curves show a sharp
drop) and then back until the springs are fully rewound (far right of the graph), It can be
appreciated that the power assist torque curve for the reverse-wound flat spring 124R is a
flatter curve across the entire operating range of the spring than that of the standard-wound flat
spring 124. This flatter torque curve is typically a desirable characteristic for use in the type of
spring motors used for raising and lowering window coverings.
[0116]      Referring briefly now to Figure 2, if one replaces the flat spring 124 with the reverse
wound spring 124R of Figure 19, the end 200 of the reverse-wound spring 124 (which has the
smaller coil set radius of curvature) is the end 142 with the hole 144 that allows it to be
attached to the output spool 122. The lever arm acting on the output spool 122 is defined as
the distance from the axis of rotation of the output spool 122 to the surface 132 of the output

                                                 -25
spool 122. This lever arm is at a minimum when the reverse-wound spring 124R is
substantially unwound from the output spool 122 and substantially wound onto itself.
Therefore, with this arrangement, the portion of the reverse-wound spring 124R which has the
highest spring rate (the smallest coil set radius of curvature) is acting on the smallest lever
arm.
[0117]     When the reverse-wound spring 124R is substantially wound onto the output spool
122, the lever arm acting on the output spool 122 will have increased by the thickness of the
spring coil which is now wound onto the output spool 122. The lever arm will therefore be at a
maximum when the lowest spring rate of the reverse-wound spring 124R (the portion with the
largest coil set radius of curvature) is acting on the output spool. The end result is a smoothing
out of the power assist torque curve, as shown in Figure 20.
[0118]     It should be noted that, as shown in these preferred embodiments, when the flat
spring is wrapped in a clockwise direction in the storage position, it is wrapped counter
clockwise on the output spool 122, and vice-versa. In other words, the spring is wrapped in the
opposite direction in the storage position from the direction in which it is wrapped on the output
spool 122. This helps reduce friction.
[0119]     The procedure depicted in Figure 19 for reverse winding the spring 124 is but one
way to vary the spring rate along the length of the spring while maintaining a uniform thickness
and width of the metal strip that forms the spring. Similar results may be obtained using other
procedures, and it is possible to design the coil set curvature of the spring 124 to obtain a
torque curve with a negative slope, or any other desired slope.
[0120]     For instance, the metal strip that forms the spring 124 may be drawn across an anvil
at varying angles to change the coil set rate of curvature (and therefore the spring rate) for
various portions of the spring 124, without changing other physical parameters of the spring,
By changing the angle at which the metal is drawn across the anvil, the spring rate may be
made to increase continually or decrease continually from one end of the spring to the other, or
it may be made to increase from one end to an intermediate point, stay constant for a certain
length of the coil, and then decrease, or increase and then decrease, or to vary stepwise or in
any other desired pattern, depending upon the application for which it will be used. The coil set
radius of curvature of the spring may be manipulated as desired to create the desired spring
force at each point along the spring in order to result in the desired power assist torque curve
for any particular application.

                                                   -26
[0121]       The coil set radius of curvature in the prior art generally is either constant throughout
the length of the flat spring or continuously increases from the inner end 200 to the outer end
202, with the outer end 202 connected to the output spool of the spring motor. However, as
explained above, a flat spring may be engineered so that a portion of the flat spring that is
farther away from the end that is connected to the output spool may have a coil set with a
larger radius of curvature than a portion of the flat spring that is closer to the end that is
connected to the output spool, as is the case with the reverse wound spring shown in step #3
of Figure 19 and as is the case in many of the other engineered flat spring arrangements
described above, The coil set radius of curvature may have a third portion still farther away
from the end that is connected to the output spool that is smaller than the larger radius portion,
or it may remain constant from the larger radius portion to the other end, and so forth.
Additional embodiment of a drive motor with a pass-through feature
[0122]       Figures 21 and 22 depict a top down/ bottom up shade 1002', similar to the shade
1002 of Figures 6A and 6B, which uses two spring motors 102', one for each lift shaft 1022',
1024'. The shade 1002' includes a top rail 1004' with drive units 1006'B, 1006'M, a middle rail
1008'. a bottom rail 1012', a cellular shade structure 1016'. spring motors 102 M, 102'B, two
bottom rail lift stations 1020', two middle rail lift stations 1018', a bottom rail lift shaft 1022', a
middle rail lift shaft 1024', a middle rail drop-limiter 1025'M and a bottom rail drop limiter
1025'B. The lift stations 1020', 1018' and their operating principles are disclosed in U. S.
Patent No, 6,536,503 "Modular Transport System for Coverings for Architectural Openings",
issued March 25, 2003, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
[0123]       In the case of the top down/ bottom up shade 1002' of Figures 21 and 22, the spring
motors 102'M, 102'B, the lift stations 1018', 1020', the rail drop- limiters 1025'M, 1025'B1 the
drive units 1006'M, 1006'B, and the lift shafts 1022', 1024', are all housed in the top rail 1004'.
Both lift shafts 1022', 1024' pass completely through both of the spring motors 102'M,
102'B1 but each of the lift shafts 1022', 1024' engages only one of the spring motors and
passes through the other without engaging it, The middle rail lift shaft 1024' operatively
interconnects the two middle rail lift stations 1018', the spring motor 102'M, and the middle rail
1008' via lift cords 1032', but simply passes through the other spring motor 102'B. The bottom
rail lift shaft 1022' operatively interconnects the two bottom rail lift stations 1020', the spring
motor 102'B, and the bottom rail 1012' via lift cords 1030', but simply passes through the other
spring motor 102'M, as described later.

                                                 -27
[0124]      In this instance, the middle rail 1008' may travel all the way up until it is resting just
below the top rail 1004', or it may travel all the way down until it is resting just above the
bottom rail 1012', or the middle rail 1008' may remain anywhere in between these two extreme
positions. The bottom rail 1012' may travel all the way up until it is resting just below the middle
rail 1008' (regardless of where the middle rail 1008' is located at the time), or it may travel all
the way down until it is extending the full length of the shade 1002', or the bottom rail 1012'
may remain anywhere in between these two extreme positions.
[0125]      Each lift shaft 1022', 1024' operates independently of the other, using its respective
components, with the middle rail lift shaft 1024'operatively connected to the middle rail 1008',
and the bottom rail lift shaft 1022'operatively connected to the bottom rail 1012'. It should be
noted that the drive units 1006'M, 1006'B (described in detail later) depicted are cord drives
(with drive cords 1007') which incorporate a brake mechanism to prevent the shade from
moving (either creeping up or falling down) once the user releases the cord 1007'. The drop
limiters 1025'M, 1025'B (described in detail later) prevent the over-rotation of their respective
lift shafts 1024', 1022' once the shade has reached its fully extended position.
[0126]      The drop limiters 1025'M, 1025'B prevent the possibility of having the motors 102'M.
102'B unwind fully from the output spool onto the storage spool and then start winding back up
again onto the output spool in the opposite direction, which could happen if the user continues
to pull on the cord 1007' of the cord drive 1006'M, 1006'B in the same direction once the shade
is fully extended. The drop limiters 1025'M, 1025'B preclude this possibility by providing a
physical stop which does not permit the further rotation of their respective lift cords 1024',
1022', as described below.
[0127]      The drop limiters 1025'M, 1025'B are identical to each other and will be referred to
generically as 1025'. Referring to Figures 33 and 34, each drop limiter 1025' includes an
internally threaded base 204 which snaps into and is fixedly secured to the head rail 1004' to
prevent relative motion between the base 204 and the head rail 1004'. A hollow, externally
threaded rod 206 defines an internal profile 226 which closely matches the profile of the lift
shafts 1024', 1022' such that the rod 206 may slide axially along the longitudinal direction of its
corresponding lift shaft but is also rotationally driven by and rotates with its corresponding lift
shaft. The external threads 228 of the rod 206 engage the internal threads 230 of the base
204.

                                                -28
[0128]      The hollow rod 206 includes a flange 232 at one end, which defines a radially
directed and axially-extending shoulder 208, and the base 204 likewise defines an axially
extending shoulder 210 which acts as a stop to prevent the further rotation of the rod 206 when
the shoulder 208 on the hollow rod 206 contacts the shoulder 210 on the base 204, In
operation, the base 204 is snapped into the head rail 1004' and one of the lift shafts 1024',
1022' is routed through the hollow rod 206 of the drop limiter 1025'M or 1025'B. The hollow rod
206 is threaded into its respective base 204 to the desired position such that, when its
corresponding rail of the shade 1002' is in the fully extended position, the shoulder 208 of the
hollow rod 206 is abutting the shoulder 210 of the base 204, As the shade 1002' is raised, the
rotation of the corresponding lift shaft 1024' or 1022' drives the hollow rod 206, causing it to
rotate relative to its respective base 204, which causes the hollow rod to slide longitudinally (in
the axial direction) along its corresponding lift shaft 1024' or 1022', causing the shoulder 208 of
the hollow rod 206 to move away from the shoulder 210 on the base 204.
[0129]      When the action is reversed and the shade 1002' is lowered, the hollow rod 206 is
driven in the opposite rotational direction relative to the base 204 by its corresponding lift shaft
1024' or 1022', which causes it to slide longitudinally (in the axial direction) along its
corresponding lift shaft 1024' or 1022' until the shoulder 208 of the hollow rod 206 contacts the
shoulder 210 of the base 204 (when its corresponding lift shaft 1024' or 1022' reaches the fully
extended position). The abutting of the shoulder 208 of the hollow rod 206 against the shoulder
210 of the base 204 stops the rotation of the hollow rod 206, which, in turn, stops the rotation
of the corresponding lift shaft 1024' or 1022' that extends through the hollow rod 206, thus
preventing the over-rotation of the corresponding spring motor 102'M or 102'B or of the
corresponding drive 1006'M, 1006'B, which are operatively connected to their corresponding
lift shaft 1024' or 1022'.
[0130]      The spring motors 102'M, 102'B are identical to each other and will be referred to
generically as 102'. Referring now to Figures 23-27, the spring motor 102' includes a motor
output spool 122', a flat spring 124' (also referred to as a motor spring 124'), a storage spool
126', a motor housing 128", a housing cover 130', and a support plate 212', The motor housing
128' and the housing cover 130' snap together to form a complete housing.
[0131]      The motor output spool 122' (See also Figure 27) includes a spring take- up portion
132', which is flanked by beveled left and right shoulders 134", 136', respectively, and defines
a flat recess 138' including a raised button 140' (See Figure 26) for securing a first end 142' of
the flat spring 124' to the motor output spool 122', The first end 142' of the flat spring 124' is

                                                    -29
inserted into the flat recess 138' of the spring take-up portion 132' until the raised button 140'
of the spring take-up portion 132' snaps through the opening 144' at the first end 142' of the flat
spring 124', releasably securing the flat spring 124' to the motor output spool 122'.
[0132]      The motor output spool 122' further includes an extension portion 146' extending
axially to the right of the right shoulder 136'. In this embodiment the extension portion 146' is
only a straight shaft, but in a later embodiment (See Figure 29) the extension portion 146*
includes geared teeth as described later. Stub shafts 148', 150' extend axially from each end of
the motor output spool 122' for rotational support of the motor output spool 122' by the housing
128', as described later. As may also best be appreciated in Figure 26, the output spool 122'
has a hollow core defining a through-opening 214' with an internal profile which includes a "V"
projection 216' to closely match the profile of one of the lift shafts 1022', 1024' (which are
identical to each other). As best appreciated in Figures 22 and 27, one of the lift shafts goes
through this opening 214' of the spring motor 102'B, for driving engagement between the lift
shaft 1022' and the output spool 122'. In Figure 25, the lift shaft going through the output spool
122' is labeled 1022', which is the case for the spring motor 102'B of Figures 21 and 22.
[0133]      The flat spring 124' is a flat strip of metal which has been wound tightly upon itself,
as has already been described with respect to an earlier embodiment (See Figure 2), As
discussed above, a first end 142' of the spring 124' defines a through opening 144' for
releasably securing the flat spring 124' to the motor output spool 122'. The routing of the flat
spring 124', as seen from the vantage point of Figure 24, is for the first end 142' of the flat
spring 124' to go into the flat 138' until the button 140' snaps into the through opening 144' of
the flat spring 124\ The storage spool 126' is a substantially cylindrical hollow element defining
a through-opening 218' for pass-through accommodation of a lift shaft, such as the lift shaft
1024' as shown in Figures 22 and 25 (corresponding to the spring motor 102'B). The lift shaft
1024' does not engage the storage spool 126', but rather goes through the storage spool 126'
and may be rotationally supported by the storage spool 126', Of course, another shaft, such as
a tilt shaft for instance, may be routed to go through the opening 218' of the storage spool 126'
instead of the lift shaft 1024". The storage spool 126' is rotatably supported by the housing
128', 130' of the spring motor 102' for rotation relative to the housing 128'. 130'.
[0134]      A support plate 212' defines a through-opening 222' to receive and rotatably support
the storage spool 126' at a point intermediate the ends of the storage spool 126'. The storage
spool 126' has a slightly larger diameter at a shoulder 220', which is larger than the diameter of
the through opening 222' in the support plate 212', and which aids in locating the support plate

                                                  -  30
212' along the storage spool 126' during assembly by abutting the flat surface of the support
plate 212', The support plate 212' not only rotatably supports the storage spool 126' to limit
flexing of the storage spool 126' during operation, but it also serves to provide a guide to the
spring 124' as it comes off of the output spool 122' and onto the storage spool 126',
Operation
[0135]       The shade 1002' (See Figure 22) is assembled as disclosed above, with one of the
spring motors 102'B mounted in the orientation shown in Figures 23, 25, and 27 (with the lift
shaft 1022' passing through and rotationally engaging the output spool 122', and the lift shaft
1024' simply passing through the storage spool 126'). The other of the spring motors 102'M is
mounted in an orientation which is flipped over 180 degrees end-over-end from that of the first
spring motor 102'B (with the lift shaft 1024' passing through and rotationally engaging the
output spool 122', and the lift shaft 1022' simply passing through the storage spool 126'), This
pass-through arrangement of both the output spool 122' and the storage spool 126', with the
output spools 122', being rotationally engaged by their respective lift shafts, and with the
storage spools 126' not rotationally engaging the lift shafts that pass through them, allows for a
very compact installation within the head rail 1004' of the shade 1002', Not only can a large
number of these components be mounted anywhere along the length of the head rail, since the
shafts can pass completely through them (that is, they do not necessarily need to be mounted
at one of the ends of the head rail), but the lift shafts can be placed in a parallel orientation
very close to each other, allowing the use of a much narrower head rail than would otherwise
be possible.
[0136]       The lift shaft 1022' for the bottom rail 1012' is routed through the output spooll22' of
the spring motor 102'B, through the bottom lift stations 1020', through the bottom rail drop
limiter 1025'B, and into the cord drive 1006'B, This bottom rail lift shaft 1022' also goes through
(but does not engage) the storage spool 126' of the spring motor 102'M. Likewise, the middle
rail lift shaft 1024' is routed through the output spool122* of the spring motor 102'M, through
the middle lift stations 1018", through the middle rail drop limiter 1025'M, and into the cord
drive 1006'M. This middle rail lift shaft 1024' also goes through (but does not engage) the
storage spool 126' of the spring motor 102'B.
[0137]       To raise or lower either one of the rails, 1008', 1012', its corresponding cord drive
1006'B or 1006'M is operated by the user by pulling on one of the two legs of the respective
drive cord 1007', If the cord drive 1006'B on the far left side of the shade 1002' (as seen in
Figure 22) is operated by the user in the direction to lower the shade 1002', overcoming the

                                                   -31
brake mechanism in the cord drive 1006'B, then the bottom rail lift shaft 1022' will rotate,
causing rotation of the output spool 122' of the bottom rail spring motor 102'B in a clockwise
direction (as seen from the vantage point of Figure 24), which in turn causes the respective
spring 124' to unwind from the output spool 122' and to wind onto the storage spool 126'. The
spools on the bottom rail lift stations 1020' also rotate to lengthen the lift cables 1030' so as to
lower the bottom rail 1012'. When the bottom rail 1012' reaches its full extension, the shoulder
208 on the rod 206 of the drop limiter 1025'B contacts the shoulder 210 on its respective base
204, which stops further rotation of the bottom rail lift shaft 1022'. Reversing the direction in
which the bottom rail cord drive 1006'B is operated also reverses the direction of rotation of the
bottom rail lift shaft 1022', resulting in the raising of the bottom rail 1012'
[0138]      Actuation of the middle rail cord drive 1006'M at the right end of the shade 1002'
results in a similar lowering or raising of the middle rail 1008', depending on the direction in
which the drive cord 1007' of the cord drive 1006'M is pulled.
Drive motor with a pass-through feature for a tilt shaft
[0139]      Figure 22A depicts another application for the spring motor 102' described above,
used in an application for a drive for a blind, wherein the blind includes lift and tilt stations 500A
operatively connected via a lift shaft 118 and a tilt shaft 119, as described in more detail below.
[0140]      The lift and tilt stations 500A are described in detail in U. S. Patent 6,536,503 titled
"Modular Transport Systems for Architectural Openings" issued March 25, 2003, which is
hereby incorporated by reference (refer specifically to item 500A in Figures 132, 133, 133A.
134, 1325, and 172). Very briefly, the lift and tilt station 500A includes a lift spool 234 onto
which lift cords (not shown) wrap or unwrap to raise or lower the blind, This lift spool 234 is
rotated along its longitudinal axis by the rotation of the lift shaft 118. The lift and tilt station
500A also includes a tilt pulley 236 onto which tilt cables (not shown) wrap or unwrap to tilt the
blinds from closed in one direction (say room side up), to open, to closed in the other direction
(room side down). The tilt pulley 236 is rotated by the rotation of the tilt shaft 119.
[0141]      The cord tiller control module 1009 has been fully described in Canadian Patent No,
2,206,932 "Anderson", dated December 4, 1997 (1997/12/04), which is hereby incorporated by
reference. Pulling on tilt cords (not shown) on the cord tilter module 1009 causes rotation of
the tilt shaft 119, which then also causes rotation of the tilt pulley 236 of the lift and tilt stations
500A, to wrap or unwrap the tilt cables (not shown) to tilt the blinds.

                                                    - 32
[0142]      The output spool 122' of the spring motor 102' is operatively connected to the lift and
tilt stations 500A via the lift shaft 118. The tilt shaft 119 passes through the storage spool 126'
of the spring motor 102' but is not engaged by the spring motor 102'. This arrangement allows
for the installation of a lift shaft 118 and a tilt shaft 119 in very close proximity to each other;
that is, in a narrower head rail than would otherwise be possible.
Drive motor with a pass-through feature and an integrally mounted transmission
[0143]      All else being equal, the shade 1002' of Figure 21 is limited in how long the cellular
shade structure 1016' can be (or how far down the bottom rail 1012' can extend) by the
number of turns the lift shaft 1022' can rotate before the spring 124' of the spring motor 102' is
fully unwound from the output spool 122'. Figures 28-32 depict another embodiment of a spring
motor 102*, which is similar to the spring motor 102', except that it has an integral transmission
to partially overcome this limitation. As discussed in more detail below, the gear ratio of the
meshing gears in the output spool 122* and in the storage spool 126* of this spring motor 102*
may be selected to result in the desired increase in number of turns of the lift shaft, albeit at
the expense of reduced torque.
[0144]       Referring to Figures 28-32, the spring motor 102* is very similar to the spring motor
102' of Figures 23-27, including an output spool 122*. a flat spring 124*, a storage spool 126*.
a motor housing 128*, a housing cover 130*. and a support plate 212". The significant
differences include a spur gear extension 146* on the output spool 122* to replace what was a
straight shaft extension146\ and a meshing spur gear extension 224* on the storage spool
126* to the right of what was the shoulder 220' of the spring motor 102'. (While these gears
mesh directly with each other, it is understood that there could be intermediate gears if
desired. Also, the gear 224* could be directly connected to the shaft that extends through the
storage spool instead of being on the storage spool, in which case the storage spool 126*
need not rotate with the shaft that passes through it and could instead be stationary or free
floating.)
[0145]       Referring now to Figure 31 and comparing it with Figure 26 of the previous
embodiment, it should be noted that the hollow core 214* now has a round internal profile,
without the "V" projection which had been used to engage the lift shaft 1022". Therefore, the
output spool 122* now becomes a pass-through only spool which does not rotatably engage
the lift shaft extending through it. On the other hand, the hollow core 218* of the storage spool
126* now has an internal profile which includes a "V" projection 216* to rotatably engage the
lift shaft 1024' passing through this storage spool 126*. With this arrangement, the spur gear

                                                  - 33
extension 146" rotates with the output spool 122*, and it drives the storage spool gear 224*.
which, in turn, drives the lift shaft 1024' that is extending through the storage spool 124*. The
lift shaft 1022' extending through the drive spool 122* is just a pass-through, and is not driven
by the spring motor 102*.
[0146]      The installation of this spring motor 102* is very similar to that of the spring motor
102' of Figure 22, except that one lift shaft is now passing through and rotatably engaging the
storage spool 126*. while the other lift shaft is only passing through the output spool 122*.
Therefore, where the bottom rail spring motor 102'B was located, one would now install the
middle rail spring motor 102*M because this spring motor 102*M would now be engaging the
middle rail lift shaft 1024' via its storage spool 126*, Likewise, where the middle rail spring
motor 102'M was located, one would now install the bottom rail spring motor 102*B because
this spring motor 102*B would now be engaging the bottom rail lift shaft 1022' via its storage
spool 126*.
[0147]      The gear ratio of the spur gear 146* (on the output spool 122*) and the spur gear
224* (on the storage spool 126*) may be selected to provide additional turns of the storage
spool 126* (and therefore of the lift shaft which is rotationally engaged by the storage spool
126') to extend the length of the shade which may be handled by the spring motor 102* as
compared to an otherwise identically sized spring motor 102'.
Double limiter
[0148]      Figure 22B is very similar to Figure 22 in that it depicts a top down, bottom up shade
with substantially all the same components such as cord drives 1006', spring motors 102', lift
stations 1018', 1020', lift shafts 1022', 1024', middle rail 1008' (also referred to as intermediate
rail), and bottom rail 1012'. However, the two individual drop limiters 1025' have been replaced
by a dual limiter 1040 which serves the same function as the individual drop limiters 1025', plus
additional functions as described below.
[0149]      The double limiter 1040 is more than just a drop limiter in that it not only limits the
lowering (or drop) of the bottom rail 1012' to its fully extended position; it also limits the drop of
the middle rail 1008' to the point where the middle rail 1008' meets the bottom rail 1012', no
matter where the bottom rail 1012' is at the time. This prevents the middle rail lift stations 1010'
from continuing to rotate and the corresponding middle rail lift cords 1032* from continuing to
unwind from the middle rail lift stations 1010' when the middle rail 1008' has nowhere to go
(which would cause slack to develop in these lift cords 1032'). Likewise, the double limiter

                                                 - 34
1040 limits the raising of the bottom rail 1012' to the point where the bottom rail 1012' meets
the middle rail 1008'. no matter where the middle rail 1008' is at the time. This prevents the
bottom rail 1012'from continuing to be raised and raising the middle rail 1008' with it, which
would again cause slack to develop in the middle rail lift cords 1032',
[0150]      With the double limiter 1040, in order to raise the bottom rail 1012' beyond the
current location of the middle rail 1008', the middle rail 1008' must first be raised beyond that
point. Likewise, if the middle rail 1008' is to be lowered beyond the current location of the
bottom rail 1012', the bottom rail 1012' must first be lowered beyond that point,
[0151]      As explained in more detail below, the double limiter 1040 is similar to having two of
the individual drop limiters 1025* described earlier in a parallel orientation wherein the flanges
of the two drop limiters may interfere with each other. Referring to Figures 64-71. the double
limiter 1040 includes a base 1042 defining two internally-threaded semi-cylindrical surfaces
1044, 1046. The axes 1048, 1046 of these semi-cylindrical surfaces 1044, 1046 are
substantially parallel (See Figure 69). The semi-cylindrical surfaces 1044, 1046 lie on opposite
ends of the base 1042, Each semi-cylindrical surface 1044, 1046 defines a proximal end which
is closer to the center of the base 1042 and a distal end, which projects away from the base
1042. A respective pair of unthreaded arms 1052. 1054 projects beyond each of the semi
cylindrical surfaces 1044. 1046 and supports a respective arched cap 1056, 1058,
[0152]      The base 1042 also defines through openings 1060, 1062 spaced away from the
respective semi-cylindrical threaded surfaces 1044, 1046, which provide support for their
respective shafts 1022', 1024', as described in more detail later, A substantially vertical post
1064 with a substantially horizontal (linger 1066 projects from the base 1042 at a location
between the axes 1048. 1050 and at one end of the rectangular frame 1043 of the base 1042,
The finger 1066 extends from the upper end of the post 1064 and projects toward the center of
the base 1042. As explained in more detail below, the post 1064 serves as a stop for the
bottom rail limiter, and the finger 1066 serves as a "keeper" to prevent the accidental
disassembly of the double limiter 1040 during initial installation and shipment.
[0153]      The double limiter 1040 further includes two nearly identical rail-limiter control rods
1068, 1070. The first rail-limiter control rod 1068 is shown in more detail in Figures 70 and 71.
It is a hollow, externally threaded rod defining a non-cylindrical internal cross-section 1072
which closely matches the cross- section of the lift shaft 1022' (See Figure 22B) for the bottom
rail 1012'. As described in more detail later, once assembled, with the lift shaft 1022' extending

                                                  - 35
through the first rail-limiter control tube 1068, the lift shaft 1022' and control tube 1068 rotate
together, and the first control tube 1068 slides axially along the lift shaft 1022' as the first
control tube 1068 threads (or un-threads) itself from its corresponding semi-cylindrical surface
1044.
[0154]      The first control tube 1068, for limiting the bottom rail, includes a flange 1074 at one
end, which defines two radially-directed and axially-extending shoulders 1076, 1078, with the
inner shoulder 1076 projecting from the inner surface of the flange 1074 and the outer
shoulder 1078 projecting from the outer surface of the flange 1074. As described earlier, the
post 1064 of the base 1042 also defines a shoulder which acts as a stop to prevent the further
rotation of the bottom-rail lift shaft 1022* when the shoulder 1076 on the bottom rail control
tube 1068 contacts the post 1064 on the base 1042.
[0155]      The second control tube 1070, for limiting the middle rail, is nearly identical to the
first control tube 1068, with the main difference being that the first control tube 1068 has a right
hand thread, while the second control tube 1070 has a left-hand thread, In order to help ensure
that the control tubes 1068, 1070 are installed in their proper positions, the first control tube
1068 has a smaller diameter (3/8-32 right hand thread) than the second control tube 1070 (7/8
32 left hand thread), Of course, the corresponding threaded surfaces 1044, 1046 on the base
1042 have corresponding, mating diameters and threads in order to receive their respective
control tubes.
[0156]      As with the first control tube 1068, the second control tube 1070 has a flange 1080 at
one end, which defines a radially-directed and axially-extending shoulder 1082 projecting from
its outer surface (See Figure 65). The second control tube 1070 also has a non-cylindrical
internal cross-section which engages its corresponding non-cylindrical outer cross-section
middle rail lift shaft 1024' (See Figure 22B). Once assembled, with the middle rail lift shaft
1024' extending through the second control tube 1070, the middle rail lift shaft 1024' and
second control tube 1070 rotate together, and the second control tube 1070 slides axially
along the middle rail lift shaft 1024' as the second control tube 1070 threads (or un-threads)
itself from its corresponding semi- cylindrical surface 1046,
Assembly and Operation of the Double Limiter
[0157]      To assemble the double limiter 1040, the first control tube 1068 is oriented with its
flange above the rectangular frame 1043 of the base 1042 and its threaded end directed
toward the semi-cylindrical threaded surface 1044. Since the first control tube 1068 is too long

                                                - 36
to fit completely inside the rectangular frame 1043 of the base 1042, it is oriented at
approximately a 45 degree angle to the axis 1048, and the threaded end is inserted into the
open space below the arched cap 1056 until the first control tube 1068 can be pivoted
downwardly so that its longitudinal axis is coaxial with the axis 1048 of the first semi-cylindrical
threaded surface 1044, with its flange 1074 inside the rectangular frame 1043 of the base
1042. The first control tube 1068 is then threaded into the first semi-cylindrical threaded
surface 1044 until the inner shoulder 1076 of the flange 1074 abuts the post 1064, which stops
the rotation of the first control tube 1068. Next the second control tube 1070 is inserted into its
respective position on the base 1042 in substantially the same manner, threading the second
control tube 1070 into its semi-cylindrical threaded surface 1046 until its flange 1080 abuts the
wall 1045 of the rectangular frame 1043 of the base 1042, with the longitudinal axis of the
second control tube 1070 coaxial with the second axis 1050 of the base 1042, The second
control tube 1070 is then partially un-threaded from its semi-cylindrical surface 1046 until its
outer shoulder 1082 abuts the outer shoulder 1078 of the flange 1074 of the first control tube
1068, as shown in Figure 64.
[0158]      The assembled double limiter 1040 is then mounted onto the top rail (not shown) as
depicted in Figure 22B. and the bottom and middle lift shafts 1022', 1024' are then inserted
through their corresponding first and second control tubes 1068, 1070 and through the
corresponding through openings 1060, 1062 in the base 1042. Note that the base 1042 rests
in the top rail, and ears 1084 (See Figure 69) on each corner of the base 1042 engage the top
rail and serve to secure or "lock" the base 1042 onto the top rail.
[0159]      Figure 64 depicts the position of the double limiter 1040 when the bottom rail 1012' is
in the fully extended position and the middle rail 1008' is in the fully lowered position, resting
atop the bottom rail 1012'. Note that, in this position, the finger 1066 of the post 1064 is directly
above both flanges 1074, 1080 of the first and second control tubes 1068, 1070, helping to
prevent them from lifting up. out of the base 1042. The bottom and middle lift shafts 1022',
1024' extend through the respective first and second control tubes 1068, 1070 and through the
openings 1060, 1062 in the base 1042, Thus, both of the rail- limiter control tubes 1068, 1070
are secured to the base 1042 at both ends.
[0160]      Figure 65 depicts the position of the double limiter 1040 when the bottom rail 1012' is
halfway between its fully extended position and its fully retracted position, and the middle rail
1008' is resting atop the bottom rail 1012'. Figure 67 is a plan view of this same condition. In
this position, the outer shoulders 1078, 1082 of the first and second flanges 1074, 1080 abut

                                                  - 37
each other, preventing the first lift shaft 1022' which lifts the bottom rail 1012' from being
rotated to raise the bottom rail any further. When the control tubes are in this position, the
abutting outer shoulders 1078, 1082 also prevent the second lift shaft 1024'from being rotated
to lower the middle rail 1008' any further. This effectively prevents a slack condition of the
middle rail lift cords 1032.
[0161]     Figure 66 depicts the position of the double limiter 1040 when both the bottom rail
1012' and the middle rail 1008 are fully retracted.
[0162]     Figure 68 depicts the position of the double limiter 1040 corresponding to the
position of the shade 1003' in Figure 22B, wherein the bottom rail 1012' is partially extended
and the middle rail 1008' is part-way between the head rail and the bottom rail 1012-. In this
position, the flanges 1074, 1080 do not interfere with each other. The first lift shaft 1022' may
be rotated in one direction to lower the bottom rail 1012' until it is fully lowered {until the
shoulder 1076 abuts the post 1064 (which is also a shoulder) to stop further lowering of the
bottom rail 1012'), and the first lift shaft 1022' may be rotated in the opposite direction to raise
the bottom rail 1012' until it reaches the middle rail 1008'(when the outer shoulder 1082 of the
second control tube 1070 abuts the outer shoulder 1078 of the first control tube 1068),
[0163]     Likewise, from the position of Figure 68, the second lift shaft 1024' may be rotated in
one direction to raise the middle rail 1008' until the middle rail is fully raised (fully retracted), at
which point the flange 1080 of the middle-rail limiter control tube 1070 abuts the wall 1045, and
it may be rotated in the opposite direction to lower the middle rail until it reaches the bottom rail
1012' (when the outer shoulder 1082 of the middle-rail limiter control tube 1070 abuts the outer
shoulder 1078 of the bottom-rail limiter control tube 1068).
Drive motor for simultaneous lift / tilt action
[0164]     Figures 35 and 36 depict another embodiment of a spring motor 102** (in these
views the housing and the flat spring are omitted for clarity) used in an application wherein the
raising and lowering action of the covering (such as a blind or shade) is also used to tilt the
slats open or closed, as discussed in more detail below.
[0165]     The spring motor 102** is operatively connected to a lift and tilt station 500A via a lift
shaft 118 and a tilt shaft 119. The lift and tilt station 500A is described in detail in U. S. Patent
6,536,503 titled "Modular Transport Systems for Architectural Openings" issued March 25,
2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference (refer specifically to item 500A in Figures 132,

                                                    - 38
133, 133A, 134, 1325, and 172). Very briefly, the lift and tilt station 500A includes a lift spool
234 onto which lift cords (not shown) wrap or unwrap to raise or lower the shade. This lift spool
234 is rotated about its longitudinal axis by the rotation of the lift shaft 118. The lift and tilt
station 500A also includes a tilt pulley 236 onto which tilt cables (not shown) wrap or unwrap to
tilt the blinds from closed in one direction (say room side up), to open, to closed in the other
direction (room side down). The tilt pulley 236 is rotated by the rotation of the tilt shaft 119.
[0166]       The spring motor 102** includes a drive gear 146** mounted for rotation with the
output spool 122**, and a driven gear 224** mounted for rotation with the storage spool 126**,
As best appreciated in Figure 35, the drive gear 146** includes a full set of geared teeth 238
on its circumference. On the other hand, the driven gear 224** includes geared teeth 240 on
most of its circumference, with a portion 241 of the circumference having no gear teeth, As
may be best appreciated in Figure 36, both the storage spool 126** and the output spool 122**
have hollow inner cores 414**, 416** respectively, which define non-cylindrical profiles in order
to rotationally drive their corresponding shafts 119, 118.
Operation of the Drive motor for simultaneous lift / tilt action
[0167]       When a window blind incorporating the spring motor 102** and lift and tilt stations
500A is operated by the user (for instance to lower the blind by pulling on the drive cord 1007'
(See Figure 21) of a cord drive mechanism 1006'), the lift shaft 118 will rotate, which also
rotates the output spool 122**. the drive gear 146**, and the lift spool 234 of the lift and tilt
station 500A. The lift cords (not shown) unwrap from the lift spool 234, lowering the blind. The
drive gear 146" also drives the driven gear 224"*as long as the geared teeth 238 of the drive
gear 146" are engaging the geared teeth 240 of the driven gear 224*", resulting in rotation of
the tilt pulley 236 of the lift and tilt station 500A, which causes the blind slats to tilt closed in
one direction (say room side up),
[0168]       When the blind is closed in this room side up direction the driven gear 224** will
have rotated far enough to present its toothless portion 241 of the driven gear 224** to the
drive gear 146**, such that further rotation of the drive gear 146** results in no further rotation
of the driven gear 224** and therefore also no further rotation of the tilt pulley 236 and no
further closing of the blind, even though the blind continues to be lowered by the user, Once
the user has lowered the blind to the desired location he may reverse the action and raise the
blind slightly. This reverses the direction of rotation of the drive gear 146** which then brings
the geared teeth portion 240 of the driven gear 224** back into meshed engagement with the
drive gear 146**. causing the driven gear 224** to rotate together with the tilt pulley 236,

                                                  - 39
resulting in tilting the slats into the open position, The user may release the blind when the
desired degree of tilting of the blind is reached.
[0169]      Of course, if the blind is not raised at all after lowering, the blind will remain tilted
closed (room side up in this example), Further raising of the blind results in further tilting of the
blind through the open position, until the blind reaches a closed position in the opposite
direction (room side down in this example). At this point, the driven gear 224** will once again
have rotated far enough to present its toothless portion 241 to the drive gear 146** such that
further rotation of the drive gear 146** results in no further rotation of the driven gear 224** and
therefore also no further rotation of the tilt pulley 236 and no further tilting closed of the blind,
even though the blind continues to be raised by the user.
Cord drive with clutch mechanism
[0170]      The cord drive with clutch mechanisms 1006'B and 1006'M of Figures 21 and 22 are
identical to each other and are depicted generically as 1006' in Figures 37-40. As indicated
earlier, this cord drive 1006' may be used to raise or lower a blind or shade (or other window
covering). It may also be used to tilt open or closed a window covering either by directly
actuating a tilt shaft connected to a tilt station or by doing so indirectly via a lift shaft, as is
described in the above embodiment of a drive motor for simultaneous lift / tilt action, This cord
drive 1006' also incorporates a clutch mechanism (also referred to as a brake mechanism) to
ensure that only the input shaft may drive the output shaft (and do so in either direction of
rotation), but the output shaft may not back-drive the input shaft, as described below. That is,
the cord drive 1006' provides substantial restriction to rotation of the shaft (whether a lift shaft
or a tilt shaft) when the shaft is not being driven by the cord drive 1006', while substantially
easing the rotation of the shaft when the shaft is being driven by the cord drive.
[0171]      Therefore, once the covering is extended or retracted (or tilted open or closed) to the
desired location by the user and released, the covering remains in that location regardless of
the weight of the covering and regardless of whether the mechanism assisting the operation of
the covering is underpowered (which would otherwise allow the weight of the covering to
extend the covering) or overpowered (which would otherwise allow the covering to creep
upward).
[0172]      Referring to Figure 40, the cord drive with clutch mechanism 1006' includes a
housing cover 300, a sprocket 302, a housing 304, a roller 306, an input shaft 308 (also
referred to as an actuator side shaft 308), an assembly screw 310, a spring 312, an output

                                                 -40
shaft 314 (also referred to as a load side shaft 314), a brake housing 316, a collet 318 (or
coupling device 318 to secure a shaft, such as the lift shaft 1024' in Figure 22, to the output
shaft 314), and a runnerless screw 320 to secure the housing 304 to a rail, such as the head
rail 1004'.
[0173]      Referring to Figures 38, 39, 40, and 42, the sprocket 302 includes a pulley 322
defining a plurality of circumferentially-placed, staggered, and alternating wedges 324 which
both guide and releasably engage the drive cord 1007' (See Figure 22) such that pulling on
one leg of the drive cord 1007' rotates the sprocket 302 relative to a bearing support 326 (See
Figure 40) in the housing 304 in a first direction, and pulling on the other leg of the drive cord
1007' rotates the sprocket 302 in the opposite direction. The sprocket 302 also defines an
axially extending shaft with a first, proximal shaft portion 328 with a circular cross-section for
rotation on the bearing support 326 of the housing 304, and a second, distal shaft portion 330
with a non-circular cross-section which matches a similarly profiled cavity 332 (See Figure 40)
in the input shaft 308. When assembled, the distal shaft portion 330 of the sprocket 302 is
received in the cavity 332 of the input shaft 308, such that rotation of the sprocket 302 results
in rotation of the input shaft 308.
[0174]      Due to a recessed inner hub 334 of the sprocket 302, the proximal shaft portion 328
of the sprocket 302 is directly in line with the drive cord 1007' (the dotted arrow 350 in Figure
38, which represents where the drive cord 1007' rides on the sprocket 302, shows how the
drive cord 1007' is directly in line with the proximal shaft portion 328). Therefore, when the
operator pulls on the drive cord 1007', the sprocket 302 is supported immediately under the
cord, not cantilevered out. This means that there is no lever arm to place a bending moment
on the sprocket shaft 328.
[0175]      In other words, the sprocket 302 has an axis of rotation which is the same as the
longitudinal axis of the assembly screw 310 in Figure 38. The drive cord 1007' wraps around
the sprocket 302 along a plane that is substantially perpendicular to this axis of rotation of the
sprocket 302. That plane is denoted by the dotted arrow 350. The bearing surface 326
supports the sprocket 302 for rotation, and at least a portion of that bearing surface 326 lies in
that plane 350,
[0176]      The distal shaft portion 330 of the sprocket 302 is received in a cavity 332 of the
input shaft 308 which allows for the sprocket 302 to have a smaller journal than that found in
prior art designs wherein the input shaft 308 fits into a cavity in the sprocket shaft. This

                                                 -41
"smaller journal" feature results in a more efficient design with smoother operation because the
smaller surface area results in lower friction of rotation, and the smaller diameter results in a
larger lever arm between the drive cord 1007' and the sprocket's shaft 330, which makes the
covering easier to lift.
[0177]      Referring to Figures 38, 39, 40, and 43, the input shaft 308 includes a radially
extending flange 336 with a circular hub 348 which, as described earlier, defines the non
circular cross-section cavity 332 that receives the distal shaft portion 330 of the sprocket 302.
It also includes an arc-segment wall 338 extending axially from the circumference of the flange
336. This arc-segment wall 338 defines two shoulders 340, 342 which, when rotated,
alternately contact inwardly-projecting ends 344, 346 of the spring 312, respectively (See also
Figures 46-48), to collapse the coil of the spring 312 and release the braking force when the
drive cord 1007' is pulled, as explained in more detail later. The circular hub 348 of the input
shaft 308 also is received inside of and provides a bearing surface for the rotational support of
the output shaft 314, as also described in more detail later.
[0178]      Referring to Figures 38, 39, 40, and 46-48, the coil spring 312 has a first end 344
and a second end 346, both of which project inwardly from the coil, The spring 312 defines an
"at rest" coil outside diameter when no outside forces are acting on the spring 312, and this
coil outside diameter collapses (becomes smaller) when a force acts on one or both of the
ends 344, 346 in a direction to tighten (or wind up) the coil. Likewise, the coil expands
(becomes larger) when a force acts on one or both of the ends 344, 346 in the opposite
direction, that is, in the direction so as to unwind the coil. When assembled, the shoulders 340,
342 of the input shaft 308 lie adjacent to the ends 344, 346 (See Figure 46) of the spring 312,
such that rotation of the input shaft 308 brings one of the shoulders 340, 342 against its
corresponding spring end 344, 346 in a direction to collapse the spring 312.
[0179]      Referring to Figures 38, 39, 40, and 44, the output shaft 314 includes a radially
extending flange 352 which defines a first hub 354 projecting in the "actuator side" direction,
and a second hub 356 projecting in the "load side" direction, The first hub 354 defines a
circularly-profiled inner cavity 358 which receives and is supported for rotation on the circular
hub 348 of the input shaft 308. This first hub 354 further defines first and second shoulders
360, 362 are adjacent to the inwardly-projecting ends 344, 346 of the spring 312, respectively
(See also Figures 46-48). When assembled, the shoulders 360, 362 of the output shaft 314 are
arranged such that when one or the other shoulder 360, 362 of the output shaft 314 presses
against one of the ends 344, 346 of the spring 312, it acts to expand the spring 312.

                                                - 42
[0180]     Referring to Figure 44, the second hub 356 has a non-circularly profiled cavity 364
(with a V-shaped projection) for receiving the similarly profiled lift shaft 1022' or 1024 such that
rotation of the output shaft 314 results in rotation of the lift shaft that extends into the second
hub 356. The second hub 356 also defines a radially directed opening 366 to receive a collet
screw 368 (See Figure 40) for ensuring a tight connection between the output shaft 314 and its
corresponding lift shaft.
[0181]     Referring to Figures 38, 39, 40, and 45, the clutch housing 316 is a substantially
hollow cylinder with a large opening at one end defining a circularly-profiled cavity 370 with an
inside diameter which is just slightly smaller than the at-rest outside diameter of the coil of the
spring 312. The other end of the clutch housing 316 has a smaller opening 372 which receives
and provides rotational support to the second hub 356 of the output shaft 314. The clutch
housing 316 also defines two tabs 378, 380 (See also Figure 39) which engage rectangular
openings 382 (See also Figure 41) in the housing 304 to snap these two parts 316, 304
together and fix the clutch housing 316 to the housing 304. Since the housing 304 is fixed to
the headrail, both the housing 304 and the clutch housing 316 are stationary relative to the
headrail.
[0182]     Referring to Figures 38, 39, and 40, the collet 318 is a substantially "U"- shaped
hollow cylinder with a through opening 374 that is axially-aligned with the opening 372 in the
housing 316 to receive a shaft (such as a lift shaft). Part of the opening 374 has a slightly
larger inside diameter, allowing it to slip over the second hub 356 of the output shaft 314, and
the end portion of the opening 374 has a smaller inside diameter, si it abuts the end of the
second hub 356 of the output shaft 314. The collet 318 defines a radially-directed, threaded
portion 376 which receives the collet screw 368. As described earlier, when assembled, the
collet screw 368 projects through the radially- directed opening 366 in the output shaft 314 to
secure the collet 318 to the output shaft 314, and to press against the shaft to more securely
connect the shaft to the cord drive 1006'.
[0183]     Referring to Figures 39, 40, and 41, the housing 304 also defines webs 384, 386 to
effectively trap a leg of an extrusion, such as of the extrusion which forms the head rail 1004'.
The runnerless screw 320 is then threaded through an opening 388 in the housing (See Figure
41). This screw 320 "bites' into the side of the leg of the extrusion, which is trapped in the slit
opening 390 of Figure 39 and unable to move away because of the backing provided by the
web 384, to secure the housing 304 (and therefore the cord drive 1006') to the head rail 1004'.

                                                 -43
[0184]      Referring to Figures 40 and 49-52 the roller 306 is rotatably supported on a
substantially cylindrical projection 392 on the housing 304. The projection 392 defines a very
slight flange or Hp 394 (See Figure 52) at its distal end to releasably "capture" the roller 306
once it has been assembled onto the projection 392. The roller 306 is counterbored at both
ends 396, 398 (See Figure 50) which eases assembly of the roller 306 to the projection 392
and prevents binding of the roller 306 on the radiused corner 400 of the projection 392 at the
housing 304.
Assembly and operation of the cord drive
[0185]      Most of the assembly of the cord drive 1006' has already been discussed in the
above description of the components. Very briefly, and referring to Figures 40 and 46-48, the
drive cord is first attached to the sprocket 302 by weaving the drive cord onto the pulley 322
and between the alternating wedges 324 of the sprocket 302, The roller 306 may be mounted
onto the projection 392 of the housing 302 at any time. The sprocket 302 is then mounted to
the housing 304, with the proximal shaft portion 328 rotatably supported on the bearing
support 326. The cord is routed over the roller 306 so the roller 306 guides and supports the
cord onto the sprocket 302. The input shaft 308 is mounted to the distal shaft portion 330 of
the sprocket 302, as has already been described, and the assembly screw 310 is used to
secure the input shaft 308 to the sprocket 302, as shown in Figures 38 and 39. The spring 312
is mounted over the hub 348 and over the wall 338 of the input shaft 308 such that the
shoulders 340, 342 of the wall 338 are adjacent to the ends 344, 346 of the spring 312 (See
Figure 46) and such that, if the input shaft 308 rotates, one of the shoulders 340, 342 contacts
one of the ends 344, 346 of the spring 312 so as to collapse the spring 312 to effectively
reduce the inside and outside diameters of the spring 312.
[0186]     The output shaft 314 is next assembled so its inner cavity 358 is rotatably supported
on the hub 348 of the input shaft 308 and such that the shoulders 360, 362 lie adjacent to the
ends 344, 346 of the spring 312 (See Figure 46) and such that, if the output shaft 314 rotates,
one of the shoulders 360, 362 contacts one of the ends 344, 346 of the spring 312 so as to
expand the spring 312 to effectively increase the inside and outside diameters of the coil,
[0187]     The clutch housing 316 is mounted such that the spring 312 is in the cavity 370 (it
may be necessary to rotate the sprocket 302 which also rotates the input shaft 308 so as to
collapse the spring 312 in order to fit the clutch housing 316 over the spring 312). The tabs
378, 380 of the clutch housing 316 are snapped into the openings 382 in the housing 304, and

                                                - 44
the collet 318 is mounted onto the second hub 356 of the output shaft 314, with the collet
screw 368 projecting through the opening 366 in the second hub 356 of the output shaft 314,
[0188]      The tabs 378, 380 which attach the clutch housing 316 to the housing 304 prevent
relative motion between the clutch housing 316 and the housing 304. If the housing 304 is
secured to the head rail (as discussed below) and the clutch housing 316 is secured to the
housing 304 (as discussed above) then the clutch housing 316 is effectively secured to the
head rail, with no relative motion allowed between these three parts (the housing 304, the
clutch housing 316, and the head rail 1004').
[0189]      To mount the cord drive 1006' to a window covering, the housing 304 is placed at
one end of the head rail 1004' (See Figure 21) with a leg of the extrusion of the head rail 1004'
captured in the slit opening 390 (See Figure 39) of the housing 304. The runnerless screw 320
is then screwed through the opening 326 in the housing 304 and along the side of the
extrusion leg so it may "bite" onto the side of the extrusion leg to secure the cord drive 1006' to
the head rail 1004' The housing cover 300 may then be snapped over the housing 302 to finish
off the assembly. When the other components are installed onto the head rail 1004", the lift
shaft may be connected to the second hub 356 of the output shaft 314, and the collet screw
368 may then be screwed further through the opening 366 to press the lift shaft against the
cavity 364 output shaft 314 for a more secure connection.
[0190]      The operation of the cord drive 1006' is now described. Pulling on one leg of the
drive cord 1007' causes the sprocket 302 to rotate in a first direction which also rotates the
input shaft 308 such that one of the shoulders 340, 342 contacts one of the ends 344, 346 of
the spring 312 to collapse the spring 312 to effectively reduce the inside and outside diameters
of the spring 312. This allows the spring 312 to slip relative to the cavity 370 of the clutch
housing 316, and both the input shaft 308 and spring 312 rotate until one of the ends 344, 346
of the spring 312 contacts one of the shoulders 360, 362 of the output shaft 314. Now all three
components (the input shaft 308, the spring 312, and the output shaft 314) rotate as a unit, and
so does the shaft connected to the end of the output shaft 314. Any component or load
connected to the shaft (such as a spring motor 102', or a lift station 1020' in Figure 22) will also
rotate. In the example in Figure 22, the middle rail 1008' or the bottom rail 1012' may be raised
or lowered depending on which cord drive 1006' is actuated and which leg of the drive cord
1007' is pulled.

                                                  -45
[0191]     Preferably, pulling on the upper leg of the drive cord loop (as seen from the
reference point of Figure 22) results in raising of the shade as this is the more demanding of
the two tasks (raising or lowering of the shade) but this is also the easiest (path of least
resistance) routing of the drive cord 1007' through the cord drive 1006'.
[0192]     As may be appreciated from the above description, no matter which leg of the drive
cord 1007' is pulled by the user, the cord drive 1006' will rotate the sprocket 302, the input
shaft 308, the output shaft 314, and the shaft (if connected to the output shaft 314); in one
instance rotating them in a first direction, and in the other instance rotating them in a second
direction.
[0193]     When the user releases the drive cord 1007', the shoulders 340, 342 of the input
shaft 308 will no longer be pushing against the ends 344, 346 of the spring 312. The spring
312 returns to its at-rest dimension, expanding until it presses against the inside surface of the
cavity 370 of the clutch housing 316. This locks the spring 312 against rotation in the cavity
370 of the clutch housing 316. If a component or load connected to the shaft attempts to back
drive the shaft (for instance, if gravity acts to pull down on the shade), the shaft starts rotating
and rotates the output shaft 314. This happens for only a very few degrees of rotation, until
one of the shoulders 360, 362 of the output shaft 314 contacts one of the ends 344, 346 of the
spring 312 so as to expand the spring 312 to increase the diameter of the coil. This further
presses the spring 312 against the inner surface of the cavity 370 of the clutch housing 316,
causing the spring 312 to lock tightly onto the clutch housing 316, which also prevents further
rotation of the output shaft 314 (and the shaft that is received in and fixed to the output shaft
314), therefore also locking the shade in place.
Alternate embodiment of the cord drive with clutch mechanism
[0194]     Figures 53-56 depict an alternate embodiment of a cord drive 1006*, A visual
comparison of Figures 40 and 56 points out two major differences: the absence of an
assembly screw 310 and the absence of a collet screw 368, A third difference, not immediately
obvious, concerns the projection 392* for rotational support of the roller 306*, These
differences are explained in more detail below.
[0195]     Referring to Figure 56, the cord drive 1006* includes a housing cover 300*, a
sprocket 302*, a housing 304*, a roller 306*, an input shaft 308*, a spring 312*, an output shaft
314*, a clutch housing 316*, and a collet 318* as with the previous embodiment. Referring also
to Figure 55, the cavity 332* of the input shaft 308*, which receives the distal shaft portion 330"

                                                -46
of the sprocket 302*, defines two axially projecting fingers 402* which are designed to snap
into two axially extending openings 404* (See Figure 56A) on the distal shaft portion 330* of
the sprocket 302* and releasabty engage the inner end of the wall 402A* between those
openings. This arrangement eliminates the need for the assembly screw 310 (See Figure 40)
of the previous embodiment 1006'.
[0196]      Referring now to Figures 57 and 58, and comparing these with Figures 52 and 50
respectively, it may be seen that the projection 392* for this alternate embodiment of the cord
drive 1006* does not have a flange 394, but instead has a single finger 394* which projects
radially from the distal end of the projection 392*. This finger 394* acts as a live hinge" which
flexes back toward the projection 392" to allow the roller 306* to slide past the finger 394* to be
mounted onto the projection 392*, and then flexes back out to releasably retain the roller 306*
on the projection 392*. The single finger 394* provides a much smaller potential contact area
to hinder the rotation of the roller 306* on the projection 392* than the flange 394 of the earlier
embodiment.
[0197]      Referring to Figures 53 and 54, the collet 318* is similar to the collet 318 of Figure
40, except that, instead of using a screw 368 to project through the radial opening 366 (See
Figure 44) of the output shaft 314, the collet 318* defines a radially-extending finger 368* with
a slight bump 406" at the distal end of the finger 368*. As the collet 318* is slid over the end of
the hub 356* of the output shaft 314', the bump 406* contacts the hub 356*. displacing the
finger 368* outwardly until the bump 406* reaches the opening 366* on the output shaft 314*.
The finger 368* then snaps back such that the bump 406* enters into the opening 366* to
releasably secure the collet 318" to the output shaft 314*. The finger 368* acts as a "live hinge"
to ensure that the bump 406* may flex outwardly for assembly or disassembly of the collet
318* from the output shaft 314*. but snaps back to push the bump 406* into the opening 366*
to prevent unwanted disassembly of the components.
[0198]      Referring now to Figures 59 and 60, the collet 318* defines a through opening 408*
which receives the lift shaft 1022'. This opening 408* includes a V projection 410* to match a
similar V-shaped recess in the lift shaft 1022' and, diametrically opposite from the "V"
projection 410*, is a land or flat 412*. As best appreciated in Figure 60, this land 412" pushes
down on the lift shaft 1022" to press the lift shaft 1022' against the "V" projection 410* to
ensure a secure engagement of the lift shaft 1022' to the collet 318* and to the output shaft
316* to which it is connected.

                                                 -47
[0199]     This cord drive 1006* operates in the same manner as the cord drive 1006'
described earlier,
Another alternate embodiment of the cord drive with clutch mechanism
[0200]      Figures 61-63 depict another alternate embodiment of a cord drive 1006**. A
comparison of Figure 40, showing the previous embodiment and Figure 61 showing this
embodiment, highlights a major difference in the housing 304** of this embodiment, which
allows for a bottom entry and exit of the drive cords instead of a side access, as described in
more detail below. A second difference, not immediately obvious, concerns the sprocket 302**
which provides a double journal for improved rotational support, as described in more detail
later.
[0201]      Referring to Figure 61, the cord drive 1006** includes a housing cover 300**, a
sprocket 302**, a housing 304**, an input shaft 308**, an assembly screw 310**. a spring
312**, an output shaft 314**, a clutch housing 316**, and a collet 313**. Also shown in Figure
61 is a stub shaft 325** (on the housing 304**) which defines a through opening 326** which
acts as a first bearing support (or first journal) for the sprocket 302** , as discussed in more
detail below.
[0202]     A direct comparison of the housings 304 (in Figure 40) and 304** (in Figure 61)
readily reveals the change which allows bottom access of the drive cords (not shown) in the
housing 304"*, It should also be noted that this change has three other implications:
- The roller 306 has been eliminated. A guiding post 392** is used to help keep the drive cords
untangled at the access point to the cord drive 1006**
- The housing 304** (which is shown in Figure 61 for use on the left end of a window covering)
need only be flipped over to function as the housing for the right end of a window covering.
 - The cord drive 1006** now offers the same degree of efficiency of operation regardless of
the direction of rotation of the sprocket 302**. That is, the routing of the drive cord through the
cord drive 1006** for raising or lowering the window covering is now immaterial.
[0203]      Referring to Figures 62 and 63, the sprocket 302** is similar to the sprocket 302 of
Fig. 37, It includes a pulley 322** defining a plurality of circumferentially-placed, staggered,
and alternating wedges 324** which both guide and releasably engage the drive cord 1007'
(See Figure 22) such that pulling on one leg of the drive cord 1007' rotates the sprocket 302**
in one direction and pulling on the other leg of the drive cord 1007' rotates the sprocket 302**

                                                  -48
in the opposite direction relative to the housing 304**. The drive cord rests in a V-shaped
groove, which defines a plane 350** (shown in Figure 63).
[0204]      The sprocket 302** also defines an axially extending shaft with an axis that is
substantially perpendicular to the plane 350**, with a first, proximal shaft portion 328** having
a cylindrical outer surface 329**, which is supported for rotation on the inner surface 326** of a
stationary stub shaft 325** on the housing 304**, and a second, distal shaft portion 330** with
a non-circular outer cross-section which matches a similarly profiled cavity 332** (See Figure
61) in the input shaft 308**. When assembled, the distal shaft portion 330** of the sprocket
302** is received in the cavity 332** of the input shaft 308**, such that rotation of the sprocket
302** results in rotation of the input shaft 308**.
[0205]      The sprocket 302** also has a recessed inner hub 334**, which defines a cylindrical
inner surface 327** coaxial with the shaft 328**. Referring to Figure 63, the proximal shaft
328** of the sprocket 302** rides in, and is supported by, the first journal bearing surface 326**
which is the inside surface of the stub shaft 325** of the housing 304**. The outside surface
331** of this same stub shaft 325** is a second journal surface for the sprocket 302*-*, as the
inner surface 327** of the recessed inner hub 334** rides on, and is supported by, that outside
surface 331 ** of the stub shaft 325**. It should be noted that a portion of the first journal
bearing surface 326** and a portion of the second journal bearing surface 326** lie on the
plane 350** of the cord, so there is bearing support for the sprocket 302** directly in line with
the cord on both of the bearing surfaces.
[0206]      As a practical matter, and in order to minimize friction between the sprocket 302**
and the stub shaft 325** of the housing 304**, there is more clearance between the inner
surface 327** of the hub 334** and the outer surface 331 "* of the stub shaft 325*" (the second
journal surface) than there is between the outer surface 329"*of the proximal shaft 328** and
the inner surface 326" of the stub shaft 325"* (the first journal surface). This means that the
sprocket 302** is initially supported for rotation only by the first journal surface 326** unless
and until there is sufficient wear on this first journal surface 326** for the second journal
surface 331 ** to come into play. It is expected that the first journal surface 326"*will suffice for
the life of the covering for most applications, Only in applications involving a very heavy
covering may the second journal surface 331** ever come into play, and then only after many
thousands of cycles of operation. However, the second journal surface 331** would be there to
provide support and prevent failure of the mechanism even if there were substantial wear of
the first journal surface 326**.

                                                 -49
[0207]   Other than for the differences described above, this cord drive 1006** operates in the
same manner as the cord drive 1006 described earlier.
[0208]    It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that modifications may be made to the
embodiments described above without departing from the scope of the present invention as
defined by the claims.
