15                              FIELD OF THE INVENTION
           The disclosure herein relates to foam-forming compositions comprising (a)
   an azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture comprising cis-1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluoro-2
   butene and (b) an active hydrogen-containing compounds, and using such
   compositions for producing polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams.
20
                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           Closed-cell polyisocyanate-based foams are widely used for insulation
   purposes, for example, in building construction and in the manufacture of energy
   efficient electrical appliances. In the construction industry,
25 polyurethane/polyisocyanurate board stock is used in roofing and siding for its
   insulation and load-carrying capabilities. Poured and sprayed polyurethane
   foams are widely used for a variety of applications including insulating roofs,
   insulating large structures such as storage tanks, insulating appliances such as
   refrigerators and freezers, insulating refrigerated trucks and railcars, etc.
30         All of these various types of polyurethane/polyisocyanurate foams require
   blowing agents for their manufacture. Insulating foams depend on the use of
   halocarbon blowing agents, not only to foam the polymer, but primarily for their
   low vapor thermal conductivity, a very important characteristic for insulation
                                             -2-

   value. Historically, polyurethane foams used CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons, for
   example CFC-1 1, trichlorofluoromethane) and HCFCs
   (hydrochlorofluorocarbons, for example HCFC-1 41 b, 1,1 -dichloro-1-fluoroethane)
   as the primary blowing agent. However, due to the implication of chlorine
 5 containing molecules such as the CFCs and HCFCs in the destruction of
   stratospheric ozone, the production and use of CFCs and HCFCs has been
   restricted by the Montreal Protocol. More recently, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
   which do not contribute to the destruction of stratospheric ozone, have been
   employed as blowing agents for polyurethane foams. An example of an HFC
10 employed in this application is HFC-245fa (1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane). The
   HFCs do not contribute to the destruction of stratospheric ozone, but are of
   concern due to their contribution to the "greenhouse effect", i.e., they contribute
   to global warming. As a result of their contribution to global warming, the HFCs
   have come under scrutiny, and their widespread use may also be limited in the
15 future.
           Hydrocarbons have also been proposed as foam blowing agents.
   However, these compounds are flammable, and many are photochemically
   reactive, and as a result contribute to the production of ground level ozone (i.e.,
   smog). Such compounds are typically referred to as volatile organic compounds
20 (VOCs), and are subject to environmental regulations.
           There is need for producing foams that provide low flammability, good
   thermal insulation and high dimensional stability by using a blowing agent that
   has substantially no ozone depletion potential (ODP) and no or very low global
   warming potential (GWP). Cis-1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluoro-2-butene (Z-FC-1336mzz,
25 or Z-CF3CH=CHCF3) is one of the good candidates.
           Japanese Patent No. 05179043 discloses and attempts to use cis
   1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluoro-2-butene as the blowing agent for polyurethane foams.

                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
          A blowing agent composition (also known as foam expansion agents or
   foam expansion compositions) often desires a pure single component or an
   azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture. For example, when a blowing agent
10 composition is not a pure single component or an azeotropic or azeotrope-like
   mixture, the composition may change during its application in the foam forming
   process. Such change in composition could detrimentally affect processing or
   cause poor performance in the application. Accordingly, there is need for
   producing polyurethane/polyisocyanurate foams by using azeotropic or
15 azeotrope-like mixtures containing Z-FC-1336mzz as the blowing agent.
          Before addressing details of embodiments described below, some terms
   are defined or clarified.
          By "cream time", it is meant to refer to the time period starting from the
   mixing of the active hydrogen-containing compound with polyisocyanate, and
20 ending at when the foaming starts to occur and color of the mixture starts to
   change.
          By "rise time", it is meant to refer to the time period starting from the
   mixing of the active hydrogen-containing compound with polyisocyanate, and
   ending at when the foam rising stops.
25        By "tack free time", it is meant to refer to the time period starting from the
   mixing of the active hydrogen-containing compound with polyisocyanate, and
   ending at when the surface of the foam is no longer tacky.
          By "initial R-value", it is meant to refer to the polymer foam's insulation
   value (thermal resistance) measured at a mean temperature of 75 IF within 24
30 hours after the foam is formed and becomes tack free.
          Z-FC-1336mzz is a known compound, and its preparation method has
   been disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication No. US2008/0269532,
   hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
                                              -5-

           This application includes foam-forming compositions comprising (a) an
   azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture comprising Z-FC-1 336mzz; and (b) an active
   hydrogen-containing compound.
           In some embodiments of this invention, the foam-forming composition
 5 comprises: (a) an azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture of Z-FC-1 336mzz and
   methyl formate; and (b) an active hydrogen-containing compound having two or
   more active hydrogens, in the form of hydroxyl groups. In this disclosure, the
   azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture of Z-FC-1 336mzz and methyl formate is
   used as a blowing agent. Blowing agents Z-FC-1 336mzz and methyl formate
10 form an azeotrope-like mixture. Typically these are combined prior to mixing with
   the other components in the foam-forming compositions. Alternatively, one can
   be mixed with some or all of the other components before the other is mixed in.
   For example, Z-FC-1 336mzz can be first mixed with the other components in the
   foam-forming compositions before methyl formate is added in. In one
15 embodiment, the azeotrope like mixture contains between 1-99% by weight of Z
   FC-1 336mzz, and 99-1% by weight of methyl formate. In one embodiment, the
   azeotrope like mixture contains between 50-92% by weight of Z-FC-1 336mzz
   and 50-8% by weight of methyl formate.      In one embodiement, the azeotrope like
   mixture contains 90% by weight of Z-FC-1 336mzz and 10% by weight of methyl
20 formate.
           The azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixtures of Z-FC-1 336mzz and methyl
   formate has been described in U.S. Patent Application No. 60/926617 [FL1369
   US PRV] filed April/27/2007, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
           In some embodiments of this invention, the foam-forming composition
25 comprises: (a) an azeotrope-like mixture of Z-FC-1336mzz and 1,1,1,3,3
   pentafluorobutane; and (b) an active hydrogen-containing compound having two
   or more active hydrogens, in the form of hydroxyl groups. In this disclosure, the
   azeotrope-like mixture of Z-FC-1 336mzz and 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane (HFC
   365mfc, or CF3CH2CF2CH3) is used as a blowing agent. Blowing agents Z-FC
30 1336mzz and HFC-365mfc form an azeotrope-like mixture. Typically these are
   combined prior to mixing with the other components in the foam-forming
   compositions. Alternatively, one can be mixed with some or all of the other
   components before the other is mixed in. For example, Z-FC-1336mzz can be
   first mixed with the other components in the foam-forming compositions before
                                           -6-

   HFC-365mfc is added in. In one embodiment, the azeotrope like mixture contains
   between 1-99% by weight of Z-FC-1336mzz, and 99-1% by weight of HFC
   365mfc. In one embodiment, the azeotrope like mixture contains between 45
   95% by weight of Z-FC-1336mzz and 55-5% by weight of HFC-365mfc.           In one
 5 embodiement, the azeotrope like mixture contains 80% by weight of Z-FC
   1336mzz and 20% by weight of HFC-365mfc.

   described in U.S. Patent Application No. 60/930383 [FL1401 US PRV] filed
   May/1 6/2007, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
10         In some embodiments of this invention, the foam-forming composition
   comprises: (a) an azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture of Z-FC-1 336mzz and
   trans-1,2-dichloroethylene; and (b) an active hydrogen-containing compound
   having two or more active hydrogens, in the form of hydroxyl groups. In this
   disclosure, the azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture of Z-FC-1336mzz and trans
15 1,2-dichloroethylene (trans-1,2-DCE, or trans- CICH=CHCI) is used as a blowing
   agent. Blowing agents Z-FC-1 336mzz and trans-1,2-dichloroethylene form an
   azeotrope-like mixture. Typically these are combined prior to mixing with the
   other components in the foam-forming compositions. Alternatively, one can be
   mixed with some or all of the other components before the other is mixed in. For
20 example, Z-FC-1336mzz can be first mixed with the other components in the
   foam-forming compositions before trans-1,2-dichloroethylene is added in. In one
   embodiment, the azeotrope like mixture contains between 66-99% by weight of
   Z-FC-1 336mzz, and 34-1% by weight of trans-1,2-dichloroethylene. In one
   embodiment, the azeotrope like mixture contains between 68-95% by weight of
25 Z-FC-1 336mzz and 32-5% by weight of trans-1,2-dichloroethylene. In one
   embodiement, the azeotropic mixture contains 74.7% by weight of Z-FC
   1336mzz and 25.3% by weight of trans-1,2-dichloroethylene. In one
   embodiement, the azeotrope like mixture contains 68% by weight of Z-FC
   1336mzz and 32% by weight of trans-1,2-dichloroethylene
30         The azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixtures of Z-FC-1 336mzz and trans-1,2
   dichloroethylene has been described in U.S. Patent Application No. 60/931960

           In some embodiments of this invention, the foam-forming composition
   comprises: (a) an azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture of Z-FC-1 336mzz and
   pentane; and (b) an active hydrogen-containing compound having two or more
   active hydrogens, in the form of hydroxyl groups. In this disclosure, the
 5 azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture of Z-FC-1 336mzz and pentane is used as a
   blowing agent. Blowing agents Z-FC-1336mzz and pentane form an azeotrope
   like mixture. Typically these are combined prior to mixing with the other
   components in the foam-forming compositions. Alternatively, one can be mixed
   with some or all of the other components before the other is mixed in. For
10 example, Z-FC-1336mzz can be first mixed with the other components in the
   foam-forming compositions before pentane is added in. In one embodiment, the
   azeotrope like mixture contains between 62-78% by weight of Z-FC-1336mzz,
   and 38-22% by weight of pentane. In one embodiment, the azeotrope like
   mixture contains between 64-76% by weight of Z-FC-1336mzz and 36-24% by
15 weight of pentane. In one embodiement, the azeotropic mixture contains 70.2%

   active hydrogens, in the form of hydroxyl groups. In this disclosure, the
   azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture of Z-FC-1 336mzz and isopentane is used as
25 a blowing agent. Blowing agents Z-FC-1336mzz and isopentane form an
   azeotrope-like mixture. Typically these are combined prior to mixing with the
   other components in the foam-forming compositions. Alternatively, one can be
   mixed with some or all of the other components before the other is mixed in. For
   example, Z-FC-1336mzz can be first mixed with the other components in the
30 foam-forming compositions before isopentane is added in. In one embodiment,
   the azeotrope like mixture contains between 51-70% by weight of Z-FC
   1336mzz, and 49-30% by weight of isopentane. In one embodiment, the
   azeotrope like mixture contains between 54-67% by weight of Z-FC-1336mzz
   and 46-33% by weight of isopentane. In one embodiement, the azeotropic

10 more active hydrogens, in the form of hydroxyl groups. In this disclosure, the
   azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture of Z-FC-1 336mzz and cyclopentane is used
   as a blowing agent. Blowing agents Z-FC-1336mzz and cyclopentane form an
   azeotrope-like mixture. Typically these are combined prior to mixing with the
   other components in the foam-forming compositions. Alternatively, one can be
15 mixed with some or all of the other components before the other is mixed in. For

30 (b) an active hydrogen-containing compound having two or more active
   hydrogens, in the form of hydroxyl groups. In this disclosure, the azeotrope-like
   mixture of Z-FC-1336mzz and HFC-245fa is used as a blowing agent. Blowing
   agents Z-FC-1 336mzz and HFC-245fa form an azeotrope-like mixture. Typically
   these are combined prior to mixing with the other components in the foam
                                           -9-

   forming compositions. Alternatively, one can be mixed with some or all of the
   other components before the other is mixed in. For example, Z-FC-1336mzz can
   be first mixed with the other components in the foam-forming compositions
   before HFC-245fa is added in. In one embodiment, the azeotrope-like mixture
 5 contains between 1-24% by weight of Z-FC-1336mzz, and 99-76% by weight of
   HFC-245fa. In one embodiment, the azeotrope like mixture contains between 3
   22% by weight of Z-FC-1 336mzz and 97-78% by weight of HFC-245fa. In one
   embodiement, the azeotrope like mixture contains 20% by weight of Z-FC
   1336mzz and 80% by weight of HFC-245fa.
10         The azeotrope-like mixtures of Z-FC-1336mzz and HFC-245fa has been
   described in U.S. Patent Application No. 60/931875 [FL1405 US PRV] filed
   May/24/2007, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
           In some embodiments of this invention, the foam-forming composition
   comprises: (a) an azeotrope-like mixture of Z-FC-1336mzz and
15 dimethoxymethane; and (b) an active hydrogen-containing compound having two
   or more active hydrogens, in the form of hydroxyl groups. In this disclosure, the
   azeotrope-like mixture of Z-FC-1 336mzz and dimethoxymethane is used as a
   blowing agent. Blowing agents Z-FC-1336mzz and dimethoxymethane form an
   azeotrope-like mixture. Typically these are combined prior to mixing with the
20 other components in the foam-forming compositions. Alternatively, one can be
   mixed with some or all of the other components before the other is mixed in. For
   example, Z-FC-1336mzz can be first mixed with the other components in the
   foam-forming compositions before dimethoxymethane is added in. In one
   embodiment, the azeotrope like mixture contains between 1-99% by weight of Z
25 FC-1336mzz, and 99-1% by weight of dimethoxymethane. In one embodiment,
   the azeotrope like mixture contains between 67-97% by weight of Z-FC-1 336mzz
   and 33-3% by weight of dimethoxymethane. In one embodiement, the azeotrope
   like mixture contains 85% by weight of Z-FC-1 336mzz and 15% by weight of
   dimethoxymethane.
30         The azeotrope-like mixtures of Z-FC-1336mzz and dimethoxymethane has
   been described in U.S. Patent Application No. 60/967874 [FL1 427 US PRV] filed
   September/7/2007, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
           As recognized in the art, an azeotropic or an azeotrope-like mixture is an
   admixture of two or more different components which, when in liquid form under
                                           -10-

   a given pressure, will boil at a substantially constant temperature, which
   temperature may be higher or lower than the boiling temperatures of the
   individual components, and which will provide a vapor composition essentially
   identical to the liquid composition undergoing boiling.
 5         For the purpose of this discussion, an azeotrope-like mixture means a
   composition that behaves like an azeotrope (i.e., has constant boiling
   characteristics or a tendency not to fractionate upon boiling or evaporation).
   Thus, the composition of the vapor formed during boiling or evaporation is the
   same as or substantially the same as the original liquid composition. Hence,
10 during boiling or evaporation, the liquid composition, if it changes at all, changes
   only to a minimal or negligible extent. This is to be contrasted with non
   azeotrope-like compositions in which during boiling or evaporation, the liquid
   composition changes to a substantial degree.
           Additionally, azeotrope-like compositions exhibit dew point pressure and
15 bubble point pressure with virtually no pressure differential. That is to say that
   the difference in the dew point pressure and bubble point pressure at a given
   temperature will be a small value. In this invention, compositions with a
   difference in dew point pressure and bubble point pressure of less than or equal
   to 3 percent (based upon the bubble point pressure) is considered to be
20 azeotrope-like.
           Accordingly, the essential features of an azeotropic or an azeotrope-like
   composition are that at a given pressure, the boiling point of the liquid
   composition is fixed and that the composition of the vapor above the boiling
   composition is essentially that of the boiling liquid composition (i.e., no
25 fractionation of the components of the liquid composition takes place). It is also
   recognized in the art that both the boiling point and the weight percentages of
   each component of the azeotropic composition may change when the azeotropic
   or azeotrope-like liquid composition is subjected to boiling at different pressures.
   Thus, an azeotropic or an azeotrope-like composition may be defined in terms of
30 the unique relationship that exists among the components or in terms of the
   compositional ranges of the components or in terms of exact weight percentages
   of each component of the composition characterized by a fixed boiling point at a
   specified pressure. It is also recognized in the art that various azeotropic
   compositions (including their boiling points at particular pressures) may be
                                            - 11 -

   calculated (see, e.g., W. Schotte Ind. Eng. Chem. Process Des. Dev. (1980) 19,
   432-439). Experimental identification of azeotropic compositions involving the
   same components may be used to confirm the accuracy of such calculations
   and/or to modify the calculations at the same or other temperatures and
 5 pressures.
           The active hydrogen-containing compounds of this invention can comprise
   compounds having two or more groups that contain an active hydrogen atom
   reactive with an isocyanate group, such as described in U.S. Patent No.
   4,394,491; hereby incorporated by reference. Examples of such compounds
10 have at least two hydroxyl groups per molecule, and more specifically comprise
   polyols, such as polyether or polyester polyols. Examples of such polyols are
   those which have an equivalent weight of about 50 to about 700, normally of
   about 70 to about 300, more typically of about 90 to about 270, and carry at least
   2 hydroxyl groups, usually 3 to 8 such groups.
15         Examples of suitable polyols comprise polyester polyols such as aromatic
   polyester polyols, e.g., those made by transesterifying polyethylene terephthalate
   (PET) scrap with a glycol such as diethylene glycol, or made by reacting phthalic
   anhydride with a glycol. The resulting polyester polyols may be reacted further
   with ethylene - and/or propylene oxide - to form an extended polyester polyol
20 containing additional internal alkyleneoxy groups.
           Examples of suitable polyols also comprise polyether polyols such as
   polyethylene oxides, polypropylene oxides, mixed polyethylene-propylene oxides
   with terminal hydroxyl groups, among others. Other suitable polyols can be
   prepared by reacting ethylene and/or propylene oxide with an initiator having 2 to
25 16, generally 3 to 8 hydroxyl groups as present, for example, in glycerol,
   pentaerythritol and carbohydrates such as sorbitol, glucose, sucrose and the like
   polyhydroxy compounds. Suitable polyether polyols can also include alaphatic or
   aromatic amine-based polyols.
           The present invention also relates to processes for producing a closed-cell
30 polyurethane or polyisocyanurate polymer foam by reacting an effective amount
   of the foam-forming compositions with a suitable polyisocyanate.
           Typically, before reacting with a suitable polyisocyanate, the active
   hydrogen-containing compound described hereinabove and optionally other
   additives are mixed with the blowing agent to form a foam-forming composition.
                                            -12-

   Such foam-forming composition is typically known in the art as an isocyanate
   reactive preblend, or B-side composition. The foam-forming composition of this
   invention can be prepared in any manner convenient to one skilled in this art,
   including simply weighing desired quantities of each component and, thereafter,
 5 combining them in an appropriate container at appropriate temperatures and
   pressures.
          When preparing polyisocyanate-based foams, the polyisocyanate reactant
   is normally selected in such proportion relative to that of the active hydrogen
   containing compound that the ratio of the equivalents of isocyanate groups to the
10 equivalents of active hydrogen groups, i.e., the foam index, is from about 0.9 to
   about 10 and in most cases from about 1 to about 4.
          While any suitable polyisocyanate can be employed in the instant process,
   examples of suitable polyisocyanates useful for making polyisocyanate-based
   foam comprise at least one of aromatic, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic
15 polyisocyanates, among others. Representative members of these compounds
   comprise diisocyanates such as meta- or paraphenylene diisocyanate, toluene
   2,4-diisocyanate, toluene-2,6-diisocyanate, hexamethylene-1,6-diisocyanate,
   tetramethylene-1,4-diisocyanate, cyclohexane-1,4-diisocyanate,
   hexahydrotoluene diisocyanate (and isomers), napthylene-1,5-diisocyanate, 1-
20 methylphenyl-2,4-phenyldiisocyanate, diphenylmethane-4,4-diisocyanate,
   diphenylmethane-2,4-diissocyanate, 4,4 -biphenylenediisocyanate and 3,3
   dimethyoxy-4,4 biphenylenediisocyanate and 3,3-dimethyldiphenylpropane-4,4
   diisocyanate; triisocyanates such as toluene-2,4,6-triisocyanate and
   polyisocyanates such as 4,4 -dimethyldiphenylmethane-2,2,5,5-tetraisocyanate
25 and the diverse polymethylenepoly-phenylopolyisocyanates, mixtures thereof,
   among others.
          A crude polyisocyanate may also be used in the practice of this invention,
   such as the crude toluene diisocyanate obtained by the phosgenating a mixture
   comprising toluene diamines, or the crude diphenylmethane diisocyanate
30 obtained by the phosgenating crude diphenylmethanediamine. Specific
   examples of such compounds comprise methylene-bridged
   polyphenylpolyisocyanates, due to their ability to crosslink the polyurethane.
           It is often desirable to employ minor amounts of additives in preparing
   polyisocyanate-based foams. Among these additives comprise one or more
                                            -13-

   members from the group consisting of catalysts, surfactants, flame retardants,
   preservatives, colorants, antioxidants, reinforcing agents, filler, antistatic agents,
   among others well known in this art.
           Depending upon the composition, a surfactant can be employed to
 5 stabilize the foaming reaction mixture while curing. Such surfactants normally
   comprise a liquid or solid organosilicone compound. The surfactants are
   employed in amounts sufficient to stabilize the foaming reaction mixture against
   collapse and to prevent the formation of large, uneven cells. In one embodiment
   of this invention, about 0.1% to about 5% by weight of surfactant based on the
10 total weight of all foaming ingredients (i.e. blowing agents + active hydrogen
   containing compounds + polyisocyanates + additives) are used. In another
   embodiment of this invention, about 1.5% to about 3% by weight of surfactant
   based on the total weight of all foaming ingredients are used.
           One or more catalysts for the reaction of the active hydrogen-containing
15 compounds, e.g. polyols, with the polyisocyanate may be also employed. While
   any suitable urethane catalyst may be employed, specific catalyst comprise
   tertiary amine compounds and organometallic compounds. Exemplary such
   catalysts are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,164,419, which
   disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. For example, a catalyst for the
20 trimerization of polyisocyanates, such as an alkali metal alkoxide, alkali metal
   carboxylate, or quaternary amine compound, may also optionally be employed
   herein. Such catalysts are used in an amount which measurably increases the
   rate of reaction of the polyisocyanate. Typical amounts of catalysts are about
   0.1% to about 5% by weight based on the total weight of all foaming ingredients.
25         In the process of the invention for making a polyisocyanate-based foam,
   the active hydrogen-containing compound (e.g. polyol), polyisocyanate and other
   components are contacted, thoroughly mixed, and permitted to expand and cure
   into a cellular polymer. The mixing apparatus is not critical, and various
   conventional types of mixing head and spray apparatus are used. By
30 conventional apparatus is meant apparatus, equipment, and procedures
   conventionally employed in the preparation of isocyanate-based foams in which
   conventional isocyanate-based foam blowing agents, such as
   fluorotrichloromethane (CCl3F, CFC-1 1), are employed. Such conventional
   apparatus are discussed by: H. Boden et al. in chapter 4 of the Polyurethane
                                            -14-

           In one embodiment of this invention, a preblend of certain raw materials is
   prepared prior to reacting the polyisocyanate and active hydrogen-containing
   components. For example, it is often useful to blend the polyol(s), blowing agent,
   surfactant(s), catalysts(s) and other foaming ingredients, except for
15 polyisocyanates, and then contact this blend with the polyisocyanate.
   Alternatively, all the foaming ingredients may be introduced individually to the
   mixing zone where the polyisocyanate and polyol(s) are contacted. It is also
   possible to pre-react all or a portion of the polyol(s) with the polyisocyanate to
   form a prepolymer.
20         The invention composition and processes are applicable to the production
   of all kinds of expanded polyurethane foams, including, for example, integral skin,
   RIM and flexible foams, and in particular rigid closed-cell polymer foams useful in
   spray insulation, as pour-in-place appliance foams, or as rigid insulating board
   stock and laminates.
25         The present invention also relates to the closed-cell polyurethane or
   polyisocyanurate polymer foams prepared from reaction of effective amounts of
   the foam-forming composition of this disclosure and a suitable polyisocyanate.
