                                      BACKGROUND
[0002]      The present invention relates to implantable medical devices made entirely
or partially of silk, including silk medical devices with at least one surface (i.e. a top
surface or a bottom surface of the silk medical device) made or prepared so that, after
in vivo implantation of the silk medical device (such as implantation in conjunction with
a medical or surgical procedure, such as an abdominal procedure, such as a hernia
repair procedure) adhesion or attachment of a tissue (such as a human abdominal,
bowel or intestinal tissue) to that surface or surfaces of the silk medical device is
prevented, substantially prevented, discouraged and/or not facilitated (hence an "anti
adhesive" surface). In particular the present invention relates to single layer and multi
laminate, anti-adhesive surface silk based devices comprising one or more of a silk
film, a silk sponge, and a knitted silk fiber or fabric as well as methods for making and
using, for example in abdominal surgery. The devices can be combined with or coated
with a hyaluronic acid or other macromolecule (such as for example dextran, heparin
and sulphates thereof)
[0003]      Silk is a natural (non-synthetic) protein that can be processed into high
strength fibroin fibers with mechanical properties similar to or better than many of
                                              1

 WO 2015/027144                                                        PCT/US2014/052264
synthetic high performance fibers. Silk is stable at physiological temperatures in a wide
range of pH, and is insoluble in most aqueous and organic solvents. As a protein,
unlike the case with most if not all synthetic polymers, the degradation products (e.g.
peptides, amino acids) of silk are biocompatible. Silk is non-mammalian derived and
carries far less bioburden than other comparable natural biomaterials (e.g. bovine or
porcine derived collagen). Silk, as the term is generally known in the art, means a
filamentous fiber product secreted by an organism such as a silkworm or spider. Silks
can be made by certain insects such as for example Bombyx mori silkworms, and
Nephilia clavipes spiders. There are many variants of natural silk. Fibroin is produced
and secreted by a silkworm's two silk glands. As fibroin leaves the glands it is coated
with sericin a glue-like substance. Spider silk is produced as a single filament lacking
the immunogenic protein sericin.
[0004]       Silk has been used in biomedical applications. The Bombyx mori species of
silkworm produces a silk fiber (a "bave") and uses the fiber to build its cocoon. The
bave as produced include two fibroin filaments or broins which are surrounded with a
coating of the gummy, antigenic protein sericin. Silk fibers harvested for making
textiles, sutures and clothing are not sericin extracted or are sericin depleted or only to
a minor extent and typically the silk remains at least 10% to 26% by weight sericin.
Retaining the sericin coating protects the frail fibroin filaments from fraying during
textile manufacture. Hence textile grade silk is generally made of sericin coated silk
fibroin fibers. Medical grade silkworm silk is used as either as virgin silk suture, where
the sericin has not been removed, or as a silk suture from which the sericin has been
removed and replaced with a wax or silicone coating to provide a barrier between the
silk fibroin and the body tissue and cells.
[0005]       Hyaluronic acid (HA) (synonymously hyaluron or hyaluronate) is a naturally
occurring glucosaminoglycan that has been used as a constituent of a dermal filler for
wrinkle reduction and tissue volumizing. Hyaluronan is an anionic, nonsulfated
glycosaminoglycan distributed widely throughout connective, epithelial, and neural
tissues. Polymeric hyaluronic acid can have a molecular weight of several million
Daltons. An individual can typically have about 15 grams of hyaluronan in his body
about a third of which every day is degraded by endogenous enzymes and free
radicals within a few hours or days and replaced by hyaluronic acid newly synthesized
by the body.

[00025]     Implantable, knitted silk fabrics for surgical use are known. See eg US patent
applications 2004/0224406 and 2012/0029537. Post operative adhesions are a
common occurrence after surgery and are undesirable. For example postoperative
intra-abdominal and pelvic adhesions are the leading cause of infertility, chronic pelvic
pain, and intestinal obstruction. Adhesions form as a result of the body's natural
healing response and imply migration of fibroblasts to the trauma/wound site, cell
proliferation, de novo extracellular matrix secretion and wound closing through
adhesion formations. Post-operative adhesions can occur at the tissue-tissue interface
(i.e. peritendinous tissue adhesion involves adhesion between the repaired tendon and
the surrounding tissue) or at a tissue-biomaterial interface, in cases where a
biomaterial (i.e. a supporting scaffold) is used to reinforce the mechanical properties of
the repaired tissue. For example in hernia repair where a biomaterial mesh is used to
reinforce the reconstructed abdominal wall, adhesions commonly form between the
mesh and underlying bowel tissue.
[00026]     Thus there is a need for an implantable biomaterial mesh that can decrease
or eliminate formation of post-operative adhesions.

[00039]    Aspects of the present invention are illustrated by the following drawings.
[00040]    Figure 1 illustrates the procedure for casting a silk form from a silk solution to
thereby make a water resistant silk film. The middle drawing in Figure 1 shows the silk
solution being dispensed from a pipette. "EtOH" in Figure 1 means application of
ethanol to the silk film.
[00041]    Figure 2 illustrates the procedure for making a multi laminate medical device
using the water resistant silk film made by the Figure 1 process. In Figure 2 the water
resistant silk film is shown fused onto a knitted silk mesh (the particular knitted silk
mesh used was SERI@ Surgical Scaffold, available from Allergan, Irvine, California).

on the right hand side of Figure 4 a top view photograph of the water resistant silk film
made by the process of Figure 1.
[00044]    Figure 5 is a pictorial representation of how the silk film made by the process

[00051]      Figure 12 is a pictorial illustration of the silk film adherence mechanism to
wet or moist surfaces. The hydrophilicity of the contact surface probably triggers silk
fibroin structural rearrangements that lead to the reorientation of the hydrophilic and
hydrophobic regions of the protein to promote the most energetically favorable
interactions.

                                       DESCRIPTION
[00072]    The present invention is based on the discovery of laminate silk medical
devices that can be implanted to separate adjoining tissues, provide soft tissue support
and/or reduce formation of adhesions.
[00073]    The silk films and the silk fabrics set forth herein can be made from silkworm
cocoons substantially depleted of sericin. A preferred source of raw silk is from the
silkworm B. mori. Other sources of silk include other strains of Bombycidae including
Antheraea pernyi, Antheraea yamamai, Antheraea mylitta, Antheraea assama, and
Philosamia cynthia ricini, as well as silk producing members of the families Saturnidae,
 Thaumetopoeidae, and silk-producing members of the order Araneae. Suitable silk can
also be obtained from other spider, caterpillar, or recombinant sources. Methods for
performing sericin extraction have been described in pending U.S. Patent Application
Ser. No. 10/008,924, U.S. Publication No. 2003/0100108, Matrix for the production of
tissue engineered ligaments, tendons and other tissue.
[00074]    Extractants such as urea solution, hot water, enzyme solutions including
papain among others which are known in the art to remove sericin from fibroin would
also be acceptable for generation of the silk. Mechanical methods may also be used for
the removal of sericin from silk fibroin. This includes but is not limited to ultrasound,
abrasive scrubbing and fluid flow. The rinse post-extraction is conducted preferably
with vigorous agitation to remove substantially any ionic contaminants, soluble, and
insoluble debris present on the silk as monitored through microscopy and solution
electrochemical measurements. A criterion is that the extractant predictably and
repeatably remove the sericin coat of the source silk without significantly compromising
the molecular structure of the fibroin. For example, an extraction may be evaluated for
sericin removal via mass loss, amino acid content analysis, and scanning electron
microscopy. Fibroin degradation may in turn be monitored by FTIR analysis, standard
protein gel electrophoresis and scanning electron microscopy.
[00075]    In certain cases, the silk utilized for making the composition has been
substantially depleted of its native sericin content (i.e., : 4% (w/w) residual sericin in
the final extracted silk). Alternatively, higher concentrations of residual sericin may be
left on the silk following extraction or the extraction step may be omitted. In preferred
aspects of this embodiment, the sericin-depleted silk fibroin has, e.g. about 0% to
                                              15

WO 2015/027144                                                             PCT/US2014/052264
about 4% (w/w) residual sericin. In the most preferred aspects of this embodiment, the
sericin-depleted silk fibroin has, e.g. about 1 % to 3% (w/w) residual sericin.
[00076]      In certain cases, the silk utilized for generation of a medical device within the
scope of the present invention is entirely free of its native sericin content. As used
herein, the term "entirely free (i.e. "consisting of' terminology) means that within the
detection range of the instrument or process being used, the substance cannot be
detected or its presence cannot be confirmed.
[00077]     The water soluble or dissolved silk can be prepared by a 4 hour solubilization
(process of silk into solution) at 60  0C  of pure silk fibroin at a concentration of 200 g/L in
a 9.3 M aqueous solution of lithium bromide to a silk concentration of 20% (w/v). This
process may be conducted by other means provided that they deliver a similar degree
of dissociation to that provided by a 4 hour solubilization at 60      0C of pure silk fibroin at
a concentration of 200 g/L in a 9.3 M aqueous solution of lithium bromide. The primary
goal of this is to create uniformly and repeatably dissociated silk fibroin molecules to
ensure similar fibroin solution properties and, subsequently, device properties. Less
substantially dissociated silk solution may have altered gelation kinetics resulting in
differing final gel properties. The degree of dissociation may be indicated by Fourier
transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) or x-ray diffraction (XRD) and other modalities
that quantitatively and qualitatively measure protein structure. Additionally, one may
confirm that heavy and light chain domains of the silk fibroin dimer have remained
intact following silk processing and dissolution. This may be achieved by methods such
as standard protein sodium-dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS
PAGE) which assess molecular weight of the independent silk fibroin domains.
[00078]     System parameters which may be modified in the initial dissolution of silk
include but are not limited to solvent type, silk concentration, temperature, pressure,
and addition of mechanical disruptive forces. Solvent types other than aqueous lithium
bromide may include but are not limited to aqueous solutions, alcohol solutions,
1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol,             and         hexafluoroacetone,          1-butyl-3
methylimidazolium. These solvents may be further enhanced by addition of urea or
ionic species including lithium bromide, calcium chloride, lithium thiocyanate, zinc
chloride, magnesium salts, sodium thiocyanate, and other lithium and calcium halides
                                                16

 WO 2015/027144                                                         PCT/US2014/052264
would be useful for such an application. These solvents may also be modified through
adjustment of pH either by addition of acidic of basic compounds.
[00079]    The medical devices disclosed herein are preferably biodegradable,
bioerodible, and/or bioresorbable. In a particular embodiment the medical device (for
example as a silk film) can entirely or substantially biodegrade between about 10 days
to about 120 days after implantation.        In another embodiment the medical device (for
example formed as a laminate silk device comprising both a silk film and a knitted silk
fabric) can entirely or substantially biodegrade over a period of time between about 3
years or about 4 years after implantation.
[00080]    Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a silk film having a
transparency and/or translucency. Transparency (also called pellucidity or diaphaneity)
is the physical property of allowing light to pass through a material, whereas
translucency (also called translucence or translucidity) only allows light to pass through
diffusely. The opposite property is opacity. Transparent materials are clear, while
translucent ones cannot be seen through clearly. The silk films disclosed herein may,
or may not, exhibit optical properties such as transparency and translucency. In certain
cases, e.g., superficial line filling, it would be an advantage to have an opaque silk film.
 In other cases such as development of a lens or a "humor" for filling the eye, it would
be an advantage to have a translucent silk film. These properties could be modified by
affecting the structural distribution of the silk film. Factors used to control a hydrogel's
optical properties include, without limitation, silk fibroin concentration, gel crystallinity,
and silk homogeneity.
[00081]    When light encounters a material, it can interact with it in several different
ways. These interactions depend on the nature of the light (its wavelength, frequency,
energy, etc.) and the nature of the material. Light waves interact with an object by
some combination of reflection, and transmittance with refraction. As such, an optically
transparent material allows much of the light that falls on it to be transmitted, with little
light being reflected. Materials which do not allow the transmission of light are called
optically opaque or simply opaque.
[00082]    In an embodiment, a silk film is optically transparent. In aspects of this
embodiment, a silk film transmits, e.g., between about 75% to about 100% of the light.
 In some preferred aspects of this embodiment, a silk film transmits, e.g., between
                                                 17

about 80% to about 90% of the light. In the most preferred aspects of this embodiment,
a silk film transmits, e.g., between about 85% to about 90% of the light.
[00083]      In an embodiment, a silk sponge is optically transparent. In aspects of this
embodiment, a silk sponge transmits, e.g., between about 75% to about 100% of the
light. In some preferred aspects of this embodiment, a silk film transmits, e.g., between
about 80% to about 90% of the light. In the most preferred aspects of this embodiment,
a silk sponge transmits, e.g., between about 85% to about 90% of the light.
[00084]     Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a medical device
comprising a hyaluronan. As used herein, the term "hyaluronic acid" is synonymous
with "HA", "hyaluronic acid", and "hyaluronate" refers to an anionic, non-sulfated
glycosaminoglycan polymer comprising disaccharide units, which themselves include
D-glucuronic      acid  and    D-N-acetylglucosamine     monomers,   linked   together   via
alternating P-1,4 and P-1,3 glycosidic bonds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts
thereof. Hyaluronan can be purified from animal and non-animal sources. Polymers of
hyaluronan can range in size from about 5,000 Da to about 20,000,000 Da. Any
hyaluronan is useful in the compositions disclosed herein with the proviso that the
hyaluronan improves a condition of the skin, such as, e.g., hydration or elasticity. Non
limiting examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of hyaluronan include sodium
hyaluronan, potassium hyaluronan, magnesium hyaluronan, calcium hyaluronan, and
combinations thereof.
[00085]     Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a composition
comprising a crosslinked matrix polymer. As used herein, the term "crosslinked" refers
to the intermolecular physical or chemical bonds joining the individual polymer
molecules, or monomer chains, into a more stable structure like a gel. As such, a
crosslinked matrix polymer has at least one intermolecular physical or chemical bond
joining at least one individual polymer molecule to another one. Matrix polymers
disclosed herein may be chemically crosslinked using dialdehydes and disufides
crosslinking agents including, without limitation, multifunctional PEG-based cross
linking agents, divinyl sulfones, diglycidyl ethers, and bis-epoxides. Non-limiting
examples of hyaluronan crosslinking agents include divinyl sulfone (DVS),               1,4
butanediol diglycidyl ether (BIDDE),        1,2-bis(2,3-epoxypropoxy)ethylene    (EGDGE),
 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane      (DEO),  biscarbodiimide (BCDI),    pentaerythritol tetraglycidyl
                                              18

ether   (PETGE),    adipic dihydrazide    (ADH),   bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate   (BS),
hexamethylenediamine       (HM DA),     1-(2,3-epoxypropyl)-2,3-epoxycyclohexane,      or
combinations thereof.
[00086]    Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a composition
comprising a crosslinked matrix polymer having a degree of crosslinking. As used
herein, the term "degree of crosslinking" refers to the percentage of matrix polymer
monomeric units that are bound to a cross-linking agent, such as, e.g., the
disaccharide monomer units of hyaluronan. Thus, a composition that that has a
crosslinked matrix polymer with a 4% degree of crosslinking means that on average
there are four crosslinking molecules for every 100 monomeric units. Every other
parameter being equal, the greater the degree of crosslinking, the harder the gel
becomes. Non-limiting examples of a degree of crosslinking include about 1 % to about
15%.
[00087]    In an embodiment, a composition comprises an uncrosslinked hyaluronan
where the uncrosslinked hyaluronan comprises a combination of both high molecular
weight hyaluronan and low molecular weight hyaluronan in a ratio of about 20:1, about
15:1, about 10:1, about 5:1, about 1:1, about 1:5 about 1:10, about 1:15, or about 1:20.
[00088]    In  another   embodiment,    a   composition   comprises   an   uncrosslinked
hyaluronan where the uncrosslinked hyaluronan comprises a combination of both high
molecular weight hyaluronan and low molecular weight hyaluronan, in various ratios.
As used herein, the term "high molecular weight hyaluronan" refers to a hyaluronan
polymer that has a molecular weight of 1,000,000 Da or greater. Non-limiting examples
of a high molecular weight hyaluronan include a hyaluronan of about 1,500,000 Da, a
hyaluronan of about 2,000,000 Da, a hyaluronan of about 2,500,000 Da, a hyaluronan
of about 3,000,000 Da, a hyaluronan of about 3,500,000 Da, a hyaluronan of about
4,000,000 Da, a hyaluronan of about 4,500,000 Da, and a hyaluronan of about
5,000,000 Da. As used herein, the term "low molecular weight hyaluronan" refers to a
hyaluronan polymer that has a molecular weight of less than 1,000,000 Da. Non
limiting examples of a low molecular weight hyaluronan include a hyaluronan of about
200,000 Da, a hyaluronan of about 300,000 Da, a hyaluronan of about 400,000 Da, a
hyaluronan of about 500,000 Da, a hyaluronan of about 600,000 Da, a hyaluronan of
                                            19

                                          EXAMPLES
[00091]      The following examples illustrate embodiments of the present invention.
                                           Example 1
           Preparation of a Silk Based Biomaterial useful as an Adhesion Barrier
The materials used in this Example 1 to make a silk based biomaterial useful as an
adhesion barrier included: an aqueous silk fibroin solution (7-12% w/v concentration of
silk); sterile 60-mm Petri dishes (used as casting molds); ethanol solution 90% v/v, and;
a knitted silk fabric (the particular knitted silk fabric used was SERI Surgical Scaffold.
SERI@ Surgical Scaffold is available from Allergan, Inc., Irvine, California).           SERI@
Surgical Scaffold is an embodiment of the knitted silk medical devices set forth in US
patent applications serial numbers 13/715,872; 13/587,040; 13/843,519; 13/088,706,
and; 12/680,404.
[00092]      As a first step to obtain a solution of water-soluble silk fibroin, either Bombyx
Mori silk cocoons or silk fibroin yarn made by processing Bombyx Mori silk cocoons
were soaked in a warm basic solution to thereby remove the immunogenic protein
sericin naturally present on the silkworm silk.         The sericin depleted silk was then
digested (solubilized) by dissolving the sericin depleted silk in 9.3M LiBr followed by
dialysis into an aqueous solution. The amino acid composition of Bombyx Mori silk
fibroin shows a low amount of aspartic acid/glutamic acid (carboxylic groups), even
lower amount of lysine (amine groups) and a high amount of serine (hydroxyl groups).
Silk beta-sheet formation can be induced with accelerants (pH, temperature, vortexing,
sonication, ethanol treatment, etc.).
[00093]      A first device was made as follows. Silk fibroin solution (1 ml) was cast on
the bottom of an inverted 60 mm Petri dish and allowed to dry between 2-12 hours (
                                                21

 WO 2015/027144                                                        PCT/US2014/052264
see Figure 1).      The dried films were then immersed for two 2 hours in the ethanol
solution to induce beta-sheet formation in the silk.
[00094]      A second device was made as follows. Silk fibroin films cast as described
above were allowed to dry for 50 minutes in a laminar flow hood then, prior to complete
drying of the surface, were overlayed with precut SERI@ Surgical Scaffold meshes (4x5
cm) (see Figure 2). The film was allowed to fuse with the mesh for 2-12 hours, then the
construct was immersed in ethanol solution for 2 hours to induce physical crosslinking
via beta sheets.
[00095]      For both devices made in this Example 1, the ability of silk to become water
resistant by physical crosslinking of the silk molecules was made use of. Through this
cross linking process, the silk fibroin protein underwent structural rearrangements to a
beta-sheet rich conformation. Temperature, pH, ionic strength and treatment with polar
agents such as alcohols are all factors known to induce such structural transitions. For
the two devices made in this Example 1, beta sheet formation was induced via ethanol
treatment (see Figure 3).
[00096]      The first device was a monolayer of transparent water-resistant silk film, as
shown by Figure 4. The thickness of the film was controllable and depended on the
silk fibroin solution concentration and the casting area. We found that an 8% w/v silk
fibroin solution cast on a 4.6 cm diameter mold would yield a 50 Pm tick film. The film
was pliable, moldable, stretchable, with good mechanical integrity (average maximum
load of 8.8±1.9 N for a 50 pm thick film versus an average maximum load of 71.7±1.0
N of SERI@ Surgical Scaffold) and can be used to wrap the target tissue (i.e. tendon) to
isolate it from the surrounding tissues to with it may non-specifically adhere (Figure 5).
Additionally, the first device can be used in conjunction with other devices (meshes,
sheets). Moreover, the transparency of device 1 is a convenient feature as it allows the
user to correctly evaluate the positioning of the device 1 film on the tissue.
[00097]      The second device made in this Example 1 consisted of a single layer silk
film fused with the SERI@ Surgical Scaffold (see Figure 6). The fusion of the silk with
the mesh was driven by the partial encasing of the mesh filaments by the silk solution
prior its complete drying (Figure 7). After complete drying of the film the construct was
treated with ethanol solution to render it water insoluble via beta-sheet formation. The
key features of this second device were: (a) - its smooth surface on one side and (b)
                                             22

 WO 2015/027144                                                       PCT/US2014/052264
the rugged surface provided by the mesh pores on the other side. In the case of the
abdominal wall repair for example, the smooth side is intended to contact the bowel
and prevent adhesion formations, while the rugged surface will face the abdominal wall
and will integrate well with the surrounding tissue by promoting cells to adhere to its
groove (Figure 8).
[00098]    Both device 1 and device 2 have the advantage of being both entirely silk
fibroin based. The sterility of both these devices can be ensured either by using
autoclaved silk fibroin solution for film casting (and fusing them with sterile meshed for
device 2) or via ethylene oxide sterilization. Moreover, both devices are compatible to
be used with a variety of other mesh medical such as Vicryl and Mersilene. These
devices: (a) - are biocompatible and do not intrinsically sustain cell attachment as
previously established by large bodies of scientific literature; (b) - provide a smooth
surface that further hinders cell attachment; (c) - do not contain any "foreign" chemical
agents; (d) - are physically crosslinked through intra- and inter-molecular beta-sheets;
and (e) - are robust, drapable and easy to handle.
                                          Example 2
                          Self Adherent Silk based Biomaterials
[00099]    The materials used in this Example 2 included: an aqueous silk fibroin
solution (7-12% w/v) made by the same methods set forth in Example 2; sterile 60-mm
Petri dishes (used as casting molds), and; an ethanol solution 90% v/v.
[000100] Silk fibroin solution (8% w/v, 1 ml) was cast on the bottom of two inverted 60
mm Petri dish and allowed to dry between 2-12 hours. Half of the films were then
immersed for 2 hours in ethanol solution to induce beta-sheet formation. Subsequently,
the ethanol treated films were rinsed with deionized water and repositioned on the
molds. The remaining films ( non-treated, water soluble silk films) were then deposited
on top of the wet ethanol treated films and the double layered films was allowed to air
dry for 2-12 hours (Figure 9). Alternatively, a second layer of silk fibroin solution was
deposited on top of the ethanol treated films, then allowed to dry, to yield the double
layered self-adherent films.
                                              23

 WO 2015/027144                                                         PCT/US2014/052264
[000101] This Example 2 also made use of silk's natural ability to become water
resistant via physical crosslinking. Through this process, the silk fibroin protein
undergoes structural rearrangements to a beta-sheet rich conformation. Temperature,
pH, ionic strength and treatment with polar agents such as alcohols are all factors
known to induce such structural transitions. For the device made in this Example 2,
beta sheet formation was induced via ethanol treatment (Figure 10).
[000102] The devices made were smooth, double layered, self-adherent silk film
consisting of a waterproof, physically crosslinked side and a water soluble, adherent
side. The adhesiveness of the water soluble silk film is responsible for the
cohesiveness of the double layered constructs as it intimately blended with the surface
of the ethanol treated film. The dried device can be easily handled with dried gloves or
hands. When applied to a wet or moist surface, the water soluble side of construct
rehydrates and tightly adheres to the contact surface (Figure 11). The ethanol treated
side then provides a beta sheet rich, waterproof barrier.
[000103] The film adherence mechanism probably implies structural rearrangements
of the silk fibroin in which the hydrophilic regions of the protein get oriented toward and
interact with the hydrophilic regions of the contact surface and analogously, the
hydrophobic regions of the protein re-orient toward and interact with the hydrophobic,
beta sheet rich interface of the ethanol treated silk film (Figure 12).
The device can be used for example in: (a) - hemostasis (by attaching it or by
juxtaposing it to bleeding blood vessels) ; (b) - wound dressing (by attaching it or by
juxtaposing it to superficial wounds); (c) - burn dressings (by substituting skin grafts) ;
(d) - small defect repair patch (by patching small defects such a tympanic membrane
holes); (e) - tissue enforcing/supporting patch (by wrapping it against weakened
tissues, i.e. cervix to prevent pre-term deliveries); or (f) - post-operative adhesion
barrier (by attaching it to the affected tissue with the "sticky' side, then the waterproof
side would serve as a barrier to attachment to surrounding tissues). The versatility of
this device is further highlighted by its transparency - which would enhance the ability
to control the exact placement of the device; ease of sterilization - since it can be
sterilely manufactured from autoclaved silk fibroin solution; control over the thickness
and mechanical strength - since these parameters are dictated by the concentration of
                                              24

manufacturing process.

                     Use of Silk Medical Device in Abdominal Surgery
[000104] Briefly, a hernia is a bulge of intestine, another organ, or fat through the
muscles of the abdomen, where tissue structure and function is lost at the load-bearing
muscle, tendon and fascial layer. Thus, a hernia can occur when there is weakness in
the muscle wall that allows part of an internal organ to push through. The silk medical
device within the scope of the present invention can be used to assist in the repair of
an inguinal (inner groin), incisional (resulting from an incision), femoral (outer groin),
umbilical (belly button), or hiatal (upper stomach) hernia, using either an open or
laproscopic technique. A ventral hernia is a type of abdominal hernia - it can develop
as a defect at birth, resulting from incomplete closure of part of the abdominal wall, or
develop where an incision was made during an abdominal surgery, occurring when the
incision doesn't heal properly.
[000105] A silk medical device within the scope of the present invention can be used
in both open and laparoscopic procedures to assist in the repair of a ventral hernia as
follows: the patient lies on the operating table, either flat on the back or on the side,
depending on the location of the hernia. General anesthesia is usually given, though
some patients can have local or regional anesthesia, depending on the location of the
hernia and complexity of the repair. A catheter is inserted into the bladder to remove
urine and decompress the bladder. If the hernia is near the stomach, a gastric (nose or
mouth to stomach) tube can be inserted to decompress the stomach. In an open
procedure, an incision is made just large enough to remove fat and scar tissue from the
abdominal wall near the hernia. The outside edges of the weakened hernial area are
defined and excess tissue removed from within the area. The silk medical device is
then applied so that it overlaps the weakened area by several inches (centimeters) in
all directions.   Non-absorbable sutures are placed into the full thickness of the
abdominal wall. The sutures are tied down and knotted.
[000106] In the less-invasive laparoscopic procedure, two or three small incisions are
made to access the hernia site - the laparoscope is inserted in one incision and
                                             25

surgical instruments in the others to remove tissue and place the silk medical device in
the same fashion as in an open procedure. Significantly less abdominal wall tissue is
removed in laparoscopic repair. The surgeon views the entire procedure on a video
monitor to guide the placement and suturing of the silk medical device.
                                        Example 4
                             Anti-Adhesive Silk Medical Devices
This Example 4 details the experiments we carried out to make and characterize
various multi-component, multilayer or fused layers silk (or silk based) medical devices
("the device" or "the devices"). The devices we made are intended for implantation in
humans or other mammals in a surgical or medical procedure, such as in a hernia
repair surgical procedure, to assist in the repair and/or support of various soft tissues
and prevent, or at least substantial reduce, adhesion formation onto the implanted
devices or to adjacent tissues. Soft tissue can be tissues that connect, support, or
surround other structures and organs of a mammalian (and in particular a human)
body, such as tendons, ligaments, fascia, skin, fibrous tissues, fat, synovial
membranes, connective tissue, muscles, nerves, blood vessels, as well as various soft
tissue organs such as the breast.
The device is preferably made as a flat sheet. The device can comprise one layer or
several layers of material. One layer or one side (i.e. the front) of the device is made of
silk or is silk based, for example it is made of sericin extracted, knitted, silk fibroin yarn.
When the device comprises only one layer of material the back or bottom side of the
device has an adhesive property. When the device comprises two layers, the second
layer on the opposite (i.e. the back side of the second layer) side of the device
(attached to or fused the bottom side of the first layer) has the anti-adhesive property.
The first layer can be and is preferably a silk fabric, such as SERI@ Surgical Scaffold
(available from Allergan, Inc., Irvine, California).    The anti-adhesive property of the
second layer of a two layer device prevents the second layer once the device is
abdominally implanted (or subsequent to the implantation of the device where the
second layer is a sacrificial layer) facing the bowel, from attaching (or adhering) to the
bowel.

WO 2015/027144                                                          PCT/US2014/052264
The two layer devices are made by a multiple-step fabrication process, and can
comprise a silk film or a silk fabric or mesh (a suitable and preferred silk fabric is SERI®
Surgical Scaffold), as a first layer of the device, attached to a second layer which
second layer forms an anti-adhesive barrier layer (when this version of the second
layer faces the bowel the second layer is made of a biomaterial that does not promote
cell attachment and proliferation).
Thus, as explained above the silk medical devices we developed have an anti
adhesive property either because the second layer does not promote cell attachment
and proliferation or because the second layer is a sacrificial layer.
In this Example 4:
*   we carried out two in vitro cell screening assays to determine characteristics of
various biomaterial substrates to use as the second layer of the device;
* three devices comprising oxidized regenerated cellulose ("ORC") as the second
were made and characterized in vivo;
* we made fourteen devices;
*   we tested in vitro devices which comprised a silk film ("SF") and a hyaluronic acid
("HA"), an alginate ("ALG"), dextran sulfate ("DS"), a polyethylene glycol ("PEG") or
Pluronico F127 ("F127"), and;
* we made use of film casting and sponge casting technologies, as well an e-beam
sterilization technique.
Table 1 shows the second layer materials (for a two or multi-layer device) we
examined. Further details of each of these materials are provided in this Example 4.

Selection of Anti-Adhesive Layer
 An in vitro biomaterial screening experiment was carried out to:
    -    rapidly evaluate the anti-adherence capacities of a large number of materials;
    -    identify the most effective anti-adhesive material, and;
    -    limit the number of devices tested in vivo.
This in vitro screening process involved the use of primary human fibroblasts ("the
cells", which are similar to the cells present at injury/surgery sites), and assessment of
cell attachment, phenotype, proliferation and overall cell health, when cultured on
different biomaterials. Thus our screening for suitable anti-adhesive material involved

two main components: (a) the cells and (b) substrate biomaterials (the second layer).
Additionally, the screening process was designed to allow the microscopical evaluation
of the cells. For this purpose, we chose to prepare and evaluate the selected
biomaterials (the second layer) as thin films, cast in wells of multi-well tissue culture
plates. Although generally substrates can be presented to cells in a variety of physical
forms such as gels, films, sponges, spheroids, etc., for our purpose it was considered
that evaluation of cells on thin films was:
    *  reflective of the cellular responses to formulation components
    *  conveniently allow for microscopic cell phenotype evaluation because a light
beam can easily pass through films
    *  served the purpose of the pre-screening process by differentiating between

Cell culture
Primary human adult fibroblasts (HDFs) were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (the ATCC, Manassas, Virginia USA 20110) and cell cultures were initiated
as per the ATCC instructions provided.      Briefly, fibroblast specific cell culture media
was prepared in the laminar flow hood, then the cell vial was thawed in a water bath at
370C for 1 minute. The cell suspension was then transferred to a T75 culture flask that
contained 25 ml of culture medium. Cells were then incubated at 370C and 5% CO2
and the culture medium was changed every 72 h until cells were needed for assays or
became -80%        confluent. When confluent, cells were subcultured in new flasks. Cells
were propagated for a maximum of 6 passages throughout the duration of the study
(HDFs have a maximum cycle of 10 propagations).
Biomaterial (second layer) casting methods
   Biomaterial films were prepared in the laminar flow hood from sterile filtered
solutions, as described in Table 3. The solution concentrations used were chosen
based on practical reasons:
   * The SF preparation process typically yields solutions with a silk concentration of
6-8% v/w.     Higher of silk in the solution concentrations can be obtained by further
processing, however, silk fibroin solution gels rapidly at concentrations over 8% v/v
which make its handling difficult.
   *   HA is a polymeric material with good aqueous solubility, however at
concentrations over 2% w/v the solutions are highly viscous which makes their
handling difficult
   * ALG is similar to HA, therefore we chose to use both these polysaccharides at
2% w/v
   *   DS and PEG yielded low viscosity solutions at 10% w/v - higher concentrations
would produce more viscous solutions that could not be sterile filtered
                                            31

WO 2015/027144                                                           PCT/US2014/052264
    *    F127 has a critical gel transition temperature at 250C when used at 20% w/v,
therefore this was chosen as stock concentration
    Overall,      the intent of this experiment was to have the working solution as
concentrated as possible while keeping the viscosities at level that permitted pipetting,
sterile filtration and transfer.
    The volume ratios chosen for formulation screening were based on the need to
obtain silk based solutions that would be physically crosslinkable via beta sheet
interactions. This requirement ensures that the final scaffolds would not readily
dissolved when placed in an aqueous environment and that no chemical crosslinkers
are used in the process.
    The film volumes (200 pl/well) was chosen based on the well area - this volume
ensures uniform surface coverage while eliminating capillary tension effect (thicker film
edges, thin film centers).       It also provided minimal interference with the microscope
light beam.
    The crosslinking of the films prepared was performed with ethanol.           For alginate
based films, CaC12 was added to ethanol, as alginate gels in the presence of Ca2' but
is soluble in ethanol. HA, DS, PEG and F127 are also soluble in ethanol, however the
SF crosslinking process entraps these macromolecules in the silk network even though
some nano- and micro- scale heterogeneity arises in films because of the differential
solubility of the components. The crosslinking solution volume (0.5 ml was chosen
based on the volume of the tissue culture plate wells.
    The biomaterial films were prepared as shown in Table 2.

Film surface investigation
For the screening of biomaterials             biological effects, the following biomaterials
formulations were evaluated: SF; SF/HA (1:1; 2:1 and 3:1 v/v), ALG, SF/ALG (1:1; 2:1
and 3:1 v/v), SF/DS (8:1 v/v), SF/PEG (8:1 v/v), F127, SF/F127 (8:1 v/v). The 1:1 ratios
were be well stabilized via SF crosslinking.               However, higher SF content in the
formulation conferred higher aqueous stability to the final formulation.                    For this we
tested formulations with gradually increasing silk amounts. The surfaces of films cast
as above were investigated microscopically at 1OOX magnification.
SF films had a smooth surface with cracks that originated most likely during the
physical crosslinking process. SF/HA formulations showed a heterogeneous surface,
most likely due to the fact that HA is insoluble in ethanol and tends to fall out of solution
during the physical crosslinking process of silk. ALG (alginate) undergoes crosslinking
in the presence of Ca2 . This caused the film to wrinkle and detach form the edges of
the well. Due to the presence of the ethanol, needed to ensure similar treatment of all
wells and also as an added measure of sterility, some amounts of alginate appeared to
fall out of solution, similar to HA.      SF/ALG formulations showed a heterogeneous
surface, most likely due to the fact that ALG is insoluble in ethanol and tends to fall out
                                                 33

 WO 2015/027144                                                       PCT/US2014/052264
of solution during the physical crosslinking process of silk. SF/PEG films were smooth
due to the presence of PEG, which acts as a plasticizer and reduces the inter- and
intra-molecular tension between silk molecules during the physical crosslinking
process. The
SF/DS films were smooth with some crater-like irregularities, most likely generated by
the differences in solubility between SF and DS. F127 poloxamer, at concentrations of
 15% w/v and above, gels at room temperature and showed a smooth surface. F127 is
however soluble in ethanol and some material most likely washed off during the
ethanol treatment. The SF/F127          films surfaces were heterogeneous. F127 was
expected to act as plasticizer, however the differences in solubility between SF and
F127 are probably the cause for the observed surface irregularities.
 Cell Attachment Evaluation
 In the context of the development of a device with or with a layer of the device that has
an anti-adhesive property, cell attachment was evaluated as a primary indicator of the
device or the layer's anti-adhesive efficiency (the lower the cell attachment the better
the anti-adhesive properties of the biomaterial).       Primary human dermal fibroblasts
(adult, HDF) passage 5 were cultured on the biomaterial films made at a density of
2x10 5 cells/ml    corresponding to 5000 cells/well in 250pl culture medium. The cell
seeding concentration was chosen based on the culture surface area, the HDF
proliferation  pattern   observed   during cell    culturing  and assay duration     (slow
proliferating cells would be seeded at high numbers, while fast proliferating cells would
be seeded at low numbers to avoid contact inhibition issues at longer than 24 h (hour)
assay time points). Cell morphology and attachment were visually assessed after 24
hours and 6 days incubation.
On the tissue culture plate ("TCP") control , HDFs show the fibroblast specific, spindle
shaped morphology, both at 24 h and at 6 days. The 6 day data revealed a healthy cell
phenotype with good proliferation. This data set represented our positive control:
because the TCP surface is designed to support and promote cell attachment and
viability (ATCC      animal cell  culture guide).      For all our anti-adhesive device
formulations, we targeted lower cell attachment than that observed on the TCP.
                                              34

 WO 2015/027144                                                           PCT/US2014/052264
The 24 h data images were representative for the observed phenotypes on the entire
film surface and revealed atypical fibroblast phenotypes on all formulations, with SF,
SF/PEG and SF/DS films still induced elongated, somewhat spindle-like phenotypes,
but the overall cell morphology was different than on TCP showing that cell attachment
was impaired, as desired. SF/HA and SF/ALG prevented cell attachment to the point
where cells were rounded and clustered together.
The 6 day data revealed further cellular changes. On SF, cells were covering the
surface unevenly and were anchored to                few attachment points most probably
corresponding to cracks in the film surface. This showed that SF enhanced anti
adhesive properties compared to the TCP.               On SF/HA some cell spreading was
noticed, however the surface coverage appeared to be less than the TCP control, as
estimated via microscopic evaluation. SF/ALG and SF/DS prevented cell spreading
and a few rounded cell clusters were observed on the surface of these biomaterials.
Significantly, all the biomaterial formulations we made and evaluated showed
decreased cell attachment and surface coverage as compared to the TCP control.
This showed that each of the chosen second layer materials evaluated can be used as
the anti-adhesive layer of the device.       It is important to note that although referred to
above as a second layer, the biomaterials used were in fact fused to the silk film layer
(SF) used. The anti-adhesive second layer can alternately be attached or fused to a
first layer which is in the form of a silk fabric or a silk mesh.
 Cell Viability Assay
The cell attachment assay offered a visual assessment of the desired anti
adhesive/cell-repellant properties of different biomaterial formulations. In addition to
this feature, it was important to evaluate the actual effects of SF and the second layer
materials ("additives" or "biomaterials") on cell viability.
The cytocompatibility of biomaterials was evaluated after 48 h and 6 day incubation
period. For this, a LIVE/DEAD cytotoxicity kit was used. This kit has two components:
fluorescein (green fluorescence) - a dye that binds to the membrane of intact, live cells;
and ethidium homodimer (red fluorescence) - a nucleic acid specific dye that binds to
                                                35

WO 2015/027144                                                        PCT/US2014/052264
the nucleus of damaged/dead cells, but cannot permeate the membrane of healthy
cells.
Post-plating, the duration of cell attachment is dependent on the cell type and
substrate, and might take up to 24 h to complete (ATCC animal cell culture guide).
Therefore, the 48 h time point was chosen as it is the earliest point that would allow
evaluation of substrate related cytotoxic effects after cell attachment has occurred. The
6 day time point was chosen to evaluate the longer term cytocompatibility of the
substrates as the potential effects of additive leaching was expected to be detectable at
this time point (after 6 days, cells on some substrates reached confluence, therefore
we chose not to investigate later time points). Cell viability on TCP was used as the
positive control.
At both time points all the second layer films we had prepared showed minimal
cytotoxic effects, with cell viability exceeding 95% as determined by microscopic
evaluation. The only second layer material the appeared to induce cell death was
pluronic F127 as stand-alone formulation. We also noted that based on the substrate
(second layer) formulations,      the cells had different phenotypes - a more rounded
appearance indicative of        lower attachment while a spindle-like phenotype was
indicative of better attachment, comparable to the control.
In summary, the cytocompatibility assay showed that all the tested second layers were
cytocompatible and did not induce cell death. This showed that SF and the tested
additives (the second layer materials) can be used in the device.
Cell Proliferation Assay
Another method we used to evaluate the affinity of cells to a surface and the cell
substrate interaction was to perform a cell proliferation assay (MTS assay). This assay
relied on the cell mediated enzymatic reduction of a soluble methyl tetrazolium salt
(MTS) to its reduced, colored format, therefore eliminating the possibility of any
artifacts or false positives. This enzymatic reduction process gave a direct correlation
between the number of living cells on a surface and the color intensity of the reduced
MTS.
                                             36

 WO 2015/027144                                                        PCT/US2014/052264
The cell numbers present on the screened biomaterial surfaces were evaluated at 48 h
and 6 days post incubation. The 48 h time point was chosen as an early indicator of
cellular affinity to the films, however the 6 day readings were more representative since
the assay is sensitive to the overall cell number and yields better results for higher cell
densities, such as those observed at later incubation time points (Figure 13). At 48 h,
the A450 values were lower than those observed at 6 days. This was consistent with a
lower initial cell number/well correlating with attachment differences. As attached cells
proliferate and their number increases in the test well, when assayed, the intensity of
the colorimetric reagent increases and this translates into higher A450 values, as seen
at day 6. Nevertheless, the 48 h and 6 day data trends correlated well and supported
earlier observations indicating that all screened biomaterial formulations (the second
layer) showed anti-adhesive potential as cell attachment was           5 50% lower on all
formulations compared to the TCP control.
Device Formulation Screening
The results of the aforementioned cell screening data showed that the chosen
formulations (second layer materials) had the desirable anti-adhesive feature.         We
wished to minimize the amount of additives (second layer material) in order to maintain
the silk (first layer) characteristic physical crosslinking and to avoid any potential or
unknown negative interactions these might cause so we therefore additionally
screened the formulations (second layer materials) with increased silk content. For SF
as the first layer with five different second layer materials, Table 3 summarizes the five
tested SF/additive formulations and the results are illustrated in the five Figure 14 bar
graphs.

cell number (MTS assay).       A higher cell seeding density was chosen for this short
duration assay in order to maximize assay sensitivity. For SF/HA formulations, the data
showed that the 3:1 volume ratio yielded the best biological outcome (equivalent to the
lowest cell concentration) and that decreasing the HA amount in the formulation can
increase cell adhesion.      However, during the device casting, the sponge surface
appeared to shed upon rubbing.       Therefore, a 10:1 SF to HA ratio was chosen for
device evaluation since it was the highest HA containing formulation that yielded a
robust sponge surface. For SF/ALG the 20:1 ratio yielded similar biological effects to
higher ALG ratios, therefore devices were prepared with 20:1 SF to ALG. For SF/PEG
the 8:1 ratio produced the best biological outcomes, therefore devices were prepared
with 8:1 SF to PEG. For SF/F127, when F127 was used at 10% w/v concentration, the
cell adherence was similar on all formulations. When 20% w/v F127 was used, at an
8:1 volume ratio, the cell repellent effects were more pronounced than for its 10% w/v
counterpart. However, because of cytotoxicity concerns as evident from cells seeded
pure F127, devices were made with 8:1 SF to F127 (10% w/v). For SF/DS, the tested
formulations elicited a clear dose response, with cell attachment being the lowest in the
presence of the highest amount of DS (corresponding to the 8:1 SF/DS formulation). In
our assays DS showed good biocompatibility.             Since all ratios were more anti
adhesive than the SF control, we made devices with a 15:1 SF to DS ratio, to minimize
the amount of additive but still maintain the significantly increased anti-adherent
properties.

General Considerations
The devices were with the second layers selected based on the results set forth above.
Depending on the properties, some formulations were prepared as films and some as
sponges. Biomaterial (second layer) mixes that yielded homogeneous formulations,
with good pliability were cast as films (SF/PEG and SF/F127), while based on the same
considerations, sponges appeared to be a more suitable option for heterogeneous
materials such as SF/HA, SF/ ALG and SF/DS. Films fused with silk mesh were easily
sutured as films and were transparent, however the sponges fused with silk mesh
appeared to have more robustness during handling (film devices can delaminate when
crumpled in hand, while crumpling was not an issue with the sponges made). For
certain devices made additional composition adjustment were made to improve their
processability.
For sterilization, some devices were processed dry, with ethylene oxide, while other
were processed moist, with e-beam sterilization. The intent was to sterilize all samples
dry, however, with film and certain sponges, drying caused curling and cracking of the
scaffold. Based on this, we chose to process films and sponges moist, sealed in
pouches with moisture barrier. Since ethylene oxide cannot be used with such
pouches, samples were processed via e-beam treatment. The sterilization of all
devices was performed with standard sterilization cycles and parameters and no
additional sterility control was performed on any of the devices.
Process
Device 1
Description: SERI* Surgical Scaffold fused with Surgicel@ SNoW (ORC) (6x6 cm)
Execution:     Sterile SERI* Surgical Scaffolds were cut in the laminar flow hood with
sterile stainless steel scissors into 6 x 6 cm squares. Similarly, Surgicel@ SNoW were
cut in the laminar flow hood with sterile stainless steel scissors into 6 x 6 cm squares.
Autoclaved silk fibroin solution (c = 7.5% w/v) was used to mount Surgicel SNoW onto
the mesh. Specifically, 2 ml of silk solution were added to the lid of a sterile 100 cm
Petri dish and was evenly spread with a sterile pipette tip. The mesh was then placed
in the dish until its surface was uniformly wet. The mesh was transferred onto a
                                             41

 WO 2015/027144                                                    PCT/US2014/052264
Surgicel SNoW square and pressed down with sterile tweezers for 1 minute. All
assembled devices were then allowed to dry for 1 h in the laminar flow hood then
ethanol treated (100% v/v) for 30 minutes. The ethanol was then allowed to evaporate
and devices were individually washed with 150 ml of sterile PBS. The washing step
was done by using a vacuum filtration flask - the device was laid flat on the top filter,
the filter was connected to vacuum and 15 ml of PBS were poured onto the device. The
vacuum helped remove most of the PBS from the devices. The prototypes were then
further dried on the laminar flow hood for 12 h in partially covered sterile rectangular
plates (OmniTrays).
Sterilization: these devices were assembled in the laminar flow hood from sterile
starting materials. No additional sterilization was performed.
Packaging/Storage: Devices prepared as above were places in autoclaved containers
and covered with sterile PBS. They were kept under ambient conditions for 24 h before
use.
Testing: Device 1 was used as "wet lab" material to consolidate the surgical procedure.
No additional testing was performed.
Observations: partial delamination of the two layers was observed for some of the
device 1 samples made.
Device 1A
Description: SERI* Surgical Scaffold sewn with Surgicel@ SNoW (ORC) (6x6 cm)
Execution:    Non-sterile SERI* Surgical Scaffolds were cut with sterile stainless steel
scissors into 6 x 6 cm squares. Similarly, Surgicel@ SNoW were cut under non-sterile
conditions with stainless steel scissors into 6 x 6 cm squares. For each device one
mesh square was sewn with a sewing machine to one SNoW square by using
extracted 9-filament silk yarn.
Sterilization: devices were placed in self-sealing pouches and ethylene oxide (EO)
sterilized.

Packaging/Storage: Devices 1A prepared             were placed in self-sealing sterilization
pouches, were EO sterilized then aerated for at least 3 day prior use. During the
aeration period, devices were kept under environmental conditions.
Testing: Prototype 1A was tested in vivo
Device 2
Description: SERI@ Surgical Scaffold fused with Surgicel@ NuKnit (ORC) (6x6 cm)
Execution:     Sterile SERI@ Surgical Scaffolds were cut in the laminar flow hood with
sterile stainless steel scissors into 6 x 6 cm squares. Similarly, Surgicel@ NuKnit were
cut in the laminar flow hood with sterile stainless steel scissors into 6 x 6 cm squares.
Autoclaved silk fibroin solution (c = 7.5% w/v) was used to mount Surgicel NuKnit
(patterned side up) onto the mesh. Specifically, 1 ml of silk solution was added to the
lid of a sterile 100 cm Petri dish and was evenly spread with a sterile pipette tip (the
amount of silk used for fusing the two layers was reduced to 1 ml in this case as
dipping of the mesh into 2 ml of silk caused wetting of NuKnit and impaired the fusion
of the layers). The mesh was then placed in the dish until its surface was uniformly wet.
The mesh was transferred onto a NuKnit square and pressed down by rolling the
bottom of a Petri dish on its side. All assembled devices were then allowed to dry for 1
h in the laminar flow hood then ethanol treated (100% v/v) for 30 minutes. The ethanol
was then allowed to evaporated and devices were individually washed with 150 ml of
sterile PBS. The washing step was done by using a vacuum filtration flask - the device
was laid flat on the top filter, the filter was connected to vacuum and 15 ml were poured
onto the device. The vacuum helped remove most of the PBS from the devices. The
prototypes were then further dried on the laminar flow hood for 12 h in partially covered
sterile rectangular plates (OmniTrays).
Sterilization: these devices were assembled in the laminar flow hood from sterile
starting materials. No additional sterilization was performed.
Packaging/Storage: Devices prepared as above were places in autoclaved containers
(see image above) and covered with sterile PBS. They were kept under ambient
conditions for 24 h before use.

 WO 2015/027144                                                     PCT/US2014/052264
Testing: Prototype 2 was used as "wet lab" material to consolidate the surgical
procedure. No additional testing was performed.
Observations: partial delamination of the two layers was observed for some of the
Device 2 samples.
Device 2A
Description: SERI@ Surgical Scaffold sewn with Surgicel@ NuKnit (ORC) (6x6 cm)
Execution:    Non-sterile SERI@ Surgical Scaffolds were cut with sterile stainless steel
scissors into 6 x 6 cm squares. Similarly, Surgicel@ NuKnit were cut under non-sterile
conditions with stainless steel scissors into 6 x 6 cm squares. Based on the tightly knit
pattern of the ORC, the sacrificial layer of Prototype 2A is expected to degrade slower
than that of Prototype 1A. For each device one mesh square was sewn with a sewing
machine to one NuKnit square (patterned side up) by using extracted 9-filament silk
yarn.
Sterilization: devices were placed in self-sealing pouches and ethylene oxide (EO)
sterilized.
Packaging/Storage: Devices prepared as above were placed in self-sealing sterilization
pouches, were EO sterilized then aerated for at least 3 day prior use.
Testing: Device 2A was tested in vivo.
Device 3
Description: SERI@ Surgical Scaffold sewn with Surgicel@ Fibrillar (2 sheets) and
Surgicel@ Original (ORC) (6x6 cm)
Execution:    Non-sterile SERI@ Surgical Scaffolds were cut with sterile stainless steel
scissors into 6 x 6 cm squares. Similarly, Surgicel@ Fibrillar and Surgicel@ Original
                                            44

 WO 2015/027144                                                       PCT/US2014/052264
were cut under non-sterile conditions with       stainless steel scissors into 7 x 7 cm
squares. For each device one mesh square was sewn with a sewing machine to two
sheets of Surgicel@ Fibrillar and topped with one layer of Surgicel@ Original by using
extracted 9-filament silk yarn. The combination of the two ORC materials ensured a
thicker sacrificial layer that could potentially degrade at a slower rate than that of
Device 1A or Device 2A. The assembled device was then trimmed to a size of 6x6 cm.
Sterilization: devices were placed in self-sealing pouches and ethylene oxide (EO)
sterilized.
Packaging/Storage: Devices prepared as above were placed in self-sealing sterilization
pouches, were EO sterilized then aerated for at least 3 day prior use.
Testing: Device 2A was tested in vivo.
Device 4 and Device 5 were silk based control devices (SBR-202 and SERI 3D).
Device 6
Description: SERI@ Surgical Scaffold fused with SF/PEG film (6x6 cm)
Execution: Non-sterile SERI@ Surgical Scaffolds were cut with stainless steel scissors
into 6 x 6 cm squares. Separately, silk fibroin solution (c = 8.1 % w/v) was mixed with
PEG (c = 10% w/v) in a 8:1 volume ratio then the mix was homogenized by pipetting up
and down. The solution (8 ml) was cast in 10 cm square Petri dish bottoms and dried in
the vacuum oven for 18 h. Dried films in dishes were then treated with 6 ml of ethanol
(100% v/v) for 5 min. Films were then removed from dishes and briefly hydrated by a 5
second dip in deionized water, followed by 5 second dip in 90% v/v ethanol.
Subsequently, films were placed face down (the side that was exposed to air during
drying) and stretched on the lid of a 100 mm Petri dish then allowed to dry flat with a
Petri dish bottom and a lead ring sitting on top.
Silk fibroin solution (c = 8.1% w/v) was used to mount the mesh onto the films ("c"
means "concentration"). Specifically, 2 ml of silk solution were added to the lid of a
sterile 100 cm Petri dish and were evenly spread with a sterile pipette tip. The mesh
was placed in the dish until its surface was uniformly wet. The mesh was then added

 WO 2015/027144                                                            PCT/US2014/052264
onto the dried film and smoothed down with gloved fingers to ensure uniform surface
attachment. The constructs were dried flat with the bottom of a 100mm Petri dish and
a lead ring resting on top for 15 minutes. The devices were then placed in 90% ethanol
for 10 minutes, blotted, then placed in deionized water for 5 minutes for first wash. After
the first wash, films were trimmed down to the size of the 6x6cm mesh and then placed
into second wash for 5 minutes.            The devices were washed one more time then
pouched.
Sterilization:   the devices were placed in metallized peelable polyester polyethylene
film (MMPE) and paper polyethylene foil polyethylene barrier (PPFP) pouches, sealed
using Accu-Seal Sealer Model 630, and e-beam sterilized.
Packaging/Storage: The devices prepared as above were placed in PPFP pouches,
heat sealed and e-beam sterilized. The devices were then kept in pouches and stored.
Testing: The devices in both MMPE and PPFP pouches were examined two weeks
after sterilization for overall integrity, delamination, pliability and suturability.
Observations: Films remained moist during and after sterilization. Devices appeared to
have good pliability but when crumpled in hand, the films separated from the mesh.
Devices were easy to suture through as the films are transparent and mesh pores are
clearly visible.
Device 7
Description: SERI@ Surgical Scaffold fused with SF/F127 film (6x6 cm)
Execution: Non-sterile SERI@ Surgical Scaffolds were cut with stainless steel scissors
into 6 x 6 cm squares. Separately, silk fibroin solution (c = 8.1 % w/v) was mixed with
F127 (c = 10% w/v) in a 8:1 volume ratio then the mix was homogenized by pipetting
up and down. The solution (8 ml) was then cast in 10 cm square Petri dish bottoms
and dried on the bench top for 26 h.
Silk fibroin solution (c = 8.1% w/v) was used to mount the mesh onto the films.
Specifically, 2 ml of silk solution were added to the lid of a sterile 100 cm Petri dish
and were evenly spread with a sterile pipette tip. The mesh was placed in the dish until

its surface was uniformly wet. The mesh was then added onto the dried film and
smoothed down with gloved fingers to ensure uniform surface attachment. The
construct was dried flat on bench top for 45 minutes, then placed in 90% ethanol for 45
minutes. Subsequently, the prototype was placed in 1 L deionized water for 1h then
dried on bench top. The drying process caused films to shrink, curl and detach from the
mesh. Out of seven constructs prepared, two appeared well fused and smooth and
were sent for sterilization.
Sterilization: devices were placed in self-sealing pouches and ethylene oxide (EO)
sterilized.
Packaging/Storage: Sterile devices were kept in pouches for             under environmental
conditions
Testing:     Pouches were opened in the laminar flow hood and prototypes were
assessed for integrity and biological properties in vitro.
Observations: Devices remained intact during and after sterilization and when tested
for cell adherence, the results were comparable to the pre-sterilization data indicating
that EO sterilization did not alter the device's biological properties.

F127 (c = 10% w/v) in a 8:1 volume ratio then the mix was homogenized by pipetting
up and down. The solution (6 ml) was then cast in 10 cm square Petri dish bottoms and
dried in the vacuum oven for 18 h. Dried films in dishes were then treated with 6 ml of

samples were lyophilized for 24 hours to dry, then treated with 15 ml of ethanol (100%
v/v) for 45 min. Sponges were then removed from the tray, the edges were cut off ,
then were returned to the tray for an additional              30 minutes ethanol incubation.
Subsequently, sponges were dried flat covered with OmniTray lids and lead rings.
Silk fibroin solution (c = 8.1% w/v) was used to mount the mesh onto the films.
Specifically, 2 ml of silk solution were added to the lid of a sterile 100 cm Petri dish
and were evenly spread with a sterile pipette tip. The mesh was placed in the dish until
its surface was uniformly wet. The mesh was added onto the dried sponge (to the side
that contacted the tray while freezing) then         smoothed down with gloved fingers to
ensure uniform surface attachment. Prototypes were dried for 1 hour, then placed in
90% ethanol for 30 minutes and blotted. Subsequently, constructs were placed in
deionized water for 5 minutes for first wash. After the first wash, sponges were trimmed
down to the size of the 6x6cm mesh and then placed into second wash for 5 minutes.
Prototypes were washed one more time then pouched.
Sterilization: Devices were placed in MMPE and PPFP pouches, sealed and e-beam
sterilized.
Testing: Devices in both MMPE and PPFP pouches were examined two weeks after
sterilization for overall integrity, delamination, pliability and suturability.
Observations: Devices remained moist during and after sterilization. The devices had
good pliability and did not delaminate when crumpled in hand. However, the sponge
side appeared to shed when rubbed with gloved hands. The devices were easy to
suture through.

then cast in OmniTray lids and put into the -80'C freezer for two hours. Frozen
samples were lyophilized for 24 hours to dry, then treated with 15 ml of ethanol (100%
v/v) for 45 min. Sponges were then removed from the tray, the edges were cut off ,
then were returned to the tray for an additional              30 minutes ethanol incubation.
Subsequently, sponges were dried flat covered with OmniTray lids and lead rings. The
sponge can be viewed as a particular type of film (a sponge like film).
Silk fibroin solution (c = 8.1% w/v) was used to mount the mesh onto the films.
Specifically, 2 ml of silk solution were added to the lid of a sterile 100 cm Petri dish
and were evenly spread with a sterile pipette tip. The mesh was placed in the dish until
its surface was uniformly wet. The mesh was added onto the dried sponge (to the side
that contacted the tray while freezing) then         smoothed down with gloved fingers to
ensure uniform surface attachment. Prototypes were dried for 1 hour, then placed in
90% ethanol for 30 minutes and blotted. Subsequently, constructs were placed in
deionized water for 5 minutes for first wash. After the first wash, sponges were trimmed
down to the size of the 6x6cm mesh and then placed into second wash for 5 minutes.
The devices were washed one more time then pouched.
Sterilization: Devices were placed in MMPE and PPFP pouches, sealed and e-beam
sterilized.
Packaging/Storage: Devices were then kept in pouches and stored in a plastic bin
under environmental conditions.
Testing: Devices in both MMPE and PPFP pouches were examined two weeks after
sterilization for overall integrity, delamination, pliability and suturability.
Observations:      The devices remained moist during and after sterilization, had good
pliability and did not delaminate when crumpled in hand. This specific SF/HA
formulation yielded sponges that did not shed when rubbed with gloved hands and the
devices were easy to suture through.

Device swelling
Swelling characterization is crucial for implantable devices since after surgical
implantation of the device it is important that the device not cause tissue or nerve
compression due to device volume increases. To determine the extent of any swelling
of the anti-adhesive devices made, we compared dry device sample thicknesses to that
of device samples incubated under physiological conditions. Thickness measurements
were performed with a thickness dial gauge and 15 measurements were taken per 6x6
cm device. To mimic physiological environments, the devices were incubated in DPBS
at 370C, 50 rpm for 24 h. The results showed that devices 6, 7A, 8A, 9, 10 has no or
an insignificant or a clearly unsubstantial amount of swelling ( none or essentially no
swelling at all, that is + or - 5% of the reference value) (T TEST, p > 0.05) when
incubated under physiological conditions. The ORC prototypes (P1A, P2A and P3)
were not included in this evaluation since ORC gels in the presence of water and would
yield erroneous measurements.
Mechanical Testing
The mechanical properties of the devices (devices 1A, 2A, 3, 6, 7A, 8A, 9, 10 and 11A)
assessed their suitability for use in surgical soft tissue repair procedures.   SERI@
Surgical Scaffold (SERI mesh) was used as the reference material. Both tear testing
and burst testing was carried out. Briefly, samples were cut into 40x40 mm for burst
testing and 10x60 mm for tear testing and were immersed in PBS for 2 h at room
temperature. For burst testing, samples were mounted on the specimen clamp and the
ball burst fixture was pushed against the sample at a constant rate of 60mm/in until
sample failure. For tear testing, samples were affixed with clamps and pulled at a
constant rate of 2400 mm/min until sample failure.

The burst strength results showed that the fusion of films or sponges to SERI@ Surgical
Scaffold did not improve and did or deteriorate the reference's intrinsic mechanical
properties. All devices showed comparable to or very similar (that is + or - 10% of the
reference value) of to the burst strength values of the SERI@ Surgical Scaffold control
(t-test, p > 0.05).
The tensile testing of devices 1A, 2A, 3, 6, 7A, 8A, 9, 10 and 11A) also showed close
similarity to the control with comparable (i.e. + or - about 10% of the reference value)
"Elongation at break: values obtained for all devices (t-test, p > 0.05). However, device
10 was able to withstand about a 10% higher tensile loads at break as compared to the
SERI reference control (t-test p = 0.02).
Overall, this Example 4 showed that the swelling of the tested devices was negligible
and they would not pose any risk of compression to the surrounding tissue post
implantation. The ORC materials could not be tested because the sacrificial layer
gelled and disintegrated when hydrated, making sample manipulation impossible.
Additionally, the mechanical properties of the devices tested were very similar to SERI*
Surgical Scaffold showing that the devices can provide sufficient mechanical support
when implanted to assist soft tissue repair.
                                         Example 5
        Single Layer and Two Layered Anti-Adhesive Surface Silk Medical Devices
This Example 5 discloses two types of silk medical devices we made and
characterized.      Both types of devices we made included a particular new, knitted silk
mesh (or scaffold). The first type of device we made was a particular knitted silk mesh
(or scaffold) prepared with at least one surface or side of the device having an anti
adhesive (i.e. having a smooth or low profile with full coverage of open space or pores)
surface. This silk mesh of this first type of device bioresorbs after implantation over
about 1-3 years. The second type of device we made also comprised a first layer of
knitted silk mesh (scaffold), as with the first device, and with the anti-adhesive property
provided by a sacrificial (second) layer attached to or fused to one side of the first
knitted mesh layer of the second device. The sacrificial layer is comprised entirely or
mainly of a faster (preferably over at least about 10 days and no more than about 30
days) bioresorbable yarn. Thus this two layer, second type of device has a front or top
                                              57

 WO 2015/027144                                                        PCT/US2014/052264
side made of the knitted silk mesh (which does not have an anti-adhesive property) and
a back or bottom side formed by an anti-adhesive, sacrificial layer, which sacrificial
layer can be made of quickly bioresorbing fibers, such as PGA, PLGA and/or ORC
fibers.   The anti-adhesive property of either the first type or device or of the second
type of device prevents or reduces tissue (for example bowel tissue and/or abdominal
viscera) adhesion to the (bottom or back) side of the device placed in contact with the
bowel tissue or the abdominal viscera. It is important to note that the (top or front) side
of the device is the knitted silk mesh layer of the device which top or front side of the
device does not have an anti-adhesive property, and in fact the pores on the top or
front side of the device (for both the first and the     second type of device) facilitates
tissue ingrowth onto and into the front or top side of the device.      In this manner the
device, as with the SERI* Surgical Scaffold, provides soft tissue mechanical support
and a soft tissue load bearing function as new connective tissue forms onto and into
the slowly biodegrading top or font side of the implanted device.
Thus both types of devices made in this Example 5 had an anti-adhesive property and
additionally were made using a single step fabrication (textile knitting) process.
Thus we developed new silk based medical devices (with a knitted silk mesh layer) for
use in various medical and surgical procedures, including in hernia repair procedures
which silk based devices due to their anti-adhesive property can resist or prevent post
operative adhesion formations on the anti-adhesive side of the device.
Materials
The four types of yarns we used for the embodiments of our invention made were:
.   6 filament, low twist, sericin extracted silk yarn.
.   9 filament, high twist, sericin extracted silk yarn.
.   45D PGA yarn (for example made by Teleflex Medical as Deknatel*). This is anl8
filament, 45 denier, violet,       polyglycolic acid (PGA) fiber processed with water
washable spin finish (up to 4% w/w).

WO 2015/027144                                                        PCT/US2014/052264
.   128D PGA yarn (for example also made Teleflex Medical under the Deknatel*
brand name). This is a 48 filament, 128 denier, undyed, polyglycolic acid (PGA) fiber
processed with water-washable spin finish (up to 4% w/w).
The silk yarn was used to make the first type of device or to make the top of front side
layer of the second type of device. The PGA (non-silk) yarns were used to make the
sacrificial layer of the second type of device.    A mineral oil (such as a heavy, white,
mineral oil available from Avantor) was used to coat the yarns to facilitate their knitting.
Oil residue can be later removed from the yarns and/or from the knitted device by a
variety of methods including soaking (washing) and/or carbon dioxide treatment.
Equipment
The backwinder (single head) used was made by SIMET as model number SE-01.
The knitting machine used was made by COMEZ as model number EL-800-8B. This is
a double needle bed warp knitter with 8 bar capability including two long throw bars.
The thickness gauge made by Kafer as model number J-1 00 C
The testing equipment we used was made by Instron as model number E3000 (tensile
tester).
As set forth above we made two types of silk based medical devices in this Example 5.
All the devices made included at least a knitted silk mesh (scaffold), for example as the
base layer. The first type of device made comprised only the knitted silk mesh with one
side having a low profile, low sheer, full coverage, anti-adhesive property (i.e. satin
knit). This first type of silk device was made to bioresorb over about 1-3 years after
implantation. The second type of silk device we made comprised the knitted silk mesh
layer of the first device attached or fused to a second, anti-adhesive, sacrificial knitted
non-silk fiber layer . The sacrificial layer comprised entirely or mainly a faster (over at
least about 10 days but over less than about 30 days) bioresorbable non-silk fibers.

Devices without a Sacrificial Layer (Base Layer Meshes)
For the base layer mesh of the devices we made with a sacrificial layer or with an anti
adhesive we developed a single layer using low denier, low twist yarn using a knit
pattern that provides a low profile (smooth) surface to the material to thereby eliminate
or minimize irritation to the bowel and hence remove or substantially reduce adhesion
formation onto the side of the device (i.e. the smooth side facing the bowel tissue.
Embodiment we made of such a suitable device we refer to as "the Single Bed 102" or
as the "SBR 202". The SBR 202 devices are six filament mesh devices.
Specifically, the    Single Bed 102 devices were made as a series of "SS-PO1-OX"
devices, where X is an integer 1 and higher (i.e. the devices referenced as the series
of devices P01-01-OX). Thus several versions of this device were made (i.e. the SS
P01-01-OX device versions).      This device has a low profile (smooth) surface on the
bowel facing side made on a single bed (front bed) knitting machine with about half the
stitch density used for SERI Surgical Scaffold, resulting in a thinner, low sheer, full
coverage knitted silk fabric and a low (smooth) loop profile.

Anti-adhesive knitted (satin) devices
With this device, the anti-adhesive layer (side facing bowel) was made using silk yarn
and a satin knit pattern combined to the SS-PO1-01 (single bed 102 design). The satin
knitting consists of long strides of yarn crossing back and forth along more than one
needle. This back and forth motion of the yarn creates a "wood stack" type of design
that runs along the fabric course direction leading to a lustrous appearance and the
"smooth" hand characteristic of satin fabrics. The percent coverage of the surface can
be controlled by the crossing angle and the amount of yarn crossing at a given time.
The crossing angle is controlled by the number of needles across which the yarn

Devices with a Sacrificial Layer
The second type of devices we made in this Example 5 had a sacrificial layer. The (top
or front) side facing the abdominal wall or muscle area was made primarily or entirely
of knitted silk (that is porous and mechanically strong) and promotes tissue integration.
The (bottom or back) side facing the bowel comprises the sacrificial layer. This bottom
or back side layer is made of a material or a composite that allows temporary tissue
adhesion to the sacrificial layer to occur.       Shortly after implantation (within about 10
days to about 30 days after implantation), the sacrificial layer is mechanically
compromised by being biodegraded and bioresorbed leading to the separation of the
adhering tissue (i.e. bowel tissue) from the device. The sacrificial layer comprising
devices are biocompatible, made by knitting (textile machinery) of yarns by a twisting,
backwinding, and warp knitting process, and as noted can for example lose at least
50% of their mechanical integrity or strength within 10-30 days after implantation of the
                                                63

 WO 2015/027144                                                        PCT/US2014/052264
device with such a sacrificial layer. We determined that suitable materials to comprise
the sacrificial layer can be knittable non-silk fibers of polyglycolic acid (PGA), poly
lactic-co-glycolic    acid    (PLGA),     oxidized    regenerated      cellulose     (ORC),
carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and combinations thereof.           The sacrificial layers of
embodiment made were made using the 45D PGA yarn but can also be made using
various deniers of PGA, PLGA, ORC, CMC or a combination thereof.
Embodiments of Sacrificial Layer comprising devices made :
 1. Shag carpet device (several versions of this shag carpet device were made, as the
S-P02-02-OX and SS-P02-03-OX device versions). These devices had a shag carpet
like structure with the protruding loops act as the sacrificial layer (side facing bowel).
The shag carpet devices consisted of two components or layers. The first was the
base layer of (knitted silk) fabric that provided the overall fabric integrity and the load
distribution when subjected to external mechanical forces. The second layer was a
loose (non-silk) knitted yarn that forms extended loops protruding vertically away from
the base fabric plane, hence giving the fabric its characteristic loopy or shag like
texture. The percent loop coverage of the surface can be controlled by the loop length
(controlled by feed rate), the amount of loose yarn per loop (controlled both by feed
rate, yarn count, and number of threads per count), and the number of loops per
surface area (controlled by machine gauge used and pattern).
 In the case of the devices described, loops can be formed on the base silk fabric
(device SS-P01-01) by using a simple closed (or open) tricot stitch swinging back and
forth between adjacent needles with high feed rate.

2. Another embodiment of a sacrificial layer comprising device made was the satin

layer (the side facing the bowel, and made of PGA, PLGA, ORC, CMC or combinations
thereof) was made using a 'satin' knit pattern combined to the SS-PO1-01 (single bed
 102 design). 'Satin' consists of long strides of non-silk yarn crossing back and forth
along more than one needle. This back and forth motion of the yarn creates 'wood
stack' type of design that run along the fabric course direction leading to a lustrous

Devices with Detachable Layers (several versions of this device were made, as the SS
P04-OX detachable layer version series)
Unlike the satin and the shag carpet devices, the non-silk sacrificial layer in this device
was not integrated with the base knitted silk fabric.               It instead constituted an
independent layer that peeled away from the base fabric within 30 days of implantation.
It was typically a tightly knit non-silk fabric with small pore size (70 - 200 micron
diameter). As depicted in Figure 22. The non-silk sacrificial layer and the knitted silk
base fabric were linked together using a fast resorbing/degrading yarn that was
                                                68

 WO 2015/027144                                                        PCT/US2014/052264
designed to be the first component of the assemble to fail mechanically leading
therefore to the separation of the two layers.
To do so, a double needle bed was needed. The front bed was used to knit the base
fabric as in SS-PO1-01 (bars # 4, 5, and 7) made out of silk and integrates with the
abdominal wall tissue and act as the main load carrier. Meanwhile, the back bed was
used to knit the sacrificial layer (bar # 1). This layer can be made using either slow
bioresorbing material like silk or fast resorbing material like PGA or ORC. Finally, the
yarn used to link both fabrics (layers) was threaded through a dedicated bar (bar # 2)
and knits on both beds. This yarn consisted of low denier PGA or any other fast
resorbing/degrading yarn, e.g. PLGA (90-10) and ORC yarns.
The detachable (triple) layered devices (reference number of detachable layered
devices: SS-P04-OX), unlike for satin and "shag carpet" devices, these embodiments
knit independently two textile layers (the base layer and the detaching layer) and then
knit them together with a fast resorbing/degrading yarn (resulting in a three layered
device). The middle layer disintegrated and so separated of the two outer layers within
 10-30 days of implantation (see Figure 21), thus preventing the adhesion of tissue to
the base layer while keeping the tissue covered with the detaching layer. The
detaching layer consisted of a tightly knit non-silk fabric with small pore size (70 - 200
micron diameter). A double needle bed knitter was used. The front bed was used to
knit the base fabric as in SS-PO1-01 (bars # 4, 5, and 7). Meanwhile, the back bed was
used to knit the detaching layer (bar # 1). This layer can be made using either slow
bioresorbing material like silk or fast resorbing material like PGA, PLGA or ORC.
Finally, the yarn used to link both fabrics (layers) was threaded through a dedicated bar
(bar # 2) and knits on both beds (constituting the middle layer). This yarn consisted of
low denier PGA or any other fast resorbing/degrading yarn, e.g. PLGA (90-10) and
ORC yarns.
The percent coverage of the surface was controlled by the gauge used on the back
bed, crossing angle, and the amount of yarn crossing at a given time. The crossing
angle was controlled by the number of needles across which the yarn crosses and the
amount of yarn is controlled by the number of threads per guide and the yarn denier.
Weft insertion between both fabric layers was an additional option to increase surface
coverage and shield direct exposure between silk (in the base fabric) and bowel

Device Testing and Characterization
All device testing was performed with a sample size of n = 15.
Thickness
Device (n =15) thickness was measured using the J-100 Kafer thickness gauge. The
average thickness values ± one standard deviation are shown in the Figure 25 graph
below. All SS-POX devices were 22 to 37% percent thinner than SERI Surgical Scaffold
(also known as Standard 102 or as SERI@ Standard). This confirms the thinner profile
produced from knitting on a single bed with low pick density. The thinner profile along
with the non-looping course design resulted in a smoother fabric (hand feel). SS-P01
01-01 had the lowest thickness value that correlates with the absence of any added
material (e.g. PGA, ORC, etc. to the back of the fabric.
Burst Strength
Device burst testing was carried out. Average burst strength and stiffness values ± one
standard deviation are shown in Figure 26 and 27.
Except for SS-PO1-01-01, all other tested SS-POX series had 10% to 150% increase in
the burst strength and stiffness at time 0 when compared to the SERI@ Standard. The
lower values recorded for SS-PO1-01-01 can be explained by the lower densities of silk
used to make the prototype and lack of any other yarns attached to the back, i.e. PGA.
                                            72

 WO 2015/027144                                                        PCT/US2014/052264
For abdominal wall reconstruction, the maximal anatomical (intra-abdominal) pressure
is about 20 kPa. To withstand this, the device has a minimal burst strength of about
0.11 MPa Based on these considerations, the burst strength values determined for the
silk/PGA prototypes indicated that they were suitable for abdominal reconstruction
procedures. In terms burst stiffness, any device with a stiffness value equal or higher
than the SERI@ Standard can be suitable for abdominal wall reconstruction.
Suture pull out
Device suture pull out testing was carried out. Average suture pull-out strength values
± one standard deviation are reported in Figure 28.
The suture pull-out strength for all SS-POX prototypes was equal or higher (up to 70 %
higher in the case of SS-P02-02-1 0) to that of the SERI@ Standard at time zero. Given
that the SERI@ Standard suture pull-out strength        is compatible with abdominal wall
repair procedures, all SS-POX prototypes can perform adequately in the abdominal
setting.
Tensile testing
Device tensile testing was performed both in the wale and course directions. Tensile
testing (single pull to failure) was performed in the direction of fabric formation and in
the fabric width (course) direction. Average tensile strength, % elongation at break, and
values ± one standard deviation are reported in Figures 29 to 32. Figure 29 shows the
maximum load in the machine (fabric length) direction. Figure 30 shows the percent
elongation at break in the machine (fabric length) direction.        Figure 31 shows the

elongation at break in the course (fabric width) direction.
Based on these results, all SS-POX were 77 -150% stronger in the machine direction
then the SERI@ Standard. Along the fabric width however, the strength was ranging
from half as strong (SS-PO1-01-01) to two and half times stronger (SS-P02-02-08) than
SERI® Standard. Additionally, the pattern change described for the satin devices, that

decrease the device pore size 3x, lead to a threefold increase in the strength along the
fabric width. This is a result of a threefold increase of courses per unit length (SS-P02
02-02 and SS-P02-02-08). These results illustrate how the mechanical properties of the
knitted devices can be modulated by controlling the knit design.

specification have been described with reference to the various embodiments, one
skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the specific examples disclosed are only
illustrative of the principles of the subject matter disclosed herein. Therefore, it should
be understood that the disclosed subject matter is in no way limited to a particular
methodology, protocol, and/or reagent, etc., described herein. As such, various
modifications or changes to or alternative configurations of the disclosed subject matter
can be made in accordance with the teachings herein without departing from the spirit
of the present specification. Lastly, the terminology used herein is for the purpose of
describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the
present invention, which is defined solely by the claims. Accordingly, the present
invention is not limited to that precisely as shown and described.
[000108] Certain embodiments of this invention are described herein, including the
best mode known to the inventors for carrying out the invention. Of course, variations
on these described embodiments will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the
art upon reading the foregoing description. The inventor expects skilled artisans to
employ such variations as appropriate, and the inventors intend for the invention to be
practiced otherwise than specifically described herein. Accordingly, this invention
includes all modifications and equivalents of the subject matter recited in the claims
appended hereto as permitted by applicable law. Moreover, any combination of the
above-described elements in all possible variations thereof is encompassed by the

and claimed individually or in any combination with other members of the group or
other elements found herein. It is anticipated that one or more members of a group
may be included in, or deleted from, a group for reasons of convenience and/or
patentability. When any such inclusion or deletion occurs, the specification is deemed
to contain the group as modified thus fulfilling the written description of all Markush
groups used in the appended claims.
[000110] Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients,
properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the
specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the
term "about." As used herein, the term "about" means that the item, parameter or term
so qualified encompasses a range of plus or minus ten percent above and below the
value of the stated item, parameter or term. Accordingly, unless indicated to the
contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims
are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be
obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the
application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical
parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant
digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.               Notwithstanding that the
numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are
approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as
precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors
necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing
measurements
[000111] The terms "a," "an," "the" and similar referents used in the context of
describing the invention (especially in the context of the following claims) are to be
construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein
or clearly contradicted by context. Recitation of ranges of values herein is merely
intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate
value falling within the range. Unless otherwise indicated herein, each individual value
is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein. All methods
described herein can be performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated
herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of any and all examples, or
exemplary language (e.g., "such as") provided herein is intended merely to better

illuminate the invention and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the invention
otherwise claimed. No language in the specification should be construed as indicating
any non-claimed element essential to the practice of the invention.
[000112] Specific embodiments disclosed herein may be further limited in the claims
using consisting of or consisting essentially of language. When used in the claims,
whether as filed or added per amendment, the transition term "consisting of' excludes
any element, step, or ingredient not specified in the claims. The transition term
"consisting essentially of' limits the scope of a claim to the specified materials or steps
and those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s).
Embodiments of the invention so claimed are inherently or expressly described and
enabled herein.
