Abstract
EXCAVATION UTILIZING DUAL HOPPER SYSTEM
A guidance system (200) and method for guiding excavation at an excavation site (104) utilizes
an excavating machine (100) and an in-pit crusher and conveyer (IPCC) (102) having a first
hopper (170) and a second hopper (172) for receiving material. The guidance system (200) can
receive first hopper data (248) associated with the first hopper (170) and second hopper data
(268) associated with the second hopper (172) and can process the first hopper data (248) and
second hopper data (268) to determine a selected hopper (314) for dispensing material. In an
aspect, the guidance system (200) can generate a guidance indication to display to the operator of
the excavating machine (100) that indicates the selected hopper (314).

Description
EXCAVATION UTILIZING DUAL HOPPER SYSTEM
Technical Field
[0001]     The present disclosure relates generally to excavation of material from an excavation
site by the cooperative interaction between an excavating machine and an in-pit crusher and
conveyer system and, more particularly, to excavation with a dual hopper in-pit crusher and
conveyer system.
Background
[0002]     Excavating material such as coal, ore, or other minerals from an excavation site, such
as an open pit mine, may be accomplished using an excavating machine such as a rope shovel
equipped with a digging tool to physically remove material from the ground and to dispense the
material to a hauling machine such as a dump truck. The hauling machine transports the material
from the excavation site while the excavating machine remains in place to continue excavating
material. Therefore, several hauling machines may be required to keep pace with single
excavating machine and maintain efficiency of the operation. More recently, in-pit crushing and
conveying ("IPCC") systems have been proposed in which the excavating machine dispenses
material into a processing unit referred to as an in-pit crusher that has a funnel-like hopper to
receive the dispensed material and a local crushing or grinding unit to pulverize or breakup the
material for easier handling. The IPCC is operatively associated with a conveyer that transports
the processed material away from the excavation site to a common hauling point. Benefits of the
IPCC process include a reduction in the required number of hauling machines and/or the travel
distance that the hauling machines must cover, which may be especially advantageous if the
hauling machines are otherwise required to travel long, uphill distances to exit the excavation
site.
[0003]     One example of excavating with an IPCC is disclosed in U.S. Patent 8,768,579 ("the
'579 patent"), which describes an arrangement of a rope shovel operating to dig and dispense
material to a nearby IPCC unit which processes the material for transportation on a conveyer
away from the excavation site. To facilitate swinging the digging tool of the rope shovel over the

                                                  -2
hopper on the IPCC, the '579 patent in particular describes a system of position sensors and
electronic controllers configured to calculate the ideal path between the rope shovel and the
hopper. The system outputs the results as feedback to assist the operator of the rope shovel. The
present disclosure is similarly directed to improving an excavation operation utilizing an
excavating machine in cooperation with an IPCC configured with at least a first hopper and a
second hopper.
Summary
[0004]     The disclosure describes, in one aspect, an excavating machine for excavation at an
excavation site that is configured to operate in conjunction with a first hopper and a second
hopper. The excavating machine includes a digging tool for excavating and dispensing material
into the first or second hoppers. The excavating machine also includes a machine receiver for
receiving first hopper data associated with the first hopper and second hopper data associated
with the second hopper. To determine a selected hopper from between the first hopper and the
second hopper, the excavating machine includes a guidance system that is in communication
with the machine receiver and that is configured to process the first hopper data and the second
hopper data for making the selection.
[0005]     In another aspect, the disclosure describes a method of assisting excavation at an
excavation site utilizing a first hopper and a second hopper at an excavation site. According to
the method, first hopper data associated with the first hopper and second hopper data associated
with the second hopper are received and compared to determine a selected hopper from the first
hopper and the second hopper for depositing excavated material. The method generates a
guidance indication reflecting the selected hopper and can display the guidance indication to an
operator of an excavating machine operating in cooperation with the first hopper and the second
hopper to assist in excavation.
[0006]     In yet another aspect, the disclosure describes a guidance system for assisting
excavation at an excavation site utilizing a first hopper and a second hopper. The guidance
system works in cooperation with a machine controller operatively associated with an excavating
machine and communicating with a machine receiver disposed on the excavating machine. The
first hopper and the second hopper can include a first hopper transmitter operatively associated

                                                   -3
with a first hopper that transmits first hopper data associated with the first hopper and a second
hopper transmitter operatively associated with the second hopper that communicates second
hopper data associated with the second hopper. The guidance system is configured to determine
a selected hopper for dispensing material into based on comparison of the first hopper data and
the second hopper data.

Detailed Description
[0007]      Now referring to the figures, wherein like reference numbers refer to like elements,
there is illustrated in FIG. 1 a excavating machine 100 operating in cooperation with a in-pit
crusher and conveyer ("IPCC") system 102 to excavate material from an excavation site 104. An
excavation site 104 in accordance with the present disclosure may be a large scale, open cast or
open-pit mine in which overburden is removed or stripped from the surface of the ground by the
excavating machine 100 to access the material of interest, which may be coal, ore, or minerals.
Excavation results in the planar or horizontal pit floor 106 being continuously lowered while the
excavation site 104 is expanded by operation of the excavating machine 100 to remove material
from a vertical bank or pit wall 108 that rises from the pit floor 106. In addition to mining, the

                                                 -4
excavation site 104 may be intended to create cannels, reservoirs, or other large scale civil
engineering projects.
[0008]     For excavation on the scale of the present disclosure, the excavating machine 100 may
be a mining shovel such as a rope shovel or power shovel that removes material from the
excavation site 104 by digging into the pit wall 108 to loosen and remove material from the
vertical bank. To dig or crowd into the pit wall 108, the excavating machine 100 can include a
digging tool 110 that is pivotally and slidably supported on an upper structure 112 that in turn is
supported on and carried by an undercarriage 114. To mobilize the excavating machine 100 and
propel it about the excavation site 104, the undercarriage 114 can include traction devices such
as continuous tracks 116 that are disposed on each side of the excavating machine 100. The
continuous tracks 116 form a closed loop or belt disposed around one or more drive wheels or
drive sprockets 118 that are rotatably attached to the undercarriage 114 at fixed locations.
Rotation of the drive sprockets 118 cause the continuous tracks 116 to translate with respect to
the undercarriage 114 thereby propelling the excavating machine 100 over the pit floor 106 in
the forward or reverse directions, or they can turn the excavating machine 100 toward the sides.
In other embodiments, however, other traction devices can be utilized to propel the excavating
machine 100 about the excavation site 104 such as rotating wheels. Furthermore, in addition to
the illustrated rope shovel, other examples of mobile excavating machines 100 include draglines,
excavators, wheel or track loaders, hoes and the like. In addition, the excavating machine 100
can be stationary in configuration by omission of the continuous tracks 116.
[0009]     The digging tool 110 can include a boom 120, which may be an elongated, beam-like
structure pivotally connected at its proximate lower end 122 to the upper structure 112 and that
extends upwardly to a distal upper end 124. The boom 120 may project forward of the
excavating machine 100 by extending at an angle of, for example, 600 with respect to the upper
structure 112. To support the boom 120 at its upright, angled orientation, one or more suspension
ropes 126 can be attached proximate the distal upper end 124 and extend down to an A-frame
shaped backstay 128 disposed on the upper structure 112. To penetrate into and remove material
from the vertical pit wall 108, the boom 120 can support a dipper assembly 130 that includes a
bucket-like dipper 132 disposed at the distal end of an elongated dipper arm 134. The dipper arm
134 is pivotally supported and can slide with respect to the upright boom 120 by operation of a
saddle block 136 that is disposed approximately midway between the proximate lower end 122

                                                  -5
and the distal upper end 124. During a digging operation, the dipper assembly 130 is swung
upwardly with respect to the pit wall 108 while being projected or forced forwardly into the pit
wall 108 so that material is dislodged and collected into the dipper 132. To enable the dipper
assembly 130 to translate with respect to the boom 120, the saddle block 136 can be configured
as a sleeve or cradle that supports and interacts with the dipper arm 134 via bearings, rollers, or
the like. The process of extending and penetrating the dipper assembly 130 into the pit wall 108
to remove material may be referred to as crowding. To dispense material from the dipper
assembly 130, the bottom or floor of the bucket-like dipper 130 can be released allowing the
material to fall out of the dipper 130.
[0010]     To cause the relative motion between the dipper assembly 130 and the boom 120, the
excavating machine 100 can include a hoist system 140 disposed on the upper structure 112 that
includes various motors, actuators, and rigging for operation. For example, to hoist or lower the
dipper 132 in the vertical direction, the hoist system 140 can include hoist cables or hoist ropes
142 that are attached to the rear of the dipper 132 and that extend upwardly around a sheave 144
or pulley disposed at the distal upper end 124 of the boom 120. The hoist ropes 142 partially
wrap around the sheave 144 to reverse direction and extend back downwards generally parallel
to the boom 120 to wrap around a hoist wench 146 disposed in the upper structure 112. The hoist
wench 146 may be operatively coupled to a motor to selectively rotate to wind in or pay out the
hoist ropes 142. Winding in the hoist ropes 142 can pivot the dipper assembly 130 upwardly with
respect to the boom 120 while paying out the hoist ropes 142 can lower the dipper assembly 130
with respect to the boom 120. In addition, the dipper assembly 130 can be operatively associated
with one or more crowd ropes 150 that are attached proximate to the respective ends of the
dipper arm 134 and that wrap around the saddle block 136 to extend down to a crowd wench 152
rotatably disposed on the boom 120. The crowd wench 152 can rotate to pay out or take in the
crowd ropes 150 in a manner that causes the dipper arm 134 to slidably translate with respect to
the boom 120 by operation of the saddle block 136. Sequential action of the hoisting and
crowding motions with respect to the pit wall 108 crowds the dipper assembly 130 into the pit
wall 108 dislodging material and filling the dipper 132. While the foregoing description of the
digging tool 110 relates to a rope-operated configuration, it will be appreciated that in other
embodiments, the digging tool 110 may be operated by other methods or processes.

                                                 -6
[0011]     To move the dislodged material away from the pit wall 108, the upper structure 112
can swing or rotate with respect to the undercarriage 114. For example, the upper structure 112
and the undercarriage 114 may be operatively connected through a rotatable turn table or swing
platform 160 that can swing the upper structure 112 about a swing axis 162 that extends
vertically through the excavating machine 100. To provide power for the hoist system 140, hoist
and crowd wenches 146, 152, and the continuous tracks 116, the excavating machine 100
includes an electrical system 164 that receives three-phase electrical power through a trail cable
166 from an off-board electrical source and that distributes power to the various components. In
alternative embodiments, however, the excavating machine may include an on-board prime
mover such as an internal combustion engine that combusts hydrocarbon-based fuel to generate
mechanical power. To accommodate an operator and the various controls, gauges, and interfaces
for operating the excavating machine 100, an operator's station 168 can be disposed on the upper
structure 112 in a location that provides a view towards the digging tool 110.
[0012]     The in-pit crusher and conveyer ("IPCC") system 102 operates in cooperation with the
excavating machine 100 to transfer the material removed from the pit wall 108. In the illustrated
embodiment, the IPCC 102 can be a dual hopper configuration including a first hopper 170 and a
second hopper 172 that are supported on an IPCC frame 174. The first and second hoppers 170,
172 can be configured as funnel-like structures that receive material through their opened top
ends and tapper inwardly towards their bottom ends to direct the material to first conveyer 176
disposed under the first hopper 170 and a second conveyer 178 disposed under the second
hopper 172 respectively. The first and second conveyers 176, 178 can be configured as flexible,
closed belts made of rubber or the like that extend around and are supported by conveyer pulleys.
One or more of the conveyer pulleys can be made to rotate causing the belt of the conveyers 176,
178 to translate with respect to the bottom of the first and second hoppers 170, 172.
[0013]      To pulverize the deposited material, the first and second conveyers 176, 178 can
extend upwardly to and terminate at the opening of a first material processing device 180 and a
second material processing device 182 respectively. The conveyers 176, 178 thereby drop the
material into respective material processing devices 180, 182. The first and second material
processing devices 180, 182 can be configured as grinders that breakup the material into finer
grades of particulate matter or aggregate for easier handling and transfer. In particular, the first
and second material processing devices 180, 182 can be upright structures that include internal

                                                   -7
gears, teeth or blades that interact to shred or masticate the deposited material that is then
dispensed from the lower end. The first and second material processing devices 180, 182 can
further include vibrators and the like to assist in processing the material. The IPCC 102 can be
operatively associated with a secondary conveyer system, or in other embodiments with hauling
machines, that transport process material away from the open pit of the excavation site 104 to
another location where the processed material can be further refined, separated, and/or hauled
away.
[0014]     To enable the IPCC 102 to independently move about the excavation site 104, in an
embodiment, the IPCC frame 174 can be supported on another plurality of continuous tracks 184
that contact and can be made to translate with respect to the pit floor 106. Hence, as the pit wall
108 shifts location, the excavating machine 100 and the mobile IPCC 102 can be moved to
continue the excavation. However, in other embodiments, the IPCC 102 may be stationary and
require another device to move it about the excavation site 104. To accommodate an operator
and controls for directing operation of the IPCC 102, an operator's station 188 can be disposed
on the side of the IPCC frame 174 above the continuous tracks 184. In the present embodiment,
assuming the scale of the excavating machine 100 and the excavation site 104, it can be
appreciated that the IPCC 102 can be several meters high.
[0015]     Referring to FIG. 2, the excavation process using the excavating machine 100 in
cooperation with the IPCC 102 can be understood. The excavating machine 100 is oriented
toward the pit wall 108 extending along the excavation site 104 and the IPCC 102 can be
positioned behind the excavating machine 100, preferably within a swing radius 163 defined by
the distance that the digging tool 110 extends outwardly with respect to the swing radius 163.
Accordingly, the first and second hoppers 170, 172 are within reach of the excavating machine
100 as it rotates with respect to the swing axis 162 so that the excavating machine 100 can
remain stationary during each digging cycle. In the illustrated embodiment, the dual-hopper
IPCC 102 can be configured with the first hopper 170 disposed in a side-by-side relation with the
second hopper 172. The first and second hoppers 170, 172 and their respectively associated first
and second material processing devices 180, 182 can discharge the processed material through a
common outlet. However, in other embodiments, other configurations for the dual-hopper IPCC
102 are possible such as a T-configuration with the first and second hopper 170, 172 spaced
apart and discharging to a common discharge outlet or a side-by-side configuration of the first

                                                   -8
and second hoppers 170, 172 each discharging to separate discharge outlets. Furthermore, the
disclosure contemplates distinct first and second IPCC units each having a single hopper
arranged together, for example, on either side of the excavating machine 100, and operating in
parallel with each other. Further embodiments of the disclosure can include three or more
hoppers arranged radially about the swing axis of the excavating machine 100 to receive
material.
[0016]    To excavate material, the digging tool 110 is crowded into the pit wall 108 in a manner
that removes material from the pit wall 108. The excavating machine 100 is swung around its
swing axis 162 away from the pit wall 108 toward the IPCC 102 located within the swing radius
163. The digging tool 110 can be positioned over or above either the first hopper 170 or the
second hopper 172 and the material dispensed or released from the excavating machine 100. The
IPCC 102 then processes the material as described above and can discharge the processed
material to a secondary conveyer system 190. In the illustrated embodiment, the secondary
conveyer system 190 can include an intermediate conveyer 192 and a main conveyer 194 that are
disposed in the excavation site 104. The main conveyer 194 can be generally fixed in location
while the intermediate conveyer 192 is relatively more mobile so that it can be extended and
adjusted to follow proximately with the excavating machine 100 and the IPCC 102. The
intermediate and main conveyers 192, 194 can be of a closed loop construction and include
closed belts, slide plates, or trays, and can be straight in alignment or can include various suitable
bends or turns. In addition, the secondary conveyer system 190 can be configured to elevate the
processed material from the pit floor 106 out of the excavation site 104 to a location where the
material may be more accessible. In another aspect of the disclosure, the IPCC may dispense
processed material dispensed into the first or second hoppers 170, 172 into hauling machines
such as dump trucks for transporting the processed material from the excavation site 104.
[0017]    While the IPCC 102 is processing the dispensed material and discharging it to the
secondary conveyer system 190 or to the hauling machines, the excavating machine 100 can
swing about the swing axis 162 back to engage the pit wall 108 with the digging tool 110 again.
Hence, the excavating machine 100, the IPCC 102, and the secondary conveyer system 190
operate concurrently to continuously remove and process material from the excavation site 104.

                                                   -9
[0018]     In the present embodiment where the dual-hopper IPCC 102 includes a first hopper
170 and a second hopper 172, operation of the excavating machine 100 and the IPCC 102 can be
synchronized for improving the excavation process. Referring to FIG. 3, to synchronize the
excavating machine 100 and IPCC 102, the excavating machine 100 and dual-hopper IPCC 102
can be operatively associated with a computerized or electronic guidance system 200 that is
configured to coordinate, control, and guide cooperative or simultaneous operation of the two
devices. In various embodiments, the guidance system 200 may be intended to provide
operational guidance to an operator of the excavating machine 100, or may be intended to
automatically guide and direct operation of the excavating machine 100 without operator
intervention. The guidance system 200 can be physically embodied as a communications
network or computerized excavation network 202 that interconnects and establishes
communication to exchange data and information between the excavating machine 100, the
IPCC 102, and other systems and devices about the excavation site 104; although in specific
embodiments, the guidance system 200 may reside with, or be more particularly associated with,
a specific component.
[0019]     For example, to establish interaction between the excavating machine 100 and the
excavation network 202 in a manner that maintains the guidance system 200 for execution, the
excavating machine 100 can include an electronically actuated machine controller 210 onboard
that is able to execute and process various software instructions, programs, functions, steps,
routines, tasks and processes. The machine controller 210 can be embodied as a microprocessor,
an application specific integrated circuit ("ASIC"), or other appropriate circuitry and may have
computer readable and writable memory or other data storage capabilities. The computer
readable and writable readable memory can include any suitable type of electronic memory
devices such as random access memory ("RAM"), read only memory ("ROM"), dynamic
random access memory ("DRAM"), flash memory and the like. The computer readable and
writable memory may store data and applications such as data tables, charts, maps, and the like
saved in and executable from the memory or another electronically accessible storage medium to
assist in operation of the excavating machine 100. The machine controller 210 may be
responsible for controlling operation of other components of the excavating machine or may be
integrated with other control devices through, for example, an CAN bus associated with the
excavating machine. Although in the schematic representation of FIG. 3, the machine controller
210 is represented as a single, discrete unit, in other embodiments, the machine controller 210

                                                  -10
and its functions may be distributed among a plurality of distinct and separate components
associated with the excavating machine 100.
[0020]     To enable the machine controller 210 to send, receive, and process data about the
excavation process via the excavation network 202, the machine controller 210 can be
operatively associated with any of various sensors, communication devices, and other logical or
electronic components. For example, to establish communication with the IPCC 102 and/or the
excavation network 202, a mobile machine communications device in the form of a machine
receiver/transmitter 212 can be disposed on the excavating machine 100 and is configured to
send and receive electronic signals that may be in digital or analog format. The machine
receiver/transmitter 212 can include an antenna to receive and emit signals such as radio
frequency waves. In other embodiments, the machine receiver/transmitter 212 can communicate
through other wireless technologies such as infrared, Bluetooth, optical recognition, and the like.
Furthermore, in other embodiments, the machine receiver/transmitter 212 can be configured for
wired communication by sending and receiving electrical, optical, or other forms of signals over
communications wires or busses. While the present embodiment of the machine
receiver/transmitter 212 can send and receive signals, in other embodiments the machine
receiver/transmitter 212 may be limited to either receiving or transmitting, and the term
"receiver/transmitter" should be interpreted in both the conjunction and disjunctive sense. The
machine receiver/transmitter 212 and the machine controller 210 can include or be associated
with circuitry or like to convert or interpret the sent or received signals into data and information
that can be electronically or digitally processed to facilitate operation of the excavating machine
100.
[0021]     To provide information about the location or position of the excavating machine 100
with respect to the excavation site 104, the machine controller 210 can also be operatively
associated with a positioning device or machine position sensor 214. The machine position
sensor 214 can recognize or determine the relative position of the excavating machine 100 with
respect to other units disposed about the excavation site and can relay the machine position data
to the guidance system 200 via the machine controller 210. For example, the machine position
sensor 214 can operate on a Global Navigation Satellite System ("GNSS") whereby the machine
position data associated with the excavating machine 100 is triangulated from received satellite
signals. However, in other embodiments described in more detail below, the machine position

                                                 -11
sensor 214 can operate based on other technologies. In an embodiment, the machine position
sensor 214 may be associated with a particular part or component of the excavating machine 100
such as, for example, the digging tool 110 to provide precise machine position data with respect
to that particular component. In another embodiment, the machine position data can be
determined from the general position of the excavating machine 100 at the excavation site and
data obtained from kinematic maps describing the precise position of the digging tool 110 at the
relevant time. For example, the machine position data may reflect the swing position or swing
angle of the digging tool 110 with respect to the swing axis 162 of the excavating machine 100.
[0022]     In addition to the machine position sensor 214, the excavating machine 100 may be
associated with a material sensor 216 disposed on the machine to sense characteristics or
properties of the material removed by the digging tool 110. The material sensor may be disposed
proximate to the bucket and sense properties such as the weight or quantify of the material
removed and receive into the digging tool during a digging event, e.g. a weigh sensor. In another
embodiment, the material sensor 216 can sense particular qualities associated with the material
such as density, granularity, type, composition or substance, or physical structure or chemical
makeup of the material, which may indicate if and how much of the removed material is of the
kind desire, e.g., ore or mineral or coal. For example, the material sensor 216 can utilize x-ray
diffraction, audio or sonic waves, electromagnetic waves, laser scanning, or the like to sense
certain qualities of the material and can the machine controller 210 can analyze the information
received by these technologies to make determinations about the quality of the material.
[0023]     To interface or interact with an operator of the excavating machine 100, the machine
controller 210 can be operatively associated with an electronic user interface 220. The electronic
user interface 220 may be disposed at an accessible location in the operator's station 168
onboard of the excavating machine 100, although in other embodiments, it may be an off board,
handheld device configured to remotely operate the excavating machine 100. The electronic user
interface 220 can include various components to interface with the operator such as a display
screen 222, which may be a liquid crystal display with touch screen capabilities. The electronic
user interface 220 may also include various dials, switches, or buttons 224 through which
commands may be entered. To further facilitate communication with the operator, the electronic
user interface 220 can be associated with one or more warning indicators or alarms 226, which
may be audible or visual in nature.

                                                 -12
 [0024]    In an embodiment, to integrate the machine controller 210 with operation of the
excavating machine 100, the machine controller 210 can be operatively associated with the
components used to physically direct operation of the excavating machine 100. For example, the
machine controller 210 can be in communication with one or more input devices 228 such as
joysticks, steering wheels, gear selectors, pedals, and the like by which the operator directs
movements and operation of the excavating machine 100. Accordingly, the machine controller
210 receives current information indicating the task or operation the machine is being directed to
perform. In a further embodiment, the machine controller 210 may also be operatively associated
with the continuous tracks 116 or other traction or propulsion devices included with the
excavating machine 100.
 [0025]    To enable the IPCC 102 to interact with the guidance system 200 via the excavation
network 202, the IPCC 102 can also be equipped with similar electronic and digital onboard
components. Furthermore, to utilize the dual-hopper configuration, the electronic components
can be specifically associated with the first hopper 170 or the second hopper 172. For example,
the first hopper 170 and the first material processing device 180 associated with it can be
operatively associated with a first hopper controller 240 that can have a similar electronic
architecture as the machine controller 210 and can include circuitry to execute various software
instructions, programs, routines, functions, processes and the like. To enable communication
with the excavation network 202, the first hopper controller 240 can be operatively associated
with a communication device that may also be embodied as a first hopper transmitter/receiver
242 that can send and receive radio frequency or other communication signals. To assess or
determine the location of the first hopper 170 with respect to the excavation site 104, particularly
with respect to the excavating machine 100 and the second hopper 172, the first hopper
controller 240 can communicate with a first hopper location sensor 244. The first hopper location
sensor 244 can also operate based on use of Global Navigation Satellite System ("GNSS") or any
other suitable positioning technology.
 [0026]    The first hopper controller 240 may be integrated with the other components and
systems on the IPCC 102, for example, by including a first hopper status sensor 246 operatively
associated with the first hopper 170 and/or the attached first material processing device 180 to
monitor the operating conditions of those devices. The first hopper status sensor 246 can monitor
parameters, characteristics and settings of the first hopper 170 and the first material processing

                                                  -13
device 180 to generate and communicate first hopper data 248 associated with operation of the
first hopper 17. The first hopper data 248 can be embodied as transmittable digital or analog
signals reflecting information regarding the status of the first hopper 170 and/or its associated
first material processing device 180. For example, the first hopper data 248 may reflect
information such as hopper volume, hopper capacity, hopper processing rate, and hopper
configuration data regarding the type or grade of material that can be processed, and similar
information. In an embodiment, the first hopper data 248 may include or be combined with the
hopper location information determined by the first hopper location sensor 244.
[0027]     If the IPCC 102 is sufficiently large in scale or size, or its operation is automated, the
first hopper controller 240 can interface with an electronic user interface 250 that also includes a
display device 252 such as an LCD screen and one or more dials, switches and buttons 254 to
interact with the operator. The electronic user interface 250 may also be associated with one or
more warning indicators such as an audible or visual alarm 256. If the IPCC 102 is
independently mobile, the first hopper controller 240 can communicate with the input device 258
such as a joystick used by the operator to move or steer the IPCC 102 and can communicate with
the continuous tracks 184 or other traction devices associated with the IPCC.
[0028]     The second hopper 172 and the second material processing device 182 can be
configured similarly to the first hopper 170 and first material processing device 180 and can be
operatively associated with a second hopper controller 260 that can receive and process data and
instructions to regulate operation of the second hopper 172 and second material processing
device 182. The second hopper controller 260 can be in communication with a communications
device such as a second hopper receiver/transmitter 262 that can send and receive signals via the
excavation network 202. The second hopper controller 260 can also communicate with a second
hopper location sensor 264 that can determine the relative location of the second hopper 172 at
the excavation site 104 with respect to the excavating machine 100 and the first hopper 170. To
determine the processing status of the second hopper 172 and the second material processing
device 182, the second hopper controller 260 is associated with a second hopper status sensor
266 disposed on the second hopper 172 and/or second material processing device 182 that can
generate second hopper data 268 reflecting the above identified characteristics and values.
Likewise, to interface with an operator, the second hopper controller 260 can be operatively
associated with a second electronic user interface 270 including a second display screen 272,

                                                  -14
switches, dials and buttons 274, and an alarm 276 that are dedicated to the second hopper 172
and second material processing device 182. However, in some embodiments where the first and
second hoppers 170, 172 are part of the same IPCC 102, the first and second electronic user
interfaces 250, 270 may be a combined unit providing a single point of interaction. Relatedly,
where the first and second hoppers 170, 172 are part of distinct and independently movable first
and second IPCC units operating in parallel, the second hopper controller 260 can be in
communication with an input device 278 controlling the continuous tracks 184 associated with
the second IPCC.
[0029]     In addition to machine controller 210 and the first and second hopper controllers 240,
260, the guidance system 200 can utilize data from other sources integrated with the excavation
network 202. For example, an excavation base station 290 may be present at the excavation site
104 where comprehensive excavation site data 292 resides regarding the excavation site 104,
such as terrain data, excavation plans, material locations and the like. The excavation site data
292 may stored in an electronically readable format in a database or the like at the excavation
base station 290 and can be transmitted and supplemented by data exchanges over the excavation
network 202. In an embodiment, the excavation site data 292 can include information from
topographic or terrain excavation maps 294 regarding the location, by coordinates or otherwise,
of the different types of material present at the excavation site 104. For example, the excavation
maps 294 can identify the locations of coal, ore or mineral deposits at the excavation site 104 or
can indicate if a certain location consists primarily of overburden. The excavation site data 292
may include information about the quality of the material, such as ratios, grades, material
density, or compositions, including chemical and soil data. The excavation site data 292 may
reflect the granularity or aggregate size of the material at different locations about the excavation
site 104, such as may be obtained from prior blasting of the material. The excavation maps 294
can be three-dimensional to reflect the depth of the different materials at a particular location.
Information for the excavation maps 294 can be gathered by pre-excavation scouting and
exploration of the excavation site 104.
Industrial Applicability
[0030]     The foregoing guidance system 200 can assist or guide cooperative interaction between
the excavating machine 100 and the dual-hopper IPCC 102 during excavation. The assistance or
guidance may be embodied as a guidance indication that can be communicated to the operator of

                                                -15
the excavating machine 100 and/or the IPCC 102 and may reflect information such as which of
the first or second hoppers 170, 172 the removed material should be dispensed in or where the
excavating machine 100 should excavate material from. In other embodiments, the guidance
system 200 can automatically control and direct the excavating machine 100 to dispense material
into the selected hopper that may process and discharge the material to a secondary conveyer
system 290 or, alternatively, hauling machines. For example, referring to FIG. 4, there is
illustrated an embodiment of a dispensing process 300 or a series of processes that may be
executed by the guidance system 200 for generating guidance regarding the preferred or selected
hopper in which to dispense material from the excavating machine 100. The dispensing process
300 can be embodied as software including instructions and commands written in computer
executable programming code. In accordance with the disclosure and with reference to FIGS. 2,
3, and 4, the dispensing process 300 initially begins with a material removal step 302 to dig and
remove material from the pit wall 108 with the digging tool 110 of the excavating machine 100.
To assess or analyze information regarding the IPCC 102, the dispensing process 300 can receive
for processing the first hopper data 248 and the second hopper data 268 in a receiving hopper
data step 304. In a specific embodiment, during the receiving hopper data step 304, the guidance
system 200 can receive the first hopper data 248 and the second hopper data 268 transmitted by
the first and second hopper receiver/transmitters 242, 262 via the excavation network 202.
[0031]     In an embodiment, the dispensing process 300 can select the first or second hopper
170, 172 based on the capacity or the capability of the first and second hoppers 170, 172 to
receive material. For example, the first hopper data 248 and the second hopper data 268 may
reflect hopper capacity data regarding capacity of the first and second hoppers 170, 172 at the
relevant time to process additional material. The hopper capacity data may include hopper
volume data regarding the volume of material present and being processed in the first and second
hopper 170, 172 or throughput or rate data regarding the speed at which the first or second
hoppers 170, 172 are capable of processing and discharging the material. For example, if the first
hopper 170 recently received and is processing material from the excavating machine 100, it may
not be ready to receive additional material.
[0032]     Accordingly, the dispensing process 300 in a capacity comparison step 310 can process
or compare the hopper capacity data associated with the first hopper 170 and the second hopper
172. The capacity comparison step 310 determines which of the first and second hoppers 170,

                                                 -16
172 has capacity at the relevant time, and the dispensing process 300 proceeds to a hopper
selection step 312 in which the dispensing process 300 determines a selected hopper 314 from
the processed first and second hopper data 248, 268. The capacity comparison step 310 can
account for additional factors such as the capacity of or volume of material in the digging tool
110, or time since material was last dispensed to each of the first and second hoppers 170, 172.
In an embodiment, the digging tool 110 may be configured with a material sensor 216 to
determine information like the weight or volume of material to dispense to the hoppers or to
discern more qualitative data such as composition, consistency, or grade of material. The
capacity comparison step 310 can receive material quantity data 311 obtained from the material
sensor 216 regarding the quantity, volume, mass, weight, etc. of the material removed and
contained in the digging tool 110 to assist in comparing the hopper capacity. In accordance with
being a guidance system 200, the dispensing process 300 in a subsequent indication generation
step 316 can generate a guidance indication 318 to communicate to the operator of the
excavating machine 100. The guidance indication 318 is indicative of which of the first hopper
170 and the second hopper 172 are the selected hopper 314 as determined by the hopper
selection step 312. The guidance indication 318 can be displayed on display screen 222 included
with the electronic user interface 220 disposed on the excavating machine 100, and may appear
as a red or green arrow directing the operator to swing the excavating machine 100 toward the
selected hopper 314. As indicated above, in other embodiments, the guidance system 200 can
automatically direct the excavating machine 100 to dispense material into the selected hopper
314.
[0033]    In another embodiment, the guidance system 200 and the dispensing process 300 can
select one of the first and second hoppers 170, 172 based on proximity. For example, the first
hopper data 248 and the second hopper data 268 received by the receive hopper data step 304
can reflect hopper location data of the respective first and second hoppers 170, 172. As stated
above, the hopper location data can be determined by the first hopper location sensor 244 on the
first hopper 170 and a second hopper location sensor 264 on the second hopper 172, which may
triangulate their respective locations using satellite signals. To compare relative distances, the
guidance system 200 can receive machine position data 320 from the machine position sensor
214 that also can be determined using satellite signals. In a proximity determination step 322,
which can include a comparison sub-step 324, the dispensing process 300 can compare the
hopper location data regarding the first and second hoppers 170, 172 and the machine position
data 320 to determine which of the first and second hoppers 170, 172 the excavating machine

                                                -17
100 is nearest. In the embodiments where the machine position data 320 is specific to the digging
tool 110, the proximity determination step 322 can reflect the shortest swing angle to the nearest
hopper thereby minimizing the distance the excavating machine 100 must swing to dispense
material. The dispensing process 300 proceeds to the hopper selection step 312 to determine the
selected hopper 314 based, in this embodiment, on the proximity determination step 322. The
dispensing process 300 can also conduct the indication generation step 316 to generate a
responsive guidance indication 318.
[0034]     In an alternative embodiment, rather than using satellite signals, the guidance system
200 can rely on other positioning methods or range determining methods for determining the
selected hopper 314 from the nearer of the first hopper 170 and the second hopper 172. For
example, the machine receiver/transmitter 212 disposed on the excavating machine 100 can be
configured as an optical sensor sensitive to visual or optical data such as laser light, infrared
light, or image data. In an embodiment similar to LIDAR, the machine receiver/transmitter 212
may direct a laser beam toward the first and second hoppers 170, 172, which is reflected and
received by the machine receiver/transmitter 212. Logic associated with the machine controller
210 can process this visual form of first and second hopper data 248, 268 to determine which of
the first and second hoppers 170, 172 is nearest for dispensing material. In another embodiment,
the first and second hopper receiver/transmitters 242, 262 can emit respective first and second
hopper data 248, 268 in the form of infrared light that can be received by the machine
receiver/transmitter 212 and processed accordingly by the machine controller 210. Other
embodiments of a positioning system include ground-based positioning systems such as
pseudolites, visual perception systems such as LIDAR, stereo, camera systems, and Radar, and
ranging radios. Another embodiment may utilize sonic or acoustic waves to determine proximity
between the excavating machine 100 and the first and second hoppers 170, 172. Accordingly, in
these embodiments, the first and second hopper data may be visual or acoustic data.
[0035]     In another embodiment, the guidance system 200 and the dispensing process 300 can
determine which of the first and second hoppers 170, 172 is selected based on the type or grade
of the material being removed from the pit wall 108. To make this determination, the dispensing
process 300 can, in a receive material information step 330, obtain excavation site data 292 from
the excavation maps 294 associated with excavation base station 290. In a specific embodiment,
the excavation site data 292 can be received or input into the guidance system 200 by the

                                                 -18
machine receiver/transmitter 212 via the excavation network 202. The dispensing process 300
can also receive the machine position data 320 determined by the machine position sensor 214.
In a material determination step 332, the dispensing process 300 can compare and assess the
excavation site data 292 and the machine position data 320 to determine the grade, type, or
granularity size of material likely to be excavated by the excavating machine 100 based on its
present position. For example, the excavating machine 100 may be proximate to a vein of ore or
the like, or may be proximate to a substantial amount of overburden, such that the material
determination step 332 can determine the composition of the material removed with a sufficient
degree of confidence. In another embodiment, rather than receiving excavation site data 292, the
digging tool 110 of the excavating machine 100 can be configured with a material sensor 216 to
determine the volume, composition, or quality of the excavated material removed by the digging
tool 110. Suitable sensors include weight sensors, X-ray sensors, electromagnetic sensors, audio
wave or sonic sensors, laser scanners and the like that can determine the composition and quality
of the material in the digging tool 110. This information can be transmitted as material data 336
transmitted from the machine receiver/transmitter 212 and communicated through the excavation
network 202.
[0036]     In the present embodiment, the first hopper 170 and the second hopper 172 can be
configured to process different types of material, for example, by including different grinding
mechanisms to process harder materials such as coal or ore verses softer materials such as
overburden. In addition, the first and second hoppers 170, 172 can be configured to treat the
material differently, for example, by including different sprays, additives, or the like. To select a
suitable hopper, the first hopper data 248 and the second hopper data 268 received in the
receiving hopper data step 304 can reflect hopper configuration data regarding the first and
second hoppers 170, 172. The dispensing process 300 directs the hopper configuration data and
the results of the material determination step 332 to a data comparison step 334 that compares
the data to determine whether the material is better suited for processing through the first or
second hoppers 170, 172. The results of the data comparison step 334 are sent to the hopper
selection step 312 to determine the selected hopper 314. Additionally or alternatively, the data
comparison step 334 can receive and utilize the material information 336 obtained from the
material sensor 216 on the machine 100 to compare and select the first or second hopper 170,
172 based on their configuration.

                                                 -19
[0037]      In another aspect, the guidance system 200 can generate and provide guidance on
where the excavating machine 100 should dig based on the data associated with the first and
second hoppers 170, 172 of the IPCC 102. Referring to FIG. 5, in this embodiment, the guidance
system 200 can execute a digging process 350 that can initially receive the excavation site data
292 from the excavation maps 294 and machine position data 320 reflecting the position of the
excavating machine 100 at the excavation site 104. The digging process 350 can execute a
material determination step 352 based on the data to determine the types or grades of material
proximate to the excavating machine 100. For example, the material determination step 352
informs the guidance system 200 of what types of material such as coal, ore, or overburden are at
different locations about the excavation site 104. In a data reception step 353, the digging
process 350 also receives first hopper data 248 and second hopper data 268 associated with the
first and second hoppers 170, 172 on the IPCC 102, which may include hopper capacity data,
hopper location data, and/or hopper configuration data regarding the first and second hoppers
170, 172. In a capacity comparison step 354, the digging process 350 compares the first hopper
capacity with the second hopper capacity to determine which of the first and second hoppers 170,
172 is able to receive material.
[0038]      If the both the first and second hoppers 170, 172 can receive material, the digging
process 350 proceeds to a proximity calculation step 356 to calculate the relative proximity or
distance between the digging tool 110 of the excavating machine 100 and the first and second
hoppers 170, 172. This may reflect the angular swing distance between the digging tool 110 and
the first and second hoppers 170, 172. A subsequent determination step 358 determines which of
the first and second hoppers 170, 172 is nearest and, as a result, can determine a selected hopper
360 in a subsequent hopper selection step 362. Because the selected hopper 360 may be
configured for a particular type of material, the digging process 350 can perform a guidance
generation step 364 that compares the selected hopper 360 with the results of the material
determination step 352. The guidance generation step 364 can generate a guidance indication in
the form of a target digging location 366 for excavating material suitable for the selected hopper
360. Accordingly, the target digging location 366 can direct the excavating machine 100 to
swing or otherwise move to a location in accordance with the capacity and configuration of the
selected hopper 360. In an embodiment, the target digging location 366 can be displayed on the
display screen 222 of the electronic user interface 220 as coordinates, overlays, or the like while
in other embodiments, the machine controller 210 can utilize the target digging location 366 to
automatically direct the excavating machine to excavate at the desired location.

                                                  -20
[0039]     If, however, the digging process 350 during the capacity comparison step 354 is
indeterminate, the digging process 350 can proceed to a refinement step 370 which attempts to
refine the comparison between the first hopper 170 and the second hopper 172 based on, for
example, hopper capacity or hopper location. In particular, the refinement step 370 can compare
the first hopper data 248 and the second hopper data 268 to determine which is more suitable for
presently receiving material. The results of the refinement step 370 are directed to hopper
selection step 362 to determine the selected hopper 360 from between the first hopper 170 and
the second hopper 172. As before, the selected hopper 360 and the results of the material
determination step 352 can be processed by the guidance generation step 364 to determine a
target digging location 366 for digging.
[0040]     Accordingly, the foregoing disclosure provides operator assistance or guidance for
excavating material with a dual-hopper IPCC through the interaction of communication devices,
sensors and logic deceives associated with the equipment at the excavation site. The guidance
system enables efficient use of the first hopper and the second hopper to maximize output of the
excavation operation.
