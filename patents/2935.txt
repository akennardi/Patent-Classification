                                        "A centrifuge basket"
Technical Field
[0001]    This disclosure relates, generally, to separation equipment and, more particularly, to a
centrifuge basket for separation equipment.
Background
[0002]    Centrifuge-type screening is used to separate liquid phase material from solids to reduce
the moisture content of such solids. Such a process is commonly referred to as dewatering.
Efficiently dewatering ores and minerals improves the recovery of those ores and minerals.
[0003]    However, such materials are extremely abrasive and can, as a result, reduce the life of
separation equipment used to effect the screening.
Summary
[0004]    In some aspects of the disclosure, there is provided a centrifuge basket which includes
          a support structure defining a pair of opposed ends, an opening being arranged at a first
end of the support structure;
          a screening arrangement lining the structure and defining a screening surface in an
interior of the basket, the screening arrangement comprising a plurality of screening elements,
adjacent screening elements defining a screening slot between them to provide a plurality of
spaced, parallel screening slots extending between the ends of the support structure, and each
slot being arranged at an acute angle relative to an edge of the screening arrangement which
forms a perimeter of the opening at the first end of the support structure; and
          a plurality of agitator bars arranged on the screening surface of the screening
arrangement.
[0005]    It will be appreciated that, when reference is made to the screening slots extending
between the ends of the support structure, that terminology is intended to encompass applications
where the screening slots extend between, but terminate short of, one or both ends of the support
structure.
[0006]    The support structure may comprise a framework. The framework may be in the form
of a frustum, the first end of the support structure forming a base of the frustum with a second
end of the frustum also being open. In use, the second end may be closed off by a mounting
plate against which are material to be separated impinges.

                                                     2
[0007]     The screening arrangement may be made up of a plurality of discrete panels, each panel
defining the screening slots. Each panel may have a longer, first edge and an opposed parallel,
shorter, second edge with sides tapering towards the second edge, an included angle between
each screening slot and one of the sides being greater than about 200. The included angle may
lie in a range between about 25' to 75'. In some embodiments, the included angle lies in a range
between about 30' to 600. In an embodiment, the included angle may be about 300. However, in
other embodiments, the included angle may range from about 25' to 30', 300 to 350, 350 to 400,
400 to 450, 450 to 600, 600 to 650, 650 to 700, or 700 to 75'.
[0008]     The screening slots may extend uninterruptedly between the ends of the support
structure. Each screening element may be in the form of a profiled wire.
[0009]     In an aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a screening panel for a centrifuge
basket, the screening panel including:
           a body having a pair of opposed edges, a first edge being longer than a second edge and
a pair of sides tapering towards the second edge, the body comprising a plurality of screening
elements defining a screening surface and adjacent screening elements defining a screening slot
between them to provide a plurality of spaced, parallel screening slots with an included angle
between each screening slot and one of the sides being an acute angle greater than about 200; and
           a plurality of agitator bars arranged on the screening surface of the body.
[0010]     The disclosure extends also to separation equipment which includes a centrifuge basket
as described above.

Detailed Description of Exemplary Embodiments
[0017]     In the drawings, reference numeral 10 generally designates an embodiment of a
centrifuge basket. The centrifuge basket 10 includes a support structure 12 defining a pair of
opposed ends 14 and 16. The end 14 defines a materials inlet opening 18 (Fig. 1). The opposed
end 16 of the support structure 12 is also open but, in use, is secured to a backing plate (not
shown) against which material can impinge.
[0018]     A screening arrangement 20 lines an interior surface of the support structure 12. The
screening arrangement 20 defines a plurality of spaced, parallel screening slots 22. The slots 22
extend between the ends 14 and 16 of the support structure 12. Each slot 22 is arranged at an
acute angle relative to an edge 24 of the screening arrangement 20, the edge 24 forming a
perimeter of the opening 18 at the end 14 of the support structure 12.
[0019]     In an embodiment, the support structure 12 is in the form of a framework 26 of a wear
resistant material such as a suitable steel material. The framework 26 of the support structure 12
comprises a pair of opposed annular elements, or rings 28 and 30 defining the ends 14 and 16,
respectively. The ring 28 is of a larger diameter than the ring 30 so that the framework 26 of the
support structure 12 adopts the shape of a frustum with the ring 28 forming a "base" of the
frustum.
[0020]     The ring 30 mounts a collar 32 to which a plurality of strengthening elements, in the
form of strengthening bars, 34 are connected, the bars 34 extending to, and supporting, the ring
28.
[0021]     A plurality of agitator bars 36 and 38 (Fig. 3) are arranged operatively inwardly of a
screening surface of the screening arrangement 20. The agitator bars 36 extend between the
rings 28 and 30, i.e. the full length of the basket 10. The bars 38 are mounted to the ring 30 and
extend a short distance from the ring 30. The agitator bars 36 and 38 serve to agitate material
received in the interior of the basket 10 to inhibit caking of the material on the inner surface of
the screening arrangement 20 and to improve moisture extraction from the material. It is to be
noted that the bars 38 are omitted from Fig. 1 for the sake of clarity.

                                                   4
[0022]    The screening arrangement 20 comprises a plurality of discrete panels 40 (Fig. 4).
Typically, four such panels 40 are provided to make up the screening arrangement 20. Each
panel 40 is fabricated from a sheet of Vee-Wire* screen 48 (Vee-Wire is a registered trade mark
of Johnson Screens, Inc, 2000 St James Place, Houston, TX, 77056, USA). The sheet is formed
into the shape shown in Fig. 4 having a pair of parallel edges 24 and 42 which are arcuate and
rectilinear side edges 44, 46 which taper towards each other from the edge 24 to the edge 42.
[0023]    The Vee-Wire* screen 48 is made up of a plurality of profiled screening elements of a
suitable metal, such as stainless steel. More particularly, each screening element is in the form
of a substantially V-shaped screening bar 50. Adjacent screening bars 50 define one of the slots
22 between them. The screening bars 50 are supported on support bars 51 (Figs. 1 and 2).
[0024]    With the arrangement of panel 40, as described above, an included angle, A, between
each slot 22 and the side 44 of the panel 40 is an acute angle of greater than about 200 but less
than about 75'. In an embodiment, the included angle, A, is about 30'. As a result, the slots 22
extend at an angle from the opening 18 to the opening 16, rather than being orthogonally
arranged relative to those openings.
[0025]    This results in slots 22 of increased length which, consequently, leads to an improved
utilisation of the open area of the screening arrangement 20 resulting in improved moisture
extraction from the material injected into the interior of the centrifuge basket 10 in the direction
of arrow 52 (Fig. 2), in use.
[0026]    In use, the centrifuge basket 10 is mounted to rotate about a substantially horizontal
rotational axis 54 (Fig. 2). Material to be screened is inserted into the centrifuge basket 10, in
the direction of the arrow 52, via the opening 18 to impinge on the screening arrangement 20.
Rotation of the centrifuge basket 10 results in moisture being extracted from the material and
expelled through the screening slots 22. Remaining material, having a lower moisture content, is
discharged from the centrifuge basket 10 at an operatively bottom edge, or lip, 56 (Fig. 2) of the
opening 18 for further processing.
[0027]    Continued rotation of the centrifuge basket 10 about the rotational axis 54 causes the
material to impact against the agitation bars 36 and 38 which inhibits caking of the material on
the screening surface of the screening arrangement 22, results in continued agitation of the

                                                   5
material and allows additional moisture to be extracted from the material and expelled through
the slots 22 of the screening arrangement 20.
[0028]    It is an advantage of the described embodiment that, as described above, longer
screening slots 22 which provides an improved utilisation of the open area of the screening
arrangement 20 of the centrifuge basket 10. In addition, because the slots 22 are arranged at an
angle relative to the inflow of material, the material does not impact at right angles to leading
edges 58 (Fig. 5 of the screening bars 50 of the screening arrangement 20. This results in
reduced impact damage to the screening bars 50 improving the working life of the screening
arrangement 20 and, hence, the centrifuge basket 10. It will be appreciated that impacts of
sufficiently high force on the screening bars 50 could result in the bars being damaged causing
an increase in the width of the screening slots 22. Material which otherwise would be available
for processing could thus be lost through those slots of increased width.
[0029]    It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or
modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments, without departing from the
broad general scope of the present disclosure. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be
considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.
