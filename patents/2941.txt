FIELD OF                 INVENTION
 [0002]               This           disclosure           relates         to     a    mechanism            to
control                 the        position        of    a   scraper         chain      conveyor          and
for          detection                   and    adjustment           of      the     tension          of    a
scraper chain of a chain conveyor.
BACKGROUND
 [0003]               Conveyors,              such     as   armored        face     conveyors,            are
part            of           an       integrated           longwall           system        that       also
comprises a coal-cutting machine and roof supports.                                                        As
the         longwall                 system       removes       mineral         from     the     mineral
block             one           strip        (web)      at    a    time,        the     load       on     the
                                                            1

conveyor                     changes           as     the     cutter         moves      along       the
conveyor.                     The conveyor progressively moves                         forward one
web in order to reposition itself for the next cut.
 [0004]               The         mineral       being mined        is     dragged     along      a  top
race          of the conveyor by a continuous chain and flight
bar          assembly               driven         by   sprockets         at  each     end     of   the
conveyor.                     More particularly, spaced apart chains, with
the         flight             bars     connecting          the   chains,       are typical.          At
the          delivery                end,      the    mineral      is      discharged        onto     an
adjacent                  conveyor           while      the   continuous         chain      enters      a
bottom race                       where     it     proceeds     to a       return   end,      where      a
return              end         drum     or     sprocket       reverses       the   direction         of
the chain.
 [0005]               Armored           face        conveyors      normally        operate        at    a
fixed              overall              length          (sprocket        centers),        but      more
usually                they         are    fitted        with   an    extendable        return      end
frame.                 The purpose of                 the extendable           return end frame
is         to         take-up            slack        chain     generated         during       normal
operations.                             The         variations           in     load       and      the
repositioning of the many parts of the conveying system
result              in       changes         in     chain    tensions.          To  ensure       slack
chain            is       not       produced,          the   movement        of  the    extendable
return             end          frame     is      sometimes      automatically          controlled
to maintain a fixed chain tension.
 [0006]               This         repeated action involves the repositioning
of        the          many         parts        that     make-up       the     total     conveying
system.                     Keeping          the     equipment        inline      with     the     coal
block is                  difficult,             as no direct          steering mechanism is
available                    with      these        systems.        The      operators       have     to
rely           on         their         experience          by    adjusting        the      relative

position                     of      the       conveyor        to       the       coal         block       to
counteract                      a    tendency        of    the     equipment           to       gradually
creep sideways.                            This   inevitably           results in            face      creep
with            the           only         corrective         action          available           to     the
operators being to angle the conveyor a few degrees off
square                to        the      coal    block.           This        is    very        slow     and
extremely difficult to gauge.
 [0007]                In      certain         operational         situations,              one     of   the
two chains of the chain and flight bar assembly may get
broken              on       the      top     race.      The    remaining chain                  can    then
enter            the          return         race    with     the     broken          chain.           Lower
tensions                  in       the     bottom      race     can     be      contained          by    the
single               chain,            which     continues         to     the      return         end    and
then over the return end sprocket.                                          If the broken chain
is       not         identified              on  the     top    race,        the    result        will     be
failure                of the          second chain,          which        is    most      likely       when
it       approaches                   the     discharge       area.           Consequence           damage
to         related                 equipment         can     then       occur.             Failure         is
followed                   by       prolonged         down     time        to     make        a    repair.
Visual              identification                of the       broken         chain     is      possible,
but         is      unlikely              because      the    chain       is     covered         with    the
mineral                   being            conveyed.             Additionally,                  on      most
installations,                         safety       requirements             prohibit           operators
from           being              adjacent       the     return       end       of    the       conveyor,
which               further               reduces       the      opportunity               for      manual
detection.

apparatus                      or      assembly          is       shown        generally        by     the
character numeral 10 and includes a drive drum/sprocket
12      and an idler                     or guide        drum/sprocket              14   separated      by
a span of a flexible conveyor 16,                                         illustrated partially
in       dashed line                    outline.          As     depicted, the            conveyor      16
comprises dual conveyor chains 18 and a multiplicity of
spaced              flight            bars    20     attached          to   the    dual     chains     18.
During              operation              of    the     conveyor         assembly,        the   flight
bars          20        push          aggregate        material,           such      as   mined    coal,
along             an         underlying            conveyor           pan    21.        The    conveyor
assembly                   10      is    typically           positioned           juxtaposed        to    a
mine         wall where                  a   seam     of material             is   being      mined    for
transporting the material to one                                         end.       The material        is
then          transferred                  to    an    auxiliary          conveyor        for   further
disposition.

to       a     conveyor                drive     motor        22.        Operation        of   motor    22
causes              the          sprocket        intermeshing             with     the    dual   chains

upon            the            direction               of     adjusting           movement            of     the
supporting                     drum/sprockets                 with      respect         to     each     other.
To       provide                 this       relative          movement,         assembly           10     has  a
tensioning                     means         in     the     form      of     a   pair        of    hydraulic
cylinders                    28 and 30,              each mounted on              and secured to an
adjacent                    sidewall              26.          In     other        embodiments              (not
shown),                only          a   single         hydraulic          cylinder          can    be    used.
The         cylinders                  have      respective           pistons         32     and    34,    each
of which is operatively coupled to a sidewall 24                                                        in any
known and expedient manner.
 [0011]               Movement              of     the     pistons         32   and       34     causes      the
first            portion                of    the       conveyor         16    represented             by    the
side          walls              24     to    move       longitudinally               relative         to    the
second               portion               and      side      walls       26,     thus         relaxing       or
tensioning                       the        chain        18,      as     desired.               Control       of
movement                    of        pistons           32     and      34     is       affected          by   a
conventional                          hydraulic           tensioning           control           circuitry,
depicted generally by numeral 40                                          in Figure 1.
 [0012]               As stated above, a certain amount of tensioning
of       conveyor                  chain        18    is    essential          for      the      proper      and
efficient                    operation             of    the     conveyor        assembly           10.      Too
little tension may cause the conveyor                                               chain to ride             up

much          tension               may       cause       the     conveyor          components         to    be
over             stressed,                  increasing             the        risk      of    mechanical
failure in the various parts of the conveyor apparatus.

SUMMARY
 [0020]               The present invention provides a sensor
assembly for a chain conveyor, the chain conveyor
including a frame and a chain having a plurality of
flights, the tension sensor comprising:                  a load
receiving member configured to be coupled to the frame,
the load-receiving member being positioned adjacent the
conveyor chain and configured to contact the flights as
the flights move past the load-receiving member, the
flights                contacting the load-receiving member exerting a
force on the load-receiving member, the load-receiving
member including a load pad;                   a load sensor coupled to

disclosure                      is    to    provide         a    device       for    detecting       and
adjusting                     the      tension         of      the      scraper       chain,      which
determines                      the     tension       reliably          and     simply.         Another
object              of       this      disclosure           is    to    provide      such     a  device
that          reliably               senses        chain       tension       while      at   the    same
time not adversely affecting the chain path.
 [0027]               This          disclosure            also        provides        a     means      of
identifying                        broken         chain        as     it    leaves       the     return
sprocket and enters the top race of the conveyor.                                                   When
detected, the chain can be stopped automatically by the
armored                  face        conveyor         control          system,       to    avoid     the
potential                    for      further       damage,          and    warn     the    operators
that repair of the chain is required.
 [0028]               Another           principal         object        of   this    disclosure        is
to provide sliding                            frames       at both ends            of the conveyor
to allow the conveyor ends to be independently adjusted
to each end of the coal block, whilst maintaining good
chain tension and control.
 [0029]               Providing             the     delivery          and     return      end    frames
with a telescopic section addresses the problem of face
creep            by        allowing           the    operator          to   quickly       adjust     the
position                  of both ends             of    the conveyor, thus offsetting
the          effects                of     face      creep.             This      is   particularly
critical                      on       conventional               end      discharge          conveyor
systems,                   where         the      correct         relationship          between      the
longwall                    discharge           conveyor            and    an     auxiliary        cross
conveyor                  (beam stage             loader)        must be       maintained.          This
problem                becomes           even more         critical        where     there      are  two

wear          strip             support           112      by     a     pin    116    at    one        end     and a
load-sensing pin 120 at                                     the other end.                  The      wear plate
108         engages                 the      top       surface           of   the     conveyor             16,   and
changes                the         path       or     trajectory             of    the    movement            of  the
conveyor                  16.           This       contact          and change           in      direction         of
the         conveyor                  16     causes         a    force        to    be     applied           on  the
wear plate                     108.         The       load-sensing pin 120 that connects
the wear plate                           108 to the wear strip support                                112     senses

and the wear strip support                                      136.         More particularly, the
wear           strip               support           136      includes              a    cavity       138      that
receives                 the         load cells            128,      and the           wear plate           132    is
connected                    to      the     wear       strip       support            136 by means            of     a

 [0044]               Figure             5  illustrates              a    perspective             view     of    the

the return end 51.                                 As     shown, the cavity                    138 receiving
the load cells                           128 can be formed by a plate 142                                 secured

Each tension sensor 124 is electrically connected via a

 [0046]                In the preferred embodiment,                                  as    illustrated in
figure              7,        the       part       of    the     conveyor           that      contacts          the
tension sensor 124                               is the end or tip of the flight bar
20.         In       other           embodiments,              not     shown,         a    tension        sensor
124         can be placed above each of                                   the chains,              instead of
the         flight               tips.           The     tip      of    the     flight         bar     20     will
only            contact                 the        wear       strip       intermittently.                   As      a
result,                  the           tension          sensor         124      will         only       produce
intermittent signals.
 [0047]               To eliminate transient load spikes and to allow
for         the         odd missing                 flight       bar     20,      the      tension        sensor
124         collects                 a     rolling         average        reading          over      20    or     so
flight              bars.              As     each      flight       bar     tip passes              along the
load           sensor,                 even        at    a    constant          chain        tension,           the
signal                varies             due       to      the     changing           geometry           of     the
system.                  The tension sensor 124                          records the peak signal
value           as each                flight bar 20 passes over the wear plate
132.              If       the        rolling          average       peak      reading          is    too low,
then          the          tension             means       moves      the     joint         48     to   stretch
the          chain,                or       vice       versa.            The        tension          means        is
initialized                        by       establishing             a     required            peak       signal
value by                  stopping the conveyor with a                                 flight bar under
the sensor,                        fitting a temporary                    load transducer to the
chain            itself,               and then moving                 the     joint        48     to   tension
the         static               chain.            When      the    chain        is      at   the     required
tension, the tension sensor                                        124    stores the             signal,        and
it       is        this            signal         value       that      the     tension            sensor       124

 [0048]               The         above     overview        is     a    simplified            version       of
the          sensor               signal     management            system,          and      applies        to
steady             chain           load increase            or    decrease          during the           coal
cutting                 cycle.          The   tension         sensor         124    must        also     deal
with special events such as starting a full conveyor or
the          rapid               unloading          of    a     conveyor,           like         when     the
shearer                  stops         cutting.         Collecting            a    rolling          average
signal cannot respond quickly enough to deal with these
events,                 so      advance       action       must      be     taken.        For     example,
the         sprocket                is   extended        to     significantly               stretch       the
chain               before              loaded        conveyor            startup          to       prevent
generation of slack chain.
 [0049]                In      the     event      of   a   chain       break,        the      tension       in
the         two         chains          18   will      be   different.               The      outputs       of
the         tension                sensors        124    are      compared          by     a     comparing
means,                  comparator              158,       and        in      the       event          of     a
significant                       difference,         the     operation          of the          conveying
apparatus                    10    can be      stopped so the broken chain can be
repaired.                         In    the    preferred           embodiment,             the      tension

the output from the tension sensors                                          124    can be averaged

various adjustments in order to try to accommodate such

to       accommodate                   some movement             of   the      conveyor         apparatus
210          relative                 to      the      auxiliary            conveyor           200,      the
conveyor                  apparatus           frame       accommodates            sliding        movement
at both ends.                         At one end, the sliding movement adjusts
the tension of the conveyor 16,                                      and sliding movement at
the         other              end     accommodates            movement           of      the    conveyor
apparatus                    210     relative         to    the     auxiliary           conveyor        200.
If       the           conveyor            apparatus          210     moves        relative         to   the
auxiliary                      conveyor          200,       an     operator            can     move      the
sliding end of the                             conveyor        210 adjacent              the auxiliary
conveyor                   200.           Movement         of     the      sliding          end     of   the
conveyor                   210       can      also     be     occasioned             by     the     use    of
tensioning                     means,       as   described          hereinafter,             as used on
the tensioning end 51 of the conveyor                                            16.       Only in this
instance,                    the     movement         is     not     intended          to    effect      the
tension of the conveyor 16, but the location of the end
of the conveyor apparatus 210 relative to the auxiliary

conveyor                    200.             When        movement          at      this     end    of   the
conveyor                  occurs, the chain tension does                                change,     so the
other end of the conveyor apparatus                                              210 is adjusted by
the         automatic                  tensioning            means      to     return      the    conveyor

is appropriately coupled to a conveyor drive motor 322.
Operation of motor 322                                  causes the sprocket intermeshing
with          the           dual         chains         18   to    advance          the    conveyor     16.

relative                     to      the     auxiliary          conveyor      is     especially
relevant                  where         a   pair    of   conveyor       apparatus      is    used.
As illustrated in Figures 10 A and 10 B, it is known to
use         one          conveyor           adjacent       a   coal    face,    and    a    second
conveyor                  apparatus          behind the         roof supports to           collect
coal that falls from the longwall roof as the longwall
advances.                       In    this    instance,        the   double     sliding      frame
ends would be used with both conveyor apparatus.
 [0056]               Additionally             the     frame-sliding         48   and     348   can
be       adjusted                  to    correctly      align      the   conveyor      end with
both          edges              of    the   coal block,          moving    both    the     return
end frame                     and delivery           end     frame    at  the    same     time   to
maintain                  correct          chain tension during this adjustment.
This          would               not     be   a    normal       requirement       or    mode    of
operation                    as     the     position      of    the   Return     End Frame       to
coal block is less critical in most cases.
 [0057]               This          aspect      of    the      disclosure      thus      has    the
following benefits.                            Manual or automatic control of the
delivery                      end         frame       sliding        module       makes       fine
adjustments                       for optimum discharge              of material        from the
extendable                     longwall       armored        face conveyor       to the cross
beam stage loader conveyor.
 [0058]                Since the changes                in    the overall       length of the
conveyor,                    as      a    result     of   adjusting       the    delivery       end
