        Field of the Invention
[0001 ]          The present invention relates generally to the field of therapeutics for
        hemostatic disorders.
        Background Art
[0002]           Hemophilia A is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by mutations and/or
         deletions in the factor VIII (FVIII) gene resulting in a deficiency of FVIII activity
         (Peyvandi et al. 2006). The disease is characterized by spontaneous hemorrhage and
         excessive bleeding after trauma. Over time, the repeated bleeding into muscles and
        joints, which often begins in early childhood, results in hemophilic arthropathy and
         irreversible joint damage. This damage is progressive and can lead to severely limited
        mobility of joints, muscle atrophy and chronic pain (Rodriguez-Merchan, E.G., Semin.
         Thromb. Hemost. 29:87-96 (2003), which is herein incorporated by reference in its
         entirety).
[0003]           The A2 domain is necessary for the procoagulant activity of the factor VIII
        molecule. Studies show that porcine factor VIII has six-fold greater procoagulant
         activity than human factor VIII (Lollar, P., and E. T. Parker, J. Biol. Chem.
        266:12481-12486 (1991)), and that the difference in coagulant activity between human

                                             - la
       and porcine factor VIII appears to be based on a difference in amino acid sequence
       between one or more residues in the human and porcine A2 domains (Lollar, P., et al.,
       J. Biol. Chem. 267:23652-23657 (1992)), incorporated herein by reference in its
       entirety.
[0004]         Treatment of hemophilia A is by replacement therapy targeting restoration of
       FVIII activity to 1 to 5 % of normal levels to prevent spontaneous bleeding (Mannucci,
       P.M., et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 344: 1773-1779 (2001), which is herein incorporated by
       reference in its entirety). There are plasma-derived and recombinant FVIII products
       available to treat bleeding episodes on-demand or to prevent bleeding episodes from
       occurring by treating prophylactically. Based on the half-life of these products
       treatment
                                  [Text continues on page 2.]

                                                -2
       regimens require frequent intravenous administration.       Such frequent administration is
       painful and inconvenient.
[0005]         Reduced mortality, prevention of joint damage and improved quality of life have
       been important achievements due to the development of plasma-derived and recombinant
       FVIII. Prolonged protection from bleeding would represent another key advancement in
       the treatment of hemophilia A patients.       However, to date, no products that allow for
       prolonged protection have been developed. Therefore, there remains a need for improved
       methods of treating hemophilia due to factor VIII deficiency that are more tolerable and
       more effective than current therapies.
                       BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[00061         The present invention provides methods of administering Factor VIII; methods of
       administering chimeric polypeptides comprising Factor VIII and hybrids of such chimeric
       polypeptides; chimeric polypeptides comprising Factor VIII and hybrids of such chimeric
       polypeptides; polynucleotides encoding such chimeric and hybrid polypeptides; cells
       comprising such polynucleotides; and methods of producing such chimeric and hybrid
       polypeptides using such cells.
[0007]         The present invention provides a method of administering Factor VIII to a subject
       in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic dose of a chimeric
       Factor VIII polypeptide, e.g., a chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptide, at a dosing interval
       at least about one and one-half times longer than the dosing interval required for an
       equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion (a polypeptide
       consisting of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., without the Fc portion.
[00081         The dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half to six times longer, one
       and one-half to five times longer, one and one-half to four times longer, one and one-half
       to three times longer, or one and one-half to two times longer, than the dosing interval
       required for an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion
       (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., the Fc portion. The dosing
       interval may be at least about one and one-half, two, two and one-half, three, three and
       one-half, four, four and one-half, five, five and one-half or six times longer than the
       dosing interval required for an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without the non
       Factor VIII portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., the Fc

                                                 -3
       portion. The dosing interval may be about every five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
       twelve, thirteen, or fourteen days or longer.
[00091          The dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half to 5, one and one-half,
       2, 3, 4, or 5 days or longer.
[00101          The present invention also provides a method of administering Factor VIII to a
       subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic dose of a
       chimeric Factor VIII polypeptide, e.g., a chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptide, to obtain
       an area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) at least about one and
       one-quarter times greater than the AUC obtained by an equivalent amount of said Factor
       VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII
       portion), e.g., without the Fc portion.
[00111          The present invention also provides a method of administering Factor VIII to a
       subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic dose of a
       polypeptide comprising a Factor VIII and an Fc at a dosing interval of about every five,
       six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, or fourteen days or longer.
[00121          The methods of the invention may be practiced on a subject in need of
       prophylactic treatment or on-demand treatment.
[00131          On-demand treatment includes treatment for a bleeding episode, hemarthrosis,
       muscle bleed, oral bleed, hemorrhage, hemorrhage into muscles, oral hemorrhage,
       trauma, trauma capitis (head trauma), gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage,
       intra-abdominal hemorrhage, intrathoracic hemorrhage, bone fracture, central nervous
       system bleeding, bleeding in the retropharyngeal space, bleeding in the retroperitoneal
       space, or bleeding in the illiopsoas sheath.        The subject may be in need of surgical
       prophylaxis, peri-operative management, or treatment for surgery.              Such surgeries
       include, e.g., minor surgery, major surgery, tooth extraction, tonsillectomy, inguinal
       herniotomy, synovectomy, total knee replacement, craniotomy, osteosynthesis, trauma
       surgery, intracranial surgery, intra-abdominal surgery, intrathoracic surgery, or joint
       replacement surgery.
[00141          For on-demand treatment, the dosing interval of said chimeric polypeptide is
       about once every 24-36, 24-48, 24-72, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,
       37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60,
       61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, or 72 hours or longer.

                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0041]         The present invention provides a method of treating Hemophilia A with Factor
       VIII using a longer dosing interval and/or greater AUC than is possible with currently
       known Factor VIII products. The present invention also provides improved Factor VIII
       chimeric polypeptides, Factor VIII chimeric polynucleotides, and methods of production.
[0042]         Treatment of hemophilia A is by replacement therapy targeting restoration of
       FVIII activity to 1 to 5 % of normal levels to prevent spontaneous bleeding (Mannucci,
       P.M., et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 344:1773-9 (2001), herein incorporated by reference in its
       entirety).  There are plasma-derived and recombinant FVIII products available to treat
       bleeding episodes on-demand or to prevent bleeding episodes from occurring by treating
       prophylactically. Based on the half-life of these products (10-12 hr) (White G.C., et al.,
       Thromb. Haemost. 77:660-7 (1997); Morfini, M., Haemophilia 9 (suppl 1):94-99;
       discussion 100 (2003)), treatment regimens require frequent intravenous administration,
       commonly two to three times weekly for prophylaxis and one to three times daily for on
       demand treatment (Manco-Johnson, M.J., et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 357:535-544 (2007)),
       each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.          Such frequent
       administration is painful and inconvenient.
[00431         The present invention provides a method of administering Factor VIII to a subject
       in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic dose of a chimeric
       Factor VIII polypeptide, e.g., a chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptide, or a hybrid of such a
       polypeptide at a dosing interval at least about one and one-half times longer than the

                                                -8
       dosing interval required for an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without the non
       Factor VIII portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., without
       the Fc portion.
[00441          The dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half to six times longer, one
       and one-half to five times longer, one and one-half to four times longer, one and one-half
       to three times longer, or one and one-half to two times longer, than the dosing interval
       required for an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion
       (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., without the Fc portion. The
       dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half, two, two and one-half, three, three
       and one-half, four, four and one-half, five, five and one-half or six times longer than the
       dosing interval required for an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without the non
       Factor VIII portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., without
       the Fe portion. The dosing interval may be about every five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
       eleven, twelve, thirteen, or fourteen days or longer.
[0045]          The dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half to 5, one and one-half,
       2, 3, 4, or 5 days or longer.
[00461          The present invention also provides a method of administering Factor VIII to a
       subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic dose of a
       chimeric Factor VIII polypeptide, e.g., a chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptide, or a hybrid
       of such a polypeptide to obtain an area under the plasma concentration versus time curve
       (AUC) at least about one and one-quarter times greater than the AUC obtained by an
       equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without non-Factor VIII portion (a polypeptide
       consisting of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., without the Fe portion.
[00471          The present invention also provides a method of administering Factor VIII to a
       subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic dose of a
       polypeptide comprising a Factor VIII and an Fe or a hybrid of such a polypeptide at a
       dosing interval of about every five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, or
       fourteen days or longer.
[00481          The methods of the invention may be practiced on a subject in need of
       prophylactic treatment or on-demand treatment.
[0049]          "Administering," as used herein, means to give a pharmaceutically acceptable
       Factor VIII polypeptide of the invention to a subject via a pharmaceutically acceptable

                                               -9
       route. Preferred routes of administration are intravenous, e.g., intravenous injection and
       intravenous infusion. Additional routes of administration include, e.g., subcutaneous,
       intramuscular, oral, nasal, and pulmonary administration.      Chimeric polypeptides and
       hybrid proteins may be administered as part of a pharmaceutical composition comprising
       at least one excipient.
[00501          "Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC)," as used herein,
       is the same as the term of art in pharmacology, and is based upon the rate and extent of
       absorption if factor VIII following administration. AUC is determined over a specified
       time period, such as 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, or 72 hours, or for infinity using extrapolation
       based on the slope of the curve. Unless otherwise specified herein, AUC is determined
       for infinity. The determination of AUC may be carried out in a single subject, or in a
       population of subjects for which the average is calculated.
[00511          "B domain" of Factor VIII, as used herein, is the same as the B domain known in
       the art that is defined by internal amino acid sequence identity and sites of proteolytic
       cleavage by thrombin, e.g., residues Ser741-Arg1648 of full length human factor VIII.
       The other human factor VIII domains are defined by the following amino acid residues:
       Al, residues Alal-Arg372; A2, residues Ser373-Arg740; A3, residues Ser1690-Ile2032;
       C1, residues Arg2033-Asn2172; C2, residues Ser2173-Tyr2332. The A3-C1-C2 sequence
       includes residues Serl690-Tyr2332.         The remaining sequence, residues Glul649
       Arg1689, is usually referred to as the factor VIII light chain activation peptide. The
       locations of the boundaries for all of the domains, including the B domains, for porcine,
       mouse and canine factor VIII are also known in the art. Preferably, the B domain of
       Factor VIII is deleted ("B domain deleted factor VIII" or "BDD FVIII"). An example of a
       BDD FVIII is REFACTO (recombinant BDD FVIII), which has the same sequence as the
       Factor VIII portion of the sequence in Table 2A(i) (amino acids -19 to 1438 or I to 1438
       of SEQ ID NO:2).
[0052]          A "B domain deleted factor VIII" may have the full or partial deletions disclosed
       in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,316,226, 6,346,513, 7,041,635, 5,789,203, 6,060,447, 5,595,886,

       and 6,458,563, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some
       embodiments, a B domain deleted factor VIII sequence of the present invention
       comprises any one of the deletions disclosed at col. 4, line 4 to col. 5, line 28 and

       embodiments, a B domain deleted factor VIII of the present invention has a deletion
       disclosed at col. 2, lines 26-51 and examples 5-8 of U.S. Patent No. 5,789,203 (also US
       6,060,447, US 5,595,886, and US 6,228,620). In some embodiments, a B domain deleted
       factor VIII has a deletion described in col. 1, lines 25 to col. 2, line 40 of US Patent No.

       6,458,563. In some embodiments, a B domain deleted factor VIII has a deletion of most
       of the B domain, but still contains amino-terminal sequences of the B domain that are
       essential for in vivo proteolytic processing of the primary translation product into two
       polypeptide chain, as disclosed in WO 91/09122, which is incorporated herein by
       reference in its entirety.      In some embodiments, a B domain deleted factor VIII is
       constructed with a deletion of amino acids 747-1638, i.e., virtually a complete deletion of
       the B domain.         Hoeben R.C., et al. J. Biol. Chem. 265 (13): 7318-7323 (1990),
       incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A B domain deleted factor VIII may also
       contain a deletion of amino acids 771-1666 or amino acids 868-1562 of factor VIII.
       Meulien P., et al. ProteinEng. 2(4): 301-6 (1988), incorporated herein by reference in its
       entirety.   Additional B domain deletions that are part of the invention include, e.g.,:
       deletion of amino acids 982 through 1562 or 760 through 1639 (Toole et al., Proc. Natl.
       Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (1986) 83, 5939-5942)), 797 through 1562 (Eaton, et al. Biochemistry
       (1986) 25:8343-8347)), 741 through 1646 (Kaufman (PCT published application No. WO
       87/04187)), 747-1560 (Sarver, et al., DNA (1987) 6:553-564)), 741 though 1648 (Pasek
       (PCT application No.88/00831)), 816 through 1598 or 741 through 1689 (Lagner
       (Behring Inst. Mitt. (1988) No 82:16-25, EP 295597)), each of which is incorporated
       herein by reference in its entirety. Each of the foregoing deletions may be made in any
       Factor VIII sequence.
[0053]          "Chimeric polypeptide," as used herein, means a polypeptide that includes within
       it at least two polypeptides (or subsequences or peptides) from different sources.

                                              -11
        Chimeric polypeptides may include, e.g., two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more
       polypeptides from different sources, such as different genes, different cDNAs, or different
       animal or other species. Chimeric polypeptides may include, e.g., one or more linkers
       joining the different subsequences.   Thus, the subsequences may be joined directly or
       they may be joined indirectly, via linkers, or both, within a single chimeric polypeptide.
       Chimeric polypeptides may include, e.g., additional peptides such as signal sequences and
       sequences such as 6His and FLAG that aid in protein purification or detection.              In
       addition, chimeric polypeptides may have amino acid or peptide additions to the N
       and/or C-termini.
[00541         In some embodiments, the chimeric polypeptide comprises a Factor VIII portion
       and a non-Factor VIII portion.    Exemplary non-Factor VIII portions include, e.g., Fe,
       XTEN, and albumin.      Exemplary chimeric polypeptides of the invention include, e.g.,
       chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptides, chimeric Factor VIII-XTEN polypeptides, and
       chimeric Factor VIII-albumin polypeptides.
[00551         Exemplary chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptides include, e.g., SEQ ID NOs:2, 6,
       8, 10, and 12 (Table 2), with or without their signal sequences and the chimeric Fc
       polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:4 (Table 2).
[0056]         The chimeric polypeptide may comprise a sequence at least 90% or 95% identical
       to the Factor VIII and Fc amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(i) without a signal
       sequence (amino acids 1 to 1665 of SEQ ID NO:2) or at least 90% or      9 5 % identical to the
       Factor VIII and Fc amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(i) with a signal sequence
       (amino acids -19 to 1665 of SEQ ID NO:2). The chimeric polypeptide may comprise a
       sequence identical to the Factor VIII and Fe amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(i)
       without a signal sequence (amino acids 1 to 1665 of SEQ ID NO:2) or identical to the
       Factor VIII and Fe amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(i) with a signal sequence
       (amino acids -19 to 1665 of SEQ ID NO:2).
[00571         As discussed above, exemplary chimeric polypeptides include Factor VIII fused to
       one or more XTEN polypeptides. Schellenburger et al., Nat. Biotech. 27:1186-90 (2009),
       which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Factor VIII can be fused to
       either the N-terminal end of the XTEN polypeptide or to the C-terminal end of the XTEN
       polypeptide, provided the Factor VIII component of the Factor VIII-XTEN fusion protein
       can be processed by an protease to yield a processed Factor VIII containing polypeptide.

                                                - 12
       A protease site may be included between the XTEN portion and the Factor VIII portion to
       allow such processing.       XTEN polypeptides include, e.g., those disclosed in WO
       2009/023270,    WO 2010/091122, WO 2007/103515,               US 2010/0189682,      and US
       2009/0092582, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[00581         As discussed above, exemplary chimeric polypeptides also include Factor VIII
       fused to one or more albumin polypeptides.       Preferably the albumin is human albumin.
       Factor VIII can be fused to either the N-terminal end of the albumin or to the C-terminal
       end of the albumin, provided the Factor VIII component of the Factor VIII-albumin
       fusion protein can be processed by an enzymatically-active proprotein convertase to yield
       a processed Factor VIII-containing polypeptide. Examples of albumin, e.g., fragments
       thereof, that may be used in the present invention are known. e.g., U.S. Patent No.
       7,592,010; U.S. Patent No. 6,686,179; and Schulte, Thrombosis Res. 124 Suppl. 2:S6-S8
       (2009), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[00591         In some embodiments, a chimeric polypeptide comprising a Factor VIII portion
       has an increased half-life (tl/2) over a polypeptide consisting of the same Factor VIII
       portion without the non Factor VIII portion. A chimeric Factor VIII polypeptide with an
       increased tl/2 may be referred to herein as a long-acting Factor VIII.           Long-acting
       chimeric Factor VIII polypeptides include, e.g., Factor VIII fused to Fc (including, e.g.,
       chimeric Factor VIII polypeptides in the form of a hybrid such as a FVIIIFc monomer
       dimer hybrid; see Example 1, Fig. 1, and Table 2A; and US Patent Nos. 7,404,956 and
       7,348,004), Factor VIII fused to XTEN, and Factor VIII fused to albumin.
[00601         "Culture," "to culture" and "culturing," as used herein, means to incubate cells
       under in vitro conditions that allow for cell growth or division or to maintain cells in a
       living state. "Cultured cells," as used herein, means cells that are propagated in vitro.
[0061]         "Factor VIII," as used herein, means functional factor VIII polypeptide in its
       normal role in coagulation, unless otherwise specified.        Thus, the term Factor VIII
       includes variant polypeptides that are functional.    Preferred factor VIII proteins are the
       human, porcine, canine, and murine factor VIII proteins. As described in the Background
       Art section, the full length polypeptide and polynucleotide sequences are known, as are
       many functional fragments, mutants and modified versions. Examples of human factor
       VIII sequences are shown as subsequences in SEQ ID NOs:2, 6, 8, 10, and 12 (Table 2).
       Factor VIII polypeptides include, e.g., full-length factor VIII, full-length factor VIII

                                                - 13
       minus Met at the N-terminus, mature factor VIII (minus the signal sequence), mature
       factor VIII with an additional Met at the N-terminus, and/or factor VIII with a full or
       partial deletion of the B domain.        Preferred Factor VIII variants include B domain
       deletions, whether partial or full deletions.
[00621         A great many functional factor VIII variants are known, as is discussed above and
       below.    In addition, hundreds of nonfunctional mutations in factor VIII have been
       identified in hemophilia patients, and it has been determined that the effect of these
       mutations on factor VIII function is due more to where they lie within the 3-dimensional
       structure of factor VIII than on the nature of the substitution (Cutler et al., Hum. Mutat.
       19:274-8 (2002)), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.             In addition,
       comparisons between factor VIII from humans and other species has identified conserved
       residues that are likely to be required for function (Cameron et al., Thromb. Haemost.
       79:317-22 (1998); US 6,251,632), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[00631         The human factor VIII gene was isolated and expressed in mammalian cells
       (Toole, J. J., et al., Nature 312:342-347 (1984); Gitschier, J., et al., Nature 312:326-330

       4,757,006), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and the
       amino acid sequence was deduced from cDNA. Capon et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,199,
       incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, disclose a recombinant DNA method for
       producing factor VIII in mammalian host cells and purification of human factor VIII.
       Human factor VIII expression in CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells and BHKC (baby
       hamster kidney cells) has been reported. Human factor VIII has been modified to delete
       part or all of the B domain (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,994,371 and 4,868,112, each of which is
       incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), and replacement of the human factor VIII
       B domain with the human factor V B domain has been performed (U.S. Pat. No.
       5,004,803, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).         The cDNA sequence
       encoding human factor VIII and predicted amino acid sequence are shown in SEQ ID
       NOs:1 and 2, respectively, of US Application Publ. No. 2005/0100990, incorporated
       herein by reference in its entirety.

[0069]         "Equivalent amount," as used herein, means the same amount of Factor VIII
       activity as expressed in International Units, which is independent of molecular weight of
       the polypeptide in question.       One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity
       corresponds approximately to the quantity of factor VIII in one milliliter of normal
       human plasma. Several assays are available for measuring Factor VIII activity, including
       the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic substrate assay and a one stage clotting assay.
[00701         "Fc," as used herein, means functional neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding
       partners, unless otherwise specified. An FcRn binding partner is any molecule that can be
       specifically bound by the FcRn receptor with consequent active transport by the FcRn
       receptor of the FcRn binding partner. Thus, the term Fc includes any variants of IgG Fc
       that are functional. The region of the Fc portion of IgG that binds to the FcRn receptor
       has been described based on X-ray crystallography (Burmeister et al. 1994, Nature
       372:379, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The major contact area of the
       Fc with the FcRn is near the junction of the CH2 and CH3 domains. Fc-FcRn contacts are
       all within a single Ig heavy chain. The FcRn binding partners include, e.g., whole IgG,
       the Fc fragment of IgG, and other fragments of IgG that include the complete binding
       region of FcRn. The major contact sites include amino acid residues 248, 250-257, 272,
       285, 288, 290-291, 308-311, and 314 of the CH2 domain and amino acid residues 385
       387, 428, and 433-436 of the CH3 domain. References made to amino acid numbering of

       Exp. Med. 180: 2377), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.)       An Fc may
       comprise the CH2 and CH3 domains of an immunoglobulin with or without the hinge
       region of the immunoglobulin. Exemplary Fc variants are provided in WO 2004/101740

[00731         Fc (or Fc portion of a chimeric polypeptide) may also include, e.g., the following
       mutations: The Fe region of IgG can be modified according to well recognized
       procedures such as site directed mutagenesis and the like to yield modified IgG or Fc
       fragments or portions thereof that will be bound by FcRn. Such modifications include,
       e.g., modifications remote from the FcRn contact sites as well as modifications within the
       contact sites that preserve or even enhance binding to the FcRn. For example the
       following single amino acid residues in human IgGI FEc (FEcyl) can be substituted without
       significant loss of Fe binding affinity for FcRn: P238A, S239A, K246A, K248A, D249A,

E430A, N434A, T437A, Q438A, K439A, S440A, S444A, and K447A, where for
example P238A represents wildtype proline substituted by alanine at position number
238. In addition to alanine other amino acids may be substituted for the wildtype amino
acids at the positions specified above. Mutations may be introduced singly into Fc giving
rise to more than one hundred FcRn binding partners distinct from native Fc.
Additionally, combinations of two, three, or more of these individual mutations may be
introduced together, giving rise to hundreds more FcRn binding partners. Certain of these
mutations may confer new functionality upon the FcRn binding partner. For example, one
embodiment incorporates N297A, removing a highly conserved N-glycosylation site. The
effect of this mutation is to reduce immunogenicity, thereby enhancing circulating half
life of the FcRn binding partner, and to render the FcRn binding partner incapable of
binding to FecyRI, FcyRIIA, FcyRIIB, and FcyRIIIA, without compromising affinity for
FcRn (Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847, which is incorporated herein by
reference   in its entirety; Friend et al.    1999, Transplantation    68:1632, which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; Shields et al. 1995, J. Biol. Chem.
276:6591, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Additionally, at least
three human Fc gamma receptors appear to recognize a binding site on IgG within the
lower hinge region, generally amino acids 234-237. Therefore, another example of new
functionality and potential decreased immunogenicity may arise from mutations of this
region, as for example by replacing amino acids 233-236 of human IgGI "ELLG"to the
corresponding sequence from IgG2 "PVA" (with one amino acid deletion). It has been
shown that FcyRI, FcyRII, and FeyRIII which mediate various effector functions will not
bind to IgG1 when such mutations have been introduced (Ward and Ghetie 1995,
Therapeutic Immunology 2:77, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety;
and Armour et al.1999, Eur. J. Immunol. 29:2613, which is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety). As a further example of new functionality arising from
mutations described above affinity for FcRn may be increased beyond that of wild type in

                                               - 18
       some instances. This increased affinity may reflect an increased "on" rate, a decreased
       "off' rate or both an increased "on" rate and a decreased "off" rate. Mutations believed to
       impart an increased affinity for FcRn include, e.g., T256A, T307A, E380A, and N434A
       (Shields et al. 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591, which is incorporated herein by reference
       in its entirety).
[00741          The FEc (or Fc portion of a chimeric polypeptide) may be at least 90% or 95%
       identical to the Fc amino acid sequence shown in Table 2 (amino acids 1439 to 1665 of
       SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 2333 to 2559 of SEQ ID NO:6; amino acids 741 to 967 of
       SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 746 to 972 of SEQ ID NO:10; amino acids 685 to 924 of SEQ
       ID NO: 12). The Fc (or Fe portion of a chimeric polypeptide) may be identical to the Fc
       amino acid sequence shown in Table 2 (amino acids 1439 to 1665 of SEQ ID NO:2;

[00751          "Hybrid" polypeptides and proteins, as used herein, means a combination of a
       chimeric polypeptide with a second polypeptide.        The chimeric polypeptide and the
       second polypeptide in a hybrid may be associated with each other via protein-protein
       interactions, such as charge-charge       or hydrophobic    interactions.    The chimeric
       polypeptide and the second polypeptide in a hybrid may be associated with each other via
       disulfide or other covalent bond(s). Hybrids are described in WO 2004/101740 and WO
       2006/074199, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. See also
       US Patent Nos. 7,404,956 and 7,348,004, each of which is incorporated herein by
       reference in its entirety.  The second polypeptide may be a second copy of the same
       chimeric polypeptide or it may be a non-identical chimeric polypeptide. See, e.g., Figure
       1, Example 1, and Table 2.       In preferred embodiments, the second polypeptide is a
       polypeptide comprising an Fec. In preferred embodiments, the chimeric polypeptide is a
       chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptide and the second polypeptide consists essentially of
       Fec, e.g, the hybrid polypeptide of Example 1, which is a rFVIIIFc recombinant fusion
       protein consisting of a single molecule of recombinant B-domain deleted human FVIII
       (BDD-rFVIII) fused to the dimeric Fc domain of the human IgG1, with no intervening
       linker sequence. This hybrid polypeptide is referred to herein as FVIIIFc monomeric Fc
       fusion protein, FVIIIFc monomer hybrid, monomeric FVIIIIFc hybrid, and FVIIIFc

                                                -19
       monomer-dimer.       See Example 1, Fig. 1, and Table 2A.         The Examples provide
       preclinical and clinical data for this hybrid polypeptide.
[00761         The second polypeptide in a hybrid may comprise or consist essentially of a
       sequence at least 90% or 95% identical to the amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(ii)
       without a signal sequence (amino acids 1 to 227 of SEQ ID NO:4) or at least 90% or 95%
       identical to the amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(ii) with a signal sequence (amino
       acids -20 to 227 of SEQ ID NO:4). The second polypeptide may comprise or consist
       essentially of a sequence identical to the amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(ii)
       without a signal sequence (amino acids 1 to 227 of SEQ ID NO:4) or identical to the
       amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(ii) with a signal sequence (amino acids -20 to
       227 of SEQ ID NO:4).
[0077]         Figure 1 is a schematic showing the structure of a B domain deleted factor VIII-Fc
       chimeric polypeptide, and its association with a second polypeptide that is an Fc
       polypeptide. To obtain this hybrid, the coding sequence of human recombinant B-domain
       deleted FVIII was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
       from human liver poly A RNA (Clontech) using FVIII-specific primers.            The FVIII
       sequence includes the native signal sequence for FVIII. The B-domain deletion was from
       serine 743 (S743; 2287 bp) to glutamine 1638 (Q1638; 4969 bp) for a total deletion of
       2682 bp. Then, the coding sequence for human recombinant Fc was obtained by RT-PCR
       from a human leukocyte cDNA library (Clontech) using Fc specific primers.          Primers
       were designed such that the B-domain deleted FVIII sequence was fused directly to the
       N-terminus of the Fc sequence with no intervening linker. The FVIIIFc DNA sequence
       was cloned into the mammalian dual expression vector pBUDCE4.1 (Invitrogen) under
       control of the CMV promoter. A second identical Fc sequence including the mouse Igk
       signal sequence was obtained by RT-PCR and cloned downstream of the second
       promoter, EF a, in the expression vector pBUDCE4. 1.
[00781         The rFVIIIFc expression vector was transfected into human embryonic kidney
       293 cells (HEK293H;        Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine     2000 transfection reagent
       (Invitrogen).    Stable clonal cell lines were generated by selection with Zeocin
       (Invitrogen).     One clonal cell line, 3C4-22 was used to generate          FVIIIFc for
       characterization in vivo. Recombinant FVIIIFc was produced and purified (McCue et al.
       2009) at Biogen Idec (Cambridge, MA). The transfection strategy described above was

                                                - 20
       expected to yield three products, i.e., monomeric rFVIIIFc hybrids, dimeric rFVIIIFc
       hybrids and dimeric Fc. However, there was essentially no dimeric rFVIIIFc detected in
       the conditioned medium from these cells. Rather, the conditioned medium contained Fc
       and monomeric rFVIIIFec. It is possible that the size of dimeric rFVIIIFc was too great
       and prevented efficient secretion from the cell.        This result was beneficial since it
       rendered the purification of the monomer less complicated than if all three proteins had
       been present. The material used in these studies had a specific activity of approximately
       9000 IU/mg.
[00791         "Dosing interval," as used herein, means the amount of time that elapses between
       multiple doses being administered to a subject. The comparison of dosing interval may
       be carried out in a single subject or in a population of subjects and then the average
       obtained in the population may be calculated.
[00801         The dosing interval when administering a chimeric Factor VIII polypeptide, e.g., a
       chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptide (a polypeptide comprising a Factor VIII or a hybrid)
       of the invention may be at least about one and one-half times longer than the dosing
       interval required for an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII
       portion, e.g., without the Fc portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII). The
       dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half to six times longer, one and one
       half to five times longer, one and one-half to four times longer, one and one-half to three
       times longer, or one and one-half to two times longer, than the dosing interval required
       for an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion, e.g.,
       without the Fc portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII). The dosing interval
       may be at least about one and one-half, two, two and one-half, three, three and one-half,
       four, four and one-half, five, five and one-half or six times longer than the dosing interval
       required for an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion,
       e.g., without the Fe portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII).. The dosing
       interval may be about every five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, or
       fourteen days or longer. The dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half to 5,
       one and one-half, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days or longer. For on-demand treatment, the dosing
       interval of said chimeric polypeptide or hybrid is about once every 24-36, 24-48, 24-72,

       58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 62, 64, or 65 IU/kg) and the dosing interval is once every 3-5, 3-6, 3-7,
       3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 or more days, or three times per week, or no more than three times per
       week. Preferably, the effective dose is 65 IU/kg and the dosing interval is once weekly,
       or once every 6-7 days.
100821          "Long-acting Factor VIII" is a Factor VIII having an increased half-life (also
       referred to herein as t1/2, tl/2 beta, elimination half-life and HL) over a reference Factor
       VIII. The increased half-life of a long-acting Factor VIII may be due to fusion to one or
       more non-Factor VIII polypeptides such as, e.g., Fe, XTEN or albumin. The increased
       half-life may be due to one or more modification, such as, e.g., pegylation. Exemplary
       long-acting Factor VIII polypeptides include, e.g., chimeric Factor VIII polypeptides
       comprising Fe, chimeric Factor VIII polypeptides comprising XTEN and chimeric Factor
       VIII polypeptides comprising albumin.         Additional exemplary long-acting Factor VIII
       polypeptides include, e.g., pegylated Factor VIII.
[00831          The "reference" polypeptide, in the case of a long-acting chimeric Factor VIII
       polypeptide, is a polypeptide consisting essentially of the Factor VIII portion of the
       chimeric polypeptide, e.g., the same Factor VIII portion without the Fc portion, without
       the XTEN portion, or without the albumin portion. Likewise, the reference polypeptide
       in the case of a modified Factor VIII is the same Factor VIII without the modification,
       e.g., a Factor VIII without the pegylation.
[00841          In some embodiments, the long-acting Factor VIII has one or more of the
       following properties when administered to a subject:
       a mean residence time (MRT) (activity) in said subject of about 14-41.3 hours;
       a clearance (CL) (activity) in said subject of about 1.22-5.19 mL/hour/kg or less;
       a tl/2beta (activity) in said subject of about 11-26.4 hours;
       an incremental recovery (K value) (activity; observed) in said subject of about 1.38-2.88
       IU/dL per IU/kg;
       a Vss (activity) in said subject of about 37.7-79.4 mL/kg; and

       of the polynucleotides of Table 1, e.g., those that encode fragments of the polypeptides of
       Table 2, such as the Factor VIII, Fe, signal sequence, 6His and other fragments of the
       polypeptides of Table 2.
[00901         "Prophylactic treatment," as used herein, means administering a Factor VIII
       polypeptide in multiple doses to a subject over a course of time to increase the level of
       Factor VIII activity in a subject's plasma. Preferably, the increased level is sufficient to
       decrease the incidence of spontaneous bleeding or to prevent bleeding, e.g., in the event
       of an unforeseen injury. Preferably, during prophylactic treatment, the plasma protein
       level in the subject does not fall below the baseline level for that subject, or below the
       level of Factor VIII that characterizes severe hemophilia (<1 IU/dl [1%]).
[0091]         Preferably, the prophylaxis regimen is "tailored" to the individual patient,
       preferably by determining PK data for each patient and administering Factor VIII of the
       invention at a dosing interval that maintains a trough level of 1-3% FVIII activity.
       Adjustments may be made when a subject experiences unacceptable bleeding episodes
       defined as >2 spontaneous bleeding episodes over a rolling two-month period. In this
       case, adjustment will target trough levels of 3-5%.       Preferably, prophylactic treatment
       results in prevention and control of bleeding, sustained control of bleeding, sustained
       protection from bleeding, and/or sustained benefit. Prophylaxis, e.g., sustained protection
       can be demonstrated by an increased AUC to last measured time point (AUC-LAST) and
       reduced clearance, resulting in increased terminal tl/2 compared to short acting FVIIL
       Preferably, prophylaxis is demonstrated by better Cmax, better Tmax, and/or greater
       mean residence time versus short-acting FVIII.         Preferably, prophylaxis results in no
       spontaneous bleeding episodes within about 24, 36, 48, 72, or 96 hours (e.g., 25, 26, 27,

[00921          "Subject," as used herein means a human or a non-human mammal. Non-human
       mammals include, e.g., mice, dogs, primates, monkeys, cats, horses, cows, pigs, and other
       domestic animals and small animals.
[00931          "Therapeutic dose," as used herein, means a dose that achieves a therapeutic goal,
       as described herein. The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based upon
       the empirical finding that, on average, 1 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight raises the
       plasma factor VIII activity by approximately 2 IU/dL. The required dosage is determined
       using the following formula:
       Required units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (IU/dL or % of normal) x 0.5
       (IU/kg per IU/dL)
[00941          The therapeutic doses that may be used in the methods of the invention are about
        10-100 IU/kg, more specifically, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90,
       or 90-100 IU/kg, and more specifically, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70,

[00951          Additional therapeutic doses that may be used in the methods of the invention are
       about 10 to about 150 IU/kg, more specifically, about 100-110, 110-120, 120-130, 130
        140, 140-150 IU/kg, and more specifically, about 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145,
       or 150 U/kg.
[0096]          "Variant," as used herein, refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide differing from
       the original polynucleotide or polypeptide, but retaining essential properties thereof, e.g.,
       factor VIII coagulant activity or Fc (FcRn binding) activity.        Generally, variants are
       overall closely similar, and, in many regions, identical to the original polynucleotide or
       polypeptide. Variants include, e.g., polypeptide and polynucleotide fragments, deletions,
       insertions, and modified versions of original polypeptides.
[0097]          Variant polynucleotides may comprise, or alternatively consist of, a nucleotide
       sequence which is at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to, for
       example, the nucleotide coding sequence in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 (the factor
       VIII portion, the FEc portion, individually or together) or the complementary strand
       thereto, the nucleotide coding sequence of known mutant and recombinant factor VIII or
       Fc such as those disclosed in the publications and patents cited herein or the
       complementary strand thereto, a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide of SEQ ID

        NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 (the factor VIII portion, the Fc portion, individually or together),
        and/or polynucleotide fragments of any of these nucleic acid molecules (e.g., those
        fragments described herein).      Polynucleotides which hybridize to these nucleic acid
        molecules under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency conditions are also
        included as variants, as are polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides as long as they
        are functional.
[00981           Variant polypeptides may comprise, or alternatively consist of, an amino acid
        sequence which is at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% identical to, for
        example, the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 (the factor
        VIII portion, the Fc portion, individually or together), and/or polypeptide fragments of
        any of these polypeptides (e.g., those fragments described herein).
[00991           By a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence at least, for example, 95%
        "identical" to a reference nucleotide sequence, it is intended that the nucleotide sequence
        of the nucleic acid is identical to the reference sequence except that the nucleotide
        sequence may include up to five point mutations per each 100 nucleotides of the reference
        nucleotide sequence.     In other words, to obtain a nucleic acid having a nucleotide
        sequence at least 95% identical to a reference nucleotide sequence, up to 5% of the
        nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another
        nucleotide, or a number of nucleotides up to 5% of the total nucleotides in the reference
        sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. The query sequence may be, for
        example, the entire sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3, the ORF (open reading frame),
        or any fragment specified as described herein.
[001001          As a practical matter, whether any particular nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide
        is at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a nucleotide sequence or
        polypeptide of the present invention can be determined conventionally using known
        computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between
        a query sequence (reference or original sequence) and a subject sequence, also referred to
        as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the FASTDB computer program
        based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. (Comp. App. Biosci. (1990) 6:237-245), which is
        herein incorporated by reference in its entirety In a sequence alignment the query and
        subject sequences are both DNA sequences.         An RNA sequence can be compared by
        converting U's to T's. The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity.

                                               - 27
        Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB alignment of DNA sequences to calculate
       percent identity are:       Matrix=Unitary,    k-tuple=4, Mismatch Penalty=l,       Joining
        Penalty=30, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff Score=l, Gap Penalty=5, Gap Size
        Penalty 0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject nucleotide sequence,
        whichever is shorter.
[00101]         If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of 5' or 3'
        deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction must be made to the
       results. This is because the FASTDB program does not account for 5' and 3' truncations
        of the subject sequence when calculating percent identity.         For subject sequences
       truncated at the 5' or 3' ends, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is
        corrected by calculating the number of bases of the query sequence that are 5' and 3' of
       the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned, as a percent of the total bases of the
        query sequence. Whether a nucleotide is matched/aligned is determined by results of the
       FASTDB sequence alignment.          This percentage is then subtracted from the percent
        identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to
        arrive at a final percent identity score.   This corrected score is what is used for the
       purposes of the present invention. Only bases outside the 5' and 3' bases of the subject
        sequence, as displayed by the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with
       the query sequence, are calculated for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent
        identity score.
[00102]         For example, a 90 base subject sequence is aligned to a 100 base query sequence
       to determine percent identity. The deletions occur at the 5' end of the subject sequence
        and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matched/alignment of the first 10
        bases at 5' end. The 10 unpaired bases represent 10% of the sequence (number of bases
        at the 5' and 3' ends not matched/total number of bases in the query sequence) so 10% is
        subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the
       remaining 90 bases were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In
        another example, a 90 base subject sequence is compared with a 100 base query
        sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so that there are no bases on the
        5' or 3' of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query. In this
        case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again,
        only bases 5' and 3' of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the

                                                - 28
        query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are to made for
        the purposes of the present invention.
[001031         By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least, for example, 95%
        "identical" to a query amino acid sequence of the present invention, it is intended that the
        amino acid sequence of the subject polypeptide is identical to the query sequence except
        that the subject polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per
        each 100 amino acids of the query amino acid sequence. In other words, to obtain a
        polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a query amino acid
        sequence, up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the subject sequence may be inserted,
        deleted, (indels) or substituted with another amino acid.        These alterations of the
        reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference
        amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either
        individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous
        groups within the reference sequence.
[001041         As a practical matter, whether any particular polypeptide is at least 85%, 90%,
        95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to, for instance, the amino acid sequences of SEQ
        ID NO:2 (the factor VIII portion, the Fc portion, individually or together) or 4, or a
        known factor VIII or FEc polypeptide sequence, can be determined conventionally using
        known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match
        between a query sequence (reference or original sequence) and a subject sequence, also
        referred to as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the FASTDB
        computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al., Comp. App. Biosci. 6:237
        245(1990), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In a sequence alignment the
        query and subject sequences are either both nucleotide sequences or both amino acid
        sequences. The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred
        parameters used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment are: Matrix=PAM 0, k-tuple=2,
        Mismatch Penalty=1, Joining Penalty=20, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff
        Score=l,    Window Size=sequence length, Gap Penalty=5, Gap Size Penalty=0.05,
        Window Size=500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence, whichever is shorter.
[001051         If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to N- or C-terminal
        deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction must be made to the
        results. This is because the FASTDB program does not account for N- and C-terminal

                                                - 29
        truncations of the subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject
        sequences truncated at the N- and C-termini, relative to the query sequence, the percent
        identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are
        N- and C-terminal of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned with a
        corresponding subject residue, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence.
        Whether a residue is matched/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence
        alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the
        above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent
        identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of the
        present invention. Only residues to the N- and C-termini of the subject sequence, which
        are not matched/aligned with the query sequence, are considered for the purposes of
        manually adjusting the percent identity score.      That is, only query residue positions
        outside the farthest N- and C-terminal residues of the subject sequence.
[001061          For example, a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100
        residue query sequence to determine percent identity.       The deletion occurs at the N
        terminus of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a
        matching/alignment of the first 10 residues at the N-terminus. The 10 unpaired residues
        represent 10% of the sequence (number of residues at the N- and C- termini not
        matched/total number of residues in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the
        percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 residues
        were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a
        90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time
        the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N- or C-termini of the
        subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query. In this case the percent
        identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected.          Once again, only residue
        positions outside the N- and C-terminal ends of the subject sequence, as displayed in the
        FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence are
        manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are to made for the purposes of the
        present invention.
[001071          The polynucleotide variants may contain alterations in the coding regions, non
        coding regions, or both.     Especially preferred are polynucleotide variants containing
        alterations which produce silent substitutions, additions, or deletions, but do not alter the

                                                - 30
        properties or activities of the encoded polypeptide.      Nucleotide variants produced by
        silent substitutions due to the degeneracy of the genetic code are preferred. Moreover,
        variants in which 5-10, 1-5, or 1-2 amino acids are substituted, deleted, or added in any
        combination are also preferred. Polynucleotide variants can be produced for a variety of
        reasons, e.g., to optimize codon expression for a particular host (change codons in the
        human mRNA to those preferred by a bacterial host such as E. coli).
1001081          Naturally occurring variants are called "allelic variants," and refer to one of
        several alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome of an
        organism (Genes II, Lewin, B., ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York (1985)). These allelic
        variants can vary at either the polynucleotide and/or polypeptide level and are included in
        the present invention. Alternatively, non-naturally occurring variants may be produced
        by mutagenesis techniques or by direct synthesis.
[001091          Using known methods of protein engineering and recombinant DNA technology,
        variants may be generated to improve or alter the characteristics of the polypeptides. For
        instance, one or more amino acids can be deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus of
        the secreted protein without substantial loss of biological function. The authors of Ron et
        al., J Biol. Chem. 268: 2984-2988 (1993), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety,
        reported variant KGF proteins having heparin binding activity even after deleting 3, 8, or
        27 amino-terminal amino acid residues. Similarly, Interferon gamma exhibited up to ten
        times higher activity after deleting 8-10 amino acid residues from the carboxy terminus of
        this protein. (Dobeli et al., J. Biotechnology 7:199-216 (1988), incorporated herein by
        reference in its entirety.)
[001101          Moreover, ample evidence demonstrates that variants often retain a biological
        activity similar to that of the naturally occurring protein. For example, Gayle and
        coworkers (J. Biol. Chem 268:22105-22111 (1993), incorporated herein by reference in
        its entirety) conducted extensive mutational analysis of human cytokine IL-l a. They used
        random mutagenesis to generate over 3,500 individual IL-la mutants that averaged 2.5
        amino acid changes per variant over the entire length of the molecule. Multiple mutations
        were examined at every possible amino acid position.          The investigators found that
         "[m]ost of the molecule could be altered with little effect on either [binding or biological
        activity]."   (See Abstract.) In fact, only 23 unique amino acid sequences, out of more

                                                 - 31
        than 3,500 nucleotide sequences examined, produced a protein that significantly differed
        in activity from wild-type.
[001111         As stated above, polypeptide variants include, e.g., modified polypeptides.
        Modifications include, e.g., acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent
        attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a
        nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative,
        covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond
        formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine,
        formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI
        anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation,
        pegylation (Mei et al., Blood 116:270-79 (2010), which is incorporated herein by
        reference    in  its  entirety), proteolytic processing,     phosphorylation,    prenylation,
        racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to
        proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination. In some embodiments, Factor VIII is
        modified, e.g., pegylated, at any convenient location. In some embodiments, Factor VIII
        is pegylated at a surface exposed amino acid of Factor VIII, preferably a surface exposed
        cysteine, which may be an engineered cysteine. Mei et al. (2010). In some embodiments,
        modified Factor VIII, e.g., pegylated Factor VIII, is a long-acting Factor VIII.
[001121          "Volume of distribution at steady state (Vss)," as used herein, has the same
        meaning as the term used in pharmacology, which is the apparent space (volume) into
        which a drug distributes. Vss = the amount of drug in the body divided by the plasma
        concentration at steady state.
[00113]          "About," as used herein for a range, modifies both ends of the range. Thus, "about
         10-20" means "about 10 to about 20."
[001141          Having now described the present invention in detail, the same will be more
        clearly understood by reference to the following examples, which are included herewith
        for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting of the invention. All

        Abstract
[00115]          A recombinant B-domain-deleted factor VIII-Fc (rFVIIIFc) fusion protein was
        created to extend the half-life of FVIII. rFVIIIFc was studied in mouse and dog models of
        severe hemophilia A and compared to rFVIII (ReFacto*). Whole blood clotting time
        (WBCT) in hemophilia A mice was corrected for approximately two to three times longer
        and the elimination half-life in plasma was nearly twice as long for rFVIIIFc compared to
        ReFacto@. In hemophilia A dogs, an intravenous dose of rFVIIIFc (125 IU/kg) corrected
        the WBCT to normal. The WBCT remained below 20 min, the time consistent with
        FVIII:C > 1%, through approximately 96 hr, compared to 48 hr for dogs treated with
        ReFacto*. The elimination half-life of rFVIIIFc in dog plasma, when measured using
        ELISA or chromogenic activity assays, was 15.7 ± 1.7 hr and 15.4 ± 0.3 hr, respectively.
        ReFacto* corrected WBCT for approximately one half as long as rFVIIIFc and the
        plasma half-life was 7.0 hr. Thus, fusion of FVIII to Fc produced a molecule with an
        increased plasma half-life and the ability to provide prolonged protection from bleeding.
        Introduction
[001161          Reduced mortality, prevention of joint damage and improved quality of life have
        been important achievements due to the development of plasma-derived and recombinant
        FVIII. Prolonged protection from bleeding would represent another key advancement in
        the treatment of hemophilia A patients. The inventors have created a recombinant factor
        VIII-Fc (rFVIIIFc) chimeric protein and hybrid as an approach to extend the half-life of
        FVIII.
[001171          rFVIIIFc is a heterodimeric hybrid protein comprised of B-domain-deleted FVIII
        fused recombinantly to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin GI (IgGi) (Fig. 1, SEQ
        ID NO:2; Table 2A) (This protein is also referred to herein as FVIIIFc monomeric Fc
        fusion protein, FVIIIFc monomer hybrid, monomeric FVIIIIFc hybrid, and FVIIIFc
        monomer-dimer.).     The Fc enables binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is
        responsible for protection of IgG from degradation and confers on IgG the three week
        half-life observed in humans (Ghetie V, and Ward ES., Annu. Rev. Immunol.
         2000;18:739-766; Roopenian DC, and Akilesh S., Nature Rev. Immunol. 2007;7:715
         725, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).

                                                - 33
[001181          The Fe domain of IgGI has been fused to growth factors, cytokines, enzymes and
        ligand-binding regions of receptors (Ashkanazi A, et al., Int. Rev. Immunol. 1993:10:219
        27; Chamow SM, and Ashkanazi A, Trends Biotechnol. 1996:14:52-60; Fisher et al., N.
        Engl. J. Med. 1996:334(26):1697-702, each of which is incorporated herein by reference
        in its entirety).   Several of these have become important therapeutic molecules (e.g.
        etanercept, alefacept, abatacept).   In these fusion proteins, two effector molecules are
        connected to two Fc molecules. In this example, rFVIIIFc has been constructed as a
        monomeric Fe fusion protein (one copy of a polypeptide consisting of the sequence in
        Table 2A(i) (SEQ ID NO:2) with or without the signal sequence and one copy of a
        polypeptide consisting of the sequence in Table 2A(ii) (SEQ ID NO:4) with or without
        the signal sequence), i.e., with only one copy of the effector molecule (see Figure 1), and
        the studies presented herein compare the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of this
        novel protein to rFVIII in mouse and dog models of hemophilia A. The signal sequence
        is cleavage during secretion.     This protein construct is referred to herein as FVIIIFc
        monomeric Fe fusion protein, FVIIIFc monomer hybrid, monomeric FVIIIIFc hybrid, and
        FVIIIFc monomer-dimer.         See Example 1, Fig. 1, Table 2A; and US Patent Nos.
        7,404,956 and 7,348,004, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety,
        for the structure and production of this protein.
        Methods and Materials
        FVIII Preparations
                 Recombinant FVIIIFc
[001191          The coding sequence of human recombinant B-domain deleted FVIII was
        obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from human liver
        poly A RNA (Clontech) using FVIII-specific primers. The FVIII sequence includes the
        native signal sequence for FVIII. The B-domain deletion was from serine 743 (S743;
        2287 bp) to glutamine 1638 (Q1638; 4969 bp) for a total deletion of 2682 bp See
        Example 1, Fig. 1, Table 2A; and US Patent Nos. 7,404,956 and 7,348,004, each of which
        is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, for the structure and production of this
        protein.
[001201          The coding sequence for human recombinant Fc was obtained by RT-PCR from a
        human leukocyte cDNA library (Clontech) using Fc specific primers.             Primers were

                                               - 34
        designed such that the B-domain deleted FVIII sequence was fused directly to the N
        terminus of the Fc sequence with no intervening linker. The FVIIIFc DNA sequence was
        cloned into the mammalian dual expression vector pBUDCE4.1 (Invitrogen) under
        control of the CMV promoter. A second identical Fc sequence including the mouse Igk
        signal sequence was obtained by RT-PCR and cloned downstream of the second
                       1 in the expression vector pBUDCE4. 1.
        promoter, EF lc,
[001211          The rFVIIIFc expression vector was transfected into human embryonic kidney
        293 cells (HEK293H; Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent
        (Invitrogen).    Stable clonal cell lines were generated by selection with Zeocin
        (Invitrogen).    One clonal cell line, 3C4-22 was used to generate FVIIIFc for
        characterization in vivo. Recombinant FVIIIFc was produced and purified (McCue JT, et
        al., J. Chromatogr. A 2009;7824-7830, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) at
        Biogen Idec (Cambridge, MA). The transfection strategy described above was expected
        to yield three products, i.e., monomeric rFVIIIFc hybrid, dimeric rFVIIIFc hybrid and
        dimeric Fc.     However, there was essentially no dimeric rFVIIIFc detected in the
        conditioned medium from these cells. Rather, the conditioned medium contained FEc and
        monomeric rFVIIIFec. It is possible that the size of dimeric rFVIIIFc was too great and
        prevented efficient secretion from the cell. This result was beneficial since it rendered the
        purification of the monomer less complicated than if all three proteins had been present.
        The material used in these studies had a specific activity of approximately 9000 IU/mg.
        In addition, these human cells produced higher protein level than other cells that were
        attempted in this experiment.
        Recombinant FV1II
[00122]          Recombinant B-domain deleted FVIII (ReFacto *) was purchased from Novis
        Pharmaceuticals and was prepared according to manufacturer's instructions. ReFacto"
        (recombinant B-domain deleted FVIII) has the same amino acid sequence as amino acids
        I to 1438 of SEQ ID NO:2.
        Hemophilia A animals
1001231          The hemophilia A mice are FVIII exon 16 knockouts on a 129 x B6 background
        that were obtained from Dr. Kazazian at the University of Pennsylvania (Bi L, et al., Nat.
        Genet. 1995; 10(1): 119-121, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) and bred at

                                                - 35
        Syntonix. These mice exhibit prolonged whole blood clotting times (>60 min), and are
        thus a good model of severe hemophilia A.
[001241         Hemophilia A dogs were from the in-bred colony maintained at the Francis Owen
        Blood Research Laboratory at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (Graham, JB,
        et al., J. Exp. Med. 1949;90:97-11 1, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).
        These dogs have a severe hemophilic phenotype comparable to the severe form of the
        human disease (Graham, JB, et al., J. Exp. Med. 1949;90:97-111; Lozier, JN, et al., Proc.
        Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002;99:12991-12996, each of which is incorporated by reference herein
        in its entirety).
        Study Designs
                 Hemophilia A Mouse Studies
{001251          The effect of rFVIIIFc and ReFacto* on whole blood clotting time (WBCT) was
        studied in FVIII-deficient mice. Each protein was administered intravenously at 50 IU/kg
        and blood was collected from the tail vein of each mouse pre-dose and various time
        points post-dosing. The blood samples were incubated in microtubes at 37'C and visually
         inspected once per minute for the presence of a clot.        Time of clot formation was
        recorded. If no clot formed by 60 min, the clotting time was recorded as >60min. Blood
         from normal mice clots in approximately 4 min (range 2-7 min, n       =  10 mice) in the
         WBCT assay.
[001261          In a second set of studies, hemophilia A mice were administered a single
         intravenous dose of 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc, ReFacto" or Advate* (4 mice per time point).
         Blood was collected by cardiac puncture in one tenth volume 3.2% sodium citrate at 0.25,
         8, 24, 48 and 72 hr after dosing. Plasma was prepared and stored at -80'C until analysis
         for FVIII activity using a FVIII-specific chromogenic activity assay.
         Hemophilia A Dog Studies
 [001271         In a single dose PK/PD study of rFVIIIFc, two hemophilia A dogs from the
         Chapel Hill colony were administered a single intravenous dose of 125 IU/kg and blood
         samples were collected pre-dose and after dosing at selected time points for WBCT,
         activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), FVIIIFc plasma concentration, hematology
         and serum chemistry. Time points for WBCT included pre-dose, 5 and 30 min and 1, 2,

                                                - 36
        4, 8, 24, 32, 48, 72, 96, 144, and 168 hr after dosing. Blood collections for clotting
        activity (aPTT) and FVIIIFc plasma concentration included the time points listed above
        for WBCT as well as 15 min and 3, 6, 12 hours after dosing.
[00128]          A second study was conducted in which ReFacto" (114 IU/kg for dog M12 and
        120 IU/kg for dog M38) was administered intravenously. WBCT was measured until
        clotting times were > 20 min (consistent with FVIII:C > 1%), and then 125 IU/kg
        rFVIIIFc was administered intravenously to the same dogs and blood samples were
        collected for WBCT, aPTT, FVIIIFc plasma concentration, hematology and serum
        chemistry. Time points for WBCT included pre-dose, 5 and 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 32,
        48, 72 hr after dosing. Blood was also collected at 96, 120, 144, and 168 hr after dosing
        with FVIIIFc. Blood collections for clotting activity and FVIIIFc plasma concentration
        included the time points listed above for WBCT as well as 15 min and 3, 6, 12 hours after
        dosing.
[001291          The WBCT procedure in hemophilia A dogs was slightly different than that in the
        hemophilia A mice. After dosing with rFVIIIFc or ReFacto*, one mL of blood was
        collected at various time points and 0.5 mL was distributed into two siliconized glass
        tubes which were subsequently placed into a 28'C water bath. Beginning at one minute,
        one tube was tilted every 30 sec, the second left undisturbed. When a clot formed in the
        tilted tube, the second tube was then tilted every 30 see until a clot formed. The time for
        a fully gelled clot in the second tube was recorded as the WBCT.
        FVIII activity in plasma
                 Measurement of FVIII activity in plasma by FVIII-specific chromogenic assay
[001301          Plasma samples were tested for FVIII activity by an automated chromogenic
        method using a Sysmex CA1500 instrument and reagents were from Siemans Healthcare
        Diagnostics (Dallas, TX, kit #B4238-40). Activity of rFVIIIFc was determined using a
        standard curve created using the 7th International Standard Factor FVIII Concentrate
        (NIBSC code 99/678) spiked into human FVIII-depleted plasma (Stago USA) at
        concentrations ranging from 1.5 - 0.016 IU/mL.

[001311         A FVIII antibody specific to the Al domain (Green Mountain Antibodies: GMA
         8002) was coated on 96 well plates and incubated for 1 hr at 37'C. The coated plates
        were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20, CaCl 2 and bovine serum
        albumin for 1 hr at room temperature and then standards, controls and samples that were
        prepared in normal dog plasma, were diluted 1:10 and then added to the plates and
        incubated for 1 hour at 37*C. The plates were washed and then donkey (F(ab)'2) anti
        human Fc-HRP (Jackson: 709-036-098) was added and incubated for 1 hr at 37*C. After
        washing, TMB (BioFx supersensitive substrate: TMBS-0100-01) was added to the plates,
        the substrate reaction was quenched with acid and absorbance was measured on a

[001321         An anti-FVIII antibody specific to the Al domain on the heavy chain (Green
        Mountain Antibodies: GMA-8002) was coated on 96 well plates and incubated for 2 hr at
        room temperature. The coated plates were blocked for 1 hr at 37 *C and after washing,
        the standards, controls and samples were prepared in normal dog plasma then diluted 1:10
        were added to the plates and incubated for 2 hr at room temperature. The plates were
        washed then treated with the detection antibody, a pre-diluted anti-FVIII horse radish
        peroxidase conjugate (Affinity Biologicals: F8C-EIA-D),       and incubated at room
        temperature for 1 hr. After washing TMB (BioFx supersensitive substrate: TMBS-0100
        01) was added to the plates for 10 min. The substrate reaction was quenched with acid
        and the signal was measured on a SpectraMax Plus plate reader (Molecular Devices) at a
        wavelength of 450 nm.
        Measurement of Fibrinogen
[001331         The concentration of fibrinogen in plasma was measured at Esoterix (Research
        Triangle Park, NC) using a kit that contains HemosILTM PT-Fibrinogen-HS reagent
        (Instrumentation Laboratory, Lexington, MA, Catalog #0008468210) and an ACL 7000
        Coagulation Analyzer (Beckman Coulter), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

[00134]         Platelets were counted in EDTA anti-coagulated whole blood by automated
        methods using the Vet-ABC-Diff Hematology Analyzer programmed with a species
        specific smart card (SCIL Animal Care Co., Gurnee, IL).
        Pharmacokinetic Analysis
[001351         The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis
        using WinNonlin software from Pharsight, version 5.2 (Mountain View, Ca).                PK
        parameters included the maximum concentration in plasma (Cmax), area under the plasma
        concentration versus time curve (AUC), elimination half-life (t1/ 2), volume of distribution
        (Vss), and clearance (Cl).
        Results
                Recombinant FVIII-Fc
[001361         rFVIIIFc is a recombinant fusion of human B-domain deleted FVIII with Fc from
        human IgGI, with no intervening linker sequence (rFVIIIFc; Figure 1).
[001371         Purified rFVIIIFc had a specific activity of approximately 9000 IU/mg as
        determined using a chromogenic activity assay. Recombinant B-domain deleted FVIII
        (ReFactoR) has a reported specific activity of 9110 - 13700 IU/mg.           Conversion of
        specific activity into IU/nmol to take into account the size difference between FVIIIFc
        and ReFacto* (216 kDa and 170 kDa respectively), indicates that the two proteins have
        approximately equivalent specific activities (1970 IU/nmol for rFVIIIFc and 1521 - 2287
        IU/nmol for ReFacto"). Thus the FVIII activity of rFVIIIFc is not affected by fusion of
        the C-terminus of human FVIII to the N-terminus of human Fc.
        Administration to Hemophilia A mice
[00138]         A single 50 IU/kg dose of rFVIIIFc or ReFacto* was administered intravenously
        to FVIII-deficient mice (n  = 6/group). Blood samples were collected pre-dose and after
        dosing through 120 hr and WBCT determined as described in Materials and Methods.
        Baseline WBCT were greater than 60 min. Data from a representative experiment are
        shown in Figure 2 and Table 3.        Immediately after dosing with either rFVIIIFc or
        ReFacto*, WBCT was corrected to 2-17 minutes.           Blood from mice treated with

                                                   - 39
        ReFacto* lost the ability to clot by 42 hr, whereas blood from all mice treated with
        rFVIIIFc still clotted at 96 hr, the blood from one of six was clotted at 113 hr, but all had
        lost the ability to clot by 120 hr. These data suggest that the duration of effect for
        rFVIIIFc is approximately two to three times longer than for ReFacto*.
[001391          The chromogenic activity of rFVIIIFc, ReFacto*k or Advate" (full-length
        recombinant FVIII) was studied in the FVIII-deficient mice after a single intravenous
        dose of 50 IU/kg. Blood was collected pre-dose and after dosing at 8, 24, 48, and 72 hr.
        The activity was measured using a FVIII-specific chromogenic activity assay and is
        shown in Figure 3. The pharmacokinetic parameters are reported in Table 4.                 The
        circulating half-life for rFVIIIFc was approximately 1.6 to 2 fold longer (11.1 hr)
        compared to Advate* (7 hr) and ReFacto* (5 hr). The Cmax was 1.6 ± 0.36 IU/mL for
        rFVIIIFc compared to 0.47 ± 0.30 IU/mL for Advate* and 0.67 ± 0.44 IU/mL for
        ReFacto* . The systemic exposure of rFVIIIFc was markedly greater for rFVIIIFc (22.6
        hr-IU/mL) compared to ReFacto* (6.94 hr-IU/mL) and Advate* (3.90 hr-IU/mL) and
        clearance for rFIIIFc was notably lower (2.09 mL/hr/kg) compared to both ReFacto* (7.2
        mL/hr/kg) and Advate' (12.8 hr/mL/kg) in the hemophilia A mice.
        Administration to Hemophilia A dogs
[001401          The pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of rFVIIIFc were
         studied in the Chapel Hill colony of hemophilia A dogs. A single intravenous dose of
         125 IU/kg rFVIIIFc was administered to each of four hemophilia A dogs and the WBCT
         was immediately corrected to normal (Figure 4). The range of WBCT in normal dogs is
         8-12 min. The WBCT remained below 20 min, the time consistent with FVIII:C >1%,
         through approximately 96 hr with the exception of one dog that had WBCT <20 min
         through 72 hr. In addition, aPTT was also immediately corrected to normal (Table 6).
         The concentration of rFVIIIFc in plasma was measured using a specific ELISA which
         was designed to detect both the FVIII and Fc portions of the molecule. The plasma
         concentration versus time curves are shown in Figure 5. PK analysis of the data showed
         that the t1 /2 was 15.7 ± 1.7 hr (Table 5). Similar results were obtained when rFVIIIFc was
         measured using a FVIII-specific chromogenic activity assay (t1 /2    = 15.4 ± 0.3 hr, Table 5)
         and the plasma concentration versus time curves were similar using both methods
         (Figures 5 and 6). When the activity data were converted from IU/mL to ng/mL using the

                                                  - 40
        specific activity for rFVIIIFc, there was a good correlation with the ELISA data, thereby
        demonstrating that the protein that was measured by ELISA was fully active.
[00141]          Two of the dogs treated with rFVIIIFc also received a single dose of ReFacto*,
         114 IU/kg for dog M12 and 120 IU/kg for dog M38, 72 hr prior to dosing with rFVIIIFc.
        WBCT and aPTT were corrected to normal immediately after dosing with ReFacto".
        However,     the    WBCT normalization         after the single   dose  of rFVIIIFc   lasted
        approximately twice as long compared to ReFacto*' (Figure 4). Moreover, the plasma
        half-life of rFVIIIFc (15.7         1.7 hr) was approximately twice as long for rFVIIIFc
        compared to ReFacto* (7.0 and 6.7 hr) when the concentration of the proteins in plasma
        were measured by ELISA (Table 5).              Similar results were obtained when the two
        molecules were measured by FVIII-specific chromogenic activity.
[001421          To assess the potential risk of thrombogenicity, platelets and fibrinogen were
        measured. After dosing with either rFVIIIFc or ReFacto*, platelet numbers and plasma
        fibrinogen concentration did not change from pre-dose values (data not shown).
        Discussion
[00143]          Recombinant FVIIIFc was produced in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293)
        cells from a stably transfected cell line and was purified from cell culture medium.
        Production in a human cell line represents a significant change in manufacturing
         compared to currently marketed rFVIII products which are produced in either Chinese
         Hamster Ovary cells or Baby Hamster Kidney cells. The rationale for this change was
        that it was expected that the human cells were best equipped to perform the necessary
         post-translational modifications for the FVIII portion of this molecule.
[001.44]         Conversion of the specific activity to IU/nmol to take into account the difference
         in molecular weights for rFVIIIFc and recombinant B-domain deleted FVIII (ReFacto")
         indicated that the specific activities are similar for both proteins (1970 IU/nmol for
         rFVIIIFc and 1521 - 2287 IU/nmol for ReFacto* ). It is somewhat surprising that the
         specific activity for rFVIIIFc is not affected by fusion of the C terminus of FVIII with the
         N-terminus of Fe since the Cl and C2 domain of FVIII are involved in phospholipid
         binding which is essential for full FVIII activity (Fay, PJ, J. Hematology 83:103-8 (2006)
         and Raut, S, et al., Br. J. Haematol. 107:323 (1999), each of which is incorporated by
         reference herein in its entirety).

                                                - 41
[00145]          Treatment of hemophilia A is on-demand at the time of a bleeding episode or by
        prophylaxis for the prevention of bleeding. Although on-demand treatment is still
        frequently used, there is a trend toward prophylaxis and the prevention of joint damage
        (Blanchette P, et al., Haemophilia 2004: 10;679-683, Manco-Johnson, MJ, et al., N. Engl.
        J. Med. 2007;357:535-544, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its
        entirety).    Current FVIII products are administered every two to three days for
        prophylaxis due to the relatively short half-life of 10-12 hr in order to maintain a FVIII:C
        above 1 % in patients (Morfini, M, Haemophilia 2003;9 (suppl 1):94-99;discussion 100,
        White GC, et al., Thromb. Haemost. 1997:77:660-7, Blanchette, P, et al., J. Thromb.
        Haemost. 2008 Aug;6(8):1319-26, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its
        entirety). Longer-acting FVIII therapies that provide prolonged protection from bleeding
        would represent a marked improvement in the quality of life for patients with hemophilia
        A.    Strategies to extend the half-life of clotting factors include those that have been
        successful for other molecules, including pegylation (Rostin J, et al., Bioconj. Chem.
        2000;11:387-96, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety), glycopegylation
        (Stennicke HR, et al., Thromb. Haemost. 2008;100:920-8, incorporated by reference
        herein in its entirety), formulation with pegylated liposomes (Spira J, et al., Blood
        2006;108:3668-3673, Pan J, et al., Blood 2009;114:2802-2811, each of which is
        incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) and conjugation with albumin (Schulte S.,
        Thromb. Res. 2008;122 SLppl 4:S14-9, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).
        Pegylation represents an approach to reduce clearance, however, the effect of the
        modification in vivo is currently unknown. The outcome of direct pegylation of FVIII on
        in vivo is currently unknown, whereas FVIII formulated with pegylated liposomes has
        been studied clinically and showed a modest to no effect on bleeding periods (Spira J, et
        al., Blood 2006;108:3668-3673, Spira J, et al., Thromb. Haemost. 2008 Sep;100(3):429
         34, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).
[001461          The present approach to extend the half-life of FVIII was to recombinantly fuse
        FVIII to the Fc domain of IgGl. FEc binds to the naturally occurring receptor, FcRn, of
        which the normal function is protection of IgG from degradation. The results described
        herein represent the initial pharmacokinetic and efficacy characterization of rFVIIIFc
         compared to a rFVIII product in hemophilia A mice and hemophilia A dogs. In both
         species, the half-life of rFVIIIFc was approximately twice that of rFVIII when measured

                                                  - 42
        by FVIII activity or ELISA (dogs only). These data also correlated well with the WBCT
        results from both animal models, i.e. the duration of the effect of rFVIIIFc on WBCT was
        approximately twice as long compared to ReFacto*. In dogs, the Cmax and clearance were
        similar for rFVIIIFc and ReFacto*, but the AUC and volume of distribution at steady
        state were approximately 1.5 fold and 2 fold greater for rFVIIIFc compared to ReFacto,
        respectively. The PK parameters for ReFacto* in this animal model are consistent with
        the values reported in the literature (Brinkhous K, et al., Sem. Thromb. Haemost.
        2002;28:269-272, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).
[001471          If these findings translate to the same extension of half-life in humans, this could
        represent a significant advancement in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.

        Animals
[001621         Cynomolgus monkeys from the New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) colony were
        used, and the study (NIRC Study # 8733-0903) was conducted under an approved NIRC
        IACUC protocol (APS 2008-8733-058) at NIRC in New Iberia, LA.
[001631         Six naive cynomolgus monkeys (three males, three females) that were determined
        to be in good health were used in the study.
[001641         The study was performed in compliance with the protocol and UL Lafayette
        NIRC Standard Operating Procedures.
        Study Design
[001651         rFVIIIFc was administered intravenously at 125 IU/kg to each of six monkeys
        (three males, three females). Xyntha (BDD-rFVIII) was administered intravenously to
        the same animals at 125 IU/kg in a crossover design. Group 1 animals (n     = 3) received
        Xyntha on Day 0 and rFVIIIFc on Day 3, while Group 2 animals (n               3) received
        rFVIIIFc on Day 0 followed by Xyntha on Day 4. The additional day between doses for
        group 2 was to ensure that the rFVIIIFc had sufficient time to decrease below projected
        baseline levels. Blood was collected for plasma in one-tenth volume 3.2 % sodium citrate
        from each animal predose and after dosing at 0.25, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hr for
        measurement of rFVIIIFc or Xyntha by ELISA and a FVIII-specific chromogenic activity
         assay.

        ELISA to measure rFVIIIFc and FVIII in plasma
        Method to Measure rFVIIIFc in Monkey Plasma
[00166]         This Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) is designed to quantify
        rFVIIIFc in monkey plasma.         In this ELISA method, goat anti-human IgG-(H+L)
        antibody (monkey absorbed) from Bethyl Laboratories (Cat#A80-319A) is diluted in
        Coating Buffer and immobilized onto a 96-well microtiter sample plate. The plate is
        aspirated, and all un-adsorbed sites are blocked with the addition of Blocking Buffer (3%
        BSA/lxTris) for approximately 2 hours at 37'C. Plasma samples are diluted 1:20 with
        High Calcium Sample Dilution Buffer (30% Non-Fat Dry Milk/TBST with 30 mM CaCl2)
        and dispensed onto the sample plate. Plates are incubated for approximately 2 hours at
        37'C. The plate is subsequently washed and mouse anti-B domain-deleted (U.BDDA1)
        Factor VIII (Al domain) antibody from Green Mountain Antibodies (Cat#GMA-8002) is
        added to the plate and incubated for approximately 1 hour at 37'C. After washing the
        plate, HRP-conjugated      goat anti-mouse IgG2a antibody from Southern Biotech
        (Cat#1080-05) is added to the plate and incubated for approximately 30 minutes at room
        temperature.   The plate is washed again and a tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) peroxidase
        substrate solution is added and incubated for approximately 30 minutes at room
        temperature. The reaction is stopped by addition of a non-acidic Stop Solution. Color
        develops in proportion to the amount of rFVIIIFc in the sample. Plates are read on an
        absorbance plate reader using a single detection wavelength, 650 nm.             rFVIIIFc
        concentrations are determined on a standard curve obtained by plotting optical density
        (OD) versus concentration using a four-parameter logistic curve-fitting program. The
        calibration curve range of this method is 0.400 ng/mL - 51.2 ng/mL in 5% monkey
        plasma (8.00 ng/mL - 1024 ng/mL in 100% monkey plasma). One calibrator outside the
        qualified range of the assay at 0.200 ng/mL in 5% monkey plasma may be included to
        serve as an anchor point to facilitate curve-fitting. The anchor point is removed or
        retained based on the best fit of the curve (i.e., the highest number of standards read
        within defined accuracy, %RE).
        Method to Measure FVIII in Monkey Plasma
[001671         This Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) is designed to quantify
        FVIII in monkey plasma. In this ELISA method, mouse aBDDAl FVIII antibody from

        Green Mountain Antibodies (Cat# GMA-8002)            is diluted in Coating Buffer and
        immobilized onto a 96-well microtiter sample plate. The plate is aspirated, and all un
        adsorbed sites are blocked with the addition of Blocking Buffer (3% BST/1xTris) for
        approximately 1 hour at 370 C.       Plasma samples are diluted 1:20 with High Calcium
        Sample Dilution Buffer (Blocking Buffer with 100 mM CaCl2) and dispensed onto the
        sample plate. Plates are incubated for approximately 2 hours at 37'C. After washing the
        plate, a Detecting Antibody from the Affinity Biologicals Kit, an HRP labeled polyclonal
        antibody (Cat#F8C-EIA-D), is further diluted in TBS/0.05% Tween 20, and added to the
        plate and incubated for approximately 1 hour at room temperature. The plate is washed
        again and a tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) peroxidase substrate solution is added and
        incubated for approximately 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction is stopped by
        addition acidic Stop Solution. Color develops in proportion to the amount of FVIIIFc in
        the sample.     Plates are read on an absorbance plate reader using a single detection
        wavelength, 450 nm. FVIII concentrations are determined on a standard curve obtained
        by plotting optical density (OD) versus concentration using a four-parameter logistic
        curve-fitting program. The calibration curve range of this method is 0.625 ng/mL - 20
        ng/mL in 5% monkey plasma (12.5 ng/mL - 400 ng/mL in 100% monkey plasma). Two
        calibrators outside the qualified range of the assay at 0.313 and 0.156 ng/mL in 5%
        monkey plasma may be included to serve as anchor points to facilitate curve-fitting. The
        anchor points can be removed or retained based on the best fit of the curve (i.e., the
        highest number of standards read within defined accuracy, %RE).
        FVIII-Specific Chromogenic Assay
[001681          FVIII activity in cynomolgus monkey plasma samples was estimated based on
        administered dose, and then diluted to approximately 0.25 - I IU/ml in human FVIII
        depleted plasma (Diagnostica Stago).        Samples were analyzed in a Sysmex CA1500
        (Siemens Diagnostic Healthcare) using a FVIII chromogenic kit (Siemens).           In this
        chromogenic assay, rFVIIIFc in the plasma samples is activated by thrombin. Activated
        Factor VIII (FVIIIa) then accelerates the conversion of Factor X (FX) to Factor Xa (FXa)
        in the presence of activated Factor IX (FIXa), phospholipids (PL) and calcium ions. The
        FXa activity is assessed by hydrolysis of a p-nitroanilide substrate specific to FXa. The
        initial rate of release of p-nitroaniline (pNA) measured at 405 nm is proportional to the
        FXa activity, and thus to the FVIII activity in the sample. The limit of quantitation of

                                                - 46
        FVIII activity due to rFVIIIFc in this assay is ~ 0.3 IU/ml. The assay can measure total
        FVIII activity down to a lower limit of approximately 0.06 IU/ml with an accuracy of ±
        20%.      The calculated activity of the pre-dose sample for individual animals was
        subtracted from the value at each time point to generate the PD curves (FVIII activity vs.
        time).
[001691          A standard curve was generated from the NIBSC 7th International Standard FVIII
        concentrate diluted to 1 1U/ml in human FVIII-deficient plasma. Standard curves were
        diluted serially in the Sysmex instrument to yield concentrations of 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025,
        0.0053 and 0.0026 IU/ml. Since the instrument dilutes all samples 1:10 internally, the
        FVIII standard concentrations correspond to plasma concentrations of 1.5 - 0.026 IU/ml,
        which is the range of FVIII activities that can be measured.
        PK analysis
[001701          The concentration time profiles were evaluated using the non-compartmental
        analysis module in the WinNonlin software program (Version 5.2, Pharsight Corporation,
        Mountain View, CA).
        RESULTS
[00171]          The concentration of rFVIIIFc in monkey plasma was measured using a sandwich
        ELISA format that measured both the FVIII and Fc portions of the molecule and the data
        are reported in Table 7. All predose samples were below the limit of quantitation. Figure
        7 illustrates the group mean rFVIIIFc and Xyntha plasma concentrations over time and
        individual plasma concentration versus time curves are shown in Figure 8. A summary of
        the PK parameters for rFVIIIFc and Xyntha are shown in Tables 9 and 10, respectively.
        The mean t1/2 for rFVIIIFc was 11.9 ± 1.7 hr (range 9.3 to 14.1 hr) and for Xyntha, the
        mean elimination tl/2 was 12.7 ± 4.4 hr (range 9.2 to 19.9 hr).
[001721          FVIII activity was measured using a FVIII-specific chromogenic activity assay
        and the data are reported in Table 8. Pre-dose activity due to endogenous FVIII was
        subtracted from all samples. A graph of the mean group data is shown in Figure 9 and the
        individual plasma concentration vs. time curves are shown in Figure 10. A summary of
        the PK parameters are reported for rFVIIIFc and Xyntha in Tables 9 and 10, respectively.
        The mean elimination tl/2 was 16.1    + 6.9 hr (range 11.6 to 29.4 hr) for rFVIIIFc and 12.5
        ± 1.7 hr (range 10.4 to 14.3 hr) for Xyntha.

        Discussion and Conclusions
[001731           The elimination half-lives were similar for rFVIIIFc and Xyntha after a single
        intravenous dose of 125 IU/kg. whether the test article was measured by ELISA or a
        chromogenic activity assay.
                                               Example 3
[001741           This will be a Phase I/Ila, open-label, crossover, dose-escalation, multi-center, and
        first-in-human study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
        a single dose of rFVIIIFc in subjects with severe (defined as <1 IU/dL [1%] endogenous
        factor VIII [FVIII]) hemophilia A.          A total of approximately 12 previously treated
        patients will be enrolled and dosed with rFVIIIFc at 25 or 65 IU/kg. After the screening
        (scheduled within 28 days prior to the first dose of the Advate@ [rFVIII], the reference
        comparator agent) and a minimum of 4-days (96 hours) elapsing with no FVIII treatment
        prior to the first injection, approximately 6 subjects will receive a single 25 IU/kg dose of
        Advate@ followed by a 3-day (72 hours) pharmacokinetic (PK) profile then crossover and
        receive a 25 IU/kg single, open-label dose of rFVIIIFc for a 7-day (168 hours) PK
        profiling. The first 3 subjects will be dosed sequentially. For the first three (3) subjects
        dosed with 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc, each subject will undergo an inhibitor assessment at
         14-days (336 hours) post-injection of rFVIIIFc. Dosing of the next subject (for the first
        three subjects only) will occur once the inhibitor testing is completed.         After the 3rd
         subject completed the 14 day inhibitor assessment, the remaining three subjects at 25
         IU/kg and the six subjects at 65 IU/kg will begin enrollment sequentially at least 1 day
         apart within each dose group.
[001751           One week after the last subject receives the 25 IU/kg dose of the rFVIIIFc,
         approximately 6 unique subjects will be recruited for the 65 IU/kg cohort. Each subject
         in the 65 IU/kg cohort will receive a single 65 IU/kg dose of Advate@ followed by a 4
         day (96 hours) PK profiling then crossover and receive a 65 IU/kg single, open-label dose
         of rFVIIIFc for a 10-day (240 hours) profiling. If a bleeding episode occurs before the
         first injection of rFVIIIFc in any cohort, subject's pre-study FVIII product should be used
         for treatment and an interval of at least 4 days must then pass before receiving the first
         injection of rFVIIIFc for the PK profile.

[001761         All subjects will be followed for a 14-day (336 hours) and 28 day safety
        evaluation period after administration of rFVIIIFe 25 IU/kg or 65 IU/kg for safety.      All
        subjects will undergo pharmacokinetic sampling pre- and post-dosing along with blood
        samples for analysis of FVIII activity at designated time points.

        Activity within the Xase Complex
[001771         To investigate the binding of the FVIII proteins (rBDD FVIII and rFVIIIFc) with
        FIXa, and measure the ability of these proteins to activate FX, kinetic studies were
        performed examining these interactions in the context of the Xase complex. This assay
        involved the formation of the Xase complex with activated FIX and activated rBDD
        FVIII or rFVIIIFc protein on a phospholipid surface in the presence of calcium, and
        monitoring the conversion of FX to FXa as measured by cleavage of a chromogenic or
        fluorogenic substrate.
[001781         Briefly, FVIII is first activated with a-thrombin for 5 min, then mixed with FIXa
        in the presence of Ca2+, and synthetic phospholipid vesicles (25% phosphatidylserine
        (PS)/75% phosphatidylcholine (PC)) or platelets. Under conditions described below,
        FVIIIa and FIXa interact in the presence of a phospholipid surface and calcium ions to
        form an active Xase complex that mediates the conversion of FX into FXa through
        proteolytic processing. In turn, FXa cleaves a FXa-specific chromogenic or fluorogenic
        substrate. The cleaved substrate is chromogenic and therefore the amount of cleaved
        substrate in a solution is indicative of the amount of FXa generated. This is quantitated by
        measuring the absorbance of the solution at 405 nm.
        A. Activation of Factor X
[001791         The ability of rBDD FVIII and rFVIIIFc to activate FX were studied in the
        context of the Xase complex as described above. Thrombin-activated FVIII proteins were
        incubated with FIXa and phospholipids in the presence of calcium, then added to different
        concentrations of FX in the presence of a FX-specific substrate and the rates of FXa
        generation detennined (Figure 11).
[001801         Based on these data, the Km and Vmax for the different FVIII proteins in the
        context of the Xase complex were calculated (Chang 1997) (Table 11). Data are

                                                 - 49
         expressed as the mean of six analyses (3 experiments containing duplicate runs) ± the
        corresponding standard deviation. Based on these data, these proteins (rBDD FVIII and
        rFVIIIFc) were found to have comparable Km and Vmax values, within the variation of
        the assay. Therefore, the Xase complex formed with rFVIIIFc behaves similarly to the
        Xase complex formed with the licensed product rBDD FVIII (ReFacto) with respect to
        interactions with phospholipids and ability to activate FX. Note that these comparable
        data also demonstrate that rFVIIIFc is activated to a comparable degree as rBDD FVIII
        after a short incubation with thrombin.
        B. Interaction with FIXa
[001811         The interaction between rBDD FVIII and rFVIIIFc with FIXa were also examined
        in the context of the Xase complex. The Xase complex was assembled as above, using a
        fixed amount of FX and varying FIXa levels, and FXa generation rates determined
        (Figure 12). From these data, the Kd value for the Xase complex formed with both of the
        FVIII proteins to FIXa were determined (Chang 1997). Data are expressed as the mean of
        six analyses (3 experiments containing duplicate runs) ± the corresponding standard
        deviation (Table 12). Both proteins were found to have similar Kd and Vmax values,
        indicating that rFVIIIFc has comparable interactions with FIXa as the licensed rBDD
        FVIII product.
                                           Example 5
[001821         Interim pharmacokinetic data for the Phase I/Ila clinical trial discussed in
        Example 3 demonstrated the following results for FVIIIFc. FVIIIFc had about a 50%
        increase in systemic exposure (AUCINF), about 50% reduction in clearance (Cl), and
        about 50-70% increase in elimination half-life and MRT compared to ADVATE (full
        length rFVIII).    In addition, FVIIIFc showed increased C168, TBLP1, TBLP3, and
        TBLP5 values compared to ADVATE.

                                           Example 6
[001831          A recombinant B-domain-deleted factor VIII-Fc (rFVIIIFc) fusion protein has
        been created as an approach to extend the half-life of FVIII. The pharmacokinetics (PK)
        of rFVIIIFc were compared to rFVIII in hemophilia A mice. We found that the terminal
        half-life was twice as long for rFVIIIFc compared to rFVIII. In order to confirm that the
        underlying mechanism for the extension of half-life was due to the protection of rFVIIIFc
        by FcRn, the PK were evaluated in FcRn knockout and human FcRn transgenic mice. A
        single intravenous dose (125 IU/kg) was administered and the plasma concentration
        measured using a chromogenic activity assay. The Cmax was similar between rFVIIIFc
        and rFVIII (XYNTHA@) in both mouse strains. However, while the half-life for rFVIIIFc
        was comparable to that of rFVIII in the FcRn knockout mice, the half-life for rFVIIIFc
        was extended to approximately twice longer than that for rFVIII in the hFcRn transgenic
        mice. These results confirm that FcRn mediates or is responsible for the prolonged half
        life of rFVIIIFc compared to rFVIII.      Since hemostasis in whole blood measured by
        rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM) has been shown to correlate with the efficacy of
        coagulation factors in bleeding models of hemophilia mice as well as in clinical
        applications, we sought to evaluate the ex vivo efficacy of rFVIIIFc in the hemophilia A
        mice using ROTEM. Hemophilia A mice were administered a single intravenous dose of
        50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc, XYNTHA@ (FVIII) or ADVATE@ (FVIII). At 5 minutes post dose,
        clot formation was similar with respect to clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT)
        and a-angle. However, rFVIIIFc showed significantly improved CT at 72 and 96 hr post
        dose, and CFT and a-angle were also improved at 96 hrs compared to both XYNTHA@
        (FVIII) and ADVATE@ (FVIII), consistent with prolonged PK of rFVIIIFc. Therefore
        construction of an Fc fusion of FVIII produces a molecule with a defined mechanism of

                                                -51
        action that has an increased half-life and the potential to provide prolonged protection
        from bleeding.
                                            Example 7
[001841          This Example presents final analysis results for FVIII activity from 16 patients
        treated with 25 and 65 IU/kg FVIII products. See Examples 3 and 5.
[001851          In this Example, rFVIIIFc is a recombinant fusion protein comprised of a single
        molecule of recombinant B-domain deleted human FVIII (BDD-rFVIII) fused to the
        dimeric Fe domain of the human IgGI, with no intervening linker sequence. This protein
        construct is also referred to herein as rFVIIIFc heterodimeric hybrid protein, FVIIIFc
        monomeric Fc fusion protein, FVIIIFc monomer hybrid, monomeric FVIIIIFc hybrid, and
        FVIIIFc monomer-dimer. See Example 1, Fig. 1, and Table 2A.
[001861          Preclinical studies with rFVIIIFc        have shown an approximately        2-fold
        prolongation of the half-life of rFVIII activity compared to commercially available rFVIII
        products. The rationale for this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a
        single dose of rFVIIIFc in frozen liquid formulation and provide data on the PK in severe
        hemophilia A subjects.      For this study, 16 evaluable subjects were available for PK
        evaluation. Single administration of two doses of both rFVIIIFc and Advate at a nominal
        dose of 25 (n=6) and 65 IU/kg of body weight (n=10) were infused intravenously over
        approximately 10 minutes. Blood samples for plasma PK assessments were obtained
        before infusion, as well as up to 10 days after dosing. The PK of FVIII activity for both
        Advate and rFVIIIFc were characterized in this study using a model-dependent method.
         OBJECTIVES
[001871           The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of
         single administration of two doses of rFVIIIFc (25 and 65 IU/kg) in previously treated
         patients (PTPs) aged 12 and above with severe hemophilia A.
 [001881          The secondary objectives were to determine the pharmacokinetics             (PK)
         parameters determined by pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of FVIII over time after a
         single administration of 25 or 65 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc compared to Advate in one-stage
         clotting and chromogenic assays.

[00189]          Blood samples were collected for FVIII activity PK evaluations at the screening
        visit (within 28 days prior to dosing Advate); on Day 0 (injection of Advate) pre-injection
        and at 10 and 30 minutes and 1, 3, 6, and 9 hours post-injection; on Day 1 at 24 hours
        post-injection of Advate; on Day 2 at 48 hours post-injection of Advate; on Day 3 at 72
        hours post-injection of Advate; and on Day 4 at 96 hours post-injection of high dose of
        Advate (Cohort B only).
[001901          Blood samples were collected for FVIII activity PK evaluations on the day of
        rFVIIIFc injection just prior to the administration of rFVIIIFc, at 10 and 30 minutes and
         1, 3, 6, and 9 hours post-injection of rFVIIIFc; on Day 1 at 24 hours post-injection of
        rFVIIIFc; on Days 2 through 5 at 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours post-injection of rFVIIIFc; on
        Day 7 at 168 hours post-injection of rFVIIIFc; on Days 8, 9, and 10 at 192, 216, and 240
        hours post-injection of high dose of rFVIIIFc (Cohort B only). FVIII activity was also
        measured at the final study visit (28 days post-injection of rFVIIIFc) at 672 hours post
        injection of rFVIIIFc.

         AUCINF was slightly less than proportional to dose over the dose range evaluated.
[001.95]         After the end of the infusion, the decline of the observed FVIII activity exhibited
         monoexponential decay characteristics until the baseline level was reached. The rate of
         decline in FVIII activity was slower for rFVIIIFc than for Advate with mean (±SD)
         model-predicted elimination half-life values of 11.9 ± 2.98 and 10.4 ± 3.03 hr for Advate
         and 18.0 ± 3.88 and 18.4 ± 6.99 hr for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups,
         respectively. Elimination half-life values appeared to be dose-independent over the dose
         range evaluated for both FVIII products.
[001961          Total systemic FVIII exposure (assessed by AUClNF) was             48 % and 61%
         greater following rFVIIIFc administration than Advate at 25 and 65 IU/kg dose levels,
         respectively. Mean (±SD) model-predicted AUCINF values were 974 ± 259 and 1810 ±
         606 hr*IU/dL for Advate and 1440 ± 316 and 2910         1320 hr*IU/dL for rFVIIIFc for the
         25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively.
 [001971         Similar to elimination half-life, the MRT was prolonged for rFVIIIFc relative to
         Advate. Mean (±SD) model-predicted MRT values were 17.1 ± 4.29 and 14.9 ± 4.38 hr
         for Advate and 25.9 ± 5.60 and 26.5 ± 10.1 hr for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose
         groups, respectively. MRT values appeared to be dose-independent over the dose range
         evaluated for both FVIII products.

[001981         In addition, primary PK parameter values for CL and V were determined. CL
        values for rFVIIIFc only accounted for ~ 66% of those observed for Advate at equivalent
        doses.   Mean (±SD) model-predicted CL values were 2.70 ± 0.729 and 4.08 ± 1.69
        mL/hr/kg for Advate and 1.80 ± 0.409 and 2.69 ± 1.25 mL/hr/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25
        and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. V values were comparable between Advate and
        rFVIIIFc with mean (±SD) model-predicted V values of 43.9 ± 4.27 and 56.1 ± 13.4
        mL/kg for Advate and 45.3 ± 7.23 and 61.6 ± 10.6 mL/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65
        IU/kg dose groups, respectively. Slight increases in mean CL and V values were noted
        with increasing dose of Advate and rFVIIIFc; however, the increase in standard
        deviations at the 65 IU/kg dose coupled with limited dose levels confounded an
        assessment of the dose-dependency of these parameters. For example, the CV%
        geometric mean CL value for the rFVIIIFc treatment group increased from 23.0% (25
        IU/kg) to 48.6% (65 IU/kg).
[001991         In addition to the primary PK parameters, secondary PK parameters (e.g. K
        values, IVR, etc.) were determined to evaluate FVIII duration of effect. Evidence of PK
        difference was also observed with rFVIIIFc demonstrating increased TBLPland TBLP3
        values compared to Advate at equivalent doses.       IVR and K-values for Advate and
        rFVIIIFc appeared to be comparable. A slight increase in TBLPI and TBLP3 values
        were observed with increasing dose of Advate and rFVIIIFe. In contrast, slight decreases
        in mean IVR and K-values were noted with increasing dose of Advate and rFVIIIFc. As
        previously indicated, an assessment of the dose dependency of these parameters is
        confounded by limited dose levels.
1002001         Mean (±SD) observed TBLP1 were 2.88 ± 0.733 and 2.93 ± 0.848 IU/dL per
        IU/kg for Advate and 4.28 ± 0.873 and 5.16 ± 2.02 IU/dL per IU/kg for rFVIIIFc for the
        25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. Mean (±SD) observed TBLP3 were 2.06 ±
        0.527 and 2.26 ± 0.666 IU/dL per IU/kg for Advate and 3.09 ± 0.623 and 3.93 ± 1.59
        IU/dL per IU/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively.
[002011         Mean IVR and K-values calculated using observed Cmax values (subtracted with
        baseline and residual drug within the model) were generally greater than values
        determined using model-predicted Cmax values; consistent with slight underestimation of
        the observed peak activity using the one-compartment model. Mean (±SD) observed K
        values were 2.57 ± 0.198 and 2.13 ± 0.598 IU/dL per IU/kg for Advate and 2.46 ± 0.330

                                                 - 55
        and 1.85 ± 0.332 IU/dL per IU/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups,
        respectively. Mean (±SD) observed IVR values were 94.1         + 15.6 and 85.8 +  16.5 % for
        Advate and 89.5 ± 11.9 and 74.8      +  6.72 % for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose
        groups, respectively.
        Single-Dose Pharmacokinetics (Chromogenic Assay)
[002021          Observed FVIII activity increased sharply after the short IV infusion of either
        Advate or rFVIIIFc, with mean (±SD) model-predicted Cmax values of 70.2 ± 9.60 and
        157 ± 38.6 IU/dL for Advate and 70.3 ± 10.0 and 158 ± 34.7 IU/dL for rFVIIIFc for the
        25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively.
[00203]          All Advate- and rFVIIIFc-treated patients had dose-related increases in FVIII
        activity. The observed increase in both Cmax and AUCINF was slightly less than
        proportional to dose over the dose range evaluated.
[002041          After the end of the infusion, the decline of the observed FVIII activity exhibited
        monoexponential decay characteristics until the baseline level was reached. The rate of
        decline in FVIII activity was slower for rFVIIIFc than for Advate with mean (±SD)
        model-predicted elimination half-life values of 10.7 ± 1.98 and 10.3 ± 3.27 hr for Advate
        and 16.2 ± 2.92 and 19.0 ± 7.94 hr for rFVIIIFec for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups,
        respectively. Elimination half-life values appeared to be dose-independent over the dose
        range evaluated for both FVIII products.
[002051          Total systemic FVIII exposure (assessed by AUCINF) was ~ 53% and 84%
        greater following rFVIIIFc administration than Advate at 25 and 65 IU/kg dose levels,
        respectively. Mean (±SD) model-predicted AUCINF values were 1080           + 236 and 2320  +
        784 hr*IU/dL for Advate and 1650 ± 408 and 4280        + 1860 hr*IU/dL for rFVIIIFc for the
        25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively.
[002061          Similar to elimination half-life, the MRT was prolonged for rFVIIIFc relative to
        Advate. Mean (±SD) model-predicted MRT values were 15.3 ± 2.86 and 14.8 ± 4.72 hr
         for Advate and 23.4 ± 4.22 and 27.3 ± 11.4 hr for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose
         groups, respectively. MRT values appeared to be dose-independent over the dose range
         evaluated for both FVIII products.
1002071          In addition, primary PK parameter values for CL and V were determined. CL
         values for rFVIIIFc only accounted for ~ 58-66% of those observed for Advate at
         equivalent doses. Mean (±SD) model-predicted CL values were 2.39 ± 0.527 and 3.21 ±

        1.40 mL/hr/kg for Advate and 1.57 ± 0.349 and 1.86 ± 0.970 mL/hr/kg for rFVIIIFc for
        the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively.      V values were comparable between
        Advate and rFVIIIFc with mean (±SD) model-predicted V values of 35.8 ± 5.52 and 43.6
        ± 11.2 mL/kg for Advate and 35.9 ± 6.65 and 42.7 ± 8.91 mL/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25
        and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. Increases in mean CL and V values were noted
        with increasing dose of Advate and rFVIIIFc; however, the increase in standard
        deviations at 65 IU/kg coupled with limited dose levels confounded an assessment of the
        dose-dependency of these parameters.
[002081         In addition to the primary PK parameters, secondary PK parameters (e.g. K
        values, IVR, etc.) were determined to evaluate FVIII duration of effect. Evidence of PK
        difference was also observed with rFVIIIFc demonstrating increased TBLPland TBLP3
        values compared to Advate at equivalent doses.       IVR and K-values for Advate and
        rFVIIIFc appeared to be comparable.
[002091         A slight increase in TBLPI and TBLP3 values were observed with increasing
        dose of Advate and rFVIIIFc. In contrast, slight decreases in mean IVR and K-values
        were noted with increasing dose of Advate and rFVIIIFc. As previously indicated, an
        assessment of the dose dependency of these parameters is confounded by limited dose
        levels.
[002101          Mean (±SD) observed TBLP1 were 2.70 ± 0.511 and 3.09 ± 0.978 IU/dL per
         IU/kg for Advate and 4.06 ± 0.798 and 5.66 ± 2.38 IU/dL per IU/kg for rFVIIIFc for the
         25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. Mean (±SD) observed TBLP3 were 1.98 ±
         0.377 and 2.39 ± 0.718 IU/dL per IU/kg for Advate and 3.04 ± 0.598 and 4.44 ± 1.84
         IU/dL per IU/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively.
 [002111         Mean IVR and K-values calculated using observed Cmax values (subtracted with
         baseline and residual drug within the model) were generally greater than values

         and 2.92 ± 0.985 IU/dL per IU/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups,
         respectively. Mean (±SD) observed IVR values were 112 ± 14.5 and 116 ± 26.9 % for
         Advate and 113 ± 16.3 and 117 ± 33.6 % for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose

        CONCLUSIONS
[002121         All Advate- and rFVIIIFc-treated patients had comparable dose-related increases
        in Cmax and AUCINF over the dose range evaluated. Peak plasma levels of Advate and
        rFVIIIFc activity were generally observed within the first hour after the end of the
        infusion and remained detectable for several days after dosing. After the end of infusion,
        the decline in baseline corrected FVIII activity exhibited monoexponential decay until the
        baseline was reached for both products. Parameter values for elimination half-life and
        MRT appeared to be dose-independent over the dose range evaluated for both FVIII
        products. Slight increases in mean CL and V values were noted with increasing dose of
        Advate and rFVIIIFc; however, increased intersubject variability at the 65 IU/kg coupled
        with limited dose levels confounded an assessment of the dose-dependency of these
        parameters.
[002131         Comparison of rFVIIIFc and Advate activity PK revealed an approximate 48-61%
        (One-Stage Assay) or 53-84% (Chromogenic Assay) increase in systemic exposure,
        approximate 30-40% reduction in clearance, and an approximate 50-80% increase in both
        elimination half-life and MRT for rFVIIIFc relative to Advate at comparable doses.
        Evidence of PK difference was also observed with rFVIIIFc demonstrating increased
        TBLP1 and TBLP3 values compared to Advate at equivalent doses. IVR and K-values
        for Advate and rFVIIIFc appeared to be comparable.
[002141         The PK parameters obtained from Chromogenic Assay results generally agreed
        with those from the One-Stage Assay, except that the Chomogenic Assay yielded a higher
        estimation of exposure parameters (e.g. Cmax, AUCINF, etc.).
[002151         With the observed improvements in PK, rFVIIIFc may provide a prolonged
        protection from bleeding, allowing less frequent injections for individuals with
        Hemophilia A.
                                            Example 8
[002161         On the basis of the interim PK analysis from the first-inhuman study of rFVIII:Fc
        (Example 3), the A-LONG study was designed. A-LONG is an open label, multi-center
        evaluation of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of recombinant Factor VIII Fc
        fusion (FVIII:Fc) in the prevention and treatment of bleeding in previously treated
        subjects with severe hemophilia A (defined as <1 IU/dL [<1%] endogenous FVIII).

                                                 - 58
[002171         Approximately 106 subjects will be enrolled into one of three regimens: a tailored
        prophylaxis regimen (arm 1), a weekly dosing regimen (arm 2), and an on-demand
        regimen (arm 3).
        Arm 1: Tailored Prophylaxis Regimen
[002181         Arm 1 will include an overall group and a PK subgroup. Approximately 66
        subjects will be enrolled. The initial regimen will be twice weekly at 25 IU/kg on the first
        day, followed by 50 IU/kg on the fourth day of the week.          Subjects will administer
        rFVIIIFc on this weekly prophylaxis regimen until PK results for rFVIIIFc are available.
        Base don these results, a tailored prophylaxis regimen will be established for each
        individual, in which the dose and interval will be determined to maintain a trough level of
        1-3% FVIII activity.       Each subject will then administer his individually tailored
        prophylaxis regimen throughout the study.
[002191         Subjects will be monitored throughout the study and ongoing dose and interval
        adjustments will be made. Adjustments will only be made when a subject experiences
        unacceptable bleeding episodes defined as >2 spontaneous bleeding episodes over a
        rolling two-month period. In this case, adjustment will target trough levels of 3-5%.
        Arm 2: Weekly Dosing Regimen
[002201         Approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled/randomized and undergo abbreviated
        rFVIIIFc PK profiling as follows: Washout of at least 96 hours; a single dose of rFVIIIFc
        65 IU/kg; Abbreviated sampling beginning on rFVIIIFc Day 0, including pre-injection
        and 10 (±2) minutes, 3 hours (1 15 minutes), 72 (± 2) hours [Day 3], and 96 (± 2) hours
        [Day 4] from the start of injection. Following the abbreviated PK profiling, subjects will
        then administer a fixed dose of 65 IU/kg rFVIIIFc every 7 days.
        Arm 3: On-demand Regimen
[002211         A minimum of 10 major surgeries in at least 5 subjects will be evaluated in the
        study. Major surgery is defined as any surgical procedure (elective or emergent) that
        involves general anesthesia and/or respiratory assistance in which a major body cavity is
        penetrated and exposed, or for which a substantial impairment of physical or
        physiological functions is produced (e.g., laparotomy, thoracotomy, craniotomy, joint
        replacement, and limb amputation).

                                                 -59
1002221         For prophylaxis during surgery, subjects will be treated with 35 to 50 IU/kg
        rFVIIIFc every 12 to 24 hours. Prior to surgery, the physician will review the subject's
        rFVIIIFc PK profile and assess the dose regimen of Factor VIII replacement generally
        required for the type of planned surgery and the clinical status of the subject.
        Recommendation for the appropriate dosing of rFVIIIFc in the surgical treatment period,
        including any rehabilitation time, will take these factors into consideration.
[002231         The primary objectives of this study are (a) to evaluate the safety and tolerability
        of rFVIIIFc administered as prophylaxis, on-demand, and surgical treatment regimens;
        and (b) to evaluate the efficacy of rFVIIIFc administered as prophylaxis, on-demand, and
        surgical treatment regimens.       The secondary objectives of this study are (a) to
        characterize the PK profile of rFVIIIFc and compare the PK of FVIIIFc with the currently
        marketed product, ADVATE; (b) to evaluate individual responses with FVIIIFc; and (c)
        to evaluate FVIIIFc consumption.

        Clinical ROTEM Assessment
1002241         In the study in Example 8, in addition to the measurement of plasma FVIII
        activity by one-stage activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay, whole blood
        rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) has also been explored to assess the
        improvement in global hemostasis by rFVIIIFc and Advate in 2 subjects, specifically, 1 in
        the low dose cohort and 1 in the high dose cohort.
1002251         rFVIIIFc and Advate appear to be comparably active in clot formation when
        spiked into subjects' blood prior to rFVIIIFc treatment. The clotting time (CT) was linear
        with respect to the dose of rFVIIIFc and Advate in the range of approximately 1% of
         100% of nonnal, and the dose response was comparable between rFVIIIFc and Advate in
        the same subject.
[00226]         Following dosing with Advate and subsequently rFVIIFec, citrated whole blood
        was sampled at various time points and the clot formation following recalcification was
        monitored by ROTEM. Despite the variable baseline CT due to residue FVIII levels prior
        to Advate or rFVIIIFc dosing, both products effectively corrected the CT to comparable
        levels 30 minutes post-injection. In addition, the improvement in CT was better sustained
        at and after 3 hours post-injection of 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc relative to Advate in the
        subject dosed at this low dose. However, the differential improvement of rFVIIIFc versus
        Advate was much less appreciable at the 65 IU/kg dose.
