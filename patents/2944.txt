   REVERSE COMBUSTION TYPE COMBUSTION APPARATUS
   CROSS-REFERENCE TO PRIORITY APPLICATION
   [0001]        The present application claims priority to Japanese patent
 5 application JP2017-000907 filed 6 January 2017, the entire contents of which is
   taken to be incorporated herein by reference.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   [0001a]       The present invention relates to a reverse combustion type
10 combustion apparatus, and more particularly relates to such a combustion
   apparatus that is provided with an improved construction for an exhaust box.
   [0001b]       The following discussion of the background to the invention is
   intended to facilitate an understanding of the invention. However, it should be
   appreciated that the discussion is not an acknowledgement or admission that any
15 aspect of the discussion was part of the common general knowledge as at the
   priority date of the application.
   [0001c]       Where any or all of the terms "comprise", "comprises", "comprised" or
   "comprising" are used in this specification (including the claims) they are to be
   interpreted as specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps or
20 components, but not precluding the presence of one or more other features,
   integers, steps or components.
   [0002]        From the past, heating devices with hot water supply function that
   are capable of operating by changing over between room heating operation and
   hot water supply operation have been widely employed. This type of heating
25 device with hot water supply function typically comprises a combustion means, a
   heat exchanger for supplying heat to a room heating thermal medium, a
   circulation passage that connects the heat exchanger and a room heating radiator
   unit, a circulation pump provided in the circulation passage, a bypass passage
   that bypasses the room heating radiator unit, a heat exchanger partway along the
30 bypass passage for supplying heat to cold water, and so on. In the case of
   relatively small combustion apparatuses of various types, including a heating
   device with hot water supply function of this type, in some cases, a reverse
                                              1

   combustion type combustion system is adopted, in which the fuel is combusted in
   a downward direction.
   [0003]         The hot water supply apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent
   Publication No.3,435,976 is built as a reverse combustion type combustion
 5 apparatus in which a burner is disposed below a fan, a heat exchanger is disposed
   below the burner, an exhaust box is disposed below the heat exchanger, and a
   muffler (i.e. an exhaust duct) that is connected to the exhaust box is disposed at
   the rear side of the fan, the burner, and the heat exchanger, so that combustion
   takes place downward from the burner.
10 [0004]         In a per se conventional reverse combustion type combustion
   apparatus, an exhaust box made from metal has been employed, but nowadays, in
   many cases, an exhaust box made from a synthetic resin material is being
   employed, and, since condensed water generated in the heat exchanger from the
   combustion exhaust gases drips down into the exhaust box, in order to enhance
15 the performance for drainage of this condensed water, the bottom portion of the
   exhaust box is formed, not in a flat shape, but in a concave shape composed of a
   plurality of inclined surfaces, with a discharge port being formed at its lowermost
   portion.
   [0005]         On the other hand, when a combustion apparatus is being assembled
20 on an assembly line, normally, an assembled equipment unit is manufactured in
   which a burner, a primary heat exchanger, a secondary heat exchanger, an
   exhaust box, and an exhaust duct are assembled together in the form of a unit,
   and this assembled equipment unit is then fitted into an outer casing together
   with other accessory equipment.
25 [0006]         When employing an exhaust box made from metal, which has
   excellent strength, as in the case of the reverse combustion type combustion
   apparatus of above described Japanese Patent, it is common to form the bottom
   surface of the exhaust box as flat, so that, when the combustion apparatus is to be
   assembled on the assembly line, an assembled equipment unit can first be
30 manufactured by attaching the heat exchangers and the burner to the exhaust
   box in the state in which the exhaust box is stood up by itself, and subsequently
   this assembled equipment unit is fitted into the outer casing.
                                              2

   [0007]        However, since an exhaust box that is made from a synthetic resin
   material can be manufactured in any desired shape, accordingly in many cases, as
   mentioned above, in order to enhance the performance for drainage of condensed
   water, the bottom portion of the exhaust box is formed, not in a flat shape, but in
 5 a concave shape that includes a plurality of inclined surfaces. In such a case, it is
   not possible to assemble the heat exchangers and the burner to the exhaust box in
   the state in which the exhaust box is standing up by itself.
   [0008]        As an alternative, it would also be possible to assemble the burner,
   the heat exchangers, and the exhaust box in a state in which they are laid down
10 on their sides, but in this case there is a danger that a part of one of the heat
   exchangers, or the passage portion of the exhaust duct, or a flange of a pipe
   connection portion or the like may be damaged; and this is also disadvantageous
   because the area which the assembled equipment unit occupies on the assembly
   line becomes larger.
15 [0009]        As another alternative, it would be possible to adopt a method of
   assembly in which a temporary stand made from wood or synthetic resin is
   prepared, the exhaust box is fixed on this temporary stand in a vertical attitude,
   and then the heat exchangers and the burner are assembled to the exhaust box.
   However, this method of assembly is disadvantageous because it involves an
20 additional manufacturing cost for the temporary stand and also a handling cost,
   and moreover it takes substantial time and effort to fix the exhaust box to the
   temporary stand and later to remove the completed assembly therefrom.
   [0010]        It is therefore desirable to provide a reverse combustion type
   combustion apparatus employing an exhaust box that is formed from synthetic
25 resin, and that has a construction which makes it stand up by itself.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   [0011]      The present invention presents a reverse combustion type combustion
   apparatus comprising: a combustion means that combusts fuel in a downward
30 direction; a heat exchanger disposed under the combustion means; and
   an exhaust box disposed under the heat exchanger; wherein the exhaust box is
   constituted with a molded product made from a synthetic resin material; the

   exhaust box comprises an opening portion formed at an upper portion for
   introduction of combustion exhaust gases , a fixing portion for fixing the heat
   exchanger, and an inclined bottom portion that collects condensed water
   generated by the heat exchanger; and a lower end portion of the exhaust box
 5 comprises a leg portion integrally formed which makes the exhaust box stand up
   by itself.
    [0012]       According to the structure described above, since the exhaust box is
   constituted with a molded product made from a synthetic resin material,
   accordingly the freedom in the design and the manufacture thereof are high, and
10 it can be manufactured at a cheap price. Moreover, it is possible for the
   combustion exhaust gases to be introduced thereinto through its opening portion,
   it is possible to fix the heat exchanger to its fixing portion, and it is possible to
   collect condensed water at its bottom portion.
           Furthermore, during assembly of the combustion apparatus, since it is
15 possible to make the exhaust collection portion stand up by itself on the leg
   portion on an assembly line, and since it is possible then to assemble the heat
   exchanger, the combustion means, and an exhaust duct to the exhaust box in a
   convenient manner, accordingly there is no danger of damage to any of these
   devices, and moreover it is possible to perform the assembly in a small working
20 area, and it is possible to perform assembly of the combustion apparatus without
   any waste of time and without any useless labor.
   [0013]      In a preferable first aspect of the present invention, the leg portion
   projects lower than the bottom portion of the exhaust box.
           According to this structure, without imposing any load upon the bottom
25 portion of the exhaust box, it is possible to support the exhaust box to which the
   heat exchanger and the combustion means are attached upon at least three leg
   portions.
   [0014]       In a preferable second aspect of the present invention, a discharge port
   for discharging the condensed water to the exterior is provided to the exhaust box.
30 According to this structure, it is possible reliably to discharge the condensed
   water from the discharge port to the exterior.
                                                4

   [0015]      In a preferable third aspect of the present invention, an exhaust duct
   for changing the direction of discharge of the introduced combustion exhaust
   gases to upward, and for discharging the combustion exhaust gases from an upper
   portion of the combustion apparatus to the exterior, is integrally connected to the
 5 exhaust box.
          According to this structure, it is possible to discharge the combustion
   exhaust gases from the upper portion of the combustion apparatus to the exterior
   via the exhaust duct, and it is possible to attach the exhaust duct to the exhaust
   box together with the heat exchanger and the combustion means.

                                                6

   [0020]        The outer casing 9 is formed from thin metallic plate as a box-shaped
   rectangular parallelepiped, and a front cover (not shown) is detachably installed
   on its front surface. The combustion section 2, the blower fan 3, an air intake
   portion 21 are disposed in an upper portion within the outer casing 9, with the
 5 primary heat exchanger 4 which is a fin-and-tube type heat exchanger being
   disposed beneath the combustion section 2, with the secondary heat exchanger 5
   which is a plate type heat exchanger being connected below this primary heat
   exchanger 4, and with the exhaust box 6 being connected below the secondary
   heat exchanger 5.
10 [0021]        As shown in Figs. 3 and 5 through 7, at a duct connection portion 22
   at the rear portion of the exhaust box 6, the direction of discharge of the
   combustion exhaust gases entering from the secondary heat exchanger 5 is
   changed into an upward direction, and furthermore an exhaust duct 8 for
   discharging the combustion gases from the upper part of the combustion
15 apparatus 1 to the exterior is integrally connected to this duct connection portion
   22.
   [0022]        When the combustion apparatus 1 described above is to be
   assembled upon an assembly line, a method of assembling the combustion
   apparatus 1 is employed in which the exhaust duct 8 is connected to the exhaust
20 box 6, an assembled equipment unit 23 (refer to Fig. 2) in which the secondary
   heat exchanger 5, the primary heat exchanger 4, the combustion section 2, the air

   6 and the exhaust duct 8, and then this assembled equipment unit 23 and other
   accessory equipments are fitted within the outer casing 9.
25 [0023]        The exhaust duct 8 is formed by integrally joining together a
   plurality of molded components that are made from synthetic resin. This exhaust
   duct 8 comprises a flattened passage forming section 24 constituting an exhaust
   passage 8a that extends upward from the duct connection portion 22 at the rear
   portion of the exhaust connecting plenum 6 to the upper end of the combustion
30 apparatus 1, and an exhaust gas venting aperture 25 continuing to the upper end
   of the passage forming section 24 and having a barrel portion. The exhaust
   passage 8a has a flattened elliptical shape in cross section, with its front-to-back
                                              7

   dimension being relatively small and its left-to-right dimension being relatively
   large. A plurality of longitudinal ribs 24a and a plurality of horizontal ribs 24b for
   reinforcement are formed on the outer surface of the passage forming section 24.
   And a pair of left and right fixing brackets 26 for fixing the secondary heat
 5 exchanger 5 are also formed at the lower portion of the passage forming section
   24.
   [0024]        Next, the exhaust box 6 will be explained.
   As shown in Fig. 3 and Figs. 5 through 9, the exhaust box 6 is built as a molded
   product that is quadrilateral in plan view and whose upper surface is open. The
10 exhaust box 6 comprises an opening portion 30, an exhaust collection portion 31
   through which the combustion exhaust gases G flow, a discharge port 32 that
   extends rearward from the rear edge of the exhaust collection portion 31 and that
   moreover is connected to the exhaust passage 8a in the exhaust duct 8, a fixing
   portion 33, a vertical wall portion 34, an inclined bottom portion 35, and a duct
15 connection portion 22.
   [0025]        The opening portion 30 is a large quadrilateral opening portion for
   collecting the combustion exhaust gases G from the secondary heat exchanger 5,
   and is formed at the upper side of the exhaust box 6.
   The fixing portion 33 is a horizontal fixing portion for fixing to fixing flanges 52,
20 55 that are provided around the external periphery of the casing 5a of the
   secondary heat exchanger 5; this fixing portion 33 is formed in the shape of a
   quadrilateral frame of a predetermined width around the external circumferential
   portion of the opening portion 30, with a plurality of screw holes 33c being formed
   in the fixing portion 33 for fixing the fixing flanges 52, 55, and with a convex edge
25 portion 33a that projects slightly upward being formed around the external
   circumference of the fixing portion 33.
   [0026]        A vertical surrounding wall portion 34 is a wall portion formed in the
   shape of a quadrilateral frame and extending downward from the internal
   peripheral portion of the fixing portion 33, and is formed in an L shaped cross
30 section in order to define a groove portion 50 that will be described hereinafter in
   cooperation with the exhaust rectifier plate 7. The lower edges of the left wall 34a
   and the right wall 34b of the vertical surrounding wall portion 34 are formed so as
                                               8

   to slope downward toward the front, and the front wall 34c of the vertical
   surrounding wall portion 34 is formed to have a constant width and to be
   continuous with the front edges of the left wall 34a and the right wall 34b. A
   horizontal shelf portion 34s is formed to continue from the lower edges of the left
 5 wall 34a, the right wall 34b, and the front wall 34c to the inside. The rear wall of
   the vertical surrounding wall portion 34 has a rear wall left end portion 34d
   continuous with the left wall 34a, and a rear wall right end portion 34f continuous
   with the right wall 34b.
   [0027]        A plurality of connecting portions 36a, 36b are formed in the
10 discharge port 32, and connect the fixing portion 33 and the bottom portion 35. An
   inclined bottom portion 35 for collecting condensed water (i.e. drain water)
   generated from the combustion exhaust gases G by the secondary heat exchanger
   5 comprises a peripheral wall portion 36, a horizontal plate portion 35a, a left side
   inclined plate portion 35b, a front side inclined plate portion 35c, and a rear side
15 inclined plate portion 35d (refer to Fig. 6).
   [0028]        The peripheral wall portion 36 is a formed as a quadrilateral wall
   frame portion, extending downward from the internal peripheral portions of the
   vertical surrounding wall portion 34 and the shelf portion 34s. The horizontal
   plate portion 35a is formed at the right side portion of the bottom portion 35 and
20 moreover at the central portion thereof in the front-to-rear direction, and
   constitutes the lowest portion of the bottom portion 35, with the right end portion
   of the horizontal plate portion 35a being connected to the right wall 36a of the
   peripheral wall portion 36. Moreover, the left side inclined plate portion 35b
   extends slopingly upward toward the left from the horizontal plate portion 35a,
25 and is connected to the left wall 36c of the peripheral wall portion 36.
   [0029]        The front side inclined plate portion 35c extends slopingly upward
   toward the front from the horizontal plate portion 35a, and connects to the front
   wall 36b and the right wall 36a of the peripheral wall portion 36. And the rear
   side inclined plate portion 35d extends slopingly upward toward the rear from the
30 horizontal plate portion 35a, and connects to the right wall 36a of the peripheral
   wall portion 36.
                                              9

    [0030]       The duct connection portion 22 is integrally formed at the rear
   portion of the exhaust box 6, and a lower end flange 8b of the exhaust duct 8 is
   joined to the upper end of the duct connection portion 22. A plurality of triangular
   ribs 37 are also provided for reinforcing the fixing portion 33 and the vertical
 5 surrounding wall portion 34.
            A drainage port 38a is provided at the bottom portion 35 of the exhaust
   box 6 for discharging condensed water collected on the bottom portion 35 to the
   exterior. This drainage port 38a consists of a horizontal drainage tube 38 that
   passes through the right wall 36a of the peripheral wall portion 36 and is
10 connected to the horizontal plate portion 35a, and that can drain away condensed
   water collected on the horizontal plate portion 35a.
    [0031]
           Four boss portions 39a, 39b for fixing the exhaust rectifier plate 7
   horizontally are formed at the four corners of the bottom portion 35 so as to
15 project upward, and a screw hole 39c is formed in the boss portion 39a at the right
   front corner, while vertically oriented pin portions 39d are formed integrally on
   the other three boss portions 39b.
    [0032]       At the lower end portion of the exhaust box 6, four legs 40 are
   formed unitarily at the four corner portions of the peripheral wall portion 36, and,
20 when the assembled equipment unit 23 shown in Fig. 2 is assembled, these four
   legs 40 make the exhaust box 6 stand up by itself upon a horizontal surface H as
   shown in Fig. 2. These legs 40 are L shaped in cross section, and project further
   downward than the bottom portion 35 of the exhaust box 6. The number of the
   legs 40 is not limited to being four; however, at least three legs 40 must be formed
25 in order for the exhaust box 6 to stand up by itself.
    [0033]       Next, the exhaust rectifier plate 7 will be explained.
           As shown in Figs. 3 through 9, the exhaust rectifier plate 7 is made as a
   molded product from a synthetic resin material. The exhaust rectifier plate 7
   comprises a main body portion 41 formed as a quadrilateral plate, and an outer
30 peripheral wall 42 formed integrally around the external peripheral portion of the
   main body portion 41.
                                             10

   [0034]         A plurality of holes 41a are formed in the plate shaped main body
   portion 41, for example in the form of a matrix having eight rows and eight
   columns. The diameters of the four columns of holes 41a in the central portion of
   the eight columns of holes 41a are set to be, for example, 1.5 to 2.0 times the
 5 diameters of the two columns of holes 41a on the left side portion and of the two
   colunms of holes 41a on the right side portion. This is done in order to allow more
   of the combustion exhaust gases G to flow through the central portion of the
   secondary heat exchanger 5, which has a large heat exchange capacity, than
   through its portions on the left and the right. The arrangement of the plurality of
10 holes is not limited to being an eight rows and eight colunms.
   [0035]         The diameters of the plurality of holes 41a become greater toward
   the upstream side (i.e. the front side) of the direction of exhaust gas flow within
   the exhaust box 6. This is because there is a tendency for a larger amount of the
   combustion exhaust gases G to flow through the rear half portion of the secondary
15 heat exchanger 5 which is the part closer to the exhaust duct 8, and is in order for
   the combustion exhaust gases G to flow equally over the entire secondary heat
   exchanger 5. In this manner, the opening areas of the holes 41a in the exhaust
   rectifier plate 7 are set so as to be larger on the upstream side (i.e. the front side)
   of the direction in which the combustion exhaust gases G flow within the exhaust
20 box 6. Due to this, it is possible to equalize the state of gas flow distribution of the
   combustion exhaust gases G flowing within the exhaust box 6.
   [0036]         As shown in Fig. 4, the upstream side half 41b and the downstream
   side half 41c of the exhaust rectifier plate 7 in the direction of the main body
   portion 41 through which the combustion exhaust gases flow are both formed so
25 as to be inclined downward to a central portion 41d at the middle of the direction
   of flow of the combustion exhaust gases in the exhaust box 6. Due to this, part of
   the condensed water that has dripped down from the heat exchanger 5 onto the
   exhaust rectifier plate 7 flows to the central portion 41d in the direction of flow of
   the combustion exhaust gases along the slopes of the upstream side half 41b and
30 the downstream side half 41c of the main body portion 41, and then drips from
   the plurality of holes 41a to the bottom portion of the exhaust box 6. Thus, since
   the droplets of condensed water that fall down to the bottom portion 35 become
                                               11

   larger, accordingly it becomes possible, to the greatest possible extent, to prevent
   discharge to the exhaust duct 8 of condensed water that is riding on the gas flow
   of the combustion exhaust gases G.
   [0037]         A screw hole 41e corresponding to the screw hole 39c in the boss
 5 portion 39a of the exhaust box 6 and three pin holes 41f corresponding to the
   three pin portions 39d of the three boss portions 39b are formed at the four corner
   portions of the main body portion 41. The exhaust rectifier plate 7 is fixed to the
   exhaust box 6 and positionally determined with respect thereto by mounting the
   exhaust rectifier plate 7 on the four boss portions 39a, 39b, by respectively
10 engaging the three pin portions 39d into the three pin holes 41f, and by screwing
   the screw 41g from above into the screw holes 39c, 41e.
   [0038]         As shown in Figs. 5 and 7 through 9, a groove portion 50 for flowing
   condensed water generated by the secondary heat exchanger 5 from the
   combustion exhaust gases G is provided around the periphery of the exhaust
15 rectifier plate 7. The groove portion 50 is formed to be an inclined shape that
   becomes lower toward the upstream side of the direction of flow of the combustion
   exhaust gases G in the exhaust box 6 and an opening portion 50s for discharge of
   condensed water from the groove portion 50 is formed in the bottommost portion
   of the groove portion 50. The groove portion 50 is formed in the shape of a
20 quadrilateral frame from a front side groove 50a, a left side groove 50b, a right
   side groove 50c, and a rear side groove 50d.
   [0039]         The front wall 42a, the left wall 42b, and the right wall 42c of the
   outer peripheral wall 42 of the exhaust rectifier plate 7 are formed in L shaped
   cross sections, and an outwardly oriented flange 42f is formed at the lower edges
25 thereof.
   The front wall 42a of the outer peripheral wall 42 is formed to be of almost the
   same size as the front wall 34c of the vertical surrounding wall portion 34 of the
   exhaust box 6, and a front side groove 50a of the groove portion 50 is defined to be
   horizontal by mounting the flange 42f around the lower edge of the front wall 42a
30 on the shelf portion 34s of the front wall 34c of the vertical surrounding wall
   portion 34. And a plurality (for example, five) of opening portions 50s for
                                               12

   discharging condensed water flowing in to the front side groove 50a to the bottom
   portion 35 are formed on the front wall 42a of the outer peripheral wall 42.
   [0040]         By the left wall 42b of the outer peripheral wall 42 being formed in a
   similar shape to and of almost the same size as the left wall 34a of the vertical
 5 surrounding wall portion 34 of the exhaust box 6, and by the flange 42f at the
   lower edge of the left wall 42b being mounted above the shelf portion 34s of the
   left wall 34a of the vertical surrounding wall portion 34, the left side groove
   portion 50b of the groove portion 50 is formed so as to be inclined downward
   toward the front, so that it becomes lower toward the upstream side of the
10 direction of flow of the combustion exhaust gases. In other words, the depth of the
   left side groove 50b becomes greater toward the front.
   [0041]         Similarly, by the right wall 42c of the outer peripheral wall 42 being
   formed in a similar shape to and of almost the same size as the right wall 34b of
   the vertical surrounding wall portion 34 of the exhaust box 6, and by the flange
15 42f at the lower edge of the right wall 42c being mounted above the shelf portion
   34s of the right wall 34b of the vertical surrounding wall portion 34, the right side
   groove portion 50c of the groove portion 50 is formed so as to be inclined
   downward toward the front, so that it becomes lower toward the upstream side of
   the direction of flow of the combustion exhaust gases. In other words, the depth of
20 the right side groove 50c becomes greater toward the front. Moreover, the rear
   side groove 50d of the groove portion 50 is formed between the rear wall 42d of
   the outer peripheral wall 42 and the rear edge portion 33b of the fixing portion 33.
   [0042]         In this manner, the groove portion 50 is formed in an inclined
   configuration that becomes lower toward the front, and the condensed water that
25 has dripped down into the groove portion 50 is collected in the front side groove
   50a, and flows from the plurality of opening portions 50s into the bottom portion
   35. And, as shown in Fig. 8, a connection portion 51 is provided for connecting the
   lower end portion of the secondary heat exchanger 5 into the upper end portion of
   the exhaust box 6, and this connection portion 51 is built so that the lower end
30 portion of the secondary heat exchanger 5 engages into the groove portion 50.
   [0043]         A fixing flange 52 formed in cross section of a cranked shape is joined
   to the lower end portions of the front surface plate, the left side plate, and the
                                               13

   right side plate of a casing 5a of the secondary heat exchanger 5, and this fixing
   flange 52 is mounted on the upper surface of the fixing portion 33 of the exhaust
   box 6 via a packing 53, and is fixed there by a plurality of screws 54. In this fixed
   state, the lower end portions of the casing 5a and the fixing flange 52 are fitted
 5 into and engaged in the groove portion 50, and a gap is defined between the
   casing 5a and the outer peripheral wall 42 of the exhaust rectifier plate 7.
   [0044]         Thus, condensed water that drips down along the inner surfaces of
   the casing 5a of the secondary heat exchanger 5 into the groove portion 50,
   together with condensed water that trickles down along the plates of the heat
10 exchanger 5 and reaches its lower end and, after having flowed to the side of the
   casing 5a, drips down within the groove portion 50, is collected in the front side
   groove 50a via the inclinations of the left side groove 50b and of the right side
   groove 50c, and passes from the front side groove 50a through the plurality of
   opening portions 50s, to be then discharged to the bottom portion 35 of the
15 exhaust box 6.
   [0045]         Since, as shown in Fig. 8, the rear surface plate of the casing 5a of
   the secondary heat exchanger 5 is located in a position somewhat separated from
   and more forward than the rear edge of the exhaust rectifier plate 7, accordingly
   the condensed water that drips down from the rear surface plate falls down onto
20 the exhaust rectifier plate 7, but does not fall down into the rear side groove 50d.
   A casing plate 5b is fixed to the rear surface plate of the casing 5a and is
   positioned more rearward than that rear surface plate, a fixing flange 55 that is
   crank shaped in cross section is fixed to the lower end portion of the casing plate
   5b, the fixing flange 55 is fixed by a plurality of screws 57 to the fixing portion 33
25 of the exhaust box 6 with a packing 56 interposed therebetween, and the lower
   end portions of the casing plate 56 and the fixing flange 55 are fitted into and
   engaged with the rear side groove 50d.
   [0046]         Next, the operation and the beneficial effects of the reverse
   combustion type combustion apparatus 1 will be explained.
30         Since the exhaust box 6 is built as a molded product made from a synthetic
   resin material, the freedom for its design and manufacture is high, and it can be
   manufactured at low cost. Conveniently, the combustion exhaust gases G can be
                                              14

   introduced into the exhaust box 6 from the opening portion 30 of the exhaust box
   6, the secondary heat exchanger 5 can be fixed to the fixing portion 33 of the
   exhaust box 6, and condensed water can be collected at its bottom portion 35.
   [0047]          Since, when the combustion apparatus 1 is to be assembled, it is
 5 possible to stand the exhaust box 6 up by itself on the assembly line on its four
   legs 40, and it is possible then conveniently to assemble the primary and
   secondary heat exchangers 4, 5, the combustion section 2, and the exhaust duct 8
   to the exhaust box 6, accordingly there is no fear of damage to the various parts,
   it is possible to perform assembly of the combustion apparatus 1 in a relatively
10 small working area, and it is possible to perform this assembly without any waste
   of time or labor.
   [0048]          Since at least three of the legs 40 are provided for making it possible
   for the exhaust box 6 to stand up by itself, accordingly, without imposing any
   undue load upon the bottom portion 35 of the exhaust box 6, it is possible for the
15 exhaust box 6 to stand up by itself with the combustion section 2, the primary
   heat exchanger 4, the secondary heat exchanger 5, the exhaust duct 8, and so on
   all having been assembled thereto.
   [0049]          And, since the drainage port 38a for drainage of condensed water is
   formed on the exhaust box 6, accordingly it is possible reliably to drain condensed
20 water from the drainage port 38a to an external neutralizer.
           It is possible to assemble the exhaust duct 8 to the exhaust box 6 along
   with the primary and secondary heat exchangers 4, 5 and the combustion section
   2, and thus, with the exhaust duct 8 being connected to the exhaust box 6, it is
   possible for the combustion exhaust gases G in the exhaust box 6 to be discharged
25 to the exterior from the top of the combustion apparatus 1, via this exhaust duct
   8.
   [0050]          Since the plurality of holes 41a are formed in the main body portion
   41 of the plate-shaped exhaust rectifier plate 7, accordingly, by appropriately
   setting the diameters of the plurality of holes 41 according to their positions on
30 the main body portion 41, it is possible appropriately to adjust the state of gas
   flow distribution of the combustion exhaust gases G flowing within the secondary
   heat exchanger 5.
                                                15

          Condensed water that has dripped down from the wall surface of the casing
   5a of the secondary heat exchanger 5 onto the groove portion 50, together with
   condensed water that flows down along the lower end of the second heat
   exchanger 5 to the side of the casing 5a and drips down onto the groove portion
 5 50, flows along the slope of the groove portion 50 upstream against the flow
   direction of the combustion exhaust gases (i.e. toward the front), and is
   discharged to the bottom portion 35 of the exhaust box 6 from the opening portion
   50a that is formed at the lowest portion of the groove portion 50.
   [0051]         Since, in this manner, the condensed water is collected in the front
10 side groove 50a of the groove portion 50, and flows into the exhaust box 7 at the
   position therein that is furthest from the exhaust duct 8 which is on the most
   downstream side of the exhaust box 6, accordingly it is possible to prevent the
   condensed water from being carried on the gas flow of the combustion exhaust
   gases G toward the exhaust duct 8.
15 [0052]         Since the connection portion 51 that connects the lower end portion
   of the secondary heat exchanger 5 and fits into the upper end portion of the
   exhaust box 6 is provided, and since it is arranged for the lower end portion of the
   secondary heat exchanger 5 to be engaged into the groove portion 50 by this
   connection portion 51, accordingly the condensed water that has flowed down
20 from the casing 5a of the secondary heat exchanger 5 to the connection portion 51
   and the condensed water that has flowed to the side of the casing 5a along the
   lower end of the secondary heat exchanger 5 reliably drip down from the
   connection portion 51 into the groove portion 50.
   [0053]         A part of the condensed water that has dripped down onto the
25 exhaust rectifier plate 7 from the secondary heat exchanger 5 flows in the
   direction of flow of the combustion exhaust gases 41 to the central portion 41d
   along the inclinations of the upstream side half 41b and the downstream side half
   41c of the main body portion 41, and then drips down from the plurality of holes
   41a formed in the main body portion 41 to the bottom portion 35 of the exhaust
30 box 6. Thus it is possible, to the greatest extent possible, to prevent condensed
   water from being carried on the gas flow of the combustion exhaust gases and
   being discharged to the exhaust duct 8.
                                              16

   [0054]         Since the opening areas of the holes 41a in the exhaust rectifier plate
   7 are set to be larger toward the upstream side of the direction in which the
   combustion exhaust gases flow in the exhaust box 6, accordingly it is possible to
   make the state of gas flow distribution of the combustion exhaust gases G flowing
 5 in the secondary heat exchanger 5 more uniform.
   [0055]         Next, variant examples in which the above embodiment is partially
   altered will be explained.
           1) It will be acceptable to form the groove portion 50 integrally with the
   exhaust rectifier plate 7 at only the external circumferential portion of the
10 exhaust rectifier plate 7. Alternatively, it will be acceptable to arrange to form the
   groove portion 50 integrally with the vertical surrounding wall portion 34 only at
   the internal peripheral portion of the vertical surrounding wall portion 34. In that
   case, it would be possible to omit the flange 42f of the outer peripheral wall 42 of
   the exhaust rectifier plate 7.
15 [0056]         2) In the downstream side half 41c of the exhaust rectifier plate 7, it
   would also be acceptable to arrange to form circular burrings that are convex
   upward around the peripheral parts of the holes 41a. In this case, since the
   condensed water that drips down onto the downstream side half 41c of the
   exhaust rectifier plate 7 all flows to the bottom portion 35 of the exhaust box 6
20 only after having been collected at that central portion 41d, accordingly it is
   difficult for any of this water to be discharged to the exhaust duct 8 by being
   carried on the gas flow of the combustion exhaust gases.
   [0057]         3) Apart from the above, for a person skilled in the art, without
   deviating from the gist of the present invention, it would be possible to implement
25 the present invention in various forms by making additions of various types to the
   embodiment described above; and the present invention is to be considered as
   encompassing modifications of this kind.
