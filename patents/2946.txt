                                          ABSTRACT
A seabed plow capable of over-the-stern release and retrieval is usable in any of boulder
clearing, trench cutting and backfill modes. In its boulder clearing mode, the plow uses its skid
in torqueing configuration followed by moldboards to push boulders out of the path to be
trenched. In the trench cutting mode, the plow uses the skid in the same configuration with its
share and moldboards for initial trench depth and the same share and moldboards with
moldboard extensions for increasing trench depth in subsequent passes. In the backfill mode,
the plow uses its skid in trench-straddling configuration following a blade with a passage
designed to discharge fragmented spoil directly onto the pipe being covered. Thus, a single
plow can be reconfigured for all modes for release and retrieval to and from a relatively small
vessel without used of heavy lifting equipment.

   by reference in its entirety.
LO          Background of the Invention:
            This invention relates generally to the offshore laying of pipe and cable and more
   particularly concerns equipment used in the preparation and trenching of the seabed to receive
   the pipe or cable and in the backfilling of the trench once the pipe or cable has been laid.
            Present pipe laying methods include a few basic seabed trenching tasks performed using
L5 long-accepted, time-consuming, budget-eating practices and equipment.
            One problem is that sometimes, before trenching can begin, it may be necessary to clear
   the seabed of boulders on, or partially buried in, the intended pipeline path. Presently, the
   boulder removal process involves dragging the boulders, one at a time, at cables-end from a
   transport/towing vessel. In some boulder fields, this can be a lengthy and tedious process. It
zo always requires one or more divers, a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), or other boulder
   handling mechanisms to connect the cable to the boulder.
            Another problem is that, when the time for trench cutting arrives, a trench cutting plow
   must be lowered to the seabed.       Launching a trench cutting plow typically requires a large
   vessel carrying a crane and supporting equipment to lift the plow from the vessel, to swing the
25 plow clear of the deck and to lower the plow into the sea. After its final trench cutting pass,
   retrieval of the trench cutting plow from the seabed to its storage area on the towing vessel
   again requires use of the crane and supporting equipment. In operation on the seabed, known
   trench cutting plows have additional problems.          For example, many require skids which
   straddle the width of the trench being cut, so the number of possible passes that can be made
30 and the depth of the trench that can be cut is limited.
            Similar problems are experienced in the backfilling of the trench to cover the pipe.
   First, a heavy backfill plow must be lowered to the seabed. As with launching trench cutting
   plows, launching known backfill plows typically requires a large vessel and a crane and
   supporting equipment to raise the plow from the vessel, to swing the plow clear of the deck and

                                                      2
   to lower the plow into the sea. After its final pass the backfill plow must be retrieved from the
   seabed and returned to its place on the towing vessel by use of the crane and supporting
   equipment. In operation of the backfill plow on the seabed, one or more passes of the plow are
   necessary to cover the pipeline and fill the trench. Typical known backfill plows have chasses
 5 with front skids which travel in the trench and straddle the pipeline, followed by moldboards
   which are angled forwardly and away from the chassis to collect the spoil in their path and
   deposit it in the trench to the sides of the pipeline. Since the skids ride in the trench in close
   proximity to the pipeline, there is significant risk that contact with the skids will compromise
   the integrity of the pipe. Also, since the mixture of seawater and spoil, which is more dense
10 than the hollow pipe, is pushed by the moldboards to the outer limits of the trench and
   discharged to the sides of the pipe, there is a significant risk that, as the spoil settles, the pipe
   will "float," resulting in inadequate burial of the pipeline.
           Much of the seabed trenching task equipment and operating methods are, in terms of
   time and money, very inefficient and beg for improvement.              But the inadequacy of the
15 individual plows and their operating methods is dwarfed by the need for a large, heavily
   equipped vessel to transport, launch and retrieve these plows instead of a much smaller vessel
   which could otherwise be used for operating purposes. Typically, the cost of known trench
   cutting and backfill plows is in a range of $8,000,000 each. The cost of the transport/towing
   vessel with the crane and supporting equipment is in a range of $500,000,000. The rental fee
zo for the vessel and plows ranges from $150,000 to $600,000 per day.
           Accordingly, it is an object for one or more embodiments of this invention to reduce the
   weight and cost and increase the efficiency of the plows, equipment and vessels used in the
   offshore laying of pipe and cable.

                                                      3
   Summary of the Invention:
                                     Single and Multi-Mode Chasses
            In accordance with the invention, a seabed-plow chassis is provided in which an
   elongated member is adapted for mounting a skid on one of its ends to support that end above
 5 the seabed and is adapted for mounting one or more tools on its other end to perform a variety
   of seabed trenching tasks.
            In a first mode of operation in which the chassis is a part of a boulder clearing plow, the
   tool consists of moldboards for clearing boulders which are initially pushed by the skid outward
   of the path traveled by the skid further outward from the path as the skid leads the moldboards
10 along the seabed.
            In a second mode of operation in which the chassis is a part of a trench cutting plow, the
   tool consists of a plow share and moldboards for sequentially cutting and moving spoil to create
   a trench as the skid leads the plow share and moldboards along the seabed.
            In a third mode of operation in which the chassis is a part of a backfill plow, the tool
15 consists of a blade and moldboards which cooperate as the blade and moldboards lead the skid
   along the seabed to sequentially collect, funnel inward and release downward into the trench
   spoil lying outside of the trench.
            Different chasses can be adapted to accommodate each of the modes or the same chassis
   can be adapted to interconnect any of the tools with the skid according to the desired mode of
ZO operation.
            The elongated member of the chassis may have one or more permanent transition
   surfaces or one or more attachments providing transition surfaces. The transition surfaces are
   configured to extend between the skid and the various tools which may be mounted on the
   chassis.    The transition surface contours are shaped and located so that the appropriate
25 transition surface makes contact with and pivots about a fulcrum on the stern of a plow
   transporting/towing vessel as the plow crosses that fulcrum during its release from the vessel
   into the sea and during its retrieval from the sea onto the vessel. The shapes and locations of
   the transition surfaces and the weight of the elongated member are coordinated so as to resist
   roll of the chassis about a transition axis as the plow moves on the deck or across the fulcrum.
30          Preferably, the vertical longitudinal cross-sections of the transition surfaces are concave,
   the fulcrum is a roller and the paths defined by continuous symmetrically opposite points of the
   transition surfaces are contoured to maintain contact with the roller as the plow crosses the
   roller.

                                                     4
            In a preferred embodiment of the chassis for use in more than one mode of operation, a
   first transition surface is configured to extend between the skid and the tool in the first/boulder
   clearing and third/backfill modes and a second transition surface is configured to extend
   between the skid and the tool in the second/trench cutting mode.
 5                                Boulder Clearing Plow and Methods
            For clearing boulders from a seabed, the plow includes the chassis, a skid mounted on
   and supporting one end of the chassis above the seabed and moldboards mounted on and
   oriented in angular relationship to the other end of the chassis. The trailing moldboards clear
   boulders initially pushed outwardly by the leading skid further outward as the skid leads the
10 moldboards along the seabed.
            In a preferred embodiment of the boulder clearing plow, a head is mounted on a leading
   end of the skid. The head has leading faces angled rearward from a vertical, longitudinal center
   plane of the skid and tapered rearward from its top edges, enabling the head to torque boulders
   partially buried in the seabed away from the skid. The chassis transition surface extends
15 between the skid and the moldboards and is contoured to maintain contact with and pivot about
   the fulcrum/roller on the stern of the vessel as the plow crosses the fulcrum during launch and
   recovery.
            The boulder clearing plow may also include keel plates, at least one keel plate extending
   under each moldboard. The heel plates' primary function is to ensure the lateral stability of the
zo plow during operation by resisting departure of the plow from its intended path even when the
   plow encounters seabed obstructions or uneven amounts of spoil.
            The plow components are, in weight and in their contact surfaces with the fulcrum,
   coordinated to resist roll of the plow about a launch and recovery transition axis of the boulder
   clearing plow.
25          Pulling points for connection of a pulling line to the boulder clearing plow are
   symmetrically arranged in relation to the longitudinal axis of the chassis and are displaced from
   the bottom of the boulder clearing plow by a height less than a radius of the vessel roller to
   facilitate passage of the plow contact surface over the vessel roller.
            The method of clearing boulders from a path on the seabed includes the steps of
30 positioning the plow bow-forward in the direction of an initial seabed path and then propelling
   the plow along the initial seabed path to push boulders lying in the initial seabed path to the port
   and starboard sides of the plow. After the initial path is cleared the method continues, if a
   wider path is necessary, with the step of repositioning the plow bow-forward in a direction
   opposite the initial seabed path direction and on a second seabed path along one of the port and

                                                     5
   starboard sides of the initial seabed path. Once so repositioned, the method continues with the
   step of propelling the plow along the second seabed path to push boulders from the second
   seabed path further to one of the starboard and port sides of the plow, respectively. After the
   second path is cleared the method continues, if an even wider path is necessary, with the step of
 5 repositioning the plow bow-forward in the direction of the initial seabed path and on a third
   seabed path along the other of the starboard and port sides of the initial seabed path. Once so
   repositioned, the method continues with the step of propelling the plow along the third seabed
   path to push boulders from the third seabed path further to the other of the starboard and port
   sides of the plow, respectively. If a still wider path is necessary, the method can further include
10 repeating the above widening steps in relation to the path resulting from the contiguity of the
   initial, second and third paths. The method anticipates repeating these steps for successively
   contiguous paths until a single path of desired width has been cleared along the seabed.
            For the over-the-stem boulder clearing plow herein disclosed, the method of clearing
   boulders from the seabed path is preceded by the steps of propelling the plow on the deck of the
15 vessel toward and across the fulcrum on the stern of the vessel, allowing the plow to rotate
   about the fulcrum as the plow crosses the fulcrum and is released from the fulcrum into the sea
   and lowering the released plow at tow-line end toward the seabed. Furthermore, the method of
   clearing boulders from the seabed path is followed by the steps of raising the plow at tow-line
   end toward the fulcrum on the stem of the vessel at the other end of the tow line and pulling the
Zo plow across the fulcrum onto the deck of the vessel.
                                      Backfill Plow and Methods
            For backfilling spoil into a seabed trench, the plow includes the chassis, a skid
   supporting the aft end of the chassis above the seabed, moldboards mounted on the chassis
   forward of the skid and a blade mounted on and spanning the bottom edges of the moldboards.
25 The blade collects the spoil in its path as the plow travels forward on the seabed.             The
   moldboards are sized and oriented to span the trench and funnel the collected spoil toward the
   center of the blade as the plow travels forward on the seabed. The blade has a passage at its
   rear apex which is configured to dispense the collected and funneled spoil onto the top of a pipe
   disposed in the trench below the passage.
30          In a preferred embodiment, the backfill plow further includes a flapper board aft of the
   passage which fragments spoil discharged through the passage. The flapper board consists of a
   plate swinging below a horizontal shaft with a weight biasing the plate toward a vertical
   orientation.

                                                     6
           The skid is configured to straddle the trench and includes a crossbar mounted on the rear
   end of the chassis, a pair of skid posts, one on each end of the crossbar, and a pair of skis, one
   on the bottom of each post. The front surface of the crossbar may be adapted to the level spoil
   which has been discharged into the trench.
 5         The backfill plow may also include at least two keel plates spaced apart under the blade.
   The primary function of the keel plates is to ensure the lateral stability of the plow during
   operation by resisting departure of the backfill plow from its intended path even when the plow
   encounters seabed obstructions or uneven amounts of spoil.
           The plow has at least one transition surface between the skid and the moldboards which
10 is contoured to contact and pivot about the fulcrum on the stern of a vessel as the backfill plow
   crosses the fulcrum during launch and retrieval of the backfill plow from and to the vessel.
           The plow components are, in weight and in contact surfaces with the fulcrum,
   coordinated to resist roll of the backfill plow about the transition axis of the plow.
           Pulling points for connection of a pulling line to the backfill plow are symmetrically
15 arranged in relation to the longitudinal axis of the chassis and are displaced from the bottom of
   the backfill plow by a height less than the radius of the roller to facilitate passage of the plow
   contact surfaces over the roller.
           The method of backfilling spoil into a seabed trench includes the steps of propelling the
   blade to travel forward on the seabed and collect spoil along the sides of the trench, funneling
zo the collected spoil toward a rear apex of the blade and allowing the funneled spoil to be
   discharged through an opening in the blade apex and onto a top surface of a pipe disposed in the
   trench. The method may further include one or both of the steps of fragmenting the discharged
   spoil before the discharged spoil reaches the pipe and/or leveling the spoil after it is discharged
   into the trench.
25         For the over-the-stern backfill plow herein disclosed, the method of backfilling spoil
   into the trench is preceded by the steps of propelling the backfill plow on the deck of the vessel
   toward and across the fulcrum on the stem of the vessel, allowing the backfill plow to rotate
   about the fulcrum as the plow crosses the fulcrum and is released from the fulcrum into the sea
   and lowering the released plow at tow-line end to the seabed.          Furthermore, the method of
30 backfilling spoil into the trench can be followed by the steps of raising the backfill plow at tow
   line end toward the fulcrum on the stem of the vessel at the other end of the tow line and
   pulling the plow across the fulcrum onto the deck of the vessel.
           As a result of the above plow structures and methods, the vessels needed for transport,
   launch, recovery and operation of the plows are smaller and presently plentiful.           They are

                                                      7
   available to the user at rental fees ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 per day. This is a huge
   savings in comparison to the $150,000 to $600,000 per day rental fees presently paid for vessels
   required by the old plow structures and methods.

                                                    10
   Detailed Description:
                                Single Mode and Multi-Mode Chasses
           Turning first to Figures 1-5, a seabed-plow chassis 10 for use as a component of various
   seabed plows has an elongated member 11 adapted for mounting a skid on one of its ends 13
 5 and one or more tools on its other end 15.
           As seen in Figures 13-17, the chassis 10 is used in a first mode of operation as part of a
   boulder clearing plow 100.     In the first mode 100, boulders B on or partially buried in the
   seabed are initially pushed by the skid 40 outward of the path P traveled by the skid 40. The
   tool includes moldboards 90 which push the boulders B initially pushed away by the skid 40
LO and other boulders B in the path of the moldboards 90 further outward as the skid 40 leads the
   moldboards 90 along the seabed S.
           As seen in Figures 26-29, the chassis 10 is used in a second mode of operation as part of
   a trench cutting plow 200. In the second mode 200, the tool includes a plow share 210 and
   moldboards 90 which sequentially cut and move spoil M to create a trench T as the skid 40
L5 leads the plow share 210 and the moldboards 90 along the seabed S.
           As seen in Figures 37-40, the chassis 10 is used in a third mode of operation as part of a
   backfill plow 300. In the third mode 300, the tool includes a blade 310 and moldboards 90
   which cooperate, as the blade 310 and moldboards 90 lead the skid 40 along the seabed S, to
   sequentially collect spoil M lying outside of the trench, funnel the collected spoil M inward,
zo and release the funneled spoil M downward into the trench T.
           The chassis 10 is uniquely configured to facilitate over-the-stem launch and retrieval of
   a plow 100, 200 or 300 from and to, respectively, the deck D of a vessel V and to and from,
   respectively, the seabed S. The movement of the plow 100, 200 or 300 from or to a resting
   place on the deck D of the vessel V to or from a point at which all contact of the plow 100, 200
25 or 300 with the vessel V is terminated is herein referred to as "transition." Looking at Figures
   15, 27 and 38, the plows 100, 200 or 300 described herein have longitudinal axes 101, 201 and
   301, respectively. As shown, the longitudinal axes 101, 201 and 301 are aligned in parallel
   with their anticipated directions of movement on the seabed S. Looking at Figures 19-22, 33
   36 and 43-46, the plow axes 103, 203 and 303 are aligned in the direction of "transition" of the
30 plows 100, 200 and 300, respectively, on the deck D. As shown, the longitudinal axes 101,
   201, and 103 of Figures 15, 27 and 38 are aligned with the transition axes 103, 203, and 303 of
   Figures 19-22, 33-36 and 42-46, respectively. The plows 100, 200 and 300 need not, however,
   be aligned on the deck D in the same orientation they assume in operation on the seabed S.
   Therefore, as used herein, a "transition" axis" is any axis, longitudinal or not, which extends

                                                     11
   through a plow 100, 200 or 300 in a direction parallel to the anticipated direction of movement
   39 of the plow during launch or retrieval.
            It is preferred that the plows 100, 200 or 300 will have their weight distribution and the
   location of their surfaces which contact the deck D and the fulcrum/roller R on the stem of the
 5 vessel V during release or retrieval so coordinated as to resist roll of the plows 100, 200 or 300
   about their respective transition axes 103, 203 and 303, respectively. As shown and described,
   the chassis 10, skid 40 and skid posts 45, transition attachment 70, moldboards 90 and keel
   plates 110 and 370 have various surfaces contoured to support their plows in sliding contact
   with the deck D and to pivot about the fulcrum/roller R on the stern of the vessel V as the plow
10 100, 200 or 300 crosses the fulcrum/roller R during release/retrieval of the plow.            Other
   components can be used or specially added for the purpose.
                                             Chassis Structure
            Returning to Figures 1-5, a preferred embodiment of the chassis 10 can be used in any
   of the plow modes 100, 200 and 300 seen in Figures 13, 26 and 37, respectively. As best seen
15 in Figures 1 and 2, in the preferred embodiment of the chassis 10, the skid and tool ends 13 and
   15 of the elongated member 19 are substantially horizontal and joined by a midsection 27
   which angles down from the skid end 13 to the tool end 15.           A post receptacle 19 extends
   vertically through the skid end 13. Fork lift receptacles 21 extend widthwise across the top of
   the tool end 15 of the elongated member 11. One receptacle 21 is at the junction of the tool end
Zo 15 with the angled portion 17 of the elongated member 11. The other receptacle 21 is further to
   the rear of the elongated member 11 and immediately in front of a spaced pair of share
   connection plates 23 which extend above the elongated member 11.
            A transition member 25 extends above the tool end 15 of the elongated member 11
   between the fork lift receptacles 21. As best seen in Figure 3, the top surfaces of the receptacles
25 21, the share connection plates 23 and the transition member 25 form a substantially continuous
   transition surface 27 useful for launch and recovery purposes as hereinafter explained in
   relation to the second/trench cutting mode 200.
            Side extension plates 29 taper downwardly from the tool end 15 and a back flange plate
   31 caps the tool end 15 of the elongated member 11.           A share connection slot 33 extends
30 through the bottom of the tool end 15 of the elongated member 11 between the share connection
   plates 23.
            Looking at Figures 13-17, 26-29 and 37-40, each of the plows 100, 200 and 300 has
   pulling points 65, as shown on tow bars 67 extending laterally from the skid end 13 of the
   elongated member 11, for connection of a pulling line L to the plow 100, 200 and 300.

                                                       12
    Preferably, the pulling points 65 are symmetrically arranged in relation to the central
    longitudinal axes 101, 201 and 301 of the plows 100, 200 and 300 and are displaced from the
    points of contact of the plows 100, 200 and 300 with the deck D or roller R by a height less than
    a radius of the roller R to facilitate passage of the points of contact across the roller R.
 5                                          Transition Attachment
             Turning to Figures 6-9, a transition attachment 70 is configured to extend between the
    skid and tool ends 13 and 15 on the bottom of the elongated member 11 of the chassis 10 when
    the chassis is used in either of its first/boulder clearing or third/trench cutting modes 100 or 300
    as seen in Figures 13, 26 and 37.
LO           As shown in Figures 6-9, the transition attachment 70 extends in a generally horizontal
    wishbone shape with its tines 71 opening from its front to its rear ends 73 and 75.           The top
    surface 77 of the transition attachment 70 is contoured to mate against the bottom surface 31 of
    the elongated member 11 of the chassis 10 against which the transition attachment 70 will be
    secured by pinning the transition member 25 of the chassis 10 between the transition clevis
L5  plates 83, as is best seen in Figures 16 and 39.           The bottom surface 79 of the transition
    attachment 70 is contoured to make contact with and pivot about fulcrum R on the stern of a
    plow transporting/towing vessel V, seen in Figures 21 and 22 and 44 and 45, as the plow 100 or
    300 crosses the fulcrum/roller R during its release from the vessel into the sea and during its
    retrieval from the sea onto the vessel.
 ZO          The shape of the attachment bottom surface 79 and the weight of the elongated member
    11 and attachment 70 are coordinated so as to resist roll of the chassis 11 about the plow
    transition axis 103 or 303 as the plow 100 or 300 moves on the deck D toward or away from the
    fulcrum R.
             Preferably, the fulcrum R is a roller and, as best seen in Figure 9, the vertical
25  longitudinal cross-sections of the attachment bottom surface 79 are concave.               Looking at
    Figures 16, 39 and 50, the radius of the concavity 79 is greater than the radius of the fulcrum R
    so as to facilitate passage of the transition attachment 70 across the fulcrum R during release
    and retrieval of the plows 100 and 300. Looking at Figure 8, the concavity 79 is symmetric
    about a longitudinal vertical plane centered on the attachment 70. The surface 79 can have any
30  shape as long as it provides paths which facilitate the over-the-stern release and retrieval of the
    plow 100 or 300. The paths may be linear or planar and are preferably symmetrically defined
    by continuous opposite points of the attachment bottom surface 79.
             As shown, the front end 73 of the attachment 70 has a leading face 81 which is angled to
    smooth the transition to and from the skid end 13 of the elongated member 11 of the chassis 10.

                                                    13
   Back plates 85 are provided on the ends of the tines 71 for connection to the moldboards 90.
   The gap 87 between the tines 71 functions as a passageway for debris in the third/backfill mode
   300, as is hereinafter explained.
                                                   Skid
 5          Turning to Figures 10 and 11, a preferred embodiment of the skid 40 is adaptable for
   use in any of the plow modes 100, 200 and 300 seen in Figures 13, 26 and 37, respectively.
            In Figure 10, the skid 40 is shown configured for use in the first/boulder clearing and
   second/trench cutting modes 100 and 200, seen in Figures 13 and 26, respectively. When used
   in the first/boulder clearing or second/trench cutting mode 100 or 200, the parallel outer skis 41
LO of the skid 40 are in close proximity to each other, bolted on opposite sides of a center ski 43.
   In this bolted configuration, a head 51 can be mounted on the front of the skis 41 and 43 in
   either the first/boulder clearing mode or for a first pass, the second/trench cutting mode 100 or
   200. Alternatively, as shown in Figure 12, the outer skis 41 can be pivotally mounted on the
   center ski 43 using linkages 48 so that the outer skis 41 can be canted laterally upward from the
L5 center ski 43, provided the head 51 is not attached to the skis 41 and 43. The use of canted
   outer skis 41 is specially applicable to second and subsequent passes in this second/trench
   cutting mode 200, enabling the canted skis 41 to conform to the side walls of the trench T and
   facilitating the deepening of the trench T by a second and subsequent passes of the trench
   cutting plow 200. Thus, deeper trenches can be cut without need for a larger trenching plow.
 o          In of the above bolted or pivotal configurations for the outer skis 41, whether or not the
   head 51 is used, a post 45, which is pinned in a receptacle 47 in the center ski 43, extends
   upward to a top 49 which is convex from front to back. As shown, the outer skis 41 have
   receptacles 47 which are the same as the center ski receptacles 47.             When used in the
   first/boulder clearing mode 100, the boulder clearing head 51 is preferably added to the leading
25 end of the skid 40 across the fronts of the skis 41 and 43. As shown, the leading faces 53 of the
   head 51 are angled rearward from a vertical, longitudinal center plane of the skid 40 and are
   tapered rearward from their top edges 55. The angled and tapered faces 53 will torque partially
   buried boulders out of the seabed and away from the skid 40 and, if necessary, allow the plow
   200 to ride over a boulder B which strikes the head 51 below its top edges 55.
30          When used in the second/trench cutting mode 200, either the bolted configuration of the
   skis 41 or the pivotal configuration of the skis 41 in an uncanted condition can be used,
   preferably with the head 51 in place for the first pass of the plow 200. For subsequent passes, it
   is preferred that the pivotal configuration of the skis 41 be used in the canted condition without

                                                    14
   the head 51. In the second/trench cutting mode 200, trenches up to 25 meters wide can be cut
   using multiple passes.
           In Figure 11, a crossbeam 57 is shown for converting the outer skis 41 of the skid 40
   shown in Figure 10 for use in the third/backfill mode 300.           In the backfill mode 300, a
 5 crossbeam 57 spaces a pair of open ended receptacles 63 apart from a center post 59 extending
   upward from the midpoint of the crossbeam 57. As seen in Figure 37, two posts 45 are seated,
   one in each of the receptacles 47 of the two outer skis 41 as shown in Figure 10. The posts 45
   extend up from their respective outer skis 41, pass through their respective open ended
   receptacles 63 in the crossbeam 57 and are pinned with the skis 41 at the desired distance below
tO the crossbeam 57. The crossbeam center post 59 is pinned in the chassis post receptacle 19 to
   set the desired height of the chassis 10 above the skis 41. The crossbeam 57 as shown has a
   front surface 61 configured to also serve as a spoil leveler in the backfill mode 300.
                                 Boulder Clearing Plow and Methods
           Looking at Figures 13-17, the boulder clearing plow 100 includes the chassis 10, the
L5 skid 40, the transition attachment 70 and the moldboards 90. The skid 40, in the configuration
   shown in Figure 10 with the head 51 is mounted on and supports the skid end 13 of the chassis
   10 above the seabed S. The moldboards 90 include primary, secondary and tertiary moldboards
   91, 93 and 95 mounted on the tool end 15 of the chassis 10. The transition attachment 70 is
   mounted under the chassis 10 between the skid 40 and the primary moldboards 91.
 o         As best seen in Figure 13, in the first/boulder clearing mode 100 the chassis 10 is
   oriented upside down in comparison to its orientation as shown in Figures 1 and 2. That is, in
   the boulder clearing plow 100, the skid end 13 is lower than the tool end 15 of the elongated
   member 11 and the skid post 45 extends upward through the receptacle 19 in the skid end 13 of
   the chassis 10.
25         As seen in Figures 13-17, the primary moldboards 91, which may be permanently or
   detachably mounted on the tool end 15 of the chassis 10, are angled outward and rearward from
   the tool end 15 of the chassis 10 and the transition attachment 70. The secondary moldboards
   93 are mounted below the primary moldboards 91 and the transition attachment 70 to increase
   the overall depth of the moldboards 91. The tertiary moldboards 95 are used when wider paths
30 are to be cleared of boulders B.      They are mounted at the free ends of the primary and
   secondary moldboards 91 and 93 and increase the length of the moldboards 90 for the full depth
   of the combined primary and secondary moldboards 91 and 93.
           As best seen in Figures 13-15, when the tertiary moldboards 95 are used, a chassis
   extension 33 is connected by its front flange 35 to the back flange plate 31 of the chassis 10. A

                                                    15
   supporting structure 37 of beams and struts connects the chassis extension 33 to the tertiary
   moldboards 95. Recovery fins 97 are appended to the free ends of the moldboards 90. The fins
   97 have divergingly arcute ends 99 for contact with the roller R during launch and recovery.
            The boulder clearing plow 100 may also include keel plates 110, shown in detail in
 5 Figure 18. The keel plates 110 have a vertical center plate 111 and horizontal base plates 113
   which extend laterally from the center plate 111. The base plates 113 and the center plates 111
   support a vertical mounting plate 115 at an angle complementary to the angle of the moldboards
   90. This structure is reinforced by small and large vertical support plates 117 and 119. At least
   one keel plate 110 mounted on the front of and extending under each set of moldboards 90. As
tO best seen in Figures 14, 15, 17 and 18, the keel plates 110 are mounted in parallel at the
   junctions of the secondary and tertiary moldboards 93 and 95. The primary function of the keel
   plates 110 is to steady the path of the boulder clearing plow 100 as the head 51 and moldboards
   90 encounter boulders B, spoil M and/or other obstacles on the seabed S.
            Turning to Figures 19-22 and 50, the over-the stern release (Figures 19-22) and retrieval
15 (Figures 22-19) of the boulder clearing plow 100 from a vessel V to the seabed S or from the
   seabed S onto a vessel V, respectively, are illustrated.       During release, the plow 100 is
   preferably and as shown initially positioned on the deck D with its moldboards 90 aft and the
   longitudinal axis 101 of the plow 100 aligned on the transition axis 103 of the plow 100. The
   skid 40 and keel plates 110 provide the initial contact points or surfaces of the plow 100 with
Zo the deck D. As seen in Figure 19, as the plow 100 is propelled, by winch or other suitable
   push/pull equipment (not shown), along the deck D of the vessel V toward and across the
   fulcrum/roller R at the stern of the vessel V, when the keel plates 110 have cleared the
   fulcrum/roller R, the plow 100 drops onto the moldboard 90 and slides on the moldboards to the
   concave surface of the transition attachment 70, at which point the moldboards slide to the
25 transition attachment 70 and the the skid 40 begins to rise from the deck D.          All contact
   between the plow 100 and the vessel V has transferred to the transition attachment 70 and the
   fulcrum/roller R of the vessel V. Looking at Figure 20, as the transition attachment 70 travels
   travel steward beyond the fulcrum/roller R, all contact between the plow 100 and the vessel V
   remains on the concave transition surface 79 of the attachment 70 and the fulcrum/roller R of
30 the vessel V and the plow 100 continues to tip toward the sea and the skid 40 continues to rise.
   As seen in Figure 21, as the attachment 70 travels further steward on the fulcrum/roller R, all
   contact between the plow 100 and the vessel V is still between the transition attachment 70 and
   the fulcrum/roller R but the skid 40 is nearly vertical. Looking at Figure 22, as the plow 100
   continues to rotate on and travel across the fulcrum/roller R, the buoyancy of the sea water and

                                                     16
   the travel speed of the vessel V limit rotation of the plow 100. As the transition attachment 70
   slides off the fulcrum/roller R, the skid 40 becomes the final contact with the fulcrum/roller R
   until the plow 100 is fully released at the end of a pulling line L to the seabed S.
            Retrieval of the boulder clearing plow 100 at the end of the pulling line L from the
 5 seabed S is accomplished by reversal of the release method. As seen in Figure 22, as the plow
   100 is raised at the end of the line L toward the fulcrum/roller R on the stern of the vessel V, the
   skid 40 will first contact the fulcrum/roller R. As noted above, the pulling points 65 of the plow
   110 are located so as to assure that the head 51 and skis 41 and 43 of the sled 40 will not hang
   up on the fulcrum/roller R. Further contact with the fulcrum/roller R transfers sequentially to
LO the transition surface 79 of the transition attachment 70 as seen in Figure 21, the concave
   portion of the attachment transition surface 79 as seen in Figure 20 and then along the bottom
   of the moldboards 90, as seen in Figure 19, until they contact the keel plates 110 and the plow
   100 has been pulled fully across the fulcrum/roller R and comes to rest with the skid 40 and
   keel plates 110 as the contact points on the deck D of the vessel V.
L5          Turning to Figure 23-25, the use of the boulder clearing plow 100 to clear boulders B
   from a path P on the seabed is illustrated. As seen in Figure 24, the plow 100 is positioned with
   the plow 100 bow-forward in the direction of an initial seabed path Pi which will be at the
   center of the intended final path P. The pattern of the final path P spirals out from the initial
   path P 1. The plow 100 is then propelled, perhaps at the end of the pulling line L, powered by a
zo winch or by the travel of the vessel, along the initial path P1 to clear boulders B from the initial
   path P1 to the port and starboard sides of the plow 100. After the initial path Pi is cleared,
   boulder clearing continues, if a wider path P is necessary, by repositioning the plow 100 bow
   forward, for travel in a direction opposite the initial seabed path direction, on a second seabed
   path P 2 along, as shown, the starboard side of the initial path P 1.        The plow 100 is then
25 propelled along the second path P 2 to clear boulders in the second path P 2 further away from the
   path P 1. After the second path P 2 is cleared, boulder clearing continues, if a wider path P is
   necessary, by repositioning the plow 100 bow-forward, for travel in the direction of the initial
   seabed path direction, on a third seabed path P 3 along the port side of the initial path P 1. The
   plow 100 is then propelled along the third path P 3 to clear boulders from the third path P 3
30 further away from the first path Pl. If a still wider path P is necessary, boulder clearing can
   further include repeating the widening along the path P resulting from the contiguity of the
   initial, second and third paths P1 , P 2 and P3 , as shown along paths P4 and P5 . The boulder
   clearing process anticipates repetition of the widening steps to widen successively contiguous
   paths Po, until a single path P of desired width has been cleared along the seabed.

                                                     17
           Looking at Figure 25, as the head 51 strikes one or more boulders B in its initial path Pi,
   the boulders B will be torqued out of the seabed and around the port or starboard side of the
   head 51, depending on which side of the head 51 strikes the boulders B.              The trailing
   moldboards 90 will torque and push the boulders B further to port or starboard away from the
 5 plow 100. On ensuing paths P 2 -,, only the outside of the head 51 and the outside moldboards 90
   are on a path to strike the boulders B, pushing them further away from the initial path P 1 . As
   seen in Figure 22, boulders B which have been pushed aside will be deposited in a small spoil
   heap H created aft of the plow 100 by the partial penetration of the seabed by the moldboards
   90.
10                                 Trench Cutting Plow and Methods
           Looking at Figures 26-29, the trench cutting plow 200 includes the chassis 10, the skid
   40, the moldboards 90 and the share 210. The skid 40, in the configuration shown in Figure 10,
   is mounted on and supports the skid end 13 of the chassis 10 above the seabed.                 The
   moldboards 90 initially include only the primary moldboards 91 mounted on the tool end 15 of
15 the chassis 10.   If more than one pass of a trench cutting plow 200 is to be performed, the
   secondary and tertiary moldboards 93 and 95 can be added.            Wedges (not shown) can be
   positioned between the chassis 10 and the moldboards 90 to angle the moldboards at a desired
   angle upward and rearward from the chassis 10 for second and subsequent passes of the plow.
   The transition attachment 70 is not used. As shown, the head 51 may optionally be attached to
zo the skid 40 in the first pass of the second/trench cutting mode 200.
           As best seen in Figure 20, in the second/trench cutting mode 200 the chassis 10 is
   oriented right-side up as shown in Figures 1 and 2. That is, in the trench cutting plow 200, the
   skid end 13 is higher than the tool end 15 of the elongated member 11 and the skid post 45
   extends upward through the receptacle 19 in the skid end 13 of the chassis 10.
25         The plow share 210 may be permanently or detachably mounted on the chassis 10. A
   preferred embodiment of the share 210 shown in Figures 26-32 includes a shoe box 211 joining
   the bottoms of center ribs 213 and side plates 215 which support the parting plates 217 of the
   share 210. A vertical plate 219 aligned with the shoe box 211 extends upwardly above the
   parting plates 217 and is inserted between the share connection plates 23 on the chassis 10. A
30 pin 221 inserted through a boss 223 on the vertical plate 219 and the connection plates 23
   secures the share 210 to the chassis 10.
           Turning to Figures 33-36, the over-the stern release (Figures 36-33) and retrieval
   (Figures 33-36) of the trench cutting plow 200 from the vessel V to the seabed S and from the
   seabed S onto the vessel V, respectively, are illustrated. During release, the plow 200 herein

                                                    18
   described is initially positioned upside down on the deck D with moldboards 90 aft and the
   longitudinal axis 201 of the plow 200 aligned on the plow's transition axis 203. The arcuate top
   49 of the skid post 45 and the free ends of the moldboards 90 provide the initial contact points
   or surfaces with the deck D. As seen in Figure 36, as the plow 200 is propelled, by winch or
 5 other suitable push/pull equipment (not shown), along the deck D of the vessel V toward and
   across the fulcrum/roller R at the stem of the vessel V, only the moldboards 90 and the arcuate
   top 49 of the post 45 will remain in contact with the fulcrum/roller R until the share connection
   plates 23 reach the fulcrum/roller R. As seen in Figure 35, as the plow 200 continues sternward
   travel, only the tops of the share connection plates 23 followed by the trailing top or transition
LO surface 27 of the transition member 25 and the arcuate top 49 of the post 45 will remain in
   contact with the fulcrum/roller R. As seen in Figure 34, as the center of gravity of the plow 200
   has passed the fulcrum/roller R, the cantilevered weight of the plow 200 causes the plow 200 to
   pivot on the transition surface 27 of the transition member 25, allowing the moldboards 90 to
   drop toward the seabed S and the skid post 45 to rise from the deck D. At this point in
15 transition, all contact between the plow 200 and the vessel V transfers to the angled portion 17
   of the chassis elongated member 11 and the fulcrum/roller R of the vessel V. Looking at Figure
   33, after the angled portion 17 of the chassis elongated member 11 has travelled steward
   beyond the fulcrum/roller R, the plow 200 will have rotated further toward the seabed S and all
   further contact between the plow 200 and the vessel V will have transferred to the arcuate top
zo 49 of the skid post 45 and the fulcrum/roller R of the vessel V. The arcuate top 49 of the skid
   post 45 provides the final contact with the fulcrum/roller R as the plow 200 is fully released at
   the end of a pulling line L to the seabed S.
            Retrieval of the trench cutting plow 200 at the end of the pulling line L from the seabed
   S is accomplished by reversal of the release method. As seen in Figure 33, as the plow 200 is
25 raised at the end of the line L toward the fulcrum/roller R on the stem of the vessel V, the
   arcuate top 49 of the skid post 45 will first contact the fulcrum/roller R. As noted above, the
   pulling points 65 of the plow 110 are located so as to assure that the post 45 will not hang up on
   the fulcrum/roller R. Further contact with the fulcrum/roller R transfers sequentially to the
   angled portion 17 of the chassis elongated member 11 as seen in Figure 34, to the transition
30 surface 27 as seen in Figure 35, and to the tops of the share connection plates 23 as seen in
   Figure 36. When the plow 200 has been pulled fully across the fulcrum/roller R, it will come
   to rest with the arcuate top 49 of the skid post 45 and the tops of the free ends of the
   moldboards 90 as the contact points on the deck D of the vessel V.
                                       Backfill Plow and Methods

                                                      19
            Turning to Figures 37-40, for backfilling spoil into a seabed trench, the backfill plow
   300 includes the chassis 10, the skid 40 configured to straddle the trench being backfilled, the
   moldboards 90 mounted on the chassis 10 forward of the skid 40 and the blade 310 mounted on
   and spanning the bottom edges of the moldboards 90.
 5          As best seen in Figure 37, in the third/backfill mode 300, the chassis 10 is oriented
   upside down in comparison to its orientation as shown in Figures 1 and 2.           That is, in the
   backfill plow 300, the skid end 13 is lower than the tool end 15 of the elongated member 11, as
   in the first/boulder clearing mode 100 shown in Figure 13, and the crossbeam center post 59
   extends upward through the receptacle 19 in the skid end 13 of the chassis 10, similar to the
LO post 45 in the first/boulder clearing mode 100 shown in Figure 13. However, the chassis 10 is
   oriented in reverse in comparison to the first/boulder clearing mode 100 shown in Figure 13, so
   that the skid 40 is at the trailing end of the backfill plow 300. In comparison to the first/boulder
   clearing mode 100, the skis 41 are also reversed in the third/boulder clearing mode 300 for
   forward travel in a trailing position.
L5          As seen in Figures 37-40, in the third/backfill mode, the moldboards 90, including the
   primary moldboards 91, the secondary moldboards 93 and the tertiary moldboards 95, are
   mounted on the chassis 10 in the same way as described in relation to the first/boulder clearing
   mode 100 of Figures 13-17 by use of the chassis extension 33 and supporting structure 37. The
   transition attachment 70 is also mounted to the chassis 10 in the same manner as described in
Zo relation to the first/boulder clearing mode 100 of Figures 13-17.        The recovery fins 97 are
   appended to the free ends of the tertiary moldboards 95 as described in relation to the
   first/boulder clearing mode 100 of Figures 13-17.
            Looking at Figure 41, the blade 310 has a passage 311 at its rear apex 313. The passage
   311 is configured to dispense the spoil collected by the blade 310 and funneled by the
25 moldboards 90 onto the top of a pipe or cable C disposed in the trench T below the passage 311.
   The side edges of the blade 310 are secured to the lower portions of their respective moldboards
   90 by use of side plates 315 and to the chassis extension 33 by use of an upright mounting
   structure 317. The mounting structure 317 is centered on the leading edge 319 of the blade 310
   and, as shown, extends from the blade edge 319 to the passage 311.         The blade 310 may be
30 stiffened by ribs 321. As shown, the passage 311 is slightly greater than semi-circular with a
   diameter 323 parallel to the blade leading edge 319. The stiffening ribs 321 fan out from points
   along the passage circumference 325 to respective points along the blade leading edge 319.
            Looking at Figure 42, the backfill plow 300 preferably further includes a flapper board
   340 aft of the passage 311. The flapper board 340 includes a plate 341 fixed to and swinging

                                                   20
   below a horizontal shaft 343. The shaft 343 is journalled to reciprocate on an axis parallel to
   the passage diameter 323. A weight 345 biases the plate 341 toward a vertical orientation. The
   slapping action of the flapper board 340 fragments spoil discharged through the blade passage
   311. Large and small stiffeners 347 and 349 reinforce the plate 341. The reciprocating swing
 5 of the plate 341 on its shaft 343 is caused as water and spoil discharging through the passage
   311 swings the plate 341 toward the rear and the weight 345 causes the plate 341 to swing back
   toward vertical.
            The backfill plow 300 may also include keel plates 370, at least one keel plate 370
   extending on opposite sides of the spoil passage 311. The keel plates 110, shown in Figure 18
LO for use in the first/boulder clearing mode 100, can be used in the third/backfill mode 300 except
   that, in the backfill mode 300, they are mounted on the front of the moldboards 90 and extend
   under the blade 310. As seen in Figures 38-40, the keel plates 370 are mounted in parallel at
   the junctions of the secondary and tertiary moldboards 93 and 95. The primary function of the
   keel plates 370 is to steady the path of the backfill plow 300 as the blade 310 and moldboards
L5 90 encounter and collect spoil M on the seabed S.
            Turning to Figures 43-46, the over-the stern release (Figures 46-43) and retrieval
   (Figures 43-46) of the backfill plow 300 from a vessel V to the seabed S or from the seabed S
   onto a vessel V, respectively, are illustrated. During release, the plow 300 described herein is
   initially positioned on the deck D with moldboards 90 aft and the longitudinal axis 301 of the
Zo plow 300 aligned on the transition axis 303 of the plow 300. The skid 40 and bottoms of the
   keel plates 370 provide the initial contact points with the deck D. As seen in Figure 46, as the
   plow 300 is propelled, by winch or other suitable push/pull equipment (not shown), along the
   deck D of the vessel V toward and across the fulcrum/roller R at the stern of the vessel V, the
   keel plates 370 clear the fulcrum/roller R, allowing the moldboards 90 to drop toward the
25 seabed S. The plow begins to pivot on the transition surface 79 and the skid 40 begins to rise
   from the deck D. At this point in transition, all contact between the plow 300 and the vessel V
   has transferred to the transition attachment 70 and the fulcrum/roller R of the vessel V.
   Looking at Figure 45, as the plow 300 travels further sternward across the fulcrum/roller R, all
   contact between the plow 300 and the vessel V has transferred to the concave portion of the
30 transition surface 79 of the attachment 70 and the fulcrum/roller R of the vessel V. As seen in
   Figure 44, as the attachment 70 has travelled steward beyond the fulcrum/roller R, all contact
   between the plow 300 and the vessel V remains on the angled portion 17 of the chassis
   elongated member 11 and the fulcrum/roller R of the vessel V. The plow 300 has tipped so that
   the skid 40 nears vertical. Looking at Figure 43, as the plow 300 continues to rotate on and

                                                    21
   travel across the fulcrum/roller R, the buoyancy of the sea water and the travel speed of the
   vessel V limit rotation of the plow 300 as the transition attachment 70 slides off the
   fulcrum/roller R. The shape of the attachment 70 affords a smooth transition from the transition
   surface 79 to the skid 40. The skid 40 becomes the final contact with the fulcrum/roller R until
 5 the plow 100 is fully released at the end of a pulling line L to the seabed S.
           Retrieval of the backfill plow 300 at the end of the pulling line L from the seabed S is
   accomplished by reversal of the release method. As seen in Figure 43, as the plow 300 is raised
   at the end of the line L toward the fulcrum/roller R on the stem of the vessel V, the skid 40 will
   first contact the fulcrum/roller R. As noted above, the pulling points 65 of the plow 300 are
LO located so as to assure that the head 51 and skis 41 and 43 of the sled 40 will not hang up on the
   fulcrum/roller R. Further contact with the fulcrum/roller R transfers sequentially to the angled
   portion 17 of the chassis elongated member 11 as seen in Figure 44, to the attachment transition
   surface 79 as seen in Figure 45 and to the bottom of the keel plates 370 as seen in Figure 46.
   When the plow 300 has been pulled fully across the fulcrum/roller R, it will come to rest with
L5 the skid 40 and keel plates 370 as the contact points on the deck D of the vessel V.
           Turning to Figures 47 and 48, in backfilling spoil M to cover a pipe P laid in a seabed
   trench T, the backfill plow 300, with the blade 310 forward, is propelled to travel on the seabed
   S and collect spoil M along the sides of the trench T. The moldboards 90 funnel the collected
   spoil M toward the rear apex 313 of the blade 310 and the funneled spoil M is discharged
zo through the passage 311 in the blade apex 313 and onto the top surface of the pipe P disposed in
   the trench T. Preferably, the discharged spoil M is fragmented, as shown by the flapper board
   340, before the discharged spoil M reaches the pipe P and the spoil M discharged onto the pipe
   P and into the trench T is leveled by the front surface 61 of the skid crossbar 57. The use of the
   passage 311 to discharge the spoil M directly onto, rather than to the sides of, the pipe P
25 reduces the likelihood that the more dense spoil M will lift the pipe P in the trench T during
   backfilling.
           Turning to Figure 49, for trenches wider than the widest span of the moldboards 90, the
   boulder clearing plow 100 seen in Figure 13 can be used to narrow the width of the trench T.
   This is accomplished by aligning the longitudinal axis 101 of the plow 100 outside of the spoil
30 M one side of the trench T, as shown with only the starboard moldboards 90 pushing the spoil
   M. On the first pass Pa the spoil M in the path of the starboard moldboards will be pushed
   toward or into the trench T. When the first pass Pa is completed, the plow 100 is aligned on the
   other side of the trench T, as shown again with only the starboard moldboards 90 pushing the
   spoil M. On the second pass Pb, the spoil M in the path of the starboard moldboards will be

                                                     22
   pushed toward or into the trench T. When the second pass Pb is completed, the process can be
   repeated for passes Po, until the trench T is filled or until the trench T is sufficiently filled to
   complete backfilling using the backfill plow 300.
            Turning to Figure 50, the plows 100, 200 or 300 can be retrieved by use of the tow line
 5 L connected to the retrieval fins 97. Depending on which of the plows 100, 200 or 300 is
   retrieved, the orientation of the plow 100, 200 or 300 can be rotated 180' about the axis of the
   tow line L to a suitable retrieval position. In either 1800 orientation, the arcuate ends 99 of the
   fins 97 will enable the plow 100, 200 or 300 to pass over the fulcrum/roller R.
            The plows 100, 200 and 300 are made using steel plates which are welded, bolted or
10 pinned, depending on the intended permanency or detachability of the components being
   connected. The same chassis 10, skids 40, transition attachment 70, moldboards 90, and keel
   plates 110 can be configured into three different modes of operation and the share 210 and
   blade 310 added as needed for their respective modes. The need for a large vessel, cranes and
   supporting equipment is eliminated since the plow modes 100, 200 and 300 are all capable of
15 over-the-stern launch and recovery.
            While the convention apparatus and methods have been described in relation to laying
   pipe, it is also applicable to laying cable. Furthermore, all of the plows 100, 200 and 300 can
   be adapted for use with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) which can "dock" on the plow to
   provide additional mechanical functionality such as skid height adjustment or electrical
zo functionality such as cameras, lights, and load measurement.
            Thus, it is apparent that there has been provided, in accordance with the invention, a
   multi-mode seabed plow and plow release, operation and retrieval methods that fully satisfy the
   objects, aims and advantages set forth above.         While the invention has been described in
   conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives,
25 modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing
   description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and
   variations as fall within the spirit of the appended claims.
            The term 'comprise' and variants of the term such as 'comprises' or 'comprising' are
   used herein to denote the inclusion of a stated integer or stated integers but not to exclude any
30 other integer or any other integers, unless in the context or usage an exclusive interpretation of
   the term is required.
            Any reference to publications cited in this specification is not an admission that the
   disclosures constitute common general knowledge in Australia.
