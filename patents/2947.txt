                   COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR INCREASING
                                 FRACTURE CONDUCTIVITY
                                RELATED APPLICATION DATA
[0001] This application is a divisional application of Australian Application No. 2014295310,
the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Most of the disclosure of that
application is included herein. However, reference may be made to the specification of that
application as filed to gain further understanding of the invention claimed herein.
                                         BACKGROUND
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the
present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.
[0003] Fracturing is used to increase permeability of subterranean formations. A fracturing
fluid is injected into the wellbore passing through the subterranean formation. A propping
agent (proppant) is injected into the fracture to prevent fracture closing and, thereby, to
provide improved extraction of extractive fluids, such as oil, gas or water.
[0004] The proppant maintains the distance between the fracture walls in order to create
conductive channels in the formation. Settling of proppant particles, however, can decrease
the conductivity in the fracture.
                                            SUMMARY

        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SOME ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS
[0022] For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the disclosure,
reference will now be made to some illustrative embodiments of the current application.

[0023] Some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter may be described in terms of
treatment of vertical wells, but are equally applicable to wells of any orientation.
Embodiments may be described for hydrocarbon production wells, but it is to be understood
that embodiments may be used for wells for production of other fluids, such as water or
carbon dioxide, or, for example, for injection or storage wells. It should also be understood
that throughout this specification, when a concentration or amount range is described as
being useful, or suitable, or the like, it is intended that any and every concentration or
amount within the range, including the end points, is to be considered as having been
stated.   Furthermore, each numerical value should be read once as modified by the term
"about" (unless already expressly so modified) and then read again as not to be so modified
unless otherwise stated in context. For example, "a range of from 1 to 10" is to be read as
indicating each and every possible number along the continuum between about 1 and about
10. In other words, when a certain range is expressed, even if only a few specific data
points are explicitly identified or referred to within the range, or even when no data points
are referred to within the range, it is to be understood that the inventors appreciate and
understand that any and all data points within the range are to be considered to have been
specified, and that the inventors have possession of the entire range and all points within
the range.     It should also be understood that fracture closure includes partial fracture
closure.
[0024] As used herein, the term hydraulic fracturing treatment means the process of
pumping fluid into a wellbore with powerful hydraulic pumps to create enough downhole
pressure to crack or fracture the formation. This allows injection of proppant-laden fluid into
the formation, thereby creating a region of high-permeability sand through which fluids can
flow. The proppant remains in place once the hydraulic pressure is removed and therefore
propants open the fracture and enhances flow into or from the wellbore.
[0025] As used herein, the term void means any open space in a geological formation,
including naturally occurring open spaces and open spaces formed between the geological
formation and one or more objects placed into the geological formation. A void may be a
fracture. In certain embodiments, the void may be a fracture with a narrowest dimension of
the fracture being from 1 micron to 20 mm. All values and subranges from 1 micron to 20
mm are included and disclosed herein; for example, the narrowest dimension of the fracture
may be from a lower limit of 1 micron, 300 microns, 600 microns, 900 microns, 10 mm or 15
mm to an upper limit of 15 microns, 500 microns, 800 microns, 2 mm, 12 mm, or 20 mm.
For example, the narrowest dimension of the fracture may be from 1 micron to 20mm, or
from 1 micron to 1 mm, from 1 mm to 20 mm, or from 1 mm to 10 mm, or from 10 mm to 20
mm.
[0026] The terms solid particulate includes, for example, proppants.
[0027] Embodiments of the disclosed subject matter enable increasing conductivity of a
solid particulate, or proppant, pack in a void by forming highly conductive channels by

means of proppant settling in the presence of an agglomerant. Formation of such channels
is accomplished by redistributing proppant in a fracturing fluid during agglomerant-assisted
non-homogeneous settling.         Such non-homogeneous settling causes the formation of
"islands" of proppant-rich clusters surrounded by substantially proppant-free fluid.       Void
closure results in creation of channels between the proppant clusters. When such channels
interconnect, the void has significantly higher conductivity than the conductivity of a void
treated with a treatment slurry which exhibits homogeneous proppant settling.
[0028] Treatment slurries may be laboratory tested using artificial voids created between
two plates having a space therebetween. The simulated fracture width may be from 3 to 6
mm and the plates may range from 15.2 cm to 20.3 cm (6 by 8 inches) to 101.6 cm by 101.6
cm (40 by 40 inches). As would be understood, other sizes of plates could be used. The
plates may be made from a transparent material, such as acrylic glass, so that the settling
and distribution of the treatment slurry may be observed over time. Channelization herein is
measured qualitatively using an index from 0 to 3.         The numeral 0 indicates that the
treatment slurry exhibits no settling and no channelization; 1 indicates settling without
channelization; 2 indicates some channelization but wherein the solids-free regions are not
interconnected;     and 3 indicates channelization wherein the solids-free regions are
interconnected. Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the channelization indexes 0-3.
[0029] Channelization index 0 corresponds to the scenario wherein the treatment slurry
inside the void (e.g. hydraulic fracture) is homogeneous and no separation or settling of the
solid particulates takes place.
[0030] Channelization index 1 corresponds to the scenario wherein the solid particulates
(cross hatched areas) in the treatment slurry inside the void (e.g. hydraulic fracture) are
settling homogeneously with no noticeable separation between components.
[0031] Channelization index 2 corresponds to the scenario wherein the treatment slurry
inside the void (e.g. hydraulic fracture) is separating forming areas which consists
substantially of the particulate solids (cross hatched area) and areas substantially or entirely
free of solids (solid shaded areas) and wherein the solids free areas are not interconnected.
[0032] Channelization index 3 corresponds to the scenario wherein the treatment slurry
inside the     void   (e.g. hydraulic   fracture)  has  separated   forming  solid-rich   areas
(crosshatched areas) and interconnected solids-free areas (solid shaded areas).         In such
scenario, there is at least one solids-free fluidly connected path between the sides of the
void.
[0033] In some embodiments, methods for treating a subterranean formation penetrated by
a wellbore are disclosed; such methods comprising providing a treatment slurry comprising
a carrier fluid, a solid particulate and an agglomerant; injecting the treatment slurry into a
fracture to form a substantially uniformly distributed mixture of the solid particulate and
injecting the agglomerant; and transforming the substantially uniform mixture into areas that

are rich in solid particulate and areas that are substantially free of solid particulate, wherein
the solid particulate and the agglomerant have substantially dissimilar settling, i.e. flow or
velocities in the fracture and wherein said transforming results from said substantially
dissimilar velocities. Such dissimilar velocities may, in some embodiments, arise, partially
or wholly, from the interaction of the agglomerant with the fracture wall, such interaction
including for example, those arising by friction.        As used herein, substantially dissimilar
means differing by at least 20%. All values and subranges from at least 20% are included
herein and disclosed herein.          For example, the sedimentation rates of particulate and
agglomerant may differ by at least 20%, or differ by at least 50%, differ by at least 75%, or
differ by at least 100%, or differ by at least 150%.
[0034] In further embodiments, compositions are disclosed, said compoistions comprising:
a carrier fluid; a plurality of solid particulates; and an agglomerant; wherein the composition
is   capable of transforming         via  settling from   a first state    of being  substantially
homogeneously mixed and a second state comprising portions that are rich in the solid
particulates and portions that are substantially free of the solid particulates.            Such
transformation may, in some embodiments, arise, partially or wholly, from differing settling
rates of agglomerant and solid particulates.          Such differing settling rates may, in some
embodiments, arise partially or wholly from the interaction of the agglomerant with the
fracture wall, such interaction including for example, those arising by friction.
[0035] Further embodiments disclose methods comprising: providing a slurry comprising a
carrier fluid, a solid particulate and an agglomerant; flowing the slurry into a void to form a
substantially uniformly distributed mixture of the solid particulate and the agglomerant; and
transforming the substantially uniformly distributed mixture into areas that are rich in solid
particulate and areas that are substantially free of solid particulate, wherein the solid
particulate and the agglomerant have substantially dissimilar settling, or flow, velocities in
the void and wherein said transforming results from said substantially dissimilar velocities.
Such dissimilar velocities may, in some embodiments, arise, partially or wholly, from the
interaction of the agglomerant with the fracture wall, such interaction including for example,
those arising by friction.
[0036] Further embodiments disclose methods of designing a treatment, comprising:
considering a fracture dimension; selecting an agglomerant having a dimension comparable
to the fracture dimension; selecting a solid particulate having a substantially different settling
velocity from the agglomerant; formulating a treatment fluid comprising the solid particulate
and the agglomerant such that the treatment fluid is capable of transforming via settling
from a first state of being substantially homogeneously mixed and a second state
comprising portions that are rich of the solid particulates and portions that are substantially
free of the solid particulates; and pumping the treatment fluid into a well to create and/or
enlarge the fracture.

[0037] As used herein, substantially free of a component means having less than 40% such
component.      All individual values and subranges of less than 40% are included and
disclosed herein. For example, substantially free of such component may be less than 40%
such component, or less than 20% such component, or less than 10% such component, or
less than 5% such component, or less than 2.5% such component, or less than 1.25% such
component, or less than 0.625% such component.
[0038] As used herein, rich in a component means having greater than 40% such
component.     All individual values and subranges of greater than 40% are included and
disclosed herein.    For example, rich in such component may be greater than 40% such
component, or greater than 60% such component, or greater than 90% such component, or
greater than 95% such component, or greater than 97% such component, or greater than
98% such component.
[0039] In an alternative, all embodiments disclosed may contain a treatment fluid that, at
the time     of injecting,  possesses a     property   inconsistent with    channelization and
subsequently is transformed to be consistent with channelization.             For example, the
treatment slurry may have a viscosity, at the time of injecting, such that it enables the
placement of solid particulates into a void, e.g. greater than 50 cP at 100s-1 and at the same
time a viscosity such that it minimizes the chance of channelization via settling, e.g. greater
than 500,000 cP at 0.001 to 1s-1 . Subsequently, the viscosity may be changed, e.g., by
introduction of a viscosity breaker such that the viscosity is consistent with channelization.
In yet a further embodiment, the treatment slurry may contain a combination of two or more
fluids, for example a crosslinked gel and a linear gel, wherein, at the time of injecting, at
least one of the fluids is inconsistent with channelization and at least one of the fluids is
consistent with channelization.    In such embodiments, subsequent to the injecting, those
fluids inconsistent with channelization may be destroyed or broken thereby allowing
channelization to occur. Examples of such systems may be solutions of crosslinked guar
and viscoelastic surfactants wherein de-crosslinking may occur by lowering the pH or by
addition of oxidative breakers. Another example may be solutions of crosslinked guar with
borate and polyacrylamide polymers.
[0040] Carrying fluids suitable for use in all embodiments of the disclosed subject matter
include any fluid useful in fracturing fluids, including, without limitation, gels, foams,
slickwater, energized fluids, and viscoelastic surfactants.       In further embodiments, the
carrying fluids may comprise linear fluids, e.g. non-crosslinked fluids.
[0041] In an alternative, all embodiments disclosed may contain a carrying fluid comprising
a crosslinked fluid such as a crosslinked polysaccharide and/or crosslinked polyacrilamide.
Any appropriate cross linking agent may be used in forming the crosslinked fluid, including,
for example, boron and its salts, salts or other compounds of transition metals such as

chromium and copper, titanium, antimony, aluminum, zirconium, and organic crosslinkers,
such as glutaraldehyde.
[0042] In an alternative, all embodiments disclosed may contain a carrying fluid being a
viscoelastic surfactant (VES) or emulsion. In further embodiments, the slurry or composition
further comprises one or more breaker additives for reducing the viscosity of the liquid
phase.
[0043] In further embodiments, the solid particulates have an aspect ratio (the ratio of the
largest dimension to the smallest dimension) of less than or equal to 6.            All values and
subranges from less than or equal to 6 are included herein and disclosed herein.               For
example, the solid particulate aspect ratio may be less than or equal to 6, or less than or
equal to 5.5, or less than or equal to 5.
[0044] In further embodiments, the solid particulates have density from 0.1g/cm3 to
10g/cm3 . All values and subranges from 0.1g/cm3 to 10g/cm3 are included herein and
disclosed herein.     For example, the solid particulate density may be from a lower value of
0.1, 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 g/cm 3 to an upper value of 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 g/cm 3. For example, the solid
particulate density may be from 1 g/cm 3 to 5g/cm 3, or from 2g/cm 3 to 4g/cm 3 .
[0045] In further embodiments, the density of the solid particulate is more than the density
of the carrier fluid.
[0046] In further embodiments, the agglomerant is selected from the group of solid particles
having an aspect ratio greater than 6.        All values and subranges from greater than 6 or
disclosed and included herein. For example, the agglomerant may have an aspect ratio of
greater than 6, or greater than or equal to 20, or greater than or equal to 40, or greater than
or equal to 50.
[0047] In further embodiments, the agglomerant has a density between 0.lg/cm 3 to
lOg/cm 3. All values and subranges from 0.lg/cm 3 to 1Og/cm            3
                                                                         are included herein and
disclosed herein. For example, the agglomerant density may be from a lower value of 0.1,
1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 g/cm3 to an upper value of 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 g/cm 3 .           For example, the
                                            3          3                 3
agglomerant density may be from 1g/cm to 5g/cm , or from 2g/cm to 4g/cm 3.
[0048] In further embodiments, the density of the agglomerant is less than the density of the
carrier fluid.
[0049] The solid particulates and agglomerant may have any size or size distribution in the
range from 10 nm to 5 mm. All values and subranges from 10 nm to 5 mm are included and
disclosed herein. For example, the solid particulates and/or agglomerant may have a size
from 10 nm to 5 mm, or from 0.1 mm to 2 mm, or from 0.1 mm to 5 mm, or from 10 nm to
0.001 mm, or from 0.001 mm to 5 mm, or from 0.0005 mm to 5 mm, or from 1000 nm to 1
mm.

[0050] The solid particulates and agglomerant may have any shape provided the aspect
ratio requirements are met, including fibers, tubes, irregular beads,          flakes, ribbons,
platelets, rods, tubes or any combination of two or more thereof.
[0051] Any proppant material meeting the aspect ratio of less than or equal to 6 and useful
in well treatment fluids may be used. Exemplary proppants include ceramic proppant, sand,
bauxite, glass beads, crushed nuts shells, polymeric proppant, and mixtures thereof.
[0052] In further embodiments, the solid particulates have an average particle size from 1
micron to 5000 microns.       All values and subranges from 1 to 5000 microns are included
and disclosed herein; for example, the solid particulate has an average particle size from a
lower limit of 1, 300, 900, 2000, 2400, 3300 or 4800 microns to an upper limit of 200, 700,
 1500, 2200, 2700, 3500 or 5000 microns.         For example, the solid particulates have an
average particle size from 1 to 5000 microns, or from 1 to 2500 microns, or from 2500 to
5000 microns, or from 1 micron to 1 mm, or from 10 microns to 800 microns.             As used
herein, the term average particle size refers to the average size of the largest dimension of
the solid particulate.
[0053] In further embodiments, the largest dimension of the agglomerant particles is
comparable to the narrowest dimension of the void, or fracture.               As used herein,
comparable means not differing by more than 20 fold. For example, the solid particulates
and/or agglomerant may have a size from 0.05 to 20 fold of the narrowest dimension of the
void (e.g. fracture width), or from 0.1 to 10 fold of the narrowest dimension of the void (e.g.
fracture width), or from 0.33 to 3 fold of the narrowest dimension of the void (e.g. fracture
width).     The largest dimension of the agglomerant may also be comparable to the
narrowest dimension of the void, or fracture.          For example, if the fracture narrowest
dimension, i.e. width, is 2 mm, the average largest dimension of the agglomerants may be
between 0.1 and 40 mm. In various embodiments, expected void widths range from micron
to 20 mm. All individual values and subranges from micron to 20 mm are disclosed and
included herein.
[0054] In further embodiments, the largest dimension of the agglomerant is from 0.5 micron
to 50 mm.       All values and subranges from 0.5 microns to 50 mm; for example, the
agglomerant largest dimension may be from a lower limit of 0.5 microns, 100 microns, 500
microns, 900 microns, 20 mm or 40 mm to an upper limit of 10 microns, 250 microns, 750
microns, 10 mm, 30 mm or 50 mm.          For example, the agglomerant largest dimension may
be from 0.5 micron to 50 mm, or from 1mm to 20 mm, or from 0.5 microns to 20 mm, or
from 20 to 50 mm, or from 0.5 microns to 30 mm.
[0055] In further embodiments, the solid particulates comprise a mixture or blend of two or
more particulate solids.     For example, the solid particulates may comprise a first solid
particulate type having a first average particle size, a second solid particulate type having a
second average particle size, a third solid particulate type having a third average particle

size, and so on. Alternatively, the two or more solid particulate types may have different
densities, shapes, aspect ratios, structures, compositions and/or chemical properties.
[0056] In further embodiments, some or all of the solid particulates and/or agglomerant are
made of degradable, meltable, soluble or dissolvable materials. In another embodiment, the
treatment slurry further comprises one or more agent(s) that accelerate or control
degradation of degradable solid particulates. For example, NaOH, CaCO3 and Ca(OH) 2
may be added to the treatment slurry to control degradation of particulate materials
comprising polylactic acid.      Likewise, an acid may be used to accelerate degradation for
particulate materials comprising polysaccharides and polyamides.
[0057] In   further embodiments,       the  solid particulates and/or agglomerant comprise
polymeric fibers. Any suitable polymeric fibers may be used, including for example, fibers
comprising       polyester,      polylactic   acid    (PLA),      polyglycolic     acid      (PGA),
polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), polycaprolactam, polyamides copolymers, cellulose, wool,
basalt, glass, rubber, sticky fibers, and mixtures thereof.
[0058] In further embodiments, the solid particulates may be a proppant. Any proppant
material may be used, including, for example, sand, glass beads, ceramic proppants,
polymeric beads, or hollow glass spheres, and combinations thereof.
[0059] In further embodiments, the velocities are settling velocities.
[0060] In further embodiments, the transforming the substantially uniform mixture into areas
that are rich in solid particulate and areas that are substantially free of solid particulate takes
place during a forced fracture closure or during post-job well flowback.
[0061] In further embodiments, the solid particulates and the agglomerant have different
shapes, sizes, densities or a combination thereof.
[0062] In further embodiments, the agglomerant is a fiber, a flake, a ribbon, a platelet, a
rod, or a combination thereof.
[0063] In further embodiments, the agglomerant is a fiber.
[0064] In further embodiments, the agglomerant is a degradable material.
[0065] In further embodiments, some or all of the solid particulates and/or agglomerant are
made of degradable, meltable, soluble or dissolvable materials.
[0066] In further embodiments, the agglomerant is selected from the group consisting of
polylactic acid, polyester, polycaprolactam, polyamide, polyglycolic acid, polyterephthalate,
cellulose, wool, basalt, glass, rubber, or a combination thereof.
[0067] In further embodiments, some or all of the solid particulates and/or agglomerant
comprise degradable, meltable, soluble or dissolvable materials.

[0068] In further embodiments, the transforming is achieved by allowing the substantially
uniformly dispersed solid particulate (and agglomerant) to settle in the fracture for a period
of time.
[0069] In further embodiments, the injecting is achieved by pumping the treatment slurry
under a pressure sufficient to create the fracture or maintain the fracture open in the
subterranean formation.
[0070] In further embodiments, the transforming is achieved before flow back of the
treatment fluid.
[0071] In further embodiments, the transforming is achieved before fracture closure.
[0072] In further embodiments, the substantially uniformly distributed mixture is formed in at
least a portion of the void, or fracture.
[0073] In further embodiments, the transforming of the substantially uniform mixture into
areas that are rich in solid particulate and areas that are substantially free of solid
particulate happens in at least a portion of the void (e.g. fracture).
[0074] In further embodiments, the agglomerant has a substantially dissimilar settling
characteristic from that of the solid particulate.     Without being bound by any particular
theory, it is currently believed that the dissimilar settling characteristics may arise from one
or more of the following: differences in shape, density or size, and interactions between the
void walls and the agglomerant and/or solid particulate, and combinations thereof.
[0075] In further embodiments, the solid particulates are present in the slurry in an amount
of less than 22 vol%. All values and subranges of less than 22 vol% are included and
disclosed herein.     For example the solid particulate may be present in an amount of 22
vol%, or less than 18 vol%, or less than 15 vol%, or less than 12 vol%.
[0076] In further embodiments, the agglomerant is present in the treatment slurry in an
amount of less than 5 vol%. All individual values and subranges from less than 5 vol% are
included and disclosed herein.        For example, the amount of agglomerant may be from
0.05vol% less than 5 vol%, or less than 1 vol%, or less than 0.5 vol%. The agglomerant
may be present in an amount from 0.5 vol% to 1.5 vol%, or in an amount from 0.01 vol% to
0.5 vol%, or in an amount from 0.05vol% to 0.5vol%.
[0077] In further embodiments, the agglomerant is a fiber with a length from 1 to 50 mm, or
more specifically from 1 to 10mm, and a diameter of from 1 to 50 microns, or, more
specifically from 1 to 20microns. All values and subranges from 1 to 50 mm are included
and disclosed herein. For example, the fiber agglomerant length may be from a lower limit
of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 19, 29 or 49 mm to an upper limit of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 30 or 50 mm. The
fiber agglomerant length may range from 1 to 50 mm, or from 1 to 10 mm, or from 1 to 7
mm, or from 3 to 10 mm, or from 2 to 8 mm. All values from 1 to 50 microns are included
and disclosed herein.     For example, the fiber agglomerant diameter may be from a lower

limit of 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 30, 40, or 49 microns to an upper limit of 2, 6, 10, 14, 17, 22. 32,
42 or 50 microns. The fiber agglomerant diameter may range from 1 to 50 microns, or from
 10 to 50 microns, or from 1 to 15 microns, or from 2 to 17 microns.
[0078] In further embodiments, the agglomerant is selected from the group consisting of
polylactic acid, polyester, polycaprolactam, polyamide, polyglycolic acid, polyterephthalate,
cellulose, wool, basalt, glass, rubber, or a combination thereof.
[0079] In further embodiments, the agglomerant is a fiber with a length from 0.001 to 1 mm
and a diameter of from 50 nanometers (nm) to 10 microns. All individual values from 0.001
to 1 mm are disclosed and included herein. For example, the agglomerant fiber length may
be from a lower limit of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 or 0.9 mm to an upper limit of 0.009, 0.07, 0.5 or 1
mm.     All individual values from 50 nanometers to 10 microns are included and disclosed
herein. For example, the fiber agglomerant diameter may range from a lower limit of 50, 60,
70, 80, 90, 100, or 500 nanometers to an upper limit of 500 nanometers, 1 micron, or 10
microns.
[0080] In further embodiments, the solid particulate has particles with size from 0.001 to 1
mm. All individual values from 0.001 to 1 mm are disclosed and included herein.                For
example, the solid particulate size may be from a lower limit of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 or 0.9 mm to
an upper limit of 0.009, 0.07, 0.5 or 1 mm. Here particle size is defined is the largest
dimension of the grain of said particle.
[0081] In further embodiments, the agglomerant is a fiber with a length of from 0.5 to 5
times the width (i.e. smallest dimension) of a subterranean void to be treated with the
treatment slurry. In various embodiments, expected void widths range from micron to 20
mm.      All individual values and subranges from micron to 20 mm are disclosed and
included herein.
[0082] In further embodiments, the viscosity of the carrying fluid is from 1 Pa-s to 500 Pa-s
in the range of shear rates from 0.001 to 1 s-1 when transforming the composition from the
first to the second state. All individual values and subranges from 1 Pa-s to 500 Pa-s in the
range of shear rates from 0.001 to 1 s-1 are included and disclosed herein. For example,
the viscosity of the carrying fluid may range from a lower limit of 1, 75, 150, 225, 300, 375,
or 425 Pa-s to an upper limit of 50, 125, 200, 275, 325, 400, 475 or 500 Pa-s, all in the
range of shear rates from 0.001 to 1 s-1 For example, the viscosity of the carrying fluid
during transforming may range from 1 to 500 Pa-s, or from 250 to 500 Pa-s, or from 1 to
250 Pa-s, or from 200 to 400 Pa-s, all in the range of shear rates from 0.001 to 1 s-1
[0083] In further embodiments, the carrying fluid exhibits Newtonian or non-Newtonian
(e.g., Herschel-Bulkley, Bingham, power law) flow.
[0084] In further embodiments, the viscosity of carrying fluid is impacted by temperature.

[0085] In further embodiments, the viscosity of the carrying fluid during injection into a void
may be different from the viscosity of the carrying fluid following placement into the void.
[0086] In further embodiments, the amount of solid particulates and agglomerant is
designed to prevent bridging and screenout. Such designing may include modeling using
geotechnical model which would define expected fracture geometry (width) and flow
conditions on the fracture during the treatment so as to determine the solid particulate and
agglomerant amounts to prevent bridging and to allow heterogeneous channelization. See
e.g., examples 2 and 3 below.
[0087] In further embodiments, the yield stress of the carrying fluid is less than 5 Pa-s in the
range of shear rates from 0.001 to 1 s-1 when transforming the composition from the first to
the second state. All individual values and subranges of less than 5 Pa s in the range of
shear rates from 0.001 to 1 s-'are included and disclosed herein.        For example, the yield
stress of the carrying fluid when transforming the composition from the first to the second
state may be less than 5 Pa-s, or less than 3 Pa-s, or less than 1 Pa-s, all in the range of
shear rates from 0.001 to 1 s-1.
[0088] Although the preceding description has been described herein with reference to
particular means, materials and embodiments, it is not intended to be limited to the
particulars disclosed herein; rather, it extends to all functionally equivalent structures,
methods and uses, such as are within the scope of the appended claims.
EXAMPLES
[0089] Any element in the examples may be replaced by any one of numerous equivalent
alternatives, only some of which are disclosed in the specification. Although only a few
example embodiments have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will
readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the example embodiments
without materially departing from the concepts described herein.         The disclosed subject
matter may be embodied in other forms without departing from the spirit and the essential
attributes thereof, and, accordingly, reference should be made to the appended claims,
rather than to the foregoing specification, as indicating the scope of the disclosed subject
matter. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of
this disclosure as defined in the following claims.         In the claims, means-plus-function
clauses are intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited
function and not only structural equivalents, but also equivalent structures. Thus, although
a nail and a screw may not be structural equivalents in that a nail employs a cylindrical
surface to secure wooden parts together, whereas a screw employs a helical surface, in the
environment of fastening wooden parts, a nail and a screw may be equivalent structures. It
is the express intention of the applicant not to invoke 35 U.S.C.    § 112, paragraph 6 for any

limitations of any of the claims herein, except for those in which the claim expressly uses
the words 'means for' together with an associated function.
Example 1 and Comparative Example 1:              Formation of proppant-rich clusters and
proppant-free channels by enabling heterogeneous proppant settling in the presence
of fiber.
[0090] Comparative Example 1 was an agglomerant free formulation of 0.72% guar solution
in water and 6 ppa of 20/40 mesh sand. Example 1 contained a fiber agglomerant, having
0.72% guar solution in water, 6 ppa 20/40 mesh sand (22% vol), 20 ppt (2.4g/L) polyamide
fiber (length 6 mm, diameter 12 microns). Each of Example 1 and Comparative Example 1
were poured into separate 4 mm by 6 inch (15cm) by 8 inch (20cm) test slots made of
acrylic glass with slot width of 4mm. Initially, each fluid appeared homogeneous. The slots
were observed one hour later. Example 1 exhibited heterogeneous settling of the proppant
in the slot which resulted in creation of proppant-rich clusters and areas which were
substantially free of proppant. In contrast, Comparative Example 1 exhibited homogenous
settling of the proppant to the bottom portion of the slot.
Example 2: Defining bridgingability.
[0091] The equipment consisted of an accumulator (1" Swagelok tube with volume of 350
ml) connected to a small 1" tube with a slot inside. The slot width was 0.08 inch (2mm). The
other end of the accumulator was connected to a Knauer HPLC K-1800 pump that provided
continuous pumping. The system was equipped with a pressure relief valve and an
electronic analog pressure transducer installed between the pump and the accumulator.
Pressure measurements were carried out by using a National Instrument data acquisition
system which converted analog pressure readings from the pressure transducer to a
numerical format.
[0092] A fluid comprising a viscosified liquid, particulate material and fiber was placed in the
accumulator (100 ml of 0.6% guar gum solution was placed in the system prior to the slurry
to keep the slurry from contacting the slot). Then a plastic spacer was inserted and the
system was connected to the pump. Bridging ability of the slurry was studied by pumping
the fiber laden slurry through the slot at a constant flow rate which corresponded to a
constant velocity inside the slot at a fluid rate in the range of 0.5 ft/second (0.15
meter/second).
[0093] The primary criterion for bridging was the presence of a plug in the slot which was
found there after taking the system apart. The time of bridging was indicated by a sharp
pressure increase in the system during the experiment.
[0094] Fig. 2 is a graph illustrating the bridging dependence for a mixture comprising 0.6%
guar solution, PLA fiber and 20/40 mesh sand. PLA fibers had length of 6mm and diameter
of 12microns. The figure shows two distinct areas separated by a solid curve. As can be

seen in Fig. 2, the upper part of the plot represents the range of loadings of fiber and
proppant which caused bridging in the slot. The area on the lower part of the graph
represents the range of loadings of fiber and proppant which did not bridge, and where the
slurry was observed to flow through the slot without impairment.
Example 3: Empirical model for bridgingof fiber-laden fluids
[0095] Regression of the bridging experiments results yielded the numerical values of the
fitting parameters in the following equation (1):
 0 = cost -w'u'p  /IEqn.                                 1
where      - minimal concentration of fiber material required for bridging,          w - effective
fracture width, u - fluid velocity and P - fluid viscosity at given shear rate. Parameters a, #6,
y are constants obtained by regression of the data from the laboratory experiments.
Respectively, they are functions of the shape, the mechanical properties of the bridging
material, and nature and the formulation of the base fluid.
[0096] Fig.3 illustrates an example of the results obtained in the laboratory and the
corresponding curve for a single set of values for the constant parameters in equation (1).
The fiber concentration sufficient for bridging is reported against fluid velocity in slots of
different width. As shown in Fig. 3, the amount of fiber required for bridging increased with
the fluid velocity.
Example 4: Quantification of heterogeneity of proppant distribution.
[0097] Example 4 describes a possible methodology for quantifying the degree of
heterogeneity of proppant concentration in a void, e.g. in a hydraulic fracture. Such degree
will be defined as a ratio between propped and total surface area, as shown by
[0098] Figures 4a-4c provides illustrations for this approach. Figure 4a shows a laboratory
slot 1 with proppant clusters 2 inside the slot 1, wherein each proppant clusters comprises
fibrous agglomerant 3 and proppant 4. Figure 4b is a graphical representation of the slot 1
where propped areas are shown shaded and non-propped areas are shown as clear areas.
Figure 4c shows the dependence of the heterogeneity factor S            /S,0 ,01 calculated across
the height of the slot. This factor changes in the range of 0-1, where 0 corresponds to the
area free of solids and 1 corresponds to completely propped area with no proppant free
channels.
Example 5: Quantificationof degree of settling heterogeneity and channelization:

[0099] The defined channelization index as described in connection with Fig. 1 can be used
to differentiate between various channelization scenarios in dynamic conditions as well as in
static. The composition of the mixtures in the Examples was the following: 0.72% guar
solution; 12vol% of sand with particle size between 0.43-0.20mm; 1.2g.L (Example A) and
4.8g/L (Example B) of polylactic acid (PLA) fiber with length of 6mm and 12micron in
diameter. Experimental procedure and the slot were the same as used in Example 1. As
can be seen in Figure 5, solids free areas in Example A begin to form in -0.5hours
(channelization    index=2)    and     interconnected     channels    between     solids-free zones
(channelization index =3) are formed in about 1hr. Solids-free areas in Example B were
formed in about 1 hour and interconnected solids-free channels were not formed after 6
hours.
[00100]          Table 1 illustrates the channelization index of several treatment slurries
wherein the amount of fiber agglomerant and the size of solid particulates (sand) are varied.
The treatment slurries included 0.72% guar solution in water; sand type concentration:
12vol%; sand type: as defined on the Table 1, agglomerate type: PLA fiber with 6mm in
length and 12 micron in diameter. Experimental procedure and equipment used were the
same as described in Example 1. Each experiment had been continued out for 6 hours.
Table 1 provides the channelization index and the time to reach such index for each type of
treatment slurry.    For example, for the treatment slurry with 20/40 mesh sand and fiber
concentration of 4.8g/L, it took 0.17hours for the system to form non-interconnected solids
free areas (channelization index 2). Interconnected channels (channelization index 3) were
not formed in this experiment during the 6 hour time of the experiment.

Example 6: Defining maximum time for channelization.
[00101]          Calculations were conducted assuming a treatment slurry containing 0.72%
guar solution; 12vol% of sand with particle size 0.43-0.2mm and 2.4g/L of PLA fiber
agglomerant with fiber length of 6 mm and diameter of 12 microns. Further assumptions
include that the slurry is placed in a hydraulic fracture in shale formation with leak-off
coefficient in range of Ct= 3.9E-6 - 2.OE-5 m/s"            and spurt loss coefficient of 0.204E-3
m3/m2 . The shale formation has the following properties and confined between layers with
high frac gradient: TVD:800m; zone height 30m; frac gradient in the zone 14.OkPa/m;
Young Modulus 2e7kPa; Poisson's ratio 0.18. The pumping schedule is shown in Table 2.

[00102]         Channelization must be completed before fracture closure, because no
proppant agglomeration will be possible after fracture closure. At the same time, as it will be
shown in Example 11 channelization ability is dependent on concentration of agglomerant
and proppant and does not take place if concentrations of these agents are above some
certain limits. For example no interconnected channels are formed during settling of the
compositions comprising >22vol% of sand and 4.8g/L of PLA fiber with length of 6mm and
diameter of 12micron.
[00103]         Note, that the concentration of the components of the slurry pumped in a
hydraulic fracture is getting higher with time because of fluid leak-off from the fracture. So
for the used formulation it means that the interconnected channels must be formed before
slurry is concentrated two times (meaning before sand concentration is increased from
12vol% to 22vol% and fiber concentration is increased from 1.2g/L to 4.8g/L).
[00104]         It is assumed that the pumping (placement) time for the slurry is relatively
short and almost no leak-off takes place during placement. In this situation slurry will be
concentrated after the job during the fracture closure. Figure 6 shows the calculated profile
of average fracture width in near wellbore zone for the created hydraulic fracture during the
fracture closure. Calculations are performed in FracCADE 7.2 using P3D model and zonal
parameters described above and various leak coefficients. For example, for leak-off
coefficient of 3.9E-06 m/s 05 , fracture width will decrease in 2 times in 280 min after
placement of treatment slurry. That means that in 280 min approximately 50% of fluid from
the fracture will leak into formation and, therefore, the slurry in the fracture will become two
times more concentrated. Therefore the acceptable channelization time for the slurry in this
situation should be less than 280min. Table 2 shows results of similar computations for the
acceptable channelization time for the given slurry mixture for other leak-off coefficients, as
shown in Table 2.

Example 7. Impact of wall roughness on channelization
[00105]         The impact of wall rough ness on channelization time is examined in
Example 7. As used in Example 7, the channelization time means the time required for the
treatment slurry to form solids-free interconnected channels, e.g., channelization index of 3.
The same equipment used in Example 1 was used for Example 7 except that various grains

of sand paper were glued to the plates. Each experiment was continued out for 6 hours. The
treatment slurry contained 0.72% guar solution in water; sand concentration: 12vol%; sand
type (as defined in Table 3), agglomerant type: PLA fiber with 6 mm in length and 12 micron
in diameter. Table 3 illustrates the channelization times (to reach channelization index 3) for
the treatment slurry with varying slot widths and magnitude of wall roughness. As can be
seen in Table 3, interactions with the walls play an important role in channelization.
However, channelization occurs even when the walls are smooth (wall roughness
<1 micron).

[00106]         Channelization behavior and timing were examined for a number of various
treatment slurries.   The equipment used was as in Example 1, except that sandpaper
having a grain size of 22 microns was adhered to slot walls. Each experiment had been
continued out for 6 hours. The slot width was 3 mm. The various treatment slurries
contained 0.72% guar solution in water sand size 0.43-0.2mm; sand concentration: 12vol%;

As can be seen in Table 4, the rheology of the carrier fluid impacts channelization.
[00107]           Figure 7 illustrates the rheology dependencies for the carrier fluids listed in
Table 4. As can be seen, channelization occurs when the solid particulates settle in the
range of shear rates between 0.001 and 0.1s-1 (see example 10).               Carrier fluids with
viscosity higher than 1,000,000 cP in this shear rate range did not enable channelization in
the performed experiments. Carrier fluids with viscosity less than 2,000 cP did not result in
channelization. Carrier fluids with viscosities from 2,000 cP to 1,000,000 cP in the range of
shear rates 0.001-0.1s1 enabled channelization.
Example 9: Maximum acceptable carrier fluidyield stress for channelization.

[00108]          Yield stress of the carrier fluid should be sufficiently low to enable
agglomeration of the solids via settling leading to channelization. This value may be defined
by balancing the yield stress with pressure of individual solids grain suspended in a carrier
fluid

where 7ma- maximum acceptable yield stress, PP - density of the solid grain,          - density
of the carrier fluid, R - grain radius. For sand with grain size of 0.43mm and gelled water
this equation yields 7m- =1 Pa.
Example 10: Range of shear rates during solids settling
[00109]          Range of shear rates during solids settling may be estimated as settling rate
above grain size. The lowest and maximum settling rates registered in the performed
experiments were 3.3mm/hr and 178mm/hr. So for the performed experiments:

Example 11: Impact of solids concentration on channelization.
[00110]          The impact of sand concentration on channelization was examined.           The
equipment used was as described in Example 1, except that sandpaper having a grain size
of 22 microns was adhered to the walls of the slot.                  Various slot widths, sand
concentrations, sand grain sizes and carrier fluid viscosities were examined, as shown in
Table 5. The treatment slurry contained 0.48% and 0.72% guar solution in water; sand
concentration of 4.3, 12, 22 and 27 vol%; agglomerate type: PLA fiber with 6 mm in length
and 12 microns in diameter added in concentration of 2.4g/L.
[00111]          The entries in Table 5 provide channelization index/time to reach such index
(hours).   For example, for 4.3 vol% 20/40 mesh sand in 0.48% guar gum in a 3mm slot
width experimental apparatus, the time to reach channelization index 3 was 0.1 hours. As
can be seen in Table 5, sand concentration impacts channelization.             For instance, no
channels were formed when sand concentration was more than or equal to 22vol%
irrespective of carrier fluid, slot width and sand grain sizes.

Example 12: Impact of solids density on channelization
[00112]          The impact of sand density on channelization was examined.              Fig. 8
illustrates the time dependence of channelization index for two different treatment slurries
differing in the density of the proppant.
[00113]          Example C included proppant with grain size of 0.84-0.43mm (20/40 mesh)
and density of 3.58g/cm3 . Example D included sand with the same grain size and density of
2.65g/cm3 . Both Examples C and D included 0.72% guar solution in water; agglomerate
type: PLA fiber with 6 mm in length and 12 micron in diameter added in concentration of
2.4g/L; volumetric concentration of proppant/sand in both Example C and D was 12vol%.
The equipment and procedure used were the same as described in Example 1, except that
sandpaper with grain size of 22 microns was adhered to the slot walls.
[00114]          As can be seen in Fig. 8, an increase in density of proppant facilitates
achieving a channelization index of 3.
Example 13: Impact of agglomerant geometry and concentration on channelization.
[00115]          The impact of agglomerant geometry and concentration on channelization
was examined. Various compositions with varying agglomerant concentrations, slot widths
and sand grain sizes were tested using the same equipment as in Example 1, except that
sandpaper having a grain size of 22 microns was adhered to the slot walls. Each treatment
slurry contained     0.72% guar gum solution;        12vol% sand and fiber agglomerant in

concentration of 0-4.8g/. The fiber agglomerant was polylactic acid (PLA) fibers having a
length of 6 mm and a diameter of 12 microns, and a density of 1.25 g/cm.
[00116]         Table 6 shows channelization diagram giving channelization index and time
to achieve the state for the various compositions. As previously, NA indicates data not
obtained and 0/-- indicates that the fluid remained in channelization index 0 for the entire
test time, 6 hours. As can be seen in Table 6, fiber concentration impacts channelization.
For instance, no solids-free interconnected channels were formed when fiber concentration
was more than or equal to 4.8g/L (which corresponds to 0.38 vol%) for all slot widths and
sand grain sizes.
