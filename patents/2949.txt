                      ANTIBODY AND PROTEIN FORMULATIONS
             This application is being filed on 28 August 2013, as a PCT International
    patent application, and claims priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 13/601,598,
  5  filed August 31, 2012, and U.S. Patent Application No. 13/843,780, filed March 15,
    2013, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their
    entirety.
            The present application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No.
    2013308902, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                         BACKGROUND
10           The present disclosure relates generally to antibody and other protein
    formulations that are isosmotic and of low viscosity, including formulations that are
    useful for injection and general administration.
             Hemophilia patients have bleeding disorders that result in delayed blood
    clotting after an injury or surgery.       Prolonged bleeding is caused by a genetic
15  deficiency in one or more blood clotting factor. Two common types of hemophilia
    are known -- hemophilia A and hemophilia B. Hemophilia A is caused by a
    deficiency in factor VIII whereas hemophilia B is caused by a deficiency in factor
    IX. About 75-80% of total hemophilia patients have hemophilia A.
             Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a human inhibitor of the extrinsic
20  pathway of blood coagulation and functions in anticoagulation. Antibodies that are
    directed against TFPI, including anti-TFPI monoclonal antibodies (aTFPI mAb), are
    being developed in an effort to block TFPI function. One such aTFPI mAb is a
    human IgG2 anti-TFPI mAb. that is being developed for the treatment of hemophilia
    A and B patients.
25           Antibody    and other proteins      may be administrated       to patients  via
    intravenous, intramuscular,     and/or subcutaneous      injection.   To ensure patient
    compliance, it is desirable that subcutaneous injection dosage forms be isotonic
    and include small injection volumes (<2.0 ml per injection site). To reduce
    injection volume, proteins are often administered within the range of 1 mg/ml to 150
    mg/ml.
30           While both liquid and lyophilized dosage forms are used for currently
    marketed antibody and other protein-based drug products, lyophilized forms
    are
                                                 1

     more frequently used for protein and antibody drug products having high protein
     concentrations.
             A protein and antibody dosage form may present many challenges in
     formulation development, especially for liquid formulation.        For formulations in
  5  which the protein concentration is near its apparent solubility limit, phase separation
     can occur through precipitation, gelation, and/or crystallization.     At high protein
     concentration, the stability of an antibody or other protein can become problematic
     due to the formation of soluble and insoluble protein-protein aggregates. Highly
     concentrated protein formulations are frequently highly viscous, which presents
 10 difficulties for processing, such as ultrafiltration and sterile filtration, and for
     injection of the dosage solution. And at protein concentrations that are desirable for
    formulations intended for intramuscular or subcutaneous administration, high
    concentrations of stabilizers, such as sucrose and sodium chloride, are required to
    achieve long-term protein stability. The resulting hypertonic solutions often cause
15  injection pain due to tissue damage. Therefore, it is critical to balance the amount of
    stabilizers for stability and osmolality of the high protein concentration formulation.
             For these reasons, there is a need in the art for antibody and other protein
    based    therapeutic    formulations   in liquid    form   that exhibit    high protein
    concentrations without the problem of significantly increased protein aggregation,
20  osmolality, or viscosity and/or decreased protein stability. It is, therefore, desirable
    that antibody and other protein-based formulations contain limited amounts of
    excipients and small volumes for ease of therapeutic administration or delivery. It is
    further desirable that antibody and other protein-based therapeutic formulations be
    amenable to lyophilization to enhance protein stability under prolonged storage
25  conditions.
                                           SUMMARY
             The present disclosure provides liquid and lyophilized antibody and protein
    based formulations that are substantially isotonic and low viscosity and that contain
    substantially no inorganic salt. The antibody and other protein formulations presented
30  herein contain from about 0 mM to about 30 mM histidine; from about 50 ppm to
    about 200 ppm of a non-ionic surfactant such as, for example, polysorbate (Tween@)
                                                 2

     80 or polysorbate (Tween@) 20; from about 88 mM to about 292 mM of a sugar or
     sugar alcohol such as, for example, mannitol, dextrose, glucose, trehalose, and/or
     sucrose; from about 0 mM to about 50 mM arginine; from about 0 mM to about 50
     mM lysine; from about 0 mM to about 133 mM glycine or alanine; from about 0 mM
  5 to about 10 mM methionine; and from about 1 mg/ml to about 150 mg/ml of a protein
     at a pH from about pH 4.0 to about pH 6.0. The formulations disclosed herein exhibit
    a viscosity ranging from about 1 mPa-S to about 20 mPa-S at 22*C, or from about 1
    mPa-S to about 15 mPa-S at 22 0 C, or from about 1 mPa-S to about 10 mPa-S at 22*C
    or from about I mPa-S to about 8 mPa-S at 22*C or from about 1 mPa-S to about 6
 10 mPa-S at 22*C and osmolality ranging from about 240 to about 380 mmol/kg.
             Within further aspects, the present disclosure provides methods for the
    treatment of a disorder in a patient, comprising the administration to the patient of a
    therapeutically effective amount of one or more formulations described herein. For
    example, provided are methods for the treatment of a disorder in a patient,
15  comprising the administration to the patient of a therapeutically effective amount of
    an antibody or other protein formulation as described in greater detail herein.
            These and other features of the present teachings are set forth herein.
                        BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
            The skilled artisan will understand that the drawings, described below, are
20  for illustration purposes only. The drawings are not intended to limit the scope of
    the present teachings in any way.

25  mAb drug substance.
                      DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS
            As described above, the present disclosure provides antibody and other
    protein formulations that stabilize the antibody or other protein in liquid form or
30  lyophilized form at intended storage conditions. The formulations described herein
    include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or stabilizers, and are
                                               3

   contained in buffered media at a suitable pH and are substantially isosmotic with
   physiological fluids.      For systemic administration, injection is one route of
   administration, including intramuscular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous
   injection.
 5          Because of their low viscosity, the presently disclosed protein formulations
   can be conveniently processed via, for example, ultrafiltration and sterile filtration and
   can be administered to a patient via injection, including subcutaneous injection.
   Moreover, because they are substantially isosmotic, the presently disclosed antibody
   and protein formulations reduce tissue damage or other adverse physiologic effects
10 and thereby achieving favorable patient tolerance and increased patient compliance.
           The formulations described herein are characterized by the substantial absence
   of added salt, which provides the flexibility for increasing the concentrations of other
   stabilizers, such as sucrose, while maintaining the osmolality of the formulation for
   improved in vivo tolerability and, consequently, increased patient compliance.
15 Moreover, the low viscosity of the presently described formulations permits convenient
   processing, including but not limited to ultrafiltration and sterile filtration, and injection
   of the drug product solution through the needle.
           As used herein, the term "viscosity" refers to the resistance of a liquid
   formulation to flow, such as when injected through a syringe needle during
20 administration to a patient. Viscosity measurements can be done by a cone and plate
   technique with a Peltier element set at a defined temperature, such as 22*C as
   described herein. Typically, a well-defined shear stress gradient is applied to the
   liquid formulation and the resulting shear rate is measured. The viscosity is the ratio
   of the shear stress to the shear rate. As used herein, viscosity is expressed in units of
25 mPa-S at 22*C wherein 1 mPa-S = 1 cP. The low viscosity, substantially isosmotic
   formulations disclosed herein are typically characterized by having a viscosity
   ranging from about 1 mPa-S to about 20 mPa-S at 22*C, or from about I mPa-S to
   about 15 mPa-S at 22*C, or from about I mPa-S to about 10 mPa-S at 22*C or from
   about 1 mPa-S to about 8 mPa-S at 22*C or from about I mPa-S to about 6 mPa-S at
30 22 0 C.
            As used herein, the term "osmolality" refers to a measure of solute
   concentration, defined as the number of mmole of solute per kg of solution. A
                                                4

   desired level of osmolality can be achieved by the addition of one or more stabilizer
   such as a sugar or sugar alcohol including, but not limited to, mannitol, dextrose,
   glucose, trehalose, and/or sucrose. Additional stabilizers that are suitable for providing
   osmolality are described in references such as the handbook of Pharmaceutical
 5 Excipients (Fourth Edition, Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, Science &
   Practice Publishers) or Remingtons:         The Science and Practice of Pharmacy
   (Nineteenth Edition, Mack Publishing Company).
            As used herein, the term "about" refers to +/- 10% of the unit value provided.
   As used herein, the term "substantially" refers to the qualitative condition of
10 exhibiting a total or approximate degree of a characteristic or property of interest.
   One of ordinary skill in the biological arts will understand that biological and
   chemical phenomena rarely, if ever, achieve or avoid an absolute result. The term
   substantially is therefore used herein to capture the potential lack of completeness
   inherent in many biological and chemical phenomena. As used herein, the terms
15 "isosmotic" and "isotonic" are used interchangeably with the terms "substantially
   isosmotic," and "substantially isotonic" and refer to formulations characterized by
   having an osmotic pressure that is the same as or at least substantially equivalent to the
   osmotic pressure of another solution, which is achieved by formulations wherein the
   total concentration of solutes, including both permeable and impermeable solutes, in
20 the formulation are the same as or at least substantially equivalent to the total
   number of solutes in another solution. Thus, while it will be appreciated by those of
   skill in the art that "isosmotic" and "isotonic" formulations that are used for in vivo
   administration generally have an osmolality ranging from about 270 mmol/kg to
   about 310 mmol/kg, in the context of the low viscosity formulations of the present
25 disclosure, the terms "isosmotic,"       "isotonic,"   "substantially    isosmotic," and
   "substantially isotonic" are used interchangeably to refer to formulations having an
   osmolality ranging from about 240 mmol/kg to about 380 mmol/kg, or from about
   270 mmol/kg to about 370 mmol/kg, or from about 300 mmol/kg to about 330
   mmol/kg.
30         The presently disclosed low viscosity, substantially isosmotic antibody and
   other protein formulations contain from about 0 mM to about 30 mM histidine; from
   about 50 ppm to about 200 ppm of a non-ionic surfactant such as, for example,
                                              5

     polysorbate (Tween@) 80 or polysorbate (Tween@) 20; from about 88 mM to about
     292 mM of a sugar or sugar alcohol such as, for example, mannitol, dextrose, glucose,
     trehalose, and/or sucrose; from about 0 mM to about 50 mM arginine; from about 0
     mM to about 50 mM lysine; from about 0 mM to about 133 mM glycine or alanine;
  5  from about 0 mM to about 10 mM methionine; and from about 1 mg/ml to about 150
     mg/ml of a protein at a pH from about pH 4 to about pH 6.                The formulations
     disclosed herein exhibit a viscosity ranging viscosity ranging from about I mPa-S to
     about 20 mPa-S at 22*C, or from about 1 mPa-S to about 15 mPa-S at 22*C, or from
     about 1 mPa-S to about 10 mPa-S at 22*C or from about I mPa-S to about 8 mPa-S at
 10  22*C or from about 1 mPa-S to about 6 mPa-S at 22*C and osmolality ranging from
     about 240 to about 380 mmol/kg.
             In these formulations, histidine - is a buffer agent, that can be used to maintain
     the formulation pH from about pH 4 to about pH 6.0, or about pH 5 to about pH 6,
     such as about pH 5, about pH 5.5, or about pH 6. Sugar or sugar alcohols, such as
15   mannitol, dextrose, glucose, trehalose, and/or sucrose, are used separately or in
     combination, both as cryo-protectants and a stabilizer the antibody in liquid
     formulations as well as during and after lyophilization. Non-ionic surfactants such as
    polysorbates, including polysorbate 20 and polysorbate 80; polyoxamers, including
    poloxamer 184 and 188; pluronic@ polyols; and other ethylene/polypropylene block
20  polymers, stabilize the antibody during processing and storage by reducing interfacial
     interaction and prevent protein from adsorption. Arginine is a protein solubilizer and
    also a stabilizer that reduces antibody and other protein aggregation, such as aTFPI
    mAb aggregation, and glycation. Methionine is an antioxidant that prevents antibody
    oxidation during processing and storage.
25           Sugars and inorganic salts are commonly used as protein stabilizers;
    however, both sugars and inorganic salts are also effective tonicity agents.           If a
    formulation requires a high concentration of one or more sugars to stabilize a
    protein, the inorganic salt concentration should be zero or kept very low in order to
    maintain the formulation's osmolality such that injection pain is reduced upon
30  administration. Quite surprisingly, it was found that sodium chloride increased the
    turbidity of antibody formulations.      Consequently, inorganic salts are substantially
    excluded from addition to the formulations described herein.               These non-salt
                                                  6

    formulations maintain the osmolality of the antibody and other protein formulations
   with increased stability, and reduced phase change, such as precipitation or
   aggregation.
           As used herein, the tenn "salt" refers to inorganic salts, which include but not
 5 limited to sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium sulfate (Na 2SO 4), sodium thiocyanate
   (NaSCN), magnesium chloride (MgCl), magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4), ammonium
   thiocyanate (NH 4SCN), ammonium sulfate ((NH4 )2 SO 4), ammonium chloride
   (NH 4 Cl), calcium chloride (CaC 2), calcium sulfate (CaSO 4), zinc chloride (ZnCl 2)
   and the like, or combinations thereof. The antibody and other protein formulations
10 disclosed herein are characterized by a substantial absence of added salt and are,
   therefore, referred to herein as salt-free antibody and/or protein formulations. It will
   be understood by those of skill in the art that the presence of inorganic salts within
   the presently disclosed formulations that are introduced by pH adjustment are not
   considered to be added salts and such inorganic salts, if present in a formulation
15 according to the present disclosure, should not exceed a concentration of about 2
   mM.
           As used herein, the term "surfactant"          includes non-ionic surfactants
   including, without limitation, polysorbates, such as polysorbate 20 or 80, and the
   polyoxamers, such as poloxamer 184 or 188, Pluronic@ polyols, and other
20 ethylene/polypropylene block polymers.           Amounts of surfactants effective to
   provide stable antibody and other protein formulations are usually in the range of 50
   ppm to 200 ppm. The use of non-ionic surfactants permits the formulations to be
   exposed to shear and surface stresses without causing denaturation of the antibody
   or other protein, and also reduce the adsorption on the surfaces during processing
25 and storage.      The formulations disclosed herein include, without limitation,
   formulations having one or more non-ionic surfactant(s) including, for example, one
   or more polysorbate(s), such as polysorbate 20 or 80; one or more polyoxamers,
   such as poloxamer 184 or 188; one or more Pluronic@ polyol(s); and/or one or more
   ethylene/polypropylene block polymer(s).          Exemplified herein are formulations
30 having a polysorbate, such as polysorbate 20 (Tween@ 20) or polysorbate 80
   (Tween@ 80).
                                                7

            As used herein, the term "protein" refers to amino acid polymers that contain
    at least five constituent amino acids that are covalently joined by peptide bonds.
   The constituent amino acids can be from the group of amino acids that are encoded
   by the genetic code, which include: alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine,
 5 phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, serine, threonine, asparagine, glutamine,
   cysteine, glycine, proline, arginine, histidine, lysine, aspartic acid, and glutamic
   acid. As used herein, the term "protein" is synonymous with the related terms
   "peptide" and "polypeptide".
            As used herein, the term "antibody" refers to a class of proteins that are
10 generally known as immunoglobulins.        Antibodies include full-length monoclonal
   antibodies    (mAb),     such   as  IgG 2 monoclonal      antibodies, which    include
   immunoglobulin Fc regions. The term antibody also includes bispecific antibodies,
   diabodies, single-chain molecules, and antibody fragments such as Fab, F(ab') 2, and
   Fv.
15          As used herein, the term "anti-TFPI antibody" refers to an antibody having
   binding specificity against the human TFPI protein as well as fragments and variants
   of the human TFPI protein. Anti-TFPI antibodies presented herein can be IgG2
   antibodies and include anti-TFPI IgG2 monoclonal antibodies, such as chimeric,
   humanized, and fully-human anti-TFPI IgG2 monoclonal antibodies.            Anti-TFPI
20 antibodies are exemplified in the present disclosure by human anti-TFPI IgG2
   monoclonal antibodies having a light chain comprising the sequence presented
   herein as SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or a heavy chain presented herein as SEQ ID NO: 2.
   Other anti-TFPI monoclonal antibodies, including full-length antibodies and antigen
   binding fragments and variants thereof, that are also suitable for use in the
25 formulations disclosed herein are presented in PCT Patent Publication NOs. WO
   2011/109452 and WO 2010/017196, both of which are incorporated by reference
   herein in their entirety.
            "Monoclonal antibodies" are characterized by having specificity for a single
   antigenic determinant. Monoclonal antibodies can, for example, be made by the
30 hybridoma method described by Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256:495 (1975) or by
   recombinant DNA methods such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567.
   Monoclonal antibodies can also be isolated from phage display libraries using the
                                               8

     techniques such as those described in Clackson et al., Nature 352:624-628 (1991)
     and Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597 (1991).
             Monoclonal antibodies include "chimeric monoclonal antibodies" wherein a
     portion of a heavy and/or light chain includes sequences from antibodies derived
  5  from one species, while the remainder of the antibody, including the Fc region,
     includes sequences from antibodies derived from a second species, typically the
     second species is human. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567 and Morrison et al.,
     Proc.Natl. Acad Sci. USA 81:6851-6855 (1984).
             Monoclonal antibodies also include "humanized monoclonal antibodies"
 10  wherein one or more complementarity determining region (CDR) from a heavy
     and/or light chain sequence from antibodies derived from one species replace one or
     more CDR from a heavy and/or light chain sequence from antibodies derived from a
     second    species, typically the second species is human.          The process of
     "humanization"    is usually applied to monoclonal antibodies developed for
15   administration to humans. See, e.g., Riechmann et al., Nature 332(6162):323-27
     (1988) and Queen et al., Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 86(24):10029-33 (1989).
            Monoclonal antibodies also include "fully-human monoclonal antibodies"
    wherein the entire heavy and light chain sequences are derived from human antibody
     sequences. Fully-human monoclonal antibodies can be generated by phage display
20  technologies and can be isolated from mice that have been genetically engineered to
    express the human antibody repertoire.         See, e.g., McCafferty et al., Nature
    348(6301):552-554 (1990), Marks et al., J. Mol, Biol. 222(3):581-597 (1991), and
    Carmen and Jermutus, BriefFunct.Genomic Proteomic 1(2):189-203 (2002).
            As used herein, the term "Pharmaceutically effective amount" of an antibody
25  or other protein formulation refers to an amount of the formulation that provides
    therapeutic effect in an administration regimen.          The antibody and protein
    formulations disclosed herein typically include an antibody or other protein at a
    concentration ranging from about I mg/ml to about 150 mg/mI, or from about I
    mg/ml to about 100 mg/mI, or from about 1 mg/ml to about 50 mg/mI, or from about
30  1 mg/ml to about 20 mg/ml, or from about 1 mg/ml to about 10 mg/mI, or from
    about 10 mg/ml to about 20 mg/ml, or from about 20 mg/ml to about 150 mg/ml, or
    from about 50 mg/ml to about 150 mg/ml, or from about 60 mg/ml to about 150
                                               9

   mg/ml, or from about 70 mg/ml to about 150 mg/ml, or from about 80 mg/ml to
   about 150 mg/ml, or from about 90 mg/ml to about 150 mg/ml, or from about 100
   mg/ml to about 150 mg/ml, or from about 120 mg/ml to about 150 mg/ml, or from
   about 140 mg/ml to about 150 mg/ml, Within some aspects the concentration of
 5 protein or antibody within these formulations is about 150 mg/ml.                When
   administered subcutaneously, such formulations are typically administered in a
   volume of less than about 2.0 ml, or about 1.5 ml, or about 1 ml, or about 0.5 ml per
   injection site.
           Within certain aspects, the antibody or other protein formulation contains

           Exemplified herein are antibody formulations wherein the antibodies include

   sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 and a heavy chain comprising the sequence of SEQ ID
   NO: 2.

           Thus, the present disclosure provides anti-TFPI mAb formulations, including
   anti-TFPI IgG 2 mAb formulations, wherein the anit-TFPI mAb is soluble at high
   protein concentrations. Typically, the anti-TFPI mAb in the formulations disclosed
   herein remain soluble at concentrations of between about 1 mg/ml and about 150
 5 mg/ml and remain stable under isosmotic storage conditions and exhibit reduced
   viscosity as compared to currently available antibody formulations.
           The anti-TFPI antibody having a light chain comprising the sequence of SEQ
   ID NO: I and a heavy chain comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 is an IgG 2
   antibody that blocks tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI).       Since TFPI down
10 regulates extrinsic coagulation, anti-TFPI antibodies can promote extrinsic pathway
   driven coagulation by blocking TFPI, thereby bypassing FVIII or FIX deficiencies in
   the intrinsic pathway for hemophilia treatment.      The salt free anti-TFPI antibody
   formulations presented herein can be administrated to the patients via subcutaneous
   injection or other injection routes.
15         As part of the present disclosure, it was found that solubility and stability of
   anti-TFPI antibodies was affected by excipients. The solubility of anti-TFPI antibody
   increases with the decrease of NaCl concentrations.       In the absence of NaCl, the
   solubility of anti-TFPI antibody is higher than formulations that include NaCl. In
   addition, it was found that positively changed amino acids, such as arginine and
20 lysine, could improve the stability anti-TFPI antibody and that pH greatly affected the
   anti-TFPI antibody solubility. The turbidity of the antibody solution increased with
   increases in pH; however, the precipitation was reversible when pH was decreased.
   The optimal pH for stabilizing the anti-TFPI antibodies presented herein ranges from
   about pH 4 to about pH 6 or from about pH 5 to about pH 6, such as about pH 5, about
25 pH 5.5, or about pH 6.
            Exemplified herein are formulations, as recited above, wherein the antibody is
   an anti-TFPI antibody (aTFPI Ab). In at least one aspect, the anti-TFPI antibody is a
   human IgG2 monoclonal antibody.           For example, the human anti-TFPI IgG2
   monoclonal antibody includes the antibody that contains a light chain having the
30 amino acid sequence presented in SEQ ID NO: 1 and a heavy chain having the
   amino acid sequence presented in SEQ ID NO: 2.

                                          EXAMPLES
                                           Example 1
20        Effect ofNaCl ConcentrationandpH on the Turbidity ofAntibody Solutions
             This Example discloses the effect of salt (NaCl) concentration and pH on the
    turbidity of solutions containing an anti-TFPI human monoclonal antibody having a
    light chain with the amino acid sequence presented in SEQ ID NO: 1 and a heavy
    chain with the amino acid sequence presented in SEQ ID NO: 2.
25           The turbidity of solutions was measured by Nephelometry to quickly
    evaluate the effects of salt concentrations and pH on aTFPI Ab solutions.          The
    formulation of anti-TFPI antibody used in this Example contained 10 mM acetate
    buffer, 88 mM sucrose, and 200 ppm Tween 80. NaCl concentrations were varied
    from 0 mM to 300 mM. The results of NaCl-dependent turbidity measurements for
30  anti-TFPI formulations at pH 5.5 are presented in Figure 1.                 These data
    demonstrated that the turbidity of the anti-TFPI mAb formulations increased
    significantly with increasing concentration of NaCl. Increasing salt concentration
                                                 15

    from 0 to 300 mM resulted in an increase of 72 FNU in turbidity value by
   Nephelometry,     which    could be attributed to precipitation,       aggregation    or
    insolubilization of aTFPI Ab in solution. As the result of this finding, solutions
   without sodium chloride were recommended for the presently disclosed anti-TFPI
 5 antibody formulations.
           Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the increased turbidity of
   the anti-TFPI mAb formulations with increasing NaCl concentration resulted from
   the neutralization of positive charges on the anti-TFPI mAb arginine side-chains.
   The phase behavior of aTFPI mAb at different pH with the impact of monovalent
10 salt (NaCI) explains why the stable, soluble, non-salt, and substantial isosmolality
   aTFPI mAb formulations could be achieved.
           The presently disclosed aTFPI mAb molecule has 116 amino acids (42
   arginines and 74 lysines) having side-chain carrying positive charges at the pH
   below PI. This anti-TFPI antibody has a PI at ~7.9. At a pH below the PI, such as
15 pH 4-6, this anti-TFPI antibody has net positive charges.         The repulsion of the
   positive charges on this anti-TFPI antibody surface likely prevents protein-protein
   association between individual molecules and, thereby, significantly increases
   solubility. It is hypothesized that the anion (C-) of salt binds to the guanidinium
   group on arginine side-chains on the anti-TFPI antibody surface to neutralize the
20 positive charges, which enhances protein-protein interactions and, hence, causes
   lower solubility and solution turbidity.     By shifting the pH to 4-6, the non-salt
   formulations that are described herein were developed to achieve increased antibody
   solubility and stability (see, Figure 1). In absence of salt, the concentration of other
   stabilizers, such as sucrose, can be increased to >150 mM and <300 mM without
25 compromising osmolality.
           The effect of pH on the turbidity of anti-TFPI antibodies was also studied.
   As shown in Figure 2, pH can also greatly affect the turbidity of aTFPI Ab solution.
   When pH was increased from 4 to 6.5, the turbidity of aTFPI Ab solution increased
   by 81 FNU. Further increasing pH to 7, the turbidity of solution was out of the
30 range for accurate measurement. However, the formed precipitates in the solution
   were reversible when pH was decreased.          This result could be attributed to the
   surface charge neutralization when pH was increased to the value close to the PI of
                                               16

    aTFPI Ab, since the PI value of aTFPI Ab is approximately 7.9. According to this
    study, lower pH was preferred for aTFPI Ab formulations. However, low pH could
    cause tissue irritation during injection. Therefore, a neutral pH was preferred from
    patient compliance point of view. Balancing these two factors, the optimum pH of
 5  aTFPI Ab formulations is between pH 5 and pH 6.
                                           Example 2
                              Anti-TFPIAntibodv Formulations
            Based upon the unexpected findings presented in Example 1, substantially
   isosmotic anti-TFPI Ab formulations were prepared without NaCl.                   These
10 formulations typically employed high sucrose concentrations to help stabilize the
   anti-TFPI Ab.
           Frozen anti-TFPI antibody was thawed and reformulated by dialysis
   according to formulations presented in Table 1. The formulations were prepared and
   were filtered with a 0.22 pm filter and filled in glass tubing vials and stoppered with
15 rubber stoppers.
           It was also found that in the absence of NaCl, and in the presence of sucrose
   88 mM to 292 mM and polysorbate 80 or polysorbate 20 (50-200 ppm), the positive
   charged amino acids, such as arginine (10-50 mM), can effectively inhibit aTFPI Ab
   from glycation.

 5                   The Effect ofArginine on Anti-TFPIAb Glycation
           The Example demonstrates that anti-TFPI Ab formulations containing
   arginine exhibit reduced antibody glycation as compared to anti-TFPI Ab
   formulations without added arginine.
           Anti-TFPI Ab formulations, with and without arginine, at pH 6 were stored
10 at 40*C for 14 days and tested by LC-MS.          The results presented in Table 3
   demonstrate that the positively-charged amino acid arginine reduces glycation of
   anti-TFPI Ab, possibly due to the unique structure of aTFPI Ab, to the level found in
   a reference standard.

 5          It can be concluded based on the results of this study that the stability of
   aTFPI Ab is highly impacted by formulation pH and the optimum pH for the
   stability of the formulation is between pH 5 and pH 6 when IV, IM and
   subcutaneous injection are considered. Arginine appeared to be able to prevent
   aTFPI Ab glycation. The formulation development and stability studies presented in
10 Example 4 and Example 5 were designed based on these findings.
