                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
    [0002]    Psychiatric disorders include any mental disorder or illness that interferes with the
10 way a person behaves, interacts with others, and/or functions in daily life. The Diagnostic
   and SatisticalMemual (DSM).3 of mentall Disorders,published by the American Psychiatric
   Association, classifies psychiatric disorders. The latest version, the DSM-5 (Fifth Edition),
   lists the following categories of mental disorders: adjustment disorders; anxiety disorders;
   delirium, dementia, amnestic, and other cognitive disorders; disorders usually first diagnosed
15  in infancy, childhood or adolescence, such as learning disorders or communication disorders;
   dissociative disorders; eating disorders; factitious disorders; impulse-control disorders;
   mental disorders due to a general medical condition; mood disorders; other conditions of
    clinical importance; personality disorders; schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders;
    sexual and gender identity disorders; sleep disorders; somatoform disorders; and substance
20  related disorders. See also, h ttp://www.dsm5.org.
    10003]    The exact cause of most psychiatric disorders is not known. Mental health experts
    believe that psychiatric disorders typically result from a combination of genetic or inherited
    dispositions and a triggering event. Triggering events may include environmental factors,
    stresses of various kinds, and even physical health problems. Psychiatric disorders are very
25  common in the United States. In fact, one-fifth of the American population suffers from
    some sort of mental disorder during any given year, according to the American Psychiatric
    Association.
    [00041    Medication is widely used to treat a variety of psychiatric disorders. For example,
    antidepressants are used for the treatment of clinical depression as well as for anxiety and
30  other disorders. Anxiolytics are used for anxiety disorders and related problems such as
    insomnia. Mood stabilizers are used primarily in bipolar disorder, mainly targeting mania
                                                     1

   WO 2013/184824                                                                  PCT/US2013/044342
    rather than depression. Antipsychotics are used for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia.
    Stimulants are commonly used, notably for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADID).
    However, despite the existence of an assortment of different medications, there is a need in
    the art for improved drugs (e.g., improved onset of action, increased efficacy, fewer adverse
 5  events, better adherence, etc,) to treat psychiatric disorders, particularly mood disorders (e.g,
    depression), anxiety and symptoms thereof. The present invention satisfies this need and
    provides related advantages as well.
                              BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

10  one or more symptoms of depression and/or anxiety in a subject comprising administering a
    therapeutically effective amount of an NCAM peptide mimetic to the subject. In some other
    aspects, the present invention provides methods for treating a neurological condition such as
    a psychiatric disorder (e.g., mood disorders including depression and bipolar disorder, or
    anxiety) in a subject comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an
15  NCAM peptide mimetic to the subject.

             wherein Z is an individually selected peptide comprising the amino acid sequence
20  QQGKSKA, DVRRGIKKTD, or variants thereof; L is individually selected from the group
    consisting of optionally substituted lipophilic substituents, optionally substituted linkers, and
    optionally substituted spacers; n is an individually selected integer from about 1 to 6; n is an
    individually selected integer from about 0 to 6; and q is an individually selected integer from
    about 1 to 4.

                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
    1.      Introduction
    [00201    The present invention is based, in part, upon the surprising discovery that NCAM
10  peptide mimetics are useful for treating or alleviating one or more symptoms of depression
    and/or anxiety in a subject in need thereof such as a subject having a neurological condition.
    In other aspects, the NCAM peptide mimetics described herein also find utility in treating a
    neurological condition such as a psychiatric disorder (e.g., a mood disorder, e.g., depression
    or bipolar disorder, or other psychiatric disorders such as, e.g., anxiety) in a subject in need
15  thereof. In particular aspects, NCAM peptide mimetics such as, e.g., FGLmn, FGLL, FGLs,
    and plannexin advantageously have the ability to modulate depression (e.g, to produce an
    antidepressant effect) and/or anxiety (e.g, to produce an anxiolytic effect) and therefore are
    useful for preventing, treating, and/or alleviating neurological conditions and/or one or more
    symptoms thereof such as depression and/or anxiety.
20  1IL     Definitions
     [00211   A "psychiatric disorder" or "mental disorder" or metal illness" includes mood
    disorders (e.g., depression of all forms and/or types, bipolar disorder, etc.), anxiety, anxiety
    disorders, psychotic disorders (eg., schizophrenia, personality disorders), as well as other
    mental disorders such as substance-related disorders, childhood disorders, dementia, autistic
25  disorder, adjustment disorder, delirium, multi-infarct dementia, and Tourette's disorder as
    described in, e.g., the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders, Fifth
    Edition (DSM-5). Typically, such disorders have a complex genetic and/or a biochemical
    component.
     [00221   A "mood disorder" as used herein includes disruption of feeling, tone or emotional
30  state experienced by an individual for an extensive period of time. Mood disorders include,

   WO 2013/184824                                                                   PCT/US2013/044342
    but are not limited to, depression (i.e., depressive disorders), bipolar disorders, substance
    induced mood disorders, alcohol-induced mood disorders, benzodiazepine-induced mood
    disorders, mood disorders due to general medical conditions, as well as many others. See,
    e.g, DSM-5. There are many general medical conditions that can trigger mood episodes,
 5  including, but not limited to, neurological disorders (e.g., dementias), metabolic disorders
    (e.g, electrolyte disturbances), gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., cirrhosis), endocrine disease
    (e.g., thyroid abnormalities), cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart attack), pulmonary disease
    (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), cancer, autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid
    arthritis), and the like.
10   100231    The term "depression" or "depressive disorder" includes a mood disorder involving
    any of the following symptoms: persistent sad, anxious, and/or "empty" mood; feelings of
    hopelessness and/or pessimism; feelings of guilt, worthlessness, and/or helplessness; loss of
    interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed, including sex: decreased
    energy, fatigue, and/or being "slowed down"; difficulty concentrating, remembering, and/or
15  making decisions; insomnia, early-morning awakening, and/or oversleeping; loss of appetite
    and/or weight loss, overeating and/or weight gain; thoughts of death and/or suicide; suicide
    attempts: restlessness and/ or irritability; persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to
    treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders, and/or chronic pain; and combinations
    thereof See, e.g., DSM-5. Non-limiting examples of depressive disorders include major
20  depression disorder (MDD), atypical depression, melancholic depression, psychotic major
    depression or psychotic depression, catatonic depression, postpartum depression, seasonal
    affective disorder (SAD), chronic depression (dysthymia), double depression, depressive
    disorder not otherwise specified, depressive personality disorder (DPD), recurrent brief
    depression (RBD), minor depressive disorder (minor depression), premenstrual syndrome,
25  premenstrual dysphoric disorder, depression caused by chronic medical conditions (e.g.,
    cancer, chronic pain, chemotherapy, chronic stress), and combinations thereof. Various
     subtypes of depression are described in, e.g., DSM-5. In particular embodiments, the
    depression is major depression disorder (MDD). In certain instances, the methods of the
    present invention treat or alleviate one or more symptoms of depression. In certain other
30   instances, the methods of the present invention treat depression.
     [00241     "Bipolar disorder" includes a mood disorder characterized by alternating periods of
     extreme moods. A person with bipolar disorder experiences cycling of moods that usually
     swing from being overly elated or irritable (mania) to sad and hopeless (depression) and then
                                                       5

   WO 2013/184824                                                                 PCT/US2013/044342
    back again, with periods of normal mood in between. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder is
    described in, eg., DSM-5. Bipolar disorders include bipolar disorder I (mania with or
    without major depression), bipolar disorder II (hypomania with major depression), and
    cyclothymia. See, eg., DSM-5. Bipolar disorder is also known as manic depression.
 5  [0025]     "Anxiety" includes a condition characterized by feelings of worry, nervousness,
    unease, and/or tension, typically about an imminent event or something with an uncertain
    outcome, Symptoms of anxiety include, without limitation, fear, panic, heart palpitations,
    shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea, headaches (e.g., tension headaches), tachycardia, muscle
    weakness and/or tension, chest pain, stomach aches, pallor, sweating, trembling, pupillary
10  dilation, panic attacks, and combinations thereof. See, e.g., DSM-5. In certain instances, the
    methods of the present invention treat or alleviate one or more symptoms of anxiety. In other
    instances, the methods of the present invention treat anxiety or an anxiety disorder.
    [0026]     "A psychotic disorder" includes a condition that affects the mind, resulting in at
    least some loss of contact with reality. Symptoms of a psychotic disorder include, e.g.,
15  hallucinations, changed behavior that is not based on reality, delusions, and the like. See,
    e.g., DSM-5. Schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, delusional
    disorder, brief psychotic disorder, substance-induced psychotic disorder, and shared
    psychotic disorder are non-limiting examples of psychotic disorders.
    [0027]     "Schizophrenia" includes a psychotic disorder involving a withdrawal from reality
20  by an individual. Symptoms comprise for at least a part of a month two or more of the
    following symptoms: delusions (only one symptom is required if a delusion is bizarre, such
    as being abducted in a space ship from the sun); hallucinations (only one symptom is required
    if hallucinations are of at least two voices talking to one another or of a voice that keeps up a
    running commentary on the patient's thoughts or actions); disorganized speech (e.g., frequent
25  derailment or incoherence); grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior; or negative
    symptoms, i.e., affective flattening, alogia, or avolition. Schizophrenia encompasses
    disorders such as, e.g., schizoaffective disorders. Diagnosis of schizophrenia is described in,
    e.g., DSM-5. Types of schizophrenia include, e.g., paranoid, disorganized, catatonic,
    undifferentiated, and residual. See, e.g., DSM-5.
30  [0028]     A "peptide mimetic" or "mimetic peptide" or "peptidomimetic" includes a peptide
    or a fragment or variant thereof that biologically mimics active determinants on proteins such
    as, but not limited to, receptors, hormones, cytokines, enzyme substrates, viruses and other
                                                      6

   WO 2013/184824                                                                   PCT/US2013/044342
   biomolecules, and may antagonize, stimulate, and/or otherwise modulate the physiological
   activity of the natural ligands. See, e.g., Fauchere, A dv. Drug Res. 15:29 (1986); Veber and
   Freidinger, TJNS p. 392 (1985); and Evans et aL., J Med. Chem, 30:1229 (1987), In certain
    instances, peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may
 5 be used to produce an equivalent or enhanced therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Peptide
   mimetics can be composed of natural amino acids, non-natural analogs of amino acids, or
    combinations thereof. Peptide mimetics can also incorporate any amount of natural amino
    acid conservative substitutions as long as such substitutions also do not substantially alter its
    structure and/or activity.
10  [00291     As used herein, an "NCAM peptide mimetic" or "NCAM mnimetic peptide" or
    "NCAM peptidomimetic" includes a peptide or a fragment or variant thereof that mimics
    neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) homophilic binding (e.g., NCAM binding to itself)
    and/or heterophilic binding (e.g., NCAM binding to FGFR, other adhesion molecules, and
    various extracellular matrix components). In some instances, the NCAM peptide mimetic is
15  an antagonist that interferes with, inhibits, or disrupts homophilic binding and/or heterophilic
    binding. In certain other instances, the NCAM peptide mimetic is an agonist that binds and
    activates or stimulates NCAM or an NCAM binding partner (e.g., counter-receptor) such as
    FGFR. See, e.g., Berezin et al., J. Mol. Neuroscience., 22:33-39 (2004).
    100301     The terms "FGL peptide" and "FG loop peptide" include a peptide or a fragment or
20  variant thereof that contains a portion of the amino acid sequence in the second fibronectin
    type IlII (F3) module of NCAM (see, GenPept Accession No. P1359I for exemplary human
    NCAM amino acid sequence), In particular embodiments, the amino acid sequence of the
    FGL peptide corresponds to a portion of the binding site of NCAM to a fibroblast growth
    factor receptor such as FGFR-1. Non-limiting examples of FGL peptides include FGL.,
25  FGLI, FGL,, and combinations thereof.
    100311     An "agonist" includes an agent that binds to a polypeptide and stimulates, increases,
    activates, facilitates, enhances activation, sensitizes or up regulates the activity or expression
    of the polypeptide,
     [0032]     An "antagonist" includes an agent that binds to a polypeptide and inhibits, partially
30  or totally blocks stimulation, decreases, prevents, delays activation, inactivates, desensitizes,
    or down regulates the activity of the polypeptide.

   WO 2013/184824                                                                   PCT/US2013/044342
    [0033]    "Inhibitors," "activators," and "modulators" of binding or activity as used herein
    include inhibitory, activating, or modulating molecules, respectively, identified using in vitro
    and in vivo assays for binding or activity, e.g., ligands, agonists, antagonists, homologs, and
    mimetics thereof. The term "modulator" includes inhibitors and activators. Inhibitors are
 5  agents that, e.g., bind to a polypeptide and inhibit, partially or totally block stimulation or
    enzymatic activity, decrease, prevent, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or down
    regulate the activity of the polypeptide, e.g., antagonists. Activators are agents that, e.g., bind
    to, stimulate, increase, open, activate, facilitate, enhance activation or enzymatic activity,
    sensitize or up regulate the activity of a polypeptide, e.g., agonists. Modulators include
10  naturally-occurring and synthetic ligands, antagonists, agonists, small chemical molecules
    and the like.
    [00341    The term "isolated," when applied to a nucleic acid or protein, denotes that the
    nucleic acid or protein is essentially free of other cellular components with which it is
    associated in the natural state, It is preferably in a homogeneous state although it can be in
15  either a dry or aqueous solution. Purity and homogeneity are typically determined using
    analytical chemistry techniques such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or high
    performance liquid chromatography. A protein that is the predominant species present in a
    preparation is substantially purified. In particular, an isolated gene is separated from open
      eading frames that flank the gene and encode a protein other than the gene of interest. The
20  term "purified" denotes that a nucleic acid or protein gives rise to essentially one band in an
    electrophoretic gel. Particularly, it means that the nucleic acid or protein is at least 85% pure,
    at least 95% pure, or at least 99% pure.
     [0035]    The term "nucleic acid" or "polynucleotide" includes deoxyribonucleotides or
    ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. Unless
25  specifically limited, the term encompasses nucleic acids containing known analogues of
    natural nucleotides that have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are
    metabolized in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides. Unless otherwise
    indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively
    modified variants thereof (e.g,, degenerate codon substitutions), alleles, orthologs, SNPs, and
30  complementary sequences as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically,
    degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third
    position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or
    deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 19:5081 (1991); Ohtsuka et al., J

   Probes 8:91-98 (1994)). The term nucleic acid is used interchangeably with gene, cDNA,
   and mRNA encoded by a gene.
    [00361    The terms "polypeptide," "peptide," and "protein" are used interchangeably herein
 5 to include a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in
   which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding
   naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers and
   non-naturally occurring amino acid polymers. As used herein, the terms encompass amino
   acid chains of any length, including full-length proteins (i.e., antigens), wherein the amino
10  acid residues are linked by covalent peptide bonds.
    [00371     The term "amino acid" includes naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids, as
    well as amino acid analogs and amino acid minetics that function in a manner similar to the
    naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the
    genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified, e.g, hydroxyproline, y
15  carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs include compounds that have
    the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., an a carbon that is
    bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R- group, e.g, homoserine,
    norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine niethyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified
    R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical
20  structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. "Amino acid mimetics" include chemical
    compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an
    amino acid, but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid.
     [0038]    Amino acids may be referred to herein by either the commonly known three letter
    symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical
25  Nomenclature Commission. Nucleotides, likewise, may be referred to by their commnonily
    accepted single-letter codes.
     [0039]    "Conservatively modified variants" applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid
    sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, "conservatively modified
    variants" include those nucleic acids that encode identical or essentially identical amino acid
30   sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially
     identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of
     functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA,
                                                    9

   GCC, GCG and GICU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an
   alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons
   described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are "silent
   variations," which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid
 5  sequence herein that encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of
   the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG,
   which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only
   codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule.
   Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid that encodes a polypeptide is implicit in
10  each described sequence.
    [00401     As to amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognize that individual substitutions,
    deletions and/or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which
    alters, adds or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded
    sequence is a "conservatively modified variant" where the alteration results in the substitution
15  of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables
    providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. Such conservatively
    modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants, interspecies
    honologs, and/or alleles.
    [00411     The following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative
20  substitutions for one another:
    1)       Alanine (A), Glycine (G);
    2)       Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E);
    3)       Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q);
    4)       Arginine (R), Lysine (K);
25  5)       Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V);
    6)       Phenvialanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W);
    7)       Serine (S), Threonine (T); and
    8)       Cysteine (C), Methionine (M)
    (see, e.g., Creighton, Proteins (1984)),
30  [0042]     The term "recombinant" when used with reference, e.g., to a cell, or nucleic acid,
    protein, or vector, indicates that the cell, nucleic acid, protein or vector, has been modified by
    the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid or protein or the alteration of a native nucleic
                                                      10

    acid or protein, or that the cell is derived from a cell so modified. For example, recombinant
    cells express genes that are not found within the native (non-recombinant) form of the cell or
    express native genes that are otherwise abnormally expressed, under-expressed, or not
    expressed at all.
 5  [0043]     The term "heterologous" when used with reference to portions of a nucleic acid
    indicates that the nucleic acid comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the
    same relationship to each other in nature. For instance, the nucleic acid is typically
    recombinantly produced, having two or more sequences from unrelated genes arranged to
    make a new functional nucleic acid, e.g., a promoter from one source and a coding region
10  from another source. Similarly, a heterologous protein indicates that the protein comprises
    two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature
    (e.g., a fusion protein).
    10044]     An "expression vector" includes a nucleic acid construct, generated recombinantly
    or synthetically, with a series of specified nucleic acid elements that permit transcription of a
15  particular nucleic acid in a host cell. The expression vector can be part of a plasmid, virus, or
    nucleic acid fragment. Typically, the expression vector includes a nucleic acid to be
    transcribed operably linked to a promoter.
    100451     One who is "predisposed for a psychiatric or mental disorder" as used herein means
    a person who has an inclination or a higher likelihood of developing a psychiatric or mental
20  disorder when compared to an average person in the general population.
     [0046]    A "therapeutically effective amount" includes an amount or quantity effective, at
    dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic
    result,

    [00861     Each peptide (Z) may be connected to another peptide sequence by a chemical bond
    in a fusion protein or the amino acid sequences may be connected to each other through a
    linker group. In some embodiments, a peptide sequence may be formulated as an oligomer
    (multimer) of monomers, wherein each monomer comprises a peptide sequence as defined
25  above. In particular embodiments, multimeric peptides such as dendrimers may form
    conformational determinants or clusters due to the presence of multiple flexible peptide
    monomers. In one embodiment, the compound is a dimer. In another embodiment, the
    compound is a trimer or a tetramer, In one embodiment, the compound is a dendrimer, such

    carrying 4 peptides, 8 peptides, 16 peptides, or 32 peptides. Other carriers may be lipophilic

    dendrimers, or micelle-like carriers formed by lipophilic derivatives, or starburst (star-like)
    carbon chain polymer conjugates.
    [00871    In certain instances, a multimeric compound may be a polymer comprising two or

    1;88(1 0):2165-76.
15  V.      Preparation of Peptides of the Invention
    [00941    In some embodiments, the peptides of the invention (e.g., NCAM peptide mimetics)
    are produced by use of recombinant DNA technologies.
    [00951    In certain instances, the present invention relies on routinetechniques in the field of
    recombinant genetics. Basic texts disclosing the general methods of use in this invention
20  include Sambrook e al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (3rd ed. 2001); Kriegler,
    Gene Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory M4lanual (1990); and CurrentProtocols in
    MolecularBiology (Ausubel et al,, eds., 1994)).
    [00961    The DNA sequence encoding a peptide or the corresponding full-length protein
    from which the peptide originates may be prepared synthetically by established standard
25  methods, e.g., the phosphoamidine method described by Beaucage and Caruthers, 1981,

   WO 2013/184824                                                                 PCT/US2013/044342
    Tetrahedron Lett. 22:1859-1869, or the method described by Matthes et alb, 1984, EMBO J.
    3:801-805. According to the phosphoatnidine method, oligonucleotides are synthesised, e.g.,
    in an automatic DNA synthesiser, purified, annealed, ligated and cloned in suitable vectors.
    100971     The DNA sequence encoding a peptide may also be prepared by fragmentation of
 5 the DNA sequences encoding the corresponding full-length protein of peptide origin, using
    DNAase I according to a standard protocol (e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A
    Laboratory Manual (3rd ed. 2001)). The DNA encoding the full-length proteins of the
    invention may alternatively be fragmented using specific restriction endonucleases. The
    fragments of DNA can then be further purified using standard procedures described in, e.g.,
10  Sarnbrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A LaboratoryMtinual (3rd ed. 200 1).
    [0098]     The DNA sequence encoding a full-length protein may also be of genomic or cDNA
    origin, e.g., obtained by preparing a genomic or cDNA library and screening for DNA
    sequences coding for all or part of the full-length protein by hybridization using synthetic
    oligonucleotide probes in accordance with standard techniques (e.g., Sambrook et al., supra).
15  The DNA sequence may also be prepared by the polymerase chain reaction using specific
    primers, e.g., as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,683,202 and Saiki et al., 1988, Science
    239:487-491.
    100991     In certain embodiments, the DNA sequence is then inserted into a recombinant
    expression vector, which may be any vector, which may conveniently be subjected to
20  recombinant DNA procedures. The choice of vector may depend on the host cell into which
    it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, e.g., a
    vector that exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of
    chromosomal replication, e.g., a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when
    introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome and replicated together with
25  the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated.
    101001     In the vector, the DNA sequence encoding a peptide or a full-length protein should
    be operably connected to a suitable promoter sequence. The promoter may be any DNA
    sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived
    from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell. Non
30  limiting examples of suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the coding DNA
    sequence in mammalian cells include the SV 40 promoter (Subramani et al., 1981, Mol. Cell
    Biol. 1:854-864), the MT-1 (metallothionein gene) promoter (Palmiter et al., 1983, Science
                                                     23

   WO 2013/184824                                                               PCT/US2013/044342
    222: 809-8 14) and the adenovirus 2 najor late promoter. A suitable promoter for use in
    insect cells is the polyhedrin promoter (Vasuvedan et al., 1992, FEBS Lett. 311:7-11).
    Suitable promoters for use in yeast host cells include promoters from yeast glycolytic genes
    (Hitzeman et al, 1980, J. Biol. Chem, 255:12073-12080; Alber and Kawasaki, 1982, J. Mol.
 5  Appl. Gen. 1: 419-434) and alcohol dehydrogenase genes (Young et al., 1982, in Genetic
    Engineering of Microorganisms for Chemicals, Hollaender et al, eds., Plenum Press, New
    York), and the TPII (U.S. Patent No. 4,599,31 1) or ADI-12-4c (Russell et al, 1983, Nature
    304:652-654) promoters. Suitable promoters for use in filamentous fungus host cells include,
    but are not limited to, the ADH3 promoter (McKnight et al., 1985, EMBO J. 4:2093-2099)
10  and the tpiA promoter.
    [0101]     The coding DNA sequence may also be operably connected to a suitable terminator,
    such as the human growth hormone terminator (Pahniter et al., supra) or (for fungal hosts)
    the TI     (Alber and Kawasaki, supra) or ADH3 (McKnight et al., supra)promoters. The
    vector may further comprise elements such as polyadenylation signals (e.g., from SV 40 or
15  the adenovirus 5 Elb region), transcriptional enhancer sequences (e.g, the SV 40 enhancer),
    and translational enhancer sequences (e.g., the ones encoding adenovirus VA RNAs).
    [0102]     The recombinant expression vector may further comprise a DNA sequence enabling
    the vector to replicate in the host cell in question. An example of such a sequence (when the
    host cell is a mammalian cell) includes the SV 40 origin of replication. The vector may also
20  comprise a selectable marker, e.g., a gene the product of which complements a defect in the
    host cell, such as the gene coding for dihydrofolate reductase (DI-IFR) or one which confers
    resistance to a drug, e.g., neomycin, hydromycin or methotrexate.
    [01031     The procedures used to ligate the DNA sequences coding the peptides or full-length
    proteins, the promoter, and the terminator, respectively, and to insert them into suitable
25  vectors containing the information necessary for replication, are well known to persons
    skilled in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook el al., supra).
    [01041     To obtain recombinant peptides of the invention, the coding DNA sequences may be
    fused with a second peptide coding sequence and a protease cleavage site coding sequence,
    providing a DNA construct encoding the fusion protein, wherein the protease cleavage site
30  coding sequence positioned between the HBP fragment and second peptide coding DNA,

    [0105]     The host cell into which the expression vector is introduced may be any cell which
    is capable of expression of the peptides or full-length proteins, and is preferably a eukaryotic
    cell, such as invertebrate (insect) cells or vertebrate cells, e.g., Xenopus laevis oocytes or
    mammalian cells, in particular insect and mammalian cells. Examples of suitable mammalian
10  cell lines include, without limitation, the HEK293 (ATCC CRL- 1573), COS (ATCC CRL
    1650), BHK (ATCC CRL- 1632, ATCC CCL-10) and/or CHO (ATCC CCL-61) cell lines.
    Methods of transfecting mammalian cells and expressing DNA sequences introduced in the
    cells are described in, e.g., Kaufman and Sharp, J. Mol. Biol. 159, 1982, pp. 601-621;

    [0106]     In alternative embodiments, fungal cells (including yeast cells) may be used as host
    cells. Non-limiting examples of suitable yeast cells include cells of Saccharomyces spp. or
20  Schizosaccharomyces spp., in particular strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Examples of
    other fungal cells are cells of filamentous fungi, e.g Aspergills spp. or Neurosporaspp, in
    particular strains of Aspergillus oryzae or Aspergillns niger. The use of Aspergillus spp. for
    the expression of proteins is described in, e.g., EP 238 023.
    10107]     The medium used to culture the cells may be any conventional medium suitable for
25  growing mammalian cells, such as a serum-containing or serum-free medium containing
    appropriate supplements, or a suitable medium for growing insect, yeast or fungal cells.
    Suitable media are available from commercial suppliers or may be prepared according to
    published recipes (e.g., in catalogues of the American Type Culture Collection).
     [0108]    The peptides or full-length proteins recombinantly produced by the cells may then
30  be recovered from the culture medium by conventional procedures including separating the
    host cells from the medium by centrifugation or filtration, precipitating the proteinaceous
    components of the supernatant or filtrate by means of a. salt, e.g., ammonium sulfate, and/or

    purification by any of a variety of chromatographic procedures, e.g., HPLC, ion exchange
    chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like.
     [0109]    In other embodiments, the peptides of the invention (e.g., NCAM peptide rnimetics)
    are produced by use of synthetic production.
 5   [01101    Methods for synthetic production of peptides are well known in the art. Detailed
    descriptions as well as practical advice for producing synthetic peptides may be found in,
    e.g., Synthetic Peptides: A User's Guide (Advances in Molecular Biology), Grant G. A. ed.,
    Oxford University Press, 2002, and in Pharmaceutical Formulation: Development of Peptides
    and Proteins, Frokjaer and -ovgaard eds., Taylor and Francis, 1999.
10   [01111    In some embodiments, peptides may be synthesized by using Fmoc chemistry and
    with Acm-protected cysteines. After purification by reversed phase IPLC, peptides may be
    further processed to obtain, for example, cyclic or C- or N-terminal modified isoforms. The
    methods for cyclization and terminal modification are well-known in the art and described in
    detail in the above-cited manuals.
15  [01121     In other embodiments, peptides may be produced synthetically, in particular, by the
    Sequence Assisted Peptide Synthesis (SAPS) method.
    [01131     In certain embodiments. peptides may be synthesized either batchwise in a
    polyethylene vessel equipped with a polypropylene filter for filtration or in the continuous
    flow version of the polyamide solid-phase method (Dryland, A. and Sheppard, R. C., (1986)
20  J. Chem. Soc. Perkin T'rans. I, 125-137) on a fully automated peptide synthesizer using 9
    fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) or tert-butyloxycarbonyl, (Boc) as N-a-amino protecting
    group and suitable common protection groups for side-chain functionalities.
    VIL     Purification of Peptides of the Invention
    [01141     The peptides of the invention may be purified to substantial purity by standard
25  techniques, including selective precipitation with such substances as ammonium sulfate;
    column chromatography, immunopurification methods, and others (see, e.g., Scopes, Protein
    Purification:Principlesand Practice (1982); U.S. Patent No. 4,6713,641; Ausubel et al,
    sutpra; and Sambrook et al., supra).
    [0115]     A number of procedures can be employed when recombinant peptides are purified.
30  For example, proteins having established molecular adhesion properties can be reversible
    fused to recombinant peptides. With the appropriate ligand, the peptides can be selectively
                                                    26

    adsorbed to a purification column and then freed from the column in a relatively pure form.
    The fused protein is then removed by enzymatic activity. Finally, the peptide can be purified
    using immunoaffinity columns.
    [0116]      The purification of proteins from recombinant bacteria as well as standard protein
 5  separation techniques for purifying proteins (e.g, solubility fractionation, size differential
    filtration, column chromatography, etc.) are well known in the art and are described in, e.g.,
    U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009/0019557, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by
    reference its entirety for alI purposes.
    VIL       Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions
10  [0117]      In certain aspects, the peptides of the invention (e.g., NCAM peptide mimetics) are
    administered directly to a mammalian subject (e.g., human). Administration is by any of the
    routes normally used for introducing a compound into contact with a tissue to be treated and
    is well known to those of skill in the art. Although more than one route can be used to
    administer a particular composition, a particular route can often provide a more immediate
15  and more effective reaction than another route.
     [0118]     In some embodiments, the peptides of the present invention (e.g., NCAM peptide
      n imetics) can be combined with other drugs useful for treating neurological conditions or
    symptoms thereof. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present
     invention may comprise an NCAM peptide mimetic combined with at least one additional
20  compound useful for neurological conditions or symptoms thereof, such as those described
     in, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,297,262; 6,284,760; 6,284,771; 6,232,326; 6,187,752; 6,117,890;
     6,239,162 or 6,166,008.
     [0119]     The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may comprise a pharmaceutically
     acceptable carrier. In certain aspects, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are determined in
25   part by the particular composition being administered, as well as by the particular method
     used to administer the composition. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable
     formulations of pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention (see, e.g., REMNGTON'
     1   P     CEUTICAL SCiENCES, 1SFi ED., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA (1990)).
     [0120]      The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered in a manner
30   compatible with the dosage formulation, and in such amount as will be therapeutically
     effective. The quantity to be administered depends on a variety of factors including, e.g., the
                                                       27

    age, body weight, physical activity, and diet of the subject, the mental disorder to be treated,
    and the stage or severity of the mental disorder. In certain embodiments, the size of the dose
    may also be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side effects that
    accompany the administration of a particular compound in a particular subject. In general,
 5  the dose equivalent of a compound of the invention is from about 1 ng/kg to about 10 mg/kg
    for a typical subject.
    [01211     In certain embodiments, the dose may take the form of solid, semi-solid, lyophilized
    powder, or liquid dosage forms, such as, for example, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules,
    powders, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, suppositories, retention enemas, creams,
10  ointments, lotions, gels, aerosols, foams, or the like, preferably in unit dosage forms suitable
    for simple administration of precise dosages.
    10122]     In the practice of this invention, the compositions can be administered, for example,
    orally, nasally, by inhalation, topically, intravenously, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally,
     intrathecallv, and/or intracerebroventricularly.
15  [01231     As used herein, the term "unit dosage form" refers to physically discrete units
    suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a
    predetermined quantity of a peptide calculated to produce the desired onset, tolerability,
    and/or therapeutic effects, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient (e.g., an
    ampoule). In addition, more concentrated dosage forms may be prepared, from which the
20  more dilute unit dosage forms may then be produced. The more concentrated dosage forms
    thus will contain substantially more than, e.g. at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more
    times the amount of the peptide.
    [0124]     Methods for preparing such dosage forms are known to those skilled in the art (see,
    e.g., REMIN'GION 's PHARMACEUTICAL SCNCES,           8TH ED., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA
25  (1990)). The dosage forms typically include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or
    excipient and may additionally include other medicinal agents, carriers, adjuvants, diluents,
    tissue permeation enhancers, solubilizers, and the like. Appropriate excipients can be tailored
    to the particular dosage form and route of administration by methods well known in the art
    (see, e.g., RFAWNGTON'S PHARACEUTJCAL SCIENCES, supra).
30  10125]     Examples of suitable excipients include, but are not limited to, lactose, dextrose,
    sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth,
    gelatin, calcium silicate, mnicrocrystal line cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water,

    saline, syrup, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylnethylcellulose, and polyacrylic
    acids such as Carbopols, e.g., Carbopol 941, Carbopol 980, Carbopol 981, etc. The dosage
    forms can additionally include lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and
    mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying agents; suspending agents; preserving agents such as
 5  methyl-, ethyl--, and propyl-hydroxy-benzoates (i.e., the parabens); pH adjusting agents such
    as inorganic and organic acids and bases; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The
    dosage forms may also comprise biodegradable polymer beads, dextran, and cyclodextrin
    inclusion complexes.
    [0126]     For oral administration, the therapeutically effective dose can be in the form of
10  tablets, capsules, emulsions, suspensions, solutions, syrups, sprays, lozenges, powders, and
    sustained-release formulations. Suitable excipients for oral administration include
    pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine,
    talcum, cellulose, glucose, gelatin, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like.
    [01271     In sone embodiments, the therapeutically effective dose takes the form of a pill,
15  tablet, or capsule, and thus, the dosage form can contain, along with a peptide described
    herein, any of the following: a diluent such as lactose, sucrose, dicalcium phosphate, and the
    like; a disintegrant such as starch or derivatives thereof; a lubricant such as magnesium
    stearate and the like; and a binder such a starch, gum acacia, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin,
    cellulose and derivatives thereof. A peptide can also be formulated into a suppository
20  disposed, for example, in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) carrier.
    [01281     Liquid dosage forms can be prepared by dissolving or dispersing a peptide and
    optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants in a carrier such as, for
    example, aqueous saline (e.g. 0.9% w/v sodium chloride), aqueous dextrose, glycerol,
    ethanol, and the like, to form a solution or suspension, e.g., for oral, topical, or intravenous
25  administration. A peptide can also be formulated into a retention enema.
     [01291    For topical administration, the therapeutically effective dose can be in the form of
    emulsions, lotions, gels, foams, creams, jellies, solutions, suspensions, ointments, and
    transdermal patches. For administration by inhalation, a peptide can be delivered as a dry
    powder or in liquid form via a nebulizer. Aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized
30  acceptable propellants such as dichlorodifluoromethane. For parenteral administration, the
    therapeutically effective dose can be in the form of sterile injectable solutions and sterile
                                                     29

    packaged powders. Preferably, injectable solutions are formulated at a pH of from about 4.5
    to about 7.5.
    [0130]     The therapeutically effective dose can also be provided in a lyophilized form. Such
    dosage forms may include a buffer, e.g., bicarbonate, for reconstitution prior to
 5  administration, or the buffer may be included in the lyophilized dosage form for
    reconstitution with, e.g., water. The lyophilized dosage form may further comprise a suitable
    vasoconstrictor, e.g., epinephrine. The lyophilized dosage form can be provided in a syringe,
    optionally packaged in combination with the buffer for reconstitution, such that the
    reconstituted dosage form can be immediately administered to a subject.
10  VIIL     Example
    [0131]     It is understood that the example and embodiments described herein are for
    illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be
    suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of
    this application and scope of the appended claims.
15  Example 1. Pharmacological Studies with NCAM Peptide Mimetics.
    101321     This example demonstrates the effects of the administration of NCAM peptide
    mimetics such as FGL,,           FGLFGLS, and plannexin on anxiety and depression in an animal
    model system.
    FGL
20  [0133]     The NCAM peptide mimetic FGLm, (5 pg) or vehicle was administered
    intracerebroventricularly (i.e.v.) to adult rats. Figure 1 shows that administration of FGL,
    decreased depression, e.g., produced an antidepressant-like effect, as measured by the forced
    swim test (FST). In particular, animals receiving FGLm exhibited significantly more
    swimming and less immobility compared to vehicle controls.
25  FGL
    [01341     The NCAM peptide mimetic FGLL (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg) or control was
    administered subcutaneously (s.c.) to adult rats. For the elevated plus maze (EPM), which
    measures anxiety-like behavior, animals were injected 30 minutes before the test. For the
    FST, which measures depression-like behavior, animals were injected I hour and 5 hours
30  after Day I and 30 minutes before Day 2. Figure 2 shows a dose-response curve for FGL, in
    which higher doses of the peptide mimetic significantly increased the time the animals spent
                                                      30

   WO 2013/184824                                                                  PCT/US2013/044342
    in the "Closed" parts of the EPM. As such, administration of FGLL increased anxiety, e.g.,
    produced an anxiogenic effect, as measured by the EPM in an animal model system.
    101351     FGL, (10 mg/kg, s.c.) or control was also administered to adult rats via injection
    ever' 24 hours for 16 days. Animals were tested for locomotion on Day 13, tested for
 5  anxiety-like behavior with the EPM on Day 14, tested for depression-like behavior with the
    FST on Days 15 and 16, and sacrificed on Day 17. Figure 3 illustrates that FGLL
    administration decreased depression, e.g., produced an antidepressant-like effect, as measured
    by the FST. In particular, animals receiving FGLL exhibited significantly more climbing and
    less immobility when compared to controls.
10  FGLs
    [01361     The NCAM peptide mimetic FGLs or vehicle (."VEH") was administered
    subcutaneously (s.c.) to adult rats and the effect on depression-like behavior was measured by
    the forced swim test (FST). Animals received 5 injections of 10 mg/kg FGLs or vehicle
    separated by 1 hour, starting 1 hour after the Day 1 swim. Animals were then given one
15  injection of 10 tg/kg FGLs or vehicle 30 minutes before the Day 2 test. Figure 4 shows that
    administration of FGLs decreased depression, e.g., produced an antidepressant-like effect, as
    measured by the FST. In particular, animals receiving FGLs exhibited significantly more
    swimming (p < 0.05) and less immobility (p < 0.005) compared to vehicle controls. These
    results illustrate that FGLs administration had a statistically significant effect on depression
20  like behavior.
    [0137]     FGLs or vehicle was also administered subcutaneously by an osmotic minipump to
    adult rats and the effect on depression was measured by the forced swim test (FST). Animals
    received a total of 12 mg/day of FGLs. The animals were tested for depression-like behavior
    in the FST on Day 16. As shown in Figure 5, administration of FGLs decreased depression,
25  e.g., produced an antidepressant-like effect, as measured by the FST. In particular, animals
    receiving FGLs exhibited significantly less immobility (p<0.05) compared to vehicle
    controls. These results show that FGLs administration had a statistically significant effect on
    depression.
    Plannexin
30  [0138]     The NCAM peptide mimetic plannexin (10 mg/kg) or vehicle control was acutely
    administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to adult rats. Figure 6 shows that acute administration of
    plannexin significantly increased the time animals spent in the "Closed" parts of the EPM.
                                                     31

   WO 2013/184824                                                                  PCT/US2013/044342
    As such, acute administration of plannexin increased anxiety, e.g., produced an anxiogenic
    effect, as measured by the EPM in an animal model system.
    [0139]     Plannexin (10 mg/kg, ip.) or control was also chronically administered to adult rats
    via injection every 48 hours on odd days. Animals were tested for locomotion on Day 13,
 5  tested for anxiety-like behavior with the EPM on Day 14, tested for depression-like behavior
    with the FST on Days 15 and 16, and sacrificed on Day 17. Figure 7 illustrates that chronic
    administration of plannexin significantly decreased the time animals spent in the "Closed"
    parts of the EPM and significantly increased the time animals spent in the "Center" of the
    EPM. As such, chronic administration of plannexin decreased anxiety, e.g., produced an
10  anxiolytic effect, as measured by the EPM in an animal model system.
