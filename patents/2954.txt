Product description
       The Roof Scoop is roof cross ventilation system. The scoop itself is made of either
colorbond steel, stainless steel or copper and is custom made to fit each tile profile. A
single roof tile is removed and replaced by a single roof scoop. The scoop is fastened
securely to the timber batten and /or rafter. There are 2 roof scoops included in each
system. One is the input scoop and the other is the output scoop. It is the first countersunk
roof ventilation system. The scoop has a minimum slope of 12 degrees and a 20mm turn
up at the rear to prevent water from entering the roof space during strong wind forced
rain. The scoop also has strong mesh to prevent wildlife from entering. The output scoop
utilises either a 120mm or 2x 90mm fans, 12AH battery pack, battery controller / charger
and a 40W solar panel.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Specification and performance
FAN:
The fan used in the output roof scoop has a minimum airflow of 95 CFM at 2000 RPM and a 160,000 hour life
expectancy. It has a noise level of 36 dBA at full capacity.
SOLAR CHARGING CONTROLLER:
The output scoop utilises a 12V/DC 6A/1 A solar charging controller. The unit allows the solar panel to charge
the battery and switch power usage from the battery to the solar panel.
BATTERY:
The output scoop is powered by a deep cycle 12V 9AH battery. The deep cycle is not damaged when the
battery goes completely flat. The battery is capable of powering the fan for over 10 hours without the
assistance of the solar panel.
SOLAR PANEL:
The output scoop is charged and powered by a 12V, 40W solar panel. It has a max power voltage of 17.2V
and a current of 2.33A at max power. This Panel is able to fully charge the battery and run the fan within 8
hours on a sunny day.
INPUT ROOF SCOOP;
The roof scoop is custom made for each roof. It is made of bluescope steel and comes in a range of colours.
It allows fresh air to enter the roof space. It has a 20mm upturn at the rear and is slopped at a minimum slope
of 11 degrees, preventing water from entering. It includes a mesh wall to prevent wildlife and wildlife from
entering.
Claims
One set (input and output scoop) can extract a minimum of of 95 cubic feet per minute. This number increases
when wind enters through the input vent. The system is designed to create cross ventilation within the roof
space and this can only happen when there is an input and an output vent. This results in a reduction of roof
space temperature and reduces the dampness within the roof space. The scoop is completely watertight due
to its custom made fit. The mesh prevents wildlife entering through the scoop
