10                                           BACKGROUND
                          Platforms, such as vehicle frames, are subject to twisting, i.e., being forced
   into a condition in which the platform is no longer planar or otherwise in its normal
   configuration, e.g., the condition of a platform as it exists when no external forces are acting
   upon it. Platforms may experience twist when uneven loads are applied to various areas of the
15 platform. For example, the frame of a recreational vehicle may twist as the vehicle is being
   leveled relative to earth gravity by a plurality of supporting jacks. The jacks may impart twist to
   a recreational vehicle frame when they are driven to displace, by differing amounts, respective
   portions of the frame they are supporting
                                                SUMMARY

                                                 -4
                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
                          The apparatus and method disclosed herein can be used to mitigate twist
   in various platforms, such as recreational vehicle frames, by using sensors to detect platform
   twist and to then mitigate the platform twist by operatingjacks. Platform twist may be induced
 5 by uneven load distribution caused by forces applied to the platform by supported loads and/or
   by jacks actuated in a leveling process. For example, if a user of a recreational vehicle (RV)
   desires to level a kitchen countertop of an RV that includes a platform carrying a plurality of
   jacks, the user can operate the jacks to move the RV platform into a desired attitude in which
   the countertop is level. Tilt sensor signals corresponding to the desired platform attitude can
10 be saved and, thereafter, if the countertop is out-of-level due to relocation of the RV or
   settling, a user can return the platform to the desired attitude (with the RV kitchen countertop
   level) by initiating an automatic leveling sequence that drives the RV platform back to the
   desired attitude. However, as the jacks drive the RV platform into the desired attitude, the
   jacks may induce twist into the RV platform. The apparatus and method provided herein can
15 detect and continuously monitor such platform twist and, upon the determination that the
   platform twist exceeds a threshold value, can either initiate or modify jack operation to
   mitigate the platform twist.
                          With reference to Figure 1, a platform twist mitigation apparatus 1 is
   provided for detecting and mitigating twist in a platform 10, such as a vehicle frame. The
20 platform twist apparatus 1 may include a plurality of jacks 40 (42-48; jack 46 is underneath
   the right-rear comer of the platform and, thus, is not in view in Figure 1) or may be retrofit to
   operate jacks already installed on a platform. The platform twist apparatus 1 may be operable to
   extend the jacks 42-48 into engagement with a surface 2, such as the ground, that is disposed
   below the platform 10, and may be independently operable to alternately extend and retract the
25 jacks 42-48 to change platform attitude relative to the surface 2, such as changing the platform
   attitude from a twisted condition to a planar or normal, untwisted condition.

                                                   -5
                          The platform mitigation apparatus 1 may also include a first tilt sensor 32
   that is supported at a first location 12 on the platform 10 and a second tilt sensor 34 that is
   supported at a second location 14 on the platform 10 spaced from the first location 12. The tilt
   sensors 32, 34 may be constructed and/or programmed to detect, relative to the direction of
 5 earth's gravitational force, angles 01 and     02, respectively, between respective portions of the
   platform at the first location 12 and the second location 14 and a reference plane such as an earth
   gravity-level plane. The first angle 0i may be measured between a first gravity reference line 16
   in the reference plane, and a first platform reference line 17 that runs along a platform surface
   between rear jacks 42 and 44. The second angle       02 may be measured between a second gravity
10 reference line 18 in the reference plane, and second platform reference line 19 that runs along a
   platform surface between front jacks 46 and 48, as shown in Figure 1. Also, tilt sensor signals
   representing the first angle 01 may be used to inform the ECM 50 of a platform attitude in the
   area of the first position 12 and tilt sensor signals representing the second angle 02 may be used
   to inform the ECM 50 of a platform attitude in the area of the second position 14.
15                        Platform 10 may comprise any structure subject to twist and any suitable
   material or combination of materials, including metal and metal alloys (including steel and
   steel alloys), plastics and/or other polymers, and/or various other solid materials. Platform 10
   can be a vehicle frame or base platform that is constructed from carbon steel, aluminum alloy,
   or other metal alloy or steel material. In addition, or alternatively, various plastics and/or
20 polymers can be used, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET or PETE), high-density
   polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), and various others.
   Although Figure 1 depicts platform 10 as having a rectangular shape, the platform may
   include any one or more suitable shapes to include a frame or framework. Moreover, in some
   embodiments, the platform 10 may be or comprise a vehicle frame, e.g., the frame of a motor
25 home or recreational vehicle or a recreational vehicle trailer.
                           Figure 3 shows electronics 20 of the platform mitigation apparatus 1,
   including the plurality of jacks 40, the tilt sensors 32, 34, an electronic control module (ECM)
   50, a power source 60, and input 90. The dashed lines represent data connections between the

   P-5233.3022.004/LCI/IDS
                                                  -6
   components to which the lines connect and the solid lines represent electronic power lines
   between the components to which the lines connect. The ECM 50 may include a non
   transitory computer-readable memory that includes platform twist mitigation instructions that
   operate so as to mitigate and/or prevent platform twist. The platform twist mitigation
 5 instructions can be configured such that, when executed, the method 300 (Figures 4A-B) is
   carried out. Although the platform twist mitigation apparatus 1 is discussed below as
   including various components including the jacks and platform, the platform twist mitigation
   apparatus 1 may instead comprise sensor and electronic control components to be retrofit onto
   a platform and connected to jacks carried by the platform.
10                         The plurality of jacks 40 can include four jacks 42-48 located at the
   comers of the platform 10. For example, jack 42 can be referred to as the left-rear jack, jack
   44 can be referred to as the right-rear jack, jack 46 can be referred to as the left-front jack, and
   jack 48 can be referred to as the right-front jack.
                           Each jack 42-48 of the plurality of jacks 40 can be electronically
15 operable and controlled by ECM 50 through sending jack control signals to each of the jacks
   42-48. Each jack 42-48 can be any device that can extend or retract a piston or arm through
   use of, for example, pneumatic power and/or electric power. Moreover, the jacks 42-48 may
   be controllable relative to one another and, also, can be operable in sets, such as: a front jack
   pair that includes left-front jack 46 and right-front jack 48, a rear jack pair that includes left
20 rear jack 42 and right-rear jack 44, a left jack pair that includes left-rear jack 42 and left-front
   jack 46, and a right jack pair that includes right-rear jack 44 and right-front jack 48. As
   described in more detail below, the rear jack pair can be used to adjust the first angle 01 and
   the front jack pair can be used to adjust the second angle     02. In other embodiments, more tilt
   sensors can be placed on the platform 10 for use in twist detection and mitigation. For example,
25 a third tilt sensor can be placed between left-rear jack 42 and left-front jack 46 and a fourth tilt
   sensor can be placed between right-rear jack 44 and right-front jack 48. In such an embodiment,
   the third sensor may be used to read a third angle 03 and the fourth sensor may be used to read a
   fourth angle 04.

                                                   -7
                           Each jack 42-48 of the plurality of jacks 40 may include a position sensor
   72-78 and a direct current motor 82-88. The position sensors 72-78 can be located and
   configured to sense the positions ofjack piston or other jack component to determine the amount
   of jack extension in respective jacks 42-48. The DC motors 82-88 of each ofthejacks 42-48 can
 5 be used to actuate their respective jacks between respective fully retracted positions and fully
   extended positions. For example, jack 42 may include a sensor 72 and a DC motor 82, jack 44 a
   sensor 74 and a DC motor 84, jack 46 a sensor 76 and a DC motor 86, and jack 48 a sensor 78
   and a DC motor 88, as shown in Figure 2. The jacks 42-48 may be configured to receive
   respective extension signals that command the jacks 42-48 to use their respective DC motors 82
10 88 to extend the jacks 42-48. Likewise, the jacks 42-48 may be configured to receive respective
   retraction signals that command the jacks to use their respective DC motors 82-88 to retract the
   jacks.
                           One or both of the tilt sensors 32, 34 shown in Figures 1-3 may also serve
   as tilt sensors whose outputs may be used by the ECM 50 to drive the attitude of the platform
15 into a desired attitude. As used herein, the term "tilt sensor" refers to a sensor configured to
   detect tilt angle relative to earth gravity. Either sensor 32, 24 may be a dual axis tilt sensor
   configured to detect tilt about two orthogonal axes, e.g., pitch and roll, relative to earth gravity.
   In accordance with this tilt sensor function, one or both sensors 32, 34 may be configured to
   generate and provide digital and/or analog tilt sensor signals to the ECM 50. In the case of
20 sending analog signals to the ECM 50, the ECM 50 may include an analog to digital converter to
   obtain sensor values in a digitized form.
                           The power source 60 may provide direct current or alternating current to
   the components of the platform mitigation apparatus 1. The power source 60 may include a
   battery, such as a lead-acid, lithium ion, or one or more of a variety of other types of batteries,
25 including any of the various lithium or nickel based batteries known to those skilled in the art.
   Where alternating current (AC) is provided, the ECM 50 may include an AC/DC (alternating
   current/direct current) converter (i.e., rectifier). In some embodiments, the power source 60
   may be included in a vehicle, such as a recreational vehicle, and, in such cases, the power

   P-5233.3022.004/LCI/IDS
                                                -8
   source 60 may be coupled to an alternator that may derive power from a rotational force from
   a shaft that may be driven by an engine or motor, such as an internal combustion engine. In
   other embodiments, the power source 60 may be connected to an electric power line that is
   used to provide a means to receive electric power from a power plant or other power
 5 generating means. As shown in Figure 1, the power source 60 may be used to provide
   electrical power to ECM 50, tilt sensors 32 and 34, and jacks 42-48.
                          User inputs 90 may include a plurality of human-machine interfacing
   devices and/or components. For example, user inputs 90 may include a plurality of
   pushbuttons, each of which may operate one of the plurality of jacks 40. Additionally, or
10 alternatively, the user inputs 90 may include a touchscreen that includes a graphical user
   interface (GUI) and/or a microphone that can be used in conjunction with an automated
   speech recognition (ASR) system. Various other human-machine interfaces may be used.
                          The platform twist mitigation apparatus 1 may also include the ECM 50
   which may be a micro controller-based electronic control module (ECM) (Figure 3). The ECM
15 50 may include computer-readable platform twist mitigation instructions 56 (Figure 3) that,
   when executed, cause the ECM 50 to detect a platform twist condition in response to receiving
   angle data from the first tilt sensor 32 and/or the second tilt sensor 34. The ECM 50 may
   additionally or alternatively be programmed to mitigate the platform twist condition by operating
   or modifying the operation of one or more jacks 42-48 of the plurality ofjacks 40.
20                        In one embodiment, the ECM 50 may be programmed to modify the
   operation of one or more of the jacks 42-48 by restricting the operation of one or more of the
   jacks 42-48. The ECM 50 may additionally or alternatively be programmed to restrict the
   operation of one or more of the jacks 42-48 by stopping or preventing the operation of one or
   more of the jacks 42-48 for a predetermined time period, or by slowing one or more of the jacks
25 42-48 for a predetermined time period, i.e. by scheduling the deceleration of jack extension or
   retraction and/or by scheduling a slower speed ofjack extension or retraction.

                                                 -9
                          In other embodiments, the ECM 50 may be programmed to differentially
   modify the operation of one or more of the jacks 42-48 by augmenting the operation of one or
   more of the jacks 42-48. The ECM 50 may be programmed to augment the operation of one or
   more of the jacks 42-48 by initiating the operation, e.g., the extension or retraction of one or
 5 more of the jacks 42-48 for a predetermined time period, or by speeding-up one or more of the
   jacks 42-48 for a predetermined time period, e.g., by scheduling the acceleration of jack
   extension or retraction and/or by scheduling a faster speed ofjack extension or retraction.
                          Also, according to some embodiments, the ECM 50 may be programmed
   to adjust or modify jack operation in response to feedback, i.e., in response to changing angle
10 data received from the first sensor 32 and/or the second sensor 34 during an untwisting process
   or a platform twist mitigation process. The ECM 50 may also be programmed to continue
   modifying jack operation under feedback control until the angle data received from the first tilt
   sensor 32 matches angle data received from the second tilt sensor 34, or at least until the first tilt
   sensor data and the second tilt sensor data indicate that the amount of twist, which can be
15 interpreted as an absolute difference between 01 and 02 (amount of twist 0A= 01 - 021), is below
   a threshold amount or a maximum allowable amount Omx-simply stated when OA < Om.
                          The first sensor 32 and/or second sensor 34 may be constructed or
   configured to transmit, and the ECM 50 constructed to receive, angle data via electromagnetic
   energy. In other embodiments, the first sensor 32 and second sensor 34 may transmit angle data
20 to the ECM 50 by any other suitable data transmission medium, with or without the use of wires
   or other suitable current paths. This may include the use of short-range wireless communication
   (SRWC) technologies, including Bluetooth TM, Wi-Fi, ZigBeeTM , and other suitable SRWC
   technologies.
                          The first sensor 32 and/or second sensor 34 may be carried by the platform
25 on opposite sides or opposite ends of the platform, such as at spaced apart positions 12 and 14 as
   shown in Figure 1. The ECM 50 may be carried by the platform 10 on a front end of the platform

   P-5233.3022.004/LCI/IDS
                                                   -   10
   along with one of the sensors, in which case a remote second sensor would be carried by the
   platform at an aft end of the platform.
                            The ECM 50 may be programmed to mitigate the platform twist condition
   while the jacks 42-48 are being operated to re-orient the platform 10 to a desired attitude such as
 5 gravity level, i.e., such as an attitude in which the platform is oriented perpendicular to the
   direction of gravitational force of Earth, or are being operated to otherwise adjust the attitude of
   the platform 10. To accomplish this, the ECM 50 may be programmed to actively restrict one or
   more of the jacks 42-48 "on the fly" while the jacks 50 are being operated to level or otherwise
   adjust the attitude of the platform 10. The ECM 50 may be programmed to restrict the operation
10 of one or more of the jacks 42-48 by stopping or preventing the operation one or more of the
   jacks 42-48 for a predetermined time period, or by slowing one or more of the jacks 42-48 for a
   predetermined time period.
                            In addition, or alternatively, the ECM 50 may be programmed to mitigate
   platform twist during an automatic platform attitude adjustment operation by actively
15 augmenting the operation of one or more of the jacks 42-48 "on the fly". Active augmentation
   may be accomplished by programming or configuring the ECM 50 to operate one or more of the
   jacks 42-48 by initiating the extension or retraction of one or more of the jacks 42-48 for a
   predetermined time period, or by speeding-up one or more of the jacks 42-48 for a
   predetermined time period, i.e., by scheduling the acceleration of jack extension or retraction
20 and/or a faster speed of jack extension or retraction.
                            The ECM 50 may be programmed or configured to adjust its modification
   of jack operation, in response to feedback, e.g., in response to changing angle data received from
   the first sensor 32 and/or the second sensor 34 during the untwisting process. The ECM 50 may
   be programmed to continue this feedback-controlled jack operation modification until the angle
25 data received from the first tilt sensor 32 matches angle data received from the second tilt sensor
   34, or at least until the first angle 01 and the second angle 02 indicate that the amount of twist OA
   is below a threshold amount or a maximum allowable amount 0ma.

                           For calibration purposes, the ECM 50 may be programmed to enter a zero
   mode in which the ECM 50 recognizes signal values currently being received from the tilt
   sensors 30 as representing a desired platform twist value to be sought in future twist correction
   operations. These calibration signal values that are received from tilt sensors 30 may be saved in
 5 EEPROM or other memory 54. The ECM 50 may be programmed to enter the zero mode for
   calibration purposes when power from power supply 60 is first applied to the controller 50.
                           As mentioned above, the platform 10 may comprise a vehicle frame, e.g.,
   the frame of a motor home or recreational vehicle or a recreational vehicle trailer. In practice,
   the detection and mitigation of twist in a platform such as a vehicle frame may be accomplished
10 by first either providing a platform 10 carrying a plurality of jacks 40 or supporting a plurality of
   jacks 40 on a platform 10, the jacks being independently operable to extend into engagement
   with a surface 2 below the platform 10 and also being independently operable to alternately
   extend and retract to change platform attitude relative to the surface 2. A first angle or tilt sensor
   32 and a second angle or tilt sensor 34 may then be supported at respective first and second
15 locations 12, 14, on the platform 10 such that the sensors 32 and 34 are spaced apart-for
   example, at forward and aft ends of the platform 10. At least one, and preferably all jacks 42-48
   of the plurality of jacks 40 may then be extended into engagement with a surface 2 below the
   platform 10. Any platform twist condition may then be mitigated by differentially modifying the
   operation of one or more jacks 42-48 of the plurality of j acks 40 by restricting and/or augmenting
20 the operation of one or more of the jacks 42-48 as one or more of the jacks 42-48 are being
   operated to adjust the attitude of at least a portion of the platform 10 relative to the direction of
   the gravitational force of Earth.
                           A platform twist mitigation apparatus 1 comprising the ECM 50 and tilt
   sensors 30, as disclosed above, may be calibrated by first providing the apparatus 1 on platform
25  10, then changing platform twist to a desired platform twist value by operating the jacks 40 as
   required to provide the desired platform twist value, and then causing the ECM 50 to enter a zero
   mode in which the ECM 50 recognizes signal values currently being received from the tilt
   sensors 30 as representing a desired platform twist value to be sought in future twist correction

                                                - 12
   operations. The desired platform twist value may preferably, but not necessarily, be a zero
   platform twist value. The ECM 50 may also be programmed to recognize the signal values
   currently being received from the tilt sensors 30 as also indicating that a selected portion of the
   platform is in a desired attitude to be sought in future platform attitude adjustment/twist
 5 correction operations.
                          The ECM 50 may be programmed to enter the zero mode when power is
   first applied to the ECM 50 via, for example, the power source 60. If so, entry of the ECM 50
   into the zero mode may include applying electrical power to the platform twist mitigation
   apparatus 1 after having changed platform twist to a desired platform twist value.
10                        The platform twist mitigation apparatus 1 may include a zero mode
   indicator 70 configured to indicate when the ECM 50 is in the zero mode and ready to receive tilt
   sensor signal values representing desired platform attitude and/or twist. If the apparatus 1
   includes such a zero mode indicator 70, then entry of the ECM 50 into zero mode will cause the
   zero mode indicator to indicate to an operator that the ECM 50 is, in fact, in the zero mode and
15 ready for calibration inputs.
                          The platform twist mitigation apparatus 1 may be calibrated to recognize
   when platform 10 is within an acceptable range of platform twist values, rather than recognizing
   only a single desired platform twist value. The ECM 50 may be programmed to include a zero
   mode in which the ECM 50 will recognize signal values being received from the apparatus tilt
20 sensors 30 as indicating that a selected portion of the platform 10 is in a desired attitude and
   representing a platform twist value, e.g., a median platform twist value, within a range of
   platform twist values that the ECM 50 is to recognize as acceptable in future twist mitigation
   operations. In other words, when an input is provided to the ECM 50 indicating that the current
   set of signal values being received from the tilt sensors 30 is the set of signal values that the
25 ECM 50 is to recognize as representing a desired platform twist value, the ECM 50 recognizes
   that desired twist value as being just one value within a predetermined range of acceptable
   platform twist values for the ECM 50 to reference in future platform twist mitigation operations.

                                                - 13
   The ECM 50 may be programmed to center the predetermined range of acceptable platform twist
   values on the one desired platform twist value, and may, for example, be programmed to
   recognize as acceptable a range of platform twist values within plus or minus 0.25 degrees of the
   desired platform twist value.
 5                        The platform twist detection and mitigation apparatus 1 and method
   disclosed below allows for mitigation of platform twist "on-the-fly" at the same time that the
   platform is being leveled, and using the same jacks used to level the platform, as will be
   apparent from the description of method 300 below.
                          As mentioned above, Figure 1 shows a perspective view of an illustrative
10 embodiment of the platform twist mitigation apparatus 1 in a twisted configuration, and Figure 2
   shows a perspective view of an illustrative embodiment of a platform twist mitigation apparatus
   in a non-twisted configuration. Figures 1 and 2 will be used as a reference in describing the
   method 300 (Figures 4A-B) below.
                          Figures 4A and 4B depict a flow chart showing a method 300 of detecting
15 and mitigating twist in a platform. The method 300 may be carried out by the platform
   mitigation apparatus 1 through use of the ECM 50. The platform twist mitigation apparatus 1
   may include platform twist mitigation instructions 56 that are stored in memory 54 and that may
   be executed by processing device 52. The platform twist mitigation instructions 56 may be
   executed upon the initiation of a platform attitude adjustment, e.g., a leveling process, in which
20 the platform 10 is automatically re-oriented to a desired attitude, such as gravity level, using the
   ECM 50 to control jacks 42-48. During the leveling process, various factors may cause the
   platform to begin to twist (i.e., to begin to take on a platform twist condition). By using the
   platform twist mitigation instructions 56, which may be configured to implement the method
   300 discussed below, platform twist imparted by the platform attitude adjustment process may
25 be avoided and/or mitigated. In other embodiments, a user may operate jacks 42-48 manually
   and, during such operation, the platform twist mitigation instructions 56 may be executed such
   that platform twist is avoided and/or mitigated. The operation ofjacks 42-48 and/or the initiation

   P-5233.3022.004/LCI/IDS
                                                - 14
   of the automatic platform attitude adjustment process may be performed through a user operating
   inputs 90, which may be entered via one or more pushbuttons, a touchscreen display, or other
   human-machine interface.
                          Method 300 begins with step 302 wherein the ECM 50 determines which
 5 one or more jacks 42-48 are requested or anticipated as being actuated or moved and, for each of
   the one or more jacks 42-48 that are requested or anticipated to be actuated or moved, the ECM
   50 determines a direction in which the jack will move. For each of the one or more jacks 42-48
   that are requested or anticipated to be actuated or moved, a present or anticipated speed, a
   present or anticipated acceleration, a present or anticipated jacking height or extension length,
10 and/or various other parameters may be determined through receiving control signals from
   another electronic control module, obtaining control signals as part of an application stored in
   memory 54 of ECM 50, and/or obtained from sensors 72-78 included in jacks 42-48. At least
   once the requested jacks and their directions are determined or obtained, the method 300 can
   proceed to step 304.
15                        In step 304, it is determined whether a max twist threshold Emx is
   exceeded. This step may include gathering sensor readings from a first tilt sensor 32 and a
   second tilt sensor 34 so as to measure a first angle 01 and a second angle  02, calculating a twist
   angle OA, and then comparing the twist angle to a max twist threshold 0mx. The twist angle OA
   may be calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the first angle 01 and the
20 second angle 02 such that A 0i - 02|. The max twist value 0x
                                  =                                    may be recalled from memory
   54 of the ECM 50, or may otherwise be received or obtained at the ECM 50. In one
   embodiment, the first angle 01 and the second angle    02 may be measured upon the method 300
   reaching step 304. In other embodiments, a last measured value for both the first angle 01 and
   the second angle   02  may be obtained from, for example, memory 54 of the ECM 50. The
25 receiving of sensor values from tilt sensors 32 and 34, the recall of last measured sensor values
   from memory 54, and/or the various calculations and logic included in this step may be carried
   out by processor 52 of the ECM 50. When OA > Omx, then the method 300 proceeds to step 306;
   otherwise, the method 300 proceeds to step 356.

   P-5233.3022.004/LCI/IDS
                                                   - 15
                           In step 306, it is determined whether the request is to extend the requested
   jack(s) or retract the requested jack(s). This determination may be made by using the processor
   52 of the ECM 50 to inspect the obtained information from step 302 as to the direction in which
   each of the requested    jacks are moving. In some embodiments, it may be determined whether
 5 the jacks are presently extended or retracting and, in other embodiments, it may be determined
   whether the request received (step 302) is to extend or retract the requested    jack(s). In the case
   that the one or more requested jacks are extending or requested to be extended, the method 300
   proceeds to step 308; otherwise, the method 300 proceeds to step 314.
                           In step 308, it is determined whether the first angle 01 that is measured by
10 the first tilt sensor 32 is larger than the second angle     02  that is measured by the second tilt
   sensor 34. As mentioned above, the first sensor 32 may be positioned between the rear jacks
   (rear-left jack 42 and rear-right jack 44) and, thus, the first angle 01 may represent   an angle that
   the rear portion of the platform forms relative to a gravity level plane. And, the second sensor 34
   may be positioned between the front jacks (front-left jack 46 and front-right jack 48) and, thus,
15 the second angle    02 may represent an angle that the front portion of the platform forms with a
   gravity level plane. The comparison of the first and second angles may be carried out by
   processor 52, which may receive the sensor signals representing the first angle 01 from the first
   sensor 32 and the second angle     02  from the second sensor 34 directly, or which may recall tilt
   sensor angle values from memory 54. In the latter case, the tilt sensor angle values that are
20 recalled from memory may be the last measured tilt sensor angle values or may be an average
   tilt sensor angle value that is calculated based on a plurality of previously and/or recently
   obtained tilt sensor angle values from sensors 32 and 34. When it is determined that the first
   angle 01 from the first sensor 32 is greater than the second angle     02 from the second sensor 34,
   then the method 300 continues to step 310; otherwise, the method 300 continues to step 312.
25                          In step 310, once it has been determined that the maximum twist
   threshold has been reached (step 304), that the requested jacks are to be extended (or are
   presently extending) (step 306), and that the rear portion of the platform 10 is inclined at a larger
   angle than the front portion of the platform 10 (step 308), then the right-rear jack 44 and/or the

   P-5233.3022.004/LCI/IDS
                                                     - 16
   left-front jack 46 are stopped and/or slowed. In Figure 1, the first angle 01 is smaller than the
   second angle     02  and, thus, in this scenario, the method would have proceeded to step 312,
   which is explained below. However, when the first angle        01 is larger than the second angle  02,
   then the right-rear jack 44 and/or the left-front jack 46 would be stopped and/or slowed as to not
 5 increase the twist of the platform 10. The method 300 continues to step 356.
                             In step 312, once it has been determined that the maximum twist
   threshold has been reached (step 304), that the requested jacks are to be extended (or are
   presently extending) (step 306), and that the first angle O1 is smaller than (or equal to) the
   second angle    02  (e.g., the rear portion of the platform 10 is inclined at a larger angle than the
10 front portion of the platform 10) (step 308), then the left-rear jack 42 and/or the right-front jack
   48 are stopped and/or slowed. For example, as shown in Figure 1, if the right-front jack 48 were
   to be extended more, this would cause the difference between the first angle        01 and the second
   angle  02  to increase along with the amount of twist of platform 10. Thus, if there is a request to
   extend right-front jack 48, then, upon reaching step 310, the right front jack would be stopped
15 and/or slowed. The method 300 continues to step 356.
                             In step 314, after it has been determined that the requested jack(s) are
   going to retract (or are presently retracting), it is determined whether a pair of jacks (as opposed
   to a single jack) has been requested to retract. In one embodiment, processing device 52 may
   determine which pair of jacks have been requested to be retracted and, based thereon, may
20 determine whether the requested jacks constitute a pair, such as the rear jack pair (jacks 42 and
   44), the front jack pair (jacks 46 and 48), the left jack pair (jacks 42 and 46), or the right jack
   pair (jacks 44 and 48). If a single jack has been requested to be retracted, then the method 300
   continues to step 316; otherwise, the method 300 continues to step 322.
                             In step 316, it is determined whether the first angle 01 that is measured by
25 the first tilt sensor 32 is larger than the second angle     02  that is measured by the second tilt
   sensor 34. This step is analogous to step 308, except that the outcome of this determination will
   result in different actions since, upon reaching step 316, the requested jack is to be retracted

   P-5233.3022.004/LCI/IDS
                                                     - 17
   instead of extended, as is the case in step 308. For example, when it is determined that the first
   angle 01 is larger than the second angle           02, then the method 300 continues to step 318;
   otherwise, the method 300 continues to step 320.
                             In step 318, once it has been determined that the maximum twist
 5 threshold has been reached (step 304), that a single requested jack is to be retracted (step 306
   and 314), and that the first angle 01 is larger than the second angle     02  (e.g., the rear portion of
   the platform 10 is inclined at a larger angle than the front portion of the platform 10) (step 316),
   then the left-rear jack 42 and/or the right-front jack 48 are stopped and/or slowed. This step is
   similar in nature to step 312 discussed above and, thus, can be carried out in a like manner. The
10 method 300 continues to step 356.
                             In step 320, once it has been determined that the maximum twist
   threshold has been reached (step 304), that a single requested jack is to be retracted (step 306
   and 314), and that the first angle 01 is less than (or equal to) the second angle     02  (e.g., the front
   portion of the platform 10 is inclined at a larger angle than the rear portion of the platform 10)
15 (step 316), then the right-rear jack 44 and/or the left-front jack 46 are stopped and/or slowed.
   For example, as shown in Figure 1, if the left-front jack 46 were to be retracted more as
   requested, this would cause the difference between the first angle 01 and the second angle          02  to
   increase along with the amount of twist of platform 10. Thus, if there is a request to extend left
   front jack 46, then, upon reaching step 320, the left-front jack 46 would be stopped and/or
20 slowed. However, if the right-front jack 48 were to be retracted more, this requested action
   would not be inhibited or prevented since the retraction of the fight-front jack 48 would
   decrease the platform twist of platform 10. The method 300 continues to step 356.
                             In step 322, after it has been determined that there is a request to retract a
   pair of j acks, then it is determined whether both of the jacks of the other jack pair are in contact
25 with the ground. For example, if the rear jack pair is requested to be moved, then it may be
   determined whether the jacks 46 and 48 of the front jack pair are in contact with surface 2. If
   both jacks are off the surface 2 (i.e., not in contact with the surface 2), then the method can

   P-5233.3022.004/LCI/IDS
                                                   -  18
   proceed to step 316, which will result in stopping or slowing one of the jack pairs that are
   requested to be moved, while allowing the other jack of the requested jack pair to retract in the
   requested manner as to mitigate and/or reduce the twist of platform 10. Although method 300
   does not distinguish between requesting a single jack to be extended and requesting a jack pair
 5 to be extended, those skilled in the art will appreciate that other embodiments of the method
   exist, such as a method similar to method 300, but that includes steps analogous to steps 314 to
   354 that are modified to address situations in which the jacks are extended such that platform
   twist is mitigated. If one or both of the jacks of the other jack pair are in contact with the
   ground, the method 300 continues to step 324; otherwise, the method 300 continues to step 316.
10                         In step 324, it is determined whether the rear jack pair (jacks 42 and 44)
   has been requested to be retracted. This step may be carried out by processing device 52 of
   ECM 50, which may determine which jacks are to be requested through evaluating user input
   that may be received according to any one or more embodiments discussed above with respect
   to step 302. In another embodiment, the requested jack information may be saved in memory 54
15 and, upon step 324 being reached, the requested jack information may be recalled and evaluated
   by processing device 52 of ECM 50. When it is determined that the rear jack pair has been
   requested to be retracted, the method 300 continues to step 326; otherwise, the method 300
   continues to step 340.
                           In step 326, it is determined whether the first angle 01 that is measured by
20 the first tilt sensor 32 is larger than the second angle 02 that is measured by the second tilt
   sensor 34. This step is analogous to step 308 and 316, except that the outcome of this
   determination will result in different actions as to mitigate or prevent further twist of the
   platform 10 according to the particular situation, which those skilled in the art will appreciate is
   different for steps 308, 316, and 326. When it is determined that the first angle 01 is larger than
25 the second angle    02,  then the method 300 continues to step 328; otherwise, the method 300
   continues to step 334.

                           In step 328, it is determined whether the right-front jack 48 is on the
   ground. This can be determined through using various sensors, such as sensor 78 of jack 48, or
   may be determined by feedback information provided to ECM 50 that indicates the jack 48 can
   no longer extend. When it is determined that the right-front jack 48 is on the surface 2, the
 5 method 300 proceeds to step 330; otherwise, the method 300 proceeds to step 332.
                           In step 330, the right-front jack 48 is retracted. This may include
   generating a jack retraction signal using processing device 52 of ECM 50 and, subsequently,
   sending the jack retraction signal to the right-front jack 48. If there had been a request to extend
   the right-front jack 48, then this request can be disregarded. The method 300 continues to step
10 356.
                           In step 332, the left-front jack 46 is extended. This may include
   generating a jack extension signal using processing device 52 of ECM 50 and, subsequently,
   sending the jack extension signal to left-front jack 46. This step may include ignoring the
   request to retract the rear jack pair, and may also or alternatively include extending the left-front
15 jack 46 while the rearjack pair is retracted. The method 300 continues to step 356.
                           In step 334, it is determined whether the left-front jack 46 is on the
   ground. This can be determined through using various sensors, such as sensor 76 of jack 46, or
   may be determined by feedback information provided to ECM 50 that indicates the jack 46 can
   no longer extend. When it is determined that the left-front jack 46 is on the surface 2, the
20 method 300 proceeds to step 336; otherwise, the method 300 proceeds to step 338.
                           In step 336, the left-front jack 46 is retracted. This may include generating
   a jack retraction signal using processing device 52 of ECM 50 and, subsequently, sending the
   jack retraction signal to the left-front jack 46. If there had been a request to extend the left-front
   jack 46, then this request can be disregarded. The method 300 continues to step 356.
25                         In step 338, the right-front jack 48 is extended. This may include
   generating a jack extension signal using processing device 52 of ECM 50 and, subsequently,

   P-5233.3022.004/LCI/IDS
                                                  - 20
   sending the jack extension signal to right-front jack 48. Additionally, this step may include
   ignoring the request to retract the rear jack pair, and may also or alternatively include extending
   the right-front jack 48 while the rear jack pair is retracted. The method 300 continues to step
   356.
 5                        In step 340, it is determined whether the front jack pair (jacks 46 and 48)
   has been requested to be retracted. This step may be carried out by the processing device 52 of
   the ECM 50, which may determine which jacks are to be requested through evaluating user
   input that can be received according to any one or more embodiments discussed above with
   respect to step 302. The requested jack information may be saved in memory 54 and, upon step
10 332 being reached, the requested jack information may be recalled and evaluated by processing
   device 52 of ECM 50. When it is determined that the rear jack pair has been requested to be
   retracted, the method 300 continues to step 342. Otherwise, the method 300 continues to step
   302 where the requested jacks and requested directions may be obtained. For example, in one
   scenario, the platform mitigation apparatus 1 that is discussed in conjunction with method 300
15 may only permit the front jack pair or the rear jack pair to be operated and may not permit other
   jack pairs to be operated simultaneously. Thus, if it is determined that a jack pair is requested to
   be retracted (step 314), that the rear jack pair and the front jack pair are not the requested pair to
   be retracted (steps 324 and 340), then there may be an error in the determination of which jacks
   have been requested to be moved. Thus, the method 300 may proceed back to step 302 and,
20 additionally, may notify the user using a human-machine interface that the requested jack
   actions are invalid.
                          In step 342, it is determined whether the first angle 01 that is measured by
   the first tilt sensor 32 is larger than the second angle    02   that is measured by the second tilt
   sensor 34. This step is analogous to steps 308, 316, and 326, with the exception that the
25 outcome of this determination will result in different actions as to mitigate or prevent further
   twist of the platform 10 according to the particular situation, which those skilled in the art will
   appreciate is different for steps 308, 316, 326, and 342. When it is determined that the first

   P-5233.3022.004/LCI/IDS
                                                  - 21
   angle 01 is larger than the second angle 02, then the method 300 continues to step 344;
   otherwise, the method 300 continues to step 350.
                          In step 342, it is determined whether the right-rear jack 44 is on the
   ground. This can be determined through using various sensors, such as sensor 74 of jack 44, or
 5 may be determined by feedback information provided to ECM 50 that indicates the jack 44 can
   no longer extend. When it is determined that the right-rear jack 44 is on the surface 2, the
   method 300 proceeds to step 346; otherwise, the method 300 proceeds to step 348.
                          In step 346, the right-rear jack 44 is retracted. This may include
   generating a jack retraction signal using processing device 52 of ECM 50 and, subsequently,
10 sending the jack retraction signal to the right-rear jack 44. If there had been a request to extend
   the right-rear jack 44, then this request can be disregarded. The method 300 continues to step
   356.
                          In step 348, the left-rear jack 42 is extended. This may include generating
   a jack extension signal using the processing device 52 of the ECM 50 and, subsequently,
15 sending the jack extension signal to the left-rear jack 42. Additionally, at least in some
   embodiments, this step may include ignoring the request to retract the front jack pair; in other
   embodiments, the left-rear jack 42 may be extended while the front jack pair is retracted. The
   method 300 continues to step 356.
                          In step 350, it is determined whether the left-rear jack 42 is on the ground.
20 This can be determined through using various sensors, such as sensor 72 of jack 42, or may be
   determined by feedback information provided to ECM 50 that indicates the jack 42 can no
   longer extend. When it is determined that the left-rear jack 42 is on the surface 2, the method
   300 proceeds to step 352; otherwise, the method 300 proceeds to step 354.
                          In step 352, the left-rear jack 42 is retracted. This may include generating
25 a jack retraction signal using processing device 52 of ECM 50 and, subsequently, sending the

   P-5233.3022.004/LCI/IDS
                                                  - 22
   jack retraction signal to the left-rear jack 42. If there had been a request to extend the left-rear
   jack 42, then this request can be disregarded. The method 300 continues to step 356.
                          In step 354, the right-rear jack 44 is extended. This may include
   generating a jack extension signal using processing the device 52 of the ECM 50 and,
 5 subsequently, sending the jack extension signal to the right-rear jack 44. Additionally, at least in
   some embodiments, this step may include ignoring the request to retract the front jack pair; in
   other embodiments, the right-rear jack 44 may be extended while the front jack pair is retracted.
   The method 300 continues to step 356.
                          In step 356, the jack(s) are operated according to the requested operation
10 (step 302) and according to the determined mitigation and/or preventative action (steps 310,
   312, 318, 320, 330, 332, 336, 338, 346, 348, 352, and 354). For example, if the platform 10
   were in the twisted state (i.e., experiencing a platform twist condition) as shown in Figure 1 and
   there was a request to extend right-front jack 48, then the method would reach step 312, where it
   is determined to stop and/or slow the extension of right-front jack 48 such that the platform is
15 not twisted further. At least in some embodiments, where the platform twist condition is met
   and only one jack is requested to be operated, when the requested operation of the jack worsens
   the platform twist condition, then the requested operation will be prevented. In situations where
   a pair of jacks are requested to be operated, a single jack of the jack pair may be slowed such
   that the other jack can catch up thereby reducing the degree of the platform twist condition.
20 Examples are provided below that illustrate these points. After step 356 is carried out, the
   method 300 proceeds back to step 302, where the method 300 may be repeated again.
                          Thus, as discussed above, the platform twist mitigation apparatus 1 and
   method may be used to reduce platform twist of platform 10. For example, with reference to
   Figure 1, if the user request that left-rear jack 42 be extended such that the left-rear corner of
25 platform 10 is raised, then the twist of platform 10 would be worsened. Using method 300, it
   can be determined that the left-rear jack 42 has been requested to be extended (steps 302, 306),
   that the max twist threshold O.      has been exceeded (0., < OA) (step 304), and that the first

   P-5233.3022.004/LCI/IDS
                                                  - 23
   angle 01 is smaller than (or equal to) the second angle    02 (step 308). Therefore, the left-rearjack
   42 can be stopped so as to not worsen the twist of platform 10.
                           In another example, a user may request to extend the front jack pair. For
   illustrative purposes, it may be assumed that the platform 10 is in the twisted condition as
 5 shown in Figure 1. Thus, the method 300 may be used to determine that the front jack pair has
   been requested to be extended (steps 302, 306), that the max twist threshold 0x              has been
   exceeded (Omx < OA) (step 304), and that the first angle G1 is smaller than (or equal to) the
   second angle    02 (step 308). Therefore, the right-front jack 42 can be stopped and/or slowed
   while still allowing the left-front jack 46 to extend so as to reduce the twist of platform 10.
10                         In another embodiment, platform 10 may initially be in a leveled
   condition, such as that which is shown in Figure 2. A user may request to move ajack pair, such
   as the right jack pair which includes right-rear jack 44 and fight-front jack 48. Although the
   right-rear jack 44 and the fight-front jack 48 may be requested to be moved in a like manner,
   due to an uneven distribution of load (or weight) on platform 10, one or more of the jacks may
15 move faster or slower than the other. Thus, assuming a scenario where the right-front jack 48
   extends faster than the right-rear jack 44, when the max twist threshold Omx has been exceeded
   (0x     < OA) (step 304) due to the fact that the right-front jack 48 extended faster than the right
   rear jack 44, the method 300 may proceed to step 312, which would cause the right-front jack
   48 to stop while allowing the right-rear jack 44 to continue extending so that the right-rear jack
20 44 and the right-front jack 48 to be extended the same or similar amount. In other embodiments,
   the method 300 may cause the right-front jack 48 to slow down while allowing right-rear jack
   44 to continue at the same initial speed so as to allow the right-rear jack 44 and the right-front
   jack 48 to be extended the same or similar amount.
                           Additionally, the method 300 may be modified so that, when a platform
25 twist condition is detected, the ECM 50 generates one or more extension and/or retraction
   signals that can be sent to one or more jacks 42-48 so as to actively augment the operation of the

    P-5233.3022.004/LCI/IDS
                                                  - 24
    jacks. Additionally, or alternatively, one or more of the jacks 42-48 can have its speed increased
    so that the platform twist can be mitigated.
                           Moreover, the method 300 may continuously be carried out such that the
    platform twist mitigation apparatus may continuously respond to changing platform attitude by,
  5 for example, determining whether the max twist threshold is exceeded. Various other scenarios
    and/or embodiments will be appreciated by those skilled in the art in light of the method 300
    discussed above and the other operating principles of the platform twist mitigation apparatus 1
    discussed herein.
