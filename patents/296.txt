                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001a]      The present invention relates to materials and methods for conjugating a water
soluble polymer to a protein.
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[00021       The preparation of conjugates by forming a covalent linkage between the water
soluble polymer and the therapeutic protein can be carried out by a variety of chemical
methods. PEGylation of polypeptide drugs protects them in circulation and improves their
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles (Harris and Chess, Nat Rev Drug Discov.
2003;2:214-21). The PEGylation process attaches repeating units of ethylene glycol
(polyethylene glycol (PEG)) to a polypeptide drug. PEG molecules have a large hydrodynamic
 volume (5 - 10 times the size of globular proteins), are highly water soluble and hydrated, non
toxic, non-immunogenic and rapidly cleared from the body. PEGylation of molecules can lead
 to increased resistance of drugs to enzymatic degradation, increased half-life in vivo, reduced
 dosing frequency, decreased immunogenicity, increased physical and thermal stability,
 increased solubility, increased liquid stability, and reduced aggregation. The first PEGylated
 drugs were approved by the FDA in the early 1990s. Since then, the FDA has approved several
 PEGylated drugs for oral, injectable, and topical administration.
 [00031       Polysialic acid (PSA), also referred to as colominic acid (CA), is a naturally
 occurring polysaccharide. It is a homopolymer of N-acetylneuraminic acid with a(2-+8)
 ketosidic linkage and contains vicinal diol groups at its non-reducing end. It is negatively
 charged and a natural constituent of the human body. It can easily be produced from bacteria in
 large quantities and with pre-determined physical characteristics (US Patent No. 5,846,951).
 Because the bacterially-produced PSA is chemically and immunologically identical to PSA
 produced in the human body, bacterial PSA is non-immunogenic, even when coupled to

proteins. Unlike some polymers, PSA acid is biodegradable. Covalent coupling of colominic
acid to catalase and asparaginase has been shown to increase enzyme stability in the presence of
proteolytic enzymes or blood plasma. Comparative studies ,n vivo with polysialylated and
unmodified asparaginase revealed that polysialylation increased the half-life of the enzyme
(Fernandes and Gregoriadis, Int J Pharm. 2001;217:215-24).
                              [TEXT CONTINUES ON PAGE 2]

[0004]      Coupling of PEG-derivatives to peptides or proteins is reviewed by Roberts et al.
(Adv Drug Deliv Rev 2002;54:459-76). One approach for coupling water soluble polymers
to therapeutic proteins is the conjugation of the polymers via the carbohydrate moieties of the
protein. Vicinal hydroxyl (OH) groups of carbohydrates in proteins can be easily oxidized
with sodium periodate (NaIO4) to form active aldehyde groups (Rothfus et Smith, J Biol
Chem 1963; 238:1402-10; van Lenten et Ashwell, J Biol Chem 1971;246:1889-94).
Subsequently the polymer can be coupled to the aldehyde groups of the carbohydrate by use
of reagents containing, for example, an active hydrazide group (Wilchek M and Bayer EA,
Methods Enzymol 1987;138:429-42). A more recent technology is the use of reagents
containing aminooxy groups which react with aldehydes to form oxime linkages (WO
96/40662, W02008/025856).
[0005]      Additional examples describing conjugation of a water soluble polymer to a
therapeutic protein are described in WO 06/071801 which teaches the oxidation of
carbohydrate moieties in Von Willebrand factor and subsequent coupling to PEG using
hydrazide chemistry; US Publication No. 2009/0076237 which teaches the oxidation of
rFVIII and subsequent coupling to PEG and other water soluble polymers (e.g. PSA, HES,
dextran) using hydrazide chemistry; WO 2008/025856 which teaches oxidation of different
coagulation factors, e.g. rFIX, FVIII and FVIla and subsequent coupling to e.g., PEG, using
aminooxy chemistry by forming an oxime linkage; and US Patent No. 5,621,039 which
teaches the oxidation of FIX and subsequent coupling to PEG using hydrazide chemistry.
[0006]      Recently, an improved method was described comprising mild periodate oxidation
of sialic acids to generate aldehydes followed by reaction with an aminooxy group containing
reagent in the presence of catalytic amounts of aniline (Dirksen A., and Dawson PE,
Bioconjugate Chem. 2008;19,2543-8; and Zeng Y et al., Nature Methods 2009;6:207-9). The
aniline catalysis dramatically accelerates the oxime ligation, allowing the use of very low
concentrations of the reagent. The use of nucelophilic catalysts are also described in Dirksen,
A., et al., J Am Chem Soc., 128:15602-3 (2006); Dirksen, A., et al., Angew chem. Int Ed.,
45:7581-4 (2006); Kohler, J.J., ChemBioChem., 10:2147-50 (2009); Giuseppone, N., et al., J
Am Chem Soc., 127:5528-39 (2005); and Thygesen, M.B., et al., J Org Chem., 75:1752-5
(2010).
[0007]      Although aniline catalysis can accelerate the oxime ligation allowing short reaction
times and the use of low concentrations of the aminooxy reagent, aniline has toxic properties
that must be considered when, for example, the conjugated therapeutic protein to form the
                                               -2-

basis of a pharmaceutical. For example, aniline has been shown to induce
methemoglobinemia (Harrison, J.H, and Jollow, D.J., Molecular Pharmacology, 32(3) 423
431, 1987). Long-term dietary treatment of rats has been shown to induce tumors in the
spleen (Goodman, DG., et al., J Nati Cancer Inst., 73(1):265-73, 1984). In vitro studies have
also shown that aniline has the potential to induce chromosome mutations and has the
potentially genotoxic activity (Bombhard E.M. et Herbold B, Critical Reviews in Toxicology
35,783-835, 2005).
[0008]     Considering the potentially dangerous properties of aniline and notwithstanding the
methods available of conjugating water soluble polymers to therapeutic proteins, there
remains a need to develop materials and methods for conjugating water soluble polymers to
proteins that improves the protein's pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic properties
while minimizing the costs associated with the various reagents and minimizing the health
risks to the patient recipient.

                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0057]     The pharmacological and immunological properties of therapeutic proteins can be
improved by chemical modification and conjugation with polymeric compounds such as
polyethylene glycol (PEG), branched PEG, polysialic acid (PSA), hydroxyalkyl starch
(HAS), hydroxylethyl starch (HES), carbohydrate, polysaccharides, pullulan, chitosan,
hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, starch, dextran, carboxymethyl
dextran, polyalkylene oxide (PAO), polyalkylene glycol (PAG), polypropylene glycol (PPG),
polyoxazoline, polyacryloylmorpholine, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polycarboxylate,
polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyphosphazene, polyoxazoline, polyethylene-co-maleic acid
anhydride, polystyrene-co-maleic acid anhydride, poly(I -hydroxymethylethvlene
hydroxymethylformal) (PHF), 2-methacryloyloxy-2' -ethyltrimethylammoniumphosphate
(MPC). The properties of the resulting conjugates generally strongly depend on the structure
and the size of the polymer. Thus, polymers with a defined and narrow size distribution are
usually preferred in the art. Synthetic polymers like PEG can be manufactured easily with a
narrow size distribution, while PSA can be purified in such a manner that results in a final
PSA preparation with a narrow size distribution. In addition PEGylation reagents with
defined polymer chains and narrow size distribution are on the market and commercially
available for a reasonable price.
 [0058]    The addition of a soluble polymer, such as through polysialylation, is one approach
 to improve the properties of therapeutic proteins such as the blood coagulation protein FIX,
 as well as other coagulation proteins (e.g., VWF, FVIIa (see, e.g., US 2008/0221032A1,
 incorporated herein by reference) and FVIII).

[0062]     The therapeutic proteins provided herein should not be considered to be exclusive.
Rather, as is apparent from the disclosure provided herein, the methods of the invention are
applicable to any protein wherein attachment of a water soluble polymer is desired according
to the invention. For example, therapeutic proteins are described in US 2007/0026485,
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Blood coagulation proteins
[0063]     In one aspect, the starting material of the present invention is a blood coagulation
protein, which can be derived from human plasma, or produced by recombinant engineering
techniques, as described in patents US Patent No. 4,757,006; US Patent No. 5,733,873; US
Patent No. 5,198,349; US Patent No. 5,250,421; US Patent No. 5,919,766; and EP 306 968.
[0064]     Therapeutic polypeptides such as blood coagulation proteins including Factor IX
(FIX), Factor VIII (FVIII), Factor VIIa (FVIIa), Von Willebrand Factor (VWF), Factor FV
(FV), Factor X (FX), Factor XI (FXI), Factor XII (FXII), thrombin (FII), protein C, protein S,
tPA, PAI-I, tissue factor (TF) and ADAMTS 13 protease are rapidly degraded by proteolytic
enzymes and neutralized by antibodies. This reduces their half-life and circulation time,
thereby limiting their therapeutic effectiveness. Relatively high doses and frequent
administration are necessary to reach and sustain the desired therapeutic or prophylactic
effect of these coagulation proteins. As a consequence, adequate dose regulation is difficult
to obtain and the need of frequent intravenous administrations imposes restrictions on the
patient's way of living.
[0065]     As described herein, blood coagulation proteins including, but not limited to, Factor
IX (FIX), Factor VIII (FVIII), Factor VIIa (FVIIa), Von Willebrand Factor (VWF), Factor
FV (FV), Factor X (FX), Factor XI, Factor XII (FXII), thrombin (FII), protein C, protein S,
tPA, PAI-I, tissue factor (TF) and ADAMTS 13 protease are contemplated by the invention.
As used herein, the term "blood coagulation protein" refers to any Factor IX (FIX), Factor
VIII (FVIII), Factor VIIa (FVIIa), Von Willebrand Factor (VWF), Factor FV (FV), Factor X
(FX), Factor XII (FXII), thrombin (FII), protein C, protein S, tPA, PAI-1, tissue factor (TF)
and ADAMTS 13 protease which exhibits biological activity that is associated with that
particular native blood coagulation protein.

[0066]      The blood coagulation cascade is divided into three distinct segments: the intrinsic,
extrinsic, and common pathways (Schenone et al., Curr Opin Hematol. 2004; 11:272-7). The
cascade involves a series of serine protease enzymes (zymogens) and protein cofactors. When
required, an inactive zymogen precursor is converted into the active form, which
consequently converts the next enzyme in the cascade.
[0067]      The intrinsic pathway requires the clotting factors VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII.
Initiation of the intrinsic pathway occurs when prekallikrein, high-molecular-weight
kininogen, factor XI (FXI) and factor XII (FXII) are exposed to a negatively charged surface.
Also required are calcium ions and phospholipids secreted from platelets.
[0068]      The extrinsic pathway is initiated when the vascular lumen of blood vessels is
damaged. The membrane glycoprotein tissue factor is exposed and then binds to circulating
factor VII (FVII) and to small preexisting amounts of its activated form FVIIa. This binding
facilitates full conversion of FVII to FVIIa and subsequently, in the presence of calcium and
phospholipids, the conversion of factor IX (FIX) to factor IXa (FIXa) and factor X (FX) to
factor Xa (FXa). The association of FVIIa with tissue factor enhances the proteolytic activity
by bringing the binding sites of FVII for the substrate (FIX and FX) into closer proximity and
by inducing a conformational change, which enhances the enzymatic activity of FVIIa.
[0069]      The activation of FX is the common point of the two pathways. Along with
phospholipid and calcium, factors Va (FVa) and Xa convert prothrombin to thrombin
(prothrombinase complex), which then cleaves fibrinogen to form fibrin monomers. The
monomers polymerize to form fibrin strands. Factor XIIIa (FXIIIa) covalently bonds these
strands to one another to form a rigid mesh.
[0070]      Conversion of FVII to FVIIa is also catalyzed by a number of proteases, including
thrombin, FIXa, FXa, factor XIa (FXIa), and factor XIIa (FXIIa). For inhibition of the early
phase of the cascade, tissue factor pathway inhibitor targets FVIIa/tissue factor/FXa product
complex.
Factor VIIa
[0071]      FVII (also known as stable factor or proconvertin) is a vitamin K-dependent serine
protease glycoprotein with a pivotal role in hemostasis and coagulation (Eigenbrot, Curr
Protein Pept Sci. 2002;3:287-99).
                                               - 46 -

[0072]     FVII is synthesized in the liver and secreted as a single-chain glycoprotein of 48
kD. FVII shares with all vitamin K-dependent serine protease glycoproteins a similar protein
domain structure consisting of an amino-terminal gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain
with 9-12 residues responsible for the interaction of the protein with lipid membranes, a
carboxy-terminal serine protease domain (catalytic domain), and two epidermal growth
factor-like domains containing a calcium ion binding site that mediates interaction with
tissue factor. Gamma-glutamyl carboxylase catalyzes carboxylation of Gla residues in the
amino-terminal portion of the molecule. The carboxylase is dependent on a reduced form of
vitamin K for its action, which is oxidized to the epoxide form. Vitamin K epoxide reductase
is required to convert the epoxide form of vitamin K back to the reduced form.
[0073]     The major proportion of FVII circulates in plasma in zymogen form, and activation
of this form results in cleavage of the peptide bond between arginine 152 and isoleucine 153.
The resulting activated FVJIa consists of a NH2-derived light chain (20 kD) and a COOH
terminal-derived heavy chain (30 kD) linked via a single disulfide bond (Cys 135 to Cys
262). The light chain contains the membrane-binding Gla domain, while the heavy chain
contains the catalytic domain.
[0074]     The plasma concentration of FVII determined by genetic and environmental factors
is about 0.5 mg/mL (Pinotti et al., Blood. 2000;95:3423-8). Different FVII genotypes can
result in several-fold differences in mean FVII levels. Plasma FVII levels are elevated during
pregnancy in healthy females and also increase with age and are higher in females and in
persons with hypertriglyceridemia. FVII has the shortest half-life of all procoagulant factors
(3-6 h). The mean plasma concentration of FVJIa is 3.6 ng/mL in healthy individuals and the
circulating half-life of FVIla is relatively long (2.5 h) compared with other coagulation
factors.
[0075]     Hereditary FVII deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder with a
prevalence estimated to be 1 case per 500,000 persons in the general population (Acharya et
al., J Thromb Haemost. 2004;2248-56). Acquired FVII deficiency from inhibitors is also
very rare. Cases have also been reported with the deficiency occurring in association with
drugs such as cephalosporins, penicillins, and oral anticoagulants. Furthermore, acquired
FVII deficiency has been reported to occur spontaneously or with other conditions, such as
myeloma, sepsis, aplastic anemia, with interleukin-2 and antithymocyte globulin therapy.

PNAS 1986; 83: 2412-6), and P08709 for the polypeptide sequence (references incorporated
herein in their entireties). A variety of polymorphisms of FVII have been described, for
example see Sabater-Lleal et al. (Hum Genet. 2006; 118:741-51) (reference incorporated
herein in its entirety).
Factor IX
[0077]     FIX is a vitamin K-dependent plasma protein that participates in the intrinsic
pathway of blood coagulation by converting FX to its active form in the presence of calcium
ions, phospholipids and FVIIIa. The predominant catalytic capability of FIX is as a seine
protease with specificity for a particular arginine-isoleucine bond within FX. Activation of
FIX occurs by FXIa which causes excision of the activation peptide from FIX to produce an
activated FIX molecule comprising two chains held by one or more disulphide bonds.
Defects in FIX are the cause of recessive X-linked hemophilia B.
[0078]     Hemophilia A and B are inherited diseases characterized by deficiencies in FVIII
and FIX polypeptides, respectively. The underlying cause of the deficiencies is frequently
the result of mutations in FVIII and FIX genes, both of which are located on the X
chromosome. Traditional therapy for hemophilias often involves intravenous administration
of pooled plasma or semi-purified coagulation proteins from normal individuals. These
preparations can be contaminated by pathogenic agents or viruses, such as infectious prions,
HIV, parvovirus, hepatitis A, and hepatitis C. Hence, there is an urgent need for therapeutic
agents that do not require the use of human serum.
[0079]     The level of the decrease in FIX activity is directly proportional to the severity of
hemophilia B. The current treatment of hemophilia B consists of the replacement of the
missing protein by plasma-derived or recombinant FIX (so-called FIX substitution or
replacement treatment or therapy).
[0080]     Polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences of FIX can be found for example in the
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Accession No. P00740, US Pat. No. 6,531,298 and in Figure 1 (SEQ
ID NO: 1).

Factor VIII
[0081]     Coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) circulates in plasma at a very low concentration and
is bound non-covalently to Von Willebrand factor (VWF). During hemostasis, FVIII is
separated from VWF and acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX (FIXa)-mediated FX
activation by enhancing the rate of activation in the presence of calcium and phospholipids or
cellular membranes.
[0082]     FVIII is synthesized as a single-chain precursor of approximately 270-330 kD with
the domain structure A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. When purified from plasma (e.g., "plasma
derived" or "plasmatic"), FVIII is composed of a heavy chain (Al-A2-B) and a light chain
(A3-C1-C2). The molecular mass of the light chain is 80 kD whereas, due to proteolysis
within the B domain, the heavy chain is in the range of 90-220 kD.
[0083]     FVIII is also synthesized as a recombinant protein for therapeutic use in bleeding
disorders. Various in vitro assays have been devised to determine the potential efficacy of
recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) as a therapeutic medicine. These assays mimic the in vivo
effects of endogenous FVIII. In vitro thrombin treatment of FVIII results in a rapid increase
and subsequent decrease in its procoagulant activity, as measured by in vitro assays. This
activation and inactivation coincides with specific limited proteolysis both in the heavy and
the light chains, which alter the availability of different binding epitopes in FVIII, e.g.
allowing FVIII to dissociate from VWF and bind to a phospholipid surface or altering the
binding ability to certain monoclonal antibodies.
[0084]     The lack or dysfunction of FVIII is associated with the most frequent bleeding
disorder, hemophilia A. The treatment of choice for the management of hemophilia A is
replacement therapy with plasma derived or rFVIII concentrates. Patients with severe
hemophilia A with FVIII levels below 1 %, are generally on prophylactic therapy with the
aim of keeping FVIII above 1% between doses. Taking into account the average half-lives of
the various FVIII products in the circulation, this result can usually be achieved by giving
FVIII two to three times a week.

Von Willebrand Factor
[0086]      Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a glycoprotein circulating in plasma as a series of
multimers ranging in size from about 500 to 20,000 kD. Multimeric forms of VWF are
composed of 250 kD polypeptide subunits linked together by disulfide bonds. VWF mediates
initial platelet adhesion to the sub-endothelium of the damaged vessel wall. Only the larger
multimers exhibit hemostatic activity. It is assumed that endothelial cells secrete large
polymeric forms of VWF and those forms of VWF which have a low molecular weight (low
molecular weight VWF) arise from proteolytic cleavage. The multimers having large
molecular masses are stored in the Weibel-Pallade bodies of endothelial cells and liberated
upon stimulation.
[0087]      VWF is synthesized by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes as prepro-VWF that
consists to a large extent of repeated domains. Upon cleavage of the signal peptide, pro
VWF dimerizes through disulfide linkages at its C-terminal region. The dimers serve as
protomers for multimerization, which is governed by disulfide linkages between the free end
termini. The assembly to multimers is followed by the proteolytic removal of the propeptide
sequence (Leyte et al., Biochem. J. 274 (1991), 257-261).
[0088]      The primary translation product predicted from the cloned cDNA of VWF is a
2813-residue precursor polypeptide (prepro-VWF). The prepro-VWF consists of a 22 amino
acid signal peptide and a 741 amino acid propeptide, with the mature VWF comprising 2050

[0089]      Defects in VWF are causal to Von Willebrand disease (VWD), which is
characterized by a more or less pronounced bleeding phenotype. VWD type 3 is the most
severe form, in which VWF is completely missing, and VWD type 1 relates to a quantitative
loss of VWF and its phenotype can be very mild. VWD type 2 relates to qualitative defects
of VWF and can be as severe as VWD type 3. VWD type 2 has many sub forms, some being
associated with the loss or the decrease of high molecular weight multimers. Von Willebrand
disease type 2a (VWD-2A) is characterized by a loss of both intermediate and large
multimers. VWD-2B is characterized by a loss of highest-molecular-weight multimers.
Other diseases and disorders related to VWF are known in the art.
[0090]      The polynucleotide and amino acid sequences of prepro-VWF are available at
GenBank Accession Nos. NM_000552 and NP_000543, respectively.

                                        A.      Polypeptides
[0092]      In one aspect, the starting material of the present invention is a protein or
polypeptide. As described herein, the term therapeutic protein refers to any therapeutic
protein molecule which exhibits biological activity that is associated with the therapeutic
protein. In one embodiment of the invention, the therapeutic protein molecule is a full-length
protein.
[0093]      Therapeutic protein molecules contemplated include full-length proteins, precursors
of full length proteins, biologically active subunits or fragments of full length proteins, as
well as biologically active derivatives and variants of any of these forms of therapeutic
proteins. Thus, therapeutic protein include those that (1) have an amino acid sequence that
has greater than about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%,
about 90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about
97%, about 98% or about 99% or greater amino acid sequence identity, over a region of at
least about 25, about 50, about 100, about 200, about 300, about 400, or more amino acids, to
a polypeptide encoded by a referenced nucleic acid or an amino acid sequence described
herein; and/or (2) specifically bind to antibodies, e.g., polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies,
generated against an immunogen comprising a referenced amino acid sequence as described
herein, an immunogenic fragment thereof, and/or a conservatively modified variant thereof.
[0094]      According to the present invention, the term "recombinant therapeutic protein"
includes any therapeutic protein obtained via recombinant DNA technology. In certain
embodiments, the term encompasses proteins as described herein.
[0095]      As used herein, "endogenous therapeutic protein" includes a therapeutic protein
which originates from the mammal intended to receive treatment. The term also includes
therapeutic protein transcribed from a transgene or any other foreign DNA present in said
mammal. As used herein, "exogenous therapeutic protein " includes a blood coagulation
protein which does not originate from the mammal intended to receive treatment.
[0096]      As used herein, "plasma-derived blood coagulation protein " or "plasmatic"
includes all forms of the protein found in blood obtained from a mammal having the property
participating in the coagulation pathway.
                                                 - 51 -

[0097]     As used herein "biologically active derivative" or "biologically active variant"
includes any derivative or variant of a molecule having substantially the same functional
and/or biological properties of said molecule, such as binding properties, and/or the same
structural basis, such as a peptidic backbone or a basic polymeric unit.
[0098]     An "analog," such as a "variant" or a "derivative," is a compound substantially
similar in structure and having the same biological activity, albeit in certain instances to a
differing degree, to a naturally-occurring molecule. For example, a polypeptide variant refers
to a polypeptide sharing substantially similar structure and having the same biological
activity as a reference polypeptide. Variants or analogs differ in the composition of their
amino acid sequences compared to the naturally-occurring polypeptide from which the
analog is derived, based on one or more mutations involving (i) deletion of one or more
amino acid residues at one or more termini of the polypeptide and/or one or more internal
regions of the naturally-occurring polypeptide sequence (e.g., fragments), (ii) insertion or
addition of one or more amino acids at one or more termini (typically an "addition" or
"fusion") of the polypeptide and/or one or more internal regions (typically an "insertion") of
the naturally-occurring polypeptide sequence or (iii) substitution of one or more amino acids
for other amino acids in the naturally-occurring polypeptide sequence. By way of example, a
"derivative" is a type of analog and refers to a polypeptide sharing the same or substantially
similar structure as a reference polypeptide that has been modified, e.g., chemically.
[0099]     A variant polypeptide is a type of analog polypeptide and includes insertion
variants, wherein one or more amino acid residues are added to a therapeutic protein amino
acid sequence of the invention. Insertions may be located at either or both termini of the
protein, and/or may be positioned within internal regions of the therapeutic protein amino
acid sequence. Insertion variants, with additional residues at either or both termini, include
for example, fusion proteins and proteins including amino acid tags or other amino acid
labels. In one aspect, the blood coagulation protein molecule optionally contains an N
terminal Met, especially when the molecule is expressed recombinantly in a bacterial cell
such as E. coli.
[00100]     In deletion variants, one or more amino acid residues in a therapeutic protein
polypeptide as described herein are removed. Deletions can be effected at one or both
termini of the therapeutic protein polypeptide, and/or with removal of one or more residues
within the therapeutic protein amino acid sequence. Deletion variants, therefore, include
fragments of a therapeutic protein polypeptide sequence.
                                               - 52 -

[00101]     In substitution variants, one or more amino acid residues of a therapeutic protein
polypeptide are removed and replaced with alternative residues. In one aspect, the
substitutions are conservative in nature and conservative substitutions of this type are well
known in the art. Alternatively, the invention embraces substitutions that are also non
conservative. Exemplary conservative substitutions are described in Lehninger,
[Biochemistry, 2nd Edition; Worth Publishers, Inc., New York (1975), pp. 7 1-77] and are set
out immediately below.

[00103]     Nucleic acids encoding a therapeutic protein of the invention include, for example
and without limitation, genes, pre-mRNAs, mRNAs, cDNAs, polymorphic variants, alleles,
synthetic and naturally-occurring mutants.
[00104]     Polynucleotides encoding a therapeutic protein of the invention also include,
without limitation, those that (1) specifically hybridize under stringent hybridization
conditions to a nucleic acid encoding a referenced amino acid sequence as described herein,
and conservatively modified variants thereof; (2) have a nucleic acid sequence that has
greater than about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, or higher nucleotide
sequence identity, over a region of at least about 25, about 50, about 100, about 150, about
200, about 250, about 500, about 1000, or more nucleotides (up to the full length sequence of

1218 nucleotides of the mature protein), to a reference nucleic acid sequence as described
herein. Exemplary "stringent hybridization" conditions include hybridization at 42oC in 50%
formamide, 5X SSC, 20 mM Na-P04, pH 6.8; and washing in 1X SSC at 55oC for 30
minutes. It is understood that variation in these exemplary conditions can be made based on
the length and GC nucleotide content of the sequences to be hybridized. Formulas standard
in the art are appropriate for determining appropriate hybridization conditions. See
Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (Second ed., Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory Press, 1989) §§ 9.47-9.5 1.
[00105]      A "naturally-occurring" polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence is typically
derived from a mammal including, but not limited to, primate, e.g., human; rodent, e.g., rat,
mouse, hamster; cow, pig, horse, sheep, or any mammal. The nucleic acids and proteins of
the invention can be recombinant molecules (e.g., heterologous and encoding the wild type
sequence or a variant thereof, or non-naturally occurring).
                           C.       Production of therapeutic proteins
[00106]      Production of a therapeutic protein includes any method known in the art for (i)
the production of recombinant DNA by genetic engineering, (ii) introducing recombinant
DNA into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells by, for example and without limitation,
transfection, electroporation or microinjection, (iii) cultivating said transformed cells, (iv)
expressing therapeutic protein, e.g. constitutively or upon induction, and (v) isolating said
blood coagulation protein, e.g. from the culture medium or by harvesting the transformed
cells, in order to obtain purified therapeutic protein.
[00107]      In other aspects, the therapeutic protein is produced by expression in a suitable
prokaryotic or eukaryotic host system characterized by producing a pharmacologically
acceptable blood coagulation protein molecule. Examples of eukaryotic cells are mammalian
cells, such as CHO, COS, HEK 293, BHK, SK-Hep, and HepG2.
[00108]      A wide variety of vectors are used for the preparation of the therapeutic protein
and are selected from eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression vectors. Examples of vectors for
prokaryotic expression include plasmids such as, and without limitation, pRSET, pET, and
pBAD, wherein the promoters used in prokaryotic expression vectors include one or more of,
and without limitation, lac, trc, trp, recA, or araBAD. Examples of vectors for eukaryotic
expression include: (i) for expression in yeast, vectors such as, and without limitation, pAO,
pPIC, pYES, or pMET, using promoters such as, and without limitation, AOX1, GAP,
                                                - 55 -

pMT, pAc5, pIB, pMIB, or pBAC, using promoters such as and without limitation PH, p10,
MT, Ac5, OpIE2, gp64, or polh, and (iii) for expression in mammalian cells, vectors such as
and without limitation pSVL, pCMV, pRc/RSV, pcDNA3, or pBPV, and vectors derived
from, in one aspect, viral systems such as and without limitation vaccinia virus, adeno
associated viruses, herpes viruses, or retroviruses, using promoters such as and without
limitation CMV, SV40, EF-l, UbC, RSV, ADV, BPV, and J-actin.
                                      D.     Administration
[00109]      In one embodiment a conjugated therapeutic protein of the present invention may
be administered by injection, such as intravenous, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal injection.
[00110]      To administer compositions comprising a conjugated therapeutic protein of the
present invention to human or test animals, in one aspect, the compositions comprise one or
more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The terms "pharmaceutically" or
"pharmacologically acceptable" refer to molecular entities and compositions that are stable,
inhibit protein degradation such as aggregation and cleavage products, and in addition do not
produce allergic, or other adverse reactions when administered using routes well-known in
the art, as described below. "Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers" include any and all
clinically useful solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents,
isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like, including those agents disclosed above.
[00111]      As used herein, "effective amount" includes a dose suitable for treating a disease
or disorder or ameliorating a symptom of a disease or disorder. In one embodiment,
"effective amount" includes a dose suitable for treating a mammal having a bleeding disorder
as described herein.
[00112]      The compositions may be administered orally, topically, transdermally,
parenterally, by inhalation spray, vaginally, rectally, or by intracranial injection. The term
parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular,
intracisternal injection, or infusion techniques. Administration by intravenous, intradermal,
intramuscular, intramammary, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, retrobulbar, intrapulmonary
injection and or surgical implantation at a particular site is contemplated as well. Generally,
compositions are essentially free of pyrogens, as well as other impurities that could be
harmful to the recipient.
                                               - 56 -

[00113]     Single or multiple adninstrations of the compositions can be carried out with the
dose levels and pattern being selected by the treating physician. For the prevention or
treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage will depend on the type of disease to be treated,
as described above, the severity and course of the disease, whether drug is administered for
preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and
response to the drug, and the discretion of the attending physician.
[00114]     The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an
effective amount of a conjugated therapeutic protein as defined herein. The pharmaceutical
composition may further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, salt, buffer,
or excipient. The pharmaceutical composition can be used for treating the above-defined
bleeding disorders. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be a solution or a
 lyophilized product. Solutions of the pharmaceutical composition may be subjected to any
 suitable lyophilization process.
 [00115]     As an additional aspect, the invention includes kits which comprise a composition
 of the invention packaged in a manner which facilitates its use for administration to subjects.
 In one embodiment, such a kit includes a compound or composition described herein (e.g., a
                                                                                             as a
 composition comprising a conjugated therapeutic protein), packaged in a container such
 sealed bottle or vessel, with a label affixed to the container or included in the package that
 describes use of the compound or composition in practicing the method. In one embodiment,
 the kit contains a first container having a composition comprising a conjugated therapeutic
                                                                                                for
 protein and a second container having a physiologically acceptable reconstitution solution
 the composition in the first container. In one aspect, the compound or composition is
 packaged in a unit dosage form. The kit may further include a device suitable for
 administering the composition according to a specific route of administration. Preferably, the
 kit contains a label that describes use of the therapeutic protein or peptide composition.
  WATER SOLUBLE POLYMERS
  [00116]    In one aspect, a therapeutic protein derivative (i.e., a conjugated therapeutic
  protein) molecule provided is bound to a water-soluble polymer including, but not limited to,
  polyethylene glycol (PEG), branched PEG, polysialic acid (PSA), hydroxyalkyl starch
  (HAS), hydroxylethyl starch (HES), carbohydrate, polysaccharides, pullulan, chitosan,
  hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, starch, dextran, carboxymethyl
  dextran, polyalkylene oxide (PAO), polyalkylene glycol (PAG), polypropylene glycol (PPG)

polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyphosphazene, polyoxazoline, polyethylene-co-maleic acid
anhydride, polystyrene-co-maleic acid anhydride, poly(1-hydroxymethylethylene
hydroxymethylformal) (PHF), 2-methacryloyloxy-2'-ethyltrimethylammoniumphosphate
(MPC). In one embodiment of the invention, the water soluble polymer is consisting of sialic
acid molecule having a molecular weight range of 350 to 120,000, 500 to 100,000,1000 to
80,000, 1500 to 60,000, 2,000 to 45,000 Da, 3,000 to 35,000 Da, and 5,000 to 25,000 Da.
The coupling of the water soluble polymer can be carried out by direct coupling to the protein
or via linker molecules. One example of a chemical linker is MBPH (4-[4-N
Maleimidophenyl]butyric acid hydrazide) containing a carbohydrate-selective hydrazide and
a sulfhydryl-reactive maleimide group (Chamow et al., J Biol Chem 1992;267:15916-22).
Other exemplary and preferred linkers are described below.
[00117]     In one embodiment, the derivative retains the full functional activity of native
therapeutic protein products, and provides an extended half-life in vivo, as compared to
native therapeutic protein products. In another embodiment, the derivative retains at least

96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, or 150 percent (%) biological activity relative to
native blood coagulation protein. In a related aspect, the biological activities of the derivative
and native blood coagulation protein are determined by the ratios of chromogenic activity to
blood coagulation factor antigen value (blood coagulation factor:Chr: blood coagulation
factor:Ag). In still another embodiment of the invention, the half-life of the construct is
decreased or increased 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or
10-fold relative to the in vivo half-life of native therapeutic protein.
                                     A. Sialic acid and PSA
[00118]     PSAs consist of polymers (generally homopolymers) of N-acetylneuraminic acid.
The secondary amino group normally bears an acetyl group, but it may instead bear a
glycolyl group. Possible substituents on the hydroxyl groups include acetyl, lactyl, ethyl,
sulfate, and phosphate groups.

[00119]     Structure of sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid)
[00120]     PSAs and mPSAs generally comprise linear polymers consisting essentially of N
acetylneuraminic acid moieties linked by 2,8- or 2,9- glycosidic linkages or combinations of
these (e.g. alternating 2,8- and 2,9- linkages). In particularly preferred PSAs and mPSAs, the
glycosidic linkages are ax-2,8. Such PSAs and mPSAs are conveniently derived from
colominic acids, and are referred to herein as "CAs" and "mCAs". Typical PSAs and mPSAs
comprise at least 2, preferably at least 5, more preferably at least 10 and most preferably at
least 20 N-acetylneuraminic acid moieties. Thus, they may comprise from 2 to 300 N
acetylneuraminic acid moieties, preferably from 5 to 200 N-acetylneuraminic acid moieties,
or most preferably from 10 to 100 N-acetylneuraminic acid moieties. PSAs and CAs
preferably are essentially free of sugar moieties other than N-acetylneuraminic acid. Thus
PSAs and CAs preferably comprise at least 90 %, more preferably at least 95 % and most
preferably at least 98 % N-acetylneuraminic acid moieties.
[00121]     Where PSAs and CAs comprise moieties other than N-acetylneuraminic acid (as,
for example in mPSAS and mCAs) these are preferably located at one or both of the ends of
the polymer chain. Such "other" moieties may, for example, be moieties derived from
terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid moieties by oxidation or reduction.
[00122]     For example, WO-A-0187922 describes such mPSAs and mCAs in which the non
reducing terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid unit is converted to an aldehyde group by reaction
with sodium periodate. Additionally, WO 2005/016974 describes such mPSAs and mCAs in
which the reducing terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid unit is subjected to reduction to
reductively open the ring at the reducing terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid unit, whereby a
vicinal diol group is formed, followed by oxidation to convert the vicinal diol group to an
aldehyde group.

[00123]     Sialic acid rich glycoproteins bind selectin in humans and other organisms. They
play an important role in human influenza infections. E.g., sialic acid can hide mannose
antigens on the surface of host cells or bacteria from mannose-binding lectin. This prevents
activation of complement. Sialic acids also hide the penultimate galactose residue thus
preventing rapid clearance of the glycoprotein by the galactose receptor on the hepatic
parenchymal cells.

[00124]     Structure of colominic acid (homopolymer of N-acetylneuraminic acid)
[00125]     Colominic acids (a sub-class of PSAs) are homopolymers of N-acetylneuraminic
acid (NANA) with a (2->8) ketosidic linkage, and are produced, inter alia, by particular
strains of Escherichia coli possessing Ki antigen. Colominic acids have many physiological
functions. They are important as a raw material for drugs and cosmetics.
[00126]     Comparative studies in vivo with polysialylated and unmodified asparaginase
revealed that polysialylation increased the half-life of the enzyme (Fernandes and
Gregoriadis, Biochimica Biophysica Acta 1341: 26-34, 1997).
[00127]     As used herein, "sialic acid moieties" includes sialic acid monomers or polymers
("polysaccharides") which are soluble in an aqueous solution or suspension and have little or
no negative impact, such as side effects, to mammals upon administration of the PSA-blood
coagulation protein conjugate in a pharmaceutically effective amount. The polymers are
characterized, in one aspect, as having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100,
200, 300, 400, or 500 sialic acid units. In certain aspects, different sialic acid units are
combined in a chain.
                                               - 60 -

[00128]      In one embodiment of the invention, the sialic acid portion of the polysaccharide
compound is highly hydrophilic, and in another embodiment the entire compound is highly
hydrophilic. Hydrophilicity is conferred primarily by the pendant carboxyl groups of the
sialic acid units, as well as the hydroxyl groups. The saccharide unit may contain other
functional groups, such as, amine, hydroxyl or sulphate groups, or combinations thereof.
These groups may be present on naturally-occurring saccharide compounds, or introduced
into derivative polysaccharide compounds.
[00129]      The naturally occurring polymer PSA is available as a polydisperse preparation
showing a broad size distribution (e.g. Sigma C-5762) and high polydispersity (PD). Because
the polysaccharides are usually produced in bacteria carrying the inherent risk of copurifying
endotoxins, the purification of long sialic acid polymer chains may raise the probability of
increased endotoxin content. Short PSA molecules with 1-4 sialic acid units can also be
synthetically prepared (Kang SH et al., Chem Commun. 2000;227-8; Ress DK and Linhardt
RJ, Current Organic Synthesis. 2004;1:31-46), thus minimizing the risk of high endotoxin
levels. However PSA preparations with a narrow size distribution and low polydispersity,
which are also endotoxin-free, can now be manufactured. Polysaccharide compounds of
particular use for the invention are, in one aspect, those produced by bacteria. Some of these
naturally-occurring polysaccharides are known as glycolipids. In one embodiment, the
polysaccharide compounds are substantially free of terminal galactose units.
                        B.      Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and Pegylation
[00130]      In certain aspects, therapeutic proteins are conjugated to a water soluble polymer
by any of a variety of chemical methods (Roberts JM et al., Advan Drug Delivery Rev
2002;54:459-76). For example, in one embodiment a therapeutic protein is modified by the
conjugation of PEG to free amino groups of the protein using N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)
esters. In another embodiment the water soluble polymer, for example PEG, is coupled to
free SH groups using maleimide chemistry or the coupling of PEG hydrazides or PEG amines
to carbohydrate moieties of the therapeutic protein after prior oxidation.
[00131]      The conjugation is in one aspect performed by direct coupling (or coupling via
linker systems) of the water soluble polymer to a therapeutic protein under formation of
stable bonds. In addition degradable, releasable or hydrolysable linker systems are used in
certain aspects the present invention (Tsubery et al. J Biol Chem 2004;279:38118-24 /

[00132]     In one embodiment of the invention, a therapeutic protein is modified via lysine
residues by use of polyethylene glycol derivatives containing an active N
hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS) such as succinimidyl succinate, succinimidyl glutarate or
succinimidyl propionate. These derivatives react with the lysine residues of the therapeutic
protein under mild conditions by forming a stable amide bond. In one embodiment of the
invention, the chain length of the PEG derivative is 5,000 Da. Other PEG derivatives with
chain lengths of 500 to 2,000 Da, 2,000 to 5,000 Da, greater than 5,000 up to 10,000 Da or
greater than 10,000 up to 20,000 Da, or greater than 20,000 up to 150,000 Da are used in
various embodiments, including linear and branched structures.
[00133]     Alternative methods for the PEGylation of amino groups are, without limitation,
the chemical conjugation with PEG carbonates by forming urethane bonds, or the reaction
with aldehydes or ketones by reductive amination forming secondary amide bonds.
[00134]     In one embodiment of the present invention a therapeutic protein molecule is
chemically modified using PEG derivatives that are commercially available. These PEG
derivatives in alternative aspects have linear or branched structures. Examples of PEG
derivatives containing NHS groups are listed below.

[00140]     Surprisingly, the PEGylated therapeutic protein of this invention exhibits
functional activity, combined with an extended half-life in vivo. In addition the PEGylated
rFVIII, FVIIa, FIX, or other blood coagulation factor seems to be more resistant against
thrombin inactivation.
            C.      Hydroxyalkyl starch (HAS) and hydroxylethyl starch (HES)
[00141]     In various embodiments of the present invention, a therapeutic protein molecule is
chemically modified using hydroxyalkyl starch (HAS) or hydroxylethyl starch (HES) or
derivatives thereof.
[00142]     HES is a derivative of naturally occurring amylopectin and is degraded by alpha
amylase in the body. HES is a substituted derivative of the carbo- hydrate polymer
amylopectin, which is present in corn starch at a concentration of up to 95 % by weight. HES
exhibits advantageous biological properties and is used as a blood volume replacement agent
and in hemodilution therapy in the clinics (Sommermeyer et al., 1987,
Krankenhauspharmazie, 8 (8), 271-278; and Weidler et al., 1991, Arzneim.-Forschung/Drug
Res. g 419 494-498).
[00143]     Amylopectin consists of glucose moieties, wherein in the main chain alpha-1,4
glycosidic bonds are present and at the branching sites alpha-1, 6-glycosidic bonds are found.
The physical-chemical properties of this molecule are mainly determined by the type of
                                                        - 65 -

glycosidic bonds. Due to the nicked alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond, helical structures with about
six glucose-monomers per turn are produced. The physico- chemical as well as the
biochemical properties of the polymer can be modified via substitution. The introduction of a
hydroxyethyl group can be achieved via alkaline hydroxyethylation. By adapting the reaction
conditions it is possible to exploit the different reactivity of the respective hydroxy group in
the unsubstituted glucose monomer with respect to a hydroxyethylation. Owing to this fact,
the skilled person is able to influence the substitution pattern to a limited extent.
[00144]     HAS refers to a starch derivative which has been substituted by at least one
hydroxyalkyl group. Therefore, the term hydroxyalkyl starch is not limited to compounds
where the terminal carbohydrate moiety comprises hydroxyalkyl groups RI, R2, and/or R3,
but also refers to compounds in which at least one hydroxy group present anywhere, either in
the terminal carbohydrate moiety and/or in the remaining part of the starch molecule, HAS',
is substituted by a hydroxyalkyl group R1, R2, or R3.
[00145]     The alkyl group may be a linear or branched alkyl group which may be suitably
substituted. Preferably, the hydroxyalkyl group contains 1 to 10 carbon atoms, more
preferably from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more preferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and even
more preferably 2-4 carbon atoms. "Hydroxyalkyl starch" therefore preferably comprises
hydroxyethyl starch, hydroxypropyl starch and hydroxybutyl starch, wherein hydroxyethyl
starch and hydroxypropyl starch are particularly preferred.
[00146]     Hydroxyalkyl starch comprising two or more different hydroxyalkyl groups is also
comprised in the present invention. The at least one hydroxyalkyl group comprised in HAS
may contain two or more hydroxy groups. According to one embodiment, the at least one
hydroxyalkyl group comprised HAS contains one hydroxy group.
                                                - 66 -

[00147]     The term HAS also includes derivatives wherein the alkyl group is mono-or
polysubstituted. In one embodiment, the alkyl group is substituted with a halogen, especially
fluorine, or with an aryl group, provided that the HAS remains soluble in water.
Furthermore, the terminal hydroxy group a of hydroxyalkyl group may be esterified or
etherified. HAS derivatives are described in WO/2004/024776, which is incorporated by
reference in its entirety.
                                   D. Methods of attachment
[00148]     A therapeutic protein may be covalently linked to the polysaccharide compounds
by any of various techniques known to those of skill in the art. In various aspects of the
invention, sialic acid moieties are bound to a therapeutic protein, e.g., FIX, FVIII, FVIa or
VWF, for example by the method described in US Patent No. 4,356,170, which is herein
incorporated by reference.
[00149]     Other techniques for coupling PSA to polypeptides are also known and
contemplated by the invention. For example, US Publication No. 2007/0282096 describes
conjugating an amine or hydrazide derivative of, e.g., PSA, to proteins. In addition, US
Publication No. 2007/0191597 describes PSA derivatives containing an aldehyde group for
reaction with substrates (e.g., proteins) at the reducing end. These references are
incorporated by reference in their entireties.
[00150]     Various methods are disclosed at column 7, line 15, through column 8, line 5 of
U.S. Patent No. 5,846,951 (incorporated by reference in its entirety). Exemplary techniques
include linkage through a peptide bond between a carboxyl group on one of either the blood
coagulation protein or polysaccharide and an amine group of the blood coagulation protein or
polysaccharide, or an ester linkage between a carboxyl group of the blood coagulation protein
or polysaccharide and a hydroxyl group of the therapeutic protein or polysaccharide. Another
linkage by which the therapeutic protein is covalently bonded to the polysaccharide
compound is via a Schiff base, between a free amino group on the blood coagulation protein
being reacted with an aldehyde group formed at the non-reducing end of the polysaccharide
by periodate oxidation (Jennings HJ and Lugowski C, J Immunol. 198 1;127:1011-8;
Fernandes Al and Gregoriadis G, Biochim Biophys Acta. 1997;1341;26-34). The generated
Schiff base is in one aspect stabilized by specific reduction with NaCNBH3 to form a
secondary amine. An alternative approach is the generation of terminal free amino groups in
the PSA by reductive amination with NH4C1 after prior oxidation. Bifunctional reagents can
                                                - 67 -

be used for linking two amino or two hydroxyl groups. For example, PSA containing an
amino group is coupled to amino groups of the protein with reagents like BS3
(Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate / Pierce, Rockford, IL). In addition heterobifunctional cross
linking reagents like Sulfo-EMCS (N-r-Maleimidocaproyloxy) sulfosuccinimide ester /
Pierce) is used for instance to link amine and thiol groups.
[00151]     In another approach, a PSA hydrazide is prepared and coupled to the carbohydrate
moiety of the protein after prior oxidation and generation of aldehyde functions.
[00152]     As described above, a free amine group of the therapeutic protein reacts with the
1-carboxyl group of the sialic acid residue to form a peptidyl bond or an ester linkage is
formed between the 1-carboxylic acid group and a hydroxyl or other suitable active group on
a blood coagulation protein. Alternatively, a carboxyl group forms a peptide linkage with
deacetylated 5-amino group, or an aldehyde group of a molecule of a therapeutic protein
forms a Schiff base with the N-deacetylated 5-amino group of a sialic acid residue.
[00153]     Alternatively, the polysaccharide compound is associated in a non-covalent
manner with a therapeutic protein. For example, the polysaccharide compound and the
pharmaceutically active compound are in one aspect linked via hydrophobic interactions.
Other non-covalent associations include electrostatic interactions, with oppositely charged
ions attracting each other.
[00154]     In various embodiments, the therapeutic protein is linked to or associated with the
polysaccharide compound in stoichiometric amounts (e.g., 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7, 1:7,
1:8, 1:9, or 1:10, etc.). In various embodiments, 1-6, 7-12 or 13-20 polysaccharides are
linked to the blood coagulation protein. In still other embodiments, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or more polysaccharides are linked to the blood
coagulation protein.
[00155]     In various embodiments, the therapeutic protein is modified to introduce
glycosylation sites (i.e., sites other than the native glycosylation sites). Such modification
may be accomplished using standard molecular biological techniques known in the art.
Moreover, the therapeutic protein, prior to conjugation to a water soluble polymer via one or
more carbohydrate moieties, may be glycosylated in vivo or in vitro. These glycosylated
sites can serve as targets for conjugation of the proteins with water soluble polymers (US

For example, a protein that is not naturally glycoslyated in vivo (e.g., a protein that is not a
glycoprotein) may be modified as described above.
                                      E. Aminooxy linkage
[00156]      In one embodiment of the invention, the reaction of hydroxylamine or
hydroxylamine derivatives with aldehydes (e g., on a carbohydrate moiety following
oxidation by sodium periodate) to form an oxime group is applied to the preparation of
conjugates of blood coagulation protein. For example, a glycoprotein (e.g., a therapeutic
                                                                                    agent such as
protein according to the present invention) is first oxidized with an oxidizing
 sodium periodate (NaIO4) (Rothfus JA et Smith EL., J Biol Chem 1963, 238, 1402-10; and
Van Lenten L and Ashwell G., J Biol Chem 1971, 246, 1889-94). The periodate oxidation of
                                                                                   the oxidation of
 glycoproteins is based on the classical Malaprade reaction described in 1928,
 vicinal diols with periodate to form an active aldehyde group (Malaprade L., Analytical
                                                                                  for such an
 application, Bull Soc Chim France, 1928, 43, 683-96). Additional examples
 oxidizing agent are lead tetraacetate ( Pb(OAc)4 ), manganese acetate ( MnO(Ac)3 ),
                                                                                            cobalt
 acetate (Co(OAc)2 ), thallium acetate (TIOAc), cerium sulfate (Ce(S04)2 ) (US 4,367,309)
 or potassium perruthenate ( KRuO4 ) (Marko et al., J Am Chem Soc 1997,119, 12661-2). By
                                                                                           diols in
 "oxidizing agent" a mild oxidizing compound which is capable of oxidizing vicinal
 carbohydrates, thereby generating active aldehyde groups under physiological reaction
 conditions is meant.
 [00157]      The second step is the coupling of the polymer containing an aminooxy group to
                                                                                        of the
 the oxidized carbohydrate moiety to form an oxime linkage. In one embodiment
                                                                                       nucleophilic
 invention, this step can be carried out in the presence of catalytic amounts of the
 catalyst aniline or aniline derivatives (Dirksen A et Dawson PE, Bioconjugate Chem. 2008;
                                                                                        accelerates
  Zeng Y et al., Nature Methods 2009;6:207-9). The aniline catalysis dramatically
  the oxime ligation allowing the use of very low concentrations of the reagents. In another
                                                                                                    to

 NUCLEOPHILIC CATALYSTS
 [00160]     As decribed herein, the conjugation of water soluble polymers to therapeutic
 proteins can be catalyzed by aniline. Aniline strongly catalyzes aqueous reactions of
 aldehydes and ketones with amines to form stable imines such as hydrazones and oximes.
 The following diagram compares an uncatalyzed versus the aniline-catalyzed oxime ligation
 reaction (Kohler JJ, ChemBioChem 2009; 10:2147-50):

[00161]     However, considering the numerous health risks associated with aniline,
alternative catalysts are desirable. The present invention provides aniline derivatives as
alternative oxime ligation catalysts. Such aniline derivatives include, but are not limited to,
o-amino benzoic acid, m-amino benzoic acid, p-amino benzoic acid, sulfanilic acid, o
                                                      - 71 -
aminobenzamide, o-toluidine, m-toluidine, p-toluidine, o-anisidine, m-anisidine, and p
anisidine.
[00162]     In one embodiment of the invention, m-toluidine (aka meta-toluidine, m
methylaniline, 3-methylaniline, or 3 -amino-1I-methylbenzene) is used to catalyze the
conjugation reactions described herein. M-toluidine and aniline have similar physical
properties and essentially the same pKa value (m-toluidine: pKa 4.73, aniline: pKa 4.63).

[00163]      The nucleophilic catalysts of the invention are useful for oxime ligation (e.g, using
aminooxy linkage) or hydrazone formation (e.g., using hydrazide chemistry). In various
embodiments of the invention, the nucleophilic catalyst is provided in the conjugation
reaction at a concentration of of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0,

provided between 1 to 10 mM. In various embodiments of the invention, the pH range of
conjugation reaction is 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0 and 7.5. In one embodiment, the pH is

PURIFICATION OF CONJUGATED PROTEINS
[00164]      In various embodiments, purification of a protein that has been incubated with an
oxidizing agent and/or a therapeutic protein that has been conjugated with a water soluble
polymer according to the present disclosure, is desired. Numerous purification techniques are
known in the art and include, without limitation, chromatographic methods such as ion
exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, size exclusion
chromatography and affinity chromatography or combinations thereof, filtration methods,
and precipitation methods (Guide to Protein Purification, Meth. Enzymology Vol 463 (edited

(Tetrahedron 1997; 53:5485-92) in a two step organic synthesis as outlined in Example 1.
Step 1:
[00173]      To a solution of Endo-N-hydroxy-5-norbonene-2,3- dicarboxiimide (59.0 g;
1.00 eq) in 700 ml anhydrous N,N-dimetylformamide anhydrous K 2 CO 3 (45.51 g; 1.00 eq)
and 2,2-dichlorodiethylether (15.84 ml; 0.41 eq) were added. The reaction mixture was
stirred for 22 h at 50C. The mixture was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The
residue was suspended in 2 L dichloromethane and extracted two times with saturated
aqueous NaCl-solution (each 1 L). The Dichloromethane layer was dried over Na 2 SO 4 and
then evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure and dried in high vacuum to give 64.5 g of
3-oxapentane-1,5-dioxy-endo-2',3'-dicarboxydiimidenorbornene as a white-yellow solid
(intermediate 1).
Step2:
[00174]      To a solution of intermediate 1 (64.25 g; 1.00 eq) in 800 ml anhydrous Ethanol,
31.0 ml Hydrazine hydrate (4.26 eq) were added. The reaction mixture was then refluxed for
2 hrs. The mixture was concentrated to the half of the starting volume by evaporating the
solvent under reduced pressure. The occurring precipitate was filtered off. The remaining
ethanol layer was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue containing the
crude product 3-oxa-pentane -1,5-dioxyamine was dried in vacuum to yield 46.3 g. The
crude product was further purified by column chromatography (Silicagel 60; isocratic elution
with Dichloromethane/Methanol mixture, 9/1) to yield 11.7 g of the pure final product 3-oxa
pentane -1,5-dioxyamine.

India (Pune, India) was dissolved in 16 ml 50 mM phospate buffer pH 6.0. Then 170 mg 3
oxa-pentane-1,5-dioxyamine was given to the reaction mixture. After shaking for 2 hrs at RT
78.5 mg sodium cyanoborohydride was added and the reaction was performed for 18 hours
over night. The reaction mixture was then subjected to a ultrafiltration/diafiltration procedure

[00176]     1290 mg of oxidized PSA (MW = 20 kD) obtained from the Serum Institute of
India (Pune, India) was dissolved in 25 ml 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.0 (Bufffer A).
Then 209 mg 3-oxa-pentane-1,5-dioxyamine was given to the reaction mixture. After
shaking for 1 h at RT 101 mg sodium cyanoborohydride was added and the reaction was
performed for 3 hours. Then the mixture was then subjected to a weak anion exchange
chromatography step employing a Fractogel EMD DEAE 650-M chromatography gel
(column dimension: XK26/135). The reaction mixture was diluted with 110 ml Buffer A and
loaded onto the DEAE column pre-equilibrated with Buffer A at a flow rate of 1 cm/min.
Then the column was washed with 20 CV Buffer B (20 mM Hepes, pH 6.0) to remove free 3
oxa-pentane-1,5-dioxyamine and cyanide at a flow rate of 2 cm/min. The aminooxy-PSA
reagent was then eluted with a step gradient consisting of 67% Buffer B and 43% Buffer C
(20 mM Hepes, IM NaCl, pH 7.5). The eluate was concentrated by UF/DF using a 5 kD
                                              2
membrane made of polyether sulfone (50 cm , Millipore). The final diafiltration step was
performed against Buffer D (20mM Hepes, 90mM NaCl, pH 7.4). The preparation was
analytically characterized by measuring total PSA (Resorcinol assay) and total aminooxy
groups (TNBS assay) to determine the degree of modification. Furthermore the polydispersity

DEAE column pre-equilibrated with Buffer A at a flow rate of 1 cm/min. Then the column
was washed with 20 CV Buffer B (20 mM Hepes, pH 6.0) to remove free 3-oxa-pentane-1,5

nucleophilic catalysts (aniline, m-toluidine, o-anisidine, m-anisidine, o-aminobenzoic acid,
m-aminobenzoic acid, p-aminobenzoic acid, p-aminobenzamide, sulfanilic acid / standard
concentration: 10 mM) The reaction was carried out for 2 hrs in the dark at room
temperature under gentle stirring and quenched for 15 min at room temperature by the
addition of aqueous cysteine solution with a final concentration of 1 mM.
[00181]      The coupling efficiency was determined by SDS-PAGE using an Invitrogen X-cell
mini system. Samples were spiked with lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) buffer and denatured
for 10 min at 70'C. Then the samples were applied on 3-8 % TRIS-acetate gels and ran at
150 V for 60 min. Subsequently the gels were stained with Coomassie.
[00182]      In addition the samples were characterized by use of a SEC-HPLC system using a
Agilent 1200 HPLC system equipped with a Shodex KW 803 column under conditions as
previously described (Kolarich et al, Transfusion 2006;46:1959-77).
[00183]      50 l of samples were injected undiluted and eluted isocratically with a 0.22 pm
filtered solution of 20 mM NaH2PO4, 50 mM Na2SO4, pH 6.1 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.
The elution pattern was recorded at 280 nm.

(w/w) of Buffer A and Buffer B (20 mM Hepes, 5 mM CaCl 2 , 1.0 M NaCl, pH 7.0). Then
the oxidized rFVIII is eluted with a 50:50 (w/w) mixture of Buffer A and Buffer B followed
by a postelution step with 5 CV of Buffer B. The elution steps are carried out by use of a
flow rate of 1.0 cm/min.

described (Kolarich et al, Transfusion 2006;46:1959-77). It is shown that the preparation
contains no free interferon-gamma.
Method 4:
[00449]     Interferon-gamma is dissolved in or transferred to a reaction buffer (e.g. 50 mM
Hepes, 350 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM calcium chloride, pH 6.0) to get a final protein
concentration of 1.0 +/- 0.25 mg/ml. Then the pH of the solution is corrected to 6.0 by drop
wise addition of a 0.5 N aqueous HCl solution.
[00450]     Subsequently, the aminooxy-polysialic acid (PSA-ONH2) reagent is added in a
50-fold molar excess to this interferon-gamma solution within a maximum time period (t) of
15 minutes under gentle stirring. Then an aqueous m-toluidine solution (50 mM) is added
within 15 minutes to get a final concentration of 10 mM. Finally, a 40 mM aqueous sodium
periodate solution is added to give a concentration of 400 PM.
[00451]     The reaction mixture is incubated for 120 +/- 10 min. in the dark at a temperature
(T) of T= +22 +/- 2 0 C under gentle shaking. Then the reaction is stopped by the addition of
an aqueous L-cysteine solution (1 M) to give a final concentration of 10 mM in the reaction
mixture and incubation for 60 +/- 5 min.
[00452]     The obtained interferon-gamma conjugate is purified by ion-exchange
chromatography. The PSA-interferon-gamma containing fractions of the eluate are collected
and concentrated by ultra-/diafiltration (UF/DF) using a membrane made of regenerated
cellulose (Millipore).

[00492]     The retentate (approx. 7 ml), containing oxidized Prolia, is mixed with 2 ml of an
aqueous m-toluidine solution (50 mM) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then
aminooxy-PSA reagent with a MW of 20 kD (described above) is added to give a 5-fold
molar reagent excess. This mixture is incubated for 2.5 h at RT in the dark under gentle
stirring.
[00493]     The free Prolia is removed by means of cation exchange chromatography (CEC).
The reaction mixture is diluted with 20 ml Buffer A (50 mM Hepes, pH 6.5) and loaded onto
a 20 ml HiPrep SPFF 16/10 column (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT) pre-equilibrated with
Buffer A. Then the column is eluted with Buffer B (50 mM Hepes, 1 M NaCl, pH 6.5). Free
Prolia is eluted by washing the column with 25 % Buffer B and the conjugate at 50 % Buffer

Butyl FF 16/10 column (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT) pre-equilibrated with Buffer D (50

Subsequently, the conjugate is eluted with 100 % Buffer E (50 mM Hepes, pH 6.9). The
conjugate containing fractions are concentrated by UF/DF using a 10 kD membrane made of
regenerated cellulose (88 cm2, cut-off 10 kD, Millipore). The final diafiltration step is
performed against histidine buffer, pH 6.9 containing 150 mM NaCl. The preparation is
analytically characterized by measuring total protein (Bradford) and biological activity
according to methods known in the art. For the PSA-Prolia conjugate a specific activity of

analytically characterized by Size Exclusion HPLC using a Agilent 1200 HPLC system
equipped with a Shodex KW 803 column under conditions as previously described (Kolarich

histidine, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2). An aqueous sodium periodate solution (5 mM) is
then added and the reaction mixture is incubated for 1 h in the dark at 40 C under gentle
stirring and quenched for 15 min at room temperature by the addition of 7.5 P1 of a 1 M
aqueous cysteine solution. The mixture is subsequently subjected to UF/DF employing
Vivaspin centrifugal filtrators to remove excess periodate, quencher and the byproducts
thereof.
[00729]     The retentate containing oxidized Prolia is next mixed with an aqueous m
toluidine solution (50 mM) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Aminooxy-PEG
reagent with a MW of 20 kD is then added to give a 5-fold molar reagent excess. This
mixture is incubated for 2.5 h at room temperature in the dark under gentle stirring.
[00730]     Finally, the PEG- Prolia conjugate is purified by ion-exchange chromatography
(e.g., on Q-Sepharose FF). For example, 1.5 mg protein/ml gel is loaded on the column
equilibrated with 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.4 containing 5 mM CaCl2. The conjugate is
eluted with 50 mM Hepes buffer containing 5 mM CaCl2 and 500 mM sodium chloride, pH
