IP AUSTRALIA - INNOVATION PATENT APPLICATION                                   12th October 2017
Reference No. RSWPV001A
The intent of the innovation is to enable a spare wheel to be pressure checked and pumped from a
different location to the actual spare wheel and valve installation position.
Many spare wheels are difficult to pressure check or pump due to loading and packing of the boot
and even more so for utility vehicles where it is not uncommon to have the spare wheel mounted
under the load tray.
The location of the remote spare wheel pumping valve will be determined by each specific
application in conjunction with the client and will be installed in the vehicle at a location agreed with
the client.
