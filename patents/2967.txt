ABSTRACT
A chafe guard (40) includes sheet of flexible material (14) forming a tube (16)
having a tube longitudinal axis (43) and opposite tube openings (18, 20). The
tube has a main tube portion (44) of substantially fixed length between two
extremities (46, 48). The tube has a first extension tube portion (50) extending
downwardly, as shown, from a lower one of the extremities, parallel to the axis.
The first extension tube portion defines at least part of a first of the tube
openings, and has a varying length across the width of the tube, from a
maximum length at one lateral side (52) of the tube, and a decreasing length
towards an opposite lateral (56) side of the tube.

             Invention Title: Chafe guard
The invention is described in the following statement:

                                            2
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention relates to an item of clothing, in particular a chafe guard,
   which is typically worn as an undergarment.
 5
   BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
   Bandelettes are typically worn by users on their thighs not only as fashion or
   style undergarment items, but also to act as barriers to minimise chafing due to
10 rubbing together of the users' legs.
   Such a bandelette typically includes one or more sheets of flexible material
   configured in a cylindrical shape, with elasticised bands adjacent to the
   openings at the upper and lower ends of the tube, these bands being adapted
15 to grip on the user's leg.
   The materials used for such elasticised bands have also sometimes been
   suited to facilitate frictional engagement with the skin of the user to facilitate the
   gripping of the user's leg by the bandelette.
20
   A problem that has been experienced with known bandelettes is that they tend
   to slide down a user's leg as a result of the user bending over. As a user does
   so, changes in shape in the user's leg can occur due to muscle flexing and
   contraction. This, together with stretching or relaxing of the user's skin can
25 cause a bandelette to be pulled tight, especially in the direction along the length
   of the user's leg, and this can cause the elasticised bands to slide along the leg
   causing the bandelette as a whole to shift on the leg from a desirable position
   to an undesirable position.
30 It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate one or more
   disadvantage of the prior art or to provide a useful alternative thereto.

                                             3

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   Referring to the Figures 1 and 2, there is shown a bandelette 10 according to
   the prior art, the bandelette being disposed on a user's leg 12 viewed from the
15 side. The bandelette 10 includes a sheet of flexible material 14, such as textile,
   formed in a tubular shape, referred to as a tube 16 below. The bandelette 10
   can be used as a chafe guard.
   The tube 16 has an upper opening 18 and a lower opening 20. The length of
20 the material 14 between the openings 18, 20 is substantially constant around
   the tube 16.
   Adjacent to, and extending around, the upper opening 18 of the tube 16, there
   is an upper band 22 of elasticised material such as silicone (not shown in Figure
25 2). A similar, lower band 24 (also not shown in Figure 2) is located adjacent to,
   and extends around, the lower opening 20. In a preferred embodiment, the
   material of the bands is such that it sticks to the leg through frictional
   engagement.
30 Figure 1 shows the user's leg 12 and bandelette 10 when the user is standing
   upright. This is referred to below as the user's upright position.

                                             7
   When the user is bending over - referred to below as the user's bent over
   position - the user's leg 12 muscles flex. This causes the rear 12.1 and sides
   12.2 of the user's leg 12 to deflect and deform outwardly, and rearwardly as
 5 shown by way of example in the direction of the arrow 26, to the position 28 as
   indicated in dashed lines.
   It will be appreciated that as the user's leg 12 deflects in this manner, the skin
   of the leg stretches to some extent as indicated by the arrows 30. In this position
10 of the leg 12, due to the inherent tautness of the material 14 of the bandelette
   10, the material cannot stretch to the same extent as the skin. As a result, as
   the skin stretches as described above, the skin can be caused to slide upwardly
   and downwardly relative to the material of the bandelette and hence relative to
   the portions of the bands 22, 24 at the rear 12.1 of the leg 12.
15
   When the user again adopts the upright position, the leg 12 substantially takes
   its original shape, as it was before the user adopted the bent over position.
   However, at this stage, the user's skin will already have slid upwardly and
   downwardly relative to the material 14 of the bandelette 10. When the leg 12
20 takes its original shape, it unstretches as indicated by the arrows 32. As this
   occurs, due to the engagement between the portions of the bands 22, 24 at the
   rear 12.1 of the leg 12, the skin can pull the bands in the same directions 32 so
   that those portions of the bands ride over the user's leg, causing the bandelette
   10 to become bunched at the rear of the leg.
25
   Over time, provided the user remains upright, the bandelette 10 may adopt its
   non-scrunched condition due to the overall shape of the bandelette. More
   specifically, the material 14 of the whole bandelette 10 may cause it, when not
   being subjected to significant external forces for changing its shape, to adopt
30 its default, undeformed shape (except for the outward stretching over the girth
   of the leg 12).
   However, the repeated riding of the bands 22, 24 over the user's leg 12 that is
   likely to occur during use, is likely also to cause discomfort to the user, as well

                                              8
   as chafing and pulling of hairs on the user's leg. For example, as the bandelette
   10 rides and slides down the leg 12, it can leave the top of the thigh exposed
   so that the skin at the tops of the user's two thighs can rub together, causing
   chafing. The tautness of the material 14 of the bandelette 10 can contribute to
 5 a high likelihood of the bandelette sliding down, as movements of the leg can
   create stress on the bandelette.
   Referring to Figures 3 to 5, there is shown a chafe guard 40 in the form of a
   thigh guard, according to an embodiment of the invention. Parts of the chafe
10 guard 40 corresponding to parts of the prior art bandelette 10 of Figures 1 and
   2 are indicated by similar reference numerals as in those figures, but with the
   suffix ".1".
   The chafe guard 40 includes a sheet of flexible material 14.1 forming a tube
15 16.1. The tube 16.1 has a tube longitudinal direction 42 along an axis 43 of the
   tube, an upper tube opening 18.1 and an opposite, lower tube opening 20.1.
   The tube 16.1 has a main portion 44 having a lower extremity 46 and an upper
   extremity 48, and is of a particular fixed length.
20
   The tube 16.1 has a first, lower extension portion 50 which extends around part
   of the lower extremity 46 of the main portion 44. As can be seen, the lower
   extension portion 50 defines the lower tube opening 20.1.
25 The lower extension portion 50 has a length which decreases from a maximum
   length Li at a first lateral side 52 of the tube 16.1. As can be seen, because of
   the decreasing length, the lower extension portion 50 is wedge-shaped when
   viewed from the side as in Figure 3.
30 The tube 16.1 also has a second, upper extension portion 54 which extends
   around part of the upper extremity 48 of the main portion 50. As can be seen,
   the upper extension portion 54 defines the upper tube opening 18.1.

                                             9
   The upper extension portion 54 has a length which decreases from a maximum
   length L2 at a second lateral side 56 of the tube 16.1, opposite to the first lateral
   side 52. As in the case of the lower extension portion 50, because of the
   decreasing length of the upper extension portion 54, this portion is wedge
 5 shaped when viewed from the side as in Figure 3.
   The orientation of the upper extension portion 54 is reversed relative to that of
   the lower extension portion 50 so that the side 56 of the upper extension portion
   having its maximum length is on the opposite lateral side of the tube 16.1 to the
10 side 52 of the lower extension portion 50 having its maximum length. This gives
   the tube 16.1 a shape approximating that of a parallelogram when viewed from
   the side as in Figure 3.
   As in the case of the prior art bandelette 10, the chafe guard 40 of the present
15 invention has upper and lower bands 22.1, 24.1, of elasticised material such as
   silicone, which are adjacent to, and extend around, the upper and lower
   openings 18.1 and 20.1 respectively, of the tube 16.1.
    In another embodiment (not shown), instead of the upper and lower bands 22,
20 24, there may be provided a plurality of discrete elastomeric, preferably silicone,
   elements (e.g. studs or other protuberances, patches, etc) arranged in series
   relative to one another.
    In yet another embodiment (not shown), the upper and lower bands 22, 24, or
25 just one of these bands, is omitted so that the function of the respective band
   is performed by the material 14 of the chafe guard 40 at the corresponding
   location.
   The chafe guard 40 can be placed on a user's leg in the conventional manner
30 as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, to assist in minimising chafing between the
   user's legs.
    However, instead of the whole of the chafe guard 40 being placed so as to be
   fully taut on the user's leg as in the prior art bandelettes 10 as shown in Figure

                                             10
   1 and 2, the lower extension portion 50 can be scrunched so as to have slack,
   forming pleats 58 as shown in Figure 5.
   Then, when the user adopts the bent over position, causing the skin to stretch
 5 as described above, instead of the bands 22.1, 24.1 riding over the user's skin,
   the stretching of the skin is accommodated by the pleats 58 which are
   configured to expand by some of their slack being taken up.
   In addition, the presence of the lower extension portion 50 allows the lower
10 band 24.1 to be located at a lower position on the user's leg 12 than the lower
   band 24 of the prior art bandelette 10. This may allow the lower band 24.1 of
   the chafe guard 40 to be at a lower position on the user's leg 12 which is less
   susceptible to the detrimental effects caused by the deflecting and deforming
   of the user's leg when the user bends over and straightens up.
15
   When the user once again adopts an upright position, the slack can return so
   that the lower extension portion 50 can take its previous, fully pleated form.
   In this way, the repeated riding of the bands 22.1, 24.1 over the user's legs that
20 is likely to occur during use with the prior art bandelette 10 can be minimised or
   avoided with the chafe guard 40 of the present invention, thus minimising or
   reducing discomfort to the user, as well as chafing and pulling of hairs on the
   user's leg.
25 The upper extension portion 54 may be scrunched (not shown) in a similar
   manner as the lower extension portion 50. Because of the reversed orientation
   of the upper extension portion 54 relative to the lower extension portion 50,
   similar effects in accommodating stretching of the user's skin may be achieved
   on the other side of the user's leg, such as the front of the leg.
30
   Also, the presence of the upper extension portion 54 allows the upper band
   22.1 to be located at a higher position on the user's leg 12 than the upper band
   22 of the prior art bandelette 10. This may allow the upper band 22.1 of the
   chafe guard 40 to be at a higher position on the user's leg 12 which is less

                                           11
   susceptible to the detrimental effects caused by the deflecting and deforming
   of the user's leg 12 when the user bends over and straightens up.
   Another potential benefit of the lower and upper extension portions 50, 54 is
 5 that they can be stretched out to some extent, taking up some of the slack in
   these portions, to effectively lengthen the chafe guard 40 should it be found to
   be too short for a particular user. A potential disadvantage of relying on this
   feature is that the amount of slack available for use in relation to
   accommodating stretching of the user's skin as described above is reduced.
10
   In another embodiment, the chafe guard 40 may be provided with only the lower
   extension portion 50 with the upper extension portion 54 omitted, while in yet
   another embodiment, the opposite may apply, with only the upper extension
   portion and not the lower extension portion being provided.
15
   While the chafe guard 40 is described above as being a thigh guard for use on
   the user's leg, in other embodiments, the chafe guard 40 may be adapted for
   use on other parts of a user's body, such as other parts of the leg, the torso, or
   arm.
20
   While the deformation of the user's leg is described above in relation to the rear
   12.1 of the user's leg 12 and the skin at that location, it is to be understood that
   such deformation may occur at other locations such as the inner side of the leg
   (not shown), or outer or front sides 12.2 and 12.3, respectively.
25
   The chafe guard 40 also includes a guard formation 60 for minimising or limiting
   contact between the user's skin and the upper band 22.1. While the guard
   formation 60 is shown in Figures 3 and 5 as being located at the rear of the
   chafe guard (corresponding to the rear 12.1 of the leg 12) it extends to the side
30 of the chafe guard corresponding to the inside (not shown) of the leg.
   The guard formation 60 serves as a flap which is adapted to fold down (in a
   manner not shown), over the upper band 22.1. In this position of the guard
   formation 60, it is adapted to be located between the upper band 22.1 and the

                                             12
   user's opposite leg so as to serve as a protective flap. More specifically, in this
   position of the guard formation 60, it can serve as a barrier to minimise rubbing
   and interference between the upper band 22.1 and the user's opposite leg or
   chafe guard 40 on the user's opposite leg. In the absence of the guard formation
 5 60, if such rubbing and interference were allowed to occur, this would be likely
   to cause the upper band 22.1 to become deformed, to lose its upright integrity,
   or to crack, fold, crumble or bunch or roll up. This could exacerbate chafing
   between the user's legs.
10 Although the invention is described with reference to specific embodiments
   above, it may be embodied in many other forms, limited only by the scope of
   the claims.
   For example, the chafe guard 40 may serve a dual purpose - that is, a purpose
15 in addition to serving as a chafe guard - such as a sleeve for performing another
   function such as providing compression, warmth and forms of protection other
   than against chafing, for relieving muscle tension and irritation, for reducing
   risks of muscle strain or hernias, or for reducing risks of other damage to various
   body parts and tissue, such as muscles, bones, tendons, joints, skin, and so
20 on. Such sleeves are often referred to as compression sleeves, running
   sleeves, thigh sleeves, arm sleeves, sports sleeves and warming sleeves.
