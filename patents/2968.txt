25        The cannabinoid receptors are a class of cell membrane receptors belonging to the G
   protein-coupled receptor superfamily. There are currently two known subtypes, termed
   Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CB1) and Cannabinoid Receptor 2 (CB2). The CB1 receptor is
   mainly expressed in the central nervous (i.e. amygdala cerebellum, hippocampus) system
   and to a lesser amount in the periphery. CB2, which is encoded by the CNR2 gene, is
30 mostly expressed peripherally, on cells of the immune system, such as macrophages and T
   cells (Ashton, J. C. et al. Curr Neuropharmacol 2007, 5(2), 73-80; Miller, A. M. et al. Br J
   Pharmacol 2008, 153(2), 299-308; Centonze, D., et al. Curr Pharm Des 2008, 14(23),
   2370-42), and in the gastrointestinal system (Wright, K. L. et al. Br J Pharmacol 2008,
   153(2), 263-70). The CB2 receptor is also widely distributed in the brain where it is found

                                               3
   primarily on microglia and not neurons (Cabral, G. A. et al. Br J Pharmacol 2008, 153(2):
   240-51).
          The interest in CB2 receptor agonists has been steadily on the rise during the last
   decade (currently 30-40 patent applications/year) due to the fact that several of the early
 5 compounds have been shown to have beneficial effects in pre-clinical models for a number
   of human diseases including chronic pain (Beltramo, M. Mini Rev Med Chem 2009, 9(1),
    11-25), atherosclerosis (Mach, F. et al. J Neuroendocrinol 2008, 20 Suppl 1, 53-7),
   regulation of bone mass (Bab, I. et al. Br J Pharmacol 2008, 153(2), 182-8),
   neuroinflammation (Cabral, G. A. et al. J Leukoc Biol 2005, 78(6), 1192-7),
10 ischemia/reperfusion injury (Pacher, P. et al. Br J Pharmacol 2008, 153(2), 252-62),
   systemic fibrosis (Akhmetshina, A. et al. Arthritis Rheum 2009, 60(4), 1129-36; Garcia
   Gonzalez, E. et al. Rheumatology (Oxford) 2009, 48(9), 1050-6), liver fibrosis (Julien, B.
   et al. Gastroenterology 2005, 128(3), 742-55; Munoz-Luque, J. et al. J Pharmacol Exp
   Ther 2008, 324(2), 475-83).
15        Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the principal cause of tissue damage occurring in
   conditions such as stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiopulmonary bypass and other
   vascular surgeries, and organ transplantation, as well as a major mechanism of end-organ
   damage complicating the course of circulatory shock of various etiologies. All these
   conditions are characterized by a disruption of normal blood supply resulting in an
20 insufficient tissue oxygenation. Re-oxygenation e.g., reperfusion is the ultimate treatment
   to restore normal tissue oxygenation. However the absence of oxygen and nutrients from
   blood creates a condition in which the restoration of circulation results in further tissue
   damage. The damage of reperfusion injury is due in part to the inflammatory response of
   damaged tissues. White blood cells, carried to the area by the newly returning blood,
25 release a host of inflammatory factors such as interleukins as well as free radicals in
   response to tissue damage. The restored blood flow reintroduces oxygen within cells that
   damages cellular proteins, DNA, and the plasma membrane.
          Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) represents a strategy for harnessing the
   body's endogenous protective capabilities against the injury incurred by ischemia and
30 reperfusion. It describes the intriguing phenomenon in which transient non-lethal ischemia
   and reperfusion of one organ or tissue confers resistance to a subsequent episode of
   "lethal" ischemia reperfusion injury in a remote organ or tissue. The actual mechanism
   through which transient ischemia and reperfusion of an organ or tissue confers protection
   is currently unknown although several hypotheses have been proposed.
35        The humoral hypothesis proposes that the endogenous substance (such as adenosine,
   bradykinin, opioids, CGRP, endocannabinoids, Angiotensin I or some other as yet

                                               4
   unidentified humoral factor) generated in the remote organ or tissue enters the blood
   stream and activates its respective receptor in the target tissue and thereby recruiting the
   various intracellular pathways of cardioprotection implicated in ischemic preconditioning.
          Recent data indicates that endocannabinnoids and their receptors, in particular CB2
 5 might be involved in pre-conditioning and contribute to prevent reperfusion injury by
   downregulation of the inflammatory response (Pacher, P. et al. Br J Pharmacol 2008,
    153(2), 252-62). Specifically, recent studies using CB2 tool agonists demonstrated the
   efficacy of this concept for reducing the I/R injury in the heart (Defer, N. et al. Faseb J
   2009, 23(7), 2120-30), the brain (Zhang, M. et al. J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 2007, 27(7),
10  1387-96), the liver (Batkai, S. et al. Faseb J 2007, 21(8), 1788-800) and the kidney (Feizi,
   A. et al. Exp Toxicol Pathol 2008, 60(4-5), 405-10).
          Moreover, over the last few years, a growing body of literature indicates that CB2
   can also be of interest in sub-chronic and chronic setting. Specific upregulation of CB 1 and
   CB2 has been shown to be associated in animal models of chronic diseases associated with
15 fibrosis (Garcia-Gonzalez, E. et al. Rheumatology (Oxford) 2009, 48(9), 1050-6; Yang, Y.
   Y. et al. Liver Int 2009, 29(5), 678-85) with a relevant expression of CB2 in
   myofibroblasts, the cells responsible for fibrosis progression.
          Activation of CB2 receptor by selective CB2 agonist has in fact been shown to exert
   anti-fibrotic effect in diffuse systemic sclerosis (Garcia-Gonzalez, E. et al. Rheumatology
20 (Oxford) 2009, 48(9), 1050-6) and CB2 receptor has emerged as a critical target in
   experimental dermal fibrosis (Akhmetshina, A. et al. Arthritis Rheum 2009, 60(4), 1129
   36) and in in liver pathophysiology, including fibrogenesis associated with chronic liver
   diseases (Lotersztajn, S. et al. Gastroenterol Clin Biol 2007, 31(3), 255-8; Mallat, A. et al.
   Expert Opin Ther Targets 2007, 11(3), 403-9; Lotersztajn, S. et al. Br J Pharmacol 2008,
25  153(2), 286-9).

          Compound AB can be prepared from AA by oxidation with a suitable oxidizing
   reagent under conditions known to a person skilled in the art (step a), e.g. by treatment
 5 with 3-chloro perbenzoic acid in dichloromethane at ambient temperature.
          Conversion of compound AB to 6-chloro or 6-bromo-picoline AC (X = Cl, Br) can
   be achieved e.g. by treatment with phosphoryl trichloride or tribromide either without an
   additional solvent or in a suitable solvent such as chloroform at temperatures between 20
   'C and the boiling point of the solvent, or by using other conditions known in the literature
10 (step b).
          6-Chloro- or bromo-picoline AC (X = Cl, Br) can be transformed to compound AE
   by reaction with a suitably substituted primary or secondary alcohol AD in the presence of
   a base, for example sodium hydride, with or without an inert solvent, for example
   dimethylformamide, at temperatures ranging from room temperature to the reflux
15 temperature of the solvent, particularly at room temperature (step c).
          Compound AE can be further elaborated to compounds II by saponification (for
   compounds AE with R'        H) by methods well known to the ones skilled in the art - using
   e.g. aqueous LiOH, NaOH or KOH in tetrahydrofuran /ethanol or another suitable solvent
   at temperatures between 0 'C and the reflux temperature of the solvent employed.

                                              21
          If one of the starting materials, compounds of formulae AA, AD or III, contains one
   or more functional groups which are not stable or are reactive under the reaction conditions
   of one or more reaction steps, appropriate protecting groups (P) (as described e.g. in T.W.
   Greene et al., Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley and Sons Inc. New
 5 York 1999,   3 rd edition) can be introduced before the critical step applying methods well
   known in the art. Such protecting groups can be removed at a later stage of the synthesis
   using standard methods known in the art.
          If one or more compounds of formulae AA to AE, AC, II or III contain chiral
   centers, picolines of formula I can be obtained as mixtures of diastereomers or
10 enantiomers, which can be separated by methods well known in the art, e.g. (chiral) HPLC
   or crystallization. Racemic compounds can e.g. be separated into their antipodes via
   diastereomeric salts by crystallization or by separation of the antipodes by specific
   chromatographic methods using either a chiral adsorbent or a chiral eluent.

          Compound AC can be prepared from BA by coupling a suitably substituted
   cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl metal species of formula BB (M is e.g. a trifluoroborate [BF 3]
 5 K', a boronic acid B(OH) 2 or a boronic acid pinacol ester) (step a), e.g. an
   organotrifluoroborate potassium salt in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as
   palladium(II)acetate / butyl-1-adamantylphosphine and a base such as cesium carbonate in
   an inert solvent such as toluene at temperatures between 50 'C and the boiling temperature
   of the solvent, or an arylboronic acid or arylboronic acid ester in the presence of a suitable
10 catalyst, in particular a palladium catalyst and more particularly palladium(II)acetate /
   triphenylphosphine mixtures or palladium(II)chloride-dppf (1,1'
   bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) complexes and a base such as triethylamine, sodium
   carbonate or potassium phosphate in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide, toluene,
   tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile or dimethoxyethane. Optionally, compound BB can also be an
15 amine which is coupled to BA by methods well known to a person skilled in the art, e.g.
   using a palladium catalyst such as tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium /
   dimethylbisdiphenyl-phosphinoxanthene and a base such as cesium carbonate in a solvent

                                              23
   such as 1,4-dioxane, preferentially at the boiling point of the solvent. Optionally, alkenyl
   containing R 2 residues can be transformed to the corresponding alkyl congeners AC using
   conditions described in the literature such as e.g. a hydrogenation reaction using hydrogen
   gas in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium on carbon in a solvent such as ethanol or
 5 ethyl acetate particularly at ambient temperature.
          Compound AC can be further elaborated to compound I by: i) reaction with
   compound AD to form compound AE as described in step c of scheme 1; ii) saponification
   as described in step d of scheme 1; and iii) amide bond formation as described in step e of
   scheme 1.
10        Furthermore, compound BA can be converted into compound BC by treatment with
   compound AD as described in step c of scheme 1 (step b).
          Subsequent transformation of compound BC into compound AE can be achieved as
   discussed for the conversion of BA into AC (step a).
          Compound AE can be further elaborated to compound I by: i) saponification as
15 described in step d of scheme 1; ii) amide bond formation as described in step e of scheme
    1.
          Alternatively, compound BC (R' = methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tert. butyl or another
   suitable protecting group described for example in T.W. Greene et al., Protective Groups
   in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley and Sons Inc. New York 1999, 3 rd edition) can be: i)
20 converted into its acid congener BC (R' = H) as described in step d of scheme 1; ii)
   transformed into the corresponding amide BD by treatment with amine III as described in
   step e of scheme 1; and iii) reacted with BB as described in step a to arrive at compound I.
          In addition, compounds of formula I with R 1 being an alkylsulfonyl residue can be
   synthesized using the following reaction sequence: i) Reaction of compound BA (e.g. for
25 R' = H: 5-bromo-6-chloro-pyridine-2-carboxylic acid; CAN 959958-25-9) with a thiol AD
   to yield thioether BC, e.g. in the presence of a base such as cesium carbonate in a solvent
   such as DMSO, preferentially at temperatures between 100 and 150 'C; ii) conversion of
   thioethers BC (R1 = S-Alkyl) to its corresponding sulfonyl congeners BC (R1 = S(O)
   Alkyl), e.g. by using an oxidizing reagent such as 3-chlorobenzoperoxoic acid in a solvent
30 such as dichloromethane, preferentially at ambient temperature; iii) transformation of
   sulfonyl derivatives BC into compound AE as discussed for the conversion of BA into AC
   (step a); and iv) further elaboration to sulfonyl derivative I via saponification as described
   in step d of scheme 1 followed by an amide bond formation as described in step e of
   scheme 1. Optionally, the row order of the reaction sequence can be interchanged.
35 Compounds of formula I with R 1 being an alkylsulfinyl residue can be synthesized in

                                                24
   analogy to their alkylsulfonyl congeners but omitting the conversion of thioethers BC (RI
     S-Alkyl) to the corresponding sulfonyl congeners BC (R1 = S(O)-Alkyl).
          Furthermore, compound I can also be synthesized applying the following reaction
   sequence: i) saponification of compound BA (R' = methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tert. butyl or
 5 another suitable protecting group described for example in T.W. Greene et al., Protective
   Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley and Sons Inc. New York 1999,             3 rd edition) to its
   acid congener BC (R' = H) as described in step d of scheme 1; ii) conversion to the
   corresponding amide by treatment with amine III as described in step e of scheme 1; iii)
   reaction with compound BB as described in step a; and iv) reaction with compound AD as
10 described in step b. Optionally step iii) and step iv) can be interchanged.
          If one of the starting materials, compounds of formulae BA, BB, AD or III contains
   one or more functional groups which are not stable or are reactive under the reaction
   conditions of one or more reaction steps, appropriate protecting groups (P) (as described
   e.g. in T.W. Greene et al., Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley and Sons
15 Inc. New York 1999,     3 rd edition) can be introduced before the critical step applying
   methods well known in the art. Such protecting groups can be removed at a later stage of
   the synthesis using standard methods known in the art.
          If one or more compounds of formulae BA, BB or AD contain chiral centers,
   picolines of formula AC and AE can be obtained as mixtures of diastereomers or
20 enantiomers, which can be separated by methods well known in the art, e.g. (chiral) HPLC
   or crystallization. Racemic compounds can e.g. be separated into their antipodes via
   diastereomeric salts by crystallization or by separation of the antipodes by specific
   chromatographic methods using either a chiral adsorbent or a chiral eluent.
          Following the procedure according to scheme 3, compound BC (R' = H, methyl,
25 ethyl, isopropyl, tert. butyl or another suitable protecting group described for example in
   T.W. Greene et al., Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley and Sons Inc.
   New York 1999, 3 d edition) can be used as starting material. BC is either commercially
   available, described in the literature, can be synthesized by methods described in scheme 3
   or by other methods known to a person skilled in the art.

10 toluene at temperatures between 50 'C and the boiling temperature of the solvent, or an
   arylboronic acid or arylboronic acid ester in the presence of a suitable catalyst, in particular
   a palladium catalyst and more particularly palladium(ll)acetate / triphenylphosphine
   mixtures or palladium(ll)chloride-dppf (1,1 '-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) complexes
   and a base such as triethylamine, sodium carbonate or potassium phosphate in an inert
15 solvent such as dimethylformamide, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile and
   dimethoxyethane. Optionally, alkenyl containing R 2 residues can be transformed to the
   corresponding alkyl congeners AA using conditions described in the literature such as e.g.
   a hydrogenation reaction using hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst such as
   palladium on carbon in a solvent such as ethanol or ethyl acetate particularly at ambient
20 temperature.
          Compound AB can be prepared from AA by oxidation with a suitable oxidizing
   reagent as described in step a of scheme 1 (step b).
          Conversion of compound AB to 6-chloro- or 6-bromo-picoline AC (X = Cl, Br) can
   be achieved as described in step b of scheme 1 (step c).

          Compound AE can be prepared from AC by coupling a suitably substituted
   cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl metal species of formula DB (M is e.g. a trifluoroborate [BF 3 ]
   K*, a boronic acid B(OH) 2 or a boronic acid pinacol ester) (step d), e.g. an
   organotrifluoroborate potassium salt in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as
 5 palladium(ll)acetate / butyl-1-adamantylphosphine and a base such as cesium carbonate in
   an inert solvent such as toluene at temperatures between 50 'C and the boiling temperature
   of the solvent, or an arylboronic acid or arylboronic acid ester in the presence of a suitable
   catalyst, in particular a palladium catalyst and more particularly palladium(ll)acetate /
   triphenylphosphine mixtures or palladium(ll)chloride-dppf (1,1'
10 bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) complexes and a base such as triethylamine, sodium
   carbonate or potassium phosphate in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide, toluene,

   residues can be transformed to the corresponding alkyl congeners AE using conditions
   described in the literature such as e.g. a hydrogenation reaction using hydrogen gas in the
15 presence of a catalyst such as palladium on carbon in a solvent such as ethanol or ethyl
   acetate particularly at ambient temperature.
          Compound AE can be further elaborated to compound I by: i) saponification as
   described in step d of scheme 1 (step e); ii) amide bond formation as described in step e of
   scheme 1 (step f).
20        If one of the starting materials, compounds of formulae DA, BB, DB or III, contains
   one or more functional groups which are not stable or are reactive under the reaction
   conditions of one or more reaction steps, appropriate protecting groups (P) (as described
   e.g. in T.W. Greene et al., Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley and Sons
   Inc. New York 1999, 3 rd edition) can be introduced before the critical step applying
25 methods well known in the art. Such protecting groups can be removed at a later stage of
   the synthesis using standard methods known in the art.
          If one or more compounds of formulae DA, BB, AA, AB, AC, DB, AE, II or III
   contain chiral centers, picolines of formula I can be obtained as mixtures of diastereomers
   or enantiomers, which can be separated by methods well known in the art, e.g. (chiral)
30 HPLC or crystallization. Racemic compounds can e.g. be separated into their antipodes via
   diastereomeric salts by crystallization or by separation of the antipodes by specific
   chromatographic methods using either a chiral adsorbent or a chiral eluent.
          Following the procedure according to scheme 6, compound EA can be used as
   starting material. EA is either commercially available, described in the literature or can be
35 synthesized by a person skilled in the art.

         Compound EB can be prepared from EA by oxidation with a suitable oxidizing
   reagent under conditions known to a person skilled in the art (step a), e.g. by treatment
 5 with 3-chloro perbenzoic acid in dichloromethane at ambient temperature.
         Conversion of compound EB to 6-chloro or 6-bromo compound EC (X =Cl, Br) can
   be achieved e.g. by treatment with phosphoryl trichloride or tribromide either without an
   additional solvent or in a suitable solvent such as chloroform at temperatures between 20
    0C and the boiling point of the solvent or by using other conditions known in the literature
10 (step b).
         Hydrolysis of compound EC leads to picoline ED and can be performed under acidic
   or basic conditions known to a person skilled in the art, e.g. by treatment with an aqueous
   solution of sodium hydroxide at 100 0 C (step c).
         Compound II can be prepared from ED by coupling a suitably substituted cycloalkyl
15 or cycloalkenyl metal species of formula DB (M is e.g. a trifluoroborate [BF 3 ]-K*, a
   boronic acid B(OH) 2 or a boronic acid pinacol ester) (step d) as described in step d of
   scheme 6. Optionally, alkenyl containing R1 residues can be transformed to the
   corresponding alkyl congeners II using conditions described in the literature such as e.g. a
   hydrogenation reaction using hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium
20 on carbon in a solvent such as ethanol or ethyl acetate particularly at ambient temperature.
   In cases where the acid group of compound ED is not compatible with the conditions
   applied to introduce the R1 residue, suitable protecting groups such as ester protecting
   groups e.g. a methyl ester can be introduced prior to step d and removed at a later point of
   the synthesis. Protecting group introduction and removal can be carried out by suitable

                                               29
   methods known in the art (for more details see T.W. Greene et al., Protective Groups in
   Organic Chemistry, John Wiley and Sons Inc. New York 1999, 3 rd edition).
          Further conversion of compound II to compound I can be done by applying amide
   bond formation conditions as depicted in step e of scheme 1 (step e).
 5        If one of the starting materials, compounds of formulae EA, DB or III, contains one
   or more functional groups which are not stable or are reactive under the reaction conditions
   of one or more reaction steps, appropriate protecting groups (P) (as described e.g. in T.W.
   Greene et al., Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley and Sons Inc. New
   York 1999,    3 rd edition) can be introduced before the critical step applying methods well
10 known in the art. Such protecting groups can be removed at a later stage of the synthesis
   using standard methods known in the art.
          If one or more compounds of formulae EA to ED, DB, II or III contain chiral
   centers, picolines of formula I can be obtained as mixtures of diastereomers or
   enantiomers, which can be separated by methods well known in the art, e.g. (chiral) HPLC

          The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of formula (I), comprising
   the reaction of a compound of formula (A)

          wherein R to R3 are as defined in any one of claims I to 10.
          If desired, the compound of formula (I) can be converted into a pharmaceutically
   acceptable salt thereof.
25        Compounds of formula R -NH 2 or (A) may contain functional groups that would
   interfere with the coupling procedures described for the amide coupling step (A) to ( I). In
   this case it is understood that R -NH 2 or (A) need to be suitably protected by methods
   known in the art before conducting the amide coupling procedure and compounds need to

                                                30
   be deprotected after the coupling step by methods known in the art to deliver compounds
   of formula (I).
          Amide coupling agents for the reaction of compounds of formula (A) with amines of
   formula R 3 -NH 2 are for example NN'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), NN'
 5 dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide
   hydrochloride (EDCI), 1-[bis(dimethylamino)-methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5
   b]pyridinium-3-oxide hexafluorophosphate (HATU), 1-hydroxy-1,2,3-benzotriazole
   (HOBT), 0-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), or
   O-benzotriazole-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-uronium-hexafluoro-phosphate            (HBTU). Particular
10 coupling agents are TBTU and HATU. Suitable bases include triethylamine, N
   methylmorpholine and particularly diisopropylethylamine. Alternative methods known in
   the art may commence by preparing the acid chloride from (A) and coupling with an amine
   of formula R 3 -NH 2 in the presence of a suitable base.

20 sclerosis, stroke, transient ischemic attack or uveitis, which method comprises
   administering an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) to a patient in need

          The invention particularly relates to a compound of formula (I) for the treatment or
   prophylaxis of ischemia, reperfusion injury, liver fibrosis or kidney fibrosis, in particular
25 ischemia or reperfusion injury.
          The invention further particularly relates to a compound of formula (I) for the

30        Another embodiment of the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition or
   medicament containing a compound of the invention and a therapeutically inert carrier,
   diluent or excipient, as well as a method of using the compounds of the invention to
   prepare such composition and medicament. In one example, the compound of formula (I)
   may be formulated by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at the
35 desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-

                                               32
   toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed into a galenical
   administration form. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and
   the concentration of compound, but preferably ranges anywhere from about 3 to about 8. In
   one example, a compound of formula (I) is formulated in an acetate buffer, at pH 5. In
 5 another embodiment, the compound of formula (I) is sterile. The compound may be stored,
   for example, as a solid or amorphous composition, as a lyophilized formulation or as an
   aqueous solution.
          Compositions are formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with
   good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular
10 disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the
   individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of
   administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical
   practitioners.
          The compounds of the invention may be administered by any suitable means,
15 including oral, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal, transdermal,
   parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, intradermal, intrathecal and
   epidural and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration.
   Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or
   subcutaneous administration. The compounds of the invention may be administered in
20 particular by intravitreal administration.
          The compounds of the present invention may be administered in any convenient
   administrative form, e.g., tablets, powders, capsules, solutions, dispersions, suspensions,
   syrups, sprays, suppositories, gels, emulsions, patches, etc. Such compositions may contain
   components conventional in pharmaceutical preparations, e.g., diluents, carriers, pH
25 modifiers, sweeteners, bulking agents, and further active agents.
          A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention
   and a carrier or excipient. Suitable carriers and excipients are well known to those skilled
   in the art and are described in detail in, e.g., Ansel, Howard C., et al., Ansel's
   Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems. Philadelphia: Lippincott,

   surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents,
35 preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants,
   sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents, diluents and other known additives to

10 Pharmacological tests
   The following tests were carried out in order to determine the activity of the compounds of
   formula I:
   Radioligand binding assay
   The affinity of the compounds of the invention for cannabinoid CB 1 receptors was
15 determined using recommended amounts of membrane preparations (PerkinElmer) of
   human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing the human CNR1 or CNR2 receptors in
   conjunction with 1.5 or 2.6 nM [3H]-CP-55,940 (Perkin Elmer) as radioligand,
   respectively. Binding was performed in binding buffer (50 mM Tris, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2.5
   mM EDTA, and 0.5% (wt/vol) fatty acid free BSA, pH 7.4 for CB1 receptor and 50 mM
20 Tris, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2.5 mM EGTA, and 0.1% (wt/vol) fatty acid free BSA, pH 7.4 for CB2
   receptor) in a total volume of 0.2 ml for lh at 30 'C shaking. The reaction was terminated
   by rapid filtration through microfiltration plates coated with 0.5% polyethylenimine
   (UniFilter GF/B filter plate; Packard). Bound radioactivity was analyzed for Ki using
   nonlinear regression analysis (Activity Base, ID Business Solution, Limited), with the Kd
25 values for [3H]CP55,940 determined from saturation experiments. The compounds of
   formula (I) show an excellent affinity for the CB2 receptor with affinities below 10 PM,
   more particularly of 1 nM to 3 pM and most particularly of 1 nM to 100 nM.
   cAMP Assay
   CHO cells expressing human CB 1 or CB2 receptors are seeded 17-24 hours prior to the
30 experiment 50.000 cells per well in a black 96 well plate with flat clear bottom (Corning
   Costar #3904) in DMEM (Invitrogen No. 31331), 1x HT supplement, with 10 % fetal calf
   serum and incubated at 5% CO 2 and 37 'C in a humidified incubator. The growth medium
   was exchanged with Krebs Ringer Bicarbonate buffer with 1 mM IBMX and incubated at

                                           114
   30 'C for 30 min. Compounds were added to a final assay volume of 100 PI and incubated
   for 30 min at 30 'C. Using the cAMP-Nano-TRF detection kit the assay (Roche
   Diagnostics) was stopped by the addition of 50 l lysis reagent (Tris, NaCl, 1.5% Triton
   X100, 2.5% NP40, 10% NaN 3) and 50 l detection solutions (20 pM mAb Alexa700
 5 cAMP 1:1, and 48 pM Ruthenium-2-AHA-cAMP) and shaken for 2h at room temperature.
   The time-resolved energy transfer is measured by a TRF reader (Evotec Technologies
   GmbH), equipped with a ND:YAG laser as excitation source. The plate is measured twice
   with the excitation at 355 nm and at the emission with a delay of 100 ns and a gate of 100
   ns, total exposure time 10s at 730 (bandwidth30 nm) or 645 nm (bandwidth 75 nm),
10 respectively. The FRET signal is calculated as follows: FRET = T730-Alexa730-P(T645
   B645) with P = Ru730-B730/Ru645-B645, where T730 is the test well measured at
   730 nM, T645 is the test well measured at 645 nm, B730 and B645 are the buffer controls
   at 730 nm and 645 nm, respectively. cAMP content is determined from the function of a
   standard curve spanning from 10 p M to 0.13 nM cAMP.
15 EC50 values were determined using Activity Base analysis (ID Business Solution, Limited).
   The EC50 values for a wide range of cannabinoid agonists generated from this assay were
   in agreement with the values published in the scientific literature.
   The compounds of the invention are CB2 receptor agonists with EC50 below 1 PM and
   selectivity versus CB1 in the corresponding assay of at least 10 fold. Particular compound
20 of the invention are CB2 receptor agonists with EC50 below 0.05 PM and selectivity versus
   CB1 in the corresponding assay of at least 500 fold.
   For example, the following compounds showed the following human EC50 values in the
   functional cAMP assay described above:
