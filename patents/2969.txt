                                         BACKGROUND
         Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are hematopoietic stem cell malignancies with a
rising prevalence owing to the aging of the American population. MDS comprise a group of
malignant hematologic disorders associated with impaired erythropoiesis, dysregulated myeloid
differentiation and increased risk for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation. The
incidence of MDS is increasing with 15,000 to 20,000 new cases each year in the United States
and large numbers of patients requiring chronic blood transfusions. Ineffective erythropoiesis
remains the principal therapeutic challenge for patients with more indolent subtypes, driven by a
complex interplay between genetic abnormalities intrinsic to the MDS clone and senescence
dependent inflammatory signals within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Although
three agents are approved for the treatment of MDS in the United States (US), lenalidomide
(LEN) represents the only targeted therapeutic. Treatment with LEN yields sustained red blood
cell transfusion independence accompanied by partial or complete resolution of cytogenetic
abnormalities in the majority of patients with a chromosome 5q deletion (del5q), whereas only a
minority of patients with non-del5q MDS achieve a meaningful response, infrequently
accompanied by cytogenetic improvement. Although responses in patients with del5q MDS are

                                            SUMMARY
         It is shown herein that CD33 myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) specifically
accumulate in the BM of MDS patients and impair hematopoiesis through a mechanism that
involves S100A9 as an endogenous ligand for CD33 initiated signaling. Therefore, disclosed are
compositions and methods for treating MDS that generally involve administering an effective
amount of a CD33/S100A9 antagonist to inhibit activation of MDSCs. For example, the method
can involve administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a composition
comprising an agent that binds and sequesters S100A9.
         In some embodiments, the CD33/S100A9 antagonist binds and sequesters endogenous
S100A9 and inhibits its binding to CD33 receptor on MDSCs. Therefore, in some embodiments,
the CD33/S100A9 antagonist is a molecule containing a S100A9-binding domain. For example,
the CD33/S 100A9 antagonist can be a chimeric fusion protein comprising the ectodomain of
CD33, Toll like Receptor 4 (TLR4), Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE), or
a combination thereof. This ectodomain of CD33, TLR4, and/or RAGE can be any fragment of
CD33, TLR4, and/or RAGE capable of binding S100A9. For example, in some cases the CD33
ectodomain contains only the variable region of CD33.
         Therefore, disclosed is a recombinant fusion protein comprising an immunoglobulin Fc
region; and one, two, three, or more of an extracellular domain of human CD33, extracellular
domain of TLR4, extracellular domain of RAGE, or a combination thereof that binds S100A9
protein and is linked by a peptide bond or a peptide linker sequence to the carboxy-terminus of
the immunoglobulin Fc region. The fusion protein can further contain a biotin acceptor peptide
that can be biotinylated with biotin ligase (BirA) in the presence of biotin and ATP.
         In some embodiments, the fusion protein comprises a formula selected from the group
consisting of:
                                        eCD33 - eTLR4 - Fc,

        wherein "eTLR4" is the extracellular domain of TLR4,
        wherein "eRAGE" is the extracellular domain of RAGE,
        wherein "Fe" is the immunoglobulin Fc region,
        wherein "Avi" is an optional biotin acceptor peptide that can be biotinylated with biotin
ligase (BirA) in the presence of biotin and ATP, and
        wherein "-" is a peptide linker or a peptide bond.

    WO 2015/003149                                                          PCT/US2014/045444
         The Si 00A9 protein can be present as a monomer or dimer. For example, the Si 00A9
protein can be in association with S1 00A8 protein as heterodimer. In these cases, the
CD33/S100A9 antagonist binds and sequesters the S100A8/A9 heterodimer complex.
         In some cases, the CD33/S100A9 antagonist is multivalent, e.g., it contains at least 2, 3,
or more S100A9-binding domains. For example, the CD33/S100A9 antagonist can be a chimeric
fusion protein comprising a combination of one or more CD33 ectodomains, one or more TLR4
ectodomains, and/or one or more RAGE ectodomains. The fusion protein can further comprise
an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (Fc), e.g., from IgG4, IgG2 or IgG1.
         Multiple copies of the fusion protein can also be combined to form a multivalent
complex. Therefore, in some embodiments, two, three, four, five, or more fusion proteins can be
linked to a core molecule or particle. For example, the Fc portion can be biotinylated. The
biotinylated fusion protein can then be conjugated to a multimeric (e.g., tetrameric) streptavidin.
In other embodiments, two or more fusion proteins are conjugated to the surface of a liposome or
other microparticle. The multivalent complex can be homogeneous, i.e., containing multiple
copies of one type of one fusion protein, or it can be heterogeneous. For example, the
multivalent complex can contain combinations of CD33, TLR4, and RAGE fusion proteins. In
addition, the multivalent complex can contain multivalent fusion proteins, i.e., at least two fusion
protein containing two or more S100A9-binding domains.
         In other embodiments, the CD33/S100A9 inhibitor binds and inhibits endogenous CD33
receptor on MDSCs. Therefore, in some embodiments, the CD33/S100A9 antagonist is a
molecule containing a CD33 binding domain. For example, the CD33/S100A9 inhibitor can be a
recombinant protein that binds CD33 without activating MDSCs and competes for binding of
endogenous S100A9. For example, the CD33/S100A9 inhibitor can be a mutant or truncated
variant of S100A9, i.e., dominant negative S100A9.
         In some embodiments, the CD33/S100A9 inhibitor is an antibody or aptamer that
specifically binds CD33 or S100A9 thereby inhibiting endogenous CD33/S100A9 activation.
         Also disclosed are methods for treating a disease or condition in a subject that is caused
or exacerbated by S1 00A9 activity, comprising administering to the subject a composition
comprising a CD33/S100A9 antagonist disclosed herein.
         Also disclosed are methods for identifying an agent for treating MDS. In some
embodiments, the methods involve screening candidate agents for the ability to prevent S1 00A9
binding to CD33. In other embodiments, the methods involve screening candidate agents for the
ability to prevent activation of CD33 by S100A9.

mice were transplanted with enriched HSC from either WT, Si 0OA9Tg or a 1:1 ratio of WT:Tg
male cells. The percent of engraftment was assessed by measuring the expression of the SRY
gene by qPCR normalized against un-transplanted male mice BM cells. GAPDH serves as the
internal control.
         Figure 9 is a model of CD33/Siglec 3-mediated signaling either through ITIM or ITAM
motifs. CD33 has two cytosolic ITIM motifs. Src kinases phosphorylate tyrosine residues
present in the ITIMS after CD33 cross-linking or upon interaction with its ligand(s).
Phosphorylated ITIMs recruit and activate phosphatases (SHPI, SHP2, or SHIP-1), resulting in
down regulation of MAPK and ultimately, cellular inhibition and the production of inhibitory
cytokines. Activation of CD33 also induces S1OOA8 and S1OOA9 expression, which are secreted
and act as heterodimers for CD33 or TLR4, and as such, mediates inflammation and MDSC
activation. Siglecs that lack ITIMs possess charged amino acids in their trans-membrane domain,
which allow association with DAP 12, an ITAM-bearing activating adaptor. As is the case with
ITIMs, Src kinases also phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the ITAM of DAP12. Syk kinase and
ZAP70 are then recruited and perpetuate downstream cellular activation, differentiation, and/or
maturation.
         Figure 10 shows t effect of active DAP 12 on immature DC maturation. Primary DCs
were prepared from healthy donors and infected with adenoviral vectors containing GFP alone,
WT-DAP12, dnDAP12 and active DAP12 (Ad-P23) as indicated. The cells were cultured for 72
hrs before flow cytometric analysis using mature DC surface marker as indicated. Mock infected
DC and Isotype IgG included in control group. Each experimental construct was compared to
the empty-vector control (filled histograms), and infected cells were gated on GFP prior to
analysis.

                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
         Immature myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), known to accumulate in tumor
bearing mice and cancer patients, are site-specific inflammatory and T cell immunosuppressive
effector cells that contribute to cancer progression (Gabrilovich, D.I., et al. 2009. Nat Rev
Immunol 9:162-174; Kusmartsev, S., et al. 2006. Cancer Immunol Immunother 55:237-245).
Their suppressive activity is in part driven by inflammation-associated signaling molecules, such
as the danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) heterodimer Si 00A8/S 1 00A9 (also known
as myeloid-related protein (MRP)-8 and MRP-14, respectively), through ligation of TLR4
(Ehrchen, J.M., et al. 2009. J Leukoc Biol 86:557-566; Vogl, T., et al. 2007. Nat Med 13:1042
 1049). Murine CD1 1b*Gr1K MDSCs form the basis of the vast majority of the mechanistic
studies, however, much less has been reported on their human counterparts. Human MDSCs lack
most markers of mature immune cells (LIN-, HLA-DR-) but possess CD33, the prototypical
member of Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like (Ig) super-family of lectins (Siglec)
(Gabrilovich, D.I., et al. 2009. Nat Rev Immunol 9:162-174; Talmadge, J.E. 2007. Clin Cancer
Res 13:5243-5248; Talmadge, J.E., et al. 2007. Cancer Metastasis Rev 26:373-400; Crocker,
P.R., et al. 2007. Nat Rev Immunol 7:255-266). Importantly, while its precise action is unknown,
CD33 possesses an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) that is associated
with immune suppression (Crocker, P.R., et al. 2007. Nat Rev Immunol 7:255-266).
         It is shown herein that LIN-HLA-DRCD33        MDSCs specifically accumulate in the BM
of MDS patients (herein referred to as MDS-MDSC) and impair hematopoiesis through a
mechanism that involves S100A9 as an endogenous ligand for CD33 initiated signaling.
Importantly, using S1 00A9 transgenic (S1 0OA9Tg) mice, it is shown that sustained activation of
this inflammatory pathway leads to the development of MDS, and that this hematologic
phenotype is rescued by strategies that suppress CD33 ITIM-signaling. The disclosed finding
that S100A9 ligates CD33 to induce MDSC expansion indicates that targeting this pathway can
provide a therapeutic approach for the treatment of MDS. Finally, the discovery of this signaling
pathway verifies the role of S1 00A9 as an important initiator of immune-suppression. S1 0OA9Tg
mice may therefore serve as a useful model for the study of MDS pathogenesis, treatment and
the overall role of MDSC in cancer.

    WO 2015/003149                                                          PCT/US2014/045444
        Therefore, disclosed are compositions and methods for treating MDS that involve the use
of a CD33/S100A9 inhibitor to inhibit activation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).
        CD33/S100A9 Inhibitor
        In some embodiments, the CD33/S100A9 inhibitor binds and sequesters endogenous
S100A9 and inhibits its binding to CD33 receptor on MDSCs. Therefore, in some embodiments,
the CD33/S100A9 antagonist is a molecule containing a S100A9 binding domain. In other
embodiments, the CD33/S100A9 inhibitor binds and inhibits endogenous CD33 receptor on
MDSCs. Therefore, in some embodiments, the CD33/S100A9 antagonist is a molecule
containing a CD33 binding domain.
        Soluble Receptors
        For example, the CD33/S100A9 inhibitor can be a soluble CD33 receptor. A "soluble
receptor" is a receptor polypeptide that is not bound to a cell membrane. Soluble receptors are
most commonly ligand-binding receptor polypeptides that lack transmembrane and cytoplasmic
domains. Soluble receptors can comprise additional amino acid residues, such as affinity tags
that provide for purification of the polypeptide or provide sites for attachment of the polypeptide
to a substrate, or immunoglobulin constant region sequences. Many cell-surface receptors have
naturally occurring, soluble counterparts that are produced by proteolysis. Soluble receptor
polypeptides are said to be substantially free of transmembrane and intracellular polypeptide
segments when they lack sufficient portions of these segments to provide membrane anchoring
or signal transduction, respectively.
        For example, the CD33/S100A9 antagonist can be a chimeric fusion protein comprising
the ectodomain of CD33, Toll like Receptor 4 (TLR4), Receptor for Advanced Glycation End
Products (RAGE), or a combination thereof. This ectodomain of CD33, TLR4, and/or RAGE
can be any fragment of CD33, TLR4, and/or RAGE capable of binding S100A9.
        Fusion proteins, also known as chimeric proteins, are proteins created through the joining
of two or more genes which originally coded for separate proteins. Translation of this fusion
gene results in a single polypeptide with function properties derived from each of the original
proteins. Recombinant fusion proteins can be created artificially by recombinant DNA
technology for use in biological research or therapeutics. Chimeric mutant proteins occur
naturally when a large-scale mutation, typically a chromosomal translocation, creates a novel
coding sequence containing parts of the coding sequences from two different genes.
        The functionality of fusion proteins is made possible by the fact that many protein
functional domains are modular. In other words, the linear portion of a polypeptide which
                                                  12

    WO 2015/003149                                                             PCT/US2014/045444
corresponds to a given domain, such as a tyrosine kinase domain, may be removed from the rest
of the protein without destroying its intrinsic enzymatic capability. Thus, any of the herein
disclosed functional domains can be used to design a fusion protein.
         A recombinant fusion protein is a protein created through genetic engineering of a fusion
gene. This typically involves removing the stop codon from a cDNA sequence coding for the
first protein, then appending the cDNA sequence of the second protein in frame through ligation
or overlap extension PCR. That DNA sequence will then be expressed by a cell as a single
protein. The protein can be engineered to include the full sequence of both original proteins, or
only a portion of either.
         If the two entities are proteins, often linker (or "spacer") peptides are also added which
make it more likely that the proteins fold independently and behave as expected. Especially in
the case where the linkers enable protein purification, linkers in protein or peptide fusions are
sometimes engineered with cleavage sites for proteases or chemical agents which enable the
liberation of the two separate proteins. This technique is often used for identification and
purification of proteins, by fusing a GST protein, FLAG peptide, or a hexa-his peptide (aka: a
6xhis-tag) which can be isolated using nickel or cobalt resins (affinity chromatography).
         Amino acid sequences for suitable CD33, TLR4, and RAGE ectodomains are known and
adaptable for use in the disclosed compositions and methods. For example, the ectodomain of
Homo sapiens Myeloid cell surface antigen CD33 (Uniprot P20138 [aa. 18-259] can have the
following amino acid sequence:

fragment or variant thereof, e.g., having an amino acid sequence having at least 650%, 70%, 710%,
72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%,

ID NO:1, wherein the fragment or variant is capable of binding S1 00A9.
         There are at least three known single nucleotide polymorphisms ("SNPs") in the
ectodomain of CD33 (i.e., W22R, R69G, S128N). Therefore, the extracellular domain of Homo
sapiens CD33 can have the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 with any one or more of these

         In some cases, the CD33 ectodomain contains only the variable region of CD33
("vCD33"). For example, in some embodiments, the vCD33 portion has the following amino

77%,78%, 79%,80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%,
93%,94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:3, wherein the
fragment or variant is capable of binding S100A9. The vCD33 can also have any one or more of
the disclosed SNPs (i.e., W22R, R69G, S128N). Therefore, in some embodiments, the vCD33
portion has the following amino acid sequence:

ERGSTKYX 3YK SPQLSVHVTD-135, where X1 is W or R; wherein X 2 is R or G; and wherein
X 3 is S or N (SEQ ID NO:4).
         The variable domain of CD33 can be further mutated to create more glycosylation sites in
order to enhance binding to S100A9. These mutations can be screened in silico and/or tested in
vitro to evaluate S1 00A9 binding.
         N-linked carbohydrates are linked through N-Acetylglucosamine and asparagines. The
N-linked consensus sequence is Asn-X1 - X 2 ,wherein X 1 is any amino acid other than Pro, and X 2
is Ser or Thr. Most O-linked carbohydrate covalent attachments involve a linkage between the
monosaccharide N- Acetylgalactosamine and the amino acids serine or threonine.
         Non-limiting examples of mutant sites will be but not limited at CD33 residues that can
be mutated to create more glycosylation sites include Q26N, P40N, L78T, and E84N. Other

residues can be identified and tested using routine methods. For example, protein-protein
reactions can be assayed using a binding affinity assay, such as an assay that uses surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) to detect unlabeled interactants in real time, e.g., using a BiacoreTM
Sensor Chip (GE Healtchare).

        The ectodomain of TLR4 has previously been used in a fusion protein with myeloid
differentiation factor 2 (MD-2) to function as a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) trap. MD-2 is
necessary for TLR4 to bind LPS. However, it is not necessary for TLR4 to bind and trap
S100A9. Therefore, in some embodiments, the fusion protein containing TLR4 does not also
contain MD-2. In other embodiments, the fusion protein contains both TLR4 and CD33
ectodomains.

        A receptor extracellular domain of CD33, TLR4, and/or RAGE can be expressed as a
fusion with immunoglobulin heavy chain constant regions, typically an Fc fragment, which
contains two constant region domains and lacks the variable region. Such fusions can be secreted
as multimeric molecules wherein the Fc portions are disulfide bonded to each other and two
receptor polypeptides are arrayed in close proximity to each other. This chimeric molecule can
be produced as fusion protein, which can be formed by the chemical coupling of the constituent
polypeptides or it can be expressed as a single polypeptide from nucleic acid sequence encoding
the single contiguous fusion protein. A single chain fusion protein is a fusion protein having a
single contiguous polypeptide backbone. Fusion proteins can be prepared using conventional
techniques in molecular biology to join the two genes in frame into a single nucleic acid, and
then expressing the nucleic acid in an appropriate host cell under conditions in which the fusion
protein is produced. In particular, the CD33/S100A9 inhibitor can be a chimeric fusion protein
comprising the ectodomain of CD33, TLR4, and/or RAGE and an immunoglobulin heavy chain
constant region (Fc), e.g., from IgGI.
        In some cases, the CD33/S100A9 antagonist is multivalent, e.g., it contains at least 2, 3,
or more S100A9-binding domains. In some cases, the antagonist contains at least one CD33
ectodomain and a S1 00A9-binding domain selected from the group consisting of a TLR4
ectodomain and a RAGE ectodomain.
        Multiple copies of the fusion protein can also be combined to form a multivalent
complex. Therefore, in some embodiments, two or more fusion proteins can be linked to a core
molecule or particle. In its simplest form, a multivalent complex comprises a multimer of two or
three or four or more of the disclosed fusion proteins associated (e.g. covalently or otherwise
                                                 16

    WO 2015/003149                                                            PCT/US2014/045444
linked) with one another preferably via a linker molecule. Suitable linker molecules include
multivalent attachment molecules such as avidin, streptavidin and extravidin, each of which can
have four binding sites for biotin.
        In some embodiments, the fusion protein can be biotinylated. Once biotinylated, the
biotinylated fusion protein can then be conjugated to a tetrameric streptavidin. Proteins can be
biotinylated chemically or enzymatically. Chemical biotinylation utilises various conjugation
chemistries to yield nonspecific biotinylation of amines, carboxylates, sulfhydryls and
carbohydrates. Enzymatic biotinylation results in biotinylation of a specific lysine within a
certain sequence by a bacterial biotin ligase. Most chemical biotinylation reagents consist of a
reactive group attached via a linker to the valeric acid side chain of biotin. This linker can also
mediate the solubility of biotinylation reagents; linkers that incorporate poly(ethylene) glycol
(PEG) can make water-insoluble reagents soluble or increase the solubility of biotinylation
reagents that are already soluble to some extent.
         Enzymatic biotinylation is most often carried out by genetically linking the protein of
interest at its N-terminus, C-terminus or at an internal loop to a 15 amino acid biotin acceptor
peptide, also termed AviTagTM or Acceptor Peptide (AP). The tagged protein is then incubated
with biotin ligase (BirA) in the presence of biotin and ATP. Enzymatic biotinylation can be
carried out in vitro but BirA also reacts specifically with its target peptide inside mammalian and
bacterial cells and at the cell surface, while other cellular proteins are not modified. Therefore,
the fusion protein can further contain a biotin acceptor peptide that can be biotinylated with BirA
in the presence of biotin and ATP. For example, the Fc portion can be enzymatically
biotinylated using the AviTagTM system (Avidity, LLC, Aurora, Colorado), which involves
incorporating a 15 amino acid peptide sequence into the chimeric fusion protein that can be
biotinylated by the BirA enzyme of E. coli. In some embodiments, this biotin acceptor peptide
has the amino acid sequence GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE (SEQ ID NO:7).
        Oligonucleotides are readily biotinylated in the course of oligonucleotide synthesis by the
phosphoramidite method using biotin phosphoramidite. Upon the standard deprotection, the
conjugates obtained can be purified using reverse-phase or anion-exchange HPLC.
        In other embodiments, two or more fusion proteins are conjugated to the surface of a
liposome or other microparticle to form the multivalent complex. A number of reports describe
the attachment of antibodies to liposomes. For example, US 5,620,689 discloses so-called
"immunoliposomes" in which antibody or antibody fragments effective to bind to a chosen
antigen on a B lymphocyte or a T lymphocyte, are attached to the distal ends of the membrane
                                                   17

    WO 2015/003149                                                           PCT/US2014/045444
lipids in liposomes having a surface coating of polyethylene glycol chains. In some
embodiments, the disclosed multivalent complexes comprising immunoliposomes containing
antibodies that specifically bind the disclosed fusion proteins. For example, the antibodies can
bind the Fc portion of the fusion protein, or tag on the protein, such as the biotin acceptor
peptide.
         The multivalent complex can be homogeneous, i.e., containing multiple copies of one
type of one fusion protein, or it can be heterogeneous. For example, the multivalent complex can
contain combinations of CD33 and TLR4 fusion proteins. In addition, the multivalent complex
can contain multivalent fusion proteins, i.e., at least two fusion protein containing two or more
Si 00A9-binding domains.
         The disclosed chimeric fusion proteins can also contain a peptide linker sequences
connecting the one or more CD33 and/or TLR4 ectodomains to each other, to the Fc portion, or
any combination thereof. For example, the peptide linker can have the amino acid sequence
DIEGRMD (SEQ ID NO:8).
         In other embodiments, the CD33/S100A9 inhibitor binds and inhibits endogenous CD33
receptor on MDSCs. For example, the CD33/S100A9 inhibitor can be a recombinant protein that
binds CD33 without activating MDSCs and competes for binding of endogenous S1 00A9 (e.g., a
mutant or truncated variant of S100A9).
        Antibodies
        Antibodies that can be used in the disclosed compositions and methods include whole
immunoglobulin (i.e., an intact antibody) of any class, fragments thereof, and synthetic proteins
containing at least the antigen binding variable domain of an antibody. The variable domains
differ in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular
antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not usually evenly distributed
through the variable domains of antibodies. It is typically concentrated in three segments called
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions both in the light chain
and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of the variable
domains are called the framework (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains
each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three
CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure.
The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the
CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies.

    WO 2015/003149                                                          PCT/US2014/045444
        Also disclosed are fragments of antibodies which have bioactivity. The fragments,
whether attached to other sequences or not, include insertions, deletions, substitutions, or other
selected modifications of particular regions or specific amino acids residues, provided the
activity of the fragment is not significantly altered or impaired compared to the nonmodified
antibody or antibody fragment.
         Techniques can also be adapted for the production of single-chain antibodies specific to
an antigenic protein of the present disclosure. Methods for the production of single-chain
antibodies are well known to those of skill in the art. A single chain antibody can be created by
fusing together the variable domains of the heavy and light chains using a short peptide linker,
thereby reconstituting an antigen binding site on a single molecule. Single-chain antibody
variable fragments (scFvs) in which the C-terminus of one variable domain is tethered to the N
terminus of the other variable domain via a 15 to 25 amino acid peptide or linker have been
developed without significantly disrupting antigen binding or specificity of the binding. The
linker is chosen to permit the heavy chain and light chain to bind together in their proper
conformational orientation.
         Divalent single-chain variable fragments (di-scFvs) can be engineered by linking two
scFvs. This can be done by producing a single peptide chain with two VH and two VL regions,
yielding tandem scFvs. ScFvs can also be designed with linker peptides that are too short for the
two variable regions to fold together (about five amino acids), forcing scFvs to dimerize. This
type is known as diabodies. Diabodies have been shown to have dissociation constants up to 40
fold lower than corresponding scFvs, meaning that they have a much higher affinity to their
target. Still shorter linkers (one or two amino acids) lead to the formation of trimers (triabodies
or tribodies). Tetrabodies have also been produced. They exhibit an even higher affinity to their
targets than diabodies.
        Aptamers
         The term "aptamer" refers to oligonucleic acid or peptide molecules that bind to a
specific target molecule. These molecules are generally selected from a random sequence pool.
The selected aptamers are capable of adapting unique tertiary structures and recognizing target
molecules with high affinity and specificity. A "nucleic acid aptamer" is a DNA or RNA
oligonucleic acid that binds to a target molecule via its conformation, and thereby inhibits or
suppresses functions of such molecule. A nucleic acid aptamer may be constituted by DNA,
RNA, or a combination thereof. A "peptide aptamer" is a combinatorial protein molecule with a
variable peptide sequence inserted within a constant scaffold protein. Identification of peptide

     WO 2015/003149                                                         PCT/US2014/045444
aptamers is typically performed under stringent yeast dihybrid conditions, which enhances the
probability for the selected peptide aptamers to be stably expressed and correctly folded in an
intracellular context.
         Nucleic acid aptamers are typically oligonucleotides ranging from 15-50 bases in length
that fold into defined secondary and tertiary structures, such as stem-loops or G-quartets.
Nucleic acid aptamers preferably bind the target molecule with a Kd less than 10-6, 10-', 10- , or
 10-12. Nucleic acid aptamers can also bind the target molecule with a very high degree of
specificity. It is preferred that the nucleic acid aptamers have a Kd with the target molecule at
least 10, 100, 1000, 10,000, or 100,000 fold lower than the Kd of other non-targeted molecules.
         Nucleic acid aptamers are typically isolated from complex libraries of synthetic
oligonucleotides by an iterative process of adsorption, recovery and reamplification. For
example, nucleic acid aptamers may be prepared using the SELEX (Systematic Evolution of
Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) method. The SELEX method involves selecting an RNA
molecule bound to a target molecule from an RNA pool composed of RNA molecules each
having random sequence regions and primer-binding regions at both ends thereof, amplifying the
recovered RNA molecule via RT-PCR, performing transcription using the obtained cDNA
molecule as a template, and using the resultant as an RNA pool for the subsequent procedure.
Such procedure is repeated several times to several tens of times to select RNA with a stronger
ability to bind to a target molecule. The base sequence lengths of the random sequence region
and the primer binding region are not particularly limited. In general, the random sequence
region contains about 20 to 80 bases and the primer binding region contains about 15 to 40
bases. Specificity to a target molecule may be enhanced by prospectively mixing molecules
similar to the target molecule with RNA pools and using a pool containing RNA molecules that
did not bind to the molecule of interest. An RNA molecule that was obtained as a final product
by such technique is used as an RNA aptamer. An aptamer database containing comprehensive
sequence information on aptamers and unnatural ribozymes that have been generated by in vitro
selection methods is available at aptamer.icmb.utexas.edu.
         A nucleic acid aptamer generally has higher specificity and affinity to a target molecule
than an antibody. Accordingly, a nucleic acid aptamer can specifically, directly, and firmly bind
to a target molecule. Since the number of target amino acid residues necessary for binding may
be smaller than that of an antibody, for example, a nucleic acid aptamer is superior to an
antibody, when selective suppression of functions of a given protein among highly homologous
proteins is intended.
                                                   20

    WO 2015/003149                                                          PCT/US2014/045444
         Non-modified nucleic acid aptamers are cleared rapidly from the bloodstream, with a
half-life of minutes to hours, mainly due to nuclease degradation and clearance from the body by
the kidneys, a result of the aptamer's inherently low molecular weight. This rapid clearance can
be an advantage in applications such as in vivo diagnostic imaging. However, several
modifications, such as 2'-fluorine-substituted pyrimidines, polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkage,
etc. are available to increase the serum half-life of aptamers to the day or even week time scale.
         Another approach to increase the nuclease resistance of aptamers is to use a Spiegelmer.
Spiegelmers are ribonucleic acid (RNA)-like molecules built from the unnatural L
ribonucleotides. Spiegelmers are therefore the stereochemical mirror images (enantiomers) of
natural oligonucleotides. Like other aptamers, Spiegelmers are able to bind target molecules such
as proteins. The affinity of Spiegelmers to their target molecules often lies in the pico-to
nanomolar range and is thus comparable to antibodies. In contrast to other aptamers,
Spiegelmers have high stability in blood serum since they are less susceptible to be cleaved
hydrolytically by enzymes. Nonetheless, they are excreted by the kidneys in a short time due to
their low molar mass. Unlike other aptamers, Spiegelmers may not be directly produced by the
SELEX method. This is because L-nucleic acids are not amenable to enzymatic methods, such as
polymerase chain reaction. Instead, the sequence of a natural aptamer identified by the SELEX
method is determined and then used in the artificial synthesis of the mirror image of the natural
aptamer.
         Peptide aptamers are proteins that are designed to interfere with other protein interactions
inside cells. They consist of a variable peptide loop attached at both ends to a scaffold. This
double structural constraint greatly increases the binding affinity of the peptide aptamer to levels
comparable to an antibody.
         The variable loop length is typically composed of about ten to twenty amino acids, and
the scaffold may be any protein which has good solubility. Currently, the bacterial protein
Thioredoxin-A is the most used scaffold protein, the variable loop being inserted within the
reducing active site, the two Cysteines lateral chains being able to form a disulfide bridge.
         Peptide aptamer selection can be made using different systems, but the most used is
currently the yeast two-hybrid system. Peptide aptamer can also be selected from combinatorial
peptide libraries constructed by phage display and other surface display technologies such as
mRNA display, ribosome display, bacterial display and yeast display. These experimental
procedures are also known as biopannings. Among peptides obtained from biopannings,

mimotopes can be considered as a kind of peptide aptamers. All the peptides panned from
combinatorial peptide libraries have been stored in a special database with the name MimoDB.
         Pharmaceutical Composition
         The disclosed compositions can be used therapeutically in combination with a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. By "pharmaceutically acceptable" is meant a material that
is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., the material may be administered to a subject,
along with the nucleic acid or vector, without causing any undesirable biological effects or
interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the pharmaceutical
composition in which it is contained. The carrier would naturally be selected to minimize any
degradation of the active ingredient and to minimize any adverse side effects in the subject, as
would be well known to one of skill in the art.
         Suitable carriers and their formulations are described in Remington: The Science and
Practice of Pharmacy (19th ed.) ed. A.R. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA 1995.
Typically, an appropriate amount of a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt is used in the formulation
to render the formulation isotonic. Examples of the pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier include,
but are not limited to, saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. The pH of the solution is
preferably from about 5 to about 8, and more preferably from about 7 to about 7.5. Further
carriers include sustained release preparations such as semipermeable matrices of solid
hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped
articles, e.g., films, liposomes or microparticles. It will be apparent to those persons skilled in
the art that certain carriers may be more preferable depending upon, for instance, the route of
administration and concentration of composition being administered.
         Pharmaceutical carriers are known to those skilled in the art. These most typically would
be standard carriers for administration of drugs to humans, including solutions such as sterile
water, saline, and buffered solutions at physiological pH. The compositions can be administered
intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Other compounds will be administered according to standard
procedures used by those skilled in the art.
         Pharmaceutical compositions may include carriers, thickeners, diluents, buffers,
preservatives, surface active agents and the like in addition to the molecule of choice.
Pharmaceutical compositions may also include one or more active ingredients such as
antimicrobial agents, antiinflammatory agents, anesthetics, and the like.
         Preparations for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous
solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol,
                                                   22

   WO 2015/003149                                                           PCT/US2014/045444
polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl
oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions,
including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution,
Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's, or fixed oils. Intravenous
vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers (such as those based on
Ringer's dextrose), and the like. Preservatives and other additives may also be present such as,
for example, antimicrobials, anti-oxidants, chelating agents, and inert gases and the like.
        Compositions for oral administration include powders or granules, suspensions or
solutions in water or non-aqueous media, capsules, sachets, or tablets. Thickeners, flavorings,
diluents, emulsifiers, dispersing aids or binders may be desirable.
        Some of the compositions may potentially be administered as a pharmaceutically
acceptable acid- or base- addition salt, formed by reaction with inorganic acids such as
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, perchloric acid, nitric acid, thiocyanic acid, sulfuric acid,
and phosphoric acid, and organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic
acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, and fumaric
acid, or by reaction with an inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide,
potassium hydroxide, and organic bases such as mono-, di-, trialkyl and aryl amines and
substituted ethanolamines.
        Methods of Treatment
        Also disclosed are methods for treating a disease in a subject that is caused or
exacerbated by S1 00A9 activity, comprising administering to the subject a composition
comprising a CD33/S100A9 antagonist disclosed herein.
        The innate immune system is crucial for initiation and amplification of inflammatory
responses. During this process, phagocytes are activated by PAMPs that are recognized by PRRs.
Phagocytes are also activated by endogenous danger signals called alarmins or DAMPs via
partly specific, partly common PRRs. Two members of the S100 protein family, S100A8 and
S1 00A9, have been identified recently as important endogenous DAMPs. The complex of
S1 00A8 and S1 00A9 (also called calprotectin) is actively secreted during the stress response of
phagocytes. These molecules have been identified as endogenous activators of TLR4 and have
been shown to promote lethal, endotoxin-induced shock. Importantly, S1 00A8/S 100A9 is not
only involved in promoting the inflammatory response in infections but was also identified as a
potent amplifier of inflammation in autoimmunity as well as in cancer development and tumor
spread. This proinflammatory action of S1 00A8/S 100A9 involves autocrine and paracrine
                                                  23

    WO 2015/003149                                                              PCT/US2014/045444
mechanisms in phagocytes, endothelium, and other cells. As a net result, extravasation of
leukocytes into inflamed tissues and their subsequent activation are increased. Thus,
Si 00A8/S 100A9 plays a pivotal role during amplification of inflammation.
         Diseases that are associated with S1 00A8/S 100A9 activity include, but are not limited to,
rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, sepsis, atherosclerosis, acute
coronary syndrome/myocardial infarction, diabetes, psoriasis/inflammatory skin disease,
inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis, transplant rejection, SLE/glomerulonephritis,
pancreatitis, cancer, dermatomyositis/polymyositis, and hyperzincemia/systemic inflammation.
In addition, disease characterized by recurrent infections, hepato-splenomegaly, anemia,
vasculopathie, concomitant cutaneous ulcers, and systemic inflammation are defined by
extraordinarily high levels of S1 00A8/S 100A9 in extracellular fluids.
         In some embodiments, the method involves treating infection and/or preventing sepsis in
a patient in need thereof. Sepsis is caused by the immune system's response to a serious
infection, most commonly bacteria, but also fungi, viruses, and parasites in the blood, urinary
tract, lungs, skin, or other tissues. There are number of microbial factors which can cause the
typical septic inflammatory cascade. An invading pathogen is recognised by its pathogen
associated molecular pattern (PAMP). Examples of PAMPs are lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in
Gram-negative bacteria, flagellin in Gram-negative bacteria, muramyl dipeptide in the
peptidoglycan cell wall of a Gram-positive bacteria and CpG bacterial DNA. These PAMPs are
recognized by the innate immune system's pattern recognition receptors (PRR). There are four
families of PRRs: the toll-like receptors, the C-type lectin receptors, the nucleotide
oligemerization domain-like receptors and the RigI-helicases. S100A8/S100A9 acts as an
endogenous TLR4 ligand involved in amplification of LPS effects on phagocytes upstream of
TNF-a. Although TNF-a is critical for LPS toxicity, blockade of TNF-a had a harmful rather
than protective effect in human sepsis. Moreover, in a small study, S1 00A8/S 1 00A9 levels were
demonstrated to decrease in surviving patients during recovery from sepsis, and nonsurvivors
were characterized by high S100A8/S100A9 serum levels. Sepsis is usually treated with
intravenous fluids and antibiotics. The disclosed CD33/S100A9 antagonist can be used instead
of, or in addition to, intravenous antibiotics.
         In some embodiments, the method involves treating an inflammatory and/or autoimmune
disease in a patient in need thereof. S1 00A8/S 100A9 contributes to the pathogenesis of different
types of arthritis. Macrophage-derived S100A8/S100A9 amplifies the inflammatory response in
antigen-induced arthritis and also acts as endogenous DAMP in the absence of infection or

pathogenic agents. Autoimmunity is the failure of an organism in recognizing its own constituent
parts as self, thus leading to an immune response against its own cells and tissues. Any disease
that results from such an aberrant immune response is termed an autoimmune or
autoinflammatory disease. Autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases share common
characteristics in that both groups of disorders result from the immune system attacking the
body's own tissues, and also result in increased inflammation. Prominent examples include

such as hormone replacement in Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Type 1 diabetes mellitus treat
outcomes of the autoaggressive response, thus these are palliative treatments. Dietary
manipulation limits the severity of celiac disease. Steroidal or NSAID treatment limits
inflammatory symptoms of many diseases. IVIG is used for CIDP and GBS. Specific
immunomodulatory therapies, such as the TNFa antagonists (e.g. etanercept), the B cell
depleting agent rituximab, the anti-IL-6 receptor tocilizumab and the costimulation blocker
abatacept have been shown to be useful in treating RA. Some of these immunotherapies may be

associated with increased risk of adverse effects, such as susceptibility to infection. The
disclosed CD33/S100A9 antagonist can be used instead of, or in addition to, these existing
treatments.
        In some embodiments, the method involves treating a neurodegenerative disease or
disorder in a patient in need thereof. As used herein, "neurodegenerative disease" includes
neurodegenerative disease associated with protein aggregation, also referred to as "protein
aggregation disorders", "protein conformation disorders", or "proteinopathies".
Neurodegenerative disease associated with protein aggregation include diseases or disorders
characterized by the formation of detrimental intracellular protein aggregates (e.g., inclusions in
the cytosol or nucleus) or extracellular protein aggregates (e.g., plaques). "Detrimental protein
aggregation" is the undesirable and harmful accumulation, oligomerization, fibrillization or
aggregation, of two or more, hetero- or homomeric, proteins or peptides. A detrimental protein
aggregate may be deposited in bodies, inclusions or plaques, the characteristics of which are
often indicative of disease and contain disease- specific proteins. For example, superoxide
dismutase-1 aggregates are associated with ALS, poly-Q aggregates are associated with
Huntington's disease, and a-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies are associated with Parkinson's
disease.
        Neurological diseases are also associated with immune failure related to increasing
levels of disease-causing factors that exceed the ability of the immune system to contain, or a
situation in which immune function deteriorates or is suppressed concomitantly with disease
progression, due to factors indirectly or directly related to the disease-causing entity. MDSCs
can cause T-cell deficiency by suppressing effector T cell activity, thus promoting
neurodegenerative disease associated with immune failure.
        Representative examples of Protein Aggregation Disorders or Proteopathies include
Protein Conformational Disorders, Alpha-Synucleinopathies, Polyglutamine Diseases,
Serpinopathies, Tauopathies or other related disorders. Other examples of neurological diseases

includes the pain caused by either central or peripheral nerve damage. And it includes the pain
caused by either mononeuropathy or polyneuropathy.
         In some cases, the method involves enhancing tumor immune response in a patient in
need thereof. Si 00A8/S 100A9 expression is increased in patients with various tumors. Soluble
factors secreted from tumor cells are believed to induce overexpression of S1 00A8/S 100A9,
resulting in increased generation of MDSCs. These MDSCs can inhibit anti-tumor responses by
CD8+ T cells and thus promote tumor growth. The cancer of the disclosed methods can be any
cell in a subject undergoing unregulated growth, invasion, or metastasis. In some aspects, the
cancer can be any neoplasm or tumor for which radiotherapy is currently used. In some aspects,
the cancer can be any tumor that is resistant to standard of care therapy. Thus, Also provided
are methods of sensitizing tumors to standard care therapy, comprising administering to the
subject an effective amount of a compound or composition as disclosed herein. For example, the
cancer can be a neoplasm or tumor that is not sufficiently sensitive to radiotherapy using
                                                  28

    WO 2015/003149                                                         PCT/US2014/045444
standard methods. Thus, the cancer can be a sarcoma, lymphoma, leukemia, carcinoma,
blastoma, or germ cell tumor. A representative but non-limiting list of cancers that the disclosed
compositions can be used to treat include lymphoma, B cell lymphoma, T cell lymphoma,
mycosis fungoides, Hodgkin's Disease, myeloid leukemia, bladder cancer, brain cancer, nervous
system cancer, head and neck cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck, kidney cancer,
lung cancers such as small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer,
neuroblastoma/glioblastoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer,
liver cancer, melanoma, squamous cell carcinomas of the mouth, throat, larynx, and lung, colon
cancer, cervical cancer, cervical carcinoma, breast cancer, epithelial cancer, renal cancer,
genitourinary cancer, pulmonary cancer, esophageal carcinoma, head and neck carcinoma, large
bowel cancer, hematopoietic cancers; testicular cancer; colon and rectal cancers, prostatic
cancer, and pancreatic cancer. The disclosed CD33/S100A9 antagonist can be used instead of, or
in addition to, existing antineoplastic drugs and/or radiation treatments.
        As disclosed herein, LIN-HLA-DR-CD33* MDSCs specifically accumulate in the BM of
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients and impair hematopoiesis through a mechanism that
involves S100A9 as an endogenous ligand for CD33 initiated signaling. Therefore, the disclosed
method can involve treating MDS in a patient in need thereof. The myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS) are hematological (blood-related) medical conditions with ineffective production (or
dysplasia) of the myeloid class of blood cells. In some cases, the MDS patient has a chromosome
5q deletion (del(5q)). However, in other cases, the patient has non-del5q MDS. Although three
agents are approved for the treatment of MDS in the United States (US), lenalidomide (LEN)
represents the only targeted therapeutic. Therefore, the disclosed CD33/S100A9 antagonist can
be used instead of, or in addition to, lenalidomide.
        In some embodiments, the method involves treating anemia of chronic disease (including
cancer-related anemia) in a patient, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount
of a composition as disclosed herein.
        Administration
        The disclosed CD33/S100A9 inhibitors may be administered in a therapeutically
effective amount to a subject to treat a disease caused or exacerbated by S100A9 activity. The
disclosed compositions, including pharmaceutical composition, may be administered in a
number of ways depending on whether local or systemic treatment is desired, and on the area to
be treated. For example, the disclosed compositions can be administered intravenously,
intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracavity, or transdermally. The
                                                  29

    WO 2015/003149                                                            PCT/US2014/045444
compositions may be administered orally, parenterally (e.g., intravenously), by intramuscular
injection, by intraperitoneal injection, transdermally, extracorporeally, ophthalmically, vaginally,
rectally, intranasally, topically or the like, including topical intranasal administration or
administration by inhalant.
         Parenteral administration of the composition, if used, is generally characterized by
injection. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or
suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution of suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as
emulsions. A revised approach for parenteral administration involves use of a slow release or
sustained release system such that a constant dosage is maintained. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No.
3,610,795, which is incorporated by reference herein.
         The compositions disclosed herein may be administered prophylactically to patients or
subjects who are at risk for MDS. Thus, the method can further comprise identifying a subject at
risk for MDS prior to administration of the herein disclosed compositions.
         The exact amount of the compositions required will vary from subject to subject,
depending on the species, age, weight and general condition of the subject, the severity of the
allergic disorder being treated, the particular nucleic acid or vector used, its mode of
administration and the like. Thus, it is not possible to specify an exact amount for every
composition. However, an appropriate amount can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the
art using only routine experimentation given the teachings herein. For example, effective
dosages and schedules for administering the compositions may be determined empirically, and
making such determinations is within the skill in the art. The dosage ranges for the
administration of the compositions are those large enough to produce the desired effect in which
the symptoms disorder are effected. The dosage should not be so large as to cause adverse side
effects, such as unwanted cross-reactions, anaphylactic reactions, and the like. Generally, the
dosage will vary with the age, condition, sex and extent of the disease in the patient, route of
administration, or whether other drugs are included in the regimen, and can be determined by
one of skill in the art. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any
counterindications. Dosage can vary, and can be administered in one or more dose
administrations daily, for one or several days. Guidance can be found in the literature for
appropriate dosages for given classes of pharmaceutical products. For example, guidance in
selecting appropriate doses for antibodies can be found in the literature on therapeutic uses of
antibodies, e.g., Handbook of Monoclonal Antibodies, Ferrone et al., eds., Noges Publications,
Park Ridge, N.J., (1985) ch. 22 and pp. 303-357; Smith et al., Antibodies in Human Diagnosis

and Therapy, Haber et al., eds., Raven Press, New York (1977) pp. 365-389. A typical daily
dosage of the antibody used alone might range from about 1 gg/kg to up to 100 mg/kg of body
weight or more per day, depending on the factors mentioned above.
         Screening Methods
        Also provided herein is a method of identifying an agent that can be used to treat MDS in
a subject. The method can comprise providing a sample comprising CD33 and S100A9 under
conditions that allow CD33 and S100A9 to bind, contacting the sample with a candidate agent,
detecting the level of CD33/S100A9 binding, and comparing the binding level to a control,
wherein a decrease in CD33/S100A9 binding compared to the control identifies an agent that can
be used to treat an inflammatory disease.
         The binding of S100A9 to CD33 can be detected using routine methods, such as
immunodetection methods, that do not disturb protein binding. The methods can be cell-based or
cell-free assays. The steps of various useful immunodetection methods have been described in
the scientific literature, such as, e.g., Maggio et al., Enzyme-Immunoassay, (1987) and
Nakamura, et al., Enzyme Immunoassays: Heterogeneous and Homogeneous Systems,
Handbook of Experimental Immunology, Vol. 1: Immunochemistry, 27.1-27.20 (1986), each of
which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and specifically for its teaching
regarding immunodetection methods. Immunoassays, in their most simple and direct sense, are
binding assays involving binding between antibodies and antigen. Many types and formats of
immunoassays are known and all are suitable for detecting the disclosed biomarkers. Examples
of immunoassays are enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), radioimmunoassays
(RIA), radioimmune precipitation assays (RIPA), immunobead capture assays, Western blotting,
dot blotting, gel-shift assays, Flow cytometry, protein arrays, multiplexed bead arrays, magnetic
capture, in vivo imaging, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and fluorescence
recovery/localization after photobleaching (FRAP/ FLAP).
         In general, candidate agents can be identified from large libraries of natural products or
synthetic (or semi-synthetic) extracts or chemical libraries according to methods known in the
art. Those skilled in the field of drug discovery and development will understand that the precise
source of test extracts or compounds is not critical to the screening procedure(s) used.
        Accordingly, virtually any number of chemical extracts or compounds can be screened
using the exemplary methods described herein. Examples of such extracts or compounds include,
but are not limited to, plant-, fungal-, prokaryotic- or animal-based extracts, fermentation broths,
and synthetic compounds, as well as modification of existing compounds. Numerous methods

    WO 2015/003149                                                          PCT/US2014/045444
are also available for generating random or directed synthesis (e.g., semi-synthesis or total
synthesis) of any number of chemical compounds, including, but not limited to, saccharide-,
lipid-, peptide-, and nucleic acid-based compounds. Synthetic compound libraries are
commercially available, e.g., from purveyors of chemical libraries including but not limited to
ChemBridge Corporation (16981 Via Tazon, Suite G, San Diego, CA, 92127, USA,
www.chembridge.com); ChemDiv (6605 Nancy Ridge Drive, San Diego, CA 92121, USA); Life
Chemicals (1103 Orange Center Road, Orange, CT 06477); Maybridge (Trevillett, Tintagel,
Cornwall PL34 OHW, UK)
         Alternatively, libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant, and
animal extracts are commercially available from a number of sources, including 02H,
(Cambridge, UK), MerLion Pharmaceuticals Pte Ltd (Singapore Science Park II, Singapore
 117528) and Galapagos NV (Generaal De Wittelaan LII A3, B-2800 Mechelen, Belgium).
         In addition, natural and synthetically produced libraries are produced, if desired,
according to methods known in the art, e.g., by standard extraction and fractionation methods or
by standard synthetic methods in combination with solid phase organic synthesis, micro-wave
synthesis and other rapid throughput methods known in the art to be amenable to making large
numbers of compounds for screening purposes. Furthermore, if desired, any library or
compound, including sample format and dissolution is readily modified and adjusted using
standard chemical, physical, or biochemical methods. In addition, those skilled in the art of drug
discovery and development readily understand that methods for dereplication (e.g., taxonomic
dereplication, biological dereplication, and chemical dereplication, or any combination thereof)
or the elimination of replicates or repeats of materials already known for their effect on MDS
should be employed whenever possible.
         Candidate agents encompass numerous chemical classes, but are most often organic
molecules, e.g., small organic compounds having a molecular weight of more than 100 and less
than about 2,500 Daltons. Candidate agents can include functional groups necessary for
structural interaction with proteins, particularly hydrogen bonding, and typically include at least
an amine, carbonyl, hydroxyl or carboxyl group, for example, at least two of the functional
chemical groups. The candidate agents often contain cyclical carbon or heterocyclic structures
and/or aromatic or polyaromatic structures substituted with one or more of the above functional
groups.
         In some embodiments, the candidate agents are proteins. In some aspects, the candidate
agents are naturally occurring proteins or fragments of naturally occurring proteins. Thus, for
                                                   32

    WO 2015/003149                                                          PCT/US2014/045444
example, cellular extracts containing proteins, or random or directed digests of proteinaceous
cellular extracts, can be used. In this way libraries of procaryotic and eucaryotic proteins can be
made for screening using the methods herein. The libraries can be bacterial, fungal, viral, and
vertebrate proteins, and human proteins.
        Definitions
        The term "antibody" refers to natural or synthetic antibodies that selectively bind a target
antigen. The term includes polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. In addition to intact
immunoglobulin molecules, also included in the term "antibodies" are fragments or polymers of
those immunoglobulin molecules, and human or humanized versions of immunoglobulin
molecules that selectively bind the target antigen.
        A "chimeric molecule" is a single molecule created by joining two or more molecules
that exist separately in their native state. The single, chimeric molecule has the desired
functionality of all of its constituent molecules.
        A "fusion protein" refers to a polypeptide formed by the joining of two or more
polypeptides through a peptide bond formed between the amino terminus of one polypeptide and
the carboxyl terminus of another polypeptide. The fusion protein can be formed by the chemical
coupling of the constituent polypeptides or it can be expressed as a single polypeptide from
nucleic acid sequence encoding the single contiguous fusion protein. A single chain fusion
protein is a fusion protein having a single contiguous polypeptide backbone. Fusion proteins can
be prepared using conventional techniques in molecular biology to join the two genes in frame
into a single nucleic acid, and then expressing the nucleic acid in an appropriate host cell under
conditions in which the fusion protein is produced.
        The term "inhibit" refers to a decrease in an activity, response, condition, disease, or
other biological parameter. This can include but is not limited to the complete ablation of the
activity, response, condition, or disease. This may also include, for example, a 10% reduction in
the activity, response, condition, or disease as compared to the native or control level. Thus, the
reduction can be a 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100%, or any amount of reduction in
between as compared to native or control levels.
        A "liposome" is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids, phospholipids
and/or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug (such as the antagonists disclosed herein
and, optionally, a chemotherapeutic agent) to a mammal. The components of the liposome are
commonly arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological
membranes.
                                                    33

    WO 2015/003149                                                           PCT/US2014/045444
          The terms "peptide," "protein," and "polypeptide" are used interchangeably to refer to a
natural or synthetic molecule comprising two or more amino acids linked by the carboxyl group
of one amino acid to the alpha amino group of another.
         The term "percent (%) sequence identity" or "homology" is defined as the percentage of
nucleotides or amino acids in a candidate sequence that are identical with the nucleotides or
amino acids in a reference nucleic acid sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing
gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. Alignment for purposes
of determining percent sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the
skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST,
BLAST-2, ALIGN, ALIGN-2 or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Appropriate parameters for
measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the
full-length of the sequences being compared can be determined by known methods.
         The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to those compounds, materials,
compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment,
suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive
toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problems or complications commensurate with a
reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
         The term "specifically binds", as used herein, when referring to a polypeptide (including
antibodies) or receptor, refers to a binding reaction which is determinative of the presence of the
protein or polypeptide or receptor in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics.
Thus, under designated conditions (e.g. immunoassay conditions in the case of an antibody), a
specified ligand or antibody "specifically binds" to its particular "target" (e.g. an antibody
specifically binds to an endothelial antigen) when it does not bind in a significant amount to
other proteins present in the sample or to other proteins to which the ligand or antibody may
come in contact in an organism. Generally, a first molecule that "specifically binds" a second
molecule has an affinity constant (Ka) greater than about 105 M-1 (e.g., 106 M-     , 107 M-1, 101 M
 , 109 M-1, 101 M-, 10" M- 1, and 101       M-1  or more) with that second molecule.
         The term "subject" refers to any individual who is the target of administration or
treatment. The subject can be a vertebrate, for example, a mammal. Thus, the subject can be a
human or veterinary patient. The term "patient" refers to a subject under the treatment of a
clinician, e.g., physician.
                                                    34

    WO 2015/003149                                                            PCT/US2014/045444
        The term "therapeutically effective" refers to the amount of the composition used is of
sufficient quantity to ameliorate one or more causes or symptoms of a disease or disorder. Such
amelioration only requires a reduction or alteration, not necessarily elimination.
        The term "treatment" refers to the medical management of a patient with the intent to
cure, ameliorate, stabilize, or prevent a disease, pathological condition, or disorder. This term

        Methods
        MDSpatients.The majority of patients with MDS were low risk unless otherwise
specified. All patients were confirmed by central review and classified in accordance with either
the World Health Organization criteria or International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS).
Patients were recruited from the Malignant Hematology clinic at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer
Center & Research Institute and the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Department
of Hematology in the Netherlands. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) were isolated
from heparinized BM aspirates by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation, as previously
described (Wei, S., et al. 2009. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 106:12974-12979). MDSCs were
defined and purified by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) of CD33m cells lacking
expression of lineage (Lin-) markers (CD3, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD20, CD56) and HLA-DR.

    WO 2015/003149                                                       PCT/US2014/045444
         Mice. All mouse work was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at the University of South Florida. Wild type (WT) FVB/NJ mice were purchased
from Jackson Laboratories, and S1 00A9 knockout mice (KO) and S1 00A9 transgenic mice (Tg)
were generated and used as previously described (Cheng, P., et al. 2008. J Exp Med 205:2235
2249; Manitz, M.P., et al. 2003. Mol Cell Biol 23:1034-1043). S100A9Tg mice were generated
from FVB/NJ homozygous mice and bred for more than 15 generations. For the competitive
transplant experiment, 18 week old FVB/NJ wild type female mice were irradiated once in a
rotating gamma irradiator for a total dose of 900Gy. Concurrently, BM cells were isolated from
the tibias and femurs of age-matched male WT or S1 0OA9Tg mice from which HSCs were then
enriched by magnetic cell sorting (MACS, Millitenyi Biotech) following the manufacturer's
protocol. Six hours post-irradiation 1x10 7 enriched HSCs were given by tail vein injection into
recipient mice. Mice were then monitored every other day with weight measurements under a
sterile hood. Peripheral blood for CBC was collected from the antero-orbital vein by Vivarium
staff at the center weekly. By 8 weeks (after which the WT recipients were engrafted, WBC >
3x10 3 cells/ml of blood) mice were euthanized by CO 2 aspiration at which point peripheral
blood was collected by heart puncture followed by dissection of tibias and femurs (as before)
and spleen for assessment.
         Fluorescencein situ hybridization (FISH). FISH was done at the Cytogenetics
Laboratory of Moffitt Cancer Center, and detailed methods have been previously described
(Wei, S., et al. 2009. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 106:12974-12979). Target DNA from MDSC
positive (MDS-MDSC) cells and MDSC negative cells was purified from the same patients who
were previously confirmed to have del5q or del7q using a commercially available test (Abbott
laboratory).
         Immunostaining. BM-MNCs were purified from MDS patients, diluted to a concentration
of 3x1 05 cells/ml, cytospinned onto microscope slides and fixed with methanol/acetone (3:1 ratio
at -20 0C for 30 min). Washes were done with triton X-100 buffer for 5 min and 50 mM Tris
Buffer (pH 7.4) for 10 min prior to blocking for non-specific binding with serum. 5he slides
were stained with the primary antibodies: rabbit anti-CD33 antibody (1:100 dilution, Santa
Cruz), mouse anti-granzyme B (1:100 dilution, Fitzgerald Industries) and mouse anti-human
CD71 (1:100 dilution, BD Biosciences) followed by their respective secondary antibodies,
AlexaFluor-594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen), FITC goat anti-mouse (Sigma) and Alexa-350
goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Rat anti-human glycophorin A was pre-conjugated to
Alexa-647 using a kit from Molecular Probes) before addition to the sample (1:50 dilution, AbD

Serotec) followed by mounting the slides with aqueous medium (Molecular Probes, USA).
Immunofluorescence was detected using a Zeiss automated upright fluorescence microscope and
images captured by a Nikon camera with the Capture Program AxioVision. Detailed methods for
immuno-staining on S100A9 transfected SJCRH30 cells have been published previously (Chen,
X., et al. 2008. Blood 113(14):3226-34). Specifically, SJCRH30 cells, which lack detectable
expression levels of both CD33 and S100A9, were transfected with either S100A9 or S100A8
(negative control) for 48-72 hours. After incubation with CD33-fusion for 30 min (2pg/ml), 1 x
 104 cells were cytospinned onto slides and then stained with a secondary anti-human IgG1-APC
before analysis by immunofluorescence microscopy. Similarly, SJCRH30 cells, stable
transfected with CD33, were incubated with rhS1OOA9 tagged with DDK for various time points
and stained by the same methodology before analysis.
         Suppression assays. To determine whether MDSCs are capable of mediating T cell
suppression, CD45 CD33 CD1 1b- Lin cells were sorted from full bone marrow of MDS
patients by FACS. The following antibodies were used: CD45-PECy7, CD33-PECy5, CD1Ib
FITC, CD3-PE, CD14-PE, CD20-PE (all Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA), CD16-PE,
CD19-PE (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and CD56-PE (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA).
T cells were isolated by Magnetic Activated Cell Sorting (MACS) using CD3 microbeads
(Miltenyi Biotec, Aubern, CA, USA) from autologous peripheral blood. 20,000 T cells were
seeded in a 96 wells round bottom plate in triplicate in Iscove's modified Dulbecco medium
(IMDM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% human serum PAA (PAA
Laboratories, Pasching, Austria). Cultures were stimulated with 30 U/ml IL-2 (Chiron,
Emeryville, CA, USA), and anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
at a 1:2 ratio of T cells to beads. MDSCs were admixed with T cell cultures at ratios of 1:2 and
 1:4 and supplemented with 10 ng/ml GM-CSF to support MDSC viability. After 3 days of co
culture, culture supernatants were harvested to measure IFN-y concentration by ELISA (Pierce
Endogen, Rockford, IL, USA). Subsequently, 0.5          3H-thymidine
                                                    LCi               (Perkin Elmer, Groningen,
the Netherlands) was added to each well and, after overnight incubation, 3H -thymidine
incorporation was measured using a 1205 Wallac Betaplate counter (PerkinElmer). To determine
whether differences in proliferation and IFN- y production were statistically significant, one-way
Anova with Bonferroni post-hoc test was used. Statistical significance was accepted for p values
< 0.05.
         Colony-forming Assay. Cells isolated from either human BM, or from S1 0OA9Tg,
S1 0OA9KO or WT tibias and femurs were subjected to ACK for 5 min at room temperature

    WO 2015/003149                                                          PCT/US2014/045444
(Sigma) to lyse the red blood cells. Remaining BM cells were then seeded into complete
methylcellulose media (MethoCult complete medium with necessary cytokines and growth
factors (StemCell Technologies) and the mixture was placed in duplicate gridded 35-mm culture
dishes (2 x 105 cells/dish) and incubated at 37'C in 5% CO 2 for 7-14 days. After incubation,
colonies of BFU-E and CFU-GM were identified manually and counted using an inverted light
microscope. For the colony formation assays performed using ATRA treated mice, we
administered ATRA at 250 ig (200 il) or vehicle (Olive oil) orally for five consecutive days
before resting two days.
         mRNA expression by Real-time Quantitative.RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT
PCR) reactions were performed by means of iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The reaction
mixture (25     total) contained 12.5
               1tl                      1diQ SYBR green supermix, 0.25 tl forward primer (s
GAPDH) (20 jM), 11 1Il    RNase-free water, and 1.0jl cDNA. The following cycles were
performed 1 x 3 min at 95'C, 40 amplification cycles (15 s 95 'C, 60 s 56 'C), 1 x 1 min 95 'C,
 1 x 1 negative control without cDNA template was run with every assay. The optimal melting
point of dsDNA I and min 55 'C and a melting curve (80 x 10 s 55 'C with an increase of 0.5 'C
per 10 seconds). The efficiency of the reaction was optimized beforehand. Transcript copy
number per individual was calculated by normalization to GAPDH expression. The relative
level of gene expression for each patient was calculated by normalization to the average
expression level observed in five controls. CD33 transfected and un-transfected SJCRH 30 cells
were treated with 1 [tg of rhS10A9 for 20 min and the expression measured by Q-PCR for the
presence of IL 10 and TGFP from total RNA and calculated by the AACt method where
rhS 100A9 untreated cells were the experimental control and the housekeeping gene GAPDH was
the internal control. Error bars represent the SEM of three separate experiments.
         Preparationof the CD33/Siglec 3 chimericfusion protein. Recombinant soluble fusion of
CD33/Siglec 3 ectodomain were constructed as described previously (Cannon, J.P., et al. 2012.
Immunogenetics 64:39-47; Cannon, J.P., et al. 2011. Methods Mol Biol 748:51-67; Cannon, J.P.,
et al. 2008. Immunity 29:228-237). Specifically, cDNA fragments encoding CD33/Siglec 3
ectodomain were amplified by PCR and inserted into a vector that encodes the human Fcy
followed by a c-terminal recognition site for E. coli biotin ligase. This vector has been
engineered to facilitate the fusion of gene segments encoding extracellular Ig-type domains to
the Fc region of human IgG1. The recombinant proteins were expressed in 293T cells post
transfection, using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), with three successive harvests of 25 ml OPTI
MEM I serum-free medium. The harvests were pooled, centrifuged at 5OOg for 10 min to remove

 debris and stored at 4 'C in 0.02% sodium azide. Concentrations of CD33-fusions in culture
 supernatants were determined by Bradford assay (Biorad, Carlsbad, CA).
         Mass spectrometry.Following in-gel tryptic digestion, peptides were extracted and
 concentrated under vacuum centrifugation. A nanoflow liquid chromatograph (Easy-nLC,
 Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) coupled to an electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ,
 Thermo, San Jose, CA) was used for tandem mass spectrometry peptide sequencing
 experiments. The sample was first loaded onto a trap column (BioSphere C 18 reversed-phase
 resin, 5 gin, 120  A, 100 gm ID, NanoSeparations,    Nieuwkoop, Netherlands) and washed for 3
 minutes at 8 ml/minute. The trapped peptides were eluted onto the analytical column,
 (BioSphere C18 reversed-phase resin, 150 mm, 5 gin, 120 A, 100 gm ID, NanoSeparations,
 Nieuwkoop, Netherlands). Peptides were eluted in a 60 minute gradient from 5% B to 45% B
 (solvent A: 2% acetonitrile + 0.10% formic acid; solvent B: 90% acetonitrile + 0.10% formic acid)
 with a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Five tandem mass spectra were collected in a data-dependent
 manner following each survey scan. Sequences were assigned using Mascot
 (www.matrixscience.com) searches against human IPI entries. Carbamidomethylation of
 cysteine, methionine oxidation, and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine were selected as
 variable modifications, and as many as 2 missed tryptic cleavages were allowed. Precursor mass
 tolerance is set to 2.5 and fragment ion tolerance to 0.8. Results from Mascot were compiled in
 Scaffold, which was used for manual inspection of peptide assignments and protein
 identifications.
         Identifications of specific binding of SJ0OA9 to CD33/Siglec 3. ELISA assayfor CD33
fusion binding cell lysate of SJ0OA9 transfected SJCRH 30 cells. Ninety-six well flat-bottom
 ELISA plates were coated overnight with lug/ml of monoclonal anti-S100A9, as per the
 manufacturer's suggestions. After washing with 1 X PBS-T, 50 gl of lysates from un-transfected
 cells (negative) or S100A9 transfected cells was added to the wells. Secondary antibody was
 either a S100A9 polyclonal antibody (positive control) or CD33-fusion as indicated followed by
 ELISA HRP reaction analysis at 440 nm.
         Preparationof adenoviralvector expressing CD33. CD33 plasmid (GeneCopeia) was
 subcloned into a pShuttle-IRES-hrGFP-1 vector (containing the CMV promoter and hrGFP).
 The PmeI-digested shuttle vectors were then co-transformed into electro-competent BJ5183
 bacteria with pAdEasy-1 (containing the viral backbone) and selected on Kanamycin LB plates.
 The plasmid in the bacteria was amplified and purified using a plasmid maxiprep system
 (Qiagen). The complete adenoviral vector was linearized by Pac digestion and then transfected
                                                   39

into AD293 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). All recombinant adenoviruses were
amplified in AD293 cells. Viral stocks were obtained by amplification of the AD293 cells
followed by standard two-step CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation, dialysis, and storage in a
glycerol stock (10% volume/volume) at -80'C. The titer of each viral stock was routinely tested
to be 10111012 pfu by plaque forming assay using AD293 cells.
         PreparationofshRNA lentiviral vectors. SureSilencingTM shRNA Plasmid for Human
S100A8, S100A9 and CD33 and negative control (non-target) were purchased from
SABiosciences. 293T cells were transfected using transfection reagent (SABiosciences,)
according to manufacturer's instructions. Following 6 hours of incubation, the transfection
reagent was removed and replaced with fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum. Virus containing medium was collected 24-48hr later. Plasmids, pcDNA3 wild-type
DAP12 and P23-DAP12 were cut with HindIII and XhoI (Promega), and DNA Polymerase I
Large (Klenowl) (New England Biolabs Inc.) was used to fill in recessed 3' ends of DNA
fragments. pWPI, which contains a GFP expression cassette (Addgene Organization), was
digested using PMEI (New England Biolabs Inc.). After cutting DNA and vector, pWPI were
purified by Strata Prep PCR purification kit (Qiagen), DNAs were ligated (Takara DNA ligation
kit, Fisher) into vector pWPI and STBL2 competent cells were transformed (Invitrogen). 293T
cells were transfected with pWPI lentivirus vector, the packaging plasmid, psPAX2, and the
envelope plasmid, pMD2.G (Addgene Organization) using the Lipofectemine-2000 (Invitrogen)
at a ratio of 4:3:1 according to standard protocols. Following 6 hours of incubation, the
transfection reagent was removed and replaced with fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum. Virus containing medium was collected 24-48hr later. Cell infection was
performed as described above. Four days after the first infection, transduced cells were isolated
by FACS sorting GFP* cells with >99% purity.
         Infection ofMDSCfrom MDSpatients. MDSCs isolated from MDS patients were
infected three times using virus-containing infection medium at 24 hr intervals in the presence of
8gg/ml polyberene. For each infection, cells were plated in 12-well dishes at 1 x 106 cells/well.
Four days after the first infection, cells were harvested and used for real time PCR, Western blot
analysis, flow cytometry, or colony formation assays.
         Flow cytometry. BM-MNCs were stained with appropriate specific conjugated antibodies
in PBS with 2% BSA buffer. For MDSC sorting, FITC anti-CD3 and FITC anti-HLA-DR were
used as positive controls and isotype IgG were used for negative control and to detect non
specific staining. Cells were gently mixed and incubated for 30 min at 4 0C in the dark. Samples

    WO 2015/003149                                                          PCT/US2014/045444
were washed with PBS and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min. For cells used in phenotypic analysis
only, 0.5 ml of 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS was added prior to analysis.
         Cells were washed in PBS and then stained with PE-conjugated mAbs specific to CD40,
CD80, CD83, CD86, CCR7, CD1Ic, CD 14, HLA-DR, TLR2, or TLR4 and relevant isotype
controls (eBioscience) for 30 min in the dark, on ice. The cells were then washed with PBS
containing 0.5% BSA. Live cells were gated based on negative staining for 7-AAD. Samples
were acquired on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and the analysis was performed using Flowjo
6.3.4 software.
        Arginase activity. Arginase activity was measured in cell lysates as previously described
(Youn, J.I., et al. 2008. J Immunol 181:5791-5802). In brief, cells were lysed for 30 min with
 100 gl of 0.10%Triton X-100. Subsequently, 100 gl of 25 mM Tris-HCl and 10 gl of 10 mM
MnCl 2 were added, and the enzyme was activated by heating for 10 min at 56'C. Arginine
hydrolysis was conducted by incubating the lysate with 100 gl of 0.5 M L-arginine (pH 9.7) at
37 'C for 120 min. The reaction was stopped with 900 gl of H 2 SO 4 (96%)/H 3PO 4 (85%)/H 2 0
(1/3/7, v/v/v). Urea concentration was measured at 540 nm after addition of 40 gl of a
isonitrosopropiophenone (dissolved in 100% ethanol), followed by heating at 95 'C for 30 min.
        NO production. Equal volumes of culture supernatants (100 [l) were mixed with Greiss
reagent solution (1% sulfanilamide in 50%phosphoric acid and 0.10%N-1
naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride) in double-distilled water and incubated for 10 min at
room temperature. Absorbance of the mixture was measured at 550nm using a microplate plate
reader (Bio-Rad). Nitrite concentrations were determined by comparing the absorbance values
for the test samples to a standard curve generated by serial dilution of 0.25 mM sodium nitrite.
         Western Blot analysis. Cell lysates were prepared by resuspending cell pellet in 1% NP
40, 10 mM Tris, 140 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM PMSF, 10 mM iodoacetamide, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.4 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1Ogg/ml leupeptin, 10 gg/ml pepsatin, and 1Ogg/ml
aprotinin and lysing on ice for 30 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min to
remove nuclei and cell debris. The protein concentration of the soluble extracts was determined
by using the Bio-Rad (Bradford) protein assay. 50 gg of protein (per lane) was separated on a
 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel by electrophoresis then transferred to a PVDF membrane.
Membranes were probed for indicated antibody: anti-Si 00A8 or anti-Si 00A9 (MRP8 or
calgranulin A and anti-MRP14 or calgranulin B respectively, Santa Cruz); anti-S 100A8/A9
(Santa Cruz); anti-phospho Erk, anti- total Erk, anti-phospho Syk, and anti- total Syk (Cell
Signaling). Proteins were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system

(ECL, Amersham). Lysate from Si 00A9 un-transfected, empty vector and Si 00A9 transfect
SJCRH30 or AD293 cells was serially-diluted (as indicated in the figure) with the first lysate,
starting at 50 ptg, followed by loading onto a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked overnight at
40 C in 5% milk. Following incubation with CD33-fusion for 2 hours at room temperature, and
staining with an anti-human IgG HRP-conjugated secondary, the membrane was washed and
used for radiograph analysis to demonstrated specific S100A9 binding to CD33. The membrane
was afterwards used for Coomassie blue staining to show the relative equal loading of proteins
on each dot in the nitrocellulose membrane.
        Complete peripheralblood cell counts (CBC). CBC was performed by animal core
laboratory pathological personnel in the vivarium at the Moffitt Cancer Center. The mouse blood
parameters were determined as described in Table 1 with a Heska Hematrue Hematology
Analyzer.
        Pathologicalexamination of spleen and BM biopsy from wt and S10OA9Tg mice. Bone
marrow cells were obtained from bilateral tibiae and femura from 6 month old S1 0OA9Tg and wt
control mice as previously described (Xu, S., et al. 2010. J Biomed Biotechnol 2010:105940).
Touch prints of murine splenocytes were prepared as described (Ioachim, H.L., et al. 2008.
Iochim's lymph node pathology. Chapter 3. cytopathology. Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams
&Wilkins. :p 21-22). Bone marrow aspirates and touch-imprints were stained using Wright
Giemsa stain. Sections of bone marrow and spleen were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered neutral
formalin, decalcified (only applied to bone marrow) and embedded in paraffin by routine
procedures. Sections were cut at 4 [tm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and
periodic acid Schiff (PAS). The presence of myelodysplastic features characteristic of MDS was
evaluated by experienced hematopathologist. BM core biopsy shows 50% cellularity with
maturing trilineage hematopoiesis (H&E, 200x). Figure 5E shows a high power view of the BM
biopsy that demonstrates normal appearing megakaryocytes with normal lobation. Mixed
myeloid and erythroid precursors are normally distributed with estimated M:E ratio of 2:1 (H&E,
600x). Wright-Giemsa stained BM aspirate exhibits full maturation in all three lineages without
dysplastic features (Wright-Giemsa, 1000x). Inlet shows a normal lobated megakaryocyte
(Figure 5F). Touch imprint of mouse spleen displays predominance of small and mature
appearing lymphocytes intermingled with occasional erythropoietic precursors (Wright-Giemsa,
1000 x) (Figure 5G). BM core biopsy reveals hypercellularity, approximately 95% with
increased megakaryocytes, especially in small forms (H&E, 200x) (Figure 5H). High power
magnification highlights dysplastic megakaryocytes with single or hypolobated, or disjointed

nuclei and markedly increased in number (H&E, 600x) (insert) (Figure 51). Inlet includes two
markedly dysplastic micromegakaryocytes with hypolobation. BM aspirates exhibits mildly
increased blasts admixed with myeloid and erythroid precursors. The latter demonstrates slightly
irregular nuclear contour and minimal megaloblastoid changes (Wright-Giemsa, 1000x) (Figure
5J). Inlet contains two blasts showing delicate or fine chromatin, prominent nucleoli, high N:C
ratio, and scant basophilic cytoplasm. Touch preparation of transgenic mouse spleen show
increased erythroid precursors; some of them displaying enlarged size with abnormal nuclearity
and occasional nuclear bridge (Wright-Giemsa, 1000x) (Figure 5K).
         Statistics. All data was presented as means ± SEM. Statistical calculations were
performed with Microsoft Excel or GraphPad Prism analysis tools. Differences between
individual groups were analyzed by paired t-test. P values of <0.05 were considered to be
statistically significant.
         Results
         Lin-HLA-DR-CD33+MDSC are expanded in MDS primaryBMspecimens and direct
suppression ofautologous erythroidprecursors. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC)
were isolated from MDS BM aspirates (n=12), age-matched healthy BM (n=8), or non-MDS
cancer patients (4 breast and 4 lymphoma) and analyzed for the presence of LIN-HLA-DR
CD33+ MDSCs by flow cytometry. MDS patients exhibited markedly higher numbers of
MDSCs (median 35.5%, P<0.0001) compared to healthy donors or non-MDS cancer patients
(less than 5%, Figure 1A). To determine if MDS-MDSCs are derived from the malignant MDS
clone, LIN-HLA-DR-CD33+ MDSCs were sorted from MDS specimens with chromosome 5q
[del(5q)] or 7q [del(7q)] deletion and analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with
specific probes.
         Cytogenetically abnormal cells harboring del(5q) or del(7q) were restricted to the non
MDSC population, whereas LIN-HLA-DR-CD33+ MDSCs displayed a corresponding normal
chromosome complement (Figure IB). Exome sequencing studies have shown that clonal
somatic gene mutations are demonstrable in the vast majority of MDS specimens lacking
chromosome abnormalities by metaphase karyotyping. To further evaluate the relationship
between MDSC and the MDS clone, a QPCR array of the most common gene mutations in MDS
(Qiagen) was performed in purified MDSC and non-MDSC populations from primary bone
marrow MDS specimens. Mutations involving CBL, EZH2, IDH1/2, N-RAS, SRSF2, U2A535
and RUNX1 genes were detected in the MDS specimens, however, all mutations were restricted

these findings, MDSCs were depleted from MDS BM specimens prior to anti-CD3/anti-CD28
stimulation and then the MDSC were added back to the control group. MDSC-depletion
significantly improved T cell responses compared to the MDSC-supplemented group (Figure
 1E), thereby linking the observed impaired T cell responsiveness to the actions of BM-derived
MDSCs. In addition, suppressive MDS-MDSC overproduced suppressive cytokines such as IL
 10 and TGF-P (Figure IF & G), as well as nitric oxide (NO) and arginase compared to MDSCs
isolated from healthy donors (Figure 1H & I). Collectively, these data demonstrate that LIN
HLA-DR-CD33* MDSC are a unique and functional cellular subset supporting a pro
inflammatory microenvironment and immune tolerance in the BM of MDS patients.
         MDSC-mediated suppressive and cytotoxic effector functions require direct contact with
target cells. One mechanism utilized by cytotoxic effectors is the mobilization of pore-forming
granules and the release of caspase-activating effector proteases, such as granzyme B, to the site
of effector:target contact thereby inducing apoptosis of the target cell (Chen, X., et al. 2008.
Blood 113(14):3226-34). Since MDSC reside in close proximity with hematopoietic progenitor
cells (HPCs) that in MDS display an increased apoptotic rate, MDSC-mediated cytostatic
activity may contribute to HPC death. To address this, MDS-MDSC granule mobilization and
release of granzyme B were examined using four-color immunofluorescence staining. MDS
MDSCs exhibited strong granzyme B polarization at the site of cell contact with CD235a*
(glycophorin A)/CD71- autologous erythroid precursors (Figure 1J). After 30 minutes
incubation, the frequency of such effector-target conjugates in MDS patient specimens was
significantly higher (34%) than in samples from healthy donors (5% P<0.001, Figure 1K & L).
These cellular interactions resulted in apoptosis of targeted erythroid precursors (Figure IM)
demonstrating that in addition to known MDSC-mediated immune suppressive functions, there
is an unrecognized MDSC-mediated hematopoietic suppressive capacity. To corroborate this
finding, the effects of MDSC on the proliferative capacity of HPCs were examined in MDS
MDSC-depleted, HSPC enriched, BM patient specimens in a methylcellulose colony formation
assay. Burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage
(CFU-GM) colony formation was significantly higher in MDSC-depleted specimens compared

to both MDSC-supplemented and unsorted samples (Figure IN), demonstrating that MDSC have
a direct suppressive role on erythroid and myeloid progenitor cell development.
         IncreasedCD33 expression and signaling contribute to MDSC suppressivefunctions and
hematopoietic impairment.MDSCs in humans characteristically express the surface
transmembrane glycoprotein CD33, a Siglec 3 receptor that along with other members of this
family, have prominent roles in inflammation (Crocker, P.R., et al. 2007. Nat Rev Immunol

279:43117-43125). However, the involvement of CD33 in myelopoiesis remains unexplored.
Hence, the relationship between CD33 membrane expression density on MDS-MDSC and their
activation and maintenance in MDS BM was investigated. These cells were found to robustly
express CD33 at levels higher than LIN-HLA-DRCD33 cells isolated from non-MDS
associated cancer patients and healthy donor BM cells (Figure 2A). To explore the functional
consequences of CD33 engagement, CD33 was cross-linked in U937 cells (a human monocytic
cell line with high CD33 expression), which triggered IL-10, TGF-P and VEGF secretion (Figure
2B). To examine whether CD33 can promote MDSC accumulation and/or activation, CD33 was
overexpressed with an adenovirus vector in BM-MNC from healthy donors, which significantly
suppressed myeloid cell development as evidenced by reduced expression of the maturation
markers CD1 Ic, CD80, and CCR7 (Figure 2C). To further establish the role of CD33 in MDSC
mediated BM suppression, CD33 was knocked down in MDS-MDSC using a lentiviral vector
(LV) containing CD33-specific-shRNA. Co-culture of autologous HPCs with CD33 shRNA
treated MDS-MDSCs resulted in a 2-3 fold increase in BFU-E and CFU-GM colony recovery
compared to those cultured with scrambled shRNA-treated and non-transduced MDS-MDSCs
and healthy donor BM MDSCs (Figure 2D). Moreover, production of IL-10, TGF-P, and
arginase was reduced in CD33 shRNA-treated MDS-MDSC compared to control cells (Figure
2E, F, G). Collectively, these data delineate a role for CD33 in MDSC activation and expansion
in MDS and directing hematopoietic impairment.
         SJOOA9 is a native ligandfor CD33. Although these investigations showed that
CD33/Siglec 3 is a key receptor involved in functional activation of MDSC, its native ligand was
unknown. Therefore, to identify potential ligand(s) for this receptor, a chimeric fusion protein

    WO 2015/003149                                                         PCT/US2014/045444
with the ectodomain of CD33 and the Fe portion of human IgG (here on referred to as CD33
fusion) was produced. BM cell lysates from MDS patients were immunoprecipitated with the
CD33-fusion followed by high throughput mass-spectrometric analysis on associated peptides.
S100A9, an inflammatory signaling molecule known to activate MDSC, was among the most
prominent protein bands identified (Figure 3A). To confirm the specificity of the binding of this
DAMP to CD33 both S100A8 and S100A9 transfectants were prepared in the
rhabdomyosarcoma cell line SJCRH30, which lacks detectable expression of endogenous CD33,
S100A8 or S100A9. The CD33-fusion (APC) stained only S100A9 transfected cells, but not
S100A8 transfected cells, confirming binding specificity (Figure 3B. Transfectants were stained
with FITC and specific binding by the CD33-fusion was stained with APC, (nuclei were stained
with DAPI). Direct binding of S100A9 to CD33 was confirmed further in a sandwich ELISA
where the capture antibody was anti-S 100A9 (Figure 3C) as well as by dot blot analysis of
transfected cell lysates with CD33-fusion (Figure 3D), demonstrating the specificity of the
interaction. To fully corroborate the binding of this pair, a reverse immune-precipitation was
performed on CD33 transfected cells showing that S100A9 co-precipitated with CD33 only in
S100A9 co-transfected cells (Figure 3E). To validate clinically the ligand specificity in MDS
patients, the pull-down was compared with CD33-fusion from healthy PBMC and BM as well as
MDS patients. As expected, the highest amount of S1 00A9 was precipitated from the BM of
MDS patient specimens (Figure 3F). Next, to understand the kinetics of S1 00A9 and CD33
interactions, SJCRH30 cells were transfected with either vector or CD33 and incubated with
recombinant human (rh) S1 00A9 tagged with DDK (DYKDDDDK epitope, same epitope as
Flag). This resulted in a time-dependent increase in binding of rhS1OOA9 to stable SJCRH30
CD33 cells but no binding to vector transfected cells (Figure 3G). To demonstrate the
functionality of this ligation pair, rhS10OA9 was added to SJCRH30-CD33 cells which triggered
CD33 mediated up-regulation of ILI 0 and TGFP expression (Figure 3H and I). To confirm that
rhS1OOA9 can recapitulate these observation of the secretion of these cytokines after cross
linking CD33, the experiments were repeated in U937 cells with rhS1OOA9 and an increase in
production of both cytokines was again found (Figure 3J and K). Importantly, BM plasma
concentration of S100A9 was significantly increased in MDS patients compared to BM plasma
from healthy donors (Figure 3L). Moreover, the engagement of CD33 with rhSiOOA9 in MDS
MDSC from patient BM resulted in a time-dependent co-localization of this ligand/receptor pair
in primary MDS-BM cells (Figure 3M). It is well recognized that CD33 signals through
phosphorylation of ITIMs that recruit SHP- 1 (Src homology region 2 domain-containing
                                                 48

phosphatase- 1). rhS 100A9 ligation correspondingly increased the recruitment of SHP- 1
confirming that CD33 signals through its ITIM after S100A9 ligation in MDS-BM (Figure 3N).
In addition, directly treating CD33-transfected SJCRH30 with the BM plasma of MDS patients
triggered the recruitment of SHP- 1 to ITIM when compared to cells treated with the plasma of
healthy donors, suggesting that increased secretion of Si 00A9 in the local BM
microenvironment may have a role in the activation of CD33-ITIM signaling (Figure 30).
        S1 OOA 8/Si 00A9 engagement of CD33 triggersMDS-MDSC activation. Having
established S100A9 and CD33 as a functional ligand/receptor pair, the role of this interaction in
replicating the functional responses observed with receptor crosslinking was explored. CD33
overexpression was again induced in healthy BM cells through adenovirus transfection and their
immunesuppressive properties with or without the addition of rhS 1 00A9 was studied. Forced
expression of CD33 induced a parallel increase in gene expression and secretion of the
suppressive cytokines, IL-10 and TGFP (light grey bars, Figure 4A-D), which was greatly
increased by the addition of rhSO0OA9 (black bars). Secretion of the suppressive cytokine TGFP
was only observed after rhS10OA9 treatment of CD33 transfected cells (Figure 4D),
accompanied by an increase in the expression of NOS2 and ARG2, consistent with the
suppressive cytokine profile (Figure 4E and F). Figure 4G-H demonstrates the transfection
efficiency of the CD33 adenovirus at both the gene and protein expression level measured by
QPCR and GFP by flow cytometry, respectively.
         To further delineate the specific role of S100A9's ligation with CD33 compared to its
other ligands, RAGE, TLR4, CD33 as well as each pair were blocked with antibodies before
treating healthy BM cells with rhS1OOA9. These data show that blockade of CD33 reduced both
IL-10 and TGFP production, while treatment with anti-RAGE and anti-TLR4 had no significant
effects on IL-10 production but displayed modest suppression of TGFP secretion and expression
(Figure 41 and J). These findings suggest that although CD33 plays a critical role in the secretion
of both cytokines, other receptors associated with local bone marrow inflammation may also
have a contribution. To confirm that S1 00A9 expression contributes to inflammation in the BM
microenvironment, S1 00A8 and S1 00A9 were knocked down in MDS-MDSC using gene
specific shRNAs (Figure 4K). Given that S1 00A9 usually pairs with S1 00A8 as a heterodimer
and are concomitantly regulated, it was not surprising that there was reciprocal changes in gene
expression with down-regulation in expression of the alternate protein. Importantly, reduction of
S1 00A8/S 100A9 expression profoundly attenuated IL- 10 and TGF-P production (Figure 4L and
M) and rescued autologous BFU-E and CFU-GM colony formation (Figure 4N). These data
                                                   49

    WO 2015/003149                                                         PCT/US2014/045444
show that inflammation-associated Si 00A8/S 100A9 signaling plays a critical role in the
activation of MDS-MDSC and suppress normal hematopoiesis.
        SJOOA9 transgenic mice recapitulatefeatures of human MDS. Given the findings that
S100A8/S100A9 triggers CD33/Siglec 3 signaling and is involved in MDSC activation
(Ehrchen, J.M., et al. 2009. J Leukoc Biol 86:557-566; Vogl, T., et al. 2007. Nat Med 13:1042
 1049; Cheng, P., et al. 2008. J Exp Med 205:2235-2249), S100A9 transgenic mice (S100A9Tg)
were generated to study MDSC-associated inflammation (Cheng, P., et al. 2008. J Exp Med
205:2235-2249). Since MDS is an age-associated disease, changes in the proportion of BM
MDSC (Gr1KCD11b- cells) with age were analyzed in S100A9Tg compared to S100A9
knockout (S100A9KO)(Manitz, M.P., et al. 2003. Mol Cell Biol 23:1034-1043) or wild-type
(WT) mice at 6, 18 or 24 weeks of age. This resulted in a marked age-dependent accumulation of
MDSC in the BM of S100A9Tg mice, but not in S100A9KO or WT mice, that reached its
maximum by 24 weeks (Figure 5A). Similarly, the proportion of MDSC in PBMC and spleen
also increased with age (Figure 5B). Although changes in the proportion of MDSC in the spleen
was comparatively less than in the BM, it was accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of
mature cells (Figure 5C and 5D), effectively increasing the ratio of immature to mature cells in
this hematopoietic organ. Functionally, only the MDSC from 24-week old S100A9Tg mice, but
not S1 0OA9KO or WT mice, significantly inhibited BFU-E (Figure 5E) and CFU-GM
formation, which was rescued after depletion of MDSC in the S100A9Tg group (Figure 5E).
Importantly, as further evidence of the role of S1 00A9 as an essential inflammatory factor
regulating MDSC expansion and suppressive activity, IL-10 and TGF-P secretion was
significantly increased in S100A9Tg mice compared to KO or wild-type animals (Figure 5F).
        To evaluate the in vivo consequences of S1 00A9 over-expression on hematopoiesis,
serial complete blood counts (CBC) were analyzed from WT and S1 0OA9Tg mice at 6, 18 and
24 weeks of age. S100A9Tg mice developed progressive multilineage cytopenias characterized
by decreasing hemoglobin (Hgb), red blood cell (RBC) number, neutrophil and platelet counts
evident as early as 6 weeks of age. By 18 weeks, S1 0OA9Tg mice exhibited severe anemia and
thrombocytopenia with a greater than 22.0% decrease in RBC, 20.10% decrease in Hgb, and
77.8% decrease in platelets (Table 2). Histological examination of BM aspirates and biopsy
sections from WT mice displayed normal morphology and cytological features (Figure 5G-J). In
contrast, the BM of S1 0OA9Tg mice was hyper-cellular (95% cellularity) accompanied by tri
lineage cytological dysplasia (Figure 5K-N). Megakaryocyte morphology recapitulated the
dysplastic features characteristic of human MDS, with a preponderance of mononuclear or
                                                 50

hypolobated forms. Erythroid precursors displayed megaloblastoid maturation with abnormal
hemoglobination and occasional binucleation. Nuclear budding and bizarre mitotic forms were
also apparent (Figure 5K-N). Cytopenias worsened with age and by 24 weeks S10OA9Tg mice
developed severe pan-cytopenia (detailed descriptions summarized in the figure legend).
Although this model closely replicates the inflammatory milieu observed in human MDS, HSPC
from Si 0OA9Tg mice also express the Si 00A9 protein. Given that the provenance of this protein
in human MDS is not known, cellular expression of S1 00A9 in MDS BM-MNC was
investigated by flow cytometry. S100A9 intracellular staining was detected in CD33- cells,
whereas CD34* HSCs had no demonstrable S100A9 expression (Figure 50 and 5P). S100A9
expression was not detected in other immune cells such as CD3 lymphocytes, CD19_ B cells or
CD56* NK cells.

         Analysis of the role ofMDSC by adoptive transferof enrichedHSCfrom SJ0OA9Tg mice.
To more accurately delineate the role of MDSC from S1 0OA9Tg mice in hematopoiesis,
competitive adoptive transfer was performed of enriched HSCs into lethally irradiated (900cGy)
female FVB/NJ mice with age-matched WT HSC, S1 0OA9Tg HSC or an admixture (1:1 ratio) of
enriched BM HSCs from male mice. Using a male to female SRY gene expression PCR
approach to monitor engraftment, all mice experienced greater than 80% engraftment (Figure 8).
After engraftment (defined as WBC >3x10 3 cells/uL in WT recipients at 8 weeks), recipients of
WT HSC had proportions of both BM derived Gr1KCdl 1b- and HSCs (Figure 6A and C) that
were comparable to levels in un-transplanted WT mice (Figure 5A). In contrast, adoptive
transfer with S1 0OA9Tg enriched HSCs generated a high proportion of GFP expressing
                                                       51

    WO 2015/003149                                                         PCT/US2014/045444
Gr1KCd1l1b MDSCs (Figure 6B) accompanied by a reduced proportion of HSCs, findings
analogous to our observations in older transgenic mice (Figure 6C). However, mice that received
the admixed HSC population had a proportion of MDSCs approaching that in WT adoptively
transferred mice (~30%). Notably, nearly 50% of MDSCs lacked GFP expression, indicating
origination from WT HSPCs (Figure 6B), whereas the remaining GFP* MDSC derived from
S100A9Tg donor cells. Although the total MDSC population did not increase to the level
observed in the Si 0OA9Tg adoptively transferred mice, a decreased proportion of HSCs to levels
found in mice transplanted with S100A9Tg donor cells was observed (Figure 6C). These
findings indicate that the smaller population of activated MDSCs from S1 0OA9Tg donor cells
had sufficient suppressive activity to yield a comparable impairment of hematopoietic integrity.
These findings were supported by sequential analyses of peripheral blood counts in which mixed
source transplant recipients had cytopenias that were intermediate in severity relative to those in
mice receiving the S1 0OA9Tg or WT donor cells (Figure 6D, E, F). Interestingly, while mixed
donor recipients had the same proportion of HSCs after engraftment as Tg transplanted mice,
their WBC counts were higher than mice transplanted with S1 0OA9Tg HSC and lower than
levels in WT HSC recipients. Similarly, onset of anemia was delayed in recipients of the mixed
versus S100A9Tg donor cells. These findings suggest that normal HSC from WT mice are able
to partially rescue hematopoiesis, but with time hematopoiesis is suppressed by accumulating
MDSC derived from S100A9Tg donor cells.
        To address whether S100A9 alone has direct effects on HSCs, BM CD34+ (MDSC
depleted, MDSC-) from MDS patient specimens were treated with rhS 100A9 for 24 and 48
hours and assessed apoptosis by flow cytometry. A decrease in the number of CD34* HSPCs
was observed after treatment compared to controls accompanied by a corresponding increase in
the apoptotic fraction among surviving cells after 48 hours exposure (Figure 6G and H). In order
to corroborate these findings, healthy bone marrow-derived CD34* cells (Lonza, Wakerfield)
were cultured with rhS 100A9 and a decrease in viable cells was again observed after treatment
(50.7% viability in control cells versus 24.7% in rhS 100A9 treated cells, Figure 61). These
findings suggest that S100A9 has a direct apoptotic effect in human HSCs.
        Forcedmaturation ofMDSC restores hematopoiesis. To confirm the effector role of
MDSC and investigate the potential benefit of targeted suppression of MDSC, S100A9Tg mice
were treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). ATRA induces MDSC differentiation into
mature myeloid cells and neutralizes ROS production, thereby extinguishing MDSC through
forced terminal differentiation (Nefedova, Y., et al. 2007. Cancer Res 67:11021-11028; Mirza,
                                                 52

    WO 2015/003149                                                         PCT/US2014/045444
N., et al. 2006. Cancer Res 66:9299-9307). To this end, it was examined whether ATRA would
induce MDSC differentiation in Si 0OA9Tg mice and improve hematopoiesis. Si 0OA9Tg and
WT mice were treated with ATRA (250ptg/200ptl) or vehicle control orally for five consecutive
days. Two days after completion of the treatment, ATRA reduced the total number of MDSC
while numbers in WT mice remained at basal levels (Figure 7A). Reductions in MDSC number
in S1 0OA9Tg mice were coupled to an increase in mature cells following ATRA treatment
(Figure 7B). Treatment of primary MDS BM specimens with ATRA also reduced in vitro
MDSC accumulation. Importantly, BM progenitor cultures from ATRA-treated S100A9Tg mice
showed significantly improved BFU-E recovery compared to vehicle-treated controls (Figure
7C). Analysis of changes in peripheral blood counts showed that RBC, WBC and platelet counts
significantly increased compared to vehicle treated controls (Figure 7D), indicating that terminal
differentiation of MDSCs can restore effective hematopoiesis.
         Investigations showed that MDSC employ CD33-associated ITIMs to inhibit their own
cellular maturation (Figure 3N and 0). However, ITIM signals can be over-ridden by stimulatory
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-mediated signals (Lanier, L.L. 2005.
Annu Rev Immunol 23:225-274; Ravetch, J.V., et al. 2000. Science 290:84-89). Some CD33
related receptors, such as certain Siglecs, lack ITIMs and instead function as activating receptors.
Mouse Siglec-H and human Siglec-14 have been shown to interact with DAP12 (Blasius, A.L.,
et al. 2006. Blood 107:2474-2476; Blasius, A.L., et al. 2006. Trends Immunol 27:255-260;
Angata, T., et al. 2006. Faseb J 20:1964-1973; Lanier, L.L., et al. 1998. Nature 391:703-707), an
ITAM-containing adaptor that can promote myeloid cell maturation (Figure 9) and inhibit TLR-4
activation (Turnbull, I.R., et al. 2007. Nat Rev Immunol 7:155-161). Rhe DAP12 gene
expression of purified MDS-MDSC (n=5) was compared to age-matched healthy donor MDSC
(n=5). DAP12 mRNA was significantly lower in MDS-MDSC in all specimens tested (Figure
7E). It was reasoned that overriding CD33-ITIM signaling via DAP12 would induce the
differentiation of these immature myeloid cells and improve hematopoiesis. To test this, a
constitutively active form of DAP 12, named P23, was created and AD293 cells transfected with
either GFP, WT-DAP12, or active-DAP12 P23 viral vectors. The results show that P23 binds
Syk kinase and activates downstream signaling in transduced AD293 cells without external
stimulation (Figure 7F). Furthermore, P23 promotes primary human DC maturation as
demonstrated by up-regulation of CD80, CD83, and CCR7 antigens (Figure 10) (Blasius, A.L.,
et al. 2006. Blood 107:2474-2476; Blasius, A.L., et al. 2006. Trends Immunol 27:255-260).
Based on these findings, it is possible that P23 could induce the maturation of MDS-MDSC and
                                                  53

    WO 2015/003149                                                         PCT/US2014/045444
thereby prevent or disrupt hematopoietic suppression. To test this, expression of the human
monocytic and granulocytic surface markers CD 14 and CD 15 were analyzed after transfection
(Araki, H., et al. 2004. Blood 103:2973-2980) and results showed that while WT-DAP12
transfection alone was sufficient to induce up-regulation of CD 14 and CD 15, P23 transfection
induced even greater expression of both maturation markers (Figure 7G). Moreover, P23
promoted the maturation of primary MDS-MDSC as demonstrated by up-regulation of CD80,
CD83, and CCR7 maturation markers (Figure 7H). Lastly, to test whether DAP12-mediated
MDSC maturation relieved suppression of erythropoiesis, MDS-MDSC were purified from
seven MDS patients and infected with control, WT-DAP12 or P23 lentiviral constructs. To
assess the suppressive function of the mature MDS-MDSCs on hematopoiesis, colony forming
capacity was assessed after culture of infected cells with autologous, MDSC-depleted BM cells.
P23-infected MDS-MDSC co-cultures yielded significantly higher colony numbers than control
viral vector or WT-DAP12-infected MDS-MDSC co-cultures (Figure 71). These findings
indicate that DAP12 overrides CD33-associated ITIM signaling to stimulate MDSC maturation,
and reverse the suppressive effects on HPC colony forming capacity.
        Discussion
        Inflammatory stimuli within the BM microenvironment are recognized as important
biological signals stimulating progenitor cell proliferation and apoptosis in MDS. A recent
population-based study extended this further by demonstrating a strong linkage between chronic
immune stimulation and MDS predisposition (Kristinsson, S.Y., et al. 2011. J Clin Oncol
29:2897-2903). Definitive evidence that niche intrinsic abnormalities per se can alone account
for development of MDS in a cell non-autonomous fashion are limited. Raaijmakers and
colleagues showed that selective osteo-progenitor dysfunction caused by deletion of Dicer1 in
the mesenchymal component of the BM microenvironment was sufficient to perturb
hematopoiesis and lead to development of myeloid dysplasia, followed by secondary emergence
of myeloid-restricted genetic abnormalities (Raaijmakers, M.H., et al. 2010. Nature 464:852
857).
        The disclosed studies show that Lin-HLA-DR-CD33 MDSC accumulate in the BM of
MDS patients, derive from a population that is distinct from the neoplastic clone, and serve as
cellular effectors that suppress hematopoiesis, promote T cell tolerance and serve as a key source
of myelosuppressive and inflammatory molecules such as IL-10, TGF-P, NO, and arginase.
Using multiple biological and biochemical approaches, it was shown that Si 00A9, also known
as migration inhibitory factor-related protein 14 (MRP- 14) or calgranulin-B, can serve as an
                                                 54

    WO 2015/003149                                                           PCT/US2014/045444
endogenous native ligand for CD33/Siglec 3. Furthermore, forced expansion of MDSC by over
expression of the Si 00A9 in transgenic mice initiates development of hematologic features that
phenocopy human MDS, specifically progressive age-dependent ineffective and dysplastic
hematopoiesis. These findings indicate that expansion of a single cellular constituent of the BM
microenvironment is sufficient to foster neoplastic change in heterologous myeloid progenitors
through niche-conducive oncogenesis. The time dependent accumulation of MDSC in the
transgenic mouse model parallels recent human findings that MDSCs expand with age
accompanied by rising serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-a, IL-6, and IL
 1 ), providing evidence that such senescence dependent changes driving MDSC expansion may
play an important role in the age dependent pathogenesis of MDS (Verschoor CP, et al. 2013. J
Leukoc Biol 93(4):633-7). Importantly, the LIN-HLA-DRCD33 phenotype did not alone confer
suppressor cell function, as evidenced by lack of LIN-HLA-DR-CD33          MDSC suppression from
age-matched healthy donors or non-MDS cancer patients. The disclosed studies demonstrate the
necessity for activation of innate immune signaling and generation of pro-inflammatory
molecules, such as S1 00A9, for the induction of MDS-MDSC-mediated suppressor function.
Furthermore, the disclosed finding that primary human MDS-MDSC lack molecular genetic
abnormalities intrinsic to the malignant clone indicate that MDSC derive from non-neoplastic
HSC, and that MDSC activation and expansion likely precedes emergence of genetically distinct
MDS clones.
         CD33, a Siglec receptor expressed by many immune cells including MDSC, is shown
herein to be markedly over-expressed by MDS-MDSC, and this receptor is shown to control the
suppressive functions of MDS-MDSC through disruption of ITIM-mediated signaling.
Additionally, the disclosed findings that rhS1OOA9 directly triggers apoptosis in human HPCs,
indicates that this ligand exerts dual roles in the promotion of ineffective hematopoiesis that
involve both cellular (MDSC) and humoral mechanisms (CD33, TLR4). Moreover, cellular
response to CD33 ligand engagement appears cell type specific, i.e., apoptosis in HPC versus
activation and proliferation in MDSC. Compensatory regeneration within the myeloid
compartment could account for the increased proliferative index observed in MDS (Raza et. al.
 1995. Blood 86(1):268-276) and preferential myeloid skewing that occurs with age. Over
expression of CD33 may therefore impair maturation signals from ITAM associated receptors
that is critical to expansion of immature MDSC (Figure 7G and H). Consistent with this, shRNA
silencing of CD33 reduced myelosuppressive cytokine elaboration, and importantly, restored
hematopoietic progenitor colony forming capacity. Moreover, constitutively active DAP12
                                                   55

    WO 2015/003149                                                        PCT/US2014/045444
signaling was sufficient to override CD33-ITIM inhibition and induce MDSC differentiation,
which restored erythropoiesis upon active-DAP12 transfection into MDS-MDSC. More
importantly, DAP12 activation can inhibit TLR-mediated signaling pathways, which may also
play a role in the inflammation-mediated BM suppression (Turnbull, I.R., et al. 2007. Nat Rev
Immunol 7:155-161; Hamerman, J.A., et al. 2006. J Immunol 177:2051-2055).
         Mounting evidence implicates activation of innate immune signaling in the pathogenesis
and biologic features of human MDS (Hofmann, W.K., et al. 2002. Blood 100:3553-3560;
Gondek, L.P., et al. 2008. Blood 111:1534-1542; Starczynowski, D.T., et al. 2008. Blood
 112:3412-3424). In del(5q) MDS, allelic deletion of miR-145 and miR-146a results in de
repression of the respective targets, TIRAP and TRAF6. Of particular importance, Starcznowski
and colleagues showed that knockdown of these specific miRs or over-expression of TRAF6 in
murine HSPC recapitulated hematologic features of del(5q) MDS in a transplant model through
both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms involving interleukin-6 (Starczynowski,
D.T., et al. 2010 Nat Med 16:49-58; Starczynowski, D.T., et al. 2010. Hematol Oncol Clin North
Am 24:343-359). The disclosed studies show that the heterodimeric DAMP S100A8/S100A9,
specifically released at BM inflammatory sites, is not only aberrantly expressed in MDS but
serves as a native ligand for CD33. This finding provides evidence that S100 proteins contribute
directly to MDS pathogenesis through microenvironment-directed, cell non-autonomous
mechanisms involving MDSC (Ehrchen, J.M., et al. 2009. J Leukoc Biol 86:557-566; Viemann,
D., et al. 2007. Blood 109:2453-2460). Moreover, TLR activation suppresses osteoblast
differentiation, while instructing myeloid commitment in HSC (Bandow, K., et al. 2010.
Biochem Biophys Res Commun 402:755-761; De Luca, K., et al. 2009. Leukemia 23:2063
2074). Prolonged activation of innate immune signaling with age, therefore, may disrupt the BM
endosteal niche supporting maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells, and favor translocation of
myeloid progenitors to an angiogenic niche characteristic of MDS (Bellamy, W.T., et al. 2001.
Blood 97:1427-1434). This is supported by the disclosed findings of age dependent development
of cytopenias with emergence of dysplastic cytological features in the Si 0OA9Tg mice. More
importantly, the competitive transplant experiments showed that admixture of S1 0OA9Tg with
WT donor HSCs delays, albeit with time still impairs hematopoiesis.
         The disclosed findings support a model for MDS pathogenesis in which sustained
activation of innate immune signaling in the BM microenvironment creates a permissive
inflammatory milieu that is sufficient for development of myelodysplasia. Cell autonomous
neoplastic hematopoietic progenitors may emerge following acquisition of secondary genetic
                                                 56

abnormalities in the myeloid compartment. Si 0OA9Tg mice simulate human MDS and can serve
as an in vivo model to study MDS pathogenesis and development of novel therapeutics.
Nevertheless, therapeutic interventions that promote MDSC maturation may have remitting
potential when applied early in the disease course.
