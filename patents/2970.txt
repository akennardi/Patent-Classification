Detailed Description
 [0039] Referring to Figures 1 to 17, there is shown a section 10 adapted to couple
with another like-configured section 10 with a joiner 12 so as to form an assembly 14
 such as a frame 16 or the like in a fitted condition. The section 10 and the joiner 12
may be formed of any suitable material such as metal or plastic.
 [0040] The section 10 includes an elongate body 15 having opposing ends 18,
 opposing front and back sides 19, 20, an inner side 22 that forms an inner perimeter
24 of the frame 16 and an opposing outer side 26 that forms an outer perimeter 28 of
the frame 16. Each section 10 includes a joining portion 17 toward the outer side 26
 for connection with the joiner 12 and an inner perimeter section 25 extending along
joining portion 17 for forming the inner perimeter 24 of the frame 16.
 [0041] It is noted that the shape of the section 10 may be varied and keeping only a
 common joiner 12 and a common joining portion 17. The inner perimeter section 25
may be varied to suit the application and other features may be added to the common
joining portion 17. Accordingly, the common joiner 12 and a common joining portion

                                            -6
 17 may be considered a universal joining system or assembly 100. For example, the
section 10 may be formed as one or more of a HD L Frame (as shown herein), an LD
L Frame, an LD Door Jamb, and an LD Z Frame that include the joining portion 17.
All variations are considered within the scope of section 10 herein.
[0042] The opposing front and back sides 19, 20 of the joining portion 17 include
respective opposing side walls 21, 29 and the outer side 26 includes an outer wall 27
that extends between the opposing side walls 21, 29. The inner side 22 includes an
inner sidewall 23 extending parallel to the outer wall 27 and between the opposing
side walls 21. The inner perimeter section 25 extends along the inner side wall 23 and
the internal perimeter section 25 may be narrower than the joining portion 17. The
inner perimeter section 25 includes an inner perimeter wall 31 and side walls 33, 35.
One of the side walls 33 is coextensive with one of the opposing sides 20 of joining
portion 17 and the other of the side wall 35 is set back from the opposing sides 20 of
the joining portion 17. The side wall 35 includes a channel 37 adapted to receive a
sealing strip or rubber seal (not shown).
[0043] Each of the opposing ends 18 includes a first outer aperture 30 toward the
outer side 26, a second aperture 32 for receiving the joiner 12 located inwardly of the
first aperture 30 toward the inner side 22 and an internal member 34 between the first
and second apertures 30, 32. The joiner 12 abuts the internal member 34 in the fitted
condition and is secured thereto as is further detailed below.
[0044] The first and second apertures 30, 32 provide first and second voids 36, 39 that
extend lengthwise along the elongate body 16 with the internal member 34 extending
intermediate and substantially therebetween. The first or outer aperture 30 may be
divided by a support rib 40 extending between the internal member 34 and the outer
side 26. The rib 40 supports the internal member 34. It is noted that first aperture 30
may be removed or covered. The internal member 34 may be single or multiple parts.
[0045] The second aperture 32 is arranged to fittingly receive the joiner 12 in the
fitted condition. The outer side 26 includes one or more apertures 42 (shown in Figure
7) arranged to allow one or more fasteners 44 to be passed there through and traverse
the first aperture 30 and the provided void 36 so as to secure the joiner 12 to the

                                            -7
internal member 34 in the fitted condition. The one or more fasteners 44 each include
a shank 43 and a head 44. The dimension of the first aperture 30 and the provided
void 36 is such that the head 46 of fastener 44 is substantially concealed by the first
aperture 30 in the fitted condition and abuts with the internal member 34.
[0046] Turning now to the joiner 12 in more detail, as best shown in Figures 2 and 13
to 17, each joiner 12 includes body 50 portions 52 shaped to be received by respective
apertures 32 of two sections 10 to be connected. The portions 52 may perpendicular to
one another such that the body 50 is generally right-angled in section. However, other
shapes such as a straight body or various other angles may also be provided and a
right-angled shape is provided herein for example purposes only.
[0047] Each of the portions 52 includes a recess 54 arranged to align with one or
more of the fastener apertures 42 of the respective sections 10 in the fitted condition.
The recess 54 is shaped to provide a space 56 to capture excess material generated in
the fitted condition in which one or more fastener screws 44 passes through the
respective one or more fastener apertures 44 and into the portions 52 at the respective
recesses 54. The excess material may be "swarf" generated by screwing the fastener
screws 44 through the internal member 34 and/or the joiner 12.
[0048] The portions 52 include an inner wall 58 and an outer wall 60 having a space
62 there between and a rib 64 extending between the inner wall 58 and the outer wall
60. The recess 54 is provided in the form of channels 66 in the outer wall 60 that span
transversely between opposing sides 68 of the portions 52. Leading edges 70 of the
portions 52 are each rounded for ease of insertion into the respective joiner aperture
32 of the section 10.
[0049] In use, a method for forming the frame 16 using at least two of the sections 12
and the joiner 12 may include the steps of: fitting portions 52 of the joiner 12 into
respective joiner apertures 32 at opposing ends 18 of respective bodies 15 of the at
least two sections 12. The channels 66 of the portions 52 are aligned with the fastener
apertures 42 in the outer side 26 of the least two sections 12.
[0050] The fasteners 44 may then be fitted through the apertures 42 so as to pass into

                                              -8
 and at least partially through the voids 36 defined between the respective outer sides
26 and the internal members 34. The fasteners 44 are then actuated so as to fasten the
portions 52 of the joiner 12 to the respective internal members 34 with heads 46 of the
fasteners being received by and located within the respective voids 36.
 [0051] Advantageously, there has been described an assembly including a joiner and
 a section. The section may take a variety of forms and includes a joining section
having a joiner aperture to receive portions of the joiner and a void defined between
 an internal abutment or support surface of the joiner aperture and an outer wall of the
 section. Fasteners, typically self-drilling, can be passed through the fastener aperture
 in the outer wall to traverse the void and allow the fastener connect the portions of the
joiner to the abutment or support surface section. The head of the fastener is received
by the fastener aperture, hidden or concealed within the void and abutted with the
 internal member. The fastener apertures may be covered, if required. The portions of
the joiner may include channels to account for the swarf thereby promoting a good
 connection between the joiner and section. The universal nature of the assembly
 allows the section to take a variety of form whilst keeping the same joining section
 and joiner. Moreover, the connection between the joiner and section is robust, fast and
 aesthetically pleasing.
