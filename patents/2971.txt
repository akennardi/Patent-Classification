   three        coils        that       are      mutually           orthogonal            to     each         other,
   on       flexible              printed           circuit             board        (PCB).             The         PCB
   comprises            an      insulating             substrate           having         a     first          and       a
   second         side,          and      conducting             elements          of      the        coils         are
15 formed        on     only one of               the     sides,         so that        the      PCB       is    also
   termed a single-sided PCB.                              In order to            form the             coils        the
   flexible           single-sided                PCB     is    rolled        up,      in     a    Swiss          roll

   the coils.
             In     one      embodiment              a    flexible          insulating              substrate,
   having a first side                       and a second side, is rolled about an
   axis       parallel           to     the      substrate.             Prior     to      the      rolling,              a
25 first         planar           conducting               spiral          that       is        right-handed
   relative            to      a    normal          to      the      substrate,             and        a      second
   planar        conducting              spiral         that      is     left-handed             relative              to
   the normal, is formed on the first side of the                                                  substrate.
             The       first         conducting              spiral         has      a     first           initial
30 termination and a                     first       final termination, and the                               second
                                                                 13

   conducting          spiral         has    a     second         initial          termination           and     a
   second      final       termination.               There         is     a   displacement            with      a
   preset      magnitude             between         the       spirals,            so     that     when       the
   substrate         is       rolled        about         the         axis       the       first      initial
 5 termination aligns with the second initial termination.
           A   conductive              via    penetrates               the       substrate         from       the
   first      side      to     the     second        side        so     as     to    interconnect             the
   first        initial             termination               and           the       second          initial
   termination of the two spirals.
10         Forming          a     set      of     three         mutually            orthogonal            coils
   from a      single-sided PCB                   significantly reduces the                           cost of
   preparing         such       coils,        compared             to     prior       art      systems        for
   producing the coils.

          Referring             to      Figs.         2A,      2B,        and       2C,       sheet        80
10 comprises         a        flexible           insulating,              substantially                 two
   dimensional           (2D),       substrate           82,     having         a    first       side      84
   and a    second side              86.      In    one    embodiment             substrate           82   is
   formed     from       a    polyimide          material,           but       other       embodiments
   may comprise any convenient flexible insulating material.
15 In  producing           sensor         24,    sheet       80    is     typically           initially
   clad with conducting material, typically copper, on first
   side     84,      while          second          side        86      does        not       have        any
   conducting         cladding.            Thus,       in    the      following            description
   side    84   is     also       referred          to    as     conducting             side     84,      and
20 side 86 is also referred to as non-conducting side 86.
          For     clarity           in     the      description              of     sheet       80,      the
   sheet     is     assumed           to      be     referenced              to     a     set     of     xyz
   orthogonal        axes,        wherein         the     sheet        lies      in     an    xy plane,
   and   there      is      a   z   axis       normal       to    the       sheet.        In    Figs.      2A
25 and   2B   the      z    axis      is     assumed        to be         directed          out    of     the
   plane of the paper.
          On     the       conducting            side       three         sets       of      conducting
   elements         are         formed.           The       conducting                elements            are
   rectilinear,           i.e.,       all     parts       of    the element              are    straight
30 lines which are in                  one of        two orthogonal               directions.             The

   spiral          conductors               96A,          96B,       96C,       96D.        A    third         set       100,
   illustrated                  in      Fig.            2B,        comprises              a       third           set        of
   conductive               lines         102,         and       in     Fig.        2B      there        are        by     way
10 example four lines 102A, 102B,                                       102C, and 102D.
              The      spirals           of      first         set      90      are      positioned               along        a

   described             below         the        spirals            are      generally             similar.             Each
   spiral          of      set       90     has        an     initial            termination                110       and      a
15 final         termination                112,         so    that        the       four       example            spirals
   in    the      figure have                initial            terminations                110A,        110B,         110C,

   Adjacent             spirals           are        typically              mirror           images,            in     a     yz

   handed          direction             about           the      normal.            Thus,        as     illustrated
   by      the       arrows           around            the        spirals            in      Fig.        2A,        spiral

   the       spirals              of      set      90      align          with         themselves,               as    is
   illustrated schematically in Fig.                                         3.    In addition, initial

   adjacent             spirals           on     conducting               side      84      is     approximately
   constant,              but       differs          because             as      sheet         80     rolls        about

   110C of           spirals          92B,       92C,       a second via 132                     connects final
   terminations                 112C and 112D, and a second via 132                                          connects
   final        terminations 112A and 112B. As is shown in Fig.                                                        2A,
15 the end spirals are                         only connected to one other spiral by
   one       termination                of      the      end        spiral           and      a   via,        and      the
   other         termination                of     the     end       spiral           is     not     connected          to
   any spiral.
              Except         for the           following             differences, the                    spirals        of
20 second            set        94       are        generally               similar            in      layout          and
   configuration                  to     the      spirals          of      first         set     90.     Thus,       each
   spiral           of     set      94      has      an      initial            termination              120      and     a
   final         termination                122,       so     that        the       four       example         spirals
   in the          figure have initial terminations                                         120A, 120B,            120C,
25 120D        and       final        terminations                  122A,          122B,        122C,       122D.       As
   for       set       90,        in     set       94     adjacent               spirals          are      typically
   mirror          images,          in      a   yz    mirror          plane          centered         between          the
   spirals,            so      that        the      spirals           alternate              between         rotating
   in     a    right        handed           direction             around          a     normal       to    sheet       80
30 and in a left handed direction about the normal.
                                                                     20

              The        spirals           of     set      94    are       also        positioned              along       a
   line       segment parallel to the x-axis, and the                                                  spirals have
   substantially the                        same      separations on                  the line            segment as
   the       spirals            of      set       90.      In     the       rolled          up      configuration
 5 described                 above,           the        spirals             of        set         94       are      also
   connected,                  by       vias          130       and          132,         substantially                  as
   described              above        for      set      90.     However           the       line       segment        for
   set      94     is      displaced             relative            to     the      line        segment         of    set
   90.        The         displacement                  is      in       both         the        x      and      the       y
10 directions.                 A     y     displacement                160       causes           set       94    to     be
   displaced,               with       respect          to     set       90,     parallel             to    the    sheet
   axis.        y     displacement                 160      is     illustrated                in     Figs.       2A    and
   2C,     and        in     Fig.        3.    An     x    displacement                162       is     selected         so
   that in           sensor 24,              an     angle 0 subtended by sets                               90   and 94

   Fig.       2A,        and      the      corresponding                angle        6    is      illustrated            in
   Fig. 4A.
              As       illustrated                in     Fig.         2B,       and       as       stated        above,
   third          set           100         of       conducting               elements                comprises            a
20 plurality               of     conducting             lines         102,       and       except          for    their
   terminations,                   the      lines        are      typically             parallel             to   the      x
   axis        and         typically             have        equal          lengths.             The       lines       are
   displaced               along       the       y    axis      relative            to      each        other.       Each
   line       has        an    initial           termination               and a        final          termination,
25 both       of      which         are       offset         in      the      y    direction              from     their
   respective line.                      Thus,        the four example                     lines         102A, 102B,
   102C,         and        102D       in      the      figure          have       initial             terminations
   104A, 104B,                104C,         104D and final terminations                                  106A,     106B,
   106C,        106D respectively.
30            Each conducting line                          102      defines a             ray on         first      side

   laid out on                surface 84              so that the rays                   of each line have
   a    common          direction.              Fig.        2B     illustrates             two       rays      having
   the       common           direction,                a     first          ray       108A       from        initial
 5 termination                104A to          final termination 106A for line                                   102A,
   and      a    second          ray       108D        from       initial           termination              104D    to
   final termination 106D for line                                      102D.
              In     addition,              the        conducting              lines       of      set       100    are
   displaced relative                       to each other, parallel to                               the y axis,
10 so     that        in      the      rolled           up     configuration                described            above
   the      initial           termination                of     a    given        line      102      aligns       with
   the       final         termination                 of     a    neighboring              line         102.      This
   alignment applies                      except          for the          initial termination of a
   "first"          line        of    set       100      and for          the      final       termination           of
15 a    "last"         line       of     the      set,       which        are      not    aligned with              any
   terminations.
              In the          rolled up configuration, each pair                                        of aligned
   terminations                  in     set        100       is      connected            by      a     respective

20 side        of      sheet        80       to      the      second           side      of      the       sheet     to
   interconnect the                     initial termination of a given line with
   the final             termination of a neighboring line. Vias                                              140 are

30 coils         has        two       "free"           terminations,                   i.e.,        terminations

   set       (spirals              or      lines)          the       current            traverses            all       the
10 elements           of      the       set      in    a     common         direction.              Each      coil       of
   sensor         24       thus        operates,              in    response             to    an      alternating
   magnetic           field          traversing              the     coil,        in     the     same way           as    a
   coil        of     wire          in      the       field,           generating              an      alternating

15 Thus,         via        connected               sets         90.       94,        and      100       behave          as
   respective               coils         of     wire,          so    that       in      the     via       connected

   sensor         viewed           orthogonal              to      the     sensor          axis.        In    the      end
   view       rolled          up       sheet        80     is     shown        as      a   circle,          and      sets

             Fig.        5B      is      a   schematic              depiction             of     a    sensor         224,
   according             to     an      embodiment              of    the     present           invention.             The
30 depiction             of     sensor          224      is      similar         to      that       of     sensor        24
   in     Fig.       5A.       Apart         from       the       differences               described           below,
                                                                    23
             3450553v1

   the    operation           of    sensor           224       is      generally         similar          to    that
   of   sensor        24      (Figs.         1     -    5A) ,        and     elements          indicated           by
   the    same       reference           numerals                in     both     sensors           24    and     224
   are generally similar in construction and in operation.
 5         In     sensor        224      a     set       of       conducting           elements           100A     is
   generally            similar            in         construction                  to       set        100,       as
   described          above        with          respect              to    Fig.       2B      and       Fig.      3.
   However, in sensor 224,                          while          sets     94A and 90A correspond
   respectively in operation to                                 sets      94 and 90 of              sensor 24,
10 the    construction              of      sets         94A        and     90A     is     different            from
   that of sets 94 and 90.
           As    is illustrated in the                             side view,           sets 94A and 90A
   lie    in    a    common        plane         that         is      orthogonal           to     sensor        axis
   150,      whereas         sets       94      and        90       lie     in     different            disjoint
15 planes         orthogonal                to          the          sensor          axis.           Thus,         in
   constructing            sensor           224,         rather           than      sets        94A      and      90A
   lying      on    different            line         segments            parallel           to     the     x-axis
    (Fig.     2A)     on    sheet        80      in     its         unrolled        up     state,         the    two
   sets of        spirals         lie on a common straight line                                   segment. On
20 the common line                segment, the different spirals of the                                          two
   sets are         interleaved, and are                           located on the line                    segment
   so   that      when       sheet        80      is     rolled           up,     the     spirals          of    set
   94A       overlap           and         alternate                   in      rotation             direction.
   Similarly,          the      spirals            of     set        90A     overlap          and     alternate
25 in rotation           direction. Both sets of                              spirals are             connected
   by vias as described above with respect to Fig. 2A.
           Fig.       5C    is     a    schematic                 depiction          of      a    sensor        324,
   according         to    an     embodiment                of      the    present          invention.           The
   depiction          of   sensor          324       is      similar          to    that       of     sensor       24
30 in   Fig.       5A.    Apart         from         the       differences             described            below,
   the    operation           of    sensor           324       is      generally         similar          to    that
                                                                  24

   of    sensor        224       (Figs.        1    -   5A,    5B) ,     and elements             indicated
   by    the     same        reference            numerals           in    both     sensors          224     and
   324        are       generally               similar            in     construction               and      in
   operation.
 5           In contrast to sensor 224                            which has three coils that
   are     orthogonal             to    each       other,        sensor        324   comprises           three
   pairs       of    similar          coils,          the    coils      in    a   given      pair      having
   a    common        axis       of    symmetry            and     being      separated          along       the
   axis. The           three axes             of the three pairs are orthogonal to
10 each       other.          Thus,          in       sensor        324     each      of      a     pair      of
   conducting coils                  10OB1,          100B2      is generally similar                   to set
   100A       (Fig. 5B),           the pair having a common axis of                                 symmetry
   coincident with sensor axis                              150,      each of the           coils in         the
   pair      defining           a  respective              plane       orthogonal          to    the     axis,
15 the planes            being        separated            along       the    axis.      In    sensor        324
   each        of      a    pair         of       conducting             coils        94B1,         94B2      is
   generally           similar          to      set      94A,      the     pair     having         a   common
   axis      of    symmetry           orthogonal             to,     and intersecting,                 sensor
   axis       150,       and      being         separated           along       the     axis.        Also     in
20 sensor 324,            each of a pair of conducting coils                                   9OB1,       90B2
   is     generally             similar           to      set      90A      (Fig.      5B),       the      pair
   having        a     common         axis        of      symmetry         orthogonal           to     sensor
   axis      150     and to         the       axis       of   coils       94B1,      94B2,       and     being
   separated along the axis.
25          When       used       as    a    magnetic          field       generator         rather        than
   as a sensor, each pair in sensor 324 may be configured to
   act       as     a     Helmholtz              pair        of      coils,        so     that       at      the
   intersection              of      the       three        axes      of    symmetry          there       is    a
   region of nearly uniform magnetic field.

   sensors         424,        according              to   an     embodiment          of     the     present
                                                               25

   invention.           The    depiction            of    sensors        424    is    similar       to
   that of sensor             24 in       Fig.      5A.     Apart     from the differences
   described            below,        the       operation            of      sensors        424     is
   generally         similar        to     that      of    sensor       24    (Figs.     1   -   5A),
 5 and elements            indicated by the same                     reference       numerals       in
   both        sensors        24     and        424      are       generally         similar        in
   construction and in operation.
             In contrast to sensor 24,                      which comprises one set of
   orthogonal           coils,      sensors         424     comprise        two    or more       sets
10 of orthogonal coils. Each set is substantially similar to
   sensor        24.     However,          sensors         424     are     constructed          on    a
   single         sheet       80A,       which         has      substantially           the      same
   properties           as     sheet       80      (described          above).       However,         a
   length        of    sheet     80A,       measured          along     a   line    parallel        to
15 the     y    axis,      which      is     parallel,           as    explained       above,       to
   sensor        axis     150,    is     typically           larger      than    that     of sheet
   80,     and the        length      is     selected          so as to        accommodate         the
   plurality of orthogonal sensors on sheet 80A.
             Figs.        6A,     6B,        and       6C      are      schematic          diagrams
20 illustrating             a   flexible           sheet        80C    used      to    produce        a
   sensor          524,       and       Fig.         7      is     a      schematic         diagram
   illustrating            how      the      sheet       is      rolled      up    to    form      the
   sensor,          according          to      an       embodiment           of    the      present
   invention.           Fig.     6A     illustrates             a   top    portion       of    sheet
25 80C,       and    Fig.      6B    illustrates              a   bottom       portion       of    the
   sheet,        both     figures        being        viewed       from     above     the     sheet.
   Fig.       6C    is     a    side       view       of     sheet      80C.      Fig.     7    is    a
   schematic perspective view of the formed sensor.
            Apart        from     the       differences            described         below,        the
30 operation         of    sensor       524     is     generally         similar      to    that    of

   generally           similar           in    construction              and     in     operation.              As
   for     sensor        24,      sensor       524      comprises          three       coils       oriented
   orthogonally to each other.
 5           Sensor       24     is     formed        from      single       sheet       80,     which        has
   single        layers        of      conducting           elements          on     conducting             side
   84     of   the     sheet        for      each      of   its     coils,        and     there        are      no
   conducting            elements            within        substrate           82     of      the      sheet.
   Sensor        524     is also          formed from a              single        sheet       80C, which
10 also        has        single            layers        of      conducting              elements              on
   conducting side 84                    of the        sheet. However, in addition, in
   sheet        80C      there         are     one       or     more       conducting            elements,

             Apart        from        the         differences                described            below,        the

30            In   contrast          to     sensor          24,     sensor          624     is    formed      from
   a    plurality           of     substantially                  similar           single         sheets.         By

   way     of    example,         sensor       624     is       assumed       to     be     formed         from
   three       sheets       80,      80D,      and     80E.         However,         embodiments               of
   the present invention may form sensors from any number of
   substantially             identical           sheets.           Sheets        80D      and       80E      are

   described above with reference to sensor 24.
            Thus,       sheets       80D     and    80E        have      respective           conducting
   sides       84D,      84E     and      non-conducting                 sides      86D,       86E        (Fig.
   8C).      On      conducting           side     84D         there       are     a     plurality             of
10 spiral        conductors           D92     and     D96,        and     a   set       of    conductive
   lines       D102,       which       are     respectively                congruent           to     spiral
   conductors          92,    96    and lines           102.       Also,     on    conducting              side
   84E     there      are     a    plurality           of      spiral       conductors              E92      and
   E96,       and     a    set       of      conductive             lines        E102,        which          are
15 respectively            congruent           to     spiral          conductors            92,      96      and
   lines      102.
            Prior       to    rolling         up,      sheets           80,    80D,       and       80E      are
   stacked        on each        other       so   that        the     conducting            side      of     one
   sheet       contacts          the      non-conducting                 side      of      an      abutting
20 sheet,         and     so     that        congruent             elements          in     each         sheet
   align. Thus, as              shown in         Fig. 8C,            sheet      80    overlays sheet
   80D, which in turn overlays sheet 80E.
            Once       aligned,           initial         and         final       terminations                 of

   configurations.              Thus,        the    initial           and    final        terminations
   of     spiral        conductors            92,      D92,         and     E92       are       connected

          Sensor       24    is     formed        on    single          sheet        80,     which       has

   there are one or more conducting elements, similar to                                                 and

25 respective layers within substrate 82                                  of the        sheet. As          is
   described       below,        the multiple              sets      of     aligned         conducting

   sets        of      spirals,            each       set          comprising              three       spirals

   vias        140      connect          sets       of        conductive             lines,         each       set
   comprising three lines                       already connected in parallel.
             Fig.        10      is      a    schematic                diagram           illustrating               a
   flexible sheet                180     used to produce a sensor 724,                                and Fig.
10 11     is    a    schematic           diagram          illustrating               how       the   sheet       is
   rolled        up    to      form     the    sensor,            according           to an        embodiment
   of      the      present          invention.               Apart          from      the       differences
   described below, the operation of sensor 724                                                 is generally
   similar to that of                    sensor 24             (Figs. 1 -           5A),        and elements
15 indicated           by the        same      reference              numerals          in     both    sensors
   24     and     724      are    generally            similar            in    construction            and      in
   operation.
             In     contrast          to     sensor          24,      wherein          the       elements        of
   the        sensor           are       formed            from          rectilinear               conducting
20 elements           having         sections           which          are       orthogonal           to     each
   other,          the       elements          of     two          sets        90E,       94E      of    spiral
   conducting               elements           of       sensor            724       are        formed         from
   curvilinear              elements.         Also        in      contrast         to      sensor      24,     the
   conducting            lines       of    a   third          set     100E       of   conducting           lines
25 of    the      sensor        do    not     have       initial           terminations             and    final
   terminations which are                       offset from the                   lines;         rather each
   conducting             line      of     the      third           coil       of    sensor         724     is      a
   line,       typically           a   straight            line,         from its          initial      to     its
   final termination.
30           Set      90E       comprises           four          curvilinear               spirals        192A,
   192B,          192C,         and      192D       which            have        respective            initial
                                                                 32

   terminations            210A,        210B,        210C,         210D      and     final
   terminations 212A, 212B, 212C, 212D, and as for set 90 of
   sensor     24,    the     spirals       of   set     90E    are    positioned       on   a
   straight       line      segment      and    adjacent          spirals     are   mirror
 5 images    of each other.            Thus,     as   illustrated         by the arrows
   around     the    spirals       in    Fig.     10,     spiral     conductors       192A,
   192C    rotate       in     a   right      handed       direction,        and    spiral
   conductors 192B, 192D rotate in a left handed direction.
         As    for sensor         24,    in   the rolled up          configuration        of
10 sensor 724,       the spirals of set 90E align with themselves,
   so that initial terminations 210A, 210B, 210C, 210D align
   with themselves, and final terminations 212A, 212B, 212C,
   212D also align with themselves.
         As    for the rolled up configuration                       of sensor      24,   in
15 the rolled up configuration of sensor 724,                            except for end
   spirals,      an initial        termination         is    connected      by a via to
   an initial termination of an adjacent spiral, and a final
   termination is connected by a via to a final termination.
   In   the     example        illustrated,          vias      130    connect      initial
20 terminations        210A and 210B,           210C      and 210D,       and a via      132
   connects       final      terminations         212B     and     212C.    End    spirals
   192A,    192D     each     have    a    respective        final     termination       not
   connected to another spiral.
          Except for the           following differences, the spirals of
25 set 94E are generally similar in layout and configuration
   to the spirals of set 90E. Thus, the four example spirals
   in the figure have initial terminations 220A, 220B, 220C,
   220D    and     final     terminations          222A,      222B,     222C,    222D.    As
   for   set    90E,     in    set    94E    adjacent        spirals      are   typically
30 mirror     images,        in   a mirror         plane      centered      between      the
   spirals,      so   that      the    spirals       alternate       between      rotating
                                                    33

   and in a left handed direction about the normal.
              The      spirals         of    set      94E       are     also        positioned               along        a
   straight            line        segment        parallel            to     the      90E       line        segment,
 5 and      the       spirals          have      substantially                 the       same         separations
   on    their          line       segment        as    the       spirals          of      set      90E.      In     the
   rolled          up     configuration              of     sensor         724      the       spirals         of     set
   94E      align          with      themselves,              as     do     the       initial            and     final
   terminations                  of     the        set.         The       terminations                    are      also
10 connected, by vias                     130 and 132,                as    is illustrated in                      Fig.
   10.
             As      for       sensor       24,     the        line       segment           for       set     94E      is
   displaced              relative         to     the       line       segment           of      set       90E.      The
   displacement                  is     substantially                  as      described               above         for
15 sensor 24              and is       such that in the                    rolled up configuration

   connected by a via                        140      to,      final         termination 206C. As for

   not necessarily comprise sections which are orthogonal to

   convenient angles with each other, such as being sections
   of  a   hexagon       or     an    octagon.         In     addition,          in   the     case   of
   the   conducting         lines       comprising            sets     such       as  set      100,  it
   will be understood that at                     least a part             of such lines may
