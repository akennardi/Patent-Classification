   FIELD OF THE INVENTON
 5
           The invention relates in general to the field of high fidelity audio
   reproduction and to the design process and selection of a sealed loudspeaker.
   In particular, the invention relates to the design of a sealed high fidelity
   loudspeaker using professional sound reinforcement drivers which can be used
10 for the audiophile and home user environment.
           The invention also extends to the design of a loudspeaker driver with a
   low frequency cut-off, high efficiency and good transient response which can be
   housed      in a sealed    enclosure   suitable for the audiophile and         home
15 environment.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           It should be noted that reference to the prior art herein is not to be taken
20 as an acknowledgement that such prior art constitutes common general
   knowledge in the art.
           Where high fidelity reproduction of sound is required, many requirements
   must be met. The most basic of these requirements is that the loudspeaker
25 must be designed to reproduce all of the human audible frequency range.
   Therefore, a loudspeaker is an electroacoustic transducer which converts an
   electrical audio signal into a corresponding sound.         A loudspeaker for the
   audiophile or home user will typically include an enclosure in which speaker
   drivers and associated electronic hardware, such as crossover circuits, are
30 mounted. The simplest of enclosures are designed from rectangular particle
   board boxes.       The very complex loudspeaker cabinets can incorporate
   composite materials, internal baffles, horns, ports and acoustic insulation.

                                            2
           The enclosure housing provides a resonance space.            One of the
   fundamental requirements for designing a loudspeaker is to achieve a low
   resonant frequency in a speaker enclosure that has a relatively small internal
   volume and this comes at a compromise.         With the loudspeaker transducer
 5 mounted within an enclosure or box the ability to reproduce sound is dependent
   on the interaction of the motion of the transducer to the acoustic behaviour of
   the enclosure.
           Sealed loudspeaker design has always been difficult due to the reduction
10 in low frequency efficiency of the transducer when placed in an enclosure. This
   inefficiency, coupled with the large enclosure needed to match the performance
   of a typical modestly sized ported design has resulted in sealed designs being
   relatively rare and in particular in the audiophile and home user market.
   However, one advantage of using a sealed design is the accurate time-domain
15 step response and a far gentler low frequency (LF) roll-off.     Using a sealed
   enclosure also provides a usable output which extends to a much lower
   frequency.
           The use of professional sound reinforcement drivers (PA Drivers) was
20 designed to reinforce sound to make it louder or distribute it to a wider
   audience.      Therefore, professional sound reinforcement (PA) drivers are
   defined as drivers designed for large scale and large area applications including
   performance halls, cinemas, clubs, concerts, places of worship and outdoor
   venues. A PA bass driver or woofer when compared with its Hi-Fi equivalent is
25 physically much larger in size.       Professional sound reinforcement drivers
   designed for low frequency bass reproduction to the lowest octave of the
   audible spectrum are 15, 18 and 21 inches in diameter and almost always
   employ a surround that is of the accordion type giving rigidity. These drivers
   also have a large power handling and lower compliance suspension system (in
30 comparison to Hi Fi speakers) with the resonant frequency (Fs) of the driver
   being higher as a compromise.          Therefore for these drivers to operate
   effectively requires either very large enclosures and/or ported enclosure
   designs.

                                              3
           Where    high   fidelity reproduction   of sound        is required,   multiple
   loudspeaker transducers are often mounted in the same enclosure, each
   reproducing a part of the audible frequency range.
 5         Clearly it would      be advantageous if a sealed loudspeaker and
   loudspeaker driver could be devised that helped to at least ameliorate some of
   the shortcomings described above.          In particular, it would be beneficial to
   provide a sealed loudspeaker, loudspeaker driver and design process for
   producing    loudspeakers      and  drivers   which    utilised   professional  sound
10 reinforcement (PA) drivers to produce a loudspeaker which was suitable for the
   audiophile and home environment.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
15         In accordance with a first aspect, the present invention provides a sealed
   loudspeaker for the home and audiophile markets, the loudspeaker comprising:
   at least one professional sound reinforcement driver; a crossover network; a
   sealed enclosure; and wherein the enclosure has a volume of less than 400
   litres and the at least one professional sound reinforcement driver has a small

25         Preferably, the total system quality may be 0.707.
           Preferably, at least one of the professional sound reinforcement drivers
   may have a driver diameter of between 15 inches to 21 inches.

           Preferably, the loudspeaker may be a 2-way speaker comprising a bass
   driver and a tweeter or coaxial driver selected from the professional sound
   reinforcement drivers. The tweeter driver may be selected to match the bass
   drivers characteristics including, power handling, usable frequency to ensure
 5 complete audio spectrum is covered, dispersion characteristics, and high
   frequency sensitivity to align with the bass driver sensitivity.
           Alternatively, the loudspeaker may be a 3-way speaker comprising a
   bass driver, a midrange driver and a tweeter driver selected from the
10 professional sound reinforcement drivers. The midrange and tweeter drivers
   may be selected to match the bass drivers characteristics including, power
   handling, usable frequency to ensure complete audio spectrum is covered,
   dispersion characteristics, and midrange and high frequency sensitivities to
   align with the bass driver sensitivity.
15
           Preferably, the bass driver may have a sealed cut-off frequency of less
   than 70Hz for an enclosure volume of less than 400 Litres. The bass driver

   efficiency of greater than 1.5% and a flat response to a target frequency of
20 50Hz in a sealed enclosure limited to a volume of less than 250 Litres. The
   bass driver may provide a 70Hz or below cut-off frequency in a sealed
   enclosure of less than 250 Litres with a total quality of the system (Qtc) of
   between 0.5 and 1.0. The bass driver may further comprise a Zobel network
   connected in parallel with the bass driver in order to compensate for the bass
25 driver's voice coil inductance and thus ensure a predictable crossover
   frequency.
           Preferably, the tweeter driver may be selected from any one of a
   compression driver, an air motion transformer, a horn loaded piezoelectric
30 tweeter, a dome tweeter, a cone tweeter or a conventional ribbon tweeter.
           Preferably, the midrange driver may be selected from any one of a
   closed back midrange driver, compression driver, an open back midrange
   driver, or an air motion transformer.

   while leaving a space inside the cabinet that is unoccupied by the at least one
   professional sound reinforcement driver; and wherein the cabinet and the at
 5 least one professional sound reinforcement driver form a sealed enclosure.
           Preferably, the enclosure may further comprise a damping material
   mounted in the space inside the cabinet to minimise internal resonances. The
   damping material may be a polyester textile fibre, foam, rubber or fibre
10 reinforced plastic that is wrinkle-resistant and strong or a combination of these
   materials.

   cabinet could be shaped as a sphere. Alternatively, the cabinet may have at
15 least two walls, the at least two walls having the same or different-sized wall
   surfaces and/or the at least two walls are formed parallel to one another or not
   parallel to one another. Further alternatively, the cabinet may be shaped as a
   rectangular box to reduce baffle diffraction effects. The rectangular box may
   further comprise at least one bevelled edge on a front surface of the cabinet.
20 Alternatively, all edges of the front surface of the cabinet may be bevelled.
           Preferably, the cabinet may further comprise internal bracing to minimise
   the amplitude of vibration when exposed to a time varying internal pressure.
25         Preferably, the cabinet and the internal bracing may be manufactured
   from a medium-density fibreboard or plywood, an external surface of the
   rectangular box is covered with any one or more of a thin decorative covering
   such as a veneer or a covering finish such as carpet, varnish or paint.
   Alternatively, the cabinet and the internal bracing may be manufactured from a
30 mixture of solid timber such as birch wood and birch plywood.               Further
   alternatively, the cabinet and the internal bracing may be manufactured from a
   plastics material or any other suitable material which provides a cabinet with
   walls that are strong such that resonances and unwanted vibrations are well
   damped.

           Preferably, the cabinet, the internal bracing and the at least one
   professional sound reinforcement driver mounted in the cabinet may be all
   mounted, sealed and screwed in place and an adhesive or sealant such as a
   silicone or polyurethane caulk that will remain flexible is used to seal all joints
 5 and provide a substantially air tight enclosure.

   crossover network filter for a 3-way loudspeaker. For the 3-way loudspeaker,
   step (f) may further comprise selecting an appropriate midrange professional
   sound reinforcement driver to match the bass driver selected in step (c) and the
   crossover network calculated in step (e).

   determined through an audio testing setup to determine for the sealed
   enclosure loudspeaker: (i) a driver free air resonant frequency (Fs); and (ii) a
 5 minimum usable total driver quality (Qts).         The experimentally determined
   characteristics are further refined by calculating a practical driver or total driver
   quality (Qts) for a set desirable sealed cut-off frequency or resonant frequency
   of 50Hz or less for an enclosure total quality of the system (Qtc) of between 0.5
   and 1.0.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
10         The following description, given by way of example only, is described in
   order to provide a more precise understanding of the subject matter of a
   preferred embodiment or embodiments.
           The present invention has been devised to overcome a need in the field
15 of high fidelity audio reproduction for sealed loudspeakers 10 using professional
   sound reinforcement drivers 20, 30, 40, wherein the loudspeaker 10 can be
   used for the audiophile and home user environment.        A high efficiency Hi-Fi
   loudspeaker design is used to form the basis for a sealed loudspeaker 10
   comprising a professional sound reinforcement bass driver 20 determined using
20 the calculated characteristics described below, paired with an appropriately
   matched professional sound reinforcement tweeter drivers 30 and/or midrange
   drivers 40. A sealed enclosure prevents sound emitted from the rear of the
   loudspeaker 10 cancelling with the front by confining the drivers 20, 30, 40 in a
   rigid and airtight box.
25
           A loudspeaker 10 is an electroacoustic transducer which converts an
   electrical audio signal into a corresponding sound. What we hear as sound is a
   class of kinetic energy called acoustical energy and consists of fluctuating
   waves of pressure in air. This periodic vibration which is audible to the average
30 human is known as the audio frequency spectrum.          The accepted standard
   range of audible frequencies is 20 to 20,000 Hertz (Hz), although this range is
   greatly influenced by environmental factors and age.
           Loudspeakers or speakers 10 are typically housed in an enclosure which

                                             11
   is often a rectangular or square box made of wood or sometimes plastic, and
   the enclosure plays an important role in the quality of the sound. However, the
   shape of the loudspeaker 10 is not only limited to those shapes and any shaped
   enclosure or cabinet can be utilised. For example, the enclosure could be any
 5 regular or irregular prism shaped three dimensional object.
           To adequately reproduce a wide range of frequencies with even
   coverage, most loudspeaker systems 10 employ more than one driver.
   Individual drivers are used to reproduce different frequency ranges. The drivers
10 are named subwoofers (for very low frequencies); bass drivers or woofers (low
   frequencies) 20, mid-range speakers (middle frequencies) 40, tweeters (high
   frequencies) 30 and coaxial drivers (not shown).          The terms for different
   speaker drivers differ, depending on the application. In two-way systems there
   is no mid-range driver 40, so the task of reproducing the mid-range sounds falls
15 upon the woofer 20 and tweeter 30 or a coaxial driver. When multiple drivers
   are used in a system, a "filter network", called a crossover 50, separates the
   incoming signal into different frequency ranges and routes them to the
   appropriate driver 20, 30, 40.       A loudspeaker system 10 with a three-way
   system employs a woofer 20, a mid-range 40, and a tweeter 30 or coaxial
20 driver.
           A typical sound reinforcement system consists of a number of key
   components.      The present invention is directed primarily to the design of a
   loudspeaker 10 using a professional sound reinforcement driver which converts
25 the electrical audio signal back into sound energy (the sound heard by the
   audience and the performers). From a specifications point of view, it has been
   noted that the bass drivers 20 have a high sensitivity >96db 1W/m, a high
   reference efficiency >1.5%, a low compliance volume (Vas) (generally observed
   to be at least half of their Hi-Fi Equivalents for the same size) and a driver size
30 that is physically large.
           By way of example only professional sound reinforcement drivers 20, 30,
   40 have as a result of their diaphragm surface area and also their efficiency an
   advantage when compared with standard hi-fi drivers. Mathematically this is

                                                  12
   quite evident from the analysis below.            The SPL of a driver operating in its
   pistonic area of operation mounted on an infinite baffle for a set frequency at a
   distance of 1m away is given by Equation 1.
 5        SPLaB = 20 log         10 (                             Equation 1

          Sd =   cone surface area in m2

   100 dB the calculated excursion of the professional sound reinforcement drivers
   is considerably smaller than the Hi-Fi drivers. The next aspect to look at is how
   much power is required for each of these drivers to reach the 100dB threshold

          Professional sound reinforcement drivers designed for low frequency
   bass reproduction to the lowest octave of the audible spectrum, are 15, 18 and
   21 inches in diameter and almost always employ a surround that is of the
   accordion type giving rigidity. These drivers also have a large power handling
10 and lower compliance suspension system (in comparison to Hi Fi speakers)
   with the resonant frequency (Fs) of the driver being higher as a compromise.
   Professional sound reinforcement drivers used for the reproduction of mid and
   high frequencies e.g. line arrays often have sensitivities greater than 98dB
   1W/m.     These are based on compression drivers, piezo, horn loaded and
15 pleated diaphragm tweeters (Air Motion Transformers).
          These    drivers   are  also   desirable,  in  that  professional    sound
   reinforcement drivers have subtle tone characteristics that are desired by live
   performers, which make them difficult to quantify and which conventional Hi-Fi
20 loudspeaker systems struggle to reproduce. The downside in almost all cases
   is a very large enclosure and is a key challenge to be solved in this design.
          As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the present invention is a sealed loudspeaker
   10 designed for the home and audiophile markets. The loudspeaker 10 has at
25 least one professional sound reinforcement driver 20, 30, 40. Fig. 1 shows a
   two-way design with a bass driver 20 and a tweeter driver 30, and a crossover
   network 50 mounted inside the sealed enclosure 11.       The cabinet or case 11
   has located on the rear surface a speaker box terminal cup 13 with the binding
   post terminals 12 for connecting the loudspeaker 10 to an amplifier (not shown).
30
          In accordance with the present invention the sealed enclosure has an
   enclosure volume of less than 400 litres. The limiting of the enclosure volume
   ensures that the physical size of the loudspeaker 10 is appropriate for the
   audiophile and home user environment. The professional sound reinforcement

                                            15
   bass driver 20 utilised in the loudspeaker 10 has a small compliance volume
   (Vas) or a large system compliance ratio (a) for a total system quality of
   between 0.5 and 1.0.      Through design and experimentation the professional
   sound reinforcement driver which will meet the above criteria has a bass driver
 5 diameter of between 15 inches to 21 inches. The bass driver 20 has a 70Hz or
   below cut-off frequency in a sealed enclosure with a total quality of the system
   (Qtc) of between 0.5 and 1.0.
           The sealed enclosure illustrated has an enclosure volume of less than
10 250 litres. The limiting of the enclosure volume ensures that the physical size
   of the loudspeaker 10 is appropriate for the audiophile and home user
   environment. The professional sound reinforcement bass driver 20 utilised in
   the loudspeaker 10 has a small compliance volume (Vas) or a large system
   compliance ratio (a) for a total system quality of between 0.5 and 1.0.
15
           To produce low frequencies a driver needs to have a large diaphragm
   and enough mass to resonate at a low frequency. The most common design
   for the bass driver 20 is the electrodynamic driver, which typically uses a stiff
   paper cone 22, driven by a voice coil (not shown) surrounded by a magnet 24
20 producing a magnetic field. The voice coil is attached by adhesives to the back
   of the speaker cone 22 and a dust cap 23 covers the front of the voice coil. The
   voice coil and the magnet 24 form a linear electric motor. When current flows
   through the voice coil, the coil moves in relation to the frame 26, causing the
   coil to push or pull on the driver cone 22 in a piston-like way. The resulting
25 motion of the cone 22 creates sound waves, as it moves in and out. Terminals
   25 attached to the rear side of the frame 26 allow the current to flow from the
   low pass filter 54 of the crossover network 50 to the voice coil. A variety of
   terminal types can be used, including simple push-on terminals 25 as shown or
   alternatively gold-plated binding posts.
30
           The bass driver 20 has a number of mounting holes 21 equally spaced
   around the circumference of the mounting flange 28, the mounting holes 21
   allow for the mounting of the bass driver 20 to the cabinet 11.       A frame 26
   provides a rigid structure to which the driver components are mounted.         A

                                          16
   gasket 27 ensures a smooth and flat mounting surface so that the bass driver
   20 has an airtight seal to the box or cabinet 11.   Optionally, since most bass
   drivers 20 are mounted using the back side of the mounting flange 28, a rear
   (optional) gasket is often desired.
 5
            Bass driver 20 design requires effectively converting a low frequency
   amplifier signal to mechanical air movement with high fidelity and acceptable
   efficiency, and is both assisted and complicated by the necessity of using a
   loudspeaker enclosure to couple the cone motion to the air. At ordinary sound
10 pressure levels (SPL), most humans can hear down to about 20 Hz. The bass
   driver 20 covers the lowest octaves of a loudspeaker's frequency range. In the
   two-way loudspeaker system illustrated in Figs 1 and 2, the bass driver 20
   handling the lower frequencies are also used to cover a substantial part of the
   midrange, possibly as high as 3000 Hz.
15
            To produce high frequencies a driver needs to have a small diaphragm
   with a low mass.     In Figs. 1 and 2 the high frequencies are covered by the
   tweeter driver 30.       The tweeter 30 is designed to produce high audio
   frequencies, typically from around 2,000 Hz to 20,000 Hz. The tweeter drivers
20 30 are the smaller drivers since they produce the highest frequencies with the
   shortest wavelengths. The tweeter driver 30 has a sealed back 32 to stop air
   movement from the bass driver 20 affecting the output and prevent damage to
   the tweeter 30. This removes the need for a separate enclosure for the tweeter
   30. The tweeter 30 has a front mounting plate 31 with mounting holes 35 for
25 mounting the tweeter driver 30 to the cabinet or case 11. The tweeter driver 30
   comes in a number of different configurations which are distinguished by the
   components, motor topology and the materials used. The tweeter driver 30
   could be any one of an electrostatic speaker, a piezo tweeter, a dome or cone
   tweeter, an air motion transformer (AMT) or a planar ribbon (planar magnetic)
30 tweeter.
            By way of example only, an air motion transformer (AMT) tweeter 30 is
   illustrated in Figs 1 and 2.     The AMT tweeter 30 uses a folded thin film
   diaphragm 33 with aluminium conductors that are formed similar to an

                                              17
   accordion squeezebox with the diaphragm 33 placed between opposing
   magnets. When signal current is passed it starts oscillating in the plane of the
   diaphragm 33 with folds contracting and expanding and thus squeezing air in
   and out.

           Fig. 2 also shows the crossover network 50 and the wiring connections
   between the binding post terminals 12 and the connection between the drivers
   20, 30 and the respective filters 53, 54 of the crossover network 50.
10         Fig. 3 shows an embodiment of the sealed loudspeaker 10 for a 2-way
   speaker design with a bass driver 20 and a high frequency or tweeter driver 30.
   The case or cabinet 11 is rectangular enclosure. As noted above, the shape of
   the enclosure is not only limited to a rectangular shape and could be any
   shape. The role of the enclosure is to prevent sound waves emanating from
15 the back of a driver 20 from interfering destructively with those from the front.
   The sound waves emitted from the back are 1800 out of phase with those
   emitted forward, so without an enclosure they typically cause cancellations
   which significantly degrade the level and quality of sound at low frequencies.
   The sealed enclosure prevents transmission of the sound emitted from the rear
20 of the loudspeaker by confining the sound in a rigid and airtight box. By way of
   example only, the case 11 is constructed from timber of approximately 18mm in
   thickness with a damping material (not shown). The damping material used in
   this example is a polyester textile fibre or fibre reinforced plastic. The enclosure
   volume is approximately 220 litres excluding internal bracing (not shown) and
25 driver 20 volume displacement.
           One of the limiting effects of a loudspeaker enclosure design is the effect
   of diffraction.   The radius edge provides an enclosure which reduces the
   magnitude of the diffracted wave, since the wave does not immediately expand
30 into space upon reaching the edge. The benefits of edge rounding come into
   play only when the radius is greater than 1/8th wavelength. Thus a typical 1/2
   inch radius begins to diffuse the diffracted wave at frequencies above 3.4 kHz,
   but will decrease in relevance at lower frequencies, when the sound output from
   driver interacts with the edge due to its increasing directivity.

          Fig. 4 shows a typical Zobel network 70 to linearise the impedance of a
   bass driver 20.    As shown, the Zobel network 70 is a series resistor (R1),
   capacitor (Cl) network that is connected in parallel with the bass driver 20 in
   order to neutralize the effects of the driver's voice coil inductance.   In most
 5 designs and as shown in Fig. 5 the Zobel network 70 is mounted on the
   crossover network 50 circuit board.
          Fig. 5 illustrates the crossover network 50 for a 2-way loudspeaker
   design with a bass driver 20 and a tweeter driver 30. The crossover network 50
10 as illustrated is a parallel crossover network 50 with a low frequency driver
   connector 51, a high frequency driver connector 52 and an input connection
   from the binding post terminal 12 all mounted on the crossover network circuit
   board. As discussed above the Zobel network 70 is connected in parallel with
   the bass driver 20. A low pass filter 54 is designed to pass signals with a
15 frequency lower than a certain cut-off frequency and attenuates signals with
   frequencies higher than the cut-off frequency, the low pass filter 54 passes the
   signals to the bass driver 20.      The exact frequency response of the filter
   depends on the filter design and will be discussed in detail below in relation to
   the crossover design steps in the process for designing the loudspeaker 10. A
20 high pass filter 53 passes signals with a frequency higher than the cut-off
   frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies lower than the cut-off
   frequency, the high pass filter passes signals to the tweeter driver 30.     The
   amount of attenuation for each frequency depends on the filter design and will
   be discussed in detail below in relation to the crossover design steps in the
25 process for designing the loudspeaker 10.
          Figs. 6 to 10 show a speaker enclosure or cabinet 80 in accordance with
   an embodiment of the present invention. The loudspeaker enclosure or cabinet
   80 consists of a top and bottom panel 81, two side panels 84, a rear wall 88
30 and a front speaker baffle panel 85. With all panels 81, 84, 88 and 85 joined to
   form an interior space 82 defining the loudspeaker enclosure or cabinet 80.
   The rear edge of each panel 81, 84 has a mitred recess 83 which is designed to
   receive the rear panel 88 therein. The rear wall panel 88 also has an aperture
   89 cut into the panel 88 to receive box terminal cup 13.

                                           19
           The speaker baffle 85 forms the front face of the loudspeaker 80 and
   serves as the mounting surface for the tweeter 30, bass driver 20 and midrange
   driver 40. The mounting surface of the speaker baffle 85 has as illustrated, two
   apertures 86, 87 for receiving the bass driver 20 and the tweeter driver 30.
 5 Along with holding the drivers 20, 30 in place, the speaker baffle 85 also
   prevents out of phase air from the back of the drivers 20, 30 cancelling the front
   air wave and therefore preventing phase cancellation. The speaker baffle 85
   also has a rounded or chamfered edge 90, the rounded edge 90 reduces
   diffraction. The rounded edge 90 of the speaker baffle 85 is a very effective
10 means of controlling cabinet diffraction and smoothing the overall frequency
   response.
           Given that sound is pressure, or more precisely, it is the propagation of
   pressure waves in air, we need to understand that this pressure is pushing a
15 waveform that is expanding to fill the space around it in a spherical manner. In
   other words, it is expanding in all directions equally. The acoustic effects of
   diffraction are always directly related to the ratio of distance versus the
   wavelength of sound at a given frequency. When a loudspeaker produces a
   sound, this sound is in the form of a pressure wave trying to expand equally in
20 all directions spherically. The first obstacle that this wave encounters is the
   baffle face itself before reaching the baffle edge.   If the baffle edge is sharp,
   there is a very sudden change in the propagation of the wave.           The sharp
   corner acts like an obstacle changing the direction of the wave; the wave
   diffracts and the edge becomes a secondary source, reradiating sound back
25 towards the original wave. The bevelling of the edge reduces the discontinuity
   in the waveform.
           The sealed enclosures 11, 80 described above have been designed so
   that the professional sound reinforcement drivers 20, 30, 40 are completely
30 housed in a box of an appropriate size to prevent sounds from being radiated
   from the rear of the drivers, confining the back sound wave within the rigid
   airtight box 11, 80.   Thus, only sound waves radiated from the front side of
   drivers 20, 30, 40 will reach the listeners.    Sealed type enclosures 11, 80
   provide accurate low frequency reproduction with good transient response.

                                             20
           In order to absorb the back wave of the speaker and minimise enclosure
   standing waves, a damping material is placed inside the interior space 82 of the
   enclosure 11,     80.    The damping material is a fibrous material such as
   fibreglass, bonded acetate fiber (BAF), long-fiber wool, polyester textile fibre,
 5 fibre reinforced plastic, glass wool, wool, or synthetic fiber batting that is
   wrinkle-resistant and strong. However other types of damping material may be
   used for example, carpet or other like materials provided they absorb the back
   wave of sound from the drivers 20, 30, 40. The internal shape of the enclosure
   11, 80 can also be designed to reduce this by reflecting sounds away from the
10 driver diaphragms, where they may then be absorbed. This includes the use of
   internal bracing. Internal bracing can be used to reinforce the cabinet walls or
   for extra support for the speaker baffle.         The speaker baffles should be
   reinforced in particular when the baffle has been weakened by the cut-outs or
   apertures formed in the baffle for the drivers 20, 30, 40.           In the prototype
15 design, the bass driver frame actually forms part of the bracing frame providing
   even more rigidity to the enclosure.       Internal bracing can also be utilised to
   prevent large, wide walls from flexing.
           The enclosures 11, 80 in order to provide the sealed air tight nature
20 require particular attention be paid to the bonding and joining of each side. An
   appropriate adhesive is required to ensure that each side of the enclosures 11,
   80 are strongly joined to each other.         The sides of the enclosure and the
   attachment of the drivers 20, 30, 40 to the baffle 85 require that they be
   mounted, sealed and screwed in place. By way of example only, the adhesive
25 or sealant is a silicone or polyurethane caulk that will remain flexible, the caulk
   is used to seal all joints and provide a substantially air tight enclosure.
           Other techniques may be used to reduce transmission of sound through
   the walls of the cabinet 11, 80 and include using thicker cabinet walls, lossy
30 wall material, internal bracing or curved cabinet walls. The cabinet walls and
   internal bracing are manufactured from a medium-density fibreboard (MDF) or
   plywood.     For example, the cabinet 11, 80 and the internal bracing are
   manufactured from a mixture of solid timber and birch plywood. Many materials
   may be used for the cabinet 11, 80 and the internal bracing provides the

                                              21
   finished product with walls that are strong such that resonances and cabinet
   vibrations are reduced as much as possible. An external surface of the cabinet
   or case 11, 80 is covered with any one or more of a thin decorative covering
   such as a veneer or a covering finish such as carpet, varnish or paint.
 5
           The speaker mounting scheme (including cabinets) can also cause
   diffraction, resulting in peaks and dips in the frequency response. The problem
   is usually greatest at higher frequencies, where wavelengths are similar to, or
   smaller than, cabinet dimensions. The enclosure 11, 80 or driver 20, 30, 40
10 must have a small leak so internal and external pressures can equalise over
   time, to compensate for barometric pressure or altitude. Typically, the porous
   nature of cones and surrounds 22 are normally sufficient to provide this slow
   pressure equalisation.
15         A speaker grille or grill (not shown) is usually found in front of the
   loudspeaker 10, and consists of either a hard or soft screen/grille mounted
   directly over the face of the professional sound reinforcement drivers 20, 30,
   40. It is used to protect the driver elements and speaker internals from foreign
   objects while still allowing the sound to clearly pass. The speaker grill can be
20 manufactured from acoustic grill cloth, speaker grille clips as well as metal grills
   and plastic grills.
           Figs 11 and 12 show the on-axis frequency response for the loudspeaker
   10. Fig 11 shows the predicted response for the loudspeaker 10 that reaches
25 the listener's ear in an ideal small room. The on-axis frequency response is the
   response which determines how a loudspeaker sounds.                 In an on-axis
   frequency response measurement, the microphone is placed directly in front of
   the speaker a set distance away. The microphone is at the same vertical height
   as the speaker, and is facing the speaker directly, not from an angle.         The
30 speaker itself is also facing the microphone. This is done with the assumption
   that when one listens to a given speaker, the speakers will be positioned such
   that they will be facing the listener directly.
           In the absence of an anechoic chamber, the on-axis frequency response

                                              22
   measurements are conducted with a 2.83VRMS (1W @ 80) excitation signal at
   a distance determined by proper summing of all drivers in the system.         This
   distance is determined by successively conducting a windowed measurement.
   The windowed measurement is a signal processing technique applied to only
 5 use the part of a measured impulse response that contains data before the first
   reflection of the sound from the nearest surface (usually the ceiling or ground).
   Calculating the length of the reflection free path and dividing by the speed of
   sound determines the reflection time.         The windowed measuring technique
   starts at 3 times the largest dimension of the source and decreases the
10 measurement distance in steps until one step before response deviations are
   apparent. The SPL response for all measurements is then scaled to 1 meter
   mathematically.
           Fig.    12 shows the modelled on-axis frequency response for the
15 loudspeaker 10 as if it was measured in an anechoic chamber.            One of the
   most useful places to conduct loudspeaker measurements is an anechoic
   chamber. Anechoic chambers are large rooms with very thick sound absorption
   material     on   all surfaces    and  offer a   good  estimation   of free-space
   measurements down to a cut-off frequency specific to the chamber. Anechoic
20 chambers can be calibrated to measure loudspeakers to frequencies below the
   cut-off frequency allowing full acoustic spectrum measurements. As above for
   Fig. 11, the graph shown in Fig. 12 shows the resulting SPL in dB mapped over
   the frequency range for the loudspeaker 10 in an anechoic chamber.
25         Alternatively a ground plane also with windowing and near field for low
   frequencies (half space) measurement techniques can be used. This type of
   measurement is performed by placing the speaker onto a hard reflective
   surface and the microphone on the ground and the measurement is taken with
   unwanted data windowed out. The graph shown in Fig. 14 shows the resulting
30 SPL in dB mapped over the frequency range for a half space ground plane
   measured on-axis frequency response for the loudspeaker 10.
           Figs. 17 to 20 illustrate the method or process 100 for designing a sealed
   loudspeaker 10 for the home and audiophile markets. The process can also be

                                               23
   adapted to the design of a professional sound reinforcement driver for the
   loudspeaker 10.      In it broadest form as illustrated in Fig. 17 the process 100
   includes the steps of starting the process at step 101 by performing thorough
   experimentation tests using a microphone and signal generator to determine
 5 102 the required characteristics which form the basis for a high fidelity driver.
   Step 103 shows the calculated values for each of the Thiele/Small parameters
   or characteristics. It is to be noted that all calculations and measurements are
   based on a half space radiation pattern where the system is only radiating in
   the forward hemisphere.        Baffle step loss, where low frequencies can radiate
10 omnidirectionally, are not discussed in the design methodology. The baffle step
   loss is highly dependent on baffle size and the listening environment.         In the
   case of a large diameter low frequency driver, the front baffle size is quite large
   and the baffle step loss transition occurs at a low frequency. The baffle step
   loss is also highly dependent on the application being used.          In a domestic
15 environment, speakers are generally used within a reasonable proximity to a
   rear wall or potentially mounted against/recessed into a wall, reducing the
   measureable baffle step loss considerably. Baffle step correction circuitry can
   be incorporated into crossover or amplifier designs when the intended
   application does not get reinforcement from rear boundaries.
20
           To obtain a low frequency cut-off, high efficiency, good transient
   response and an enclosure design usable in the home environment, the
   following professional sound reinforcement driver characteristics have been
   determined 102,112 as a first pass baseline for sealed enclosure loudspeaker
25 systems 10 and are summarised in Table 3 below.

                                            24
   professional sound reinforcement drivers have been identified that range in size
   from between 15 to 21 inches in diameter.           Sealed enclosures have an
   optimally flat response and the lowest -3dB cut-off frequency (F3) when the
   enclosure total quality of the system is equal to 0.707 (Qtc = 0.707). A Qtc of
 5 0.707 also provides good transient response. At a Qtc of 0.707 the F3 is equal
   to the resonant frequency (Fb) (resonant frequency and cut-off frequency of the
   enclosure driver pair in the sealed enclosure). The following steps and Fig. 18
   and step 110 will show the calculation 103 of the values for each of the
   identified important Thiele/Small (T/S) parameters 111 for the selection of the
10 professional sound reinforcement bass driver 20.
           T/S commonly refers to a set of electromechanical parameters that
   define the specified low frequency performance of a loudspeaker driver. These
   parameters are published in specification sheets by driver manufacturers so
15 that designers have a guide in selecting off-the-shelf drivers for loudspeaker
   designs.    Using these parameters, a loudspeaker designer may simulate the
   position, velocity and acceleration of the diaphragm, the input impedance and
   the sound output of a system comprising a loudspeaker and enclosure. Many
   of the parameters are strictly defined only at the resonant frequency, but the
20 approach is generally applicable in the frequency range where the diaphragm
   motion is largely pistonic, i.e. when the entire cone moves in and out as a unit
   without cone breakup.
           Fig 18 shows the steps for determining the bass driver characteristics
25 111.    To achieve a flat frequency response with a roll off of -10dB or less at
   30Hz requires an Fb of approximately 50 Hz or lower in a sealed enclosure of
   Qtc 0.707.    The driver resonant frequency in a sealed enclosure (Fb) is a
   function of the driver total quality (Qts) and enclosure Qtc.        The cut-off
   frequency at (Qtc 0.707) is given by Equation 3:
30
                      Fb = F3 = Qtc*Fs                  Equation 3
                                     Qts
           To achieve this, Table 4 below redefines the characteristics of Table 3

                                             25
   and provides a practical driver Qts for a 50Hz cut-off frequency.         The table
   shows the comparison between Qts, Fs and Fb = 50Hz with an enclosure Qtc =
   0.707 as shown at step 113 of Fig. 10. Note for an enclosure to have a Qtc of
   0.707, the driver cannot have a Qts >= 0.707. The measurements in Table 4
 5 show the bass driver Qts required to give a driver resonant frequency and half
   space cut-off frequency F3 equal to 50Hz at different driver resonant
   frequencies.

         Driver Qts
            It is important to note in Table 4 above that the Fs and Qts
   characteristics of the bass driver are desirable for this application and it is not
   expected that many of the available drivers will have these characteristics. To
20 achieve an Fb less than 50Hz in a sealed enclosure with Qtc equal to 0.707 is
   difficult, as it would require even higher minimum Qts values for the same
   resonant frequencies.     For example, a flat response sealed enclosure Qtc of
   0.707 with a desired Fb of 40 Hz would require a driver with Fs of 35, 30 and 25
   Hz to need relatively speaking, high Qts values of 0.62, 0.53 and 0.44
25 respectively. Therefore in order to calculate the Qts at 50Hz or lower we need
   to refine the characteristics as shown in step 114 as follows.
            From this we can summarise the data mathematically in Table 4 to be
   able to calculate a Qts value based on the Fs for a given cut-off frequency. To
30 make analysis easier, let's set a baseline sealed frequency threshold of 50Hz
   and call this Spero's Sealed Frequency Target = Fb()         = 50Hz as a target Fb
   desired sealed cut-off frequency, Fs is the driver free air resonance frequency
   and Qts is the total driver Q.     The formula assumes a system Qtc equal to
   0.707 the best case scenario, and applicable to drivers of Qts < 0.707. The

                                             26
   detailed reasoning for selecting Fb(g) = 50Hz will be explained in more detail in
   the next section.

           Thus Table 4 can be expanded to include all Fs and Qts values that will
   achieve an Fb(g) equal to 50Hz.            Table 5 below shows the expanded
   parameters identified in Table 4 calculated using the Equation 4a above.

30         Equation 4a can be used for any desired minimum sealed cut-off
   frequency by replacing Fb(g) with Fb and setting Fb to any desired frequency.
   However, 50Hz was chosen due to both the difficulty in finding drivers with

                                           27
   sufficient Qts to give practical lower Fb frequencies and secondly due to the
   desire to tie in loudspeaker low frequency roll off with typical listening room
   gains to achieve a flat response.
 5         Before looking at the next aspect of driver selection, it is important to
   consider listening room gain. This in fact was one of the determining factors in
   selecting the Spero Sealed Target Frequency of 50Hz discussed earlier.          A
   typical home listening room is very different to the anechoic environment that
   loudspeaker specifications are determined.
10
           An anechoic system is designed to almost eliminate all resonances and
   reverberations such that the measurements obtained, are solely from the output
   of the driver under test.   A listening room scenario has numerous resonant
   modes and this in fact can be used to an advantage. Consider the scenario of
15 a listening room in a home environment of 36 square meters (6mx6m) and a
   standard ceiling height.    In this instance the frequency that has the same
   wavelength of 6m can be determined from Equation 5.
                             C =f * A            Equation 5
20
           In this instance the speed of sound in air (C) equals 346m/s at 25
   degrees Celsius and wavelength (A) equals 6m.         Thus from the formula the
   frequency (f) equals 58Hz. Therefore a listening room of 6m x 6m will result in
   any frequency less than 58 Hz not completing a full cycle before reflecting off a
25 surrounding wall.     There are a number of models that have been used to
   estimate room gain for a loudspeaker and all make varying assumptions about
   the sound absorption/reflections of the fittings, fixtures, room treatments and
   materials found in the room, room sizes and ceiling heights. As an example,
   referenced to OdB Table 6 shows a modelled room gain, the frequency
30 response of a loudspeaker expected in an anechoic environment with a target
   Fb of 50Hz and the corrected response with the addition of the room gain
   model.

        Response (dB)
           Looking at the result above, it can be seen how a low frequency
10 response quoted to have a cut-off frequency of 50Hz (-3dB) in an anechoic
   scenario now has an in-room cut-off frequency less than 30Hz (-2dB) giving
   additional credence to the selection of a 50Hz cut-off frequency F(Q). Very little
   music and program material is recorded below 30Hz and even so, the model
   above still shows that at 20Hz we still have useful output (-6dB) when factoring
15 in room gain.
           The next stage of the bass driver selection is to determine the
   compliance volume (Vas) at step 115 by considering the enclosure sizing.
   Enclosure volume is related to the compliance volume Vas of the bass driver
20 20. To achieve a small enclosure size requires either a small Vas and or a
   large ratio a for a Qts equal to 0.707. A Qtc to Qts ratio of 1.41 (12) gives the
   term of a in the formula below a value of 1 and the box volume equals the driver
   Vas. In a sealed alignment of Qtc       = 0.707, the box volume (Vb) is given by
   Equation 6a.
25
                                 Vb =                 Equation 6a
                         a = (0107                    Equation 6b
           Looking at this closely and as further shown in Equation 6b, driver
30 selection of professional sound reinforcement drivers is limited further as a
   large Qts approaching Qtc of 0.707 decreases a causing the required enclosure
   size to increase by orders of magnitude above the Vas. This is ok if the Vas is

                                                   29
   very small but small Vas drivers have higher Fs values and thus impractical to
   meet the target Fb(g). If we take the example of limiting the box volume to 250
   L and use the driver Qts values given in Table 4, we obtain the following Vas
   limits in Table 7.         The calculations obtained in Table 7 show the driver
 5 compliance       volume       Vas    requirements       to  fulfil the    cut-off   frequency
   requirements from Table 4 and limiting the maximum enclosure volume to
   250L.

           The next step 116 and 11 6a is to calculate the reference efficiency of the

20 values are well outside of the range available commercially.                    In a practical
   sense, bass drivers for professional sound reinforcement generally have
   greater than 1.5% = 94 dB 1W/m calculated reference efficiencies and stated
   sensitivities often 2- 6 dB greater which should limit the Vas and Fs options
   further.    We can use this characteristic to refine the available options.                The
25 reference efficiency of a driver is given by Equation 7.

30 simplify calculations, the electrical quality factor (Qes) of a driver 20 is observed
   to be close in value to the driver Qts as shown from Equation 8 below. This is
   not unexpected as the mechanical quality factor (Qms) used in determining the
   Qts is a large value thus making the Qes the dominant term in calculating the

                                                   30
   Qts of a driver. Using the Qts values from Table 5 as approximate Qes values
   and the Vas values from Table 7 above gives the following efficiencies in Table
   9.    Table 8 compares Qes to Qts and shows the difference in reference
   efficiency calculations for a sample of drivers to demonstrate the rationale for
 5 using the Qts instead of Qes in simplifying the estimation of reference
   efficiency.

            To summarise, the small number of commercially available drivers
   identified with their characteristics listed in Table 13, provide a possible
   explanation as to why professional sound reinforcement drivers have not been
   used in Hi-Fi applications.      At the time of writing and after mathematically
 5 modelling the hundreds of drivers available against the criteria determined, only
   ten (10) drivers shown in Table 13 were identified with the potential to meet the
   system design requirements.
            In addition to these ten (10) drivers, a single 15 inch driver was found,
10 however it was found to require an enclosure size of approximately 300L due to
   its high Qts and was excluded from Table 13. Perhaps the drivers identified,
   which are not designed for Hi-Fi applications meet the discussed design criteria
   in the preceding pages as a side effect of meeting a different design
   requirement.       Nonetheless, this invention captures the methodology for
15 identifying   professional   sound    reinforcement    drivers suitable  for   Hi-Fi
   applications and also the required characteristics needed to produce new Hi-Fi
   bass drivers based on PA driver topologies that can be used to build high end
   Hi-Fi audiophile loudspeaker systems. The majority of the drivers could be
   used in a system without requiring a subwoofer. As a result, the design criteria
20 discussed also covers the design of standalone sealed subwoofer enclosures
   for the home environment.
            Low frequency driver selection also needs to include driver motor
   strength. The driver's motor strength is easily represented by the BI parameter
25 which is the product of the magnet field strength in the voice coil gap and the
   length of wire in the magnetic field measured in tesla-meters (T m).         This is
   important and to understand this fully, we must understand how the motor
   strength affects the Q of the driver, which as we know from above, is one of the
   critical parameters in determining its sealed enclosure suitability. The total Q of
30 the driver, as discussed previously, is dominated by the drivers electrical Q
   (Qes) and is given by the equation below where Re is the voice coil DC
   resistance, Mms is the moving mass, Fs is the resonant frequency and BI is the
   magnet field strength product.

                                             34
                  Qes    = (27r*Fs*Mms*Re
                                  (RI) 2  )Euto       Equation 9
           It can be seen from Equation 9, that a large BI product and hence a
   strong driver motor will reduce the Qes (and subsequently the Qts) reducing its
 5 suitability for a sealed enclosure.       Generally speaking, drivers for sealed
   enclosures have a weaker motor than those drivers designed for horn loaded,
   vented, passive radiator and bandpass enclosures. Whilst the selection criteria
   did not specifically target motor strength, by using the Qes and reference
   efficiency as we did above, we have indirectly achieved the same result we
10 could have achieved by focussing on motor strength.
           Moving forward, now that we have identified a list of suitable bass drivers
   20 (Table 13), the next step in the process or method 100 for designing a
   sealed loudspeaker 10 for the home and audiophile markets is to select one
15 bass driver 20 which can be used to produce the loudspeaker 10. This is step
   104. Once chosen the next stage is to analyse the selected bass driver 20 to
   determine the tweeter driver 30 for a 2-way system or both a tweeter driver 30
   and midrange driver 40 for a 3-way speaker system.
20         With the enclosure sizing and bass driver 20 selection now understood,
   the focus shifts to sound reproduction for the remainder of the audio spectrum.
   There are a number of means of achieving this ranging from compression
   drivers, closed back midranges, Air Motion Transformers and horn loaded
   Piezo' s. Before we look at these technologies it is critical to understand what
25 frequency range we are asking the drivers to reproduce. To do this effectively
   we need to look at the upper frequency response of the identified bass drivers.
   At step 105 we now determine the mid-range frequency response of the
   selected bass drivers 20.
30         Fig. 19 illustrates the steps 120 for determining the mid-range frequency
   response 122 of the bass driver 20.        In order to understand and analyse the
   mid/high frequency performance of step 105 (Fig. 17), 122 (Fig. 19) of the
   selected bass driver 20, we must first look at and comprehend the woofer

                                            35
   breakup modes, voice coil inductance and driver beaming as shown in step
   123. The purpose of calculating these values is not to accurately determine
   what crossover point to use as some drivers with different cone geometries (for
   example curvilinear vs straight sided) don't follow these rules specifically. The
 5 calculations are an approximate guideline and discussion point to assist in
   determining what mid and high frequency requirements are likely for driver size.
   The actual crossover frequency and driver split is only truly determined
   empirically by looking at frequency response specifications from driver
   manufacturer at step 123a.
10
           Cone breakup occurs when the loudspeaker cone no longer behaves as
   a uniform air piston. At low frequencies a cone moves as a whole. This is the
   pistonic area of operation. At higher frequencies the cone starts to flex, leading
   to resonances. This is what is referred to as breakup. The cone changes from
15 its pistonic frequency range of operation which is well modelled with T/S
   parameters to non pistonic.       Analysing the resonances of the cone at the
   breakup frequencies, one would visibly see the cone shape of the woofer
   showing multiple flexing deformities and         resultant multiple   non uniform
   resonances across the cone surface. From a frequency response point of view
20 this is often seen as sudden peaks and dips in SPL with intermodulation and
   harmonic distortions also being measurable in some cases. Breakup is often
   apparent with a spike in  2 nd order harmonic distortion and often ripples are also
   usually visible in the impedance curve. Breakup behaviour depends on cone
   material and geometry. Straight sided, ribbed and curvilinear cones all breakup
25 differently and at different frequencies affecting their usable high frequency
   response.     From a cone material perspective, paper has very well damped
   breakup modes, which is one reason why it is commonly used.              More rigid
   materials, like metal, have very bad breakup modes, but fortunately they tend to
   be higher in frequency and so can usually be avoided with careful crossover
30 design.
           Voice Coil Inductance is another consideration.      The voice coil of a
   loudspeaker driver, whilst having a fixed winding resistance, is in essence an
   inductor.   There are both mechanical and electrical Thevenin equivalents to

                                             36
   model a loudspeaker, but for simplicity we are interested in the inductance.
   The impedance of an inductor is given by Equation 10.
                      X(D) = 2rwf * L                   Equation 10
 5
           Thus from the formula above, as frequency increases, so does the
   impedance of the inductive voice coil resulting in less power for the same
   output voltage of the audio amplifier.
10         Driver beaming has been identified as probably the most critical
   influence on the limitation of mid frequency performance of a bass driver 20 as
   it generally occurs before both cone breakup and sufficient impedance due to
   inductance taking effect.      Considerable driver beaming generally occurs at
   frequencies with wavelengths smaller than the diameter of the loudspeaker
15 cone and thus affects the directivity of the driver at those frequencies. This is
   called beaming, as the driver produces sound at a narrowing beam directly in
   front of the driver as the frequency increases. Above the beaming frequency
   the driver off-axis response begins to drop considerably in SPL in comparison
   to the on-axis response. The driver has become increasingly directional and is
20 approaching both its breakup modes and the effects of the voice coil
   inductance.     Experimentation has shown that most drivers are usable up to
   about 1.5 times the beam frequency (providing the target aim is focussed
   primarily on the performance of on-axis response) and at twice the beam
   frequency most drivers are at their breakup modes.             Above the usable
25 frequency drivers are very directional with SPL significantly reduced off-axis. At
   the breakup frequency, not only is the frequency response no longer smooth,
   but there is usually an increase in intermodulation and harmonic distortion
   affecting the fidelity of sound. The driver beaming frequency is calculated using
   Equation 11.

           The next step 106, 124 is to determine a suitable crossover network.
15 Such networks are formed by the combination of capacitors, inductors, and
   resistors and are designed to direct high frequencies to the tweeter driver 30
   and low frequencies to the bass driver 20 in a two way system. A three-way
   crossover network divides the frequency range between the bass driver 20, the
   tweeter driver 30 and a mid-range driver 40.
20
           Table    14 above gives valuable insight into what the crossover
   requirements could look like for the loudspeaker 10. In the event that we would
   like to use a bass driver up to its usable frequency, a low pass second order
   filter -12dB per octave is required to ensure that the crossover began
25 attenuating at the beam frequency, have a cut-off frequency equal to the usable
   upper frequency and be well attenuated -12dB or better at the expected
   breakup frequency. Thus a usable crossover design for a two way system for
   an 18 inch driver theoretically would require a -3dB or -6dB frequency
   (depending on filter design e.g. Linkwitz-Riley, Butterworth) of about 1200 Hz
30 and be -12dB at 1700 Hz.
           In the example of a two way system we might want to pair the 18 inch
   driver with a high frequency driver that has a usable response to at least
   1200Hz. This is ultimately determined on a driver by driver basis empirically by

                                            38
   looking at the frequency response curve.        In a three way arrangement, the
   requirements on the lower end of high frequency driver would be reduced as
   the mid-range driver 40 would fill some of the spectrum allowing for the bass
   driver 20 to be crossed over much lower and the high frequency driver 30 to be
 5 crossed over much higher.
            For passive crossover network designs there are a number of topologies
   of filter design including Butterworth and Linkwitz-Riley. A Butterworth filter is
   calculated to have a cut-off frequency of -3dB and a Linkwitz-Riley arrangement
10 has a cut-off of -6dB. Both of these, for second order designs are -12dB/octave
   and will result in a phase shift of 180 degrees between the low pass 54 and
   high pass 53 filter requiring the high frequency driver (in a 2 way system) to be
   wired with reverse polarity to correct the phase error.
15          Impedance correction is another factor to consider due to rising bass
   driver impedance with frequency as a result of voice coil inductance.            If
   correction is required, a resistor in series with a capacitor and connected in
   parallel with the driver can provide impedance correction. This is known as a
   Zobel network 70.      This can be determined by the loudspeaker impedance
20 curve, the nominal target impedance and the capacitor impedance formula.
   The impedance of a capacitor is given by Equation 12 and the combined
   impedance of a Zobel network is given by Equation 13.               An impedance
   correction schematic is shown in Fig. 6.
25                    Xc(D) =    21*C                           Equation 12

30          The next step in the process 100 is to select suitable mid-range and high
   frequency drivers 40, 30 which match the selected bass driver 20. This is step
   107, 125 in the process. There are hundreds of midrange and tweeter driver

                                             39
   40, 30 combinations that could be used to match suitable bass drivers 20. The
   key to selecting the correct matching drivers 30, 40 falls to a number of key
   points.    Power handling requirements to suitably match the bass driver 20,
   usable frequency of the high frequency and mid frequency drivers 30, 40 to
 5 ensure the complete audio spectrum is covered, dispersion characteristics to
   match the low frequency driver 20 and critically the mid and high frequency
   sensitivities to align with the bass driver 20 sensitivity.
           Mid and high frequency drivers 40, 30 with significantly greater
10 sensitivities can be used, but attenuation (using resistors and L-pads) are
   required to ensure a flat response. This is most common in designs based on
   compression drivers. Power handling selection poses its own challenges but as
   the majority of the power distribution in music is in the bass octaves, most
   designs have an 80-20 power rating split between the bass driver 20 and
15 midrange and tweeter drivers 40, 30. As an example, a bass driver or woofer
   20 rated at 80W should use midrange and tweeter drivers 40, 30 with ratings of
   at least 20W.
           Audio spectrum coverage should have an evenly split octave distribution
20 between drivers 20, 30, 40. In a two way design (based on the 10 critical music
   octaves from 31 Hz to <16000 Hz) a crossover frequency of 1000 Hz will result
   in a 5 octave split between the two drivers 20, 30.         For a three way design,
   things are more difficult.
25         Often considered an ideal scenario is four octaves to the bass driver 20
   (31-500 Hz), three Octaves to the midrange driver 40 (500-4000Hz) and three
   octaves to the tweeter driver 30 (4000 - <16000 Hz). All options have their fan
   base and preferences are subjective between listeners. The aim here is to try
   and create a full smooth frequency response with as little variation across the
30 spectrum as possible and a seamless transition between frequency ranges of
   the different driver combinations. As will be illustrated further below a suitable
   combination for the loudspeaker 10 will be selected.

            This ends 126 the process of analysing the bass driver 20 and
   determining suitable crossover networks 50 and mid-range and high frequency
30 drivers 40, 30.         The next step 108, 130 in the process 100 is to design a
   suitable enclosure 10, 80 to house the bass driver 20 and either or both the
   tweeter driver 30 and mid-range driver 40. One of the key challenges to be
   solved with the design process 100 is providing an appropriate sized enclosure
   10, 80 to house the bass and high frequency professional sound reinforcement
35 drivers 20, 30 which is suitably sized for the home and audiophile markets.

                                             43
           As is shown in Fig. 3, the prototype enclosure is a rectangular box
   enclosure with a chamfered baffle plate forming a sealed enclosure. However
   as noted above other shaped enclosures can be utilised without departing from
   the scope of the present invention.        The first step 131 is to note that the
 5 enclosure size is related to the compliance volume (Vas). The next step 132 is
   to determine the Vas for the available professional sound reinforcement drivers
   for a sealed enclosure, which is found in Table 13. In order to achieve a small
   enclosure suitable for the audiophile and home user environment in step 133
   the compliance volume must be small or you require a large compliance ratio
10 (a) for an optimum total driver quality (Qts) of 0.707. With this information now
   obtained the next step is to determine the enclosure size at step 134.
           By way of example only, the prototype two way system enclosure 10 has
   a Beyma 18LX60V2 bass driver 20 and a Beyma TPL150 mid and high
15 frequency driver 30. The enclosure 10 has an enclosure volume of 220 L which
   also compensates for internal bracing and bass driver 20 volume displacement.
   The case is 1200mm high by 530mm wide and has a depth of 410mm.                 The
   case is constructed from 18mm and 24mm thick birch wood ply with the internal
   bracing timber cornices and beams. The present invention provides a sealed
20 loudspeaker where the sound reinforcement driver acts as a bracing strut in the
   internal bracing. The bass driver 20 forms a part of the bracing for the sealed
   loudspeaker 10.
           Critically material density and thickness play a large part of the selection
25 process for the enclosure 10. In all aspects of a sealed enclosure, regardless
   of materials chosen, it is important to ensure the enclosure is well sealed and
   well braced.      One must factor into the design the volume occupied by the
   bracing and add this to the determined box dimension calculations, although
   this can be in part compensated by the addition of sufficient damping material.
30 At step 135 we determine the required internal damping material.              In the
   prototype the damping material is a synthetic polyester fabric or fibre such as
   Dacron. In order to reduce enclosure resonances, a damping material is placed
   inside the interior space of the enclosure 10. The next step is to determine the
   shape of the enclosure at step 136.           As described above the prototype

                                             44
   enclosure is a rectangular box enclosure with a chamfered front panel to
   minimise diffraction effects.
           The final step 137 is to build the enclosure 10 and perform the required
 5 testing and measurement to ensure the designed prototype meets the design
   requirement. With a number of computer programs available the testing and
   measurement of the prototype design can be automated and therefore quick to
   obtain the results. The sub-process of designing the appropriate enclosure 130
   is completed at step 138 which ends the process or method of designing a
10 sealed loudspeaker 10 for the home and audiophile markets.
           Reviewing the measurements of the completed system shows some
   interesting off-axis response characteristics worth discussing.        One of the
   benefits not apparent from using a large low frequency driver to a usable
15 frequency above the calculated beam frequency is the potential for creating a
   slightly attenuated off-axis response in the mid frequencies. Whilst this may not
   seem like a benefit, room measurements show that it can help to remove wall
   reflections and thus improve vocal imaging on-axis.         The characteristic dish
   shaped curve which has been named the "p" curve becomes more apparent
20 when we look at the crossover options. In a prototype design with an 18 or 21
   inch driver where the driver output has narrowed off-axis above 1000 Hz due to
   beaming, we are forced to crossover the high frequency driver also at a low
   frequency where its efficiency is generally slightly lower. This can work well if
   the high frequency driver has a low resonant frequency and reasonable power
25 handling. It is for this reason that the "p"curve exists in off-axis measurements.
   This has been both modelled and measured and is another characteristic of
   using this design methodology when the appropriate drivers are selected. The
   30 degree off-axis "p"curve modelled and measured are shown in Figs. 13 and
   15. That is Fig. 13 shows the modelled 30 degree off-axis frequency response
30 for the loudspeaker 10 which is expected in an anechoic chamber.
           The speaker's contribution to the early reflected sound is the frequency
   response at the off axis angles that represent the sound path from loudspeaker
   to boundary to the listener. Fig. 15 shows the actual half space ground plane

                                             45
   measured 30 degree off-axis frequency response achieved by the prototype of
   the loudspeaker 10. The graph shown in Fig. 15, shows the resulting SPL in dB
   mapped over the frequency range. In comparing the two graphs, we can see
   that both the modelled and actual off-axis graphs are comparable in particular
 5 as noted above at 1000 Hz both outputs narrow.
          Looking further into the measurements, Fig. 16 illustrates the measured
   impedance curve with an enclosure tuning frequency of the prototype of
   approximately 50 Hz. The present invention as tested is a 2-way loudspeaker,
10 having an impedance correction Zobel network across the woofer to dampen
   the rising impedance cause by its voice coil inductance and a crossover
   network with a conventional 12dB/octave parallel design.
          As illustrated, speaker impedance is not a single value, instead, it
15 changes with frequency. The most notable feature of the impedance curve is
   the impedance peak located at the system resonant frequency. The resonant
   frequency or driver resonance in the enclosure is approximately 60 ohms
   (Zmax) at 48Hz (Fc).       Using Small's analysis methods, we can verify our
   enclosure tuning Qtc and compare this to the modelled design. To do this we
20 require a number of pieces of information which are already available from the
   impedance curve (Fig. 16) and the dc resistance of the speaker system. The
   loudspeaker system has a dc resistance (Re) measured at approximately 5.6
   ohms. This is expected as the driver data sheet indicated an (Re) of 5.1 ohms
   and the additional wiring and dc resistance of crossover components in the
25 enclosure was expected to be in the range of 0.4 - 0.5 ohms in addition to the
   bass driver's (Re). The first step in the process of analysing the system's low
   frequency performance is to determine the ratio of the peak impedance to the
   systems (Re), this ratio is to be called (rc) and is given by equation 16 below.
30                          rc = zmax                     Equation 16
          From Equation 16 this yields an (rc) equal to 10.7.        Next we need to
   determine from the impedance graph (Fig. 16) the two frequencies above (F2)

                                              46
   and below (Fl) of (Fc) where the impedance is equal to Equation 17.
                      Z(F1, F2) = Re *     VHF              Equation 17
 5        This yields a Z of 18.33 ohms with the frequencies equal to this
   impedance taken from Fig. 16 being approximately 37Hz (Fl) and 58Hz (F2).
   With these identified, we are able to calculate the complete enclosure's
   mechanical Q from Equation 18 using (Fc),(F1),(F2) and (rc) calculated above.
10                     Qmc  =  F2-1

                                                            Equation 18
          This results in a Qmc = 7.48 and from the Qmc we can determine the
   loudspeaker system Qtc from Equation 19.
15                           Qtc   =     5
                                        rc
                                                            Equation 19
          This gives a total system Qtc of 0.698. Table 19 shows the comparison
   between the modelled design and the measured tuning as determined from Fig.
   16.

25        In addition we can also verify the actual F3 point from Fig. 14 and this is
   shown in Table 20.

             To summarise the driver selection process in greater detail now that the
     design method has been verified, Table 21 shows the selection criteria for a
     bass driver 20 for a sealed enclosure loudspeaker 10 limited to an enclosure
     volume of 250 L and Fb = F3 = Fb(g) = 50Hz suitable for the audiophile and
 5   home environment. It is evident that for the desired sealed frequency threshold
     of 50Hz and a reference efficiency of the bass driver greater than 1.5%, that the
     enclosure volume ranges from 95 L to 250L, the ratio a ranges from 7 to 0.65,
     and the total driver quality (Qts) ranges from 0.25 to 0.55 for a total quality of
     the system (Qtc) of 0.7.

   invention as defined in the claims.
 5 ADVANTAGES
           It will be apparent that the present invention relates generally to a sealed
   loudspeaker for the home and audiophile markets. To date, Hi-Fi loudspeakers
   designed for the home and audiophile market have not employed sealed
10 designs based on professional sound reinforcement drivers (PA speakers).
   This is largely due to the fact that, for the majority of these drivers to operate
   effectively they require either a very large enclosure and or ported enclosure
   design. The present process has shown that a small range of these PA bass
   drivers with certain characteristics (Thiele and Small Parameters) exist that can
15 form the basis of true High Fidelity loudspeaker system design for the
   audiophile and home user environment.
           Such designs have many benefits over conventional Hi-Fi application
   loudspeaker designs.        Professional sound reinforcement drivers have an
20 advantage over standard hi-fi drivers as a result of their diaphragm surface area
   and also their efficiency.     Likewise the amount of power required to drive a
   professional sound reinforcement driver to reach the 100dB threshold for an
   enclosure designed to have an F3 (-3dB) frequency of 50Hz is considerably
   lower than that required to drive a conventional Hi-Fi driver.
25
           Sealed enclosures have a gentle low frequency roll off (12db/octave
   below Fb) and a better transient response than ported enclosures.                 Any
   efficiency loss and higher Fb of a sealed enclosure can                 be partially
   compensated by the high efficiency of the professional sound reinforcement
30 driver and this type of driver has several other advantages over normal Hi Fi
   loudspeaker drivers. The advantages of these drivers include: lower distortion
   at the same sound output level of Hi Fi speakers due to the increased
   efficiency, less power requirements for the same SPL, a large surface area to
   reproduce low frequencies with less cone excursion and a greater dynamic

                                           52
   range.     These drivers are also desirable,        in that professional sound
   reinforcement drivers have subtle tone characteristics that are desired by live
   performers, difficult to quantify and which conventional Hi-Fi loudspeaker
   systems struggle to reproduce.
 5
           The advantages provided by the present sealed enclosure are further
   highlighted by the disadvantages of other speaker designs.       For example, to
   design an enclosure for a professional sound reinforcement driver for a very low
   cut-off frequency with a vented enclosure design would mean providing a very
10 large enclosure which would be unsuitable for the home environment. Likewise
   vented designs have a poorer transient response. Similarly, a comparable horn
   loaded design would require a massive or very large enclosure in order to
   achieve a wide fidelity range. The size of the horn loaded enclosure would
   make it unsuitable for the home environment.       This is also the case for any
15 transmission line enclosure for a professional sound reinforcement driver.
           The sealed enclosure design of the present invention has a gentle low
   frequency roll off (12db/octave below Fb) and a better transient response than
   ported or vented enclosures. Any efficiency loss and higher Fb of a sealed
20 enclosure can be partially compensated          by the high efficiency of the
   professional sound reinforcement driver.
           The present invention provides a sealed loudspeaker and the process of
   providing such a speaker for the home and audiophile markets using
25 professional sound reinforcement drivers (PA).        The present invention also
   provides the required characteristics needed to produce high fidelity bass
   drivers based on the PA driver topologies that can be used to build high end Hi
   Fi audiophile loudspeaker systems for the home environment.          The process
   provides the characteristics required for a suitable driver with a low frequency
30 cut-off, high efficiency and good transient response which is suitable for the
   home environment.      The design of an enclosure which will house the above
   mentioned driver is of a size which will allow the driver to be used in the home
   environment.      This both means the present invention provides a sealed

                                              53
   loudspeaker which is both visually appealing while remaining of a size which
   complements the home environment.
           Another advantage or benefit not apparent from using a large low
 5 frequency driver to a usable frequency above the calculated beam frequency is
   the potential for creating a slightly attenuated off-axis response in the mid
   frequencies.      Whilst this may not seem like a benefit, room measurements
   show that it does help to remove wall reflections and thus improve vocal
   imaging on-axis.
10
           The present invention provides a sealed loudspeaker with a substantially
   flat on-axis response and both the on and off-axis response curves are similar
   in shape, therefore providing a sealed loudspeaker where the early reflected
   and late reflected sound as heard in a room will be similar in spectral balance to
15 the direct sound.
   VARIATIONS
           It will be realised that the foregoing has been given by way of illustrative
20 example only and that all other modifications and variations as would be
   apparent to persons skilled in the art are deemed to fall within the broad scope
   and ambit of the invention as herein set forth.
           The term "driver" is used throughout the following discussion to describe
25 the individual sound-generating elements of a loudspeaker. In this context, the
   term "driver" is interchangeable with terms such as "radiator" or "panel", and,
   for specific elements of the speaker, with terms such as the "woofer" or low
   frequency element, the "tweeter" or high-frequency element, etc.
30         The electrical "crossover frequency" between drivers is defined as the
   frequency at which the drivers have equal voltage input. The acoustic
   "crossover frequency" is defined as the frequency where both drivers have
   equal SPL.

                                            54
           The "effective" diameter of a driver is the perimeter of the vibrating
   element divided by Pi.       The nominal diameter of a circular driver is its
   advertised diameter. The "effective" moving area of a driver generally includes
   the cone diameter plus one third of the width of the surround.
