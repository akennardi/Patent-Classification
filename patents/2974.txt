ABSTRACT
A rolling walker comprises a frame, a seat supported by that frame, and a backrest supported by
the frame. By one approach the backrest is configured to selectively move between a first
position that provides back support for a person sitting in the seat facing in a forward direction
and a second position that provides back support for a person sitting in the seat facing in a
rearward direction. If desired, this backrest can be comprised of a material (such as a memory
foam material) that biases the backrest towards that first position when the backrest is in the
first position and that biases the backrest towards the second position when the backrest is in the
second position.

Technical Field
 [0001]         This invention relates generally to rollators (also known as rolling walkers).
Background
 [0002]         Wheelchairs are typically designed to transport a sitting person and so-called
companion chairs are a lighter-duty mechanism having a similar operating purpose.
Accordingly, both wheelchairs and companion chairs typically have leg riggings to support
the transportee 's lower appendages above the ground. Rollators are a walking aid and hence
lack such leg riggings. That said, some rollators include a seat. This seat provides the user
with a place to sit when that need arises (for example, when the user needs a break from
standing or walking).
 100031         The basic design for a rollator is well established; a frame having four ground-
contacting wheels and a pair of handles that the user can grip when walking with the aid of
the rollator. Unfortunately, these deceptively simple design concepts are not always
implemented in a fashion that well suits the needs of the expected user population. Persons
who seek walking assistance can also present a variety of other maladies, infirmities, and
conditions that can, in practice, interfere with their successful use of the rollator. Examples
include, but are not limited to, reduced dexterity or upper-body strength, limited visual
acuity, and reduced cognitive capabilities.
 [00041         The rollator user population also represents a wide variety of usage patterns,
lifestyles, and operating environments. Some users, for example, may only utilize their
roliator within a fairly limited and constrained application setting while other users may need
to frequently transport their rollators in a vehicle and more aggressively use their rollators in
a variety of application settings.

 [0017]         Elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity though are
drawn to scale. Also, common but well-understood elements that are useful or necessary in a
commercially feasible embodiment are often not depicted in order to facilitate a less
obstructed view of these various embodiments. The terms and expressions used herein have
the ordinary technical ineaning as is accorded to such terms and expressions by persons
skilled in the technical field as set forth above except where different specific meanings have
otherwise been set forth herein.
Detailed Description
 100181         Generally speaking, pursuant to some of these various embodiments, a rolling
walker comprises a frame, a seat supported by that frame, and a backrest supported by the
frame. By one approach the backrest is configured to selectively move between a first
position that provides back support flor a person sitting in the seat facing in a forward
direction and a second position that provides back support fir a person sitting in the seat
facing in a rearward direction If desired, this backrest can be comprised of a material (such
as a memory foam material) that biases the backrest towards that first position when the
backrest is in the first position and that biases the backrest towards the second position when
the backrest is in the second position.
[00191          By one approach this backrest can be selectively vertically adjusted to
accommodate persons of dif iSering statures and builds. A simple, intuitive, and relatively
large user interface can provide the mechanism by which the user efreets such an adjustment.
[0020]          By one approach this backrest can include a back-support strap that couples at
either end thereof to a corresponding rotating strap holder. These rotating strap holders can,
in turn, be configured. to provide an elbow support surface to a person sitting on the seat if
desired.
[0021]          To accommodate ease of transport, the frame can be configured to fold about
pivot points between an unfolded state and a folded state. By one approach the right-side legs
of the frame (front and back) become disposed proximal to and substantially parallel to one
                                                 -3 -

another when the frame is in the folded state (as are the lefit-side legs, front and back, of the
frame). If desired, some but not all of the rollator's wheels can be laterally offset with respect
to a point of attachment to the frame. So configured, all of the wheels cart be substantially
coaxial with one another when the frame is collapsed to the folded state. This, in turn, can
permit the frame to be folded to a very compact state to thereby better facilitate, for example,
placing the folded rollator into a limited storage or transport space such as a vehicle's trunk.
 [00221         Also to accommodate ease of transport, and again if desired, the rollator's
handles cart be configured to comprise hand-graspable surfaces that can be selectively rotated
between a deployed state (where the handles are disposed rearwardly of the rollator) and an
undeployed state (where the handles face at least substantially inwardly towards one
another). Using this approach, the handles (it the non-deployed state) cart fit within at least a
depth-based envelope defined by the frame when the frame is it the folded state.
 [0023]         By one approach, a handle height user interface permits one to selectively set
these handles (individually) at an)' of a variety of selectable heights, This handle height user
interface can comprise, for example and at least in part, a user-accessible push button.
[0024]          If desired, the rollator can include brakes that a user asserts using a brake
assertion interface available on the rollator's handles. The brake itself can comprise, at least
irt part, a wheel-contacting surface that is configured to apply brakirtg resistance to multiple
points of contact with each of at least one of the rollator's wheels This wheel-contacting
surface can comprise, for example, a substantially-straight wheel-contacting edge.
[00251          The aforementioned seat can be configured, if desired, to pivot with respect to
the frame. This can permit, for example, a user to access a flexible basket disposed beneath
the seat. This flexible basket can be comprised, for example, of neoprene and can serve to
hold the user's items such as, by way of example, a purse, medication, birtoculars, reading
glasses, a water bottle, food, a cellular telephone, a portable computer, and so forth. By one
approach this flexible basket can be selectively forwardly collapsed irt order to permit the
user to position themselves further inwardly of the rollator as may be desired.
                                                 -4-

 [0026]         So configured, a roilator can be readily and intuitively customized to better
suit the stature and physical requirements of a given user. Such a rollator can also be easily
collapsed into a considerably smaller form factor that is readily lifted and stored. These
teachings can be implemented in an economical manner and can, individually or in
combination with one another, offer a considerably improved rollator experience for various
persons having a wide range of needs and/or preferences in these regards.
 [00271         These and other benefits may become clearer upon making a thorough review
and study of the following detailed description. Referring now to the drawings, and in
particular to FIGS. 1 and 2, an illustrative example of a rolling walker 100 that is compatible
with many of these teachings will now be presented.
 100281         In this illustrative example the rolling walker 100 comprises a frame 101 that
includes a first and second front leg 102 and 103 that are coupled by a brace 104. The
frame 101 also includes a first and second rear leg 105 and 106. A bracket 107 (shown as
well in FIG. 4.8) couples to both of the first and second front legs 102 and 103. This
bracket 107 has a hole disposed therethrough that serves as a pivot point for the first and
second rear legs 105 and 106, respectively. (An axle 108 of choice can be disposed through
these holes (and through a corresponding hole in the first and second rear legs 105 and 106)
to further facilitate this pivoting functionality.)
[00291          So configured, and with momentary reference to FIG. 3 as well, this frame 10 1
can fold about the aforementioned axles 108 between an unf 'Aded state as shown in FIGS. I
and 2 and a folded state as shown in part in F IG. 3. In the folded state the front legs 102
and 103 are disposed proximal to, and substantially parallel to, a corresponding rear leg 105
and 106, respectively.
100301          The frame 101 can be comprised of any desired material including plastic
and/or metal. In this example the aforementioned components 102-106 are comprised of
aluminum tubes having a generally rectangular cross section. The external corners of these
aluminum tubes are rounded to provide an aesthetically-pleasing form factor.

 [0031]         In this illustrative example a wheel assembly 109 attaches to the bottorn of
each leg 102, 103, 105, and 106. Each wheel assembly 109 includes a wheel 110 that rotates
about an axle 111. These wheels 110 can be formed of one or more appropriate materials. By
one approach the wheels 1110 can include an inflated tire. By another approach the
wheels 110 can comprise a solid material such as appropriate rubber or plastic material.
 [00321         The rear wheels 110 each rotatably couple to a corresponding leg
extension 112, These leg extensions 112, in this illustrative exarnple, comprise aluminum
tubes that are sized to conformably fit within the rear legs 105 and 106. Generally speaking,
the leg extensions 112 can be sized to slide back and forth within the rear legs 105 and 106
without requiring more than a modicum of strength while nevertheless not being so small as
to, for example, rattle loosely within the rear legs 105 and 106 during use.
 [00331         Also in this illustrative example the rear legs 105 and 106 each include a
plurality of spaced openings 113 that are sized to accommodate a user-accessible spring
biased push button 114 that comprises a part of the leg extensions 112. These openings 113
can be spaced, for example, at a desired regular distance such as one inch, two inches, or
some other distance of choice. So configured, the effective length of the rear legs 105
and 106 can be varied to accommodate users having different heights. The user-accessible
push buttons 114 are disposed outwardly of the frame 101 and hence are readily observed
and their purpose intuitively understood by even an untrained observer. The leg
extensions 112 for these rear legs 105 and 106 each also include a lower portion 118 that is
substantially parallel to the aforementioned legs 105 and 106 but laterally and outwardly
offset therefrom.
[00341          In this illustrative example the front wheel assemblies 109 are configured
somewhat differently from the rear wheel assemblies 109. The front wheel assemblies 109
include a corresponding leg extension 115 that again includes a user-accessible spring-biased
push button 116 that can be secured within one of a plurality of corresponding openings 117
in the first and second front legs 102 and 103. These leg extensions 115 for the front wheel
assemblies 109, however, are not laterally of fset from the legs 102 and 103 themselves.
                                                -6  -

 Instead, these leg extensions 115 simply angle downwardly somewhat and then rotatably
couple to a fork 119 that holds the wheel's axle 111.
 [0035]          So configured, the effective length of the front legs 102 and 103 can again be
easily and selectively varied to accommodate users of varying statues. The ability of the
front wheels 110 to rotate about a vertical axis, in turn, improves the steerability of the
rolling walker 100. Referring again momentarily to FIG. 3, the offset nature of the rear wheel
assembles allows the front wheels to be stowed in a nested fashion with respect to the rear
wheels and hence permits the rolling walker 100 to be f olded into arelatively small form
factor to thereby permit the folded rolling walker 100 to be more easily hefted, manipulated,
and stored in a limited space. More particularly, the front and rear wheels 110 become
positioned adjacent one another in corresponding pairs where the wheels 110 as comprise
each pair are disposed and oriented nearly coaxial to one another.
 [0036]         Referring again to FIGS, I and 2 along with FIGS. 4.1 and 4,2, this rolling
walker 100 also includes a seat 120. This seat 120 includes a seat frame 121 that couples via
pivot points 122 to the front legs 102 and 103 of the frame 101. So configured, the seat
frame 1121 can pivot upwardly with respect to the front legs 102 and 103 of the frame 10 1 to
facilitate folding the frame 101 into the collapsed state.
[00371          Referring to FIGS. 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, the seat frame 121 further includes side
members 124 disposed on either side of the seat frame 121. T bese side members 124, in turn,
each have a slot 123 formed therein, This slot 123 is essentially L-shaped, with the short leg
of the slot 123 exiendingupwardly near the rear edge of the seat frame 121. In this
illustrative example rods 125 (best shown in FIG. 4.3) that couple to the rear legs 105
and 106 extend into (and can be captivated within, if desired) these slots 123. So configured,
this rod 125 provides vertical support to the non-pivoting end of the seat frame 121 when the
frame 10 1 is fully unfolded while also serving to guide the seat frame 121 into the
appropriate position when folding the frame 12 L The rod 125 is of suf ficient size and
strength to support a portion of the weight of the user when the user sits upon the seat 120.
[0038]          With reference in particular to FIGS. 2 and 4.1, the seat frame 121 can further
comprise a handle 126. So configured, a user can grip the handle 126 to facilitate f "Ading the
                                                - 7-

rolling walker 100 into a collapsed state. In particular, gripping this handle 126 and pulling
upwardly will cause the aforementioned rods 125 to move along the aforementioned
slots 123 while the seat frame 121 pivots around the aforementioned pivot points 122 as the
frame 101 folds inwardly to the above-described collapsed state.
 [00391         A user-support surface 127 is disposed atop the seat frame 121. By oue
approach the user-support surface 127 pivotally couples proximal to the front edge of the seat
frame 121. With particular reference to FIGS. 4.1 and 4.2, by one approach the user-support
surface 127 connects via two curved hinge members 404 that move selectively in and out of
the seat frame 121 via corresponding slots 405. By one approach these curved binge
members 404 are frictionally engaged by corresponding surfaces (not shown) in the seat
frame 121 such that the user-support surface 127 is maintained at any angle at which the user
may leave the user-support surface 127. So configured, the user-support surface 127 can
selectively pivot upwardly with respect to the seat frame 121.
 [0040]         By one approach a latch mechanism 406 can serve to hold the user-support
surface 127 in the fully-closed position. With reference in particular to FIGS. 4.1, 4.1 a, and
4.4, this latch mechanism 406 can comprise, for example, a latch handle 407 that attaches to
a pair of rods 408 such that pivoting of the latch handle 407 will cause the rods 408 to rotate
about their longitudinal axis as well. The ends of these rods 408 each terminate at a
catch 409. This catch 409 includes an indented portion (410 as shown, for example, in
FIG. 4.1 a) that interacts with an edge lip 411 (as marked in FIG. 4.1) on the rear of the seat
frame 121. By one approach the latch mechanism 406 can be spring biased towards a
position that will serve to bold the catch 409 in an engagement state with the edge lip 4 11
unless and until the user overcomes that biasing by manipulating the aforementioned latch
handle 407. So configured, the user-support surface 127 will remain latched and closed
unless and until the user manipulates the latch handle 407 to unhook the catch 409 and
thereby permit the user-support surface 127 to be pivoted open as described above.
[0041]          By one approach, and referring to FIG. 4.1, the seat frame 121 can include an
upper surface 401 having various features formed therein. These features can include, for
example, an indented tray 402, a cupholder 403, and so forth as desired. So configured, these
                                               -8-

features become visible and accessible to a user of the rolling walker 100 when the user
support surface 127 is pivoted upwardly but otherwise remain hidden from view and are
inaccessible when the user-support surface 127 is in the horizontal, latched position.
100421          If desired, and referring now to FIGS. 4.4 and 4.5, the underside 412 of the
user-support surface 127 can have, for example, hooks-and-loops 413 disposed thereon to
grip and hold, for example, a zippered container 414 (as shown in FIG. 4.4). So configured
the zippered container 414 can be readily secured to, and removed from, the underside 412 of
the user-support surface 127. Such a zippered container 414 can serve, for example, as a
wallet or small purse if desired. Such a zippered container 414 can also serve to conveniently
store such things as small tools, medicines, a snack or drink, and so forth as desired.
100431          These teachings will also accommodate, if desired, disposing a flexible
basket 128 beneath the seat assembly 120. This flexible basket 128 can be comprised, for
example, of a neoprene material of choice and can be supported by the f-rame 101. So
configured, the flexible basket 128 cart serve to receive and hold any of a variety of user
items such as items of clothing, food or drink, communications devices, magazines, medicine
or other related supplies, and so forth.
100441          By one approach this flexible basket 128 can be configured to collapse
forwardly when desired. With reference to FIGS. 4.1, 4.2, 4.6, and. 4.7, the rearward
edge 415 of the flexible basket 128 can include a rod having its ends disposed within a
corresponding track 416 f rmed on an inner surface of the seat frame 12 L As denoted by the
white arrow in FIG. 4.6, such a configuration will permit the rearward edge 415 of the
flexible basket 128 to be moved back and forth along that track 416. This capability, in turn,
permits a user to move that rearward edge 415 forward (as shown in FIG. 4.7) until the
flexible basket 128 is essentially vertically collapsed.
[0045]          Moving the flexible basket 128 to a vertically-collapsed state as described.
above, in turn, opens up a space (417 as illustrated in FIG. 4.2) that will permit the user to
move forwardly within the ambit of the rollator 100 as shown in FIG. 4.8. In particular, the
user 418 is able to move further forwardly within the frame 101 of the rollator 100 when the
user-support surface 127 is pivoted upwardly and forwardly as described above and when the
                                               -9-

flexible basket 128 is vertically collapsed as described above. This flexibility regarding the
position of the user with respect to the rollator 100 can serve to better accommodate a range
of application settings, user preferences, and so forth.
 100461          Generally speaking, the aforementioned user-support surface 127 serves, at
least in part, to support a sitting person. Accordingly, this user-support surface 127 will
permit a walking or standing user to rest in a sitting position as desired.
 [0047]          With reference to FIGS. I and 2, by one approach the rolling walker 100 can
further comprise a backrest 129. In this illustrative example the frame 101 supports this
backrest 129. This backrest 129 can be comprised, for example, of a flexible material such
as, but not limited to, memory foam material and neoprene.
 100481          In this illustrative example, the opposing ends of the backrest 129 connect to
corresponding rotating strap holders 130. If desired, and as shown, these rotating strap
holders 130 can be configured to provide an elbow support surface 131 to a person sitting on
the seat 120. Because these strap holders 130 can rotate about their vertical axis, the
backrest 129 can, in turn, selectively move between one position that provides back support
for a person sitting in the seat 120 facing in a rearward direction (as shown in FIG. I) and
another position that provides back support for a person sitting in the seat 120 facing in a
forward direction (as shown in FIG. 5).
[00491           By one approach, the user can move the backrest 129 between these two
backrest orientations by simply grasping the backrest 129 (near, for example, the center
thereof) and pulling the backrest 129 towards the desired orientation, When the backrest 129
comprises flexible material, the backrest 129 will readily follow such an action and the
rotating strap holders 130 will freely rotate to permit the backrest 129 to reach the opposing
orientation.
[0050]           When the backrest 129 comprises a material having some resiliency (in
addition to the af orementioned flexibility), the backrest 129 will further serve to bias the
backrest 129 towards the first position noted above when the backrest 129 is, in fact, in that
position, and will also serve to bias the backrest 129 towards the second position noted above
                                                 -- 10 --

when the backrest 129 is, in fact, in that second position. Such a configuration will help
retain the backrest 129 in a desired state of deployment and available and ready for service.
 [oo51]         If desired, this backrest 129 can be vertically adjusted in height. By one
approach, and referring to FIG. 6, the upper portion of the strap holders 130 can rotatably
couple to a vertical rod 601. These vertical rods 601, in turn, can have a plurality of
holes 602 disposed therethrough and sized to receive a pin 603 as comprises a part of a
vertical adjustment user interface. This vertical adjustment user interface can further
comprise a button 604 that attaches perpendicularly to one end of the pin 603 and provides a
simple mechanism by which the user can selectively manipulate the vertical adjustment user
interface to permit the vertical rod 601 to move selectively up and down to a desired position
and to then lock the vertical rod 601 at the desired height by moving the pin 603 into a
corresponding one of the aforementioned holes 602. A housing 605 can serve to retain and
guide at least a portion of the pin 603 and can also include a spring (not shown) to bias the
pin 603 inwardly towards the interior of the frame 101.
 [0052]         So configured, a user can readily determine the means by which the
backrest 129 can be moved to a different height. The described approach is also simple and
intuitive to employ in these same regards.
[00531          This rolling walker 100 can also include, if desired, handles 132 that are
supported by the frame 10 1 and that provide hand-graspable surfaces 133 to facilitate a user
using the rolling walker 100 in the unfiolded state to aid in maintaining their balance when
walking or standing. By one approach, and referring momentarily to FIGS. 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4,
a portion of each handle 132 can be sized and configured to slide in and out of a housing 135.
If desired, a collar 705 can have one or more keys 703 formed therein to mate with
corresponding slots 704 that are formed in the aforementioned handle 132. So configured,
the handle 132 will slide in and out of the collar 705 without also rotating with respect to the
collar 705.
[0054]           A hand-operated push button 134 (FIG. 7.3) can serve to lock each handle 132
at a particular desired point of extension. This push button 134 can be spring biased towards
and can connect to a locking pin 706 (FIG. 7.4) that in turn enters a given hole 707 as
                                               - 11 -

provided along the length of the handle 132 to thereby lock the handle 132 with respect to
the collar 705, So configured the user can easily change the height of the hand-graspable
surfaces 133 to accommodate their own physical needs and preferences
 100551         If desired, another latch mechanism 708 can serve as a handle-rotation user
interface that permits the user to selectively rotate the handles 132 between a deployed state
(as shown in FIGS. I and 2) where the hand-graspable surfaces 133 are disposed rearwardly
of the rolling walker 100 and an undeployed state where the hand-graspable surfaces 133
face at least substantially inwardly towards one another, With the hand-graspable
surfaces 133 so disposed, and as generally suggested by the schematic illustration provided at
FIG. 7.1, the handles 132, including the hand-graspable surfaces 133, are disposed within the
vertical confines 702 of an envelope 70 1 defined by remaining components of the rolling
walker 100 when the rolling walker 100 is folded into its undeployed, collapsed state. This,
in turn, prevents the handles 132 from requiring more vertical storage space than the rolling
walker 100 would otherwise require when stored flat.
 [0056]         Referring to FIGS. 7,5 and 7.6, this latch mechanism 708 can include a paddle
surface 709 that a user can assert downwardly as shown in FIG. 7.6. This movement, in turn,
can serve to disengage interlocking members with respect to the latch mechanism 708 and
the aforementioned collar 705. With reference to FIG. 7.7, this disengagement can in turn
permit the collar 705 to rotate as denoted by the curved arrow, either clockwise or
counterclockwise as desired. Since the handle 132 connects to the collar 705 as described
above, rotation of the collar 705 will cause a like rotation of the handle 132 as well to
thereby permit the hand--graspable surfaces 133 to be aligned as desired. By one approach the
collar 705 can be configured to so rotate between two lockable positions (corresponding to
the deployed and collapsed states of the rollator 100 as a whole), where both lockable
positions can be unlocked by the aforemerntioned downward movement of the latch
mechanism 708.
[0057]          Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 8, the rolling walker 100 can farther comprise a
hand-operated braking system. This can include a hand-graspable actuator 136 located
proximal the aforementioned hand-graspable surfaces 133 of the handles 132. Pulling this
                                               - 12 -

actuator 136 upwardly, for example, can cause a wire 801 to pull up on a pivoting
mernber 139 that causes a brake element 802 to come into frictional contact with a
corresponding wheel 110. Such brake mechanisms are generally well known in the art and
require no further elaboration here except to note that, if desired, the hand--graspable
actuator 136 can be configured to lock in the brake--applied configuration by moving the
hand--graspable actuator 136 away from the hand--graspable surf ace 133. In such a case, the
locked--state can be released by, for example, pulling upwardly again on the hand-graspable
actuator 136.
 [0058]           This basic approach to a rolling walker design will accommodate any of a
wide variety of alterations and/or embellishments, As but one simple example in these
regards, one or more cupholders of choice can be attached thereto as desired. As one specific
example in these regards, but without intending any particular limitations in these regards, a
collapsible cupholder 900 as shown in FIGS. I and 9-41 can be attached, for exarnple, to one
ofi the legs ofi such a rolling walker 100. Such a cupholder 900 can have a main body 901
(comprised, for example, of a suitable plastic material) configured to attach to a desired
surface on the rolling walker 100. A tray component 902 and a corresponding retainer
component 903 (formed, for example, of metal or plastic) can be pivotally coupled to the
main body 901 and can be flexibly joined to one another by a bridge piece 904 (as shown in
FIG, 11). So configured the tray component 902 and retainer component 903 can be pivoted
(jointly) to a collapsed configuration as shown in FIG. 9 or positioned instead in a deployed
configuration as shown in FIG. 10. Such a collapsible cupholder 900 afitbrds the user the
opportunity to have and utilize a convenient cupholder when needed and to collapse the
cupholder 900 into a smaller--sized form factor when not needed to reduce the overall profile
and size of the rolling walker 100.
[00591           These various teachings described herein can be used alone or in various
combinations as desired, The resultant rolling walker will benefit accordingly. More
particularly, a rolling walker that comports with these teachings can be made relatively
inexpensively while providing superior usability and functionality. Various dimensions are
readily modified to suit the particular physical circumstances of a given user. Furthermore.
                                                 -- 13 -

the mechanisms by/ which such modifications are effected are simple to discern, understand,
and operate. These teachings also permit a rolling walker to be collapsed into a very small
package that can be more easily handled and stored.
[0060]          Those skilled in the art will recognize that a wide variety of modifications,
alterations, and combinations cai be made with respect to the above described embodiments
without departing from the scope of the invention, and that such modifications, alterations,
and combinations are to be viewed as being within the ambit of the inventive concept, In
these regards, an appendix as is attached hereto and made a part hereof includes a number of
views as correspond to many such possibilities.
