           INFORMATION TRANSMISSION METHOD, BASE
                       STATION, AND USER EQUIPMENT
                                     TECHNICAL FIELD
   [0001]       This application relates to the field of communications technologies, and in
 5 particular, to an information transmission method, a base station, and user equipment.
                                        BACKGROUND
   [0002]       Resources in a Long Term Evolution (Long Term Evolution, LTE) or Long
   Term Evolution Advanced (Long Term Evolution Advanced, LTE-A) system are
   divided into radio frames (which are also referred to as system frames) in time. One
10 radio frame includes 10 subframes, a length of one subframe is 1 ms, and one
   subframe includes two timeslots. Radio frames are numbered from 0 to 1023, and
   subframes of each radio frame are numbered from 0 to 9. For a normal cyclic prefix
   (Cyclic Prefix, CP), each timeslot includes seven symbols, and for an extended CP,
   each timeslot includes six symbols. The resources are divided into subcarriers in
15 frequency. One physical resource block (Physical Resource Block, PRB) is defined as
   one timeslot in time and 12 subcarriers in frequency.
   [0003]       In the LTE or LTE-A system, system information is classified into a master
   information block (Master Information Block, MIB) and a system information block
   (System Information Block, SIB).
20 [0004]       Generally, the MIB is carried on a physical broadcast channel (Physical
   Broadcast Channel, PBCH). In the existing LTE or LTE-A system, the PBCH is
   mapped to four consecutive radio frames, and a period is 40 ms. A start point of the
   radio frames to which the PBCH is mapped meets SFN mod 4            =  0, where SFN is a
   number of the radio frame, and mod () is a modulo operation. The PBCH is mapped to
25 the first four symbols in the second timeslot of a subframe 0, and occupies middle six
   PRBs in system bandwidth, that is, occupies middle 72 subcarriers. A schematic
   diagram in a case of a normal CP is shown in FIG. 1.
   [0005]       There are multiple types of SIBs, which are mainly a SIB 1, a SIB2,

   and a SIB16. A sending period of the SIBI is 80 ms, that is, eight radio frames, a start
   location of each period is a radio frame whose SFN mod 8     =  0, and repeated sending
   is performed in subframes 5 in radio frames whose radio frame numbers meet SFN
   mod 2   = 0 in 80 ms, that is, repeated sending is performed every 20 ms. Other types
 5 of SIBs are included in several system information (System Information, SI) messages
   according to different scheduling requirements (such as periods). Each type of SIB is
   included in one SI message, and only SIBs with a same period can be included in one
   SI message. An SI message is allowed to be sent within specific duration in time, and
   the duration is referred to as an SI window. A transmission period of an SI message, a
10 length of an SI window, and a mapping relationship between another type of SIB and
   an SI message are dynamically scheduled by using the SIB1. In each subframe for
   transmitting a SIB, the SIB is carried on a physical downlink shared channel (Physical
   Downlink Shared Channel, PDSCH), and is scheduled by using downlink control
   information (Downlink Control Information, DCI) carried on a physical downlink
15 control channel (Physical Downlink Control Channel, PDCCH), that is, a frequency
   resource, an encoding rate, and the like used in SIB transmission are configured.
   [0006]      In the LTE or LTE-A system, user equipment (User Equipment, UE) needs
   to establish a connection to a network, and this process is generally referred to as a
   random access process. In the first step of the random access process, the UE sends a
20 random access preamble to a base station. After detecting the random access
   preamble, the base station sends a random access response (Random Access
   Response, RAR) to the UE. The RAR is sent in any subframe in a random access
   response window. In a subframe for sending the RAR, the RAR is carried on a
   PDSCH, and the PDSCH is also scheduled by using DCI carried on a PDCCH.
25 [0007]      In the LTE or LTE-A system, a network needs to page (paging)
   corresponding UE, for UEs in an idle mode (Idle mode) when a service of the UE
   arrives, or for UEs in an idle mode or a connected mode when a system message
   needs to be changed or when an earthquake and tsunami warning service or a
   commercial mobile alert service is to be performed. A time resource for sending a
30 paging message to the UE by the base station is determined according to a paging
   occasion (paging occasion, PO) and a paging frame (paging frame, PF). One PF is one
   radio frame and includes one or more POs. One PO is one subframe, and the base
   station sends a paging message in this subframe. The PO and the PF are calculated
   according to a formula specified in a protocol.
                                               2

   [0008]      In a subframe for sending a paging message, the paging message is carried
   on a PDSCH, and the PDSCH is scheduled by using DCI carried on a PDCCH.
   [0009]      The MIB, the SIB, the RAR, and the paging message may be referred to as
   public messages. The PDSCH is further used to carry unicast data in addition to the
 5 public messages, and the unicast data may also be referred to as dedicated data of UE.
   In the existing LTE or LTE-A system, regardless of whether the PDSCH carries the
   public message or the unicast data, the PDSCH always needs to be scheduled by using
   DCI carried on a PDCCH.
   [0010]      When a machine type communication (machine type communication,
10 MTC) service is supported in the LTE or LTE-A system, coverage of an LTE or
   LTE-A network needs to be enhanced to send information in the LTE or LTE-A
   network in an enhanced manner, which ensures that UE in a basement or with poor
   channel quality can reliably communicate with the base station.
   [0011]      In the prior art, a method for sending a MIB in an enhanced manner is
15 repeatedly sending a MIB in an existing system in a period of 40 ms. A MIB sent in
   an enhanced manner is referred to as enhanced sending of the MIB (or a PBCH burst,
   an enhanced MIB, or an enhanced PBCH). In the period of 40 ms, a manner of
   sending a MIB in an enhanced manner may be one of the following options: 1. An
   existing MIB is repeatedly sent only in subframes 0, and other symbols in the
20 subframes 0 than the first four symbols in the second timeslots may be occupied for
   enhanced sending of the MIB. 2. The existing MIB is repeatedly sent in subframes 5
   in odd radio frames and subframes 0. 3. The existing MIB is repeatedly sent in
   subframes 0 and another subframe in each of all radio frames. 4. The existing MIB is
   repeatedly sent in subframes 0 and three other subframes in each of all radio frames. A
25 period of 40 ms for sending a MIB in an enhanced manner is one of the following
   options: A. The MIB is sent in an enhanced manner in each period of 40 ms. B. The
   base station decides whether the MIB is sent in an enhanced manner in a period of 40
   ms, and the base station may dynamically choose whether to send the MIB in an
   enhanced manner. C. It is decided, based on a predefined pattern, whether to send the
30 MIB in an enhanced manner in a period of 40 ms, where the predefined pattern
   specifies that among several consecutive periods of 40 ms, the MIB is sent in an
   enhanced manner in which period of 40 ms, and the MIB is not sent in an enhanced
   manner in which period of 40 ms. The MIB is also sent in an enhanced manner on
   middle six PRBs in system bandwidth, that is, 72 subcarriers.
                                              3

   [0012]      Repeated sending is also an effective method for sending, in an enhanced
   manner, information carried on a PDSCH. When the PDSCH is used to carry a SIB, a
   method for sending the SIB in an enhanced manner is still using a SIB type in an
   existing system. A subframe for sending the SIB in an enhanced manner is the same as
 5 an existing subframe for sending the SIB, and a change cycle of the SIB is prolonged.
   In a change cycle of a SIB, the base station sends same SIBs in subframes for sending
   a SIB, so that UE can accumulate these same SIBs to improve performance.
   Alternatively, a new subframe is defined to send an existing SIB in an enhanced
   manner, the newly defined subframe is different from the existing subframe for
10 sending the SIB, and the SIB is repeatedly sent in the newly defined subframe.
   Another method for enhancing the SIB is defining a new SIB for UE in a basement or
   with poor channel quality. For example, a SIB17 or a SIBm is defined, and the new
   SIB is repeatedly sent in multiple subframes for multiple times, to ensure receiving
   performance of the UE in the basement or with poor channel quality. When the
15 PDSCH is used to carry a paging message, a method for sending the paging message
   in an enhanced manner is defining additional PF and PO resources in a new manner of
   calculating a PF and a PO, and repeatedly sending a same paging message on the
   additional PF and PO resources. When the PDSCH is used to carry an RAR or unicast
   data, repeatedly sending, in multiple subframes, a same PDSCH on which the RAR or
20 the unicast data is carried is also an effective method for enhanced sending.
   [0013]      When the information in the LTE or LTE-A network is to be sent in an
   enhanced manner, when a PDSCH is used to carry unicast data, the unicast data to be
   sent in an enhanced manner is scheduled by using DCI carried on a PDCCH. When
   the PDSCH is used to carry a public message, the public message to be sent in an
25 enhanced manner may be scheduled by using DCI carried on a PDCCH, or the public
   message is not scheduled by using DCI carried on a PDCCH, and is sent in an
   enhanced manner by using predefined parameters such as a frequency resource and an
   encoding rate.
   [0014]      When the DCI carried on the PDCCH is used to schedule the PDSCH, the
30 DCI also needs to be sent in an enhanced manner. Repeatedly sending same DCI in
   multiple subframes is an effective method for sending the DCI in an enhanced
   manner. The DCI that is repeatedly sent includes resource block allocation that is used
   to configure a frequency resource used for a PDSCH in multiple subframes.
   [0015]      However, in the prior art, in a method for sending information in an
                                                  4

   enhanced manner, because a PDSCH that carries unicast data is scheduled by using
   DCI, and several frequency resources in system bandwidth are configured by means
   of resource block allocation in the DCI, the PRB is used to send the unicast data in
   multiple subframes. The frequency resources configured by means of the resource
 5 block allocation in the DCI may overlap a frequency resource used to send a MIB in
   an enhanced manner, and among the multiple subframes for sending the unicast data
   by using the frequency resources configured by means of the resource block
   allocation in the DCI, some subframes are not subframes for sending the MIB in an
   enhanced manner, and some subframes are subframes for sending the MIB in an
10 enhanced manner. Therefore, enhanced sending of the unicast data may conflict with
   enhanced sending of the MIB. Likewise, when the PDSCH carries a public message
   and is scheduled by using the DCI, enhanced sending of the public message may
   conflict with enhanced sending of the MIB.
   [0016]      When the PDSCH carries the public message and is not scheduled by
15 using the DCI, and the public message is to be repeatedly sent in multiple subframes
   by using a predefined frequency resource, the predefined frequency resource is used
   in all the multiple subframes. The predefined frequency resource may overlap a
   frequency resource used for enhanced sending of the MIB; therefore, when the
   multiple subframes include a subframe for sending the MIB in an enhanced manner,
20 enhanced sending of the public message may conflict with the enhanced sending of
   the MIB.
   [0017]      In addition, in a case in which the base station dynamically decides
   whether a MIB is sent in an enhanced manner in a period of 40 ms, from a perspective
   of the UE, the UE does not know whether the base station sends the MIB in an
25 enhanced manner in a period of 40 ms, and therefore, does not know whether
   enhanced sending of unicast data or a public message carried on a PDSCH conflicts
   with enhanced sending of the MIB.
   [0018]      In addition, when the PDSCH is used to carry different information, in
   multiple subframes for sending information in an enhanced manner, a frequency
30 resource configured by means of resource block allocation in DCI or a predefined
   frequency resource is used to send the information in an enhanced manner. There may
   be an overlapping frequency resource between frequency resources configured or
   predefined for enhanced sending of the different information; therefore, in some
   subframes, enhanced sending of at least two types of information in a SIB, an RAR, a
                                              5

   paging message, or unicast data may conflict with each other. There may also be an
   overlapping    frequency  resource between     a frequency resource      configured or
   predefined for enhanced sending of information and a frequency resource configured
   for sending of information; therefore, in some subframes, enhanced sending of a SIB,
 5 an RAR, a paging message, or unicast data may conflict with sending of at least one
   type of the information. Enhanced sending of unicast data of different users may
   conflict with each other, or enhanced sending and sending of unicast data may also
   conflict with each other. An effective conflict resolving solution is absent from the
   prior art.

   station, and user equipment, so as to resolve a technical problem in the prior art that a
   conflict occurs in enhanced sending of information when frequency resources used for
   enhanced sending of different information overlap or when frequency resources used
15 for enhanced sending of information and sending of the information overlap.

                           DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
   [0081]      Embodiments of this application provide an information transmission
   method, a base station, and user equipment, so as to resolve a technical problem in the
10 prior art that a conflict occurs in enhanced sending of information when frequency
   resources used for enhanced sending of different information overlap or when
   frequency resources used for enhanced sending of information and sending of the
   information overlap.
   [0082]      To resolve the foregoing technical problem, a general idea of technical
15 solutions in the embodiments of this application is as follows:
   [0083]      According to an information transmission method in the embodiments of
   this application, a first frequency resource is determined, where the first frequency
   resource is a frequency resource used to send first information in an enhanced
   manner; a second frequency resource is determined, where the second frequency
20 resource is a frequency resource used to send second information or send second
   information in an enhanced manner; and when there is an overlapping frequency
   resource between the first frequency resource and the second frequency resource, in
   an available subframe for sending the first information in an enhanced manner, the
   first information is sent in an enhanced manner by using the first frequency resource,
25 where the available subframe for sending the first information in an enhanced manner
   is one or more subframes other than a subframe in a subframe set for sending the
   second information or sending the second information in an enhanced manner; or in a
   subframe in a subframe set for sending the second information or sending the second
   information in an enhanced manner, the first information is sent in an enhanced
30 manner on a frequency resource other than the overlapping frequency resource in the
   first frequency resource. Therefore, the embodiments provide two effective methods
   for avoiding a conflict when there is an overlapping frequency resource between
                                              25

   frequency resources for enhanced sending of different information or between
   frequency resources for enhanced sending of different information and sending of
   different information. When there is no overlapping frequency resource between the
   first frequency resource and the second frequency resource, in a subframe for sending
 5 the first information in an enhanced manner, the first information is sent in an
   enhanced manner by using the first frequency resource; in a subframe for sending the
   second information, the second information is sent by using the second frequency
   resource; in a subframe for sending the second information in an enhanced manner,
   the second information is sent in an enhanced manner by using the second frequency
10 resource.
   [0084]      To make the objectives, technical solutions, and advantages of the
   embodiments of this application clearer, the following clearly and completely
   describes the technical solutions in the embodiments of this application with reference
   to the accompanying drawings in the embodiments of this application. Apparently, the
15 described embodiments are merely some rather than all of the embodiments of this
   application. All other embodiments obtained by a person of ordinary skill in the art
   based on the embodiments of this application without creative efforts shall fall within
   the protection scope of this application.
   [0085]      This specification describes various aspects with reference to user
20 equipment and/or a base station.
   [0086]      The user equipment may be a wireless terminal or may be a wired
   terminal. The wireless terminal may refer to a device that provides voice and/or data
   connectivity for a user, a handheld device with a radio connection function, or another
   processing device connected to a radio modem. The wireless terminal may
25 communicate with one or more core networks by using a radio access network (such
   as RAN, Radio Access Network). The wireless terminal may be a mobile terminal
   such as a mobile phone (or referred to as a "cellular" phone) or a computer with a
   mobile terminal, for example, may be a portable, pocket-sized, handheld, computer
   built-in, or in-vehicle mobile apparatus, which exchanges voice and/or data with the
30 radio access network, for example, a device such as a personal communications
   service (PCS, Personal Communication Service) phone, a cordless telephone set, a
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phone, a wireless local loop (WLL, Wireless Local
   Loop) station, a personal digital assistant (PDA, Personal Digital Assistant), or a
   meter that has a function of automatically reading water/electricity/gas. The wireless
                                              26

   terminal may also be referred to as a system, a subscriber unit (Subscriber Unit), a
   subscriber station (Subscriber Station), a mobile station (Mobile Station), a mobile
   station (Mobile), a remote station (Remote Station), an access point (Access Point), a
   remote terminal (Remote Terminal), an access terminal (Access Terminal), a user
 5 terminal (User Terminal), a user agent (User Agent), user device (User Device), or
   user equipment (User Equipment).
   [0087]      The base station (for example, an access point) may refer to a device that is
   in an access network and communicates, over an air interface, with the wireless
   terminal by using one or more sectors. The base station may be configured to
10 mutually convert a received over-the-air frame and an IP packet and serve as a router
   between the wireless terminal and a remaining portion of the access network, where
   the remaining portion of the access network may include an Internet Protocol (IP)
   network. The base station may further coordinate attribute management of the air
   interface. For example, the base station may be a base transceiver station (Base
15 Transceiver Station, BTS) in GSM, or may be a NodeB (NodeB) in UTMS, or may be
   an evolved NodeB (NodeB or eNB or e-NodeB, evolved Node B) in LTE or LTE-A,
   which is not limited in this application.
   [0088]      The term "and/or" in this specification describes only an association
   relationship for describing associated objects and represents that three relationships
20 may exist. For example, A and/or B may represent the following three cases: Only A
   exists, both A and B exist, and only B exists. In addition, the character "/" in this
   specification generally indicates an "or" relationship between the associated objects.
   [0089]      The following describes implementation manners of this application in
   details with reference to the accompanying drawings.
25                                      Embodiment 1
   [0090]      This embodiment provides an information transmission method. Referring
   to FIG. 2, FIG. 2 is a flowchart of the information transmission method in this
   embodiment. The method includes:
   [0091]      Step 101: Determine a first frequency resource, where the first frequency
30 resource is a frequency resource used to send first information in an enhanced manner.
   [0092]      Step 102: Determine a second frequency resource, where the second
   frequency resource is a frequency resource used to send second information or send
                                               27

   second information in an enhanced manner.
   [0093]      When there is an overlapping frequency resource between the first
   frequency resource and the second frequency resource, step 103 or step 104 is
   performed.
 5 [0094]      Step 103: Send, in an available subframe for sending the first information
   in an enhanced manner, the first information in an enhanced manner by using the first
   frequency resource, where the available subframe for sending the first information in
   an enhanced manner is one or more subframes other than a subframe in a subframe set
   for sending the second information or sending the second information in an enhanced
10 manner.
   [0095]      Step 104: Send, in a subframe in a subframe set for sending the second
   information or sending the second information in an enhanced manner, the first
   information in an enhanced manner on a frequency resource other than the
   overlapping frequency resource in the first frequency resource.
15 [0096]      Step 101 and step 102 may be performed at the same time or may be
   performed sequentially. Further, manners of determining the first frequency resource
   and the second frequency resource in step 101 and step 102 may be the same or may
   be different, which generally depends on information types of the first information
   and the second information. For example, a possible implementation manner is as
20 follows: A base station determines the first frequency resource and/or the second
   frequency resource according to scheduling of the base station, then sends or sends, in
   an enhanced manner, DCI carried on a physical downlink control channel (Physical
   Downlink Control Channel, PDCCH), and notifies UE of the determined first
   frequency resource and/or the determined second frequency resource by means of
25 resource block allocation in the DCI; or a base station determines the first frequency
   resource and/or the second frequency resource in a predefined manner, where the
   predefined manner may be protocol agreement.
   [0097]      When there is an overlapping frequency resource between the first
   frequency resource and the second frequency resource, for example, if the first
30 frequency resource is totally 36 subcarriers from the           0 th subcarrier to the 3 5th
   subcarrier, and the second frequency resource is totally 23 subcarriers from the        0 th
   subcarrier to the 2 2 "dsubcarrier, there is an overlapping frequency resource of totally
   23 subcarriers from the      0 th subcarrier to the   2 2 "d subcarrier  between the first
   frequency resource and the second frequency resource, the first information may be
                                                 28

   sent in an enhanced manner in a manner in step 103 or step 104, and on the second
   frequency resource, the second information may be sent or the second information
   may be sent in an enhanced manner.
   [0098]      In step 103, in the available subframe for sending the first information in
 5 an enhanced manner, the first information is sent in an enhanced manner by using the
   first frequency resource, where the available subframe for sending the first
   information in an enhanced manner is the one or more subframes other than the
   subframe in the subframe set for sending the second information or sending the
   second information in an enhanced manner. That is, in a subframe for sending the
10 second information or sending the second information in an enhanced manner, the
   second information is sent or the second information is sent in an enhanced manner by
   using the second frequency resource; and in the subframe in the subframe set for
   sending the second information or sending the second information in an enhanced
   manner, the first information is not sent in an enhanced manner. The subframe set for
15 sending the second information or sending the second information in an enhanced
   manner includes the subframe for sending the second information or sending the
   second information in an enhanced manner.
   [0100]      Further, in step 103, in the subframe in the subframe set for sending the
   second information or sending the second information in an enhanced manner, at least
20 one subframe is a subframe within duration for sending the first information in an
   enhanced manner, where the duration for sending the first information in an enhanced
   manner is a period for sending the first information in an enhanced manner or
   duration between a start subframe for sending the first information in an enhanced
   manner and an end subframe for sending the first information in an enhanced manner.
25 That is, the duration for sending the first information in an enhanced manner includes
   the at least one subframe in the subframe set for sending the second information or
   sending the second information in an enhanced manner, and in one or more other
   subframes than the subframe in the subframe set for sending the second information
   or sending the second information in an enhanced manner, in all subframes included
30 in the duration for sending the first information in an enhanced manner, the first
   information is sent in an enhanced manner by using the first frequency resource. In
   this way, when the first information is to be sent in an enhanced manner, a period of
   time in which no second information is to be sent or sent in an enhanced manner does
   not need to be found to send the first information in an enhanced manner. The
                                                29

   duration for sending the first information in an enhanced manner may be selected
   without considering completely avoiding a time location of the second information,
   provided that a subframe for the second information is avoided within the duration.
   [0101]      In step 104, in the subframe in the subframe set for sending the second
 5 information or sending the second information in an enhanced manner, the first
   information is sent in an enhanced manner on the frequency resource other than the
   overlapping frequency resource in the first frequency resource. That is, the second
   frequency resource is used normally, to send the second information in a subframe for
   sending the second information, or send, in an enhanced manner, the second
10 information in a subframe for sending the second information in an enhanced manner;
   however, if a subframe for sending the first information in an enhanced manner is also
   a subframe in the subframe set for sending the second information or sending the
   second information in an enhanced manner, in the subframe in the subframe set for
   sending the second information or sending the second information in an enhanced
15 manner, the first information is sent in an enhanced manner on the frequency resource
   other than the overlapping frequency resource in the first frequency resource, and in
   other words, the first information is not sent in an enhanced manner on the
   overlapping frequency resource; in a subframe, other than the subframe in the
   subframe set for sending the second information or sending the second information in
20 an enhanced manner, in the subframe for sending the first information in an enhanced
   manner, the first information is sent by using the first frequency resource normally.
   [0102]      For example, in the subframe in the subframe set for sending the second
   information or sending the second information in an enhanced manner, if the first
   frequency resource is totally 36 subcarriers from the                0 th  subcarrier to the    3 5th
25 subcarrier, and the second frequency resource is totally 23 subcarriers from the                  0 th
   subcarrier to the  2 2 "dsubcarrier,   the first information is sent in an enhanced manner
   on totally 13 subcarriers from the       2 3 rd subcarrier to the 3 5 th  subcarrier other than an
   overlapping frequency resource of totally 23 subcarriers from the             0 th subcarrier to the
   2 2nd subcarrier; that is, the first information is not sent in an enhanced manner on the
30 overlapping frequency resource of totally 23 subcarriers from the             0 th subcarrier to the
   2 2nd subcarrier.
   [0103]      Further, step 104 may be further specifically: sending, in the subframe in
   the subframe set for sending the second information or sending the second
   information in an enhanced manner, the first information in an enhanced manner on
                                                     30

   an available physical resource block (Physical Resource Block, PRB) for the first
   information, where the available PRB for the first information is specifically a PRB,
   other than a PRB on which the overlapping frequency resource is located, in PRBs on
   which the first frequency resource is located. For example, the foregoing first
 5 frequency resource and the foregoing second frequency resource are still used as
   examples for description. If the first frequency resource is totally 36 subcarriers from
   the 0 th subcarrier to the  3 5th subcarrier, and the second frequency resource is totally 23
   subcarriers from the     0 th  subcarrier to the      2 2 "d subcarrier,  for one timeslot of one
   subframe, assuming that PRBs on which the first frequency resource is located are
10 totally three PRBs from the        0 th PRB to the    2 "dPRB,   and PRBs on which the second
   frequency resource is located are totally two PRBs from the                0 th PRB to the 1" PRB,
   that is, the PRBs on which the overlapping frequency resource is located are the same
   as the PRBs on which the second frequency resource is located, in one timeslot of the
   subframe in the subframe set for sending the second information or sending the
15 second information in an enhanced manner, the first information is sent in an
   enhanced manner on one PRB, other than the two PRBs on which the overlapping
   frequency resource is located, in the three PRBs on which the first frequency resource
   is located, that is, the first information is sent in an enhanced manner on the second
   PRB, and in terms of subcarrier, the first information is sent in an enhanced manner
20 on totally 12 subcarriers from the       2 4 th subcarrier to the 3 5 th subcarrier. In other words,
   the first information is not sent in an enhanced manner on the PRB on which the
   overlapping frequency resource is located.
   [0104]       In actual application, a manner of sending the first information in an
   enhanced manner on the available PRB for the first information includes but is not
25 limited to the following two sending manners.
   [0105]       In a first manner, the sending the first information in an enhanced manner
   on the available PRB for the first information includes: determining, according to a
   quantity of PRBs on which the first frequency resource is located, a quantity of all
   available bits for one transport block of the first information; selecting a sending bit of
30 the transport block of the first information according to the quantity of all available
   bits for the transport block; and mapping a modulation symbol of the first information
   to a resource element (Resource Element, RE) included in the PRB on which the first
   frequency resource is located, and when a first RE in the RE is included in the PRB
   on which the overlapping frequency resource is located, discarding a modulation
                                                      31

   symbol corresponding to the first RE. The first sending manner may be also referred
   to as enhanced sending of the first information in a manner of puncturing the PRB on
   which the overlapping frequency resource is located.
   [0106]       In a second manner, the sending the first information in an enhanced
 5 manner on the available PRB for the first information includes: determining,
   according to a quantity of available PRBs for the first information, a quantity of all
   available bits for one transport block of the first information; selecting a sending bit of
   the transport block of the first information according to the quantity of all available
   bits for the transport block; and mapping a modulation symbol of the first information
10 to a resource element RE included in the available PRB for the first information. The
   second sending manner may be also referred to as enhanced sending of the first
   information in a manner of performing rate matching on the PRB on which the
   overlapping frequency resource is located.
   [0107]       In the first manner and the second manner, assuming that the quantity of
15 all available bits for the transport block of the first information is H, selecting the
   sending bit of the transport block of the first information according to the quantity H
   of all available bits for the transport block may be specifically as follows: 1. Calculate
   a quantity E,' of sending bits of one code block of one transport block of the first
   information according to H: if r           C -7-1     E,'= N x      x LG'V Cj; otherwise,
    Er '= N   x     x FGl'C]
20                 I,          where r is a sequence number of the code block, C is a
   quantity of code blocks obtained by performing code block segmentation on the
   transport block,      LI    indicates   rounding down,     V 1 indicates rounding up,
    r=  G'mod C, mod indicates a modulo operation, G'=H / (NL xn)               NL   2 when
   transmit diversity is used, and in another case, NL is equal to a quantity of layers to
25 which the transport block is mapped, and Q-             is an order corresponding to a
   modulation scheme. 2. Select the sending bit of the code block of the one transport
   block of the first information, where a quantity of selected bits is E,'. 3. Cascade
   selected sending bits of multiple code blocks of the transport block of the first
   information to obtain the selected sending bit of the one transport block of the first
30 information. The modulation symbol of the first information may be obtained by
                                                 32

   modulating the sending bit of the one transport block of the first information.
   [0108]      Further, in actual application, the first information may be specifically at
   least one of unicast data, a system information block (System Information Block, SIB),
   or a random access response (Random Access Response, RAR), and the second
 5 information is specifically a master information block (Master Information Block,
   MIB); or the first information is specifically a random access response RAR, and the
   second information is specifically a system information block SIB; or the first
   information is specifically a paging message, and the second information is
   specifically a system information block and/or a random access response RAR; or the
10 first information is specifically unicast data, and the second information is specifically
   at least one of a system information block, a random access response RAR, or a
   paging message; or the first information is specifically first unicast data, and the
   second information is specifically second unicast data, where the first unicast data and
   the second unicast data are different unicast data.
15 [0109]      The following separately describes a specific implementation process of
   the information transmission method in this embodiment by using several specific
   instances.
   [0110]      In a first implementation form, in this embodiment, for example, the first
   information is specifically at least one of unicast data, a system information block SIB,
20 or a random access response RAR, and the second information is a master information
   block MIB.
   [0111]      In step 101 and step 102, the base station determines the first frequency
   resource used to send the first information in an enhanced manner, and determines the
   second frequency resource used to send the second information or send the second
25 information in an enhanced manner. Specifically, the first frequency resource used to
   send the at least one of the unicast data, the SIB, or the RAR in an enhanced manner
   is determined according to scheduling of the base station, the DCI carried on the
   PDCCH is sent in an enhanced manner, and the UE is notified of the determined first
   frequency resource by means of the resource block allocation in the DCI; or the first
30 frequency resource is determined in the predefined manner, and the first frequency
   resource is used for repeated sending of the at least one of the unicast data, the SIB, or
   the RAR in multiple subframes. The second frequency resource used to send the
   second information or send the second information in an enhanced manner is
   generally determined as middle 72 subcarriers in system bandwidth.
                                                33

   [01121      When there is an overlapping frequency resource between the first
   frequency resource and the second frequency resource, for example, when the first
   frequency resource includes at least one subcarrier in the middle 72 subcarriers in the
   system bandwidth, the at least one subcarrier is the overlapping frequency resource,
 5 and enhanced sending of the at least one of the unicast data, the SIB, or the RAR may
   conflict with enhanced sending of the MIB. Therefore, step 103 or step 104 is
   performed next.
   [0113]      In step 103, in a subframe for sending the MIB in an enhanced manner, the
   MIB is sent in an enhanced manner by using the second frequency resource, and in an
10 available subframe for sending the at least one of the unicast data, the SIB, or the
   RAR in an enhanced manner, the at least one of the unicast data, the SIB, or the RAR
   is sent in an enhanced manner by using the first frequency resource, where the
   available subframe for sending the at least one of the unicast data, the SIB, or the
   RAR in an enhanced manner is one or more subframes other than a subframe in a
15 subframe set for sending the MIB in an enhanced manner. In other words, the unicast
   data, the SIB, or the RAR is not sent in an enhanced manner in the subframe in the
   subframe set for sending the MIB in an enhanced manner.
   [0114]      Further, at least one subframe in the subframe set for sending the MIB in
   an enhanced manner is a subframe within duration for sending the at least one of the
20 unicast data, the SIB, or the RAR in an enhanced manner. For enhanced sending of
   the SIB, the duration is equal to a change cycle of the SIB, and for enhanced sending
   of the unicast data or the RAR, the duration is duration between a start subframe for
   sending one transport block of the information in an enhanced manner and an end
   subframe for sending the transport block in an enhanced manner. That is, the duration
25 for sending the at least one of the unicast data, the SIB, or the RAR in an enhanced
   manner includes the at least one subframe in the subframe set for sending the MIB in
   an enhanced manner, and in another subframe in all subframes included in the
   duration except the subframe in the subframe set for sending the MIB in an enhanced
   manner, the at least one of the unicast data, the SIB, or the RAR is sent in an
30 enhanced manner by using the first frequency resource.
   [0115]      The unicast data is used as an example. As shown in FIG. 3, if the MIB is
   sent in an enhanced manner in subframes 0 and subframes 5 in all radio frames in a
   period of 40 ms, the unicast data is scheduled by using the DCI carried on the
   PDCCH, and a frequency resource configured by means of the resource block
                                               34

   allocation in the DCI is the middle 72 subcarriers in the system bandwidth, the unicast
   data is not sent in an enhanced manner in the subframes 0 and the subframes 5. That is,
   the unicast data is not sent in an enhanced manner by using the subframes for sending
   the MIB in an enhanced manner, but instead, the unicast data is sent in an enhanced
 5 manner in other subframes, than the subframes for sending the MIB in an enhanced
   manner, within duration for sending the unicast data in an enhanced manner.
   [0116]      For the method in step 104, in this embodiment, the following is
   specifically used as an example for description: In the subframe in the subframe set
   for sending the second information in an enhanced manner, the first information is
10 sent in an enhanced manner on the available physical resource block PRB for the first
   information, where the available PRB for the first information is specifically the PRB,
   other than the PRB on which the overlapping frequency resource is located, in the
   PRB on which the first frequency resource is located.
   [0117]      The unicast data is still used as an example. As shown in FIG. 4, if the MIB
15 is sent in an enhanced manner in subframes 0 and subframes 5 in all radio frames in a
   period of 40 ms, PRBs on which the first frequency resource configured for the
   unicast data by means of the resource block allocation in the DCI is located include
   middle six PRBs in the system bandwidth, and PRBs on which the second frequency
   resource used to send the MIB in an enhanced manner is located are the middle six
20 PRBs in the system bandwidth, in the subframes 0 and the subframes 5, the unicast
   data is sent in an enhanced manner on another PRB, than the middle six PRBs in the
   system bandwidth, in the PRBs on which the first frequency resource configured by
   means of the resource block allocation in the DCI is located, and in other subframes,
   than the subframes for sending the MIB in an enhanced manner, within duration for
25 sending the unicast data in an enhanced manner, the unicast data is sent in an
   enhanced manner on the PRBs on which the first frequency resource is located.
   [0118]      There are specifically two manners in this embodiment.
   [0119]      In a first manner, in a subframe for sending the MIB in an enhanced
   manner, the at least one of the unicast data, the SIB, or the RAR is sent in an
30 enhanced manner in a manner of puncturing the PRB on which the overlapping
   frequency resource is located.
   [0120]      The unicast data is used as an example. Sending, in the subframe for
   sending the MIB in an enhanced manner, the unicast data in an enhanced manner on
   an available physical resource block PRB for the unicast data specifically includes the
                                                 35

   following steps: A quantity of all available bits for one transport block of the unicast
   data is determined according to the quantity of PRBs on which the first frequency
   resource is located; a sending bit of the transport block of the unicast data is selected
   according to the quantity of all available bits for the transport block; and a modulation
 5 symbol of the unicast data is mapped to a resource element RE included in the PRB
   on which the first frequency resource is located, and when a first RE in the RE is
   included in the PRB on which the overlapping frequency resource is located, a
   modulation symbol corresponding to the first RE is discarded. One RE is defined as
   one symbol in time and one subcarrier in frequency. When the first RE in the RE is
10 included in the middle six PRBs in the system bandwidth, the modulation symbol that
   is of the unicast data and mapped to the first RE is discarded.
   [0121]      In a second manner, in a subframe for sending the MIB in an enhanced
   manner, the at least one of the unicast data, the SIB, or the RAR is sent in an
   enhanced manner in a manner of performing rate matching on the PRB on which the
15 overlapping frequency resource is located.
   [0122]      The unicast data is used as an example. Sending, in the subframe for
   sending the MIB in an enhanced manner, the unicast data in an enhanced manner on
   an available physical resource block PRB for the unicast data specifically includes the
   following steps: A quantity of all available bits for one transport block of the unicast
20 data is determined according to a quantity of available PRBs for the unicast data; a
   sending bit of the transport block of the unicast data is selected according to the
   quantity of all available bits for the transport block; and a modulation symbol of the
   unicast data is mapped to a resource element RE included in the available PRB for the
   unicast data.
25 [0123]      Further, as described in the background, there are three options: A, B, and
   C for which period of 40 ms in which the MIB is sent in an enhanced manner. In a
   case of the option B, the base station decides whether the MIB is sent in an enhanced
   manner in a period of 40 ms, and the base station may dynamically choose whether to
   send the MIB in an enhanced manner. From a perspective of the UE, the UE does not
30 know whether the base station sends the MIB in an enhanced manner in a period of 40
   ms, and therefore, does not know whether a frequency resource configured by means
   of the resource block allocation in the DCI or a predefined frequency resource
   conflicts with a frequency resource used to send the MIB in an enhanced manner.
   Therefore, when the base station sends the at least one of the SIB, the RAR, or the
                                                36

   unicast data in an enhanced manner, it is assumed that the MIB is sent in an enhanced
   manner in all periods of 40 ms, that is, a subframe set for sending the MIB in an
   enhanced manner includes subframes that are in all radio frames and whose numbers
   are the same as that of the subframe for sending the MIB in an enhanced manner. As
 5 shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the subframe set for sending the MIB in an enhanced
   manner includes subframes 0 and subframes 5 in all the radio frames. This solution is
   also applied to the option A. In a case of the option C, if the UE can obtain a
   predefined pattern, the UE can know that the base station sends the MIB in an
   enhanced manner in which period of 40 ms and does not send the MIB in an enhanced
10 manner in which period of 40 ms, and therefore, also know a period of 40 ms in
   which a frequency resource configured by means of the resource block allocation in
   the DCI or a predefined frequency resource conflicts with a frequency resource used
   to send the MIB in an enhanced manner. Therefore, when the base station sends the at
   least one of the SIB, the RAR, or the unicast data, it is also assumed, according to the
15 predefined pattern, whether the MIB is sent in an enhanced manner in a period of 40
   ms, that is, a subframe set for sending the MIB in an enhanced manner includes the
   subframe for sending the MIB in an enhanced manner. As shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4,
   the subframe set for sending the MIB in an enhanced manner includes subframes 0
   and subframes 5 in radio frames in the period of 40 ms for sending the MIB in an
20 enhanced manner.
   [0124]      In a second implementation form, in this embodiment, the first information
   is an RAR, and the second information is a SIB, where the SIB may be specifically a
   SIB 1, a SIB2, ..., or a SIB 16 or may be a new SIB such as a SIB 17 or a SIBm defined
   for UE in a basement or with poor channel quality.
25 [0125]      In step 101 and step 102, the base station determines the first frequency
   resource used to send the first information in an enhanced manner, and determines the
   second frequency resource used to send the second information or send the second
   information in an enhanced manner. Specifically, the base station determines,
   according to scheduling of the base station, the first frequency resource used for the
30 RAR and/or the second frequency resource used for the SIB, then sends or sends, in
   an enhanced manner, the DCI carried on the PDCCH, and notifies the UE of the
   determined first frequency resource and/or the determined second frequency resource
   by means of the resource block allocation in the DCI; or the base station determines,
   in the predefined manner, the first frequency resource used for the RAR and/or the
                                               37

   second frequency resource used for the SIB. When there is an overlapping frequency
   between the first frequency resource used for the RAR and the second frequency
   resource used for the SIB, enhanced sending of the RAR may conflict with sending or
   enhanced sending of the SIB. Therefore, the base station performs step 103 or step
 5 104 next.
   [0126]     In step 103, in an available subframe for sending the RAR in an enhanced
   manner, the RAR is sent in an enhanced manner by using the first frequency resource,
   where the available subframe for sending the RAR in an enhanced manner is one or
   more subframes other than a subframe in a subframe set for sending the SIB or
10 sending the SIB in an enhanced manner. In other words, the RAR is not sent in an
   enhanced manner in the subframe in the subframe set for sending the SIB or sending
   the SIB in an enhanced manner. The subframe set for sending the SIB or sending the
   SIB in an enhanced manner includes a subframe for sending the SIB or sending the
   SIB in an enhanced manner. Further, at least one subframe in the subframe set for
15 sending the SIB or sending the SIB in an enhanced manner is a subframe within
   duration for sending the RAR in an enhanced manner. The duration is duration
   between a start subframe for sending one transport block of the RAR in an enhanced
   manner and an end subframe for sending the transport block in an enhanced manner.
   That is, the duration for sending the RAR in an enhanced manner includes the
20 subframe for sending the SIB or sending the SIB in an enhanced manner, and in
   another subframe in all subframes included in the duration except the subframe for
   sending the SIB or sending the SIB in an enhanced manner, the RAR is sent in an
   enhanced manner by using the first frequency resource.
   [0127]     As shown in FIG. 5, predefined frequency resources are used for enhanced
25 sending of the RAR and the SIB in multiple subframes, and a frequency resource
   predefined for the RAR includes a frequency resource predefined for the SIB.
   Assuming that a moment n is a start moment of the last subframe in which the UE
   sends a random access preamble in a random access process, the base station starts to
   send the RAR to the UE in a subframe whose start moment is n+k, and N subframes
30 are required to send the RAR in an enhanced manner. If some subframes in N
   consecutive subframes starting from the moment n+k are subframes for sending the
   SIB in an enhanced manner, the RAR is not sent in an enhanced manner in the
   subframes for sending the SIB in an enhanced manner; instead, the RAR is sent in an
   enhanced manner in subframes following the N consecutive subframes, and enhanced
                                              38

   sending of the RAR is not completed until a quantity of subframes for sending the
   RAR in an enhanced manner reaches N, where k and N are positive integers.
   [0128]      In step 104, for sending, in a subframe for sending the SIB or sending the
   SIB in an enhanced manner, the RAR in an enhanced manner on the frequency
 5 resource other than the overlapping frequency resource in the first frequency resource,
   the following is specifically used as an example for description: In the subframe for
   sending the SIB or sending the SIB in an enhanced manner, the RAR is sent in an
   enhanced manner on an available physical resource block PRB for the RAR, where
   the available PRB for the RAR is specifically a PRB, other than the PRB on which the
10 overlapping frequency resource is located, in the PRB on which the first frequency
   resource is located.
   [0129]      Specifically, for example, predefined PRBs are used for enhanced sending
   of the RAR and the SIB in multiple subframes, and a PRB predefined for the RAR
   includes one or more PRBs predefined for the SIB. Assuming that a moment n is a
15 start moment of the last subframe in which the UE sends a random access preamble in
   a random access process, the base station starts to send the RAR to the UE in a
   subframe whose start moment is n+k, and M subframes are required to send the RAR
   in an enhanced manner. If some subframes in M consecutive subframes starting from
   the moment n+k are subframes for sending the SIB, in the subframes for sending the
20 SIB in an enhanced manner, the RAR is sent in an enhanced manner only on another
   PRB, than the PRB predefined for the SIB, in the PRB predefined for the RAR, and in
   another subframe, the RAR is sent in an enhanced manner on the PRB predefined for
   the RAR, where k and M are positive integers.
   [0130]      In this embodiment, in the subframe for sending the SIB or sending the
25 SIB in an enhanced manner, the RAR is sent in an enhanced manner on the available
   physical resource block PRB for the RAR, and the RAR may be sent in an enhanced
   manner in a manner of puncturing the PRB on which the overlapping frequency
   resource is located or performing rate matching on the PRB on which the overlapping
   frequency resource is located, where steps specifically included in the manner of
30 puncturing or performing rate matching are similar to the descriptions of step 104 in
   the first implementation form.
   [0131]      In a third implementation form, in this embodiment, the first information is
   a paging message, and the second information is a SIB and/or an RAR, where the SIB
   may be a SIB1, a SIB2, ... , or a SIB16 or may be a new SIB such as a SIB17 or a
                                               39

   SIBm defined for UE in a basement or with poor channel quality.
   [0132]      In step 101 and step 102, the base station determines the first frequency
   resource used to send the paging message in an enhanced manner, and determines the
   second frequency resource used to send or send, in an enhanced manner, the SIB
 5 and/or the RAR. Specifically, the base station determines the first frequency resource
   and/or the second frequency resource according to scheduling of the base station, then
   sends or sends, in an enhanced manner, the DCI carried on the PDCCH, and notifies
   the UE of the determined first frequency resource and/or the determined second
   frequency resource by means of the resource block allocation in the DCI; or the base
10 station determines the first frequency resource and/or the second frequency resource
   in the predefined manner. The determined frequency resources are used for enhanced
   sending of the paging message, the SIB, or the RAR in multiple subframes. When
   there is an overlapping frequency resource between the first frequency resource used
   for the paging message and the second frequency resource used for the RAR and/or
15 the SIB, enhanced sending of the paging message may conflict with sending or
   enhanced sending of the RAR and/or the SIB. Therefore, step 103 or step 104 is
   performed.
   [0133]      In step 103, in an available subframe for sending the paging message in an
   enhanced manner, the paging message is sent in an enhanced manner by using the first
20 frequency resource, where the available subframe for sending the paging message in
   an enhanced manner is one or more subframes other than a subframe in a subframe set
   for sending the SIB and/or the RAR or sending the SIB and/or the RAR in an
   enhanced manner. In other words, the paging message is not sent in an enhanced
   manner in the subframe in the subframe set for sending or sending, in an enhanced
25 manner, the SIB and/or the RAR. The subframe set for sending or sending, in an
   enhanced manner, the SIB and/or the RAR includes a subframe for sending or sending,
   in an enhanced manner, the SIB and/or the RAR.
   [0134]      As shown in FIG. 6, it is assumed that a moment n is a start moment of the
   last subframe in which the UE sends a random access preamble in a random access
30 process, the base station starts to send the RAR to the UE in an enhanced manner in a
   subframe whose start moment is n+k, the SIB is sent in an enhanced manner only in a
   subframe 5, and a calculated PO includes the subframe for sending the RAR and/or
   the SIB in an enhanced manner. Predefined frequency resources are used for enhanced
   sending of the paging message, the RAR, and the SIB in multiple subframes, and a
                                                40

   frequency resource predefined for the paging message is completely the same as a
   frequency resource predefined for the SIB, and is different from a frequency resource
   predefined for the RAR. When the PO is the subframe 5 for sending the SIB in an
   enhanced manner, the paging message is not sent in an enhanced manner, and in
 5 another subframe in the PO, the paging message is sent in an enhanced manner, where
   n and k are positive integers.
   [0135]      Alternatively, a formula for calculating a PF and a PO for sending the
   paging message in an enhanced manner needs to meet: both a calculated PF and a
   calculated PO are not the same as a subframe and a radio frame for sending or sending,
10 in an enhanced manner, the SIB, and/or both a calculated PF and a calculated PO are
   not the same as a subframe and a radio frame for sending or sending, in an enhanced
   manner, the RAR.
   [0136]      In step 104, for example, sending, in a subframe for sending the SIB
   and/or the RAR or sending the SIB and/or the RAR in an enhanced manner, the
15 paging message in an enhanced manner on the frequency resource other than the
   overlapping frequency resource in the first frequency resource specifically includes:
   in the subframe for sending the SIB and/or the RAR or sending the SIB and/or the
   RAR in an enhanced manner, sending the paging message in an enhanced manner on
   an available physical resource block PRB for paging, where the available PRB for the
20 paging message is specifically a PRB, other than the PRB on which the overlapping
   frequency resource is located, in the PRB on which the first frequency resource is
   located.
   [0137]      Specifically, for example, it is assumed that a moment n is a start moment
   of the last subframe in which the UE sends a random access preamble in a random
25 access process, the base station starts to send the RAR to the UE in an enhanced
   manner in a subframe whose start moment is n+k, the SIB is sent in an enhanced
   manner only in a subframe 5, and a calculated PO includes a subframe for sending the
   RAR and/or the SIB in an enhanced manner. Predefined PRBs are used for enhanced
   sending of the paging message, the RAR, and the SIB in multiple subframes, and a
30 PRB predefined for the paging message includes a PRB predefined for the SIB, and
   does not include a PRB predefined for the RAR. When the PO is the subframe 5 for
   sending the SIB in an enhanced manner, the paging message is sent in an enhanced
   manner only on another PRB, than the PRB predefined for the SIB, in the PRB
   predefined for the paging message, and in another subframe in the PO, the paging
                                                41

   message is sent in an enhanced manner on the PRB predefined for the paging
   message.
   [0138]     In this embodiment, in the subframe for sending the SIB and/or the RAR
   or sending the SIB and/or the RAR in an enhanced manner, the paging message is sent
 5 in an enhanced manner on the available physical resource block PRB for the paging
   message, and the paging message may be sent in an enhanced manner in a manner of
   puncturing the PRB on which the overlapping frequency resource is located or
   performing rate matching on the PRB on which the overlapping frequency resource is
   located, where steps specifically included in the manner of puncturing or performing
10 rate matching are similar to the descriptions of step 104 in the first implementation
   form.
   [0139]     In a fourth implementation form, in this embodiment, the first information
   is unicast data, and the second information is at least one of a SIB, an RAR, or a
   paging message. The SIB may be a SIB 1, a SIB2, ... , or a SIB 16 or may be a new SIB
15 such as a SIB 17 or a SIBm defined for UE in a basement or with poor channel quality.
   [0140]     Step 101 and step 102 are performed to determine the first frequency
   resource used to send the unicast data in an enhanced manner, and determine the
   second frequency resource used to send or send, in an enhanced manner, the at least
   one of the SIB, the RAR, or the paging message. Specifically, the base station
20 determines, according to scheduling of the base station, the first frequency resource
   used for the unicast data, sends, in an enhanced manner, the DCI carried on the
   PDCCH, and notifies the UE of the determined first frequency resource by means of
   the resource block allocation in the DCI. The first frequency resource configured by
   means of the resource block allocation in the DCI is used for enhanced sending of the
25 unicast data in multiple subframes. The base station determines, according to
   scheduling of the base station, the second frequency resource used for the paging
   message, the SIB, or the RAR, sends or sends, in an enhanced manner, the DCI
   carried on the PDCCH, and notifies the UE of the determined second frequency
   resource by means of the resource block allocation in the DCI; or the base station
30 determines the second frequency resource in the predefined manner, and the second
   frequency resource is used for enhanced sending of the paging message, the SIB, or
   the RAR in multiple subframes.
   [0141]     When there is an overlapping frequency resource between the first
   frequency resource for the unicast data and the second frequency resource for the at
                                             42

   least one of the paging message, the RAR, or the SIB, the first frequency resource
   used to send the unicast data in an enhanced manner may conflict with the at least one
   of the paging message, the RAR, or the SIB to be sent or sent in an enhanced manner.
   In this case, step 103 or step 104 is performed.
 5 [0142]       In step 103, in an available subframe for sending the unicast data in an
   enhanced manner, the unicast data is sent in an enhanced manner by using the first
   frequency resource, where the available subframe for sending the unicast data in an
   enhanced manner is one or more subframes other than a subframe in a subframe set
   for sending the at least one of the paging message, the RAR, or the SIB or sending the
10 at least one of the paging message, the RAR, or the SIB in an enhanced manner. In
   other words, the unicast data is not sent in an enhanced manner in a subframe for
   sending or sending, in an enhanced manner, the at least one of the SIB, the RAR, or
   the paging message. The subframe set for sending or sending, in an enhanced manner,
   the at least one of the SIB, the RAR, or the paging message includes the subframe for
15 sending or sending, in an enhanced manner, the at least one of the SIB, the RAR, or
   the paging message. Further, at least one subframe in the subframe set for sending or
   sending, in an enhanced manner, the SIB, the RAR, or the paging message is a
   subframe within duration for sending the unicast data in an enhanced manner. The
   duration is duration between a start subframe for sending one transport block of the
20 unicast data in an enhanced manner and an end subframe for sending the transport
   block in an enhanced manner. That is, the duration for sending the unicast data in an
   enhanced manner includes at least one of the subframe for sending or sending, in an
   enhanced manner, the at least one of the SIB, the RAR, or the paging message, and in
   another subframe in all subframes included in the duration except the subframe for
25 sending or sending, in an enhanced manner, the at least one of the SIB, the RAR, or
   the paging message, the unicast data is sent in an enhanced manner by using the first
   frequency resource.
   [0143]       Specifically referring to FIG. 7, it is assumed that a moment n is a start
   moment of the last subframe in which the UE sends a random access preamble in a
30 random access process, the base station starts to send the RAR to the UE in an
   enhanced manner in a subframe whose start moment is n+k, the SIB is sent in an
   enhanced manner only in a subframe 5, and a calculated PO is indicated in FIG. 7.
   Predefined frequency resources are used for enhanced sending of the paging message,
   the RAR, and the SIB in multiple subframes, a frequency resource predefined for the
                                               43

   paging message is completely the same as a frequency resource predefined for the
   SIB, and another frequency resource is predefined for the RAR. A frequency resource
   configured by means of the resource block allocation in the DCI is used for enhanced
   sending of the unicast data, and the frequency resource configured by means of the
 5 resource block allocation in the DCI is completely the same as the frequency resource
   predefined for the paging message and the SIB. The unicast data is not sent in an
   enhanced manner in the subframe 5 for sending the SIB in an enhanced manner and a
   subframe in which the PO is located, and the unicast data is sent in an enhanced
   manner in another subframe.
10 [0144]      For example, the method in step 104 is specifically: in a subframe in a
   subframe set for sending the at least one of the paging message, the RAR, or the SIB
   or sending the at least one of the paging message, the RAR, or the SIB in an enhanced
   manner, sending the unicast data in an enhanced manner on an available physical
   resource block PRB for the unicast data, where the available PRB for the unicast data
15 is a PRB, other than the PRB on which the overlapping frequency resource is located,
   in the PRB on which the first frequency resource is located.
   [0145]      Specifically, for example, it is assumed that a moment n is a start moment
   of the last subframe in which the UE sends a random access preamble in a random
   access process, the base station starts to send the RAR to the UE in an enhanced
20 manner in a subframe whose start moment is n+k, and the SIB is sent in an enhanced
   manner only in a subframe 5. Predefined PRBs are used for enhanced sending of the
   paging message, the RAR, and the SIB in multiple subframes, a PRB predefined for
   the paging message is completely the same as a PRB predefined for the SIB, and
   another PRB is predefined for the RAR. A PRB configured by means of the resource
25 block allocation in the DCI is used for enhanced sending of the unicast data, and the
   PRB configured by means of the resource block allocation in the DCI includes the
   PRB predefined for the paging message and the SIB, and does not include the PRB
   predefined for the RAR. In the subframe 5 for sending the SIB in an enhanced manner
   and a subframe in which the PO is located, the unicast data is sent in an enhanced
30 manner only on another PRB, than the PRB predefined for the SIB and the paging
   message, in the PRB configured by means of the resource block allocation in the DCI,
   and in another subframe for sending the unicast data in an enhanced manner, the
   unicast data is sent on the PRB configured by means of the resource block allocation
   in the DCI.
                                                44

   [0146]       In this embodiment, in the subframe in the subframe set for sending the at
   least one of the paging message, the RAR, or the SIB or sending the at least one of the
   paging message, the RAR, or the SIB in an enhanced manner, the unicast data is sent
   in an enhanced manner on the available physical resource block PRB for the unicast
 5 data, and the unicast data may be sent in an enhanced manner in a manner of
   puncturing the PRB on which the overlapping frequency resource is located or
   performing rate matching on the PRB on which the overlapping frequency resource is
   located, where steps specifically included in the manner of puncturing or performing
   rate matching are similar to the descriptions of step 104 in the first implementation
10 form.
   [0147]       In a fifth implementation form, in this embodiment, the first information is
   first unicast data, and the second information is second unicast data, where the first
   unicast data and the second unicast data are different unicast data. For example, the
   first unicast data and the second unicast data are unicast data for different UE.
15 [0148]       Step 101 and step 102 are performed to determine the first frequency
   resource used to send the first unicast data in an enhanced manner, and determine the
   second frequency resource used to send or send, in an enhanced manner, the second
   unicast data. Specifically, the base station determines, according to scheduling of the
   base station, the first frequency resource used for the first unicast data and the second
20 frequency resource used for the second unicast data, sends or sends, in an enhanced
   manner, the DCI carried on the PDCCH, and notifies the UE of the determined first
   frequency resource and the determined second frequency resource by means of the
   resource block allocation in the DCI. The first frequency resource configured by
   means of the resource block allocation in the DCI is used for enhanced sending of the
25 first unicast data in multiple subframes. When there is an overlapping frequency
   resource between the first frequency resource for the first unicast data and the second
   frequency resource for the second unicast data, enhanced sending of the first unicast
   data may conflict with sending or enhanced sending of the second unicast data. In this
   case, step 103 or step 104 is performed.
30 [0149]       In step 103, in an available subframe for sending the first unicast data in an
   enhanced manner, the first unicast data is sent in an enhanced manner by using the
   first frequency resource, where the available subframe for sending the first unicast
   data in an enhanced manner is one or more subframes other than a subframe in a
   subframe set for sending or sending, in an enhanced manner, the second unicast data.
                                                45

   In other words, the first unicast data is not sent in an enhanced manner in the
   subframe in the subframe set for sending or sending, in an enhanced manner, the
   second unicast data. The subframe set for sending or sending, in an enhanced manner,
   the second unicast data includes a subframe for sending or sending, in an enhanced
 5 manner, the second unicast data. Further, at least one subframe in the subframe set for
   sending or sending, in an enhanced manner, the second unicast data is a subframe
   within duration for sending the first unicast data in an enhanced manner. The duration
   is duration between a start subframe for sending one transport block of the first
   unicast data in an enhanced manner and an end subframe for sending the transport
10 block in an enhanced manner. That is, the duration for sending the first unicast data in
   an enhanced manner includes at least one of the subframe for sending or sending, in
   an enhanced manner, the second unicast data, and in another subframe in all
   subframes included in the duration except the subframe for sending or sending, in an
   enhanced manner, the second unicast data, the first unicast data is sent in an enhanced
15 manner by using the first frequency resource.
   [0150]       Specifically referring to FIG. 8, the first unicast data is to be sent to UE in
   a basement or with poor channel quality, and a frequency resource configured by
   means of resource block allocation in first DCI is used for enhanced sending of the
   first unicast data in multiple subframes; and the second unicast data is to be sent to
20 UE with good channel quality and is sent only in one subframe, and a frequency
   resource configured by means of resource block allocation in second DCI is used.
   There is an overlapping frequency resource between the first frequency resource used
   for the first unicast data and the second frequency resource used for the second
   unicast data, and duration for sending the first unicast data includes the subframe for
25 sending the second unicast data. The first unicast data is not sent in an enhanced
   manner in the subframe for sending the second unicast data, and the first unicast data
   is sent in an enhanced manner in another subframe.
   [0151]       In the method in step 104, in a subframe for sending or sending, in an
   enhanced manner, the second unicast data, the first unicast data is sent in an enhanced
30 manner on the frequency resource other than the overlapping frequency resource in
   the first frequency resource, which may be further specifically: in the subframe for
   sending or sending, in an enhanced manner, the second unicast data, sending the first
   unicast data in an enhanced manner on an available physical resource block PRB for
   the first unicast data, where the available PRB for the first unicast data is a PRB, other
                                                46

   than the PRB on which the overlapping frequency resource is located, in the PRB on
   which the first frequency resource is located.
   [0152]       Specifically, for example, the first unicast data is to be sent to UE in a
   basement or with poor channel quality, and a frequency resource configured by means
 5 of resource block allocation in first DCI is used for enhanced sending of the first
   unicast data in multiple subframes; the second unicast data is to be sent to UE with
   good channel quality and is sent only in one subframe, and a frequency resource
   configured by means of resource block allocation in second DCI is used. There is an
   overlapping frequency resource between the frequency resource used for the first
10 unicast data and the frequency resource used for the second unicast data. When a
   subframe for sending the first unicast data in an enhanced manner is also a subframe
   for sending the second unicast data, the first unicast data is sent in an enhanced
   manner only on another PRB, than a PRB configured for the second unicast data, in a
   PRB configured by means of the resource block allocation in the first DCI, and in
15 another subframe for sending the first unicast data in an enhanced manner, the first
   unicast data is sent on the PRB configured by means of the resource block allocation
   in the first DCI.
   [0153]       In this embodiment, in the subframe for sending or sending, in an
   enhanced manner, the second unicast data, the first unicast data is sent in an enhanced
20 manner on the available physical resource block PRB for the first unicast data, and the
   first unicast data may be sent in an enhanced manner in a manner of puncturing the
   PRB on which the overlapping frequency resource is located or performing rate
   matching on the PRB on which the overlapping frequency resource is located, where
   steps specifically included in the manner of puncturing or performing rate matching
25 are similar to the descriptions of step 104 in the first implementation form.
   [0154]       With reference to the foregoing embodiments, when the first information
   or the second information is another system information block than a type-i SIB, for
   example, a type of the SIB is specifically at least one of a SIB2, ... , a SIB 16, or a type
   of a new SIB such as a SIB 17 or a SIBm defined for UE in a basement or with poor
30 channel quality, the base station determines the first frequency resource or the second
   frequency resource according to scheduling of the base station. The method further
   includes: sending or sending, in an enhanced manner, the type-i system information
   block, where the type-i system information block includes configuration information
   of the first frequency resource or the second frequency resource. A frequency resource
                                               47

   configured by the base station is used for enhanced sending of a SIB in multiple
   subframes.
   [0155]       The base station includes the configuration information of the first
   frequency resource or the second frequency resource in the to-be-sent SIB 1, where the
 5 configuration    information is specifically an information element (Information
   Element, IE) for resource block allocation or resource configuration. The UE may
   obtain the IE by receiving the SIB 1, so that a frequency resource used for at least one
   of another system information block one or more other subframes than a subframe in
   the type-i SIB is determined by using the IE, and the at least one of the another
10 system information block than the type-i SIB is received or received in an enhanced
   manner on the determined frequency resource.
   [0156]       The method procedure shown in FIG. 2 is described from a base station
   side. Further referring to FIG. 9, FIG. 9 is a method flowchart of an information
   transmission method on a user equipment side in this embodiment. Referring to FIG. 9,
15 the method includes:
   [0157]       Step 201: Determine a first frequency resource, where the first frequency
   resource is a frequency resource used to send first information in an enhanced manner.
   [0158]       Step 202: Determine a second frequency resource, where the second
   frequency resource is a frequency resource used to send second information or send
20 second information in an enhanced manner.
   [0159]       When there is an overlapping frequency resource between the first
   frequency resource and the second frequency resource, step 203 or step 204 is
   performed.
   [0160]       Step 203: Receive, in an available subframe         for sending the first
25 information in an enhanced manner, the first information in an enhanced manner on
   the first frequency resource, where the available subframe is one or more subframes
   other than a subframe in a subframe set for sending the second information or sending
   the second information in an enhanced manner.
   [0161]       Step 204: Receive, in a subframe in a subframe set for sending the second
30 information or sending the second information in an enhanced manner, the first
   information in an enhanced manner on a frequency resource other than the
   overlapping frequency resource in the first frequency resource.
   [0162]       Step 201 and step 202 may be performed at the same time or may be
   performed sequentially. Further, manners of determining the first frequency resource
                                               48

   and the second frequency resource in step 201 and step 202 may be the same or may
   be different, and are generally corresponding to manners in which a base station
   determines the first frequency resource and the second frequency resource in step 101
   and step 102. For example, a possible implementation manner is as follows: UE
 5 receives or receives, in an enhanced manner, DCI carried on a PDCCH, and
   determines the first frequency resource and/or the second frequency resource by
   means of resource block allocation in the DCI; or UE determines the first frequency
   resource and/or the second frequency resource in a predefined manner, where the
   predefined manner may be protocol agreement; or when the first information or the
10 second information is another system information block than a type-i           system
   information block, the first frequency resource is determined or the second frequency
   resource is determined. Another possible implementation manner is specifically as
   follows: A type-i system information block is received or received in an enhanced
   manner, and the first frequency resource or the second frequency resource is
15 determined according to configuration information included in the type-i system
   information block.
   [0163]     When the first frequency resource and the second frequency resource
   overlap, the UE receives the first information in a manner in step 203 or receives the
   first information in a manner in step 204. A receiving manner in step 203 is
20 corresponding to a sending manner in step 103, and a receiving manner in step 204 is
   corresponding to a sending manner in step 104. Specifically, a to-be-used receiving
   manner depends on a sending manner used by the base station. Generally, the both
   sides: the UE and the base station may agree on a sending manner and a receiving
   manner in advance. When a communications system runs, data transmission is
25 performed in the sending manner and the receiving manner that are agreed on. In
   another embodiment, specifically, the base station may notify the UE of a sending
   manner used by the base station, which may be performed each time or may be
   performed when the sending manner changes. For example, agreement on the sending
   manner and the receiving manner in advance may be protocol agreement. The
30 receiving the first information in an enhanced manner includes receiving the first
   information in multiple subframes.
   [0164]     Optionally, corresponding to the sending, in the subframe in the subframe
   set for sending the second information or sending the second information in an
   enhanced manner, the first information in an enhanced manner on an available
                                              49

   physical resource block PRB for the first information, where the available PRB for the
   first information is specifically a PRB, other than a PRB on which the overlapping
   frequency resource is located, in PRBs on which the first frequency resource is
   located, step 204 is specifically: receiving, in the subframe in the subframe set for
 5 sending the second information or sending the second information in an enhanced
   manner, the first information in an enhanced manner on an available physical resource
   block PRB for the first information, where the available PRB for the first information
   is specifically a PRB, other than the PRB on which the overlapping frequency
   resource is located, in the PRB on which the first frequency resource is located.
10 [0165]      Further, in the subframe in the subframe set for sending the second
   information or sending the second information in an enhanced manner, at least one
   subframe is a subframe within duration for sending the first information in an
   enhanced manner, and the duration is a period for sending the first information in an
   enhanced manner or duration between a start subframe for sending the first
15 information in an enhanced manner and an end subframe for sending the first
   information in an enhanced manner.
   [0166]      In actual application, the first information is specifically at least one of
   unicast data, a system information block, or a random access response RAR, and the
   second information is specifically a master information block.
20 [0167]      Further, the subframe set for sending the second information or sending the
   second information in an enhanced manner includes subframes, whose numbers are
   the same as that of a subframe for sending the second information or sending the
   second information in an enhanced manner, in all radio frames; or the subframe set for
   sending the second information or sending the second information in an enhanced
25 manner includes a subframe for sending the second information or sending the second
   information in an enhanced manner.
   [0168]      In another embodiment, the first information is specifically a random
   access response RAR, and the second information is specifically a system information
   block; or
30             the first information is specifically a paging message, and the second
   information is specifically a system information block and/or a random access
   response RAR; or
               the first information     is specifically unicast data,    and the    second
   information is specifically at least one of a system information block, a random access
                                                50

   response RAR, or a paging message; or
               the first information is specifically first unicast data, and the second
   information is specifically second unicast data, where the first unicast data and the
   second unicast data are different unicast data.
 5 [0169]      For a specific example of each type of information, refer to the foregoing
   descriptions on a base station side. For brevity of this specification, details of
   corresponding receiving in this embodiment are not described herein.
                                        Embodiment 2
   [0170]      In an embodiment of this application, a base station is further provided.
10 Referring to FIG. 10, FIG. 10 is a functional block diagram of the base station in this
   embodiment. The base station includes: a first determining unit 301, configured to
   determine a first frequency resource, where the first frequency resource is a frequency
   resource used to send first information in an enhanced manner; a second determining
   unit 302, configured to determine a second frequency resource, where the second
15 frequency resource is a frequency resource used to send second information or send
   second information in an enhanced manner; and a sending unit 303, configured to:
   when there is an overlapping frequency resource between the first frequency resource
