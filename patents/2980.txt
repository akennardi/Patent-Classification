                              A JELLY FOOD PRODUCT
                              FIELD OF THE INVENTION
           This invention relates to a jelly food product. In particular, the
 5 invention relates to a jelly food product suitable for consumption by a
   patient with a mastication and/or deglutition disease, disorder or condition,
   such as dysphagia, and method of making same.
                        BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
10         In the management of dysphagia, jelly food products are a
   particularly problematic food to serve owing to the increased risk of
   aspiration in persons with dysphagia. In this regard, jelly food products are
   typically solid at a chilled serving temperature but return to a liquid at body
   temperature (i.e., about 37 to 38 0C). Additionally, jelly food products have
15 the extra complication that they normally fracture into solid and/or semi
   solid fragments when chewed that results in a mixed texture system in the
   mouth when consumed. Mixed textured systems are generally difficult to
   control in the mouths of people with dysphagia, making them more likely
   to contribute to the risk of aspiration and/or choking. As such, the common
20 approach to manage this risk is to simply eliminate jelly food products from
   the diet of people with dysphagia.
           Thus, there remains a need for a jelly food product that may be
   used, for example, to feed subjects suffering from a mastication and/or
   deglutition disorder, such as dysphagia, which overcomes one or more of
                                           1

   the inherent limitations of commercially available jelly food products.
                           SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
            In a first aspect, the invention provides a jelly food product suitable
 5 for consumption by a patient with a mastication and/or deglutition disease,
   disorder or condition comprising:
           water;
           about 10 to about 15 wt% of a sugar;
           about 0.5 to about 2.5 wt% of a gelling agent; and
10         about 0.1 to about 2.5 wt% of a metal salt.
            In a second aspect, the invention provides a method of preparing a
   jelly food product suitable for consumption by a patient with a mastication
   and/or deglutition disease, disorder or condition, including the steps of:
           (a) preparing a mixture comprising from about 10 to about 15 wt%
15 of a sugar, from about 0.5 to about 2.5 wt% of a gelling agent, from about
   0.1 to about 1.0 wt% of a metal salt and water;
           (b) heating the mixture to a temperature of between about 50'C
   and about 100'C;
           (c) mixing the mixture so as to hydrate the gelling agent; and
20         (d) cooling the mixture to a temperature of less than about 50'C, to
   thereby prepare the jelly food product.
            In one embodiment, for step (d), the mixture is cooled to less than
   about 50'C in less than about 60 minutes.
           For the above aspects, the gelling agent is suitably selected from

   BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
           To assist in understanding the invention and to enable a person
   skilled in the art to put the invention into practical effect, preferred
15 embodiments of the invention will be described by way of example only
   with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
   FIG 1 provides an embodiment of a manufacturing process for a jelly food
   product.
20                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
           The invention advantageously provides a jelly food product suitable
   for consumption by a patient with a mastication and/or deglutition disease,
   disorder or condition, such as dysphagia, that looks and tastes like
   traditional jelly food products but does not fracture in the mouth when
                                           4

   chewed and also retains an increased viscosity (e.g., 150cP to 900cP)
   when melted at body temperature that can be adequately controlled in the
   mouth of such patients.
           In one aspect, the invention provides a jelly food product suitable
 5 for consumption by a patient with a mastication and/or deglutition disease,
   disorder or condition comprising:
          water;
          about 10 to about 15 wt% of a sugar;
          about 0.5 to about 2.5 wt% of a gelling agent; and
10        about 0.1 to about 2.5 wt% of a metal salt.
          The term "jelly" or "jelly food product", as used herein, refers to a
   soft, semisolid food product with a resilient consistency, as are known in
   the art, that can be made by the setting of a liquid, such as water,
   containing a gelling agent such as a gum.
15        As used herein, the term "sugar" refers to a saccharide. The
   saccharide can      be either a     polysaccharide or a monosaccharide.
   Exemplary sugars include, but are not limited to, dextrose, sucrose,
   including low glycaemic index (GI) sucrose (e.g., NuCane T M , LoGiCane@),
   lactose, maltose, fructose, glucose, ribose, mannose, arabinose, xylose,
20 rhamnose, lyxose, galactose and the like. The sugar can also be an amino
   sugar. Examples of amino sugars include, but are not limited to, N
   acetylglucosamine, galactosamine, glucosamine, and the like. Preferably,
   the sugar is or comprises sucrose or a low GI variant thereof.
           It will be appreciated that the sugar content of prior art gel food
                                          5

   products stabilised with a gelling agent, such as carrageenan, is typically
   substantially above 15 wt% so as to facilitate formation of the desired firm
   and solid gel-structure of these gel food products. Such jelly food
   products, however, are prone to fracture and thus are not suitable for
 5 dysphagic patients
           Conversely, the sugar of the jelly food product of the invention is to
   be present in an amount from about 10 to about 15 wt% or any range
   therein such as, but not limited to, about 10 to about 14 wt%, or about 11
   to about 12 wt%. In particular embodiments of the present invention, the
10 sugar is present in an amount of about 10%, 10.25%, 10.5%, 10.75%,
   11%, 11.25%, 11.5%, 11.75%, 12%, 12.25%,              12.5%, 12.75%, 13%,
   13.25%, 13.5%, 13.75%, 14%, 14.25%, 14.5%, 14.75%, 15% or any
   range therein, by weight of the jelly food product. In certain embodiments
   of the present invention, the sugar is present in an amount from about 10
15 to about 12 wt%. By virtue of this reduction in sugar content, the jelly food
   product of the invention forms a solid or semi-solid gel-structure that does
   not fracture or is substantially fracture-resistant.
           The term "gelling agent" as generally used herein refers to a
   compound or composition used to impart a gel-like or thickening quality,
20 including solidification, to a medium, particularly a liquid medium, when
   dissolved or dispersed therein. Preferably, the gelling agent for producing
   the jelly food product is heat-reversible, such that the jelly food product, at
   least partly melts to a liquid form once a melting point temperature thereof
   has been reached.
                                           6

           Non-limiting examples of gelling agents include edible gums,
   vegetable gums and food-grade polysaccharides. Exemplary gelling
   agents include agar, alginic acid, carrageenan (including kappa, iota and
   lambda forms), guar gum, gum tragacanth, gum ghatti, microcrystalline
 5 cellulose,     sodium     carboxymethylcellulose,     methyl      cellulose,
   hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyproylcellulose, methylethylcellulose,
   gum karaya, locust bean gum, tara gum, psyllium seed gum, quince seed
   gum, a pectin, furcellaran, gellan gum, konjac, sodium alginate, xanthan
   gum and any combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the gelling
10 agent is selected from the group consisting of carrageenan, locust bean
   gum, xanthan gum and any combination thereof. In one particular
   embodiment, the gelling agent comprises carrageenan and xanthan gum.
           For the present aspect, the gelling agent is to be present in an
   amount from about 0.5 to about 2.5 wt% or any range therein such as, but
15 not limited to, about 1 to about 2 wt%, or about 0.5 to about 1.5 wt%. In
   particular embodiments of the present invention, the gelling agent is
   present in an amount of about 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9%, 1.0%,
   1.1%, 1.2%, 1.3%, 1.4%, 1.5%, 1.6%, 1.7%, 1.8%, 1.9%, 2.0%, 2.1%,
   2.2%, 2.3%, 2.4%, 2.5% or any range therein, by weight of the jelly food
20 product. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the gelling agent
   is present in an amount from about 0.8 to about 2.1 wt%.
           In certain embodiments,     the  gelling agent is or comprises
   carrageenan and more preferably kappa carrageenan. In this regard,
   carrageenan, including kappa carrageenan, is suitably present in an
                                        7

   amount from about 0.1 to about 2.5 wt% (e.g., 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6,
   0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2,
   2.3, 2.4, 2.5 wt% and any range therein), more preferably about 0.2 to
   about 1.0 wt% and even more preferably about 0.3 to about 0.5 wt%.
 5         The term "metal salt" is intended to mean an organic or inorganic
   salt of a metal, preferably of an alkali metal, such as those selected from:
   K, Li, Na or Cs. Potassium salts, such as potassium chloride and
   dipotassium phosphate, are particularly preferred.
           It will be appreciated that the gel strength of a jelly food product can
10 be determined at least in part by stabilisation of junction zones between
   individual molecules of a gelling agent by a metal ion. Accordingly, for the
   present invention, the metal salt is preferably present in an amount so as
   to produce a jelly food product that does not fracture and/or is fracture
   resistant. To this end, the metal salt can be present in an amount from
15 about 0.1 to about 2.5 wt% or any range therein such as, but not limited
   to, about 0.2 to about 0.8 wt%, or about 0.3 to about 0.5 wt%. In particular
   embodiments of the present invention, the metal salt is present in an
   amount of about 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9%,
   1.0%, 1.1%, 1.2%, 1.3%, 1.4%, 1.5%, 1.6%, 1.7%, 1.8%, 1.9%, 2.0%,
20 2.1%, 2.2%, 2.3%, 2.4%, 2.5% or any range therein, by weight of the jelly
   food product. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the metal
   salt is present in an amount from about 0.8 to about 2.1 wt%.
           Referring to the present aspect, water is also preferably present in
   an amount so as to produce a jelly food product that does not fracture
                                           8

   and/or is fracture-resistant. In any embodiment, water may make up the
   rest of the % by weight of the composition of the jelly food product. In this
   regard, water may be present in an amount from about 20 to about 90
   wt% or any range therein such as, but not limited to, about 30 to about 80
 5 wt%, or about 40 to about 70 wt%. In particular embodiments of the
   present invention, water is present in an amount of about 20%, 25%, 30%,
   35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%,
   80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90% or any
   range therein, by weight of the jelly food product.
10          In certain embodiments, the jelly food product at least partly melts
   into a liquid form at a temperature of at least about 25 0 C (e.g., about 25 0C,
   26 0C, 27 0C, 28 0C, 29 0C, 30 0 C, 31 0 C, 32 0C, 33 0C, 34 0 C, 35 0 C, 36 0C, 37 0C,
   38 0C, 39 0C and 40 0C) wherein the liquid form has a viscosity greater than
   about 95 cP (e.g., at least about 95, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 175,
15 200, 250, 300, 350,400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900,
   950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200, 1250, 1300, 1350, 1400, 1450, 1500,
   1550, 1600, 1650, 1700, 1750, 1800, 1850, 1900, 1950, 2000, 2050,
   2100, 2150, 2200, 2250, 2300, 2350, 2400, 2450, 2500, 2550, 2600,
   2650, 2700, 2750, 2800, 2850, 2900, 2950, 3000 cP, or any range
20 therein). Preferably, the liquid form has a viscosity of between about 100
   cP and about 1000 cP and more preferably between about 150 cP and
   about 900 cP. To this end, it would be advantageous for the liquid form of
   the jelly food product to be of a particular, known and repeatable viscosity
   to be applicable to those patients with the mastication and/or deglutition
                                              9

   disease, disorder or condition, such as dysphagia.
           The viscosity of the liquid form of the jelly food product may be
   measured by any means known in the art. By way of example, viscosity
   may be measured using a Brookfield Viscometer, a rheometer or similar
 5 device. Preferably, viscosity is measured in absolute centipoise as
   provided by a rheometer, rather than relative centipoise as measured by a
   viscometer. It would be appreciated by the skilled artisan that a rheometer
   measurement represents the best and therefore standard method for
   determining viscosity.
10         With respect to stability, the jelly food product of the invention may
   further comprise a food-grade preservative, as are well known in the art.
   Suitable food grade preservatives include, but are not limited to, gellan
   gum,      vitamin      E,     potassium       sorbate,      sodium       benzoate,
   sodiummetabisulphite, methyl paraben, EDTA, sulphur dioxide, nisin and
15 propionic acid. In one preferred embodiment, the food-grade preservative
   is or comprises gellan gum. The amount of preservative in the jelly food
   product may range from about 0.001 to about 0.1 percent by weight of the
   total weight of the jelly food product.
           Again, in regards to stability, the jelly food product described herein
20 suitably is of a pH between about 3.0 and about 7.5 (e.g., 3.1, 3.2, 3.3,
   3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.0,
   5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7,
   6.8, 6.9, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5 and any range therein). Preferably, the
   pH of the liquid composition is between about 3.0 and 4.5. To this end, the
                                            10

   acidic pH of the jelly food product may be achieved by any means known
   in the art.
           In view of the above, the jelly food product of the invention may
   further include a food grade acid, such as lactic acid, phosphoric acid,
 5 citric acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, succinic
   acid, tartaric acid, gluconic acid and any combination thereof. In one
   particular embodiment, the food grade acid is or comprises citric acid. The
   amount of food grade acid in the jelly food product may range from about
   0.1% to about 5.0% (e.g., about 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 1.0%,
10 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0%, 4.5%, 5.0%) by weight of the total
   weight of the jelly food product.
           It will be appreciated that the jelly food product may further include
   a food grade colouring agent. Such colouring agents may include any
   natural or artificial food colouring that is non-toxic and known in the art.
15 Exemplary colouring agents include, without limitation, Red No. 2, Red
   No. 3, Red No. 4, Red No. 22, Red No. 28, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 1,
   Yellow No.5, Yellow No. 6, Yellow No. 10, Green No. 3, Green No.
   5, Green No. 6, Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2, annatto, anthocyanins, beet
   extracts, beta-carotene, caramel, carmine/cochineal, paprika oleoresin,
20 and turmeric. Suitably, the jelly food product of the present invention
   comprises, by weight, about 0.01% to about 2% (e.g., about 0.01%,
   0.02%, 0.03%, 0.04%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.75%,
   1.0%, 1.25%, 1.5%, 1.75%, 2.0%) of a colouring agent.
           In particular embodiments, the jelly food product described herein
                                          11

   further includes a food grade flavouring agent. The flavouring agent may
   include one or more of those flavour agents known to the skilled artisan,
   such as natural and artificial flavours. Suitable flavouring agents include,
   but without limitation thereto, mints, such as peppermint, citrus flavours
 5 such as lime, orange and lemon, artificial vanilla, cinnamon, various fruit
   flavours, such as strawberry and mango, both individual and mixed, and
   the like. Suitably, the jelly food product of the present invention comprises,
   by weight, about 0.01% to about 2% (e.g., about 0.01%, 0.02%, 0.03%,
   0.04%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.75%, 1.0%, 1.25%,
10 1.5%, 1.75%, 2.0%) of a flavouring agent.
           In particular embodiments, the jelly food product further includes a
   protein source. More preferably, the protein is or comprises a hydrolysed
   protein. By "protein" is meant an amino acid polymer, including natural or
   non-natural amino acids, D- or L-amino acids as are well understood in
15 the art. The term "hydrolysed protein" refers to protein that has been
   subjected to hydrolysis to break down the protein into a mixture of
   peptides and free amino acids. Hydrolysis of proteins is commonly known
   and can be done by many different methods, for example by enzymatic
   hydrolysis by using an enzyme such as pancreatic protease to stimulate
20 the naturally occurring hydrolytic process. Hydrolysis may also be
   achieved by prolonged boiling in a strong acid or a strong base. In the
   context of the present invention, the partially hydrolysed protein may be
   produced by any suitable method known in the art. The hydrolysed protein
   may be derived, at least in part, from, for example, a non-human animal
                                          12

   protein (e.g., milk proteins, including caseins and whey proteins or
   peptides, meat proteins, egg proteins, extracellular matrix proteins, such
   as collagen), a non-animal protein, a dairy protein, a non-cow dairy
   protein, a non-dairy protein, a vegetable protein (e.g., sunflower protein,
 5 maize protein, rape seed protein, cotton seed protein, wheat protein, soy
   protein and rice), an algal protein, and any combination thereof.
           Suitably, the jelly food product of the present invention comprises,
   by weight, about 0.01% to about 2% (e.g., about 0.01%, 0.02%, 0.03%,
   0.04%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.75%, 1.0%, 1.25%,
10  1.5%, 1.75%, 2.0%) of a protein source, such as a hydrolysed protein.
            In a related aspect, the invention provides a method of preparing a
   jelly food product suitable for consumption by a patient with a mastication
   and/or deglutition disease, disorder or condition, including the steps of:
           (a) preparing a mixture comprising from about 10 to about 15 wt%
15 of a sugar, from about 0.5 to about 2.5 wt% of a gelling agent, from about
   0.1 to about 1.0 wt% of a metal salt and water;
           (b) heating the mixture to a temperature of between about 50'C
   and about 100'C;
           (c) mixing the mixture so as to hydrate the gelling agent; and
20         (d) cooling the mixture to a temperature of less than about 50'C, to
   thereby prepare the jelly food product.
           With respect to step (b), heating the mixture is suitably carried out
   at a temperature from about 50'C to 100'C, preferably about 55 0C to
   about 90 0C or any range therein, such as, but not limited to, about 65 0 C to
                                          13

   about 85 0C or about 60 0C to about 80 0 C. In particular embodiments, the
   mixture is heated to a temperature of about 50 0C, 51 0 C, 52 0C, 53 0C, 54 0C,
   55 0C, 56 0C, 57 0C, 58 0C, 59 0 C, 60 0 C, 61 0C, 62 0C, 63 0 C, 64 0 C, 65 0C, 66 0C,
   67 0C, 68 0C, 69 0C, 70 0C, 71 0 C, 72 0 C, 73 0C, 74 0C, 75 0 C, 76 0 C, 77 0C, 78 0C,
 5 79 0C, 80 0 C, 81 0 C, 82 0C, 83 0 C, 84 0 C, 85 0 C, 86 0C, 87 0 C, 88 0 C, 89 0 C, 900C,
   910C, 92 0C, 93 0C, 94 0 C, 95 0 C, 96 0C, 97 0C, 98 0C, 99 0 C, 100 0C and any
   range therein. In certain preferred embodiments, heat treatment is carried
   out at a temperature of about 70 0C to about 80'C.
           For the present aspect, the                gelling agent is suitably that
10 hereinbefore described. In certain embodiments, the gelling agent is
   selected from the group consisting of carrageenan, locust bean gum,
   xanthan gum and any combination thereof.
           Likewise, the metal salt of the present aspect is suitably that
   hereinbefore described. In particular embodiments, the metal salt is a
15 potassium salt.
           In one embodiment, the mixture further includes one or more of a
   colouring agent, a flavouring agent, a preservative agent, a hydrolysed
   protein and a food grade acid, such as those hereinbefore described. In
   this regard, it will be appreciated that the colouring agent, the flavouring
20 agent, the preservative agent, the hydrolysed protein and/or the food
   grade acid may be added to the mixture at any of steps (a) to (d) of the
   method of the present aspect. In one particular embodiment, the food
   grade acid, the colouring agent, and/or the flavouring agent are added to
   the mixture during or just prior to step (d) (i.e., the cooling step).
                                               14

           Suitably, for step (d), the mixture is cooled to less than about 50'C
   (e.g., less than about 50'C, 45'C, 40'C, 35'C, 30'C, 25 0C) and more
   preferably less than about 40'C, in less than about 60 minutes (e.g., less
   than about 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30 minutes) and more preferably less
 5 than about 45 minutes. In this regard, the time taken to cool the mixture to
   a temperature of less than about 50'C can be important with respect to
   producing a jelly food product that that does not fracture and/or is fracture
   resistant.
           In certain embodiments, the jelly food product at least partly melts
10 into a liquid form at a temperature of at least about 25 0 C, wherein the
   liquid form has a viscosity greater than about 95 cP.
           In referring to the above aspects, the jelly food product is suitably
   for feeding a subject suffering from a mastication and/or deglutition
   disease,    disorder or condition.      Preferably, the    mastication  and/or
15 deglutition disease, disorder or condition is or comprises dysphagia. It
   would be readily understood that dysphagia is a condition where the
   process of swallowing is impaired. During eating, this can lead to the entry
   of liquid or solid food into the trachea and subsequently the lungs of the
   sufferer potentially leading to aspiration pneumonia. Dysphagia can occur
20 at any age, but is most common in the elderly, especially if they have
   suffered a stroke or have dementia. One management strategy for suffers
   of dysphagia is to consume foods that are texture modified (i.e., thickened
   foods and beverages) that slow the swallowing reflex and allow the
   windpipe time to close before the food passes, thereby preventing
                                          15

   aspiration.
          Throughout the specification the aim has been to describe the
   preferred embodiments of the invention without limiting the invention to
   any one embodiment or specific collection of features. It will therefore be
 5 appreciated by those of skill in the art that, in light of the instant disclosure,
   various modifications and changes can be made in the particular
   embodiments exemplified without departing from the scope of the present
   invention.
          All computer programs, algorithms, patent and scientific literature
10 referred to herein is incorporated herein by reference.
          Any reference to publications cited in this specification is not an
   admission that the disclosures constitute common general knowledge in
   Australia.
          In order that the invention may be more readily understood and put
15 into practice, one or more preferred embodiments thereof will now be
   described, by way of example only.

   Example      1: Embodiments        of a jelly food product suitable for
   consumption by dysphagic patients
           The following three embodiments of a jelly food product were
   manufactured according to the process provided in Figure 1. These
 5 embodiments were determined            to be suitable for consumption by
   dysphagic patients as they do not fracture once in the mouth and pressure
   from the tongue is applied thereto.
           The present embodiments of dysphagia friendly jelly are not a
   traditional 'jelly' in they ares not made with gelatin which melts in the
10 mouth. As such, its formulation and therefore oral texture properties are
   quite different.        The below embodiments have been specifically
   engineered to be dysphagia friendly and meet Australian standard doc
   pS72 for foods and other items requiring special consideration for
   individuals with dysphagia which states that 'jelly may be excluded from
15 diets for individuals who require thickened fluids" because it particulates in
   the mouth if not swallowed promptly.
           The present embodiments of dysphagia friendly jelly pull neatly and
   cleanly with a spoon and therefore have the same look and feel of
   traditional 'jelly', however, unlike traditional jelly the present embodiments
20 of dysphagia friendly jelly hold in the mouth well with no 'melting' after 10
   20 seconds of oral hold. The jelly bolus is slippery and when pushed
   against the hard palate it deforms gently but does not break and
   particulate into bits making it is safe for people with dysphagia to swallow.
                                           17

   Furthermore, it encourages the person to swallow the bolus whole and the
   slippery nature means it is also easy for those with dysphagia to swallow.
            A jelly that is mildly or moderately thick is a drink - not a jelly. Jelly
   is a food that people are familiar with. It is slippery, yet holds together and
 5 offers an alternate way of hydrating. When the present embodiments of
   dysphagia friendly 'jelly' is held in the mouth saliva is stimulated and pools
   making it particularly good for those with dry mouth conditions due to
   medication side effects.
            The below embodiments also melt to a mild (i.e., 150 cP), moderate
10 (i.e., 400 cP) or extremely (i.e., 900 cP) thick liquid viscosity in the mouth,
   facilitating a safe swallow and limiting the risk of any aspiration thereof. In
   this regard, it was determined that the selection of particular gelling
   agents, metal salts, sugars as well as specific concentrations thereof that
   produce firm but not rigid gels that may fracture was important in the
15 preparation of suitable jelly food products.
   Results
           Typically, the sugar content of water gels being stabilised with
   carrageenan is 15-25% as this produces the desired firm rigid gel through
20 optimal concentration of carrageenan in the available water phase. Using
   a kappa carrageenan and at this sugar concentration, however, would
   produce a firm rigid gel that would fracture and thus not be suitable for
   feeding to patients with dysphagia. Surprisingly, this limitation was
                                           18

   overcome by keeping the sugar content between 10-15% w/w of the jelly
   food product.
           As can be observed in embodiment 2, the locust bean gum exhibits
   a synergistic behaviour when combined with the kappa carrageenan. This
 5 synergism creates gels that are less brittle and significantly more elastic
   and which have a higher gel strength. Concentration ranges of 0.3-0.5
   wt% for carrageenan optimise the desired gel fracture profile.
           From the embodiments, it was determined that the cooling step can
   be important with respect to the setting of the jelly food product and
10 achieving the desired fracture profile (i.e., little or no fracturing). At an
   application   pH    of   3.0-3.1,  kappa     carrageenan     undergoes   rapid
   autohydrolysis at the 3,6 anhydrogalactose linkage.             In the below
   embodiments, the gel was cooled to a temperature below its gelling
   temperature (40'C at the low ion concentration) so as to achieve the
15 desired dysphagia friendly gel structure with          little or no fracture.
   Hydrolysis increases about 3- fold for every 0.5 drop in temperature below
   the isoelectric point of the carrageenan. Thus, it can also very important
   that the acid be added as late as possible into the process and that the
   cups or containers filled with the jelly food product are cooled as rapidly as
20 possible to < 40'C, where the gel will subsequently set.
           The gel strength of the jelly food product is also determined by the
   stabilisation at the junction zones between individual molecules of the
   gelling agent (i.e., carrageenan, xanthan gum, locust bean gum) with K+
   ions. Typically, a kappa carrageenan gelling agent will provide a very firm
                                          19

rigid gel. Thus, the concentration of K+ ions at the junction zones needs to
be optimised so as the gel is firm and jelly-like but not so rigid that it
fractures.
