                                                BACKGROUND
Technical Field
[0001] This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2014201471, the
originally filed specification of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[0002] The disclosure relates generally to the field of marine geophysical surveying. More
particularly, the disclosure relates to systems and methods for controlling the spatial
distribution or orientation of geophysical sensor streamer or an array of geophysical sensor
streamers towed behind a survey vessel.
Description of the Related Art
[0003] Marine geophysical surveying systems such as seismic acquisition systems and
electromagnetic survey systems are used to acquire geophysical data from formations disposed
below the bottom of a body of water, such as a lake or the ocean. Marine seismic surveying
systems, for example, typically include a seismic survey vessel having onboard navigation,
seismic energy source control, and geophysical data recording equipment. The seismic survey
vessel is typically configured to tow one or more (typically a plurality) laterally spaced sensor
streamers through the water. At selected times, the seismic energy source control equipment
causes one or more seismic energy sources (which may be towed in the water by the seismic
vessel or by another vessel) to actuate. Signals generated by various sensors on the one or
more streamers in response to detected seismic energy are ultimately conducted to the
recording equipment. A record is made in the recording system of the signals generated by
each sensor (or groups of such sensors). The recorded signals are later interpreted to infer the
structure and composition of the formations below the bottom of the body of water.
Corresponding components for inducing electromagnetic fields and detecting electromagnetic
phenomena originating in the subsurface in response to such imparted fields may also be used
in marine electromagnetic geophysical survey systems.
[0004] The one or more sensor streamers are in the most general sense long cables that have
geophysical sensors disposed at spaced-apart positions along the length of the cables. A
typical streamer may extend behind the geophysical survey vessel for several kilometers.

                                                 -2
Because of the great length of the typical streamer, the streamer may not travel entirely in a
straight line behind the survey vessel at every point along its length due to interaction of the
streamer with the water, among other factors.
[0005] Streamers towed by a vessel configured for towing multiple streamers are generally
associated with equipment that maintains the forward ends of the streamers at selected lateral
distances from each other and from the centerline of the survey vessel as they are towed
through the water. Single streamers are generally used in what are known as two-dimensional
geophysical surveys, and multiple streamer systems are used in what are known as three
dimensional and four-dimensional surveys. A four-dimensional seismic survey is a three
dimensional survey over a particular area of the Earth's subsurface repeated at selected times.
The individual streamers in such systems are generally affected by the same forces that affect
a single streamer.
[0006] The quality of geophysical images of the Earth's subsurface produced from three
dimensional surveys is affected by how well the positions of the individual sensors on the
streamers are controlled. The quality of images generated from the detected signals also
depends to an extent on the relative positions of the sensors being maintained throughout the
geophysical survey.
[0007] Various embodiments of streamer control systems and methods are disclosed in U.S.
Patent Publication 2012/0002502, entitled "METHODS FOR GATHERING MARINE
GEOPHYSICAL DATA," which is incorporated by reference herein.

                                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0019] This specification includes references to "one embodiment" or "an embodiment." The
appearances of the phrases "in one embodiment" or "in an embodiment" do not necessarily
refer to the same embodiment. Particular features, structures, or characteristics may be
combined in any suitable manner consistent with this disclosure.
[0020] Terminology. The following paragraphs provide definitions and/or context for terms
found in this disclosure (including the appended claims):
[0021] "Based On." As used herein, this term is used to describe one or more factors that
affect a determination. This term does not foreclose additional factors that may affect a
determination. That is, a determination may be solely based on those factors or based only in
part on those factors. Consider the phrase "determine A based on B." This phrase connotes
that B is a factor that affects the determination of A, but does not foreclose the determination
of A from also being based on C. In other instances, A may be determined based solely on B.
[0022] "Configured To." As used herein, this term means that a particular piece of hardware
or software is arranged to perform a particular task or tasks when operated. Thus, a system that
is "configured to" perform task A means that the system may include hardware and/or
software that, during operation of the system, performs or can be used to perform task A. (As
such, a system can be "configured to" perform task A even if the system is not currently

                                                 -5
operating.)
[0023] "Orientation." As used herein, this term includes any information regarding the
geometric arrangement of a streamer. As non-limiting examples, the term "orientation" may
include the feather angle of a streamer relative to some reference axis, the shape of a streamer,
the position of a streamer relative to another streamer, or the position of a portion of a
streamer.
[0024] "Feather angle." As used herein, this term refers to the angle that a streamer makes
relative to some reference axis. Because a streamer may not always be arranged along a
perfectly straight line, this term should be interpreted to encompass any suitable way of
defining an average or approximate angle for such streamers. As non-limiting examples of
such methods, the "approximate direction" for a streamer might be defined as the line
connecting one end of the streamer to the other end; alternatively, the approximate direction
might be defined as a line of best fit, which might be calculated discretely or continuously in
various ways.
[0025] "Desired feather angle." As used herein, this term refers to the feather angle that an
operator or control system attempts to cause a streamer to make relative to a reference axis.
Typically, but not always, a "desired feather angle" will be a streamer orientation that is along
a straight line. As above, however, this term should also be interpreted to encompass any
suitable way of defining an average or approximate desired angle for such streamers.
[0026] "Automatic." As used herein, this term includes anything done by a hardware or
software control device.
[0027] "Coupled." As used herein, this term includes a connection between components,
whether direct or indirect.
[0028] "Lateral control device." As used herein, this term includes various devices for
positioning streamers laterally. In this disclosure, such devices may be referred to variously as
"lateral control devices," "lateral force control devices," "birds," "positioning devices,"
"lateral positioning devices," and "deflecting devices." These terms should also be understood
to encompass devices providing additional capabilities, such as depth control; for example,
terms such as "lateral force and depth control devices," "LFDs," and the like may also be used

to refer to such devices.
[0029] FIG. 1 shows a typical marine geophysical survey system that may include a plurality
of sensor streamers. Each of the sensor streamers may be guided through the water by one or
more lateral control devices coupled to each of the streamers. The geophysical survey system
includes survey vessel 10 that moves along the surface of body of water II such as a lake or
the ocean. Survey vessel 10 may include thereon equipment, shown generally at 12 and for
convenience collectively referred to as a "recording system." Recording system 12 typically
includes devices such as a data recording unit (not shown separately) for making a record with
respect to time of signals generated by various sensors in the acquisition system. Recording
system 12 also typically includes navigation equipment (not shown separately) to determine
and record, at selected times, the geodetic position of survey vessel 10, and, using other
devices to be explained below, each of a plurality of geophysical sensors 22 disposed at
spaced-apart locations on streamers 20 towed by survey vessel 10.
[0030] In one example, the device for determining the geodetic position may be geodetic
position signal receiver 12A such as a global positioning system ("GPS") receiver, shown
schematically at 12A. Other geodetic position determination devices are known in the art, such
as other global navigation satellite systems. The foregoing elements of recording system 12
are familiar to those skilled in the art, and with the exception of geodetic position detecting
receiver 12A, are not shown separately in the figures herein for clarity of the illustration.
[0031] Geophysical sensors 22 may be any type of geophysical sensor known in the art. Non
limiting examples of such sensors may include particle-motion-responsive seismic sensors
such as geophones and accelerometers, pressure-responsive seismic sensors, pressure-time
gradient-responsive seismic sensors, electrodes, magnetometers, temperature sensors or
combinations of the foregoing. In various implementations of the disclosure, geophysical
sensors 22 may measure, for example, seismic or electromagnetic field energy primarily
reflected from or refracted by various structures in the Earth's subsurface below the bottom of
body of water 11 in response to energy imparted into the subsurface by energy source 17.
Seismic energy, for example, may originate from a seismic energy source, or an array of such
sources, deployed in body of water 11 and towed by survey vessel 10 or by another vessel (not

R-~\d\rovN\RPrtb\DCC\)ER\6606473 I dc8/032018
                                               -7
shown). Electromagnetic energy may be provided by passing electric current through a wire
loop or electrode pair (not shown for clarity). The energy source (not shown) may be towed in
body of water 11 by survey vessel 10 or a different vessel (not shown). Recording system 12
may also include energy source control equipment (not shown separately) for selectively
operating energy source 17.
[0032] In the survey system shown in FIG. 1, there are four sensor streamers 20 towed by
survey vessel 10. The number of sensor streamers shown in FIG. 1, however, is only for
purposes of illustration and is not a limitation on the number of streamers that may be used in
any particular embodiment. As explained in the Background section herein, in marine
geophysical acquisition systems such as shown in FIG. I that include a plurality of laterally
spaced-apart streamers, streamers 20 are typically coupled to towing equipment that secures
the forward end of each of streamers 20 at a selected lateral position with respect to adjacent
streamers and with respect to survey vessel 10. As shown in FIG. 1, the towing equipment
may include two paravanes 14 coupled to survey vessel 10 via paravane tow ropes 8.
Paravanes 14 are the outermost components in the streamer spread and are used to provide
streamer separation.
[0033] Paravane tow ropes 8 are each coupled to survey vessel 10 at one end through winch
19 or a similar spooling device that enables changing the deployed length of each paravane
tow rope 8. In the embodiment shown, the distal end of each paravane tow rope 8 is coupled to
paravanes 14. Paravanes 14 are each shaped to provide a lateral component of motion to the
various towing components deployed in body of water 11 when paravanes 14 are moved
therethrough. The lateral motion component of each paravane 14 is opposed to that of the
other paravane 14. The combined lateral motion component of paravanes 14 separates
paravanes 14 from each other until they put into tension one or more spreader ropes or cables
24, coupled end to end between paravanes 14.
[0034] Streamers 20 may each be coupled, at the axial end thereof nearest survey vessel 10
(the "forward end"), to respective lead-in cable terminations 20A. Lead-in cable terminations
20A may be coupled to or associated with spreader ropes or cables 24 so as to fix the lateral
positions of streamers 20 with respect to each other and with respect to the centerline of
survey vessel 10. Electrical, optical, and/or any other suitable connection between the

R-~\d\rove\NRPrtb\DCC\)ER\6606473 Id-8/03/2018
                                               -8
appropriate components in recording system 12 and, ultimately, geophysical sensors 22
(and/or other circuitry) in the ones of streamers 20 inward of the lateral edges of the system
may be made using inner lead-in cables 18, each of which terminates in respective lead-in
cable termination 20A. Lead-in termination 20A is disposed at the forward end of each
streamer 20. Corresponding electrical, optical, and/or other suitable connection between the
appropriate components of recording system 12 and geophysical sensors 22 in the laterally
outermost streamers 20 may be made through respective lead-in terminations 20A, using
outermost lead-in cables 16. Each of innermost lead-in cables 18 and outermost lead-in cables
 16 may be deployed by respective winches 19 or similar spooling devices such that the
deployed length of each cable 16, 18 may be changed. The type of towing equipment coupled
to the forward end of each streamer shown in FIG. 1 is only intended to illustrate a type of
equipment that can tow an array of laterally spaced-apart streamers in the water. Other towing
structures may be used in other examples of geophysical acquisition system according to the
present disclosure.
[0035] The acquisition system shown in FIG. 1 may also include a plurality of lateral control
devices 26 coupled to each streamer 20 at selected positions along each streamer 20. Each
lateral control device 26 may include one or more rotatable control surfaces (not shown
separately in FIG. 1; see FIG. 2 for an exemplary embodiment) that when moved to a selected
rotary orientation with respect to the direction of movement of such surfaces through the water
 11 creates a hydrodynamic lift in a selected direction to urge streamer 20 in a selected
direction. Thus, such lateral control devices 26 may be used to maintain streamers 20 in a
selected orientation. The particular design of the lateral control devices 26, however, is not a
limit on the scope of the present disclosure.
[0036] In one embodiment, position determination devices may be associated with lateral
control devices 26. In one example, the position determination device may be an acoustic
range sensing device ("ARD") 26A. Such ARDs typically include an ultrasonic transceiver or
transmitter and electronic circuitry configured to cause the transceiver to emit pulses of
acoustic energy. Travel time of the acoustic energy between a transmitter and a receiver
disposed at a spaced-apart position such as along the same streamer and/or on a different
streamer, is related to the distance between the transmitter and a receiver, and the acoustic
velocity of the water. The acoustic velocity may be assumed not to change substantially during

R-~\d\rove\NRPrtb\DCC\)ER\6606473 I do 8/032018
                                                -9
a survey, or it may be measured by a device such as a water velocity test cell. Alternatively or
additionally, ARDs may be disposed at selected positions along each one of the streamers not
co-located with the lateral control devices 26. Such ARDs are shown at 23 in FIG. 1. Each
ARD 26A, 23 may be in signal communication with recording system 12 such that at any
moment in time the distance between any two ARDs 26A, 23 on any streamer 20 is
determinable. One or more ARDs may be placed at selected positions proximate the rear end
of survey vessel 10 so that relative distances between the selected positions on survey vessel
 10 and any of the ARDs on the streamers may also be determined.
[0037] Streamers 20 may additionally or alternatively include a plurality of heading sensors
29 disposed at spaced-apart positions along each streamer 20. Heading sensors 29 may be
geomagnetic direction sensors such as magnetic compass devices affixed to the exterior of
streamer 20. Heading sensors 29 provide a signal indicative of the heading (direction with
respect to magnetic north) of streamer 20 at the axial position of heading sensor 29 along the
respective streamer. Measurements of such heading at spaced-apart locations along each
streamer may be used to interpolate the orientation (including the spatial distribution) of each
streamer.
[0038] Each streamer 20 may include at the distal end thereof a tail buoy 25. Tail buoy 25
may include, among other sensing devices, geodetic position receiver 25A such as a GPS
receiver that may determine the geodetic position of each tail buoy 25. The geodetic position
receiver 25A in each tail buoy 25 may be in signal communication with recording system 12
[0039] By determining the distance between ARDs 26A, 23, including the one or more ARDs
on survey vessel 10, and/or by interpolating the spatial distribution of the streamers from
heading sensor 29 measurements, an estimate of the orientation of each streamer 20 may be
made. Collectively, the orientation of streamers 20 may be referred to as the "array
orientation."
[0040] The various position measurement components described above, including those from
heading sensors 29, from ARDs 26A, 23, and, if used, from additional geodetic position
receivers 25A in tail buoys 25, may be used individually or in any combination. The ARDs
and heading sensors may be referred to for convenience as "relative position determination"
sensors. By determining relative positions at each point along each streamer with reference to

R-~\d\trovn\RPrtbDCC\)ER\6606473 Id-8/03/2018
                                                - 10
a selected point on the survey vessel or the energy source, is it possible to determine the
geodetic position of each such streamer point if the geodetic position of the vessel or the
energy source is determined. As explained above, the navigation portion of recording system
 12 may include a GPS receiver or any other geodetic location receiver 12A. In some examples,
energy source 17 may also include a geodetic position location receiver 17A such as a GPS
receiver.
[0041] During operation of the geophysical acquisition system shown in FIG. 1, it may be
desirable to adjust portions of the streamers 20 laterally in order to maintain a desired streamer
orientation or array orientation during geophysical surveying. Recording system 12 may be
configured to send suitable control signals to each lateral control device 26 to move associated
portions of each streamer 20 laterally. Such lateral motion may be selected so that each point
along each streamer is located at a predetermined relative position at any moment in time. The
relative positions may be referenced to the position of either survey vessel 10 or energy source
 17. Examples of various array orientation control modes according to this disclosure are
provided below.
[0042] During operation of the acquisition system shown in FIG. 1 when used for seismic
surveying, for example, it may be desirable for streamers 20 to be arranged as evenly as
practicable behind survey vessel 10 to avoid holes in the survey coverage. "Evenly" or "even"
in the present context means that it is desirable that streamers 20 are parallel to each other
along their length, that there is equal lateral distance between adjacent streamers, and that the
streamers extend parallel to a selected direction. Deviation from such an even arrangement
may be caused by rip currents, crosscurrents, and propeller wash from survey vessel 10,
among other causes. Holes in the coverage is a condition wherein seismic sensors are disposed
more sparsely than would be the case if the orientation of the array were even, as defined
above.
[0043] For purposes of this disclosure, the term "parallel" may be defined in terms of the
"approximate directions" of streamers, as were discussed above. One of ordinary skill in the
art will recognize that different levels of parallelism may be sufficient for different purposes.
For example, in various embodiments, two streamers may be considered "parallel" if their
approximate directions differ by at most 0.10, 0.50, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 150, or 200. For

                                                - 11
purposes of this disclosure, "parallel" may be taken to mean "having approximate directions
within 5'," and "substantially parallel" may be taken to mean "having approximate directions
within 10'."
[0044] FIG. 2 shows an example of a bird 30 capable of providing lateral control to a
streamer.
[0045] Bird 30 includes attachment devices 32 for being coupled to a streamer 20. As streamer
20 and bird 30 move through the water, the angle of wing 34 about wing axis 33 determines
the amount of lateral force provided by bird 30 to streamer 20. This wing angle may be
controlled at a plurality of birds 30 attached to streamer 20 to provide the desired amount and
direction of lateral force at various points along the length of streamer 20, in order to change
the orientation of the streamer. Many different types of lateral control devices are known in
the art, and bird 30 is provided only as an example of such a device.
[0046] FIG. 3 shows exemplary reference axes relative to which a streamer feather angle may
be measured. The heading of survey vessel 10 is one viable choice, shown as heading axis 50.
In the figures that follow, heading axis 50 will be used; other options, as discussed below, are
also possible.
[0047] In the presence of crosscurrent 52, the actual direction of travel of survey vessel 10
may differ from its heading; thus direction of travel may also be a useful reference axis. This
is shown as direction of travel axis 54. Other possibilities include true north 56 and magnetic
north 58. Other possibilities (not shown) include the streamer-front-end direction and the
preplot direction for the survey. What is meant by "preplot direction" is the ideal track of the
vessel. For example, in a 3D survey, the preplot lines are typically equally distributed, parallel
(or substantially parallel) lines along the survey area, separated by a distance equal to the
width of the area covered in one pass. In a 4D survey, the preplot direction typically follows
the actual previous track of the vessel. The preplot direction thus may be constant (such as for
each line of a 3D survey) or variable (such as in 4D surveys).
[0048] In some embodiments, the preplot lines may be circular. For example, the ideal track
of the vessel may be a series of overlapping, continuously linked circles. The circles may
have approximately the same focus or different foci. In these embodiments, the paths of
streamers 20 are equally distributed over a predetermined area around the preplot line. For

R-~\d\rove\NRPrtb\DCC\)ER\6606473 I dc8/032018
                                               - 12
example, streamers 20 can be equally distributed across a predetermined lateral width.
[0049] Some of the more common choices for a reference axis have been provided; however,
a reference axis may be any suitable axis and merely provides a frame of reference for
measuring streamer feather angles.
[0050] FIG. 4A shows survey vessel 10 towing a plurality of streamers 20. For simplicity,
paravanes 14, paravane tow ropes 8, lead-in cables 16 and 18, lead-in cable terminations 20A,
and spreader ropes or cables 24 are not shown separately in this figure or the figures that
follow. These various components have been combined into rigging 64. Further, the various
devices along the length of streamers 20 have been omitted for simplicity.
[0051] As shown, heading axis 50 has been chosen as the reference axis in this example.
Streamers 20 are shown oriented at initial feather angle 62 relative to heading axis 50. Control
equipment (not shown) may be configured to control the birds arranged along each streamer
20 to provide the necessary wing angles to maintain a particular feather angle. It is typically
desirable to have streamers at a feather angle near zero (relative to either heading axis 50 or
direction of travel axis 54). With crosscurrents, however, a feather angle of zero may not
always be feasible. Further, crosscurrents may vary, both as a function of time as the survey
progresses, and as a function of position along the length of streamers 20. Thus in some
instances, a bird may experience a particularly strong crosscurrent that must be counteracted to
maintain the feather angle. Accordingly, some birds may have to use excessive wing angles to
provide the required amount of force to maintain a particular feather angle and/or streamer
orientation. Increasing the amount of force produced by a bird tends to increase the turbulence
and noise generated thereby, which may negatively impact the quality of the data gathered in
the survey. Accordingly, in some situations, it may be desirable to decrease the noise
generated by the birds by changing the feather angle. In one embodiment, this change may
involve increasing the feather angle.
[0052] According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, changing the feather angle
may be carried out by attempting to determine a feather angle that reduces the sum of the
forces generated by the birds (or by any chosen subset of the birds, or the force generated by a
particular bird). In some embodiments, a feather angle may be determined to attempt to
minimize or significantly reduce such forces. Because minimization may not always be

R-~\d\rove\NRPrtb\DCC\)ER\6606473 Ido 8/03/2018
                                                - 13
possible or feasible, approximate minimization may be an acceptable alternative to
minimization. Various levels of approximate minimization may be considered sufficient in
various embodiments. For example, the maximum force that can be applied by a bird may be
taken to be 100%, and the actual minimum force possible may be taken to be 0%. For
purposes of this disclosure, however, the term "minimization" should be interpreted to include
anything less than or equal to 5% of the maximum force. The term "approximate
minimization" should be interpreted to include anything less than or equal to 20% of the
maximum force. In various other embodiments, it may be considered sufficient for the value to
be anything less than or equal to 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%,
30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, or 50% of the maximum force.
[0053] In this way, a desired feather angle reducing, minimizing, or approximately
minimizing a desired force or a desired force sum may be determined. This desired feather
angle will tend to simply follow the average crosscurrent. This embodiment may be useful in
situations where the actual feather angle is not of particular importance, but minimizing bird
noise is important. Bird noise may typically be a larger concern than feather angle, one of
ordinary skill in the art will understand the tradeoff between steering and acceptable noise
level. Further, in some cases it may not be possible or feasible to reach a desired feather angle
due to strong crosscurrents; in such cases, it may be advantageous to use a strategy that allows
the feather angle to follow the average crosscurrent, keeping the streamers straight and
correctly separated.
[0054] FIG. 4B shows the same elements as FIG. 4A, but feather angle 62 has been adjusted
to new feather angle 72, which is increased relative to feather angle 62. The actual angles
depicted are not necessarily to scale. The increase from feather angle 62 to new feather angle
72 is typically carried out in order to reduce the forces generated by the birds. However, the
pursuit of various objectives may lead to different values for new feather angle 72.
[0055] As described above, the increase in feather angle typically leads to a reduction in bird
forces. This force reduction may be carried out one time, continuously, or periodically based
on the bird forces. In one embodiment, the force reduction may be based on the instantaneous
(e.g., momentary) forces produced by the birds. Additionally, force reduction may include a
time-filtering, time-averaging, and/or force integration aspect in order to suppress any

R-~\d\rove\NRPrtb\DCC\)ER\6606473 I dc8/032018
                                               - 14
potential instability and/or oscillations in the determined desired feather angle that may be
caused by adjustments to the feature angle every second where short-duration (e.g., on the
scale of one-second) changes in crosscurrents may have an undesirably large impact on the
desired feather angle. For example, the forces being produced by the birds may be averaged
over a 30-second time interval, a 60-second time interval, a two-minute time interval, or any
other suitable interval, to determine a desired feather angle that is less dependent upon
momentary fluctuations in crosscurrents and bird forces.
[0056] A desired feather angle may be determined not simply to reduce, minimize, or
approximately minimize bird forces, but to maintain them below some desired threshold value
while keeping the desired feather angle as close as possible to some reference feather angle
(e.g., a predefined ideal value). In this embodiment, the feather angle adjustment also may be
carried out one time, continuously, or periodically based on the bird forces. The feather angle
may also be based on the instantaneous (e.g. momentary) forces produced by the birds;
however, the feather angle may include a time-filtering, time-averaging, and/or force
integration aspect in order to suppress instability and/or oscillations in the determined desired
feather angle. This embodiment may be useful in situations where a tradeoff between an
optimal feather angle and noise produced by bird forces is desired.
[0057] These embodiments of reducing bird forces or maintaining bird forces below a
threshold may also depend on certain other conditions. For example, the control system might
require operator confirmation before implementing a feather angle change. In some
embodiments, the control system may allow feather angle changes only at the end of a survey
line and before the next survey line begins, in order to provide a consistent feather angle for
each survey line.
[0058] FIGS. 5A and 5B show another embodiment of adapting streamer orientation in
response to forces being produced by the birds. In FIG. 5A, survey vessel 10 is towing
streamers 20 at an initial feather angle of approximately zero, relative to heading axis 50. This
configuration may be desirable when crosscurrents are relatively small to give good survey
coverage.
[0059] As noted above, however, crosscurrents may vary not just with time, but also along the
length of streamers 20. As shown in FIG. 5B, a strong crosscurrent at the forward portion of

R-~\d\rove\NRPrtb\DCC\)ER\6606473 Ido 8/03/2018
                                                     - 15
streamers 20 has deflected the forward portion of streamers 20 to some extent. However,
survey vessel 10 has not travelled far enough for the rear portion of streamers 20 to have
encountered this crosscurrent yet. In a situation such as this, it may be desirable to adapt the
streamer feather angle to take into account the fact that the rear portions of streamers 20 are
likely to experience a similar crosscurrent, but at a later time. Thus, a desired feather angle
may be chosen to proactively position the rear portions of streamers 20 along a feather angle
that takes into account this strong crosscurrent. Accordingly, the control system has
determined new desired feather angle 82.
[0060] Bird forces along the length of streamers 20 may then be determined in order to
identify a desired orientation for the streamer in a straight line at a new desired feather angle
82. It is appreciated that while a perfectly straight line may be the optimal arrangement for a
streamer, no such perfectly straight line exists in nature. Accordingly, minor deviations from
perfection may be considered acceptable here. It is further appreciated that while the desired
orientation may in fact be a perfectly straight line, in the real world the actual orientation will
always be an approximation thereof.
[0061] By way of example, one method of quantifying the "straightness" of a streamer might
be as follows. Let "Lactuai" be defined as the distance between the two ends of the streamer as
they are positioned in the water (i.e. the length of the streamer in its actual configuration). Let
"Lstraight"     be defined as the length the streamer would have if it were completely straight (i.e.
the ideal length of the streamer). The streamer's straightness "S" can then be defined as S =
Lactuai    / Lstraight. Under this definition, S can be seen as a percentage value that indicates how
"close" to being straight the streamer is. In various embodiments, it might be sufficient for a
streamer to have an S value of 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%,
97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, or 100%.
[0062] For purposes of this disclosure, the term "straight" may be taken to mean an S value of
90% or more. The term "approximately straight" may be taken to mean an S value of 80% or
more.
[0063] Bird forces 84, 86, 88, 90, and 92 are shown as distinct in FIG 5B in order to illustrate
that various forces may be desired at different positions along the length of streamers 20, and
they need not be the same as one another. By using the predictive aspect of this embodiment,

R-~\d\rove\NRPrtb\DCC\)ER\6606473 I dc8/032018
                                               - 16
the peak forces required from the birds may be reduced.
[0064] FIG. 5B illustrates the above-described situation by showing the case where the
crosscurrent is strong enough that the birds attached to the forward portion of streamers 20 are
unable to maintain the feather angle of zero (or whatever the initial feather angle may have
been). A similar situation may occur, however, when the birds attached to the forward portion
of streamers 20 are able to maintain the initial feather angle, but only by producing
undesirably large lateral forces. In that situation as well, it may be desirable for the control
system to determine new desired feather angle 82.
[0065] It should be noted that, while the above discussion focuses on the use of forces
produced by birds in determining a desired streamer feather angle or orientation, various other
quantities may also be used as a substitute for force. For example, configuration data for the
birds may be a useful proxy for force. Configuration data may include information regarding
the wing angles of birds, or other information indicative of the birds' current state or indicative
of how much force or noise the birds are outputting to maintain a feather angle and/or streamer
orientation. Further, configuration data may include any information indicative of
crosscurrents, including but not limited to direct measurement of crosscurrents.
[0066] FIG. 6 shows an exemplary process flow for an embodiment according to the present
disclosure.
[0067] At step 100, a streamer is towed in a body of water. At this step in this process flow,
the streamer has an initial orientation. The initial orientation may be a straight line at a
particular feather angle relative to some reference axis, or it may be an approximately straight
line at an approximate feather angle, or it may be a non-linear orientation.
[0068] At step 102, information relating to crosscurrents in the body of water is received. As
discussed above, this information may be based on forces produced by devices along the
streamer, or based on configuration data, or based on any source of information related to
crosscurrents.
[0069] At step 104, a desired streamer orientation is determined, based on the received
information relating to the crosscurrents. For example, the desired orientation may be a
straight line at a feather angle that follows the average crosscurrents in the body of water.

R-~\d\rove\NRrtb\DCC\)ER\!6606473 I dc8/032018
                                               - 17
[0070] At step 106, the orientation of the streamer is adjusted based on the determined desired
streamer orientation. This adjustment may be carried out via positioning devices (e.g. birds)
along the length of the streamer.
[0071] FIG. 7 shows another exemplary process flow for an embodiment according to the
present disclosure.
[0072] At step 120, a streamer is towed in a body of water at an initial feather angle. The
streamer may include, among other components, a plurality of deflecting devices arranged at
various positions along its length for providing forces to the streamer.
[0073] At step 122, information relating to forces produced by the deflecting devices along the
length of the streamer is received. These forces may be the forces needed to maintain the
streamer at its initial feather angle. This received information may be related to direct or
indirect measurements of such forces, and it may be based on data received from the plurality
of deflecting devices.
[0074] At step 124, a new desired streamer feather angle is automatically determined. As
discussed in more detail above, the desired streamer feather angle may be determined in order
to reduce the amount of force necessary from the plurality of deflecting devices, to
predictively place the streamer in an advantageous orientation based on measured crosscurrent
conditions, or in any other way that takes account of forces output by the plurality of
deflecting devices. The new desired streamer feather angle may be a straight line measured
relative to a reference axis. The automatic determination may be made without user input or
interaction.
[0075] At step 126, the streamer orientation is automatically adjusted based on the new
streamer feather angle. Prior to the automatic adjustment, the control system may or may not
require user input and/or confirmation. This adjustment may be carried out via deflecting
devices along the length of the streamer.
