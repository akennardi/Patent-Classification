    METHODS OF REDUCING THE RISK OF A CARDIOVASCULAR EVENT IN A
                               SUBJECT ON STATIN THERAPY
                                         PRIORITY CLAIM
[0001]      This application is a divisional of Australian application no. 2013282394, filed June
28, 2013, which derives from PCT/US2013/048559, and claims priority to U.S. provisional
patent application serial no. 61/666,447, filed June 29, 2012, the entire contents of which are
incorporated herein by reference.
                                          BACKGROUND
[0002]      Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and
most European countries. It is estimated that over 70 million people in the United States alone
suffer from a cardiovascular disease or disorder including but not limited to high blood
pressure, coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, congestive heart failure and stroke.
[0003]      Lovaza@, a lipid regulating agent, is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce
triglyceride levels in adult patients with very high triglyceride levels. Unfortunately, Lovaza@
can significantly increase LDL-C and/or non-HDL-C levels in some patients. A need exists for
improved treatments for cardiovascular diseases and disorders.
                                            SUMMARY
[0004]      In various embodiments, the present invention provides methods of reducing the
risk of a cardiovascular event in a subject on statin therapy. In one embodiment, the method
comprises administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising about 1 g to
about 4 g of eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester or a derivative thereof. In another embodiment,
the subject has a fasting baseline triglyceride level of about 135 mg/dL to about 500 mg/dL. In
another embodiment, the composition contains not more than 10%, by weight,
docosahexaenoic acid or derivative thereof, substantially no docosahexaenoic acid or
derivative thereof, or no docosahexaenoic acid or derivative thereof. In another embodiment,
eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester comprises at least 96%, by weight, of all fatty acids present in
the composition; the
                                                   1

composition contains not more than 4%, by weight, of total fatty acids other than
eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester; and/or the composition contains about 0.1% to about
0.6% of at least one fatty acid other than eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester and
docosahexaenoic acid.
[0005]     In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating
hypertriglyceridemia comprising administering a composition as described herein to a
subject in need thereof one to about four times per day.
[0006]     These and other embodiments of the present invention will be disclosed in
further detail herein below.
                               DETAILED DESCRIPTION

[0027]      In some embodiments, the subject's statin therapy does not include
administration of 200 mg or more per day of niacin and/or fibrates. In some
embodiments, the subject is not on concomitant omega-3 fatty acid therapy (e.g., is not
being administered or co-administered a prescription and/or over-the-counter
composition comprising an omega-3 fatty acid active agent). In some embodiments,
the subject is not administered or does not ingest a dietary supplement comprising an
omega-3 fatty acid.
[0028]      In some embodiments, the subject has established cardiovascular disease
("CV disease" or "CVD"). The status of a subject as having CV disease can be
determined by any suitable method known to those skilled in the art. In some
embodiments, a subject is identified as having established CV disease by the presence
of any one of: documented coronary artery disease, documented cerebrovascular
disease, documented carotid disease, documented peripheral arterial disease, or
combinations thereof. In some embodiments, a subject is identified as having CV
disease if the subject is at least 45 years old and: (a) has one or more stenosis of
greater than 50% in two major epicardial coronary arteries; (b) has had a documented
prior MI; (c) has been hospitalized for high-risk NSTE ACS with objective evidence of
ischemia (e.g., ST-segment deviation and/or biomarker positivity); (d) has a

[0029]      In some embodiments, the subject or subject group being treated in
accordance with methods of the invention has a high risk for developing CV disease.
For example and without limitation, a subject or subject group has a high risk for
developing CV disease if the subject or subject in a subject group is age 50 or older,
has diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or Type 2), and at least one of: (a) is a male age 55 or
older or a female age 65 or older; (b) is a cigarette smoker or was a cigarette smoker
who stopped less than 3 months prior; (c) has hypertension (e.g., a blood pressure of
140 mmHg systolic or higher, or greater than 90 mmHg diastolic); (d) has an HDL-C
level of < 40 mg/dL for men or < 50 mg/dL for women; (e) has an hs-CRP level of
> 3.0 mg/L; (f) has renal dysfunction (e.g., a creatinine clearance ("CrCL") of greater
than 30 mL/min and less than 60 mL/min); (g) has retinopathy (e.g., defined as any of:
non-proliferative retinopathy, preproliferative retinopathy, proliferative retinopathy,
maculopathy, advanced diabetic eye disease, or history of photocoagulation); (h) has

successive occasions); and/or (j) has an ankle-brachial index of < 0.9 without
symptoms of intermittent claudication.
[0030]      In some embodiments, the subject's baseline lipid profile is measured or
determined prior to administering the pharmaceutical composition to the subject.
Lipid profile characteristics can be determined by any suitable method known to those
skilled in the art including, for example, by testing a fasting or non-fasting blood
sample obtained from the subject using standard blood lipid profile assays. In some
                                             12

embodiments, the subject has one or more of: a baseline non-HDL-C value of about
200 mg/dL to about 300 mg/dL; a baseline total cholesterol value of about 250 mg/dL
to about 300 mg/dL; a baseline VLDL-C value of about 140 mg/dL to about 200
mg/dL; a baseline HDL-C value of about 10 to about 30 mg/dL; and/or a baseline
LDL-C value of about 40 to about 100 mg/dL.

[0061]       In some embodiments, the reduced risk of CV events is indicated or
determined by comparing an amount of time (e.g., an average amount of time)
associated with a subject or subject group from first dosing to a first CV event selected
from the group consisting of: CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, coronary
revascularization, and hospitalization (e.g., emergent hospitalization) for unstable
angina determined to be caused by myocardial ischemia (e.g., by invasive or non
invasive testing), to an amount of time (e.g., an average amount of time) associated
with a placebo or untreated subject or group of subjects from first dosing with a
placebo to a first CV event selected from the group consisting of: CV death, nonfatal
MI, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospitalization (e.g., emergent
hospitalization) for unstable angina determined to be caused by myocardial ischemia
(e.g., by invasive or non-invasive testing), wherein said placebo does not include
eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester. In some embodiments, the amount of time
associated with the subject or group of subjects are compared to the amount of time
associated with the placebo or untreated subject or group of subjects are compared

about 1 g of a composition as described herein, are administered to the subject in the
evening, for example between about 5 pm and about 11 pm.
[0069]      In some embodiments, the risk of a cardiovascular event in a subject is
reduced compared to a control population. In some embodiments, a plurality of
control subjects to a control population, wherein each control subject is on stable statin
                                             18

therapy, has a fasting baseline triglyceride level of about 135 mg/dL to about 500
mg/dL, and has established cardiovascular disease or a high risk of developing
cardiovascular disease, and wherein the control subjects are not administered the
pharmaceutical composition comprising about 1 g to about 4 g of eicosapentaenoic
acid ethyl ester per day.
[0070]      In some embodiments, a first time interval beginning at (a) an initial
administration of a composition as disclosed herein to the subject to (b) a first
cardiovascular event of the subject is greater than or substantially greater than a first
control time interval beginning at (a') initial administration of a placebo to the control
subjects to (b') a first cardiovascular event in the control subjects. In some
embodiments, the first cardiovascular event of the subject is a major cardiovascular
event selected from the group consisting of: cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial
infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, and unstable angina caused by
myocardial ischemia. In some embodiments, the first cardiovascular event of the
control subjects is a major cardiovascular event selected from the group consisting of:
cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary
revascularization, and unstable angina caused by myocardial ischemia. In some
embodiments, the first cardiovascular event of the subject and the first cardiovascular
event of the control subjects is any of: death (from any cause), nonfatal myocardial
infarction, or nonfatal stroke. In some embodiments, the first cardiovascular event of
the subject and the first cardiovascular event of the control subjects is any of: death
from a cardiovascular cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary

revascularization, unstable angina. In some embodiments, the first cardiovascular
event of the subject and the first cardiovascular event of the control subjects is any of:
death from a cardiovascular cause and nonfatal myocardial infarction. In some
embodiments, the first cardiovascular event of the subject and the first cardiovascular
event of the control subjects is death (from any cause). In some embodiments, the first
cardiovascular event of the subject and the first cardiovascular event of the control
                                              19

subjects is any of: fatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal myocardial infarction
(optionally including silent MI). In some embodiments, the first cardiovascular event
of the subject and the first cardiovascular event of the control subjects is coronary
revascularization. In some embodiments, the first cardiovascular event of the subject
and the first cardiovascular event of the control subjects is hospitalization (e.g.
emergent hospitalization) for unstable angina (optionally unstable angina caused by
myocardial ischemia). In some embodiments, the first cardiovascular event of the
subject and the first cardiovascular event of the control subjects is any one of: fatal
stroke or nonfatal stroke. In some embodiments, the first cardiovascular event of the
subject and the first cardiovascular event of the control subjects is any one of: new
coronary heart failure, new coronary heart failure leading to hospitalization, transient
ischemic attack, amputation for coronary vascular disease, and carotid
revascularization. In some embodiments, the first cardiovascular event of the subject
and the first cardiovascular event of the control subjects is any one of: elective
coronary revascularization and emergent coronary revascularization. In some
embodiments, the first cardiovascular event of the subject and the first cardiovascular
event of the control subjects is an onset of diabetes. In some embodiments, the first
cardiovascular event of the subject and the first cardiovascular event of the control
subjects is cardiac arrhythmia requiring hospitalization. In some embodiments, the
first cardiovascular event of the subject and the first cardiovascular event of the control
subjects is cardiac arrest.
[0071]      In some embodiments, a second time interval beginning at (a) an initial
administration of the pharmaceutical composition to the subject to (c) a second
cardiovascular event of the subject is greater than or substantially greater than a second
control time interval beginning at (a') initial administration of a placebo to the control
subjects to (c') a second cardiovascular event in the control subjects. In some
embodiments, the second cardiovascular event of the subject and the second
cardiovascular event of the control subjects is a major cardiovascular event selected
from the group consisting of: cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction,
nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, and unstable angina caused by myocardial
ischemia.
                                              20

[0072]      In some embodiments, the subject has diabetes mellitus and the control
subjects each have diabetes mellitus. In some embodiments, the subject has metabolic
syndrome and the control subjects each have metabolic syndrome.
[0073]      In some embodiments, the subject exhibits one or more of (a) reduced
triglyceride levels compared to the control population; (b) reduced Apo B levels
compared to the control population; (c) increased HDL-C levels compared to the
control population; (d) no increase in LDL-C levels compared to the control
population; (e) a reduction in LDL-C levels compared to the control population; (f) a

VLDL levels compared to the control population; (h) a reduction in total cholesterol
levels compared to the control population; (i) a reduction in high sensitivity C-reactive
protein (hs-CRP) levels compared to the control population; and/or (j) a reduction in
high sensitivity troponin (hsTnT) levels compared to the control population.
[0074]      In some embodiments, the subject's weight after administration of the
composition is less than a baseline weight determined before administration of the
composition. In some embodiments, the subject's waist circumference after
administration of the composition is less than a baseline waist circumference
determined before administration of the composition.
[0075]      In methods of the present invention in which a time interval is determined or
assessed, the time interval may be for example an average, a median, or a mean time
interval. For example, in embodiments wherein a first control time interval is
associated with a plurality of control subjects, the first control time interval is an
average, a median, or a mean of a plurality of first control time intervals associated
with each control subject. Similarly, in embodiments wherein a second control time
interval is associated with a plurality of control subjects, the second control time
interval is an average, a median, or a mean of a plurality of second control time
intervals associated with each control subject.
[0076]      In some embodiments, the reduced risk of cardiovascular events is
expressed as a difference in incident rates between a study group and a control
population. In some embodiments, the subjects in the study group experience a first
                                             21

major cardiovascular event after an initial administration of a composition as disclosed
herein at a first incidence rate which is less than a second incidence rate, wherein the
second incidence rate is associated with the rate of cardiovascular events in the
subjects in the control population. In some embodiments, the first major
cardiovascular event is any one of: cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial
infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospitalization for unstable
angina (optionally determined to be caused by myocardial ischemia). In some
embodiments, the first and second incidence rates are determined for a time period
beginning on the date of the initial administration and ending about 4 months, about 1
year, about 2 years, about 3 years, about 4 years, or about 5 years after the date of
initial administration.
[0077]     In another embodiment, the invention provides use of any composition
described herein for treating hypertriglyceridemia in a subject in need thereof,
comprising: providing a subject having a fasting baseline triglyceride level of about
135 mg/dL to about 500 mg/dL and administering to the subject a pharmaceutical
composition as described herein. In one embodiment, the composition comprises
about 1 g to about 4 g of eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester, wherein the composition
contains substantially no docosahexaenoic acid.
                                       EXAMPLES
[0078]     A phase 3, multi-center, placebo-controlled randomized, double-blind, 12
week study with an open-label extension is performed to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of AMR1O1 in patients with fasting triglyceride levels > 150 mg/dL and < 500

Study Population
[0092]      The population for this study is men and women >45 years of age with
established CVD, or men and women >50 years of age with diabetes in combination
with one additional risk factor for CVD. In addition, all patients will have atherogenic
dyslipidemia defined as on treatment for hypercholesterolemia (but at treatment goal
for LDL-C, by treatment with a statin) and hypertriglyceridemia. More details are
listed in the inclusion criteria.
[0093]      The patients will need to provide consent to participate in the study and be
willing and able to comply with the protocol and the study procedures.
Study Periods
[0094]      This study consists of the following study periods:
                                             24

[0095]      Screening Period: During the screening period, patients will be evaluated for
inclusion/exclusion criteria.
[0096]      At the first visit to the Research Unit (Visit 1), study procedures will be
performed for evaluation of patient's eligibility in the study. At this screening visit,
patients will sign an informed consent form before any study procedure is performed;
the informed consent form will cover the treatment/follow-up period. Based on the
evaluation from Visit 1, the following situations may occur:
[0097]      Patients who are eligible for participation based on the study procedures on
Visit 1 will return to the Research Unit for Visit 2 (randomization visit) to start the
treatment/follow-up period. This case includes, for example, patients at Visit lwho are
on a stable dose of a statin, are planning to stay on the same statin and the same dose
of the statin, and who not need to wash out any non-statin lipid-altering medications.
[0098]      Patients who are not eligible for participation based on the study procedures
on Visit 1 and are unlikely to become eligible in the next 28 days (for example:
unlikely to stabilize statin dose, unable to wash out non-statin lipid-altering
medications, etc.): these patients will be screen failed after Visit 1.
[0099]      Patients not eligible for participation in the study based on the study
procedures on Visit 1 may possibly become eligible in the next 28 days: these patients
may return at the discretion of the investigator for a second optional screening visit
(Visit 1.1) at which time the procedures needed for re-evaluation of the previously
failed inclusion/exclusion criteria will be repeated. This case includes, for example,
patients who are started on a statin at Visit 1, whose statin dose is changed at Visit 1,
and/or needed to wash out non-statin lipid-altering medications. The following applies
for these patients:
[0100]      Patients with a change in the statin or statin dose on Visit 1 will need to be
on a stable statin dose for at least 28 days before the lipid qualifying measurements at
Visit 1.1. Other concomitant medications (antidiabetic therapy, for example) can be
optimized or stabilized during this period.
                                               25

[0101]      Patients starting a washout at Visit 1 will have a washout period of at least
28 days (only 7 days for bile acid sequestrants) before the lipid qualifying
measurements at Visit 1.1.
[0102]      Patients at Visit 1 who are on a stable dose of a statin, are planning to stay
on the same statin at the same dose, and who do not need any medication washout, but
were asked to return for Visit 1.1 to repeat one or more of the other study procedures
not related to concomitant medications
[0103]      Patients who become eligible for participation based on the additional study
procedures at Visit 1.1 will return to the Research Unit for Visit 2 (randomization
visit) to start the treatment/follow-up period.
[0104]      At the end of the screening period, patients will need to meet all
inclusion/exclusion criteria before they can be randomized. Patients who are not
eligible for participation after the screening period (based on study procedures at Visit
1 and/or Visit 1.1) may return at a later date for rescreening. These patients will need
to re-start with all procedures starting with Visit 1. This includes patients who need
more time to stabilize one or more conditions or therapies (for example: statin,
antidiabetic, antihypertensive, thyroid hormone, HIV-protease inhibitor therapy).
[0105]      Treatment/Follow-Up Period: Within 42 days after the first screening visit
(Visit 1) or within 60 days after the first screening visit (Visit 1) for those patients that
have a second screening visit (Visit 1.1), eligible patients will enter the
treatment/follow-up period. During this period, the patients will receive study drug
during the planned visits at the Research Site and take the study drug while away from
the Research Site.
[0106]      During the visits, study procedures will be performed for evaluation of
efficacy and safety. A detailed schedule of procedures is provided in Table 1.
Study Duration
[0107]      The estimated study duration includes a planned 18-month enrollment
period followed by a follow-up period of approximately 3.5 years in expected duration
                                              26

(approximately 5 years in total). Patients will be randomized at different times during
the enrollment period but will all end the study at the same date (study end date). It is
planned that all randomized patients will receive study medication and be followed-up
until the study end date. This is an event-driven trial and patients will continue in the
trial if the trial runs longer than expected, or will terminate earlier if the trial runs
shorter than expected.
[0108]       The total duration of the trial is based on a median 4-year follow-up period
across patients. The first patient randomized would be followed for 4.75 years (the
longest individual follow-up duration), and the last patient randomized would be
followed for 3.25 year (the shortest individual follow-up duration).
Study Groups
[0109]       At Visit 2 (Day 0), eligible study patients will be randomly assigned to the
following treatment groups:
[0110]       Group 1: AMR1O1 4 g daily (four 1000 mg capsules daily)
[0111]       Group 2: placebo (four capsules daily)
[0112]       The four AMR1O1 or placebo capsules daily will be taken as two capsules
in the morning and two capsules in the evening (twice-per-day dosing regimen).
Number of Patients
[0113]       This is an event-driven trial: It is expected that a minimum of 1612 primary
efficacy endpoint events will be required during the study. A total of approximately
7990 patients will be entered into the study to either receive AMR1O1 or placebo
(approximately 3995 patients per treatment group) in order to observe an estimated
1612 events that make up the primary composite endpoint for efficacy.
Number of Study Sites
[0114]       Participants will be enrolled at multiple Research Sites in multiple countries.
Randomization
                                                27

[0115]      On Day 0, eligible patients will be randomized to one of 2 study groups
using a computer-generated randomization schema. Randomized treatment assignment
to either AMR101 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio will be provided using the internet (IWR).
Blinding
[0116]      This is a double-blind study. Patients, investigators, pharmacists and other
supporting staff at the Research Sites, personnel and designees of the Sponsor, study
administrators and personnel at the organization(s) and vendors supporting the study
will be unaware of the randomization code (i.e., they will not know which study
participants are receiving the experimental drug and which are receiving the placebo
drug). The study medication AMR1O1 and placebo capsules will be similar in size and
appearance to maintain blinding.
[0117]      During the double-blind treatment/follow-up period, everyone (patients,
investigators, pharmacists and other supporting staff at the Research Sites, personnel
and designees of the Sponsor, study administrators and personnel at the organization(s)
and vendors managing/supporting the study), with the exception of the laboratory
personnel performing the analysis, will be blinded to individual results of the efficacy
laboratory measurements (including lipid values). Individual results from the lipid
profile may be unblinded in the event of an emergency for a patient.
Stratification
[0118]      Participants will be assigned to treatment groups stratified by CV risk
category, use of ezetimibe and by geographical region (Westernized, Eastern
European, and Asia Pacific countries). There are two CV risk categories:
[0119]      CV Risk Category 1: patients with established CVD defined in the inclusion
criteria. Patients with diabetes and established CVD are included in this category.
[0120]      CV Risk Category 2: patients with diabetes and at least one additional risk
factor for CVD, but no established CVD.
[0121]      Stratification will be recorded in the IWR at the time of enrollment.
Approximately 70% of randomized patients will be in the CV Risk Category 1 and
                                              28

approximately 30% of randomized patients will be in the CV Risk Category 2.
Enrollment with patients of a CV risk category will be stopped when the planned
number of patients in that risk category is reached.
STUDY POPULATION
Inclusion Criteria
[0122]     Patients meeting the following criteria will be eligible to participate in the
study:
[0123]     Fasting TG levels of >200 mg/dL (2.26 mmol/L) and <500 mg/dL (5.64
mmol/L).
[0124]     LDL-C >40 mg/dL (1.04 mmol/L) and <100 mg/dL (2.60 mmol/L) and on
stable therapy with a statin (with or without ezetimibe) for at least 4 weeks prior to the
LDL-C/TG baseline qualifying measurements for randomization
[0125]      Stable therapy is defined as the same daily dose of the same statin for at
least 28 days before the lipid qualification measurements (TG and LDL-C) and, if
applicable, the same daily dose of ezetimibe for at least 28 days before the lipid
qualification measurements (TG and LDL-C). Patients who have their statin therapy or
use of ezetimibe initiated at Visit 1, or have their statin, statin dose and/or ezetimibe
dose changed at Visit 1, will need to go through a stabilization period of at least 28
days since initiation/change and have their qualifying lipid measurements measured
(TG and LDL-C) after the washout period (at Visit 1.1).
[0126]      Statins may be administered with or without ezetimibe.
[0127]     If patients qualify at the first qualification visit (Visit 1) for TG and LDL-C,
and meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, they may be randomized at Visit 2. If
patients don't qualify at the first qualifying visit (Visit 1), a second re-qualifying visit
(Visit 1.1) is allowed. For some patients, because they need to stabilize medications
and/or need to washout medications, the second re-qualifying visit (Visit 1.1) will be
needed after the stabilization/washout period.

STUDY PROCEDURES
Assessment Schedule
[0196]      Screening Period
[0197]      Screening Visit (Visit 1)
[0198]      Patients will come to the Research Site for Visit 1. They will be instructed
to fast for at least 10 hours before their visit.
                                              36

[0199]     If patients qualify for randomization based on the procedures at Visit 1, they
need to be randomized within 60 days after Visit 1. The following procedures will be
performed at the screening visit:
[0200]     Obtain signed informed consent
[0201]     Assign the patient a patient number
[0202]     Obtain medical, surgical and family history
[0203]     Record demographics
[0204]     Obtain height, weight, and body mass index
[0205]     Obtain vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate,
respiratory rate, and body temperature)
[0206]     Obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram
[0207]     Evaluate inclusion/exclusion criteria
[0208]     This includes procedures and (fasting) blood samples (for example, hs-CRP,
calculated creatinine clearance) as needed to determine the CV risk category (see
inclusion criteria)
[0209]     Obtain fasting blood samples for chemistry and hematology testing
[0210]     Obtain a fasting blood sample for the lipid profile (TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL
C, non-HDL-C, VLDL-C)
[0211]     Perform a urine pregnancy test on women of childbearing potential
[0212]     Record concomitant medication(s)
[0213]     Instruct patient to fast for at least 10 hours prior to the next visit
[0214]     Screening Visit (Visit 1.1)
                                               37

[0215]      Some patients will skip Visit 1.1: Patients who qualify for study
participation after Visit 1 because they meet all inclusion criterion and none of the
exclusion criteria, may return to the Research Site for Visit 2 to be randomized and to
start the treatment/follow-up period of the study. For these patients, Visit 2 will occur
soon after Visit 1.
[0216]      Patients, who do not qualify at Visit 1, may return to the Research Site for a
second qualifying visit (Visit 1.1) at the discretion of the investigator. At Visit 1.1,
procedures that caused failure of eligibility at Visit 1 will be repeated. Patients will be
eligible for randomization after Visit 1.1 if they meet all inclusion criteria and if they
no longer fail the exclusion criteria. If patients are evaluated at Visit 1.1 and qualify
for randomization based on the repeated procedures at Visit 1.1, they need to be
randomized within 60 days after Visit 1.
[0217]      For some patients, Visit 1.1 will be mandatory at least 28 days after Visit 1
in order to check eligibility. These are patients who at Visit 1 started treatment with a
statin, changed their statin, changed the daily dose of their statin, started to washout
prohibited medications or started a stabilization period with certain medications (see
inclusion/exclusion criteria for details). Any of these changes at Visit 1 may affect the
qualifying lipid levels and therefore, patients will need to have Visit 1.1 to determine
whether they qualify based on lipid level requirements (TG and LDL-C) determined at
Visit 1. Other procedures that caused failure of eligibility at Visit 1 will also be
repeated at Visit 1.1.
[0218]      The following procedures will be performed at the screening visit:
[0219]      Obtain vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate,
respiratory rate, and body temperature)
[0220]      Evaluate inclusion/exclusion criteria; only those evaluations will be repeated
that deemed the patient not eligible on Visit 1.
[0221]      Obtain fasting blood samples for chemistry and hematology testing. Only
those samples will be obtained that deemed the patient not eligible on Visit 1.
                                              38

[0222]      Obtain a fasting blood sample for the lipid profile (TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL
C, non-HDL-C, VLDL-C) if the patient was deemed not eligible on Visit 1. This
includes patients who at Visit 1 started treatment with a statin, changed their statin,
changed the daily dose of their statin, started to washout prohibited medications or
started a stabilization period with certain medications (see inclusion/exclusion criteria
for details). These patients will have a fasting blood sample collected at Visit 1.1 for
the qualifying lipid values (TG and LDL-C), and the TG and LDL-C inclusion criteria
will be evaluated.
[0223]      Record concomitant medication(s)
[0224]      Treatment/Follow-Up Period
[0225]      Every attempt should be made to complete the follow-up visits during the

Additional Visits
                                            42

[0290]      The end date of the study is expected for Day 1800 but the actual end date
will be dependent on the determination of the study end date by the DMC. The study
end date is determined to be when approximately 1612 primary efficacy events have
occurred. If the actual study end date is later than the expected end date, additional
visits will be planned between Visit 7 and the Last Visit with a maximum of 360 10
days between visits. If the actual study end date is sooner than the expected end date,
fewer visits will occur, and the last visit (See Section 6.1.2.5) will occur sooner.
[0291]      On additional visits the same procedures will be performed as listed in
Section 6.1.2.3. Irrespective of the number of additional visits, after the DMC has
established the end of the study date, there will be a last visit with procedures as listed
in Section 6.1.2.5.
Last Visit - End of Study
[0292]      All patients will complete the study at the same time (within a 30-day
window after the study end date), irrespective of the date that they were randomized.
The end date of the study is planned for Day 1800 but the actual end date will be
dependent on the determination of the study end date when approximately 1612
primary efficacy events have occurred (event-driven trial). For each patient, the last
visit may occur within 30 day after the actual study end date. However, for the efficacy
endpoints based on CV events, only events occurring up to and including the
scheduled actual study end date will be included in the efficacy analyses.
[0293]      A final follow-up visit is required for all patients. In the rare cases that a
final follow-up visit cannot occur within the 30-day timeframe following the study end
date, any attempt to contact the patient must be recorded on a special contact form,
until/unless appropriate information is obtained.
[0294]      At the Last Visit, the following procedures will be performed:
[0295]      Perform physical examination
[0296]      Obtain weight
                                              43

[0325]      Day 1710 5 days
[0326]      If the treatment/follow-up period of the study is extended beyond the
expected end date (Day 1800), additional follow-up phone calls will be made every 3
months in-between additional visits 5 days. If the treatment/follow period of the
study is shorter than the expected end date, less follow-up phone calls will be needed.
[0327]      Every attempt will be made to talk to each patient within this time frame.
[0328]      The following information will be collected from the patient:
[0329]      Possible efficacy endpoints related to CV events. Patients will be asked to
return to the Research Site to assess for any endpoints or events identified.

[0337]     To not take study drug on the morning of their next visit
[0338]     To fast for at least 10 hours prior to the next visit
Laboratory Procedures
[0339]      Clinical Laboratory Procedures
[0340]     All clinical laboratory determinations for screening and safety will be
performed by a certified clinical laboratory under the supervision of the Sponsor or its
designee.
[0341]     Whenever possible and appropriate, samples for the clinical laboratory
procedures will be collected after fasting for at least 10 hours. For the purposes of this
study, fasting is defined as nothing by mouth except water (and any essential
medications).
[0342]     The investigator must review and sign all laboratory test reports. At
screening, patients who have laboratory values that are outside the exclusionary limits
specified in the exclusion criteria may not be enrolled in the study (patients can be
considered for the study if values are classified as not clinically significant by the
investigator). After randomization, the investigator will be notified if laboratory values
are outside of their normal range. In this case, the investigator will be required to
conduct clinically appropriate follow-up procedures.
Safety Laboratory Tests
[0343]     The safety laboratory tests include:
                                             46

[0344]     Hematology with complete blood count (CBC), including RBC, hemoglobin
(Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), white cell blood count (WBC), white cell differential, and
platelet count
[0345]     Biochemistry panel including total protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase,
alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT), total
bilirubin, glucose, calcium, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), blood urea
nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, uric acid, creatine kinase, and HbAlc.
Fasting Lipid Profile
[0346]     The fasting lipid panel includes: TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, and
VLDL-C.
[0347]     At all visits, LDL-C will be calculated using the Friedewald equation. At
Visit 1 and Visit 1.1 Direct LDL-C will be used if at the same visit TG >400 mg/dL
(4.52 mmol/L). These LDL-C values will be used for the evaluation of the LDL-C
inclusion criterion (LDL-C qualifying measurements for randomization) and for the
assessment of changes in the statin therapy when LDL-C is not at goal. At all
remaining visits (except Visit 2 and Visit 4) LDL-C will be measured by Direct LDL
Cholesterol or by Preparative Ultracentrifugation if at the same visit TG >400 mg/dL
(4.52 mmol/L). In addition, irrespective of the TG levels, at Visit 2 (0 Months of
Follow-up, baseline) and at Visit 4 (12 Months of Follow-up), LDL-C will be
measured by Preparative Ultracentrifugation. These Preparative Ultracentrifugation
LDL-C measurements will be used in the statistical analysis including the calculation
of the percent change from baseline (1 year versus baseline).
Genetic testing
[0348]     A fasting blood sample will be stored for future genetic testing at the
discretion of the sponsor. The specifics of this test will be determined at a later date.
This sample is optional as local regulations may prohibit genetic samples to be
collected or shipped outside the country, or patients may not consent.
                                             47

[0349]      Research on genetic testing will look for links between genes and certain
diseases, including their treatment(s) such as medicines and medical care. The blood
samples will be collected in the study center with the regular protocol-required labs.
Each patient tube with sample for genetic testing will be labeled with patient number
only. The site will maintain a Subject Code Identification List for cross-reference.
The patient number does not contain any identifiable information (i.e. Patient initials,
date of birth, etc). Un-analyzed samples will be stored frozen by the sponsor for a
period of up to 2 years following the end of the study, at which time they will be
destroyed. If samples are tested, results will not be reported to the patient, parents,
relatives, or attending physician and will not be recorded in the patient's medical
records. There will be no follow-up contact with the sites or patients regarding this
sample. The subject can withdraw their consent for genetic testing at any time up to
analysis, even after the sample has been obtained. The subject can notify the site in
writing that they withdraw their consent for the genetic testing portion of the study,
and it will be documented by the site in the subject chart, as well as captured in the
CRF. The lab will be notified to pull the sample and destroy it.
Biomarkers Assays
[0350]      The biomarker assays include: hs-CRP, Apo B and hsTnT.
[0351]      Additional laboratory tests
[0352]      Additional laboratory tests include:
[0353]      A urine pregnancy test will be administered to women of childbearing
potential at certain visits as listed in schedule of procedures (Table 1). The urine
pregnancy tests will be performed at the Research Site utilizing marketed test kits, or
at a certified clinical laboratory.
[0354]      A fasting blood sample (12 mL) for archiving. This sample will be collected
only at sites in countries where allowed by local regulations and at sites for which
approved by the IRB or IEC. The plasma from the archiving sample will be stored
frozen in 2 separate equal aliquots, and will be used at the Sponsor's discretion to
                                              48

perform repeat analyses described in the protocol or to perform other tests related to
cardiovascular health.
[0355]     Blinding of Laboratory Results
[0356]     All efficacy laboratory results during the double-blind period of the trial will
be blinded (values not provided) to patients, investigators, pharmacists and other
supporting staff at the Research Sites, personnel and designees of the Sponsor, study
administrators and personnel at the organization(s) and vendors managing and/or
supporting the study, with the exception of the laboratory personnel conducting the
assays. To ensure patient safety, hsTnT values will be reported to the site.
[0357]     Flagging of Critical Lab Values
[0358]      Critical lab values are values that may warrant medical intervention to avoid
possible harm to a patient. Critical lab values will be defined in the Laboratory Manual
for the study, and the Research Site will be notified of the occurrence of a critical lab
value (critical high or critical low) by a special annotation (flag) in the laboratory
reports provided to the Research Sites. Although laboratory values that are part of the
efficacy endpoints during the double-blind period of the study will not be provided to
the Research Site (see Section 6.3.1.6), the sites will be notified when the TG value of
a patient sample is >1000 mg/dL (11.29 mmol/L) (critical high TG value) or if the
LDL-C values of a patient sample is >130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) (critical high LDL-C
value). These critical high values will need to be confirmed by a repeat measurement
(new fasting blood sample) within 7 days. TG value of >2000 mg/dL (22.58 mmol/L)
will also be flagged, so that appropriate medical action can be taken by the investigator
as soon as possible.
[0359]     If TG values are confirmed critically high, patients may be discontinued
from study drug with the option to remain on study. The investigator should use the
best clinical judgment for each patient which could include the use of approved TG
lowering medications after patients have been discontinued from study drug.
[0360]     If LDL-C values are confirmed critically high, the investigator may need to
take appropriate medical action which could include: reinforce/intensify therapeutic
                                              49

lifestyle changes (including diet and physical activity), increase the dose of the present
statin therapy, add ezetimibe, or prescribe a more potent statin to lower LDL-C. The
investigator should use the best clinical judgment for each patient.
[0361]      Medical Procedures
[0362]      Medical, Surgical and Family History
[0363]      Medical history, including family history and details regarding all illnesses
and allergies, date(s) of onset, status of current condition, and smoking and alcohol use
will be collected on all patients.
[0364]      Demographics
[0365]      Demographic information including day, month, and year of birth, race, and
gender will be collected for all patients.
[0366]      Vital Signs
[0367]      Vital signs include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate,
respiratory rate, and body temperature. Blood pressure will be measured using a
standardized process:
[0368]      Patient should sit for >5 minutes with feet flat on the floor and measurement
arm supported so that the midpoint of the manometer cuff is at heart level.
[0369]      Use a mercury sphygmomanometer or automatic blood pressure device with
an appropriately sized cuff with the bladder centered over the brachial artery.
[0370]      Blood pressure should be recorded to the nearest 2 mmHg mark on the
manometer or to the nearest whole number on an automatic device. A blood pressure
reading should be repeated 1 to 2 minutes later, and the second reading should also be
recorded to the nearest 2 mmHg mark.
[0371]      Physical Examination
                                              50

[0372]       A physical examination must include source documentation of general
appearance, skin, and specific head and neck, heart, lung, abdomen, extremities, and
neuromuscular assessments.
[0373]       Height, Weight and Body Mass Index
[0374]       Height and weight will be measured. Measurement of weight should be
performed with the patient dressed in indoor clothing, with shoes removed, and
bladder empty.
[0375]       Waist Circumference
[0376]       Waist circumference will be measured with a tape measure, as follows: Start
at the top of the hip bone then bring the tape measure all the way around - level with
the navel. Make sure the tape measure is snug, but without compressing the skin, and
that it is parallel with the floor.
[0377]       Patients should not hold their breath while measuring waist circumference.
[0378]       Electrocardiogram (ECG)
[0379]       ECGs (standard 12-lead) will be obtained annually. Site personnel should
make every attempt to perform a patient's ECG using the same equipment at each
visit. ECGs will be reviewed by the site for the detection of silent MI. Silent MIs will
be sent for event adjudication.
TREATMENT AND RESTRICTIONS
[0380]       Treatment
[0381]       Treatment Regimen, Dosage, and Duration
[0382]       Eligible study patients will be randomly assigned on Day 0 to one of the 2
treatment groups. Patients in each group will receive either 4 g/day AMR101 or
placebo for up to 4.75 years (4 years planned median treatment duration) according to
Table 2.
                                               51

[0383]        The daily dose of study drug is 4 capsules per day taken as two capsules
take on two occasions per day (2 capsules given twice daily).
Table 2.                      Dosing Schedule during the Treatment Period
Treatment          Daily Dose         Number of Capsules per Day
Group______                            _______________                              __
1                  4g                 4 capsules of 1000 mg AMR101
2    _Placebo                         4 capsules of matching placebo
[0384]        Patients will be instructed to take study drug with food (i.e., with or at the
end of their morning and evening meals). On days that patients are scheduled for study
visits, the daily dose of study drug will be administered by site personnel with food
provided by the site following collection of all fasting blood samples. For the purposes
of this study, fasting is defined as nothing by mouth except water (and any essential
medications) for at least 10 hours.
Treatment Assignment
[0385]        Identification number
[0386]        A unique patient identification number (patient number) will be established
for each patient at each site. The patient number will be used to identify the patient
throughout the study and will be entered on all documentation. If a patient is not
eligible to receive treatment, or if a patient discontinues from the study, the patient
number cannot be reassigned to another patient. The patient number will be used to
assign patients to one of the 2 treatment groups according to the randomization
schedule.
[0387]        Drug Randomization
[0388]        Only qualified patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the
exclusion criteria will be randomized and will receive study medication starting at
Visit 2 (Day 0). Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 treatment
groups. Randomization will be stratified by CV risk category, use of ezetimibe and by
geographical region (Westernized, Eastern European, and Asia Pacific countries) (See
                                                52

Section 3.10). Approximately 70% of randomized patients will be in the CV Risk
Category 1, including patients with established CVD, and approximately 30% of
randomized patients will be in the CV Risk Category 2, including patients with
diabetes and at least one additional risk factor but no established CVD. Enrollment
with patients of a CV risk category will be stopped when the planned number of
patients in that risk category is reached.
[0389]      Emergency Unblinding
[0390]      In an emergency, when knowledge of the patient's treatment assignment is
essential for the clinical management or welfare of the patient, the investigator may
request the patient's treatment assignment for unblinding. Prior to unblinding the
patient's individual treatment assignment, the investigator should assess the
relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug (Yes or No). If
the blind is broken for any reason, the investigator must record the date and reason for
breaking the blind on the appropriate Case Report Form (CRF) and source documents.
[0391]      Compliance Control
[0392]      It is recommended that, unless clear contraindications arise, patients be
strongly encouraged to adhere to their treatment regimen with the study drug for the
duration of the trial. Any interruptions of therapy should, if possible, be brief (e.g., <4
weeks) and only for clinically indicated reasons, such as adverse events.
Discontinuations will be discouraged as much as possible. Any discontinuations
should be based on compelling clinical reasons.
[0393]      For every patient, an assessment of compliance to the study drug treatment
regimen must be obtained at each scheduled visit. Study medication will be dispensed
in amounts exceeding the amount required for the study. Patients will be instructed to
return all unused study medication at the next visit. Compliance to the study drug
regimen will be evaluated at each visit by counting unused capsules. Discrepancies
will be evaluated and discussed with each patient to assess compliance. If compliance
is unsatisfactory, the patient will be counseled about the importance of compliance to
the dosing regimen. At the end of the study, the final study medication compliance will
be determined by unused capsule count.
                                             53

[0394]       Study Restrictions
[0395]       Concomitant Medications during Treatment/Follow-Up Period
[0396]      Any medications administered during the study period must be documented
on the Concomitant Medication CRF. Patients must not have taken any investigational
agent within 90 days prior to screening. Patients cannot participate in any other
investigational medication trial while participating in this study.
[0397]      The following non-study drug related, non-statin, lipid-altering medications
and supplements, and foods are prohibited during the study (from Visit 1 until after the
Last Visit-End of Study), except for compelling medical reasons in ODIS patients:
[0398]      niacin >200 mg/day;
[0399]       fibrates;
[0400]      prescription omega-3 fatty acid medications;
[0401]       dietary supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., flaxseed, fish,
krill, or algal oils);
[0402]      bile acid sequestrants;
[0403]      cyclophosphamide;
[0404]       systemic retinoids
[0405]      If any of these products would be used during the treatment/follow-up
period of the study, it should be for compelling medical reasons in ODIS patients, and
it should be documented in the Concomitant Medication CRF. If the ODIS patient
agrees to restart study medication, the use of excluded medication must be
discontinued.
[0406]      Foods enriched with omega-3 fatty acids are strongly discouraged after Visit
1 for the duration of the study (does not apply to The Netherlands or Canada only.
Therefore, all centers in The Netherlands and Canada must ignore this request).
                                            54

[0407]      The following products are allowed: statins, ezetimibe, and herbal products
& dietary supplements not containing omega-3 fatty acids.
[0408]       Statins:
[0409]      The same statin at the same dose should be continued until the end of the
study, unless deemed medically necessary to change because of an adverse event or
lack of efficacy (LOE). It is preferred that if LOE is the determining factor that
ezetimibe be added to the present dose.
[0410]       Switching between a brand name statin and the generic version of the same
statin is allowed at any time during the study.
[0411]        Statins may be administered with or without ezetimibe.
[0412]      Based on the FDA recommendation, simvastatin 80 mg be used only in
patients who have been taking this dose for 12 months or more and have not
experienced any muscle toxicity. (See reference: FDA Drug Safety Communication:
Ongoing safety review of high-dose Zocor (simvastatin) and increased risk of muscle
injury.
(http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetylnformationforPatientsa
ndProviders/ucm204882.htm)
[0413]       Changing of the type of statin or the statin dose during the treatment/follow
up period of the study should only be done for compelling medical reasons and must
be documented in the CRF.
[0414]      LDL-C Rescue:
[0415]      If the level of LDL-C exceeds 130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) during the study
(initial measurement and confirmed by a second determination at least 1 week later),
the investigator may either increase the dose of the present statin therapy or may add
ezetimibe to lower LDL-C. The investigator should use the best clinical judgment for
each patient.
                                             55

[0416]      No data are available with regard to potential interactions between ethyl
EPA and oral contraceptives. There are no reports suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids,
including ethyl-EPA, would decrease the efficacy of oral contraceptives.
[0417]      Patient Restrictions
[0418]      Beginning at the screening visit, all patients should be instructed to refrain
from excessive alcohol consumption, to follow a physician recommended diet and to
maintain it through the duration of the study. Excessive alcohol consumption is on
average 2 units of alcohol per day or drinking 5 units or more for men or 4 units or
more for women in any one hour (episodic excessive drinking or binge drinking). A
unit of alcohol is defined as a 12-ounce (350 mL) beer, 5-ounce (150 mL) wine, or 1.5
ounce (45 mL) of 80-proof alcohol for drinks.
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT
[0419]      Clinical Trial Material
[0420]      The following will be supplied by the Sponsor:
[0421]      AMR101 1000 mg capsules
[0422]      Placebo capsules
[0423]      The Sponsor will supply sufficient quantities of AMR101 1000 mg capsules
and placebo capsules to allow for completion of the study. The lot numbers of the
drugs supplied will be recorded in the final study report.
[0424]      Records will be maintained indicating the receipt and dispensation of all
drug supplies. At the conclusion of the study, any unused study drug will be destroyed.
[0425]      Pharmaceutical Formulations
[0426]      AMR101 1000 mg and placebo capsules (paraffin) are provided in liquid
filled, oblong, gelatin capsules. Each capsule is filled with a clear liquid (colorless to
pale yellow in color). The capsules are approximately 25.5 mm in length with a
diameter of approximately 9.5 mm.
                                             56

[0427]     Labeling and Packaging
[0428]     Study medication will be packaged in high-density polyethylene bottles.
Labeling and packaging will be performed according to GMP guidelines and all
applicable country-specific requirements. The bottles will be numbered for each
patient based on the randomization schedule. The patient randomization number
assigned by IWR or a designee of the Sponsor for the study (if no IWR system is
used), will correspond to the number on the bottles. The bottle number for each patient
will be recorded in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system for the study.
[0429]     Dispensing Procedures and Storage Conditions
[0430]     Dispensing Procedures
[0431]     At Visit 2 (Day 0), patients will be assigned study drug according to their
treatment group determined by the randomization schedule. Once assigned to a
treatment group, patients will receive study drug supplies. At each visit, patients will
bring unused drug supplies dispensed to them earlier. From the drug supplies assigned
to each patient, site personnel will administer drug while the patients are at the
Research Site.
[0432]     The investigator or designee must contact the IWR system or a designee of
the Sponsor for the study (if no IWR system is used) when any unscheduled
replacements of study medication are needed.
[0433]     During the last visit during the treatment period, patients will bring the
unused drug supplies for site personnel to calculate the final study medication
compliance by unused capsule count.
[0434]     Storage Conditions
[0435]     At the Research Sites, study drugs must be stored at room temperature, 68'F
to 77'F (20'C to 25'C). Do not allow storage temperature to go below 59'F (15'C) or
above 86'F (30'C). Store in the original package.
                                             57

[0436]      Study drugs must be stored in a pharmacy or locked and secure storage
facility, accessible only to those individuals authorized by the investigator to dispense
the drug. The investigator or designee will keep accurate dispensing records. At the
conclusion of the study, study site personnel will account for all used and unused study
drug. Any unused study drug will be destroyed. The investigator agrees not to
distribute study drug to any patient, except those patients participating in the study.
EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS
[0437]      Specification of Variables and Procedures
[0438]      The primary endpoint and the majority of the secondary and tertiary
endpoints are based on clinical events related to CVD and mortality. All events
occurring between randomization and the study end date (inclusive) must be recorded.
Only adjudicated events will be included in the final analyses. Further details on the
assessment of clinical events and their definitions will be found in the CEC charter.
[0439]      Efficacy Endpoints
[0440]      Primary Efficacy Endpoint
[0441]      Time from randomization to the first occurrence of the composite of the
following clinical events:

revascularization, unstable angina determined to be caused by myocardial ischemia by
invasive/non-invasive testing and requiring emergent hospitalization, nonfatal stroke,
or peripheral CVD requiring intervention, angioplasty, bypass surgery, or aneurysm
repair.
[0451]     Other secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows (to be tested in said
order):
[0452]     The composite of total mortality, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke;

[0461]     For the secondary endpoints that count a single event, the first occurrence of
this type of event will be counted in each patient. For secondary endpoints that are
composites of two or more types of events, the first occurrence of any of the event
types included in the composite will be counted in each patient.
[0462]     Tertiary Efficacy Endpoints:
[0463]     The second, third, fourth, and fifth major CV event of the primary
composite endpoint. The type of (nonfatal) events may occur in any order.

[0474]     For the tertiary endpoints that count a single event, the first occurrence of
this type of event will be counted in each patient. For tertiary endpoints that are
composites of two or more types of events, the first occurrence of any of the event
                                            60

types included in the composite will be counted in each patient (except when stated
otherwise, for the second, third, fourth, and fifth major CV event).
SAFETY ASSESSMENTS
[0475]      Specification of Variables and Procedures
[0476]      Safety assessments will include adverse events, clinical laboratory
measurements (chemistry, hematology), 12-lead ECGs, vital signs (systolic and
diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature), and
physical examinations as per Study Procedures/Table 1.
[0477]      A complete medical, surgical and family history will be completed at Visit
1.
[0478]      All laboratory test results must be evaluated by the investigator as to their
clinical significance. Any observations at physical examinations or laboratory values
considered by the investigator to be clinically significant should be considered an
adverse event.
[0479]      Adverse Events
[0480]      An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, which
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medication under
investigation. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally
associated with the use of an investigational medication product, whether or not related
to the investigational medication product. All adverse events, including observed or
volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate
CRF. Each adverse event is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, and causal
relationship with the study medication or other factors.
[0481]      Adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be
monitored from the time of informed consent until study participation is complete.
Patients should be instructed to report any adverse event that they experience to the
                                              61

investigator. Beginning with Visit 2, investigators should assess for adverse events at
each visit and record the event on the appropriate adverse event CRF.
[0482]     Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual
associated signs and symptoms should be identified by the investigator and recorded
on the CRF. However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a
component of a specific disease or syndrome by the investigator, it should be recorded
as a separate adverse event on the CRF.
[0483]     Any medical condition that is present when a patient is screened or present
at baseline that does not deteriorate should not be reported as an adverse event.
However, medical conditions or signs or symptoms present at baseline and that change
in severity or seriousness at any time during the study should be reported as an adverse
event.
[0484]      Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal
assessments that are detected during the study or are present at baseline and
significantly worsen will be reported as adverse events or SAEs. The investigator will
exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal
laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.
[0485]     The investigator will rate the severity (intensity) of each adverse event as
mild, moderate, or severe, and will also categorize each adverse event as to its
potential relationship to study drug using the categories of Yes or No.
[0486]      Severity:
[0487]     Mild - An event that is usually transient in nature and generally not
interfering with normal activities.
[0488]     Moderate - An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with
normal activities.
[0489]      Severe - An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or do usual
activity or inability to work or perform normal daily activity.
                                             62

[0490]      Causality Assessment:
[0491]      The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug
is to be assessed according to the following definitions:
[0492]      No (unrelated, not related, no relation) - The time course between the
administration of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event
rules out a causal relationship and another cause (concomitant drugs, therapies,
complications, etc.) is suspected.
[0493]      Yes - The time course between the administration of study drug and the
occurrence or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship
and no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc.) can be
identified.
[0494]      The following factors should also be considered:
[0495]      The temporal sequence from study medication administration
[0496]      The event should occur after the study medication is given. The length of
time from study medication exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical
context of the event.
[0497]      Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases
[0498]      Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and
course of the disease being treated and any other disease the patient may have.
[0499]      Concomitant medication
[0500]      The other medications the patient is taking or the treatment the patient
receives should be examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to
cause the event in question.
[0501]      Known response pattern for this class of study medication
[0502]      Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is
likely to be a class effect.
                                             63

[0503]      Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses
[0504]      The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the patient and
provide a logical and better explanation for the event.
[0505]      The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study medication
[0506]      The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism,
and excretion) of the study medication should be considered.
[0507]      Unexpected Adverse Events - An unexpected adverse event is an adverse
event either not previously reported or where the nature, seriousness, severity, or
outcome is not consistent with the current Investigator's Brochure.
[0508]      Serious Adverse Events
[0509]      A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that meets any
of the following criteria:
[0510]      Results in death
[0511]      Is life-threatening- Note: The term "life-threatening" in the definition of
"serious" refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the
event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it
were more severe.
[0512]      Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization- Note: In
general, hospitalization for treatment of a pre-existing condition(s) that did not worsen
from baseline is not considered adverse events and should not be reported as SAEs.
[0513]      Results in disability/incapacity
[0514]      Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
[0515]      Is an important medical event- Note: Important medical events that may not
result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an
SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed
                                              64

above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions
that do not result in inpatient hospitalizations, or the development of drug dependency.
[0516]     By design of this study SAEs that are endpoint events will only be recorded
for the endpoint determination and not captured as SAEs. The intention is that the
endpoint events are not reported to IRBs as SAEs, unless the IRB requires that these
are reported. Investigators should specifically inform their institution/IRB of this plan
and confirm whether or not they want the endpoint events reported. By agreement with
the US FDA, these endpoints will also not be reported to the US FDA as SAEs; rather
they will be reported as endpoint events. Following adjudication if the event is
determined to not meet the criteria for an event, the event will be evaluated as an SAE
beginning with that day as Day 0.
[0517]      Serious Adverse Event Reporting - Procedure for Investigators
[0518]     Initial Reports
[0519]     All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent until 28 days
following the last administration of study medication must be reported to the Sponsor
or designee within 24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any
adverse event that meets any of the aforementioned serious criteria). SAEs that the
investigator considers related to study medication occurring after the 28-day follow-up
period will also be reported to the Sponsor or designee.
[0520]     The investigator is required to submit SAE reports to the Institutional
Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) in accordance with local
requirements. All investigators involved in studies using the same investigational
medicinal product (IMP) will receive any Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse
Reaction (SUSAR) reports for onward submission to their local IRB as required. All
reports sent to investigators will be blinded.
[0521]     In addition, regulatory agencies will be notified of SAEs per the
requirements of the specific regulatory jurisdiction regulations and laws.
                                              65

[0522]      Follow-Up Reports
[0523]      The investigator must continue to follow the patient until the SAE has
subsided, or until the condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of
persistent impairment), or the patient dies. Within 24 hours of receipt of follow-up
information, the investigator must update the SAE form electronically in the EDC
system for the study and submit any supporting documentation (e.g., laboratory test
reports, patient discharge summary, or autopsy reports) to the Sponsor or designee via
fax or email.
[0524]      Reporting by the Sponsor
[0525]      IRBs and IECs will be informed of SUSARs according to local
requirements. Cases will be unblinded for reporting purposes as required.
[0526]      Exposure In Utero During Clinical Trials
[0527]      If a patient becomes pregnant during the study, the investigator should
report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of being notified. The
Sponsor or designee will then forward the Exposure In Utero form to the investigator
for completion.
[0528]      The patient should be followed by the investigator until completion of the
pregnancy. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the
investigator should notify the Sponsor or designee. At the completion of the
pregnancy, the investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the
outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE
(i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or
congenital anomaly), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an
SAE.
TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION/PATIENT WITHDRAWAL
[0529]      Patients may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. Study
drug administration may also be discontinued at any time, at the discretion of the
investigator. In any case, follow-up for efficacy and safety should be continued.
                                             66

[0530]      Reasons for Early Study Drug Discontinuation
[0531]      Study drug discontinuation should be avoided as much as possible, but may
be done for any of the following reasons:
[0532]      Patient withdraws consent or requests early discontinuation from the study
for any reason. Patients should be encouraged to continue to participate in the study for
the entire duration of the study even if they choose not to take study medication any
longer.
[0533]      Occurrence of a clinical or laboratory adverse event, either serious or non
serious, at the discretion of the investigator. The Sponsor or designee should be
notified if a patient is discontinued because of an adverse event or laboratory
abnormality. It is recommended that, unless clear contraindications arise, patients be
strongly encouraged to adhere to their treatment regimen with the study drug for the
duration of the trial. Any interruptions of therapy should, if possible, be brief (e.g., <4
weeks) and only for clinically indicated reasons, such as adverse events. The following
should be considered reason for discontinuation:
[0534]      ALT > 3x ULN and bilirubin > 1.5x ULN
[0535]      ALT >5x ULN
[0536]      ALT >3x ULN and appearance or worsening of hepatitis
[0537]      ALT > 3x ULN persisting for >4weeks
[0538]      ALT > 3x ULN and cannot be monitored weekly for 4 weeks
[0539]      Any medical condition or personal circumstance that, in the opinion of the
investigator, exposes the patient to risk by continuing in the study or precludes
adherence to the protocol.
[0540]      Sponsor discontinues the study.
[0541]      A TG value that is flagged as critically high, i.e., >1000 mg/dL (11.29
mmol/L), and confirmed as critically high by a repeat measurement (new fasting blood
                                             67

sample) within 7 days. In this case, a patient may be discontinued from study drug
(with the option to remain ODIS) and other lipid-altering medications may be
(re)initiated. If the TG value is flagged as >2000 mg/dL (22.58 mmol/L) then
appropriate medical action can be taken by the investigator as soon as possible.
[0542]      Occurrence of an outcome event according to the judgment of the
investigator is not considered a valid reason for study drug discontinuation.
[0543]      Patients whose treatment with study medication is discontinued early, and
have not withdrawn consent, will stay in study and will be monitored until the end of
the study. Patients that continue in the study after indefinite cessation of therapy will
be characterized as Off Drug In Study (ODIS). ODIS patients should be asked to
return to the study site for an interim visit once the patient has been off study drug for
>30 days. Procedures at this visit are consistent with those at Visit 5. If not
contraindicated, patients will also have the option to restart study medication at any
point once characterized as ODIS.
[0544]      The reason for study drug discontinuation or interruption will be recorded
on the CRF.
[0545]      Follow-Up after Early Study Drug Discontinuation/Lost to Follow-Up
[0546]      Patients who prematurely discontinue study drug are not to be replaced.
[0547]      All randomized patients must be followed up according to the study
flowchart until the study end date or death, regardless of whether they discontinue
study drug prematurely or not. Any event occurring after early study drug
discontinuation will be recorded up through the study end date.
[0548]      In order to follow the medical status of the patients, especially when they
discontinued the study, investigators are encouraged to obtain information from the
patient's primary care practitioner (physician or any other medical care provider).
Investigators are also requested to try as much as possible to re-contact those patients
at the end of the trial to obtain at least their vital status as well as their status with
                                               68

respect to the primary endpoint, and thus avoid lost to follow-up for the efficacy
assessment.
[0549]     If patients are lost to follow-up, the CRF must be completed up to the last
visit or contact.
STATISTICS
[0550]     Analysis Populations
[0551]     Randomized Population
[0552]     The randomized population will include all patients who sign the informed
consent form and are assigned a randomization number at Visit 2 (Day 0).
[0553]     Intent-to-Treat Population
[0554]     The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population will consist of all randomized patients
who take at least one dose of study drug. The ITT population is the primary analysis
population. All efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population.
[0555]     Per-Protocol Population
[0556]     The per-protocol (PP) population will include all ITT patients without any
major protocol deviations, and who had >80% compliance with study drug while on
treatment (up to discontinuation for patients whose treatment is terminated early). The
per-protocol efficacy analysis for CV events will be restricted to each patient's time on
study drug plus 30 days thereafter.
[0557]      Safety Population
[0558]     All safety analyses will be conducted based on the safety population, which
is defined as all randomized patients who receive at least one dose of study drug. This
is the same as the ITT population.
[0559]      Statistical Methods
                                              69

[0560]      Safety and efficacy variables will be analyzed using appropriate statistical
methods to be described in detail in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The
SAP will be finalized before study unblinding.
[0561]     Patient Disposition and Demographic/Baseline Characteristics
[0562]     The numbers of patients screened, the number of patients randomized per
treatment group (randomized population), and the number of patients in the ITT and
PP populations by treatment group will be listed.
[0563]     For randomized patients who discontinued treatment with study drug, the
primary reason for discontinuation will be listed and summarized by treatment group.
[0564]      Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and
maximum) will be provided by treatment group for demographic characteristics (e.g.,
age, sex, race, and ethnicity) and baseline characteristics (e.g., body weight, height,
and body mass index) in the ITT and PP populations.
[0565]     Demographic data and baseline characteristics will be compared among
treatment groups for the ITT and PP population. Differences in demographic and
baseline characteristics will be tested using a chi-square test (for categorical variables)
or a 1-way analysis of variance model with treatment as a factor (for continuous
variables). The p-values will be used as descriptive statistics, primarily as an
assessment of the adequacy of randomization.
[0566]      Study Medication Exposure and Compliance
[0567]     The final compliance to study drug will be calculated as the percent of doses
taken relative to doses scheduled to be taken. Overall percent compliance will be
calculated per patient in the ITT and PP populations and summarized by treatment
group using summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and
maximum).
[0568]      Concomitant Therapies
                                             70

[0569]       Concomitant medication/therapy verbatim terms will be coded using the
latest version of the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary. The numbers and
percentages of patients in each treatment group taking concomitant medications will be
summarized by anatomic and therapeutic chemical classification and preferred term.
[0570]      Analysis of Efficacy
[0571]      For efficacy endpoints including CV events, only adjudicated events will be
included in the final statistical analyses.
[0572]       Summary Statistics
[0573]       Summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and
maximum) for the baseline and post-baseline measurements, the percent changes, or
changes from baseline will be presented by treatment group and by visit for all
efficacy variables to be analyzed. The summary statistics will include changes in body
weight and body mass index from baseline by treatment group and by visit.
[0574]      Primary Endpoint
[0575]      The primary efficacy endpoint is the time from randomization to the first
occurrence of any component of the composite of the following clinical events:
[0576]       CV death,
[0577]      Nonfatal MI (including silent MI),
[0578]      Nonfatal stroke,
[0579]       Coronary revascularization,
[0580]      Hospitalization for unstable angina determined to be caused by myocardial
ischemia by invasive/non-invasive testing.
[0581]      The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed using the
log-rank test comparing the 2 treatment groups (AMR101 and placebo) and including
the stratification factor "CV risk category", use of ezetimibe and geographical region
(Westernized, Eastern European, and Asia Pacific countries) (each as recorded in the
                                             71

IWR at the time of enrollment) as covariates. Treatment difference will be tested at
alpha level of 0.0476 accounting for one interim efficacy analysis. The hazard ratio for
treatment group (AMR101 vs. placebo) from a Cox proportional hazard model that
includes the stratification factor will also be reported, along with the associated 95%
confidence interval. Kaplan-Meier estimates from randomization to the time to the
primary efficacy endpoint will be plotted.
[0582]     The size and direction of the treatment effects of the individual components
of the composite endpoint and their relative contribution to the composite endpoint
will be determined as well.
[0583]      Secondary Endpoints
[0584]     The statistical analyses of the secondary endpoints will be analyzed by the
same log-rank test specified above for the primary efficacy endpoint. Treatment
differences will be tested at alpha level of 0.05 using a sequential procedure for
controlling type 1 error starting with the key secondary variable. The remaining
secondary variables will be tested in the order specified in Section 9.2.2. Estimates of
the hazard ratios from the Cox proportional hazard model and the associated 95%
confidence intervals will also be provided. Kaplan-Meier estimates from
randomization the time to the secondary efficacy endpoints will be plotted.
[0585]     Tertiary Endpoints
[0586]     For event rates, the statistical analyses of the tertiary endpoints will be
similar to the analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints. All tertiary analyses will be
conducted for the ITT population. No adjustments for multiple testing will be made.
[0587]     For measurements of lipids, lipoproteins and inflammatory markers the
change from baseline will be analyzed in the units of each marker, and the percent
change from baseline. Since these biomarkers are typically not normally distributed,
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used for treatment comparisons of the percent
change from baseline, and medians and quartiles will be provided for each treatment
group. The medians of the differences between the treatment groups and 95%
confidence intervals will be estimated with the Hodges-Lehmann method.
                                              72

[0588]      New onset diabetes is defined as Type 2 diabetes newly diagnosed during
the treatment/follow-up period (i.e. patients with no history of diabetes at
randomization).
[0589]      For purposes of this study, a diagnosis of diabetes is made based on the
observation of:
[0590]       1. HbAic >6.5%. The test should be performed in a laboratory using a
method that is National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) certified
and standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) assay. In
the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, HbAic >6.5% should be confirmed by
repeat testing.
OR
[0591]      2. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) >126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is
defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hr. In the absence of unequivocal
hyperglycemia, FPG >126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) should be confirmed by repeat testing.
OR
[0592]      3. 2-hr plasma glucose >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an Oral Glucose
Tolerance Test (OGTT). The test should be performed as described by the World
Health Organization, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous
glucose dissolved in water. In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, 2-hr plasma
glucose >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)
should be confirmed by repeat testing.
OR
[0593]      4. In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic
crisis, a random plasma glucose >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L).
[0594]      Exploratory Subgroup Analyses
                                             73

[0595]      Subgroup analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints (as defined
in the Statistical Analysis Plan) will be performed. All subgroup analyses will be
conducted for the ITT population. No adjustments for multiple testing will be made.
[0596]     Log-rank tests, treatment effects and the associated 95% confidence
intervals for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints within each subgroup
will be provided using the Cox proportional hazard model with treatment (AMR101 or
placebo), and stratification as a factor (with the exception of the subgroup analyses of
those subgroup variables related to the stratification factors, i.e., CV risk category that
will not have stratification as a factor).
[0597]      Subgroups including, but not limited to the following, will be explored. A
complete list will be prospectively defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan.
[0598]     Demographics:
[0599]      Gender,
[0600]      age (<65 yr and >65 yr),
[0601]     race (white and nonwhite, or any other subset with at least 10% of the total
number of patients),
[0602]      geography (western vs. non-western)
[0603]     Disease Parameters:
[0604]      CV risk category,
[0605]     the presence/absence of diabetes at baseline,
[0606]     renal impairment
[0607]     Treatment Parameters:
[0608]     by statin intensity (statin type and regimen),
[0609]     relevant concomitant medications,
                                              74

[0610]     Baseline Lipid and Lipoprotein Parameters:
[0611]     LDL-C (by tertile),
[0612]     HDL-C (by tertile),
[0613]     TG (by tertile),
[0614]     TG >150 mg/dL,
[0615]     TG >200 mg/dL and TG <200 mg/dL, combined highest tertile for TG and
lowest tertile for HDL-C,
[0616]     hs-CRP (<3 mg/L and >3 mg/L),
[0617]     Apo B (by tertile),
[0618]     non-HDL-C (by tertile)
[0619]     The consistency of the treatment effects in subgroups will be assessed for
the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. For each subgroup variable, a Cox
proportional hazard model with terms for treatment, stratification factors (with the
exception of those subgroup variables related to the stratification factors, i.e., CV risk
category), subgroup, and treatment-by-subgroup interaction will be performed. The
main treatment effect will not be tested with this model. P-values for testing the
interaction terms will be provided.
[0620]     Interim Efficacy Analysis
[0621]     One interim analysis will be performed for the primary efficacy endpoint
using best available data (adjudicated events and site reported endpoints) based on data
when approximately 60% of the total number of primary endpoint events is reached.
The interim analysis will be based on a group sequential design that includes early
stopping rules for benefit while preserving the overall Type I error rate (O'Brien
Fleming). This allows for interim analysis and preserves the overall Type I error
probability of oa=0.05 for the primary endpoint.
                                            75

[0622]      Approximately 1612 primary efficacy endpoint events are planned to be
observed during the trial, based on sample size calculation assumptions. Therefore, the
interim analysis will occur after at least 967 primary efficacy endpoint events have
been observed. According to this boundary, the critical p-value at the interim analysis
has to be p< 0.0076, resulting in the final evaluation p-value of 0.0476.
[0623]      The interim results of the study will be monitored by an independent DMC.
The analyses will be performed by the independent statistical group unblinded to the
treatment assignment. The results will be reported only to the DMC. The unblinded
information will not be released to sponsor under any circumstance before the
completion of the study. Specific statistical guidelines for data monitoring will be
discussed and formalized in a separate Interim Statistical Analysis Plan and DMC
Charter.
[0624]      Analysis of Safety
[0625]      All analyses of safety will be conducted on the safety population, which is
defined as all randomized patients who receive at least one dose of study drug. The
safety assessment will be based on the frequency of adverse events, physical exams,
vital signs and safety laboratory tests.
[0626]      Adverse events with new onset during the study between the initiation of
study drug and 30 days after the last dose of study drug for each patient will be
considered treatment-emergent (TEAEs). This will include any AE with onset prior to
initiation of study drug and increased severity after the treatment initiation.
[0627]      Treatment-emergent adverse events will be summarized by system organ
class and preferred term, and by treatment. This will include overall incidence rates
(regardless of severity and relationship to study drug), and incidence rates for
moderate or severe adverse events. A summary of SAEs and adverse events leading to
early discontinuation from the study will be presented through data listings.
[0628]      Safety laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized by post-treatment
change from baseline for each of the parameters using descriptive statistics by
treatment group. Those patients with significant laboratory abnormalities will be
                                              76

identified in data listings. Additional safety parameters will be summarized in data
listings.
[0629]     Sample Size Determination
[0630]     Sample size estimation is based on the assumption that the primary
composite endpoint (time from randomization to the first occurrence of CV death, non
fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina requiring
hospitalization) would be relatively reduced by 15%, from an event rate by 4 years of
23.6% in the placebo group to 20.5% in the AMR1O1 group. It is expected that a
minimum of 1612 primary efficacy endpoint events will be required during the study.
A total of approximately 6990 patients are needed to be able to detect this difference at
4.76% significance level (because of the interim analysis described in Section
12.2.4.6) and with 90% power, assuming an 18-month enrollment period and a median
follow-up of 4 years. The current sample size calculation is based on an estimated
placebo yearly event rate of 5.9% (23.6% over 4 years). To protect against the
possibility that the actual placebo event rate is lower than estimated, an extra 1000
patients will be enrolled (approximately 7990 patients in total). By adding the extra
1000 patients, the event rate in the placebo group could be 5.2% per year (20.8% over
4 years) without having to modify the other sample size assumptions.
[0631]     Since this is an events-driven trial, the 'sample size' is the number of events
rather than the number of patients. The number of events that occur depends primarily
on three factors: how many patients are enrolled, the combined group event rate, and
how long the patients are followed. Because of the difficulty in predicting the
combined event rate, the sponsor will monitor that event rate as the trial progresses. If
the combined event rate is less than anticipated, either increasing the number of
patients, extending the length of follow-up, or a balance of adjusting both factors may
be necessary to achieve the sample size of 1612 events.
[0632]     Before completing the enrollment phase of the trial, i.e. approximately 3- to
6-months prior to the projected enrollment of the 7990th patient, the actual event rate
based on pooled, blinded accumulation of primary efficacy endpoint events will be
calculated and plotted. If those analyses suggest the number of patients with at least 1
                                             77

adjudicated, primary event (and appropriately accounting for patients with potential
primary events for which the adjudication process is then incomplete) is consistent
with projections, then the study could continue toward the protocol-specified target
enrollment of 7990 patients. However, if the number of such events appears less than,
and inconsistent with projections, the Sponsor will consider (under blinded conditions)
re-calculating the number of patients needed to achieve the target number of events
within the desired timeline or extend the follow-up period. If the projected increase in
number of patients is < 25% of the original 7990 target population, the Sponsor may,
with documented approval of both the REDUCE-IT Steering Committee (SC) and the
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), extend enrollment to the revised target number
without need for an additional protocol amendment. Under those conditions, all
principal investigators, ethics committees, and regulatory authorities associated with
the protocol will be promptly notified of the action. Should the projected increase in
number of patients be more than 25% above the original 7990 target (i.e. more than
1998 additional patients) a formal protocol amendment will be initiated.
[0633]     If the number of patients to be studied is increased, the enrollment phase
will be extended to allow enrollment of the additional patients.
[0634]     At completion of study enrollment, the actual number of patients
randomized may vary from the target number (either original or revised) as a result of
the inherent lag between the date the last patient started screening and the date the last
patient was randomized.
MONITORING, DATA MANAGEMENT, AND RECORD KEEPING
[0635]     Data Management
[0636]     Data Handling
[0637]     Data will be recorded at the site on CRFs. All entries on a CRF are
ultimately the responsibility of the Investigator, who is expected to review each form
for completeness and accuracy before signing. A CRF must be completed for each
randomized patient. The CRFs and source documents must be made available to the
Sponsor and/or its designee.
                                             78

[0638]      Record Keeping
[0639]      The Investigator must maintain all documents and records, originals or
certified copies of original records, relating to the conduct of this trial, and necessary
for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical trial. This documentation includes,
but is not limited to protocol, CRFs, AE reports, patient source data (including records
of patients, patient visit logs, clinical observations and findings), correspondence with
health authorities and IRB, consent forms, inventory of study product, Investigator's
curriculum vitae, monitor visit logs, laboratory reference ranges and laboratory
certification or quality control procedures, and laboratory director curriculum vitae.
[0640]      The Investigator and affiliated institution should maintain the trial
documents as required by the applicable regulations. The Investigator and affiliated
institution should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of
documents. Clinical trial documents must be kept in the clinical site's archives
indefinitely, unless written authorization is obtained from the Sponsor.
DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS
[0641]      The investigator and research institution agree that the Sponsor, their
representatives and designees, the IRB or IEC, and representatives from worldwide
regulatory agencies will have the right, both during and after the clinical trial, to
review and inspect pertinent medical records related to the clinical trial.
QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
[0642]      The Sponsor and/or its designee(s) will perform quality control and quality
assurance checks of all clinical trials that it sponsors. Before the enrollment of any
patient in this study, the Sponsor or its designee will review with the investigator and
site personnel the following documents: protocol, Investigator's Brochure, CRFs and
procedures for their completion, the informed consent process, and the procedure for
reporting SAEs. Site visits will be performed by the Sponsor and/or its designees.
During these visits, information recorded on the CRFs will be verified against source
documents and requests for clarification or correction may be made. After the CRF
data is entered by the site, the Sponsor or designee will review for safety information,
                                               79

completeness, accuracy, and logical consistency. Computer programs that identify data
inconsistencies may be used to help monitor the clinical trial. If necessary, requests for
clarification or correction will be sent to investigators.
[0643]      By signing the protocol, the Sponsor agrees directly or through its
designee(s) to be responsible for implementing and maintaining quality control and
quality assurance systems with written standard operating procedures to ensure that
trials are conducted and data are generated, documented, and reported in compliance
with the protocol, accepted standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), International
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and other applicable regulations.
COMPLETION OF STUDY
[0644]      The end of the study will be at the time of the last patient-last visit of the
follow-up period of the study. The IRB and IEC will be notified about the end of the
study according to country-specific regulatory requirements.
