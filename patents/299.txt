                                        BACKGROUND
   [004]         Regulatory elements are genetic elements that regulate gene activity by
modulating the transcription of an operably linked transcribable DNA molecule.            Such
elements may include promoters, leaders, introns, and 3' untranslated regions and are useful
in the field of plant molecular biology and plant genetic engineering.

constructs comprising the regulatory elements. The invention also provides transgenic plant
cells, plants, and seeds comprising the regulatory elements.      In one embodiment disclosed

elements disclosed herein, including constructs comprising the regulatory elements, and the
transgenic plant cells, plants, and seeds comprising the regulatory elements operably linked to

      WO 2014/159434                                                        PCT/US2014/023648
DNA molecules are capable of affecting the expression of an operably linked transcribable DNA
molecule in plant tissues, and therefore regulating gene expression of an operably linked
transgene in transgenic plants. The invention also provides methods of modifying, producing,
and using the same. The invention also provides compositions that include transgenic plant cells,
plants, plant parts, and seeds containing the recombinant DNA molecules of the invention, and
methods for preparing and using the same.
 [0020]          The following definitions and methods are provided to better define the invention
and to guide those of ordinary skill in the art in the practice of the present invention. Unless
otherwise noted, terms are to be understood according to conventional usage by those of ordinary
skill in the relevant art.
DNA Molecules
 [0021]          As used herein, the term "DNA" or "DNA molecule" refers to a double-stranded
DNA molecule of genomic or synthetic origin, i.e., a polymer of deoxyribonucleotide bases. As
used herein, the term "DNA sequence" to the nucleotide sequence of a DNA molecule.            The
nomenclature used herein corresponds to that of Title 37 of the United States Code of Federal
Regulations § 1.822, and set forth in the tables in WIPO Standard ST.25 (1998), Appendix 2,
Tables 1 and 3.
 [0022]          As used herein, a "recombinant DNA molecule" is a DNA molecule comprising a
combination of DNA molecules that would not naturally occur together without human
intervention.    For instance, a recombinant DNA molecule may be a DNA molecule that is
comprised of at least two DNA molecules heterologous with respect to each other, a DNA
molecule that comprises a DNA sequence that deviates from DNA sequences that exist in nature,
or a DNA molecule that has been incorporated into a host cell's DNA by genetic transformation.
 [0023]          As used herein, the term "sequence identity" refers to the extent to which two
optimally aligned DNA sequences are identical. An optimal sequence alignment is created by
manually aligning two sequences, e.g., a reference sequence and another DNA sequence, to
maximize the number of nucleotide matches in the sequence alignment with appropriate internal
nucleotide insertions, deletions, or gaps. As used herein, the term "reference sequence" refers to
a DNA sequence provided as SEQ ID NOs: 1-37.
                                                 4

     WO 2014/159434                                                            PCT/US2014/023648
 [0024]         As used herein, the term "percent sequence identity" or "percent identity" or
identity" is the identity fraction multiplied by 100. The "identity fraction" for a DNA sequence
optimally aligned with a reference sequence is the number of nucleotide matches in the optimal
alignment, divided by the total number of nucleotides in the reference sequence, e.g., the total
number of nucleotides in the full length of the entire reference sequence. Thus, one embodiment
of the invention provides a DNA molecule comprising a DNA sequence that, when optimally
aligned to a reference sequence, provided herein as SEQ ID NOs: 1-37, has at least about 85
percent identity, at least about 86 percent identity, at least about 87 percent identity, at least
about 88 percent identity, at least about 89 percent identity, at least about 90 percent identity, at
least about 91 percent identity, at least about 92 percent identity, at least about 93 percent
identity, at least about 94 percent identity, at least about 95 percent identity, at least about 96
percent identity, at least about 97 percent identity, at least about 98 percent identity, at least
about 99 percent identity, or at least about 100 percent identity to the reference sequence.
Regulatory Elements
 [0025]         Regulatory elements      such as promoters,      leaders, enhancers,    introns, and
transcription termination regions (or 3' UTRs) play an integral part in the overall expression of
genes in living cells. The term "regulatory element," as used herein, refers to a DNA molecule
having gene-regulatory activity. The term "gene-regulatory activity," as used herein, refers to
the ability to affect the expression of an operably linked transcribable DNA molecule, for
instance by affecting the transcription and/or translation of the operably linked transcribable
DNA molecule.       Regulatory elements, such as promoters, leaders, enhancers, introns and 3'
UTRs that function in plants are therefore useful for modifying plant phenotypes through genetic
engineering.
 [0026]         As used herein, a "regulatory expression element group" or "EXP" sequence may
refer to a group of operably linked regulatory elements, such as enhancers, promoters, leaders,
and introns. Thus, a regulatory expression element group may be comprised, for instance, of a
promoter operably linked 5' to a leader sequence, which is in turn operably linked 5' to an intron
sequence.
                                                  5

      WO 2014/159434                                                            PCT/US2014/023648
 [0027]         Regulatory elements may be characterized by their gene expression pattern, e.g.,
positive and/or negative effects such as constitutive, temporal, spatial, developmental, tissue,
environmental, physiological, pathological, cell cycle, and/or chemically responsive expression,
and any combination thereof, as well as by quantitative or qualitative indications.           As used
herein, a "gene expression pattern" is any pattern of transcription of an operably linked DNA
molecule into a transcribed RNA molecule. The transcribed RNA molecule may be translated to
produce a protein molecule or may provide an antisense or other regulatory RNA molecule, such
as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a transfer RNA (tRNA), a ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a
microRNA (miRNA), and the like.
 [0028]         As used herein, the term "protein expression" is any pattern of translation of a
transcribed RNA molecule into a protein molecule. Protein expression may be characterized by
its temporal, spatial, developmental, or morphological qualities, as well as by quantitative or
qualitative indications.
 [0029]         A promoter is useful as a regulatory element for modulating the expression of an
operably linked transcribable DNA molecule.          As used herein, the term "promoter" refers
generally to a DNA molecule that is involved in recognition and binding of RNA polymerase II
and other proteins, such as trans-acting transcription factors, to initiate transcription. A promoter
may be initially identified from the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of a gene.            Alternately,
promoters may be synthetically produced or manipulated DNA molecules. Promoters may also
be chimeric. Chimeric promoters are produced through the fusion of two or more heterologous
DNA molecules. Promoters useful in practicing the invention include SEQ ID NOs: 32 and 36,
including fragments or variants thereof. In specific embodiments of the invention, the claimed
DNA molecules and any variants or derivatives thereof as described herein, are further defined
as comprising promoter activity, i.e., are capable of acting as a promoter in a host cell, such as in
a transgenic plant.      In still further specific embodiments, a fragment may be defined as
exhibiting promoter activity possessed by the starting promoter molecule from which it is
derived, or a fragment may comprise a "minimal promoter" which provides a basal level of
transcription and is comprised of a TATA box or equivalent DNA sequence for recognition and
binding of the RNA polymerase II complex for initiation of transcription.

     WO 2014/159434                                                            PCT/US2014/023648
 [0030]         In one embodiment, fragments of a promoter sequence disclosed herein are
provided. Promoter fragments may comprise promoter activity, as described above, and may be
useful alone or in combination with other promoters and promoter fragments, such as in
constructing chimeric promoters, or in combination with other EXPs and EXP fragments.                In
specific embodiments, fragments of a promoter are provided comprising at least about 50, at
least about 75, at least about 95, at least about 100, at least about 125, at least about 150, at least
about 175, at least about 200, at least about 225, at least about 250, at least about 275, at least
about 300, at least about 500, at least about 600, at least about 700, at least about 750, at least
about 800, at least about 900, or at least about 1000 contiguous nucleotides, or longer, of a DNA
molecule having promoter activity as disclosed herein. Methods for producing such fragments
from a starting promoter molecule are well known in the art.
 [0031]         Compositions derived from any of the promoters presented as SEQ ID NOs: 32
and 36, such as internal or 5' deletions, for example, can be produced using methods well known
in the art to improve or alter expression, including by removing elements that have either
positive or negative effects on expression; duplicating elements that have positive or negative
effects on expression; and/or duplicating or removing elements that have tissue- or cell-specific
effects on expression. Compositions derived from any of the promoters presented as SEQ ID
NOs: 32 and 36 comprised of 3' deletions in which the TATA box element or equivalent
sequence thereof and downstream sequence is removed can be used, for example, to make
enhancer elements. Further deletions can be made to remove any elements that have positive or
negative; tissue specific; cell specific; or timing specific (such as, but not limited to, circadian
rhythm) effects on expression. Any of the promoters presented as SEQ ID NOs: 32 and 36 and
fragments or enhancers derived therefrom can be used to make chimeric transcriptional
regulatory element compositions.
 [0032]         In accordance with the invention, a promoter or promoter fragment may be
analyzed for the presence of known promoter elements, i.e., DNA sequence characteristics, such
as a TATA box and other known transcription factor binding site motifs. Identification of such
known promoter elements may be used by one of skill in the art to design variants of the
promoter having a similar expression pattern to the original promoter.

     WO 2014/159434                                                          PCT/US2014/023648
 [0033]          As used herein, the term "leader" refers to a DNA molecule identified from the
untranslated 5' region (5' UTR) of a gene and defined generally as a nucleotide segment between
the transcription start site (TSS) and the protein coding sequence start site. Alternately, leaders
may be synthetically produced or manipulated DNA elements.            A leader can be used as a 5'
regulatory element for modulating expression of an operably linked transcribable DNA
molecule.    Leader molecules may be used with a heterologous promoter or with their native
promoter.    Leaders useful in practicing the invention include SEQ ID NOs: 33 and 37 or
fragments or variants thereof. In specific embodiments, such DNA sequences may be defined as
being capable of acting as a leader in a host cell, including, for example, a transgenic plant cell.
In one embodiment, such DNA sequences may be decoded as comprising leader activity.
 [0034]          The leader sequences presented as SEQ ID NOs: 33 and 37 may be comprised of
regulatory elements, or may adopt secondary structures that can have an effect on transcription
or translation of an operably linked transcribable DNA molecule.            The leader sequences
presented as SEQ ID NOs: 33 and 37 can be used in accordance with the invention to make
chimeric regulatory elements that affect transcription or translation of an operably linked DNA
molecule.
 [0035]          As used herein, the term "intron" refers to a DNA molecule that may be identified
from a gene and may be defined generally as a region spliced out during messenger RNA
(mRNA) processing prior to translation. Alternately, an intron may be a synthetically produced
or manipulated DNA element. An intron may contain enhancer elements that effect the
transcription of operably linked genes.      An intron may be used as a regulatory element for
modulating expression of an operably linked transcribable DNA molecule.           A construct may
comprise an intron, and the intron may or may not be heterologous with respect to the
transcribable DNA molecule. Examples of introns in the art include the rice actin intron and the
corn HSP70 intron.
 [0036]          In plants, the inclusion of some introns in gene constructs leads to increased
mRNA and protein accumulation relative to constructs lacking the intron. This effect has been
termed "intron mediated enhancement" (IME) of gene expression. Introns known to stimulate
expression in plants have been identified in maize genes (e.g., tubAl, Adhl, Shl, and Ubil), in
rice genes (e.g., tpi) and in dicotyledonous plant genes like those from petunia (e.g., rbcS), potato
                                                  8

      WO 2014/159434                                                           PCT/US2014/023648
(e.g., st-lsl) and from Arabidopsis thaliana (e.g., ubq3 and pat1).          It has been shown that
deletions or mutations within the splice sites of an intron reduce gene expression, indicating that
splicing might be needed for IME. However, IME in dicotyledonous plants has been shown by
point mutations within the splice sites of the pat1 gene from A. thaliana. Multiple uses of the
same intron in one plant has been shown, in certain circumstances, to exhibit disadvantages. In
those cases, it is necessary to have a collection of basic control elements for the construction of
appropriate recombinant DNA elements.
 [0037]          Introns useful in practicing the invention include SEQ IN NO: 34. Compositions
derived from the intron presented as SEQ ID NO: 34 can be comprised of internal deletions or
duplications of cis-regulatory elements; and/or alterations of the 5' and 3' DNA sequences
comprising the intron/exon splice junctions can be used to improve expression or specificity of
expression when operably linked to a promoter + leader or chimeric promoter + leader and
coding sequence.      When modifying intron/exon boundary sequences, it may be beneficial to
avoid using the nucleotide sequence AT or the nucleotide A just prior to the 5' end of the splice
site (GT) and the nucleotide G or the nucleotide sequence TG, respectively, just after the 3' end
of the splice site (AG) to eliminate the potential of unwanted start codons from being formed
during processing of the messenger RNA into the final transcript. The DNA sequence around
the 5' or 3' end splice junction sites of the intron can thus be modified in this manner. Intron and
intron variants altered as described herein and through methods known in the art can be tested
empirically as described in the working examples to determine the intron's effect on expression
of an operably linked DNA molecule.            Alterations of the 5' and 3' regions comprising the
intron/exon splice junction can also be made to reduce the potential for introduction of false start
and stop codons being produced in the resulting transcript after processing and splicing of the
messenger RNA. The introns can be tested empirically as described in the working examples to
determine the intron's effect on expression of a transgene.
 [0038]         As used herein,       the   terms "3'     transcription termination  molecule,"  "3'
untranslated region" or "3' UTR" refer to a DNA molecule that is used during transcription to
the untranslated region of the 3' portion of an mRNA molecule. The 3' untranslated region of an
mRNA molecule may be generated by specific cleavage and 3' polyadenylation, also known as a
polyA tail. A 3' UTR may be operably linked to and located downstream of a transcribable
DNA molecule and may include a polyadenylation signal and other regulatory signals capable of
                                                    9

      WO 2014/159434                                                         PCT/US2014/023648
affecting transcription, mRNA processing, or gene expression.          PolyA tails are thought to
function in mRNA stability and in initiation of translation.        Examples of 3' transcription
termination molecules in the art are the nopaline synthase 3' region; wheat hspl7 3' region, pea
rubisco small subunit 3' region, cotton E6 3' region, and the coixin 3' UTR.
 [0039]         3' UTRs typically find beneficial use for the recombinant expression of specific
DNA molecules. A weak 3' UTR has the potential to generate read-through, which may affect
the expression of the DNA molecule located in the neighboring expression cassettes.
Appropriate control of transcription termination can prevent read-through into DNA sequences
(e.g., other expression cassettes) localized downstream and can further allow efficient recycling
of RNA polymerase to improve gene expression. Efficient termination of transcription (release
of RNA polymerase II from the DNA) is prerequisite for re-initiation of transcription and thereby
directly affects the overall transcript level. Subsequent to transcription termination, the mature
mRNA is released from the site of synthesis and template transported to the cytoplasm.
Eukaryotic mRNAs are accumulated as poly(A) forms in vivo, making it difficult to detect
transcriptional termination sites by conventional methods. However, prediction of functional and
efficient 3' UTRs by bioinformatics methods can be difficult in that there are few conserved
DNA sequences that would allow for easy prediction of an effective 3' UTR.
 [0040]         From a practical standpoint, it is typically beneficial that a 3' UTR used in an
expression cassette possesses the following characteristics.     The 3' UTR should be able to
efficiently and effectively terminate transcription of the transgene and prevent read-through of
the transcript into any neighboring DNA sequence, which can be comprised of another
expression cassette as in the case of multiple expression cassettes residing in one transfer DNA
(T-DNA), or the neighboring chromosomal DNA into which the T-DNA has inserted. In plant
biotechnology, the 3' UTR is often used for priming of amplification reactions of reverse
transcribed RNA extracted from the transformed plant and used to: (1) assess the transcriptional
activity or expression of the expression cassette once integrated into the plant chromosome; (2)
assess the copy number of insertions within the plant DNA; and (3) assess zygosity of the
resulting seed after breeding.    The 3' UTR is also used in amplification reactions of DNA
extracted from the transformed plant to characterize the intactness of the inserted cassette.

 [0041]          As used herein, the term "enhancer" or "enhancer element" refers to a cis-acting
regulatory element, a.k.a. cis-element, which confers an aspect of the overall expression pattern,
but is usually insufficient alone to drive transcription, of an operably linked transcribable DNA
molecule. Unlike promoters, enhancer elements do not usually include a transcription start site
(TSS) or TATA box or equivalent DNA sequence.              A promoter or promoter fragment may
naturally comprise one or more enhancer elements that affect the transcription of an operably
linked transcribable DNA molecule. An enhancer element may also be fused to a promoter to
produce a chimeric promoter cis-element, which confers an aspect of the overall modulation of
gene expression.
 [0042]          Many promoter enhancer elements are believed to bind DNA-binding proteins
and/or affect DNA topology, producing local conformations that selectively allow or restrict
access of RNA polymerase to the DNA template or that facilitate selective opening of the double
helix at the site of transcriptional initiation.     An enhancer element may function to bind
transcription factors that regulate transcription. Some enhancer elements bind more than one
transcription factor, and transcription factors may interact with different affinities with more than
one enhancer domain. Enhancer elements can be identified by a number of techniques, including
deletion analysis, i.e., deleting one or more nucleotides from the 5' end or internal to a promoter;
DNA      binding   protein   analysis  using   DNase   I footprinting,    methylation    interference,
electrophoresis mobility-shift assays,      in vivo genomic footprinting by ligation-mediated
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and other conventional assays; or by DNA sequence similarity
analysis using known cis-element motifs or enhancer elements as a target sequence or target
motif with conventional DNA sequence comparison methods, such as BLAST.                      The fine
structure of an enhancer domain can be further studied by mutagenesis (or substitution) of one or
more nucleotides or by other conventional methods known in the art. Enhancer elements can be
obtained by chemical synthesis or by isolation from regulatory elements that include such
elements, and they can be synthesized with additional flanking nucleotides that contain useful
restriction enzyme sites to facilitate subsequence manipulation. Thus, the design, construction,
and use of enhancer elements according to the methods disclosed herein for modulating the
expression of operably linked transcribable DNA molecules are encompassed by the invention.

 [0043]          As used herein, the term "chimeric" refers to a single DNA molecule produced by
fusing a first DNA molecule to a second DNA molecule, where neither the first nor the second
DNA molecule would normally be found in that configuration, i.e., fused to the other.            The
chimeric DNA molecule is thus a new DNA molecule not otherwise normally found in nature.
As used herein, the term "chimeric promoter" refers to a promoter produced through such
manipulation of DNA molecules.          A chimeric promoter may combine two or more DNA
fragments, for example, the fusion of a promoter to an enhancer element.           Thus, the design,
construction, and use of chimeric promoters according to the methods disclosed herein for
modulating the expression of operably linked transcribable DNA molecules are encompassed by
the present invention.
 [0044]          As used herein, the term "variant" refers to a second DNA molecule, such as a
regulatory element, that is similar in composition, but not identical to, a first DNA molecule, and
wherein the second DNA molecule still maintains the general functionality, i.e., same or similar
expression pattern, for instance through more or less or equivalent transcriptional or translational
activity, of the first DNA molecule. A variant may be a shorter or truncated version of the first
DNA molecule and/or an altered version of the sequence of the first DNA molecule, such as one
with different restriction enzyme sites and/or internal deletions, substitutions, and/or insertions.
A "variant" can also encompass a regulatory element having a nucleotide sequence comprising a
substitution, deletion, and/or insertion of one or more nucleotides of a reference sequence,
wherein the derivative regulatory element has more or less or equivalent transcriptional or
translational activity than the corresponding parent regulatory molecule.         Regulatory element
"variants" also encompass variants arising from mutations that occur during or as a result of
bacterial and plant cell transformation. In the invention, a DNA sequence provided as SEQ ID
NOs: 1-37 may be used to create variants that are in similar in composition, but not identical to,
the DNA sequence of the original regulatory element, while still maintaining the general
functionality, i.e., the same or similar expression pattern, of the original regulatory element.
Production of such variants of the invention is well within the ordinary skill of the art in light of
the disclosure and is encompassed within the scope of the invention.
 [0045]          Chimeric regulatory elements can be designed to comprise various constituent
elements which may be operatively linked by various methods known in the art, such as
                                                 12

restriction enzyme digestion and ligation, ligation independent cloning, modular assembly of
PCR products during amplification, or direct chemical synthesis of the regulatory element, as
well as other methods known in the art. The resulting various chimeric regulatory elements can
be comprised of the same, or variants of the same, constituent elements but differ in the DNA
sequence or DNA sequences that comprise the linking DNA sequence or sequences that allow
the constituent parts to be operatively linked. In the invention, a DNA sequence provided as
SEQ ID NOs: 1-30 or 31-37 may provide a regulatory element reference sequence, wherein the
constituent elements that comprise the reference sequence may be joined by methods known in
the art and may comprise substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions of one or more nucleotides or
mutations that naturally occur in bacterial and plant cell transformation.
 [0046]         The efficacy of the modifications, duplications, or deletions described herein on
the desired expression aspects of a particular transcribable DNA molecule may be tested
empirically in stable and transient plant assays, such as those described in the working examples
herein, so as to validate the results, which may vary depending upon the changes made and the
goal of the change in the starting DNA molecule.
Constructs
 [0047]         As used herein, the term "construct" means any recombinant DNA molecule such
as a plasmid, cosmid, virus, phage, or linear or circular DNA or RNA molecule, derived from
any source, capable of genomic integration or autonomous replication, comprising a DNA
molecule where at least one DNA molecule has been linked to another DNA molecule in a
functionally operative manner, i.e., operably linked. As used herein, the term "vector" means
any construct that may be used for the purpose of transformation, i.e., the introduction of
heterologous DNA or RNA into a host cell.           A construct typically includes one or more
expression cassettes.    As used herein, an "expression cassette" refers to a DNA molecule
comprising at least a transcribable DNA molecule operably linked to one or more regulatory
elements, typically at least a promoter and a 3' UTR.
 [0048]         As used herein, the term "operably linked" refers to a first DNA molecule joined
to a second DNA molecule, wherein the first and second DNA molecules are arranged so that the
first DNA molecule affects the function of the second DNA molecule. The two DNA molecules
                                                 13

may or may not be part of a single contiguous DNA molecule and may or may not be adjacent.
For example, a promoter is operably linked to a transcribable DNA molecule if the promoter is
capable of affecting the transcription or translation of the transcribable DNA molecule.
 [0049]         The constructs of the invention may be provided, in one embodiment, as double
tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid border constructs that have the right border (RB or AGRtu.RB) and
left border (LB or AGRtu.LB) regions of the Ti plasmid isolated from Agrobacterium
tumefaciens comprising a T-DNA that, along with transfer molecules provided by the A.
tumefaciens cells, permit the integration of the T-DNA into the genome of a plant cell (see, e.g.,
U.S. Patent 6,603,061).    The constructs may also contain the plasmid backbone DNA segments
that provide replication function and antibiotic selection in bacterial cells, e.g., an Escherichia
coli origin of replication such as ori322, a broad host range origin of replication such as oriV or
oriRi, and a coding region for a selectable marker such as Spec/Strp that encodes for Tn7
aminoglycoside      adenyltransferase   (aadA)     conferring    resistance  to   spectinomycin   or
streptomycin, or a gentamicin (Gm, Gent) selectable marker gene. For plant transformation, the
host bacterial strain is often A. tumefaciens ABI, C58, or LBA4404; however, other strains
known to those skilled in the art of plant transformation can function in the invention.
 [0050]         Methods are known in the art for assembling and introducing constructs into a cell
in such a manner that the transcribable DNA molecule is transcribed into a functional mRNA
molecule that is translated and expressed as a protein.           For the practice of the invention,
conventional compositions and methods for preparing and using constructs and host cells are
well known to one skilled in the art.       For example, typical vectors useful for expression of
nucleic acids in higher plants are well known in the art and include vectors derived from the Ti
plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the pCaMVCN transfer control vector.
 [0051]         Various regulatory elements may be included in a construct, including any of
those provided herein. Any such regulatory elements may be provided in combination with other
regulatory elements.     Such combinations can be designed or modified to produce desirable
regulatory features. In one embodiment, constructs of the invention comprise at least one
regulatory element operably linked to a transcribable DNA molecule operably linked to a 3'
UTR.

 [0052]         Constructs of the invention may include any promoter or leader provided herein
or known in the art. For example, a promoter of the invention may be operably linked to a
heterologous non-translated 5' leader such as one derived from a heat shock protein gene.
Alternatively, a leader of the invention may be operably linked to a heterologous promoter such
as the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S transcript promoter.
 [0053]         Expression cassettes may also include a transit peptide coding sequence that
encodes a peptide that is useful for sub-cellular targeting of an operably linked protein,
particularly to a chloroplast, leucoplast, or other plastid organelle; mitochondria; peroxisome;
vacuole; or an extracellular location.   Many chloroplast-localized proteins are expressed from
nuclear genes as precursors and are targeted to the chloroplast by a chloroplast transit peptide
(CTP).    Examples of such isolated chloroplast proteins include, but are not limited to, those
associated with the small subunit (SSU) of ribulose-1,5,-bisphosphate carboxylase, ferredoxin,
ferredoxin oxidoreductase, the light-harvesting complex protein I and protein II, thioredoxin F,
and enolpyruvyl shikimate phosphate synthase (EPSPS).            Chloroplast transit peptides are
described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 7,193,133.        It has been demonstrated that non
chloroplast proteins may be targeted to the chloroplast by the expression of a heterologous CTP
operably linked to the transcribable DNA molecule encoding non-chloroplast proteins.
Transcribable DNA molecules
 [0054]         As used herein, the term "transcribable DNA molecule" refers to any DNA
molecule capable of being transcribed into a RNA molecule, including, but not limited to, those
having protein coding sequences and those producing RNA molecules having sequences useful
for gene suppression.    The type of DNA molecule can include, but is not limited to, a DNA
molecule from the same plant, a DNA molecule from another plant, a DNA molecule from a
different organism, or a synthetic DNA molecule, such as a DNA molecule containing an
antisense message of a gene, or a DNA molecule encoding an artificial, synthetic, or otherwise
modified version of a transgene. Exemplary transcribable DNA molecules for incorporation into
constructs of the invention include, e.g., DNA molecules or genes from a species other than the
species into which the DNA molecule is incorporated or genes that originate from, or are present
in, the same species, but are incorporated into recipient cells by genetic engineering methods
rather than classical breeding techniques.

      WO 2014/159434                                                         PCT/US2014/023648
 [0055]          A "transgene" refers to a transcribable DNA molecule heterologous to a host cell
at least with respect to its location in the host cell genome and/or a transcribable DNA molecule
artificially incorporated into a host cell's genome in the current or any prior generation of the
cell.
 [0056]          A regulatory element, such as a promoter of the invention, may be operably
linked to a transcribable DNA molecule that is heterologous with respect to the regulatory
element. As used herein, the term "heterologous" refers to the combination of two or more DNA
molecules when such a combination is not normally found in nature. For example, the two DNA
molecules may be derived from different species and/or the two DNA molecules may be derived
from different genes, e.g., different genes from the same species or the same genes from different
species.     A regulatory element is thus heterologous with respect to an operably linked
transcribable DNA molecule if such a combination is not normally found in nature, i.e., the
transcribable DNA molecule does not naturally occur operably linked to the regulatory element.
 [0057]          The transcribable DNA molecule may generally be any DNA molecule for which
expression of a transcript is desired. Such expression of a transcript may result in translation of
the resulting mRNA molecule, and thus protein expression.            Alternatively, for example, a
transcribable DNA molecule may be designed to ultimately cause decreased expression of a
specific gene or protein. In one embodiment, this may be accomplished by using a transcribable
DNA molecule that is oriented in the antisense direction.       One of ordinary skill in the art is
familiar with using such antisense technology. Any gene may be negatively regulated in this
manner, and, in one embodiment, a transcribable DNA molecule may be designed for
suppression of a specific gene through expression of a dsRNA, siRNA or miRNA molecule.
  [0058]         Thus, one embodiment of the invention is a recombinant DNA molecule
comprising a regulatory element of the invention, such as those provided as SEQ ID NOs: 1-37,
operably linked to a heterologous transcribable DNA molecule so as to modulate transcription of
the transcribable DNA molecule at a desired level or in a desired pattern when the construct is
integrated in the genome of a transgenic plant cell. In one embodiment, the transcribable DNA
molecule comprises a protein-coding region of a gene and in another embodiment the
transcribable DNA molecule comprises an antisense region of a gene.

Genes of Agronomic Interest
 [0059]         A transcribable DNA molecule may be a gene of agronomic interest. As used
herein, the term "gene of agronomic interest" refers to a transcribable DNA molecule that, when
expressed in a particular plant tissue, cell, or cell type, confers a desirable characteristic. The
product of a gene of agronomic interest may act within the plant in order to cause an effect upon
the plant morphology, physiology, growth, development, yield, grain composition, nutritional
profile, disease or pest resistance, and/or environmental or chemical tolerance or may act as a
pesticidal agent in the diet of a pest that feeds on the plant. In one embodiment of the invention,
a regulatory element of the invention is incorporated into a construct such that the regulatory
element is operably linked to a transcribable DNA molecule that is a gene of agronomic interest.
In a transgenic plant containing such a construct, the expression of the gene of agronomic
interest can confer a beneficial agronomic trait. A beneficial agronomic trait may include, for
example, but is not limited to, herbicide tolerance, insect control, modified yield, disease
resistance, pathogen resistance, modified plant growth and development, modified starch
content, modified oil content, modified fatty acid content, modified protein content, modified
fruit ripening, enhanced animal and human nutrition, biopolymer productions, environmental
stress resistance, pharmaceutical peptides, improved processing qualities, improved flavor,
hybrid seed production utility, improved fiber production, and desirable biofuel production.

invention. As used herein the term "selectable marker transgene" refers to any transcribable
DNA molecule whose expression in a transgenic plant, tissue or cell, or lack thereof, can be
screened for or scored in some way. Selectable marker genes, and their associated selection and
screening techniques, for use in the practice of the invention are known in the art and include,
but are not limited to, transcribable DNA molecules encoding B-glucuronidase (GUS), luciferase,
green fluorescent protein (GFP), proteins that confer antibiotic resistance, and proteins that
confer herbicide tolerance.
Cell Transformation
 [0063]         The invention is also directed to a method of producing transformed cells and
plants that comprise one or more regulatory elements operably linked to a transcribable DNA
molecule.
 [0064]         The term "transformation" refers to the introduction of a DNA molecule into a
recipient host. As used herein, the term "host" refers to bacteria, fungi, or plants, including any
cells, tissues, organs, or progeny of the bacteria, fungi, or plants.    Plant tissues and cells of
particular interest include protoplasts, calli, roots, tubers, seeds, stems, leaves, seedlings,
embryos, and pollen.
 [0065]         As used herein, the term "transformed" refers to a cell, tissue, organ, or organism
into which a foreign DNA molecule, such as a construct, has been introduced. The introduced
DNA molecule may be integrated into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, tissue, organ, or
organism such that the introduced DNA molecule is inherited by subsequent progeny.                A
"transgenic" or "transformed" cell or organism may also includes progeny of the cell or
organism and progeny produced from a breeding program employing such a transgenic organism
as a parent in a cross and exhibiting an altered phenotype resulting from the presence of a foreign
DNA molecule.       The introduced DNA molecule may also be transiently introduced into the
recipient cell such that the introduced DNA molecule is not inherited by subsequent progeny.
The term "transgenic" refers to a bacterium, fungus, or plant containing one or more
heterologous DNA molecules.

 [0066]         There are many methods well known to those of skill in the art for introducing
DNA molecules into plant cells.        The process generally comprises the steps of selecting a
suitable host cell, transforming the host cell with a vector, and obtaining the transformed host
cell. Methods and materials for transforming plant cells by introducing a construct into a plant
genome in the practice of this invention can include any of the well-known and demonstrated
methods.      Suitable methods     include, but are not limited to, bacterial infection (e.g.,
Agrobacterium), binary BAC vectors, direct delivery of DNA              (e.g., by PEG-mediated
transformation, desiccation/inhibition-mediated DNA uptake, electroporation, agitation with
silicon carbide fibers, and acceleration of DNA coated particles), among others.
 [0067]         Host cells may be any cell or organism, such as a plant cell, algal cell, algae,
fungal cell, fungi, bacterial cell, or insect cell. In specific embodiments, the host cells and
transformed cells may include cells from crop plants.
 [0068]         A transgenic plant subsequently may be regenerated from a transgenic plant cell
of the invention.     Using conventional breeding techniques or self-pollination, seed may be
produced from this transgenic plant. Such seed, and the resulting progeny plant grown from
such seed, will contain the recombinant DNA molecule of the invention, and therefore will be
transgenic.
 [0069]         Transgenic plants of the invention can be self-pollinated to provide seed for
homozygous transgenic plants of the invention (homozygous for the recombinant DNA
molecule) or crossed with non-transgenic plants or different transgenic plants to provide seed for
heterozygous transgenic plants of the invention (heterozygous for the recombinant DNA
molecule). Both such homozygous and heterozygous transgenic plants are referred to herein as
"progeny plants."    Progeny plants are transgenic plants descended from the original transgenic
plant and containing the recombinant DNA molecule of the invention. Seeds produced using a
transgenic plant of the invention can be harvested and used to grow generations of transgenic
plants, i.e., progeny plants of the invention, comprising the construct of this invention and
expressing a gene of agronomic interest. Descriptions of breeding methods that are commonly
used for different crops can be found in one of several reference books, see, e.g., Allard,

 [0070]         The transformed plants may be analyzed for the presence of the gene or genes of
interest and the expression level and/or profile conferred by the regulatory elements of the
invention. Those of skill in the art are aware of the numerous methods available for the analysis
of transformed plants. For example, methods for plant analysis include, but are not limited to,
Southern blots or northern blots, PCR-based approaches, biochemical analyses, phenotypic
screening methods, field evaluations, and immunodiagnostic assays. The expression of a
transcribable DNA molecule can be measured using TaqMan@ (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) reagents and methods as described by the manufacturer and PCR cycle times
determined using the TaqMan@ Testing Matrix.             Alternatively, the Invader@ (Third Wave
Technologies, Madison, WI) reagents and methods as described by the manufacturer can be used
to evaluate transgene expression.
 [0071]         The invention also provides for parts of a plant of the invention.       Plant parts
include, but are not limited to, leaves, stems, roots, tubers, seeds, endosperm, ovule, and pollen.
Plant parts of the invention may be viable, nonviable, regenerable, and/or non-regenerable. The
invention also includes and provides transformed plant cells comprising a DNA molecule of the
invention. The transformed or transgenic plant cells of the invention include regenerable and/or
non-regenerable plant cells.
 [0072]         The invention also provides a commodity product that is produced from a
transgenic plant or part thereof containing the recombinant DNA molecule of the invention.
Commodity products of the invention contain a detectable amount of DNA comprising a DNA
sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1-37. As used herein, a "commodity
product" refers to any composition or product which is comprised of material derived from a
transgenic plant, seed, plant cell, or plant part containing the recombinant DNA molecule of the
                                                   21

invention. Commodity products include but are not limited to processed seeds, grains, plant
parts, and meal. A commodity product of the invention will contain a detectable amount of DNA
corresponding to the recombinant DNA molecule of the invention. Detection of one or more of
this DNA in a sample may be used for determining the content or the source of the commodity
product. Any standard method of detection for DNA molecules may be used, including methods
of detection disclosed herein.
 [0073]         The invention may be more readily understood through reference to the following
examples, which are provided by way of illustration, and are not intended to be limiting of the
invention, unless specified.      It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the
techniques disclosed in the following examples represent techniques discovered by the inventors
to function well in the practice of the invention. However, those of skill in the art should, in light
of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments
that are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and
scope of the invention, therefore all matter set forth or shown in the accompanying drawings is to

                                             EXAMPLES
                                              Example 1
                        Identification and Cloning of Regulatory Elements
 [0074]         Regulatory expression element groups (EXPs) and transcription termination
regions (3' UTRs) were identified and cloned from the genomic DNA of the dicot species
Medicago truncatula (Barrel Medic). The selection of the Medicago truncatula3' UTRs was, in
part, based on expression patterns observed in homologous soybean genes.
  [0075]        The identification and cloning of Medicago truncatula 3' UTRs began with the
selection of soybean genes of interest based upon the soybean genes' expression pattern in soy
tissue surveys and proprietary transcript profiling experiments. The selected soybean genes were
then used to find homologous genes in Medicago truncatula using publicly available DNA
sequences.   Next, tissue samples derived from Medicago truncatula were isolated from plants
grown under different environmental conditions. Then, messenger RNA (mRNA) was isolated
                                                   22

      WO 2014/159434                                                       PCT/US2014/023648
from the Medicago tissues and used in real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments to
determine the expression pattern of the Medicago genes. From these experiments, a subset of the
Medicago truncatulagenome was selected for cloning and characterization.
 [0076]         Using public Medicago truncatula sequence data, a bioinformatic analysis was
performed to identify regulatory elements within the selected Medicago gene loci. For example,
bioinformatic analysis was performed to identify 3' UTR sequences that comprise the
polyadenylation and termination regions of the mRNA and sequences extending further to the
end of the identified gene locus. Amplification primers were then designed and used to amplify
each of the identified regulatory element DNA fragments, such as 3' UTR DNA fragments, DNA
fragments comprising a promoter, leader and intron, and DNA fragments comprising a promoter
and leader. The resulting DNA fragments were ligated into base plant expression vectors and
sequenced.
 [0077]         For applicable DNA fragments, an analysis of the regulatory element transcription
start site (TSS) and intron/exon splice junctions was then performed using transformed plant
protoplasts. In this analysis, the protoplasts were transformed with the plant expression vectors
comprising the cloned DNA fragments operably linked to a heterologous transcribable DNA
molecule.    Next, the 5' RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends, Version 2.0
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California 92008) was used to confirm the regulatory element TSS and
intron/exon splice junctions by analyzing the DNA sequence of the produced mRNA transcripts.
 [0078]         The DNA sequences of the identified 3' UTRs are provided herein as SEQ ID
NOs: 1-30.    In addition, identified promoter DNA sequences are provided herein as SEQ ID
NOs: 32 and 36; identified leader DNA sequences are provided herein as SEQ ID NOs: 33 and
37; and an identified intron DNA sequence is provided as SEQ ID NO: 34. Further, the DNA
sequences of the identified EXPs are provided herein as SEQ ID NOs: 31 and 35. The regulatory

      Analysis of the Effect of 3' UTRs on Constitutive GUS Expression in Soybean Leaf
                                             Protoplasts
 [0079]         Soybean leaf protoplasts were transformed with vectors, specifically plasmid
constructs, to assess the effect of selected Medicago truncatula3' UTRs on expression. Soybean
leaf protoplasts were transformed with DNA vectors containing a constitutive EXP sequence
driving expression of the B-glucuronidase (GUS) transgene operably linked to a Medicago 3'
UTR. These Medicago 3' UTR-transformed soybean leaf protoplasts were compared to soybean
leaf protoplast in which expression of the GUS transgene was driven by a constitutive promoter,
and the GUS transgene was operably linked to a 3' UTR derived from Gossypium hirsutum or
Gossypium barbadense.
 [0080]         The plant vectors utilized in these experiments were built using cloning methods
known in the art. The resulting vectors comprised a left border region from A. tumefaciens; a
first transgene expression cassette for selection of transformed plant cells that confers resistance
to either the herbicide glyphosate or the antibiotic spectinomycin (both driven by the Arabidopsis
Actin 7 promoter); a second transgene expression cassette used to assess the activity of the 3'
UTR, which comprised an EXP or promoter sequence operably linked 5' to a DNA sequence for
GUS that possesses a processable intron (GUS-2, SEQ ID NO: 44), which is operably linked 5'
to 3' UTR derived from Medicago truncatula, Gossypium hirsutum, or Gossypium barbadense;
and a right border region from A. tumefaciens. The vectors that comprised a 3' UTR derived

 [0082]         Two plant vectors, specifically plasmid constructs, for use in co-transformation
and normalization of data were also built using cloning methods known in the art. Each of these
plasmid constructs contained a specific luciferase coding sequence that was driven by a
constitutive EXP.      The plant vector pMON19437 comprised an expression cassette with a
constitutive EXP comprising a promoter operably linked 5' to a leader sequence which is
operably linked 5' to an intron (EXP-CaMV.35S-enh+Zm.DnaK: 1:1, SEQ ID NO: 47), operably
linked 5' to a firefly (Photinuspyralis) luciferase coding sequence (LUCIFERASE: 1:3, SEQ ID
NO: 45), operably linked 5' to a 3' UTR from the Agrobacterium tumefaciens nopaline synthase
gene (T-AGRtu.nos-1:1:13, SEQ ID NO: 49).           The plant vector pMON63934 comprised an
expression cassette with a constitutive EXP sequence comprising a promoter operably linked 5'
to a leader sequence (EXP-CaMV.35S-enh-Lhcbl, SEQ ID NO: 48), operably linked 5' to a sea
pansy (Renilla reniformis) luciferase coding sequence (CR-Ren.hRenilla Lucife-0:0:1, SEQ ID
NO: 46), operably linked 5' to a 3' UTR from the Agrobacterium tumefaciens nopaline synthase
gene (T-AGRtu.nos-1:1:13, SEQ ID NO: 49).
 [0083]         The soybean leaf protoplasts were transformed using a polyethylene glycol
(PEG)-based transformation method, as is well known in the art. Each protoplast cell was
transformed with the pMON19437 plasmid construct, the pMON63934 plasmid construct, and
one of the plasmid constructs presented in Table 2.        After transformation, the transformed
soybean leaf protoplasts were incubated overnight in total darkness. Next, measurement of GUS
and luciferase was conducted by placing aliquots of a lysed preparation of transformed cells into
two different small-well trays. One tray was used for GUS measurements, and a second tray was
used to perform a dual luciferase assay using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega
Corp., Madison, WI; see, e.g., Promega Notes Magazine, NO: 57, 1996, p.02).

 [0084]         One or two transformations were performed for each plasmid construct presented
in Table 2. The mean expression values for each 3' UTR were determined from several samples
from each transformation.     Sample measurements were made using four replicates of each
plasmid construct transformation, or alternatively, three replicates of each plasmid construct per
one of two transformation experiments.     The mean GUS and luciferase expression levels are
provided in Table 3.     In this Table, the firefly luciferase values (e.g., from expression of
pMON19437) are provided in the column labeled "FLuc" and the sea pansy luciferase values

 [0086]          As demonstrated in Table 4, GUS expression was enhanced using all of the
selected Medicago 3' UTRs compared to the 3' UTRs derived from Gossypium hirsutum or
Gossypium barbadense. For example, expression of GUS was 2.1- to 18.3-fold higher using a
Medicago-derived 3' UTR based upon the GUS/FLuc ratios normalized with respect to T
Gb.FbL2-1:1:1, the best expressing 3' UTR of those derived from Gossypium hirsutum or
Gossypium barbadense. Similarly, expression of GUS was 1.61- to 10.48-fold higher using a
Medicago-derived 3' UTR based upon the GUS/RLuc ratios normalized with respect to T
Gb.FbL2-1: 1: 1.

 Analysis of the Effect of 3' UTRs on Constitutive GUS Expression in Stably Transformed
                                           Soybean Plants
 [0087]          Soybean plants were transformed with vectors, specifically plasmid constructs, to
assess the effect of selected Medicago truncatula3' UTRs on expression. Specifically, soybean
plants were transformed with vectors containing a constitutive EXP sequence driving expression
of the B-glucuronidase (GUS) transgene operably linked to a Medicago 3' UTR.                  These
Medicago 3' UTR-transformed soybean plants were compared to transformed soybean plants in
which expression of the GUS transgene was driven by a constitutive promoter, and the GUS
transgene was operably linked to a 3' UTR derived from Gossypium barbadense.
 [0088]          The plant vectors utilized in these experiments were built using cloning methods
known in the art. The resulting vectors comprised a left border region from A. tumefaciens; a
first transgene expression cassette for selection of transformed plant cells that confers resistance
to the antibiotic spectinomycin (driven by the Arabidopsis Actin 7 promoter); a second transgene
expression cassette used to assess the activity of the 3' UTR, which comprised the regulatory
expression element group EXP-CaMV.35S-enh+Ph.DnaK:1:3 (SEQ ID NO: 42) operably linked
5' to a coding sequence for GUS that possesses a processable intron (GUS-2, SEQ ID NO: 44),
which is operably linked 5' to a 3' UTR derived from Medicago truncatula or Gossypium
barbadense; and a right border region from A. tumefaciens. The vectors that comprised a 3'
UTR      derived   from   Medicago were          pMON109593,      pMON116803,       pMON116812,

 [0090]        The     soybean   plants   were    transformed   using   Agrobacterium-mediated
transformation methods known in the art. Expression of GUS was assayed qualitatively using
histological sections of selected tissues.   For the histochemical GUS analysis, whole tissue
sections were incubated with the GUS staining solution X-Gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b
glucuronide) (1 mg/ml) for an appropriate length of time, rinsed, and visually inspected for blue
coloration. GUS activity was qualitatively determined by direct visual inspection or inspection
under a microscope using selected plant organs and tissues.       The Ro generation plants were
inspected for expression in Vn5 Root, Vn5 Sink Leaf, Vn5 Source Leaf, RI Source Leaf, RI
Petiole, RI Flower, Yellow Pod Embryo (approximately R8 development stage), Yellow Pod
Cotyledon (approximately R8 development stage), R3 Immature Seed, R3 Pod, and R5
Cotyledon.
 [0091]        The quantitative changes of GUS expression relative to expression imparted by
pMON102167, which comprised the 3' UTR derived from Gossypium barbadense, was also
analyzed, as demonstrated in Tables 6-13.       For this quantitative analysis, total protein was
extracted from selected tissues of transformed plants. One microgram of total protein was used
with the fluorogenic substrate 4-methyleumbelliferyl- -D-glucuronide (MUG) in a total reaction
volume of 50       l.   The reaction product, 4-methlyumbelliferone       (4-MU), is maximally
fluorescent at high pH, where the hydroxyl group is ionized. Addition of a basic solution of
sodium carbonate simultaneously stops the assay and adjusts the pH for quantifying the
fluorescent product. Fluorescence was measured with excitation at 365 nm, emission at 445 nm
using a Fluoromax-3 (Horiba; Kyoto, Japan) with Micromax Reader, with slit width set at
excitation 2 nm, emission 3 nm.
 [0092]         Tables 6 and 7 show the mean quantitative expression levels measured in the Ro
generation plant tissues. Those tissues not assayed are shown as blank cells in both tables.

 [0095]         As demonstrated in Tables 8 and 9, expression in the tissues of transformed
soybean plants comprising different Medicago 3' UTRs was distinct when compared to that of
soybean plants transformed with pMON102167, which comprised a 3' UTR derived from
Gossypium barbadense. For example, two Medicago 3' UTRs, T-Mt.AC145767v28-1:1:2 (SEQ
ID NO: 1) and T-Mt.Lox-1-1:2:1 (SEQ ID NO: 14) caused enhanced expression of the
constitutive EXP, EXP-CaMV.35S-enh+Ph.DnaK:1:3          (SEQ ID NO: 42), across all tissues.
Other Medicago 3' UTRs provided enhanced expression of the constitutive EXP in some tissues,
while reducing expression in others. For example, the 3' UTR T-Mt.Sali3-2-1:2:1 (SEQ ID NO:
26) provided a 2.19- to 8.05-fold increase in expression in the Vn5 Root, Vn5 Sink Leaf, Vn5
Source Leaf, RI Source Leaf, Yellow Pod Embryo, and Yellow Pod Cotyledon, while reducing
expression in the RI Flower and R5 Cotyledon. Further, the 3' UTR T-Mt.AC140914v20-1:2:1
(SEQ ID NO: 2) provided a 1.88- to 4.12-fold increase in expression in Vn5 Root, Vn5 Sink
Leaf, Vn5 Source Leaf, Yellow Pod Embryo, Yellow Pod Cotyledon, R3 Immature Seed, and R5
Cotyledon, while reducing expression in the RI Source Leaf, RI Flower, and keeping expression
relatively the same in the R3 Pod. In addition, the 3' UTR T-Mt.Oxr-1:2:1 (SEQ ID NO: 17)
provided a 2.19-to 10.90-fold increase in expression in Vn5 Root, Vn5 Sink Leaf, Vn5 Source
Leaf, RI Source Leaf, Yellow Pod Embryo, Yellow Pod Cotyledon, and R3 Pod, while reducing
expression in the RI Flower and R5 Cotyledon, and keeping expression relatively the same in R3

   [0098]        As demonstrated      in Tables 12 and 13, several of the Medicago 3' UTRs
  enhanced expression of the constitutive EXP element, EXP-CaMV.35S-enh+Ph.DnaK:1:3 (SEQ
  ID NO: 42), relative to plants transformed with pMON102167, which comprised a 3' UTR
  derived from Gossypium barbadense in the R1 generation.           For example, the 3' UTR T
  Mt.AC145767v28-1:1:2 (SEQ ID NO: 1) provided a 3.10- to 21.65-fold enhancement of GUS
  expression in all of the tissues assayed.   The 3' UTR T-Mt.Sali3-2-1:2:1 (SEQ ID NO: 26)
  provided a 1.52- to 8.90-fold enhancement of GUS expression in all of the tissues assayed. The
  3' UTR T-Mt.Oxr-1:2:1 (SEQ ID NO: 17) provided enhancement in most tissues, but reduced
  expression in the R3 Immature Seed relative to plants transformed with T-Gb.E6-3b: 1:1 (SEQ ID
  NO: 40).
    [0099]       The forgoing experiments demonstrate that the Medicago truncatula derived 3'
  UTR elements       affected expression of the constitutive EXP element         EXP-CaMV.35S
  enh+Ph.DnaK:1:3 (SEQ ID NO: 42) in different ways depending upon the specific 3' UTR
  selected.  In many cases, there was an enhancement of expression in certain tissues of plants
  transformed with plant expression vectors comprising a Medicago 3' UTRs relative to plants
  transformed with pMON102167, which comprised a 3' UTR derived from Gossypium
  barbadense. However, the enhancement effect was not seen in all plant tissues and, in many
  cases, expression was attenuated in some tissues and enhanced in others using a Medicago 3'
  UTR. Thus, the use of selected Medicago 3' UTRs allows for one to "fine tune" the expression
  profile of a particular transgene and can be used in combination with different expression
  elements, such as promoters, leaders and introns, in operable linkage with a transcribable DNA

                                     Transformed Soybean Plants
[00100]           Soybean plants were transformed with vectors, specifically plasmid constructs, to
 assess the effect of selected Medicago 3' UTRs on expression. Specifically, soybean plants were
 transformed with DNA vectors containing a seed expressing EXP sequence driving expression of
 the B-glucuronidase (GUS) transgene operably linked to a Medicago 3' UTR. These Medicago
 3' UTR-transformed soybean plants were compared to transformed soybean plants in which
 expression of the GUS transgene was driven by a seed expressing EXP sequence and the GUS
 transgene was operably linked to 3' UTR derived from Gossypium barbadense.
[00101]           The plant vectors utilized in these experiments were built using cloning methods
 known in the art. The resulting vectors comprised a left border region from A. tumefaciens; a
 first transgene expression cassette for selection of transformed plant cells that confers resistance
 to the antibiotic spectinomycin (driven by the Arabidopsis Actin 7 promoter); a second transgene
 expression cassette used to assess the activity of the 3' UTR, which comprised the EXP element,
 EXP-Gm.Sphas1:1:1 (SEQ ID NO: 50), which provides seed preferred expression, operably
 linked 5' to a coding sequence for GUS that possesses a processable intron (GUS-2, SEQ ID
 NO: 44), which is operably linked 5' to a 3' UTR derived from Medicago truncatula or
 Gossypium barbadense; and a right border region from A. tumefaciens. The plant expression
 vectors that comprised a 3' UTR derived from Medicago were pMON116832, pMON116834,

 barbadensewas pMON83028.

[00104]           As can be seen in Tables 15 and 16, most of the Medicago 3' UTRs affected
 expression of the seed preferred EXP element, EXP-Gm.Sphas1:1:1 (SEQ ID NO: 50), in only
 seed-derived tissues, with the exception of T-Mt.Apx-1:1:2 (SEQ ID NO: 5), which enhanced
 expression of GUS in the RI Source Leaf, RI Petiole, and RI Flower.         Several Medicago 3'
 UTRs provided high expression in the Yellow Pod Embryo and Yellow Pod Cotyledon, such as
 T-Mt.AC145767v28-1:1:2 (SEQ ID NO: 1), T-Mt.RD22-1:2:1 (SEQ ID NO: 24), and T
 Mt.AC153125V10-1:2:1 (SEQ ID NO: 4).          Thus, these 3' UTRs may be ideal to enhance
 expression of a seed promoter during the later stages of seed development.      The 3' UTR T
 Mt.Exprl-1:2:1 (SEQ ID NO: 7) provided high expression in both R5 Cotyledon and Yellow
 Pod Cotyledon relative to many of the other 3' UTRs, and thus may be useful in providing high
 cotyledon expression for a wider window of seed development.       In some cases, the    3' UTR
 provided a more uniform level of seed expression both in the Yellow Pod Embryo and Yellow
 Pod Cotyledon, such as when T-Mt.FBA-1:2:1 (SEQ ID NO: 9), T-Mt.Zfp-1:2:1 (SEQ ID NO:
 30), T-Mt.Pip1-1:2:1 (SEQ ID NO: 18), and T-Mt.Pt2-1:2:2 (SEQ ID NO: 23) were used.

 ID NO: 6) were allowed to set seed and were planted for R 1 generation studies. Table 17 shows
 a comparison of the mean quantitative assay data for events comprising these R 1 generation
 plants comprising Medicago 3' UTRs and plants transformed with pMON83028,                  which
 comprised the 3' UTR T-Gb.E6-3b:1:1 (SEQ ID NO: 40) derived from Gossypium barbadense.

[00106]          As can be seen in Table 17, the Medicago 3' UTRs affected expression differently
 than T-Gb.E6-3b:1:1 in the embryo and cotyledon tissues. For example, T-Mt.Apx-1:1:2 (SEQ
 ID NO: 5) and T-Mt.Suil-1:1:2 (SEQ ID NO: 29) enhanced expression of the seed-preferred
 EXP element in the Yellow Pod Embryo, Yellow Pod Cotyledon, and R5 Cotyledon relative to
 T-Gb.E6-3b:1:1.     T-Mt.EFla-1:1:2 (SEQ ID NO: 6) enhanced expression in the Yellow Pod
 Embryo and Yellow Pod Cotyledon, but not in the R5 Cotyledon. T-Mt.Zfp- 1:2:1 (SEQ ID NO:
 30) reduced expression in the later developing Yellow Pod Embryo and Yellow Pod Cotyledon,
 but enhanced expression in the R5 Cotyledon.
[00107]          Thus, each of the different Medicago 3' UTRs affect expression differentially in
 the developing seed when in operable linkage with a seed preferred promoter. These differences
 in the effect on expression can be utilized to provide a more refined and tailored approach to
 seed expression and may be ideally suited for "fine tuning" the expression profile of specific
 transcribable DNA molecules where seed expression is desired.

[00108]          Soybean plants were transformed with vectors, specifically plasmid constructs, to
 assess the effect of selected Medicago truncatula 3' UTRs on expression. Specifically, soybean
 plants were transformed with vectors containing two different EXP elements that exhibit a
 constitutive expression profile driving expression of the B-glucuronidase (GUS) transgene
 operably linked to a Medicago 3' UTR.         These Medicago 3' UTR-transformed plants were

 compared to transformed soybean plants in which expression of the GUS transgene was operably
 linked to a 3' UTR derived from Gossypium barbadense.
[00109]           The plant vectors utilized in these experiments were built using cloning methods
 known in the art. The resulting vectors comprised a left border region from A. tumefaciens; a
 first transgene expression cassette for selection of transformed plant cells that confers resistance
 to the antibiotic spectinomycin (driven by the Arabidopsis Actin 7 promoter); a second transgene
 expression cassette used to assess the activity of the 3' UTR, which comprised the EXP elements
 EXP-CaMV.35S-enh+Ph.DnaK:1:3 (SEQ ID NO: 42) or EXP-DaMV.FLT:1:2 (SEQ ID NO: 51)
 operably linked 5' to a coding sequence for GUS that possesses a processable intron (GUS-2,
 SEQ ID NO: 44), which is operably linked 5' to a 3' UTR derived from Medicago truncatula or
 Gossypium barbadense; and a right border region from A. tumefaciens.                The vectors that
 comprised a 3' UTR derived from Medicago were pMON118768,                        pMON153701      and
 pMON116803.         The vectors that comprised a 3' UTR from Gossypium barbadense were
 pMON121042 and pMON102167.

 constitutive EXP element EXP-DaMV.FLT: 1:2 (SEQ ID NO: 51) differently than the Gossypium
 barbadense-derived3' UTR T-Gb.E6-3b:1:1 (SEQ ID NO: 40). In many of the sampled tissues,
 there was an enhancement of expression using the Medicago 3' UTRs. With respect to the 3'
 UTR T-Mt.AC140914v20-1:2:1, enhancement was seen in most tissues in plants also comprising
 the EXP element EXP-CaMV.35S-enh+Ph.DnaK:1:3 (SEQ ID NO: 42). Tables 21 and 22 show
 the fold differences of the quantitative GUS expression relative to the expression imparted by
 pMON121042 (T-Gb.E6-3b:1:1 (SEQ ID NO: 40)), which comprises a 3' UTR derived from
 Gossypium barbadense.

[00113]           The forgoing experiments demonstrate that each of the Medicago 3' UTRs has
 different effects upon the level of expression of each of the constitutive EXP elements relative to
 pMON121042 (T-Gb.E6-3b:1:1 (SEQ ID NO: 40)), which comprises the 3' UTR derived from
 Gossypium barbadense. For example, expression of EXP-DaMV.FLT:1:2 was enhanced 1.14
 to 15.13-fold in Vn5 Root, Vn5 Sink Leaf, Vn5 Source Leaf, RI Source Leaf, RI Petiole, RI
 Flower, Yellow Pod Embryo, Yellow Pod Cotyledon, R3 Pod, and R5 Cotyledon, but reduced in
 the R3 Immature Seed using T-Mt.Sali3-2-1:2:1. This same EXP element, when combined with
 T-Mt.AC140914v20-1:2:1, resulted in a 1.34- to 13.42-fold enhancement in Vn5 Root, Vn5
 Source Leaf, RI Source Leaf, RI Petiole, RI Flower, Yellow Pod Embryo, Yellow Pod
 Cotyledon, R3 Immature Seed, R3 Pod, and R5 Cotyledon, but remained about the same as T
 Gb.E6-3b:1:1 (SEQ ID NO: 40) in the V5 Sink Leaf. Expression in Yellow Pod Embryo was
 about twice that of Yellow Pod Cotyledon using T-Mt.Sali3-2-1:2:1 (15.13- vs. 7.23-fold
 enhancement), while expression in these two tissues was relatively the same when using T
 Mt.AC140914v20-1:2:1 (9.19- vs. 9.13-fold enhancement).         With respect to the EXP element
 EXP-CaMV.35S-enh+Ph.DnaK:1:3, combination with T-Mt.AC140914v20-1:2:1 produced less
 enhancement in many of the sampled tissues than when this same 3' UTR was combined with
 EXP-DaMV.FLT:1:2. In RI Flower, there was a reduction of expression relative to T-Gb.E6
 3b: 1:1 when EXP-CaMV.35S-enh+Ph.DnaK: 1:3 was combined with T-Mt.AC140914v20-1:2:1.
 The combination of EXP-CaMV.35S-enh+Ph.DnaK:1:3                with T-Mt.Sali3-2-1:2:1   provided
 enhancement in Vn5 Root, Vn5 Sink Leaf, Vn5 Source Leaf, RI Source Leaf, Yellow Pod
 Embryo, and Yellow Pod Cotyledon, but reduced expression in the RI Flower and R5 Cotyledon
 relative to T-Gb.E6-3b:1:1 (SEQ ID NO: 40).
[00114]           Each of the two Medicago 3' UTRs, T-Mt.Sali3-2-1:2:1 and T-Mt.AC140914v20
 1:2:1,   affected the expression of the two different constitutive          EXP elements,    EXP
 DaMV.FLT:1:2 and EXP-CaMV.35S-enh+Ph.DnaK:1:3, differently. In many tissues, there was
 an enhancement of expression relative to T-Gb.E6-3b: 1:1 (SEQ ID NO: 40), but in some tissues,
 a reduction of expression occurred. Thus, by using different Medicago 3' UTRs, one may be
 able to more precisely control expression in the plant and better "fine tune" the expression of
 specific transcribable DNA molecules to provide optimal expression where the expression of the

 transcribable DNA molecule is required, while reducing expression in tissues that might
 negatively affect the plant.

[00115]          Soybean plants were transformed with vectors, specifically plasmid constructs, to
 assess the effect of the Medicago 3' UTR T-Mt.AC145767v28-1:1:2 (SEQ ID NO: 1) on
 expression. Specifically, the soybean plants were transformed with vectors containing several
 different EXPs with a constitutive expression profile driving expression of the B-glucuronidase
 (GUS) transgene operably linked to the Medicago 3' UTR T-Mt.AC145767v28-1:1:2 (SEQ ID
 NO: 1). These Medicago 3' UTR- transformed soybean plants were compared to transformed
 soybean plants in which the GUS transgene was operably linked to a 3' UTR derived from
 Gossypium barbadense.
[00116]          The vectors utilized in these experiments were built using cloning methods known
 in the art.   The resulting vectors comprised a left border region from A. tumefaciens; a first
 transgene expression cassette for selection of transformed plant cells that confers resistance to
 the antibiotic spectinomycin (driven by the Arabidopsis Actin 7 promoter); a second transgene
 expression cassette used to assess the activity of the 3' UTR T-Mt.AC145767v28-1:1:2 (SEQ ID

[00119]         As    demonstrated   in   Tables  24   and  25,  the   Medicago 3'    UTR    T
 Mt.AC145767v28-1:1:2 (SEQ ID NO: 1) boosted expression of the six constitutive EXP
 elements relative to T-Gb.E6-3b: 1:1 (SEQ ID NO: 40), but in different ways depending upon the
 specific EXP element and tissue. The EXP element, EXP-Mt.AC145767v28:1:1, when used to
 drive GUS and operably linked to its native 3' UTR T-Mt.AC145767v28-1:1:2 expressed very
 low in all of the tissues assayed and was undetectable in R3 Immature Seed, R3 Pod, and RI
 Flower. Some tissues of plants comprising the EXP element EXP-Mt.Ubq2:1:2 and the 3' UTR
 T-Mt.AC145767v28-1:1:2 demonstrated reduced expression relative to the combination of EXP
 Mt.Ubq2:1:2 and T-Gb.FbL2-1:1:1. This reduced expression was seen in R3 Immature Seed, RI
 Flower, and RI Petiole while, in contrast, Vn5 Sink Leaf and R5 Cotyledon expression was
 enhanced greater than four-fold. There was no change in root expression (Vn5 Root) with EXP
 Mt.Ubq2:1:2 and either 3' UTR.
[00120]         The regulatory expression element groups EXP-CERV.FLT:1:2 and EXP
 DaMV.FLT: 1:2 provided the highest levels of expression. As demonstrated in Tables 26 and 27,
 these two EXPs were enhanced in all tissues with T-Mt.AC145767v28-1:1:2 relative to the same
 EXPs combined with T-Gb.E6-3b:1:1(SEQ ID NO: 40).           The regulatory expression element
 group EXP-CERV.FLT:1:2 was enhanced 60.50-fold in the developing Yellow Pod Cotyledon
 and less so in the Yellow Pod Embryo (21.50-fold), while the regulatory expression element
 group EXP-DaMV.FLT: 1:2 was enhanced to a greater degree in the Yellow Pod Embryo than in
 the Yellow Pod Cotyledon (26.80- vs. 15.76-fold enhancement, respectively). These expression
 and enhancement differences offer an opportunity to provide tailored expression of a transgene
 in the later stage developing      seed.    The regulatory expression element group EXP
 BSAcVNV.FLT:1:2 expressed highest in the R3 Pod and Vn5 Root when combined with T
 Gb.E6-3b:1:1 (see Tables 25 and 26). The expression of EXP-BSAcVNV.FLT:1:2 in these two
 tissues was enhanced dramatically when combined with T-Mt.AC145767v28-1:1:2, particularly
 in Vn5 Root. Further, the expression of EXP-BSAcVNV.FLT:1:2 was boosted 58.63-fold when
 combined with T-Mt.AC145767v28-1:1:2 relative to this same EXP combined with T-Gb.E6
 3b:1:19 (SEQ ID NO: 40)
[00121]         In sum, the Medicago truncatula 3' UTR T-Mt.AC145767v28-1:1:2 (SEQ ID
 NO: 1) enhanced expression of six different constitutive EXP elements which were derived from
                                                 60

 both plant and plant viral genomic DNA. In addition, this 3' UTR enhanced expression of the
 seed-preferred EXP element EXP-Gm.Sphas 1:1:1 (SEQ ID NO: 54) relative to most of the other
Medicago-derived 3' UTRs.           Accordingly, this 3' UTR is suited for providing enhanced
 expression of a promoter or combination of operably linked expression elements in a construct.

    Analysis of EXP-Mt.Ubq2:1:2 (SEQ ID NO: 31) in Stably Transformed Soybean Plants
[00122]           Soybean plants were transformed with vectors, specifically plasmid constructs,
 comprising the constitutive regulatory expression element group EXP-Mt.Ubq2:1:2 (SEQ ID
 NO: 31) operably linked to a GUS coding sequence.            These transformed plants were then
 assayed for GUS expression in stably transformed soybean plants.
[00123]           The plant vectors utilized in these experiments were built using cloning methods
 known in the art. The resulting vectors comprised a left border region from A. tumefaciens; a
 first transgene expression cassette for selection of transformed plant cells that confers resistance
 to the antibiotic spectinomycin (driven by the Arabidopsis Actin 7 promoter); a second transgene
 expression cassette used to assess the activity of EXP-Mt.Ubq2:1:2 (SEQ ID NO: 31) which
 comprised EXP-Mt.Ubq2:1:2 operably linked 5' to a coding sequence for B-glucuronidase
 (GUS) that possesses a processable intron (GUS-2, SEQ ID NO: 44) operably linked 5' to the 3'
 UTR T-Mt.AC145767v28-1:1:2 (SEQ ID NO: 1) derived from Medicago truncatula, or the 3'
 UTRs T-Gb.E6-3b:1:1 (SEQ ID NO: 40) or T-Gb.FbL2-1:1:1 (SEQ ID NO: 41) derived from
 Gossypium barbadense;and a right border region from A. tumefaciens.
[00124]           The resulting vectors were used to transform soybean plants as described in
 Example 3. Tables 28 and 29 show the average quantitative GUS expression values assayed in
 various tissues and developmental time points for the stably transformed soybean plants.

[00125]         As demonstrated in Tables 28 and 29, EXP-Mt.Ubq2:1:2 (SEQ ID NO: 31) is able
to drive constitutive expression of a transcribable DNA molecule in stably transformed soybean
plants. Further, different 3' UTRs affect the degree of expression in each tissue. For example,
combining EXP-Mt.Ubq2:1:2 with T-Gb.E6-3b:1:1 resulted in lower expression in all of the
tissues assayed than the other two 3' UTRs, T-Gb.FbL2-1:1:1 and T-Mt.AC145767v28-1:1:2.
However, regardless of which 3' UTR was applied, EXP-Mt.Ubq2:1:2 provides medium-to-high
constitutive expression, the degree of which can be modulated by a selection of which 3' UTR is
operably linked to the EXP.

                       Enhancers Derived from the Regulatory Elements
[00126]         Enhancers may be derived from the promoter elements provided herein, such as
SEQ ID NOs: 32 and 36. An enhancer element may be comprised of one or more cis-regulatory
elements that, when operably linked 5' or 3' to a promoter element, or operably linked 5' or 3' to
additional enhancer elements that are operably linked to a promoter, can enhance or modulate
expression of a transcribable DNA molecule, or provide expression of a transcribable DNA
molecule in a specific cell type or plant organ or at a particular time point in development or
circadian rhythm.     Enhancers are made by removing the TATA box or functionally similar
elements and any downstream sequence that allow transcription to be initiated from the
promoters or promoter fragments.
[00127]         Enhancer elements may be derived from the promoter elements provided herein
and cloned using methods known in the art to be operably linked 5' or 3' to a promoter element,
or operably linked 5' or 3' to additional enhancer elements that are operably linked to a

 promoter. Alternatively, enhancer elements maybe cloned, using methods known in the art, to be
 operably linked to one or more copies of the enhancer element which are operably linked 5' or 3'
 to a promoter element, or operably linked 5' or 3' to additional enhancer elements that are
 operably linked to a promoter. Further, enhancer elements can be cloned to be operably linked
 5' or 3' to a promoter element derived from a different genus organism, or operably linked 5' or
 3' to additional enhancer elements derived from other genus organisms or the same genus
 organism that are operably linked to a promoter derived from either the same or different genus
 organism, resulting in a chimeric regulatory element. A GUS expression plant transformation
 vector maybe constructed using methods known in the art similar to the constructs described in
 the previous Examples in which the resulting plant expression vectors contain a left border
 region from A. tumefaciens; a first transgene selection cassette that confers resistance to an
 antibiotic or herbicide and is utilized for selection of transformed plant cells; and a second
 transgene cassette in which an enhancer element is operably linked to a promoter forming a
 chimeric promoter element, which is operably linked 5' to a leader element, which is operably
 linked 5' to a coding sequence for GUS that possesses a processable intron (GUS-2, SEQ ID
 NO: 44), operably linked to a 3' UTR such as T-Gb.E6-3b: 1:1 or any of those described above
 from Medicago truncatula;and a right border region from A. tumefaciens.
[00128]          GUS expression driven by a regulatory element comprising one or more
 enhancers maybe evaluated in stable or transient plant assays as described herein to determine
 the effects of the enhancer element on expression of a transcribable DNA               molecule.
 Modifications to one or more enhancer elements or duplication of one or more enhancer
 elements maybe performed based upon empirical experimentation, and the resulting gene

 relative positions of one or more enhancers in the resulting regulatory or chimeric regulatory

  Analysis of the Effect of 3' UTRs on Constitutive GUS Expression in Stably Transformed
                                             Corn Plants
[00129]          Corn plants were transformed with binary plasmid constructs to assess the effect
 of the Medicago 3' UTR T-Mt.Oxr-1:2:1 (SEQ ID NO: 17) on expression relative to two 3'
 UTRs used frequently in corn plants. Specifically, the corn plants were transformed with vectors
 containing an EXP that exhibited a constitutive expression profile driving expression of the B
 glucuronidase (GUS) transgene, which was operably linked to the Medicago 3' UTR T-Mt.Oxr
 1:2:1 (SEQ ID NO: 17).       These transformed corn plants were compared to transformed corn
 plants in which GUS was operably linked to either the 3' UTR T-AGRtu.nos-1:1:13 (SEQ ID
 NO: 49) or the 3' UTR T-Os.LTP:1 (SEQ ID NO: 56).
[00130]          The binary plasmid constructs utilized in these experiments were built using
 cloning methods known in the art. The resulting vectors contained a right border region from A.
 tumefaciens; a first expression cassette to assay the 3' UTR sequence wherein a constitutive
 regulatory expression element group EXP-FMV.35S-enh+Ta.Lhcbl+Zm.DnaK:1:2 (SEQ ID
 NO: 56) is operably linked 5' to a coding sequence for GUS that possesses a processable intron
 (GUS-2, SEQ ID NO: 44), which is operably linked 5' to one of the following three 3' UTRs: T
 Mt.Oxr-1:2:1 (SEQ ID NO: 17), T-AGRtu.nos-1:1:13 (SEQ ID NO: 49) or T-Os.LTP:1 (SEQ ID
 NO: 56); a second transgene expression cassette used for selection of transformed plant cells that
 confers resistance to the herbicide glyphosate (driven by the rice Actin 1 promoter); and a left
 border region from A. tumefaciens. The resulting plasmids were used to transform corn plants.
[00131]          Histochemical GUS analysis was used for qualitative expression analysis of the
 transformed plants. Whole tissue sections were incubated with GUS staining solution X-Gluc
 (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-glucuronide) (1 mg/ml) for an appropriate length of time, rinsed,
 and visually inspected for blue coloration. GUS activity was qualitatively determined by direct
 visual inspection or inspection under a microscope using selected plant organs and tissues. The
 Ro plants were inspected for expression in the roots and leaves, as well as the anther, silk, and
 developing seed and embryo, 21 days after pollination (21 DAP).
[00132]          Quantitative analysis for the transformed corn plants was also performed. For the
 quantitative analysis, total protein was extracted from selected tissues of the transformed corn
 plants.    One microgram of total protein was used with the fluorogenic              substrate 4

example, the 3' UTR T-Os.LTP:1 (SEQ ID NO: 56) appeared to enhance expression in the VT
Root and RI Cob/Silk relative to the other two 3' UTRs. The 3' UTR T-Mt.Oxr-1:2:1 (SEQ ID

21DAP Embryo relative to T-AGRtu.nos-1:1:13 (SEQ ID NO: 49) and T-Os.LTP:1 (SEQ ID

 UTRs demonstrates the usefulness of each 3' UTR in modulating expression.             Thus, these
 experiments demonstrate that the selection of a 3' UTR can be used in transgene cassettes to fine
 tune expression of a particular transcribable DNA molecule. This experiment also demonstrates
 the ability of a dicot-derived 3' UTR, such as T-Mt.Oxr-1:2:1, to affect transcription in a
 monocot species such as corn.

           Analysis of Intron Enhancement of GUS Activity Using Plant Derived Protoplasts
[00135]          Generally, an intron is selected based upon experimentation and comparison with
 an intronless vector control to empirically select an intron and configuration within the vector
 transfer DNA (T-DNA) element arrangement for optimal expression of a transgene.                For
 example, in the expression of an herbicide resistance gene, such as CP4 (US RE39247), which
 confers tolerance to glyphosate, it is desirable to have transgene expression within the
 reproductive tissues as well as the vegetative tissues in order to prevent the loss of yield when
 applying the herbicide.     An intron in this instance would be selected upon its ability, when
 operably linked to a constitutive promoter, to enhance expression of the herbicide resistance
 conferring transgene, particularly within the reproductive cells and tissues of the transgenic
 plant, and thus providing both vegetative and reproductive tolerance to the transgenic plant when
 sprayed with the herbicide. In most ubiquitin genes, the 5' UTR is comprised of a leader, which
 has an intron sequence embedded within it. The regulatory elements derived from such genes
 are therefore assayed using the entire 5' UTR comprising the promoter, leader, and intron. To
 achieve different expression profiles or to modulate the level of transgene expression, the intron
 from such a regulatory element may be removed or substituted with a heterologous intron.
[00136]          The intron presented herein as SEQ ID NO: 34 was identified using genomic
 DNA contigs in comparison to expressed sequence tag clusters, or cDNA contigs, to identify
 exon and intron sequences within the genomic DNA.        In addition, 5' UTR or leader sequences
 were also used to define the intron/exon splice junction of one or more introns under conditions
 when the gene sequence encodes a leader sequence that is interrupted by one or more introns.
 Introns were cloned using methods known in the art into a plant transformation vector to be
 operably linked 3' to a regulatory element and leader fragment and operably linked 5' to either a
                                                   66

       WO 2014/159434                                                        PCT/US2014/023648
 second leader fragment or to coding sequences, such as the expression cassettes presented in
 FIG. 1.
[00137]           Thus, for example, a first possible expression cassette, such as Expression
 Cassette Configuration 1 in FIG. 1, is comprised of a promoter or chimeric promoter element
 [A], operably linked 5' to a leader element [B], operably linked 5' to a test intron element [C],
 operably linked to a coding region [D], which is operably linked to a 3' UTR element [E].
 Alternatively, a second possible expression cassette, such as Expression Cassette Configuration 2
 in FIG. 1, is comprised of a promoter or chimeric promoter element [F], operably linked 5' to a
 first leader element or first leader element fragment [G], operably linked 5' to a test intron
 element [H], operably linked 5' to a second leader element or first leader element second
 fragment [I], operably linked to a coding region [J], which is operably linked to a 3' UTR
 element [K].       Further, a third possible expression cassette, such as Expression Cassette
 Configuration 3 in FIG. 1, is comprised of a promoter or chimeric promoter element [L],
 operably linked 5' to a leader element [M], operably linked 5' to a first fragment of the coding
 sequence element [N], operably linked 5' to an intron element [0] element, operably linked 5' to
 a second fragment of the coding sequence element [P], which is operably linked to a 3' UTR
 element [Q]. Notably, Expression Cassette Configuration 3 is designed to allow splicing of the
 intron in such a manner as to produce a complete open reading frame without a frame shift
 between the first and second fragment of the coding sequence.
[00138]           As discussed herein, it may be preferable to avoid using the nucleotide sequence
 AT or the nucleotide A just prior to the 5' end of the splice site (GT) and the nucleotide G or the
 nucleotide sequence TG, respectively just after 3' end of the splice site (AG) to eliminate the
 potential of unwanted start codons from being formed during processing of the messenger RNA
 into the final transcript. The DNA sequence around the 5' or 3' end splice junction sites of the
 intron can thus be modified.
[00139]           Introns may be assayed for an enhancement effect through the ability to enhance
 expression in transient assay or stable plant assay. For transient assay of intron enhancement, a
 base plant vector is constructed using methods known in the art. The intron is cloned into a base
 plant vector which comprises an expression cassette comprised of a constitutive EXP comprised
 of a promoter and leader such as         EXP-CaMV.35S-enh+Ph.DnaK:1:3          (SEQ ID NO: 42),
 operably linked 5' to a test intron element (e.g. one SEQ ID NO: 34), operably linked to a coding

 sequence for GUS that possesses a processable intron (GUS-2, SEQ ID NO: 44), operably linked
 to the 3' UTR from (T-Gb.E6-3b:1:1, SEQ ID NO: 40). Protoplast cells derived from soybean or
 other genus plant tissue can be transformed with the base plant vector and Luciferase control
 vectors as described previously in Example 2 above, and assayed for activity. To compare the
 relative ability of the intron to enhance expression, GUS values are expressed as a ratio of GUS
 to Luciferase activity and compared with those levels imparted by a construct comprising the
 constitutive promoter operably linked to a known intron standard such as that as the intron
 derived from the Nicotiana tabacum elongation factor 4A 10 gene, I-Nt.eIF4A 10-1:1:1 (SEQ ID
 NO: 57), as well as a construct comprising the constitutive promoter, but without an intron
 operably linked to the promoter.
[00140]           For stable plant assay of the intron presented as SEQ ID NO: 34, a GUS
 expression plant transformation vector can be constructed similar to the constructs described in
 the previous examples in which the resulting plant expression vectors contains a right border
 region from A. tumefaciens; a first expression cassette comprised of a constitutive EXP
 comprised of a promoter and leader such as EXP-CaMV.35S-enh+Ph.DnaK:1:3 (SEQ ID NO:
 42), operably linked 5' to a test intron element (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 34), operably linked to a
 coding sequence for GUS that possesses a processable intron (GUS-2, SEQ ID NO: 44),
 operably linked to the 3' UTR from Gossypium barbadense (T-Gb.E6-3b:1:1, SEQ ID NO: 40).
 Protoplast cells derived from corn or other genus plant tissue may be transformed with the base
 plant vector and luciferase control vectors, as described previously in Example 2 above, and
 assayed for activity. To compare the relative ability of the intron to enhance expression, GUS
 values are expressed as a ratio of GUS to luciferase activity and compared with those levels
 imparted by a construct comprising the constitutive promoter operably linked to a known intron
 standard such as that as the intron derived from the Nicotiana tabacum elongation factor 4A10
 gene, I-Nt.eIF4A1O-1:1:1 (SEQ ID NO: 57), as well as a construct comprising the constitutive
 promoter, but without an intron operably linked to the promoter.
[00141]           It should be noted that the intron presented as SEQ ID NO: 34 can be modified in
 a number of ways, such as deleting fragments within the intron sequence, which may reduce
 expression or duplication of fragments with the intron that may enhance expression. In addition,
 DNA sequences within the intron that may affect the specificity of expression to either particular
 cells types or tissues and organs can be duplicated or altered or deleted to affect expression and

patterns of expression of the transgene. In addition, the intron provided herein can be modified
to remove any potential start codons (ATG) that may cause unintentional transcripts from being
expressed from improperly spliced introns as different, longer or truncated proteins. Once the
intron has been empirically tested, or it has been altered based upon experimentation, the intron
may be used to enhance expression of a transgene in stably transformed plants that can be of any
genus monocot or dicot plant, so long as the intron provides enhancement of the transgene. The
intron can also be used to enhance expression in other organisms, such as algae, fungi, or animal
cells, so long as the intron provides enhancement or attenuation or specificity of expression of
the transgene to which it is operably linked.
