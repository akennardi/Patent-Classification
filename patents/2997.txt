   Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments of the Invention
   The present disclosure is directed generally to fiber optic devices in the form of fiber optic
   cassettes. As will be described in further detail below, the different embodiments of the
20 fiber optic cassettes of the present disclosure are designed to relay multiple fibers which
   terminate at a rear connector, such as an MPO style connector, to a plurality of ferrules
   positioned at a generally front portion of the cassette.      The fiber optic cassettes of the
   present disclosure, thus, provide a transition housing or support between multi-fibered
   connectors, such as the MPO style connectors having MT ferrules, and single or dual fiber
25 connectors, such as LC or SC type connectors.
   As will be described in further detail below, the different embodiments of the fiber optic
   cassettes of the present disclosure utilize flexible optical circuits for the transition between
   the multi-fibered connectors positioned at one end of the cassette and the single or dual
30 connectors positioned at an opposite end of the cassette.
                                                   9

   Flexible optical circuits are passive optical components that comprise one or more
   (typically, multiple) optical fibers embedded on a flexible substrate, such as a MylarTM or
   other flexible polymer substrate. Commonly, although not necessarily, one end face of
   each fiber is disposed adjacent one longitudinal end of the flexible optical circuit substrate
 5 and the other end face of each fiber is disposed adjacent the opposite longitudinal end of
   the flexible optical circuit substrate. The fibers extend past the longitudinal ends of the
   flexible optical circuit (commonly referred to as pigtails) so that they can be terminated to
   optical connectors, which can be coupled to fiber optic cables or other fiber optic
   components through mating optical connectors.
10
   Flexible optical circuits essentially comprise one or more fibers sandwiched between two
   flexible sheets of material, such as MylarTM or another polymer.           An epoxy may be
   included between the two sheets in order to adhere them together. Alternately, depending
   on the sheet material and other factors, the two sheets may be heated above their melting
15 point to heat-weld them together with the fibers embedded between the two sheets.
   The use of flexible optical circuits within the fiber optic cassettes of the present disclosure
   provides a number of advantages, which will be discussed in further detail below. For
   example, the substrate of a flexible optical circuit is mechanically flexible, being able to
20 accommodate tolerance variations in different cassettes, such as between connector
   ferrules and the housings that form the cassettes. The flexibility of the optical circuits also
   allow for axial movement in the fibers to account for ferrule interface variation. Also, by
   providing a rigid substrate within which the fibers are positionally fixed, use of flexible
   optical circuits allows a designer to optimize the fiber bend radius limits and requirements
25 in configuring the cassettes, thus, achieving reduced dimensions of the cassettes. The bend
   radius of the fibers can thus be controlled to a minimum diameter. By utilizing optical
   fibers such as bend insensitive fibers (e.g., 8mm bend radius) in combination with a
   flexible substrate that fixes the fibers in a given orientation, allowing for controlled
   bending, small form cassettes may be produced in a predictable and automated manner.
30 Manual handling and positioning of the fibers within the cassettes may be reduced and
   eliminated through the use of flexible optical circuits.
                                                  10

   Now referring to FIGS. 1-24, a first embodiment of a fiber optic cassette 10 that utilizes a
   flexible optical circuit 12 is shown.     In the fiber optic cassette 10 of FIGS. 1-24, the
   flexible optical circuit 12 is depicted as transitioning optical fibers 14 between a
   conventional connector 16 (e.g., an MPO connector) at the rear 18 of the cassette 10 and a
 5 plurality of non-conventional connectors 20 at the opposite front end 22 of the cassette 10,
   wherein portions of a substrate 24 of the flexible optical circuit 12 are physically inserted
   into the non-conventional connectors 20.
   It should be noted that the term "non-conventional connector" may refer to a fiber optic
10 connector that is not of a conventional type such as an LC or SC connector and one that
   has generally not become a recognizable standard footprint for fiber optic connectivity in
   the industry.
   The elimination of conventional mating connectors inside the cassette 10 may significantly
15 reduce the overall cost by eliminating the skilled labor normally associated with
   terminating an optical fiber to a connector, including polishing the end face of the fiber
   and epoxying the fiber into the connector. It further allows the fiber optic interconnect
   device such as the optical cassette 10 to be made very thin.
20 Still referring to FIGS. 1-24, the cassette 10 includes a body 26 defining the front 22, the
   rear 18 and an interior 28. Body 26 further includes a top 30, a bottom 32, and sides 34,
   36.
   A signal entry location 38 may be provided by the MPO connector 16, which, in the
25 illustrated embodiment, is along the rear 18 of the cassette body 26. A pocket 40 seats the
   MPO connector 16 while flexible cantilever arms 42 may be provided for coupling a
   second mating MPO connector to the cassette 10 with a snap-fit interlock.               Non
   conventional connectors 20 are arranged linearly adjacent the front 22 of the cassette 10
   and positioned along a longitudinal axis A defined by the body 26.           In the depicted
30 embodiment of the cassette 10, the MPO connector 16 of the cassette 10 is positioned to
   extend parallel to the longitudinal axis A and generally perpendicular to ferrules 44 of the
   non-conventional connectors 20 at the front 22 of the cassette 10.
                                                  11

   In general, cassette 10 includes the top 30 and bottom 32 which are generally parallel to
   each other and define the major surfaces of cassette body 26. Sides 34, 36, front 22, and
   rear 18 generally define the minor sides of cassette body 26.         The cassette 10 can be
 5 oriented in any position, so that the top and bottom surfaces can be reversed, or positioned
   vertically, or at some other orientation.
   In the embodiment of the fiber optic cassette 10 shown in FIGS. 1-24, the non
   conventional connectors 20 that are positioned adjacent the front 22 of the cassette 10 each
10 define a hub 46 mounted over the ferrule 44. A cross-section of the interface is seen in
   FIG. 15 and 15A. Each ferrule 44 is configured to terminate one of the fibers 14 extending
   out from the flexible circuit 12, as shown in FIGS. 21-24.
   The non-conventional connectors 20 are placed within pockets 48 provided at a connection
15 block or array 50 located at the front 22 of the cassette 10. A split sleeve 52 is also
   provided for ferrule alignment between the hub 46 and ferrule 44 of each non-conventional
   connector 20 and the ferrule of another mating connector that enters the cassette 10 from
   the front 22.
20 The mating connectors entering the cassette 10 from the front 22 of the cassette 10 may be
   connected through fiber optic adapters that are mounted on the connection block 50. The
   cassette 10 of FIGS. 1-24 is shown without the rows of adapters at the front 22 of the
   cassette 10 that would allow conventional connectors such as LC connectors to be mated
   to the non-conventional connectors 20 located within the interior 28 of the cassette 10.
25 Such adapters or adapter blocks may be snap fit, ultrasonically welded, or otherwise
   attached to the rest of the cassette body 26. In the versions of the fiber optic cassettes 110,
   210 illustrated in FIGS. 25-36 and 40-42, respectively, the rows of fiber optic adapters 5
   are shown on the cassettes 110, 210.
30 In the illustrated embodiment of the cassette 10 of FIGS. 1-24, the adapters that would be
   used with the cassette 10 are sized to receive mating LC connectors.        SC connectors can
   also be used with appropriate sized adapters.
                                                 12

   The cassette 10 of FIGS. 1-24 can be sealed or can be openable, so as to allow repair, or
   cleaning of the inner hubs 46 and ferrules 44. In some cases, the adapter blocks can be
   snap fit to a rest of the body 26 for ease of assembly. Adapter blocks can also preferably
 5 be removed from a rest of the cassette 10 to allow for cleaning of the inner non
   conventional connector 20.       The flexible fiber optic circuit 12 allows the entire fiber
   bundle, including the MPO connector 16 to be able to be removed for cleaning or
   replacement.
10 Referring specifically now to FIGS. 13 and 16-24, fiber pigtails 14 extending out from a
   rear end 54 of the substrate 24 forming the flexible optical circuit 12 are ribbonized for
   termination to an MT ferrule 56 of the MPO connector 16. The fiber pigtails 14 extending
   out from a front end 58 of the substrate 24 are individually terminated to the ferrules 44 to
   be positioned at the front 22 of the cassette 10. As shown, the substrate 24 defines front
15 extensions 60 (one per fiber 14) each provided in a spaced apart configuration for
   providing some flexibility to the substrate 24. The individual fibers 14 are separated out
   from the ribbonized section at the rear 54 of the substrate 24 and are routed through the
   substrate 24 to the individual front extensions 60. Each ferrule hub 46 defines a notch or a
   cut-out 62 for receiving front portions 64 of the front extensions 60 of the substrate 24.
20
   Fiber pigtails 14 that extend from each of the front extensions 60 of the substrate 24 are
   illustrated in FIGS. 21-24 diagrammatically. Referring now to the diagrammatic views of
   FIGS. 21-24, according to one example embodiment, the fiber pigtails 14 extending from
   the substrate 24 may be defined by an optical fiber 66 that is made up of a fiber core
25 surrounded by a cladding layer. A portion 68 of the front extension 60 of the substrate 24
   forming the flexible optical circuit 12 is inserted into a cylindrical bore 70 extending
   through the center of the ferrule hub 46, while an exposed optical fiber 66 that is made up
   of the fiber core and the surrounding cladding (after the primary coating has been stripped)
   is inserted into the ferrule 44 (see FIG. 21). The cut-out 62 of the ferrule hub 46 receives
30 the portion 68 of the front extension 60 of the substrate 24 in stabilizing the termination.
                                                 13

   According to one example process step, by using a rigid substrate, when the fibers are
   being terminated to the ferrules 44, the ends of the fibers may be cleaved and ends of all of
   the ferrules 44 extending from the substrate 24 may be polished simultaneously.
 5 As shown in FIGS. 11-13, 15, and 15A, in addition to the inherent ability of the substrate
   24 of the flexible optical circuit 12 to provide a bias for the ferrules 44 of the non
   conventional connectors 20 at the front 22 of the cassette 10 for ferrule interface
   variations, other structures may be used to supplement the inherent bias of the flexible
   circuit 12. For example, in the depicted embodiment of the cassette 10, a spring clip 72 is
10 positioned within a pocket 74 in the cassette 10 and extends parallel to the longitudinal
   axis A of the cassette body 26.        In a conventional fiber optic connector, the ferrule
   assemblies normally include springs such that when they are mated in an adapter, the
   ferrules are pressed together against the bias of the spring. In the depicted cassette 10, the
   spring clip 72 may be positioned to abut rear ends 75 of the ferrule hubs 46 so as provide
15 some bias to the ferrules 44 when they are mating incoming connectors. The flexibility of
   the substrate 24 of the flexible optical circuit 12 allows the ferrules 44 of the non
   conventional connectors 20 to flex back and the spring clip 72 provides additional bias to
   force them forwardly. The spring clip 72 may be adhered to the portions of the cassette 10
   for rigidly fixing the spring clip 72 within the cassette 10.
20
   It should be noted that a structure such as the spring clip 72 can be used on any of the
   embodiments of the fiber optic cassettes described and illustrated in the present
   application.
25 Referring now to FIGS. 25-36, another embodiment of a fiber optic cassette 110 is
   illustrated. The fiber optic cassette 110, similar to the cassette 10 of FIGS. 1-24, utilizes a
   flexible fiber optic circuit 112 within the body 126 for relaying fibers 114.          In this
   embodiment, a multi-fiber connector 116 (in the form of an MPO connector) is oriented
   parallel to non-conventional connectors 120 that are at the front 122 of the cassette 110,
30 generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis A defined by the cassette 110. The multi
   fiber connector 116 is mounted to the cassette 110 via a multi-fiber adapter 111 seated
   within a pocket 140 at a rear 118 of the cassette 110.
                                                  14

   The flexible circuit 112 is configured to transition fibers 114 from the multi-fiber
   connector 116 at the rear 118 defining the signal entry location 138 to non-conventional
   connectors 120 at the front 122 of the cassette 110. The cassette 110 is shown to include
 5 multiple rows of adapters 5 in the form of an adapter block 115 at the front 122 of the
   cassette 110. Via the adapters 5, conventional connectors such as LC connectors may be
   mated with ferrules 144 of the non-conventional connectors 120 located at the front 122 of
   the cassette 110. The adapters 5 are arranged linearly and positioned along longitudinal
   axis A. In the illustrated embodiment, adapters 5 are sized to receive front LC connectors.
10 SC connectors can also be used with appropriate sized adapters.             In the illustrated
   embodiment, the adapters 5 are formed in a block construction 115 having a front end 117,
   and an opposite rear end 119.          Front end 115 includes a profile for receiving LC
   connectors.    At the rear end 119 of the adapter block 115, the ferrule assemblies of the
   non-conventional connectors 120 including the ferrule hubs 146 and the ferrules 144 are
15 seated in pockets 148 aligned with ports 121 of the adapters 5. For each connector pair, a
   split sleeve 152 is also provided for ferrule alignment between hub and ferrule of each
   non-conventional connector 120 and the ferrule of a conventional LC connector.
   As shown and as discussed previously, the adapter blocks 115 may be snap fit,
20 ultrasonically welded or otherwise attached to a rest of the cassette body 126 or formed as
   part of the body 126. A cover 127 may be used to cover an area behind blocks 115. In
   FIGS. 26-31, the cassette 110 has been shown without the cover 127 to illustrate the
   internal features of the cassette 110.
25 As in the first embodiment of the cassette 10, the cassette 110 of FIGS. 25-36 is
   configured such that it can be sealed or can be openable, so as to allow repair, or cleaning
   of the inner hub 146 and ferrule 144. In some cases, the adapter blocks 115 can be snap fit
   to a rest of the body 126 for ease of assembly. Adapter blocks 115 can also preferably be
   removed from a rest of the cassette 110 to allow for cleaning of the inner non-conventional
30 connector 120. The flexible fiber optic circuit 112 allows the entire fiber bundle, including
   the MPO connector 116 to be able to be removed for cleaning or replacement.
                                                  15

   The termination of the fiber pigtails 114 extending from a front 158 of the substrate 124 of
   the flexible circuit 112 is similar to the termination for the ferrule assemblies described
   above with respect to the cassette 10 of FIGS. 1-24. At the rear 154 of the substrate 124,
   as described previously, the fibers 114 are ribbonized for termination to an MT ferrule
 5 156.
   The substrate 124 includes extensions 160 at the front side 158. The extensions 160 define
   cut-outs 161 between each one. The cutouts 161 allow flexibility for the substrate 124 and
   essentially enable the ferrules 144 of the non-conventional connectors 120 to be generally
10 free   floating  structures    to   allow   for  movement     in  two   different   axes  (e.g.,
   upward/downward, front/back).
   Referring specifically to FIGS. 27, 28, 31, 33, and 36, the substrate 124 of the flexible
   optical circuit 112 is also illustrated with a bent portion 125 adjacent the rear pocket 140 of
15 the cassette 110. As discussed previously, one advantage of using a flexible substrate 124
   to anchor the fibers 114 is to allow limited controlled movement of the substrate 124 either
   to accommodate any tolerance variances between the internal components and the cassette
   body 126 or to accommodate any movement of the internal ferrules 144 during connection
   to incoming connectors.
20
   An example of a simple flexible optical circuit 312 having a substrate 324 that includes a
   design for controlled bending and allowing axial movement in the fibers 314 is illustrated
   in FIGS. 37-39. Either a U-bend or an S-bend 325 can be provided in the substrate 324 of
   the flexible optical circuit 312 for allowing axial movement for the fibers 314. With the
25 tolerances of connector ferrules and molded polymeric structures (such as the cassette
   body), there can be a significant build up of ferrule interface variation. By allowing the
   substrate 324 of the flexible circuit 312 to bend in a controlled way, these tolerances can
   be accommodated.
30 FIGS. 40-42 illustrate another embodiment of a fiber optic cassette 210 utilizing a flexible
   optical circuit 212, wherein the bend 225 is provided generally in the middle portion 227
   of the substrate 224 of the circuit 212. The substrate 224 of the cassette 210 of FIGS. 40
                                                   16

   42 provides similar advantages as the cassettes 10, 110 described in previous
   embodiments.
   As another example, FIGS. 43-45 illustrate a flexible circuit 412 including a substrate 424
 5 with a twist 425 in the ribbonized-fiber part of the substrate 424.         Such a design can
   accommodate a large variation in distance between connector interfaces. As shown in the
   embodiment of the flexible circuit 412 of FIGS. 43-45, the MPO connector at the rear end
   of the substrate may define a longitudinal axis that is perpendicular to those of the non
   conventional connectors at the front of the substrate 424. Thus, the fibers 14 extending
10 from the MPO connector may follow an "S" or "Z" shaped pathway before being
   terminated to the front connectors. In the depicted embodiment, the optical fibers 14 enter
   the substrate 424 in a side-by-side, non-overlapping configuration and branch out
   therefrom as they extend to the non-conventional connectors at the front of the substrate.
   The substrate 424 allows the fibers 14 to follow such a path while preserving any
15 minimum bend radius requirements.         In a different example embodiment that will be
   discussed below shown in FIGS. 51, 52, the fibers entering the substrate at the back may
   be oriented parallel to the portions exiting from the front of the substrate. In such an
   example, the fibers may enter from the rear of the substrate, again, in a non-overlapping
   configuration and may branch out to the different non-conventional connectors at the front
20 of the substrate, following minimum bend radius requirements.
   Referring now to FIGS. 46-50, an embodiment of a ferrule strip 500 is illustrated. One of
   the issues normally encountered in assembly of the cassettes (e.g., 10, 110, 210) utilizing
   non-conventional connectors (e.g., 20, 120) at one end of the adapter blocks (e.g., 115) is
25 the loading of the ferrule hubs (e.g., 46, 146) onto the flex circuit (e.g., 12, 112, 212) and
   handling of the ferrule hubs. According to one inventive method, the ferrules (e.g., 44,
   144) may be overmolded with a polymeric multi-ferrule strip 500 that forms a plurality of
   integral hubs 546. The multi-ferrule strip 500 can be molded to hold the ferrules 544 at the
   correct pitch for insertion into the pockets (e.g., 48, 148) of the cassettes (e.g., 10, 110,
30 210).
                                                 17

   Now referring generally to FIGS. 51-61, when using a flexible circuit that includes a
   plurality of fibers embedded therein, production yield may be a big issue, especially given
   that all of the individual fibers have to be separately terminated into individual ferrules at
   the front of the flexible optical circuit. If there is any damage to one of the terminations
 5 (e.g., either to a fiber or to a ceramic ferrule), the entire flexible circuit may become
   unusable.     The present disclosure contemplates methodologies for allowing individual
   retermination of the fibers if one of the optical fibers or ferrules fails.
   Referring specifically now to FIGS. 51-52, according to one embodiment methodology, a
10 looped length 613 of buffered fiber 614 may be stored within the cassette between the
   flexible substrate 624 and each of the non-conventional connectors 620.          If one of the
   terminations fails, a technician would be able to unloop the length 613 of fiber 614 and
   reterminate, saving the rest of the flexible circuit 612.
15 According to another methodology, as illustrated in FIGS. 53-61, instead of utilizing a
   single flexible substrate for all of the fibers relayed from the multi-fiber connector 716, a
   plurality of separate duplex substrates 724 can be used in a stacked arrangement. Each
   duplex stack can be mounted removably on the cassette and may be removed for repair or
   replacement if one of the terminations fails.
20
   As shown in FIGS. 53-61, according to one embodiment, there may be six duplex flex
   circuits 712 including six substrates 724, totaling the twelve fibers 714 coming from an
   MPO connector. In such an embodiment, all six of the substrates 724 may be provided by,
   for example, manufacturing three different shapes and then flipping the three differently
25 shaped substrates 180 degrees to provide the six needed duplex substrates 724 for the
   whole stack. As shown in FIGS. 53-55, the three different shapes would be configured
   such that, when stacked, front extensions 760 of the substrates 724 would be spaced apart
   to resemble the front extensions (e.g., 60, 160) of a single integral substrate (e.g., 24, 124,
   224) and to fit within the internal configuration of a given cassette.
30
   Referring now to FIGS. 54-61, since the portion of the fibers 714 that are to be terminated
   to the MT ferrule of an MPO connector have to be provided in a flat, ribbonized
                                                   18

   configuration for the termination and since the stacked flex circuits 712 have the fibers 714
   in a stepped configuration, a clamp structure 780 that acts as a fiber transition device may
   be used within the cassette 712.
 5 As shown in FIGS. 54-61, the clamp structure 780 may include an upper member 782 that
   is snap fit to a lower member 784 with cantilever arms 786 that have tapered tabs 788.
   Both the upper and the lower members 782, 784 of the clamp structure 780 provide a fiber
   channel/guide 790 that includes steps 792 for transitioning the fibers 714 from a stepped
   configuration to a flat configuration for terminating to the MT ferrule 756 of an MPO
10 connector 716. The clamp 780 is designed such that stacked flex fibers 714 are converted
   to a linear plane so they can be ribbonized while maintaining the minimum bend radius
   requirements of the fibers 714.     The upper and lower members 782, 784 of the clamp
   structure 780 removably snap together for both holding the stacked substrates 724 in
   position and for controlling the transition of the fibers 714 while supporting bend radius
15 limitations. If any of the flex substrates, the ferrules, or the fibers are damaged, the clamp
   structure 780 can be taken apart, removing the flex substrate 724 to be repaired or
   replaced.
   According to certain embodiments, any of the cassettes described above and illustrated
20 herein may have a length of 3 to 4 inches (parallel to the longitudinal direction A), a width
   of 2 to 3 inches (front to back), and a height of approximately       12 inch. More preferably,
   the length may be 3 to 3   12 inches, the width may be 2 to 2     12 inches, and the height may
   be  12 inch. The height can vary as needed, such as to accommodate different formats of
   adapters 5 or multiple rows of adapters 5.
25
   Referring now to FIGS. 62-66, another example method for terminating a fiber pigtail 814
   extending out from a front end 858 of a flex substrate 824 to a ferrule of a non
   conventional connector is illustrated. In the depicted embodiment, duplex flex circuits 812
   similar to flex circuits 712 discussed above are used to illustrate the example termination
30 method.     As shown in FIG. 62, such duplex circuits 812 are provided in a stacked
   arrangement when being placed into a cassette body. According to the embodiment shown
   in FIGS. 62-66, the pigtails 814 that are to be individually terminated to ferrules 844 are
                                                  19

   formed by stripping a portion of the flex substrate 824 (including a primary coating layer
   of the fiber) such that an optical fiber 866 formed from a combination of a fiber core and a
   cladding layer is left. In certain embodiments, the optical fiber 866 formed from the fiber
   core and the cladding layer may be 125 micron in cross-dimension. The primary coating
 5 layer that is stripped is generally around 250 micron in cross-dimension according to one
   embodiment. The optical fiber 866 extends from a portion 868 of a front extension 860 of
   the flex substrate 824 that is to be inserted into the ferrule hub 846. According to certain
   embodiments, portion 868 defines a generally square cross-sectional shape having side
   dimensions of .5mm each.        Thus, the square cross-sectional portion 868 is able to be
10 inserted into a cylindrical bore 870 extending through the center of a ferrule hub 846,
   which may be about .9mm in diameter (see FIGS. 63-66). The exposed optical fiber 866
   that is made up of the fiber core and the surrounding cladding (after the primary coating
   has been stripped) is inserted into the ferrule 844, as seen in FIGS. 64-66.
15 Now referring to FIGS. 67-73, an example of a cassette 810 that is configured for
   receiving stacked flex circuits such as the flex circuits 812 shown in FIGS. 62-66 is
   illustrated. The cassette 810 is similar in certain aspects to the cassettes 10, 110, and 210
   shown in previous embodiments.        However, the cassette 810 defines pockets 848 at the
   front end 822 of the cassette body that match the exterior shape of the ferrule hubs 846
20 (e.g., having hexagonal footprints), wherein the pockets 848 are configured to fully
   surround the ferrule hubs 846. The pockets 848 are formed from portions of the cassette
   body that are integrally formed with the adapter block 815 of the cassette 810. As shown,
   the adapter block 815 is removably inserted into the cassette body 826. The pockets 848,
   also having a hexagonal configuration, match the exterior shape of the ferrule hubs 846
25 and prevent rotation of the hubs therewithin. In this manner, the hubs are retained in a
   stable manner during termination, assembly, polishing, etc.
   Even though the ferrule hubs 846 and the matching pockets 848 have been illustrated with
   a hexagonal cross-section in the depicted embodiment, in other embodiments, the keying
30 mechanism can be provided using different cross-sectional shapes having flat portions
   (such as square, rectangular, etc.). For example, an embodiment of a ferrule usable with
                                                  20

   the cassettes of the present disclosure having squared ferrule hubs has been shown in
   FIGS. 53-57 and 60.
   As shown, the cassette body 826 defines pockets 840 for receiving a clamp structure 880
 5 (similar to the clamp structure 780 of FIGS. 56-61) and an MPO connector 816 that is
   terminated to the rear ends of the individual duplex flex substrates 824.
   Still referring to FIGS. 67-73, the embodiment of the cassette 810 used with the stacked
   duplex flex circuits 812 has been illustrated with further additional aspects that may be
10 used on the cassettes (e.g., 10, 110, 210) of the earlier embodiments. For example, in
   accordance with some aspects, certain types of adapters that form the adapter blocks at the
   fronts of the cassettes may be configured to collect physical layer information from one or
   more fiber optic connectors (e.g., LC connectors) received thereat.        Certain types of
   adapters may include a body configured to hold one or more media reading interfaces that
15 are configured to engage memory contacts on the fiber optic connectors. The one or more
   media reading interfaces may be positioned in each adapter body in different ways. In
   certain implementations, the adapter body may define slots extending between an exterior
   of the adapter body and an internal passage in which the ferrules of the connectors are
   received.    Certain types of media reading interfaces may include one or more contact
20 members that are positioned in such slots. A portion of each contact member may extend
   into a respective one of the passages to engage memory contacts on a fiber optic
   connector.
   In the depicted example of the cassette 810 of FIGS. 67-73, the contacts 801 that extend
25 into each of the adapter passages of the block 815 are on a removable structure. The
   contacts 801 are defined on a printed circuit board 803 that is placed between the flexible
   circuits 812 and the cover 827 of the cassette 810. The contacts 801 align with the top
   sides of the adapter passages and extend into the adapter passages so as to engage memory
   contacts of fiber optic connectors inserted into the adapter passages. The printed circuit
30 board 803 is designed to relay the electrical signals from the contacts 801 at the front of
   the cassette 810 to the rear of the cassette 810 as shown in FIGS. 67-73. A conductive
   path may be defined by the printed circuit board 803 between the contacts 801 of the
                                                 21

   adapters at the front end with a master circuit board. The master circuit board may include
   or connect (e.g., over a network) to a processing unit that is configured to manage physical
   layer information obtained by the media reading interfaces. FIG. 73 illustrates a fiber
   optic connector making electrical contact with the media reading interfaces 801 of the
 5 printed circuit board 803 of the cassette 810.
   Example adapters having media reading interfaces and example fiber optic connectors
   having suitable memory storage and memory contacts are shown in U.S. Application No.
   13/025,841, filed February 11, 2011, titled "Managed Fiber Connectivity Systems," the
10 disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
   In addition to the various uses and applications of the described cassettes, the cassettes can
   be used to terminate the fibers of a multi-fiber FOT cable, such as a 144-fiber cable, to
   make installation of the terminated cables easier and faster.
15
   One advantage of the disclosed cassettes is that handling in the field of individual
   connectors, MPO connectors, or fanouts with upjackets are eliminated. The dimensions of
   the cassettes 10, 110, 210, 810 may be reduced by using flexible substrates (e.g., 24, 124,
   224, 824) that allow optimization of the bend radius limits of the fibers by fixing the fibers
20 in a given footprint or pattern. Also, manual handling and termination of individual fibers
   within the cassettes is reduced or eliminated, wherein automated, repeatable terminations
   may be provided within the cassettes.
   The cassettes described and illustrated herein may be used by being mounted to different
25 types of telecommunications fixtures.      The cassettes of the present disclosure may be
   fixedly mounted or mounted, for example, as part of slidably movable modules or packs.
   The example cassettes disclosed herein are further described in U.S. Patent Application
   Serial No. 61/707,323, Attorney Docket No. 02316.3554USP1, filed on even date herewith
30 and entitled "Fiber Optic Cassette." These cassettes can be manufactured using one or
   more of the apparatuses and processes described below.
                                                  22

   Referring now to FIGS. 74-76, an example double flexible optical circuit 910 is shown.
   The double flexible optical circuit 910 includes two flexible optical circuits 922, 924
   (similar to fiber optic circuit 112 described above) joined together at a juncture or dividing
   line 920. Specifically, MPO connectors 912, 914 are connected by pigtails 916, 918
 5 positioned in separate extensions 919 of the flexible optical circuits 922, 924.
   In this "double" configuration, the double flexible optical circuit 910 acts as a patch cord
   for purposes of testing the double flexible optical circuit 910. Each of the MPO connectors
   912, 914 can be connected to testing equipment, and the connectors and optical fibers in
10 the double flexible optical circuit 910 can be tested for such attributes as geometry and
   attenuation.
   Once testing of the double flexible optical circuit 910 is complete, the double flexible
   optical circuit 910 is cleaved at the junction 920 to form the two separate flexible optical
15 circuits 922, 924. At this point, each of the flexible optical circuits 922, 924 can be
   terminated and further processed as described herein.
   Referring now to FIGS. 77-82, an example fixture 930 for polishing the ferrules of the
   MPO connectors 912, 914 of multiple double flexible optical circuits 910 is shown. In this
20 example, the fixture 930 is a fixture such as that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 7,738,760
   entitled "Optical Polishing Fixture," the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by
   reference.
   In this example, the fixture 930 is modified to hold the double flexible optical circuits 910
25 during polishing. A central member 934 is connected to a base 932 such as that disclosed
   in U.S. Patent No. 7,738,760. The central member 934 is configured to interface with a
   plurality of holder members 936. Each holder member 936 holds one double flexible
   optical circuit 910 during polishing.
30 Specifically, the holder member 936 includes a curved body 940 sized to hold the double
   flexible optical circuit 910 in a folded configuration. The double flexible optical circuit
   910 is folded along a mid-line 921 (see FIG. 74) to form a generally U-shaped
                                                 23

   configuration so that a plurality of double flexible optical circuits 910 can be loaded onto
   the base 932. The holder member 936 includes a termination member 938 sized to hold the
   MPO connector 912, 914 opposite to the MPO connector 912, 914 being polished.
 5 In this configuration, multiple holder members 936, each holding one double flexible
   optical circuit 910, are loaded into the fixture 930 for polishing. When polishing of the
   ferrules in one of the MPO connectors 912, 914 is complete, the double flexible optical
   circuits 910 can be flipped to allow the other MPO connectors 912, 914 to be polished.
10 The fixture 930 is advantageous in that multiple double flexible optical circuits 910 can be
   polished using a standard polishing fixture. This results in increased compatibility with
   current polishing practices and enhances the speed at which the double flexible optical
   circuits 910 can be polished.
15 Referring now to FIGS. 83-94, example apparatuses and processes are shown for polishing
   the connectors to be positioned at the front of the cassette. In these examples, ferrules
   associated with the connectors are polished to optimize connections with the connectors.
   In FIGS. 83-88, an example fixture 950 is shown. The fixture 950 includes two sub
20 fixtures 952, 954 that are connected to a base 956. In this example, the base 956 is similar
   to that disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0182015, entitled
   "Polisher," the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
   Each of the sub-fixtures 952, 954 holds one flexible optical circuit 922. The sub-fixture
   952 includes a main body 958 that can be used to terminate the flexible optical circuit 922.
25 Specifically, the flexible optical circuit 922 is terminated using the sub-fixture 952 as
   follows.
   An example method 951 for terminating the flexible optical circuit 922 is shown in FIG.
   89. Initially, ferrules 970 are positioned in holes 966 formed in the main body 958
30 (operation 953). An epoxy is positioned within each of the ferrules 970 (operation 955). A
   clamp member 972 is then affixed to the main body 958 using screws 974. The clamp
   member 972 includes grooves 976 formed to correspond to each of the ferrules 970 so that,
                                                 24

   when the clamp member 972 is attached to the main body 958, the clamp member 972
   holds the ferrules 970 in place.
   Next, the flexible optical circuit 922 is positioned within the main body 958 (operation
 5 957). Bumpers 962 on the main body 958 form channels 964 so that each of the fibers and
   associated foil (i.e., the extensions 919) are directed properly towards the respective ferrule
   970 in the main body 958. The fibers are fed through the ferrules 970 (operation 959), and
   the epoxy is cured in an oven (operation 961), thereby affixing the fibers within the
   ferrules. In addition, the MPO connector 912 is positioned in a termination member 960
10 sized to hold the MPO connector 912 at an appropriate distance from the free ends of the
   fibers.
   Once the flexible optical circuit 922 has been terminated, the fibers are cleaved (operation
   963), and the ferrules are ready to be polished. During polishing (operation 965), the two
15 sub-fixtures 952, 954 are coupled back-to-back to the base 956 using bolts 982 that extend
   through holes 980 formed in each of the sub-fixtures 952, 954. See FIGS. 86-88. In this
   configuration, the X and Y axes for the ferrules 970 are fixed. Differences in the Z axis
   (i.e., the axis defining the relative heights of each of the ferrules to the polishing surface)
   are addressed by the polishing machine during polishing of the ferrules 970. In this
20 position, the fixture 950 is loaded onto a polishing machine, and the ferrules are polished
   using known techniques.
   Referring now to FIGS. 90-94, another example fixture 990 is shown. The fixture 990
   includes sub-fixtures 992, 994 that are similar to that of the fixture 950 described above.
25 However, the sub-fixtures 992, 994 include hinges 996, 998 that allow the sub-fixtures
   992, 994 to form a generally curved profile. See FIGS. 93-94.
   Specifically, the sub-fixture 992 includes hinges 996, 998 that allow the flat sub-fixture
   992 to be pivoted to form a radius between components 992A, 992B, 992C of the sub
30 fixture 992. When placed on a base 991 of the fixture 990, the sub-fixtures 992, 994 can be
   curved to generally form a hexagonal shape. As shown in FIG. 94, this hexagonal shape
   approximates a radius, so that when the ferrules held by the sub-fixtures 992, 994 are
                                                  25

   polished using standard polishing techniques, there is no significant difference in the travel
   between ferrules upon the polishing surface. In other words, the ferrules held by the sub
   fixtures 992, 994 travel in approximately a same amount during polishing. In one example,
   the ferrules are held so that the difference in travel is less than four percent. This assures
 5 that no ferrules are over- or under-polished.
   In some examples, the sub-fixtures 992, 994 are biased into the flat position. In other
   words, when no pressure is exerted onto the sub-fixture 992, the components 992A, 992B,
   992C align linearly (i.e., flat) with respect to one another, similar to that of the sub-fixtures
10 952, 954. When force is applied, the components 992A, 992C can be rotated relative to the
   component 992B to form the radiused shape shown in FIGS. 93-94. When the force is
   released, the components 992A and 992C again align linearly. In this example, a spring,
   such as a leaf spring, can be positioned on the components 992A and 992C to bias the
   components 992A and 992C into the linear alignment.
15
   Referring now to FIG. 95, a duplex flex circuit 900 is shown. In this example, the duplex
   flex circuit 900 includes a substrate 904 with fibers 906, 908 running therethrough, similar
   to that shown in FIGS. 53-61. The fibers 906, 908 are terminated with ferrules 911.
20 At an end opposite the termination, the fibers 906, 908 form a single loop 902 such that the
   fiber 906 is optically coupled to the fiber 908. In this manner, the duplex flex circuit 900
   can be tested using the ferrules 911 that can be connected to testing equipment. Signals can
   be sent through either fiber 906, 908 and received using the opposite fiber for testing.
25 Once testing is complete, the loop 902 can be cut, thereby forming two separate fiber optic
   pathways. The resulting free fiber ends can be terminated using one or more conventional
   methods, such as those described above.
   Referring now to FIGS. 96-106, another example fixture 1920 and process for making flex
30 circuits is shown.
                                                   26

   In FIGS. 96-98, the fixture 1920 includes a fixture body 1922 defining a plurality of
   channels 1929 into which duplex flex circuits 1932 are positioned. At an end 1926 of the
   fixture 1920, ferrule hubs 1928 are positioned (which are similar to ferrule hubs 846
   described above) prior to placement of the duplex flex circuits 1932.
 5
   Next, duplex flex circuits 1932, which have been stripped, are loaded into the channels
   1929 formed in the fixture body 1922. Fibers 1934 associated with each of the duplex flex
   circuits 1932 are positioned within and extend through the ferrule hubs 1928.
10 The fixture 1920 is then placed into a curing station (not shown) so that an epoxy within
   the ferrule hubs 1928 is cured to thereby bond the ferrule hubs 1928 to the respective
   duplex flex circuits 1932. After curing, the fibers 1934 are cleaved.
   Referring now to FIG. 99, once the fibers 1934 are cleaved, the duplex flex circuits 1932
15 are removed from the fixture 1920 and placed onto a fixture 1940 for polishing. The
   fixture 1940 includes a plurality of locations 1942 into which the ferrule hubs 1928 are
   loaded, allowing the fibers 1934 to extend below the fixture 1940. The duplex flex circuits
   1932 are then polished using known techniques, as described above. After polishing, the
   duplex flex circuits 1932 can be tested.
20
   Referring now to FIGS. 100-101, a lower member 1946 of a clamp structure (see clamp
   structure 780 described above) is positioned within an opening 1944 formed within a
   member 1924 of the fixture body 1922. Next, the duplex flex circuits 1932, which have
   been polished and tested, are loaded back into the fixture 1920.
25
   As shown in FIG. 102-106, the fixture 1920 is mounted to a ribbonizing plate 1950, and a
   clamp 1952 holds a free end of the duplex flex circuits 1932. Next, an adapter 1954 is
   fitted to the fixture 1920, and then heating and stripping tool components 1956, 1960 are
   mounted to strip the duplex flex circuits 1932. The upper member 1960 is mounted to the
30 lower member 1946 of the clamp.
                                                 27

   The fibers are thereupon cleaved, and a cure adapter 1958 is mounted to the fixture 1920.
   An MPO connector 1964 is positioned in place on the cure adapter 1958, and epoxy is
   applied. The fixture 1920 is then loaded into a curing station to cure the epoxy to thereby
   couple the fibers of the flex circuits 1932 to the MPO connector 1964, and the ferrules
 5 associated with the MPO connector 1964 are cleaved. Finally, the flex circuit is removed
   from the fixture 1920, the ferrules associated with the MPO connector 1964 are polished
   and tested.
