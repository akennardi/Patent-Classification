                                                              ABSTRACT
                A method of reducing the likelihood of infection requiring use of antibiotics
during or after induction of labour in a female, comprises administering intravaginally
to the female an insert comprising a cross-linked polyurethane reaction product of a
polyethylene glycol, a triol and a diisocyanate, the insert containing 200 pg
misoprostol; the likelihood of infection being reduced in comparison to the
administration of said insert containing 10 mg dinoprostone.

                                                             Misoprostol Formulation
                This is a divisional of Australian patent application No. 2013294956, the entire
contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
                The present invention relates to the use of misoprostol for the induction of
labour in a pregnant female, and in particular to the use of a sustained delivery device
or insert containing substantially 200 pg misoprostol for intravaginal use. Such use
includes methods of therapy and compositions for use in such methods.
                 Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1 , and has been
increasingly used for cervical ripening and labour induction administered both
vaginally and orally. In some countries, it is available as a 1 00 pg or 200 pg tablet,
which is quartered or halved and then placed in the vagina every four to six hours.
However, splitting tablets does not provide adequate control of dosing of misoprostol,
nor is drug release from the tablet fragments steady or well defined.
                 Our patent application W02004/029125 discloses a controlled release vaginal
pessary comprising misoprostol in a cross-linked polyurethane polymer. Sustained
release data in vitro is provided. Our patent application W02006/013335 discloses
that the long term storage properties of such misoprostol cross-linked polyurethane
sustained release devices may be improved by maintaining the water content at a low
level.
                A prostaglandin-containing vaginal pessary has been available for a number of
years under the trade mark Propess/Cervidil. It contains 10mg of the PGE2
prostaglandin dinoprostone in a cross-linked polyurethane matrix for sustained
vaginal release. The pessary is contained within a net bag and has a retrieval cord or
tape, allowing the pessary to be withdrawn once the desired dose has been
administered or when the woman reaches an appropriate stage during labour.
                 Cross-linked polyurethane formulations containing a prostaglandin are also
disclosed in US4931288.
                 Patents US6642278, US2004/044080 and W02003/011301 disclose other
background information.

               The normal gestation period in a human female is around 40 weeks. Induction
of labour may be considered if the pregnancy progresses beyond the 40 week term
without the baby being born. Generally, induction is considered if the pregnancy goes
beyond the 41st or 42nd week. Induction may also be considered for a variety of
other medical reasons. The so called "Bishop Score" and "Modified Bishop Score" are
pre-labour scoring systems used to assess the progression of labour and/or to
determine whether induction of labour will be required. The duration of labour is
inversely correlated with the Modified Bishop Score; a score that exceeds 8 describes
a patient

WO 2014/016390                                                           PCT/EP2013/065759

 most likely to achieve a successful vaginal birth. Modified Bishop Scores of less than 4
 usually require that a cervical ripening method be used before other methods.            The
 determination of a Bishop score and/or Modified Bishop Score involve assessing
 certain factors including, cervical dilation, length of cervix, cervical effacement, cervical
 consistency, cervical position, and foetal station.
          Induced labour tends to be more painful for the women and can lead to
 increased use of analgesics. It is also possible that induction may lead to an increased
 likelihood of caesarean section delivery for the baby.            Medical reasons for the
 inducement of labour include hypertension or pre-eclampsia in the mother. However,
 induction may have adverse events, such as uterine tachysystole, foetal heart rate
 (FHR) irregularities, meconium in amniotic fluid, poor neonatal condition (Apgar score),
 postpartum haemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, diabetes and poor neonatal respiration.
          Misoprostol controlled release pessaries have been investigated for possible
 clinical use and results are disclosed in a number of references including Powers et al.

 publication W02011/156812, where the principal basis of comparison is absence of
 drug or escalating misoprostol dosage.           Generally speaking, these studies show
 improved speed to vaginal delivery using misoprostol 200 pg pessaries without
 increased rate of caesarean delivery.
          The present application is based on the discovery of further surprising benefits
 of misoprostol - containing controlled release vaginal pessaries.
          The present invention provides in one aspect a method of reducing the time
 from start of active labour to delivery after induction of labour in a female, which
 comprises administering intravaginally to the female an insert comprising a cross-linked
 reaction production of a polyethylene glycol, a triol and a diisocyanate, the insert
 containing 200 pg misoprostol; the time being reduced in comparison to the
 administration of said insert containing 10 mg dinoprostone.
          Another aspect provides a method of reducing the likelihood of infection
 requiring use of antibiotics during or after induction of labour in a female, which
 comprises administering intravaginally to the female an insert comprising a cross-linked

WO 2014/016390                                                         PCT/EP2013/065759

 polyurethane reaction product of a polyethylene glycol, a triol and a diisocyanate, the
 insert containing 200 pg misoprostol;
           the likelihood of infection being reduced in comparison to the administration of
 said insert containing 10 mg dinoprostone.
           Inserts containing 200gg misoprostol or 10 mg dinoprostone may also be
 referred to as containing a "dose reservoir". For example, inserts containing 200 g
 misoprostol may be said to comprise a "200gg (dose) reservoir of misoprostol". One of
 skill will appreciate that the phrase "dose reservoir" may be a reference to the total
 amount of a therapeutic agent contained within any given delivery device - for example
 a vaginal insert. Once deployed within a patient, a device may release therapeutic
 agent from the reservoir. The release may be defined as a controlled release where, for
 example, predetermined quantities of agent are released from the device over a
 predetermined period of time or at predetermined intervals. The release may further be
 defined as a "sustained release" where release of the therapeutic agent in maintained
 (at a constant or variable rate) throughout the period of deployment.
           A further aspect provides a method of reducing the time of drug dosing during
 induction of labour in a female, which comprising administering intravaginally to the
 female an insert comprising a cross-linked polyurethane reaction product of a
 polyethylene glycol, a triol and a diisocyanate, the insert containing 200 pg misoprostol;
 the time being reduced in comparison to the administration of said insert containing 10
 mg disoprostone.
           The invention also relates to the therapeutic use of the misoprostol-containing
 insert in any of these methods in a human female; or method of manufacture thereof;
 and to the use of the misoprostol-containing insert for the induction of labour in a
 female suffering from any of the clinical situations described herein (hypertension,
 preeclampsia, intrauterine growth         restriction, membranes rupture    etc.). Labour
 associated adverse effects may be reduced.
           The effect of the misoprostol-containing insert is compared to a dinoprostone
 containing insert in the same cross-linked polyurethane. The term "insert" refers to the
 polyurethane hydrogel sustained delivery device, which may be loaded with drug
 (misoprostol; or dinoprostone for comparison). The term MVI 200 (or just MVI) refers
 to a formulated polyurethane insert containing 200 pg misoprostol.          The term DVI
 refers to a formulated polyurethane insert containing 10 mg dinoprostone, which is
 used as the basis for comparison in the experimental data herein. The drug-containing
 insert may also be referred to as a pessary. In the experimental data herein the term
 "insert" is also used to include drug-loaded inserts.

WO 2014/016390                                                        PCT/EP2013/065759
                                               4
          The insert provides a sustained controlled delivery of misoprostol vaginally to
 the patient.    Retrieval means may be provided for withdrawal of the drug-containing
 insert at a desired time according to clinical need.
          The female may be parous or nulliparous.
          Induction of labour may be needed in a number of clinical situations, including
 hypertension and pre-eclampsia. Induction is commonly due to the female being post
 term (normally 40 weeks), for example in the range 40 to 41 weeks, or greater than or
 equal to 41 weeks.       Induction may also be due to intrauterine growth restriction, or
 premature rupture of membranes.
          Oxytocin may be provided to the female, especially for less than 8 hours during
 first hospitalisation.
          A variety of infections may arise which require use of antibiotics, including
 chorioamnionitis. Such infections may be injurious to the mother or the baby (neonate).
  Infection   may    need    to   be treated   intrapartum,  post-partum    or    neonatally.
 Chorioamnionitis is caused by a (bacterial) infection and results in inflammation of the
 amnion and/or chorion (the foetal membranes). Chorioamniontis is known to prolong
 labour. The signs and/or symptoms of chorioamnionitis may include, for example, a
 fever (temperature > 37.5 C), uterine tenderness, purulent vaginal discharge and/or
 persistent maternal or fetal tachycardia. The antibiotic usage is the total antibiotics of
 all kinds administered to the female or neonate during such time period.
          Delivery of the baby may be vaginally or by caesarean section. Vaginal delivery
 is either spontaneous or with instrumental assistance.
          Misoprostol may act in cervical ripening and labour induction.     It is surprising
 that duration of labour is reduced - even after the misoprostol-containing insert is
 removed from the female vagina.
          Labour may be considered to comprise two phases. The first of these phases is
 known as the "latent" phase and the second is the "active phase". The latent phase of
 labour may be defined as beginning when regular uterine contractions commence and
 ends upon initiation of the active labour phase. Active labour may be defined as the
 phase in which progressive cervical dilatation to 4 cm with any frequency of
 contractions occurs or as the phase in which establishment of rhythmic, firm, adequate,
 quality uterine contractions at frequency of three or more in 10 minutes and lasting 45
 seconds or more, is detected. These contractions may cause progressive cervical
 change. Accordingly, active labour may begin when the female reaches 4 cm of
 cervical dilation and the duration of active labour is typically expected to be 6 hours,
 during which time the cervix dilates further to 10 cm or becomes "fully dilated".

WO 2014/016390                                                         PCT/EP2013/065759
                                                5
         It has now been shown that the intravaginal administration of a misoprostol
 containing insert reduces the duration of the latent and/or active phases of labour.
         The misoprostol-containing insert is administered by introduction into the female
 at a time determined by the clinician. The time from administration to active labour (as
 defined herein) is referred to as the "time to active labour" and equates to the duration
 of latent labour.   Once active labour is initiated, the time to delivery of the baby is
 referred to as "the time from active labour to delivery"; and this is the duration of active
 labour. The dosing period is the time from insertion of the drug-containing insert into
 the female to removal thereof.
         Experimental clinical trial data will now be presented by way of example.
         Figure 1 shows time to any delivery (including vaginal and cesarean delivery).
 Experi mental
 Overall Study Design
         This was a Phase Ill, double-blind,           randomised, multicentre study of
 approximately 1,350 subjects at or near term gestation requiring cervical ripening and
 induction of labour.
         Treatment consisted of administration of one randomly assigned MVI 200 or
  DVI. Nulliparous and parous subjects were randomised to their assigned treatments
 within their parity cohort in a double-blinded manner. The insert was to be kept in
 place for 24 hours unless events occurred that necessitated earlier removal (e.g., onset
 of active labour or intrapartum adverse event (AE)).        Oxytocin was permitted after
 removal of the insert and completion of a 30-minute waiting period, if needed, to
 augment or induce labour.         Enrollment was stratified by site and by parity, and
 randomization proceeded to ensure that approximately 60% nulliparous subjects and
 40% parous subjects were enrolled.
  Detailed Design
         This Phase Ill study was a double-blind, randomised study comparing MVI 200
 with DVI.   DVI (Cervidil* [Forest Laboratories], Propess* [Ferring Pharmaceuticals]) is
 an appropriate comparator for MVI 200 because it is the most commonly used
 marketed cervical ripening product available in the US and because it is identical in
 appearance to the MVI, allowing the study to be double-blinded. DVI is labeled in the
  US for a single administration of a single dose with removal at 12 hours. However,
 there is an adequate amount of drug in the reservoir to allow continuous dosing via

 WO 2014/016390                                                         PCT/EP2013/065759
                                                 6
   controlled release for up to 24 hours. Because of this, the product is approved in some
   European countries for administration up to 24 hours. The FDA agreed to allow dosing
   of up to 24 hours for the DVI during this study in order to maintain the blinded nature of
   the study.
           The study was randomised in order to prevent bias in the administration of
   different treatment groups and to attempt to have an even distribution of baseline
   characteristics across the arms of the study.
           Eligible subjects were randomised to receive one of the following treatments:
MVI 200 or DVI
           Subjects were treated with one vaginal insert for up to 24 hours, one time only.
           Intravenous oxytocin was permitted, when required, at least 30 minutes
   following removal of the study drug assuming no contraindications and active labour
   not present.
           The MVI 200 and the DVI (Cervidil) were manufactured and released by
   Controlled Therapeutics (Scotland) Ltd.
           The MVI had three components:
   *       a hydrogel polymer base measuring approximately 30 x 10 x 0.8 mm
   e       200 mcg reservoir of misoprostol released at a controlled rate
   *       a retrieval tape consisting of inert woven polyester into which the polymer base
           was placed
           The DVI had three components:
   e       a hydrogel polymer base measuring approximately 30 x 10 x 0.8 mm
   *       10 mg reservoir of dinoprostone released at approximately 0.3 mg/hour
   e       a retrieval tape consisting of inert woven polyester into which the polymer base
           was placed.

          For both the MVI and DVI, the polymer base was designed to absorb fluid from
 the vagina. As the polymer hydrates and swells, it creates a concentration gradient
 leading to a sustained release of misoprostol or dinoprostone for up to 24 hours. The
 polymer was a cross-linked polyurethane.
          The MVI and DVI study drug inserts and packaging were identical in
 appearance (double-blinded). Each study drug kit consisted of a foil sachet with a
 preprinted subject number detailed on the label. The subject number differentiated
 study drug intended for nulliparous subjects from that intended for parous subjects. A
 second self-adhesive label identical to that found on the study drug foil sachet was
 attached to the study drug foil label. The second self-adhesive label was placed on the
 study drug accountability form for that subject and kept with the study source
 documents.
          The study drug kits were stored in a freezer. If unopened study drug was not
 used following removal from the freezer, it could have been returned to the freezer for
 use at a later date. The study drug could have been removed from and returned to the
 freezer multiple times as long as it was unopened and the total cumulative time outside
 the freezer was not more than 24 hours. Any study drug remaining out of the freezer
 for more than a total of 24 hours was discarded and its destruction documented.
 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient
          Subjects were randomised to receive one of the following in a double-blind
 manner: MVI 200 or DVI.
          One randomised study drug was administered to each subject by the
  Investigator or qualified designee. The insert was placed high in the posterior vaginal
 fornix and positioned transversely. A minimal quantity of water-soluble lubricant could
 have been used to aid placement of the study drug. The insert was not pre-wetted or
 pre-swelled prior to insertion and obstetric cream was not used.
          The subject remained in bed for at least 30 minutes after insertion to ensure
 that sufficient time was provided for the insert to hydrate and start to swell.

WO 2014/016390                                                        PCT/EP2013/065759
                                               8
         The subject was instructed to use caution when using the toilet or washing to
 avoid inadvertent removal of the insert.
         Subjects were treated with study drug for up to 24 hours. The study drug was
 removed before 24 hours if there was clinical concern for the wellbeing of mother or
 baby or if an adverse event (AE) occurred:
          If the study drug fell out of the vagina spontaneously or was mistakenly
 removed early, it was not replaced. At the time of removal, an obstetrician, midwife,
 obstetric nurse, or other qualified site staff removed the insert by gently pulling on the
 retrieval tape.
 Oxytocin Use
         Oxytocin use was not permitted within 7 days prior to study drug administration
 and while the study drug was in situ.
          Intravenous oxytocin was permitted, when required, at least 30 minutes
 following removal of the study drug, assuming no contraindications and no active
 labour. Earlier administration was permitted, if required, for treatment of an emergency
 situation.
 Onset of Active Labour and Delivery
         The date and time of onset of active labour were to be recorded throughout the
 treatment period. Active labour was defined as progressive cervical dilatation to 4 cm
 with any frequency of contractions OR rhythmic, firm, adequate, quality uterine
 contractions causing progressive cervical change occurring at a frequency of three or
 more in 10 minutes and lasting 45 seconds or more.
         At time of delivery of neonate, the following were recorded:
 e       Mode of delivery (spontaneous vaginal, instrumented vaginal, or cesarean)
         -        If caesarean delivery, the reason for the caesarean delivery was
 recorded.
 e        Date and time of delivery of neonate.
 Adverse Events (AE)
         An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical
 trial subject administered a medicinal product and that does not necessarily have a
 causal relationship with this treatment.
         Subjects were questioned and observed for evidence of AEs, whether or not
 related to study drug.

          Adverse events were collected through hospital discharge following delivery.
 Adverse events that occurred during the Labour and delivery (L&D) period were
 categorised as intrapartum AEs.         Following delivery, AEs were categorised as
 postpartum (maternal) or neonatal events.
 Summaries of Adverse Event Incidence Rates
          Averse events were summarised by system organ class and preferred term for
 intrapartum, postpartum, and neonate events without regard to relationship to study
 drug.
 Summary of Outcomes and Adverse Events of Special Interest
          Safety assessments were also summarised for Outcomes and AEs of Special
  Interest. Treatment groups were compared using Fisher's exact tests for each of these
 outcomes or events. However, there was no correction for multiplicity; therefore, p
 values should be interpreted with caution.
 Results
 Time to Any Delivery (Vaginal or Caesarean) During the First Hospitalisation
          Time to any delivery mode (vaginal or caesarean) was significantly shorter in
 MVI 200 subjects (Kaplan Meier median 1096.50 minutes [18.3 hours]) compared with
  DVI subjects (Kaplan Meier median 1639.50 minutes [27.3 hours]) (p<0.001). Time to
 any delivery was also significantly shorter in MVI 200 subjects compared with DVI
 subjects among both nulliparous subjects (p<0.001) and parous subjects (p<0.001).
  Kaplan Meier estimates of time to any delivery are presented Table 2.

 Time to Active Labour (or duration of latent labour) During the First
 Hospitalisation
         Active labour was defined as progressive cervical dilatation to 4 cm with any
 frequency of contractions OR rhythmic, firm, adequate, quality uterine contractions
 causing progressive cervical change occurring at a frequency of three or more in 10
 minutes and lasting 45 seconds or more.
         Time to active labour was significantly shorter in MVI 200 subjects (median
 726.50 minutes [12.1 hours]) compared to DVI subjects (median 1116.50 minutes [18.6
 hours]) (p<0.001).   Time to active labour was also significantly shorter in MVI 200
 subjects compared with DVI subjects among both nulliparous subjects (p<0.001) and
 parous subjects (p<0.001).     Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to active labour are
 presented in Table 3.

 Extent of Exposure
           The MVI is designed to be removed upon the occurrence of various clinical
 events (e.g., upon onset of active labour). Thus, variation in the duration of exposure
 (vaginal insert in situ) was expected, as each subject had study drug removed when
 exogenous prostaglandin was no longer desirable. Discontinuation of study drug prior
 to 24 hours was more often due to an efficacy reason such as onset of active labour
