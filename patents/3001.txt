 In         a      method               for           protecting           heat    exchanger     tubes     in   boiler

enveloped by a ceramic                                           component        toward which     flue gas flows
from              at        least             two          opposite       sides,     the  ceramic     component        is
made              up        of      ceramic                  elements,       the    supplied   gas    is   guided      in
the           ceramic                 component,                  and    gas   is   supplied    by  a    blower    into
a        space               comprised                       of  the     heat     exchanger    tube      and   ceramic

virtue                    of         the             fact        that      a     slight    excess      pressure        of
inflowing                        gas           prevents             flue      gas    from  penetrating         through
gaps              between                 the           ceramic       elements       of  the   ceramic      component

 [01]           The          invention                    relates         to   a   method   for protecting                heat
exchanger                     pipes           in          boiler        systems      having at       least        one heat
exchanger pipe, which is surrounded by a ceramic component,
into which flue gas                                          is   directed from at least                  two opposite
sides.

 [03]           One of the                    functions of heat exchanger pipes                                 in boiler
systems                   is     to       evaporate                  water,       and   another      function          is   to
superheat                      vaporised                      water.        The     temperatures          in     the      heat
exchanger                     pipes           of          larger       boiler       systems     with      a   downstream
turbine                  are       required                    to    be    as   high    as  possible,          since       the
efficiency                        of         the             downstream           turbine      increases            as     the
temperature rises.
 [04]               One              drawback                      associated            in     particular                with
incinerators                           for           burning            solid      fuels,    such      as      waste       and
biomass                    incinerators,                          is     that      the    heat    exchanger            pipes
become                corroded.                    In        the     course       of   many   investigations,               it
has            been            established                       that       this     corrosion       is      induced        by
deposits of                        ash and salts                        left     clinging to the            pipes. Gas
phase               compounds                      in         the     flue      gas,     such    as     HC1      and      S02,
affect               the         composition of these deposits                                  but do not           result
directly in corrosive attacks on these parts.

made             from            silicon                  carbide,          have      not      proven         particularly
successful                       in       practice,               because          the     material          required      had
to be relatively thick                                          and heavy in              order to withstand the
load            to       which            it        is      exposed.          The     protective           component       was
backfilled                       with mortar.                     Since       the     interlocking             arrangement
did not                 allow of                  any thermal               expansion, the high operating
temperatures                           caused               the      shells         to     crack        and    even    burst

material of choice.
 [12]            However,                material                temperatures              above      400'C,      such   as

improvements over other filler materials.
 [13]           Thermal              spraying methods                        are     being used more            and more
often             as       a    corrosion                   protection           method.         Experiments        with a
wide             variety                of         material             compositions              as   the     corrosion
protection                     layer on various boiler parts have revealed that
such protective                              layers can fail unpredictably after a short
time.              Protective                      layers           of     such     kind       applied      by     thermal
spraying                     are          thus              also        unable         to      provide       long-term,
operationally reliable protection against corrosion.
 [14]            The        method              of        corrosion           protection           also   affects       the
effectiveness of the steam generator. Most waste and biogas

tube,              which             is         enveloped                 by     a   ceramic           component          toward
which              flue           gas          flows              from       at    least        two      opposite         sides,
wherein                    the         ceramic                    component           is      made        up    of      ceramic
elements,                       the          supplied                   gas      is    guided           in    the       ceramic
component,                      and         gas             is      supplied        by     a    blower       into      a   space
comprised of the heat exchanger tube and ceramic component,
so that the gas between the heat exchanger tube and ceramic
component protects the heat exchanger tube by virtue of the
fact              that            a       slight                  excess         pressure            of    inflowing          gas
prevents                   flue gas from penetrating through gaps between the
ceramic                   elements                    of         the      ceramic        component           to      the     heat
exchanger                     tubes.              In         this       context,        for      the     purposes         of  the
invention                      the        term               gas      is     understood             to   be    a    gas-phase
fluid, a liquid fluid and any fluid in any aggregate states
between the two,                                 as well as various forms                              of steam.
 [17]            The         invention                     is      based      on    the      realisation           that      even

components                       if       a gas              is    supplied       between        the heat          exchanger
pipe and the                          ceramic element.
 [18]           Heat          exchanger pipes that are                                 suspended freely in the
smoke              flue          are only accessible at                               one end. If             a gas       is    fed
into              an         area           between                 the    heat       exchanger            pipe       and       the
ceramic                    element,                     there         is    a    risk       that        this       gas        will
immediately                         escape               into       the    combustion          chamber         through          the
first               gaps          between                  the       ceramic      elements,           and      not     provide
effective                     protection                        for   all    of    the    heat       exchanger            pipes.
Consequently,                              the           supply         of   gas      was     only       used       for       heat
exchanger                       pipes                on          membrane       walls         of     boiler          systems,
because there it                                  is        easy to deliver              the gas to            any area of
the           heat           exchanger                      pipes,        and    particularly               to    the       areas
that are exposed to extreme thermal stresses.
 [19]            The         areas            of         heat        exchanger        pipes       arranged          inside          a
boiler               that           are         exposed to extreme                     thermal         stresses          are      at
a great distance from the                                               membrane walls            and are therefore
difficult                      to        reach              with       the    supplied         gas.        Moreover,            the
introduction of too much gas into the combustion chamber of
the          flue           ducts            has           a     negative      effect       on the         efficiency             of
the system.
 [20]          However, it has been discovered that, with appropriate
pressure                    and        design                of    the    ceramic       elements,            a   gas     can be
delivered to                           the         areas           of the heat         exchanger           pipe      that       are
exposed to                       the heaviest                       thermal       loading,        and then           protects
the           heat            exchanger                       pipe      inside       a   gap      between          the        heat
exchanger                      pipe           and           the      ceramic       element        in      that      a     slight
overpressure                           is        created             by   the     gas     and     prevents          the       flue
gases               from          escaping                    through       the     ceramic        component            to      the
heat exchanger pipes.

 [21]           The        chamber may                    comprise         various         parts.         It     preferably
consists                   only         of        the      heat       exchanger         pipe         and       the     ceramic
component.
 [22]             It          is       particularly                     advantageous               if       the       gas      is
delivered                     at     the         hottest            point      between        the      heat        exchanger
pipe            and         the       ceramic              element.          The    result           of    this       is     that
the          gas         is     under            the      greatest          pressure          at      the      point        where
the heat exchanger pipe is under particular thermal stress.
Depending                    on the             construction               of    the boiler             system,          it   may
also be                 advantageous to                         deliver the gas                to the          point where
the flue                   gas pressure                    is     highest,        that      is     to     say where           the
counterpressure on the                                       ceramic element is highest.
 [23]           The        ceramic              component             may be      configured              such that           the
supplied                     gas        is          routed          through        the       ceramic             component.
However, since the ceramic component is usually constructed
from a plurality                                of ceramic              elements,         there        is      a risk        that
the           delivered                   gas           might        escape       prematurely                between          the
ceramic                  elements,                   with       the     result       that        all      areas         of    the
heat exchanger pipe might not be exposed to the gas. Even a
layer              of        mortar               that        is     preferably            applied            between         the
ceramic                   elements                  and      connects           said      ceramic             elements         is
often unable to prevent the                                            gas from escaping.
 [24]            Therefore,                      it       is      suggested          to      introduce               the      gas
through a pipe included in the ceramic component. This pipe
may           be        made          from             ceramic,          and     for     example            may      also      be
constructed from multiple pipe elements. However, this pipe
is        preferably a metal pipe.                                      Since this          pipe is            enclosed by
the          ceramic             component                  and      the    inside        thereof           is    cooled       by
the gas that is passed through it,                                                 the gas may be delivered
in        a metal              pipe           to        the    site      of    a  heat      exchanger             pipe       that
is under the                       greatest thermal load. From there, the gas may

ceramic                  component,                     in     order        to    prevent       the     flue      gas      from
getting                   into         the            heat          exchanger           pipe     along       the       entire
length of the heat exchanger pipes.
 [26]           Particularly                        in      the        case     of    very    long     heat     exchanger
pipes,                 it      may         be           advantageous                to    introduce         the       gas      at
multiple points.                               Therefore, it                   is suggested that the gas be
supplied                   through                a       plurality            of     apertures        in    a    gas      pipe
arranged at defined distances                                                 along the        length of the               heat

be        delivered                  through                 a   plurality            of   infeed      means       arranged
all the way up the radiation superheater. This delivery may

adjoining                      the        heat             exchanger       tube      and    ceramic       component,
wherein                 the        gas         supply has            a blower,         the    ceramic       component
is       made           up of            several              ceramic      elements,        and    there      are gaps
between                 the        ceramic                 elements,       so that       the   supplied        gas      can
protect                 the        heat           exchanger          tube     between       the    heat     exchanger
tube             and         ceramic                 component          by   virtue       of   the     fact      that        a
slight               excess              pressure              of   inflowing         gas    prevents        flue       gas
from penetrating                                 through          gaps     between       the   ceramic        elements
of the ceramic component to the heat exchanger tubes.
 [28]               Since              the             circumferential               surface        of      the       heat
exchanger                     pipe          is         surrounded         by    the    ceramic       component,           it
is       suggested that                               the gas       infeed takes            place     first       in the
direction                       of        the             heat    exchanger          pipes       in    the      ceramic
component,                       before                 the     gas     flows      back     in    the      lengthwise
direction                     of      the         heat        exchanger        pipes      and builds         up    a    gas
pressure                     at         gaps              in    the     ceramic         component,          therefore
preventing the flue gas from getting in.
 [29]           The         gas        infeed               should    therefore         comprise        a   fan.      Said
fan          enables               the         gas         pressure       to    be   adjusted        such    that       not
too          much           gas        flows              through      the    ceramic       component        and      into
the             combustion                       chamber,            and      on     the      other       hand        that
sufficient                       counterpressure                     is    built      up   over     the     length        of
the            heat             exchanger                    pipes      to     prevent        flue       gases        from
infiltrating the heat exchanger pipes.
 [30]             In         order              to         realise       this       purpose       simply,         it      is
suggested                      that          the           gas   supply       comprises        a    gas     pipe      that
passes               inside the                     ceramic component.                The routing inside the
ceramic                  component                    holds      the     gas     pipe     and    enables       the      gas
pipe              to         be         supported                by     the      ceramic        of    the       ceramic

 [31]           In many                applications,                    heat      exchanger         pipes       suspended
in the              combustion chamber are bent into a U-shape to direct
water              or       steam            into         the     combustion            chamber        and     remove       it
therefrom.                      With such                 a configuration,                 it    is    suggested          that
the         gas          infeed            terminates                in    the     area      of bend.        This makes
it        possible                 particularly                    to     cool      the     bend     area,       which      is
particularly                          heavily               loaded,         with       freshly         supplied           gas,
and/or preferably to build a counterpressure at                                                             this loaded
site,             which           prevents                flue gases            from penetrating                as    far   as
the heat                   exchanger pipe.
 [32]          In        order          to ensure               a   sufficient           supply       of   barrier         air
even            in       the       event             of    a   fault       in     the    ceramic        component,          it
is         suggested                   that            the    gas       pipe      comprises          a   plurality          of
apertures                     positioned                   at    a    distance          from      each     other        along
the         length              of the              heat      exchanger           pipe.       These     apertures          are
preferably                         provided                  all         the       way        up      the       radiation
superheater                       or along the length of the heat exchanger pipe.
 [33]          The supplied gas is typically air. However, a gas that
promotes                    combustion                    or     affects           the     combustion,             such     as
oxygen,                    may          be          used.         Thus        for      example          flue        gas     or
particularly                          recirculated                    flue       gas     after      an     exhaust         gas
scrubbing apparatus may also be                                                introduced as the gas.
