                                  RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]           This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.
61/617,468, filed on March 29, 2012, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by

                                        BACKGROUND
[0002]           Liposomal delivery of nucleic acids has been employed as a means of
effectuating the site-specific delivery of encapsulated plasmid DNA, antisense
oligonucleotides, short interfering RNA and microRNA-based therapies, however the
efficient delivery of nucleic acids to targeted cells and tissues, as well as the subsequent
transfection of such targeted cells and tissues remains a technical challenge. Despite the
availability of multiple liposomal-based systems and vehicles to facilitate the delivery of
therapeutic agents to target cells and tissues, many problems still exist both in in vivo and in
vitro applications. For example, a significant drawback of liposomal delivery systems relates
to the construction of liposomes that have sufficient cell culture or in vivo stability to reach
desired target cells and/or intracellular compartments, and the ability of such liposomal
delivery systems to efficiently release their encapsulated materials to such target cells.
[0003]           Furthermore, many of the cationic lipids that are employed to construct such
liposomal-based vehicles are generally toxic to the targeted cells. In particular, the amount of
such cationic lipid that is necessary to deliver a therapeutically effective amount of the
encapsulated agent may be toxic to the targeted cells. Accordingly, the toxicity associated
with cationic lipid represents a significant obstacle to their general use as non-viral vectors,
particularly in the quantities necessary to successfully deliver therapeutically effective
amounts of the encapsulated materials to target cells.
[0004]           Despite the foregoing limitations, and as a results of their ability to protect and
facilitate the delivery of encapsulated materials to one or more target cells, liposomal-based
vehicles are considered an attractive carrier for therapeutic agents and remain subject to
continued development efforts. While liposomal-based vehicles that comprise a cationic lipid
component have shown promising results with regards to encapsulation, stability and site
localization, there remains a great need for improvement of liposomal-based delivery

systems. In particular, there remains a need for improved cationic and ionizable lipids that
demonstrate improved pharmacokinetic properties and which are capable of delivering
macromolecules, such as nucleic acids to a wide variety cell types and tissues with enhanced
efficiency. Importantly, there also remains a particular need for novel cationic ionizable
lipids that are characterized as having reduced toxicity and are capable of efficiently
delivering encapsulated nucleic acids and polynucleotides to targeted cells, tissues and
organs.

                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0050]          Disclosed herein are novel compounds that are useful, for example, as
liposomal delivery vehicles or as components of liposomal delivery vehicles. In certain
embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein may be used as a liposomal composition or
alternatively as component of a liposomal composition (e.g., as a lipid nanoparticle). Also
disclosed are pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) and methods of use
relating to such pharmaceutical compositions. In certain embodiments, such compounds and
compositions facilitate the delivery of, for example, encapsulated materials (e.g.,
polynucleotides) to one or more target cells, tissues and organs.
[0051]          The cationic and/or ionizable compounds disclosed herein generally comprise
both a polar (hydrophilic) head-group or moiety and a non-polar (hydrophobic or lipophilic)
tail-group or moiety. In certain embodiments, such polar head-group and non-polar tail
group are generally bound (e.g., bound by one or more of hydrogen-bonds, van der Waals'
forces, ionic interactions and covalent bonds) to each other (e.g., a head-group and a tail
group covalently bound to each other by an optionally substituted, variably unsaturated C1
C1o alkyl or alkenyl). In certain embodiments, the head-group or moiety is hydrophilic (e.g.,
a hydrophilic head-group comprising an optionally-substituted alkyl amino). As used herein,
                                               15

 WO 2013/149140                                                               PCT/US2013/034602
the term "hydrophilic" is used to indicate in qualitative terms that a functional group is water
preferring, and typically such groups are water-soluble. For example, disclosed herein are
compounds that comprise a variably unsaturated alkyl functional group bound to one or more
hydrophilic groups (e.g., a hydrophilic head-group), wherein such hydrophilic groups
comprise an amino group or an optionally-substituted alkyl amino group.
[0052]          In certain embodiments, the selected hydrophilic functional group or moiety
may alter or otherwise impart properties to the compound or to the liposomal composition of
which such compound is a component (e.g., by improving the transfection efficiencies of a
lipid nanoparticle of which the compound is a component). For example, the incorporation of
amino group as a hydrophilic head-group in the compounds disclosed herein may promote
the fusogenicity of such compound (or of the liposomal composition of which such
compound is a component) with the cell membrane of one or more target cells, thereby
enhancing, for example, the transfection efficiencies of such compound. Similarly, the
incorporation of one or more alkyl amino groups or moieties into the disclosed compounds
(e.g., as a head-group) may further promote disruption of the endosomal/lysosomal
membrane by exploiting the fusogenicity of such amino groups. This is based not only on the
pKa of the amino group of the composition, but also on the ability of the amino group to
undergo a hexagonal phase transition and fuse with the vesicle membrane. (Koltover, et al.
Science (1998) 281: 78-81.) The result is believed to promote the disruption of the vesicle
membrane and release of the lipid nanoparticle contents.
[0053]           Similarly, in certain embodiments the incorporation of, for example, a
positively charged or ionizable hydrophilic head-group in the compounds disclosed herein
may serve to promote endosomal or lysosomal release of, for example, contents that are
encapsulated in a liposomal composition (e.g., lipid nanoparticle) of the invention. Such
enhanced release may be achieved by one or both of proton-sponge mediated disruption
mechanism and/or an enhanced fusogenicity mechanism. The proton-sponge mechanism is
based on the ability of a compound, and in particular a functional moiety or group of the
compound, to buffer the acidification of the endosome. This may be manipulated or
otherwise controlled by the pKa of the compound or of one or more of the functional groups
comprising such compound (e.g., amino). Such endosomal disruption properties in turn
promote osmotic swelling and the disruption of the liposomal membrane, followed by the
transfection or intracellular release of the polynucleotide materials loaded or encapsulated
therein into the target cell.

[0054]          The lipid compounds disclosed herein may generally comprise one or more
cationic and/or ionizable functional head-groups, such as an amine functional group having
one or more alkyl or aryl substituents. In certain embodiments the lipid compounds disclosed
herein may comprise a cationic ionizable amino functional head-group to which is bound
(e.g., covalently bound) a hydrophobic functional groups, substituents or moieties (e.g., an R1
group and a R2 group, wherein both R1 and R2 are independently selected from the group
consisting of hydrogen and C1_ C1o alkyls). In certain embodiments, such hydrophilic and
hydrophobic functional groups are bound (e.g., covalently bound) to each other by way of an
intermediary group (e.g., an alkyl or a variably unsaturated alkenyl).
[0055]          The compounds described herein (e.g., HGT5000, HGT5001 and HGT5002),
are also characterized by their reduced toxicity, in particular relative to traditional lipids and
cationic lipids such as C12-200. Accordingly, one or more of the compounds disclosed
herein may be used in lieu of one or more traditional lipids that are characterized as being
toxic in the amounts necessary to deliver an effective amount of one or more agents to target
cells and tissues. For example, in some embodiments, pharmaceutical and liposomal
compositions may be prepared such that they comprise one or more of the ionizable cationic
lipid compounds disclosed herein (e.g., HGT5000, HGT5001, and/or HGT5002) as a means
of reducing or otherwise eliminating the toxicity associated with the liposomal composition.
The cationic ionizable compounds or lipids (e.g., HGT5000, HGT5001 and/or HGT5002)
may be used as the sole cationic lipid in one or more of the pharmaceutical and liposomal
compositions described herein (e.g., lipid nanoparticles), or alternatively may be combined
with traditional cationic lipids (e.g., LIPOFECTIN or LIPOFECTAMINE), non-cationic
lipids, PEG-modified lipids and/or helper lipids. In certain embodiments, the compounds
described herein, or alternatively the total cationic lipid component of the pharmaceutical and
liposomal compositions may comprise a molar ratio of about 1% to about 90%, about 2% to
about 70%, about 5% to about 50%, about 10% to about 4 0% of the total lipid present in such
pharmaceutical or liposomal composition (e.g., a lipid nanoparticle), or preferably about 20%
to about 7 0% of the total lipid present in such pharmaceutical or liposomal composition (e.g.,
a lipid nanoparticle). Additionally, combining or enriching liposomal vehicles with the
cationic ionizable lipid compounds disclosed herein allows a corresponding reduction in the
concentration of the other lipid components of the liposomal vehicle, thereby providing a
means of reducing or otherwise mitigating the toxicity associated with other cationic lipids
(e.g., C12-200) that may also be present in the liposomal vehicle.

[0056]          In certain embodiments, at least one of the functional groups of moieties that
comprise the compounds disclosed herein is hydrophobic in nature (e.g., a hydrophobic tail
group comprising a naturally-occurring lipid such as cholesterol). As used herein, the term
"hydrophobic" is used to indicate in qualitative terms that a functional group is water
avoiding, and typically such groups are not water soluble. For example, in certain
embodiments the hydrophobic or lipophilic tail-group (e.g., one or more of an L1 group and
an L2 group) of the compounds disclosed herein may comprise one or more non-polar groups
such as cholesterol or an optionally substituted, variably saturated or unsaturated alkyl or
alkenyl (e.g., an optionally substituted octadeca-9,12-diene).
[0057]          In certain embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein comprise, for
example, at least one hydrophilic head-group and at least one hydrophobic tail-group, each
bound to each other by, for example an optionally substituted, variably saturated or
unsaturated alkyl or alkenyl, thereby rendering such compounds amphiphilic. As used herein
to describe a compound or composition, the term "amphiphilic" means the ability to dissolve
in both polar (e.g., water) and non-polar (e.g., lipid) environments. For example, in certain
embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein comprise at least one lipophilic tail-group
(e.g., cholesterol or a C6 -C2 0 alkyl or alkenyl) and at least one hydrophilic head-group (e.g.,
an alkyl amino), each bound to an intermediary C1 -C2 0 alkyl or alkenyl group (e.g., hexane or
hexene).
[0058]          It should be noted that the terms "head-group" and "tail-group" as used
describe the compounds of the present invention, and in particular functional groups that
comprise such compounds, are used for ease of reference to describe the orientation of one or
more functional groups relative to other functional groups. For example, in certain
embodiments a hydrophilic head-group (e.g., amino) is bound (e.g., by one or more of
hydrogen-bonds, van der Waals' forces, ionic interactions and covalent bonds) to an alkyl or
alkenyl functional group (e.g., hex-1-ene), which in turn is bound to a hydrophobic tail-group
(e.g., cholesterol or a C6 -C 2 0 variably unsaturated alkenyl).
        Also disclosed herein are compounds having the structure of formula (I):

[0084]           The compounds described herein may be used to construct liposomal
compositions that facilitate or enhance the delivery and release of encapsulated materials
(e.g., one or more therapeutic polynucleotides) to one or more target cells (e.g., by
permeating or fusing with the lipid membranes of such target cells). For example, when a
liposomal composition (e.g., a lipid nanoparticle) comprises or is otherwise enriched with one
or more of the compounds disclosed herein, the phase transition in the lipid bilayer of the one
or more target cells may facilitate the delivery of the encapsulated materials (e.g., one or
more therapeutic polynucleotides encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle) into the one or more
target cells. Similarly, in certain embodiments the compounds disclosed herein may be used
to prepare liposomal vehicles that are characterized by their reduced toxicity in vivo. In
certain embodiments, the reduced toxicity is a function of the high transfection efficiencies
associated with the compositions disclosed herein, such that a reduced quantity of such
composition may administered to the subject to achieve a desired therapeutic response or
outcome.

herein may be characterized by enhanced transfection efficiencies and their ability to provoke
specific biological outcomes. Such outcomes may include, for example enhanced cellular
uptake, endosomal/lysosomal disruption capabilities and/or promoting the release of
encapsulated materials (e.g., polynucleotides) intracellularly.
[0086]           In certain embodiments the compounds described herein (and the
pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions comprising such compounds) employ a
multifunctional strategy to facilitate the delivery of encapsulated materials (e.g., one or more
polynucleotides) to, and subsequent transfection of one or more target cells. For example, in
certain embodiments the compounds described herein (and the pharmaceutical and liposomal
compositions comprising such compounds) are characterized as having one or more of
receptor-mediated endocytosis, clathrin-mediated and caveolae-mediated endocytosis,
phagocytosis and macropinocytosis, fusogenicity, endosomal or lysosomal disruption and/or
releasable properties that afford such compounds advantages relative other similarly
classified lipids.
[0087]           In certain embodiments the compounds and the pharmaceutical and liposomal
compositions of which such compounds are a component (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) exhibit an
enhanced (e.g., increased) ability to transfect one or more target cells. Accordingly, also
provided herein are methods of transfecting one or more target cells. Such methods generally
comprise the step of contacting the one or more target cells with the compounds and/or
pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein (e.g., an HGT5000-, HGT5001- and/or
HGT5002-based lipid nanoparticle encapsulating one or more polynucleotides) such that the
one or more target cells are transfected with the materials encapsulated therein (e.g., one or
more polynucleotides). As used herein, the terms "transfect" or "transfection" refer to the
intracellular introduction of one or more encapsulated materials (e.g., nucleic acids and/or
polynucleotides) into a cell, or preferably into a target cell. The introduced polynucleotide
may be stably or transiently maintained in the target cell. The term "transfection efficiency"
refers to the relative amount of such encapsulated material (e.g., polynucleotides) up-taken
by, introduced into and/or expressed by the target cell which is subject to transfection. In
practice, transfection efficiency may be estimated by the amount of a reporter polynucleotide
product produced by the target cells following transfection. In certain embodiments, the
compounds and pharmaceutical compositions described herein demonstrate high transfection
efficiencies thereby improving the likelihood that appropriate dosages of the encapsulated

materials (e.g., one or more polynucleotides) will be delivered to the site of pathology and
subsequently expressed, while at the same time minimizing potential systemic adverse effects
or toxicity associated with the compound or their encapsulated contents.
[0088]           A wide range of materials that can exert pharmaceutical or therapeutic effects
can be delivered to target cells using the compounds, compositions and methods of the
present invention. Accordingly, the compounds and pharmaceutical and liposomal
compositions described herein may be used to encapsulate any materials suitable for
intracellular delivery. In certain embodiments, such encapsulated materials are capable of
conferring a therapeutic or diagnostic benefit upon the cells into which such materials are
delivered, and may include any drugs, biologics and/or diagnostics. The materials can be
organic or inorganic. Organic molecules can be peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids,
sterols, nucleic acids (including peptide nucleic acids), or any combination thereof. In certain
embodiments, the pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions described herein can comprise
or otherwise encapsulate more than one type of material, for example, two or more different
polynucleotide sequences encoding a protein, an enzyme and/or a steroid. In certain
embodiments, the encapsulated materials are one or more polynucleotides and nucleic acids.
[0089]           As used herein, the terms "polynucleotide" and "nucleic acid" are used
interchangeably to refer to genetic material (e.g., DNA or RNA), and when such terms are
used with respect to the compounds and compositions described herein (e.g., lipid
nanoparticles) generally refer to the genetic material encapsulated by such compounds and
compositions (e.g., lipid nanoparticles). In some embodiments, the polynucleotide is RNA.
Suitable RNA includes mRNA, siRNA, miRNA, snRNA and snoRNA. Contemplated
polynucleotides also include large intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA), which generally
does not encode proteins, but rather function, for example, in immune signaling, stem cell
biology and the development of disease. (See, e.g., Guttman, et al., 458: 223-227 (2009); and
Ng, et al., Nature Genetics 42: 1035-1036 (2010), the contents of which are incorporated
herein by reference). In certain embodiments, the polynucleotides encapsulated by the
compounds or pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions of the invention include RNA or
stabilized RNA encoding a protein or enzyme (e.g., mRNA encoding a-galactosidase A or
arylsulfatase A). The present invention contemplates the use of such polynucleotides (and in
particular RNA or stabilized RNA) as a therapeutic that is capable of being expressed by
target cells to thereby facilitate the production (and in certain instances the excretion) of a
functional enzyme or protein by such target cells as disclosed for example, in International

are both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. For example, in certain
embodiments, upon the expression of one or more polynucleotides by target cells the
production of a functional enzyme or protein in which a subject is deficient (e.g., a urea cycle
enzyme or an enzyme associated with a lysosomal storage disorder) may be observed. The
term "functional", as used herein to qualify a protein or enzyme, means that the protein or
enzyme has biological activity, or alternatively is able to perform the same, or a similar
function as the native or normally-functioning protein or enzyme.
[0090]           In certain embodiments, the compounds and the pharmaceutical and liposomal
compositions described herein are formulated as a blended formulation or composition. For
example, in one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition comprises a blended formulation
comprising a 3:1 ratio of a first lipid nanoparticle comprising HGT5000 and a second lipid
nanoparticle comprising HGT5001. Accordingly, also provided herein are blended
pharmaceutical compositions and related methods for modulating the expression of a
polynucleotide in one or more target cells and tissues, as disclosed for example, in United
States Provisional Application No. 61/494,714 (Attorney Docket No. SHIR-021-001), filed
June 8, 2011, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
Also contemplated are methods for modulating (e.g., increasing or synergistically increasing)
the production and/or secretion of, for example, one or more functional polypeptides, proteins
or enzymes that are encoded by one or more polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) encapsulated in
such blended pharmaceutical compositions by one or more target cells.
[0091]           In the context of the present invention the term "expression" is used in its
broadest sense to refer to either the transcription of a specific gene or polynucleotide into at
least one mRNA transcript, or the translation of at least one mRNA or polynucleotide into a
protein or enzyme. For example, in certain embodiments the compounds and the
pharmaceutical or liposomal compositions described herein comprise a polynucleotide (e.g.,
mRNA) which encodes a functional protein or enzyme. In the context of such mRNA
polynucleotides, the term expression refers to the translation of such mRNA (e.g., by the
target cells) to produce the polypeptide or protein encoded thereby.
[0092]           In certain embodiments, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions
provided herein are capable of modulating the expression of aberrantly expressed nucleic

acids and polynucleotides in one or more target cells and tissues. Accordingly, also provided
herein are methods of treating disease in a subject by administering an effective amount of
the compounds and/or the pharmaceutical or liposomal compositions described herein to the
subject. In certain embodiments, such methods may enhance (e.g., increase) the expression
of a polynucleotide and/or increase the production and secretion of a functional polypeptide
product in one or more target cells and tissues (e.g., hepatocytes). In some embodiments, the
targeted cells or tissues aberrantly express the polynucleotide encapsulated by one or more of
the compounds or pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions (e.g., lipid nanoparticles)
described herein. Also provided herein are methods of increasing the expression of one or
more polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) in one or more target cells, tissues and organs (e.g., the
lungs, heart, spleen, liver and/or kidneys). Generally, such methods comprise contacting the
target cells with one or more compounds and/or pharmaceutical or liposomal compositions
that comprise or otherwise encapsulate one or more polynucleotides.
[0093]           In certain embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein may be used as a
liposome or as a component of a liposome. Specifically, in certain embodiments the
compounds disclosed herein may be used as a lipid (e.g., cationic lipid) component of a
liposomal composition (e.g., a lipid nanoparticle). Such liposomes may be used to
encapsulate materials and facilitate the delivery of such materials to one or more target cells,
tissues and organs. As used herein, the term "liposome" generally refers to a vesicle
composed of lipids (e.g., amphiphilic lipids) arranged in one or more spherical bilayer or
bilayers. In certain embodiments, the liposome is a lipid nanoparticle (e.g., a lipid
nanoparticle comprising one or more of the cationic lipid compounds disclosed herein). Such
liposomes may be unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles which have a membrane formed from
a lipophilic material and an aqueous interior that contains the encapsulated materials (e.g.,
polynucleotides) to be delivered to one or more target cells, tissues and organs. In certain
embodiments, the pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions described herein comprise one
or more lipid nanoparticles. Contemplated liposomes include lipid nanoparticles. Examples
of suitable lipids (e.g., cationic lipids) that may be used to form the liposomes and lipid
nanoparticles contemplated hereby include one or more of the compounds disclosed herein
(e.g., HGT5000, HGT5001, and/or HGT5002). Such liposomes and lipid nanoparticles may
also comprise additional cationic lipids such as C12-200, DLin-KC2-DMA, DOPE, DMG
PEG-2000, non-cationic lipids, cholesterol-based lipids, helper lipids, PEG-modified lipids,
as well as the phosphatidyl compounds (e.g., phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine,

phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingolipids, cerebrosides, and gangliosides)
and combinations or mixtures of the forgoing.
[0094]          Several cationic lipids have been described in the literature, many of which are
commercially available. In certain embodiments, such cationic lipids are included in the
pharmaceutical or liposomal compositions described herein in addition to one or more of the
compounds or lipids disclosed herein (e.g., HGT5000). In some embodiments, the cationic
lipid N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride or "DOTMA" is
used. (Felgner et al. (Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. 84, 7413 (1987); U.S. Pat. No. 4,897,355).
DOTMA can be formulated alone or can be combined with
dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine or "DOPE" or other cationic or non-cationic lipids into a
lipid nanoparticle. Other suitable cationic lipids include, for example C12-200, 5
carboxyspermylglycinedioctadecylamide or "DOGS," 2,3-dioleyloxy-N-[2(spermine

287 (2005); Morrissey, DV., et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 23(8): 1003-1007 (2005); PCT
Publication W02005/121348A1). The use of cholesterol-based cationic lipids to formulate
the compositions (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) is also contemplated by the present invention.
                                               30

 WO 2013/149140                                                              PCT/US2013/034602
Such cholesterol-based cationic lipids can be used, either alone or in combination with other
cationic or non-cationic lipids. Suitable cholesterol-based cationic lipids include, for
example, DC-Chol (N,N-dimethyl-N-ethylcarboxamidocholesterol), 1,4-bis(3-N-oleylamino
propyl)piperazine (Gao, et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 179, 280 (1991); Wolf et al.
BioTechniques 23, 139 (1997); U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,335).
[0095]           In addition, several reagents are commercially available to enhance
transfection efficacy. Suitable examples include LIPOFECTIN (DOTMA:DOPE)
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), LIPOFECTAMINE (DOSPA:DOPE) (Invitrogen),
LIPOFECTAMINE2000. (Invitrogen), FUGENE, TRANSFECTAM (DOGS), and
EFFECTENE. Also contemplated are cationic lipids such as the dialkylamino-based,
imidazole-based, and guanidinium-based lipids. For example, also contemplated is the use of
the cationic lipid (3S, 10R, 13R, 17R)-10, 13-dimethyl-17-((R)-6-methylheptan-2-yl)-2, 3, 4,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17-tetradecahydro-1H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthren-3-yl 3
(lH-imidazol-4-yl)propanoate or "ICE", as disclosed in International Application No.
PCT/US2010/058457, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their
entirety.
[0096]           The use and inclusion of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified phospholipids
and derivatized lipids such as derivatized cerarmides (PEG-CER), including N-Octanoyl
Sphingosine-1-[Succinyl(Methoxy Polyethylene Glycol)-2000] (C8 PEG-2000 ceramide) in
the liposomal and pharmaceutical compositions described herein is also contemplated,
preferably in combination with one or more of the compounds and lipids disclosed herein.
Contemplated PEG-modified lipids include, but are not limited to, a polyethylene glycol
chain of up to 5 kDa in length covalently attached to a lipid with alkyl chain(s) of C6 -C2 0
length. The addition of such components may prevent complex aggregation and may also
provide a means for increasing circulation lifetime and increasing the delivery of the lipid
polynucleotide composition to the target tissues, (Klibanov et al. (1990) FEBS Letters, 268
(1): 235-237), or they may be selected to rapidly exchange out of the formulation in vivo (see
U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,613). Particularly useful exchangeable lipids are PEG-ceramides having
shorter acyl chains (e.g., C14 or C18). The PEG-modified phospholipid and derivatized
lipids of the present invention may comprise a molar ratio from about 0% to about 20%,
about 0.5% to about 20%, about 1% to about 15%, about 4 % to about 10%, or about 2 % of
the total lipid present in a liposomal lipid nanoparticle.

WO 2013/149140                                                                 PCT/US2013/034602
[00971          The present invention also contemplates the use of non-cationic lipids in one
or more of the pharmaceutical or liposomal compositions (e.g., lipid nanoparticles). Such
non-cationic lipids are preferably used in combination with one or more of the compounds
and lipids disclosed herein. As used herein, the phrase "non-cationic lipid" refers to any
neutral, zwitterionic or anionic lipid. As used herein, the phrase "anionic lipid" refers to any
of a number of lipid species that carry a net negative charge at a selected pH, such as
physiological pH. Non-cationic lipids include, but are not limited to,
distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC),
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG),
dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG), dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE),
palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), palmitoyloleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine
(POPE), dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane- 1
carboxylate (DOPE-mal), dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine (DPPE),
dimyristoylphosphoethanolamine (DMPE), distearoyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (DSPE),
DLPE (1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine ), DPPS (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn
glycero-3 -phospho-L-serine), 16-0-monomethyl PE, 16-0-dimethyl PE, 18-1-trans PE, 1
stearoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidyethanolamine (SOPE), ceramides, sphingomyelins, cholesterol,
or a mixture thereof. Such non-cationic lipids may be used alone, but are preferably used in
combination with other excipients, for example, one or more of the cationic lipid compounds
disclosed herein (e.g., HGT5000, HGT5001, and/or HGT5002). When used in combination
with a cationic lipid, the non-cationic lipid may comprise a molar ratio of 5% to about 90%,
or preferably about 10 % to about 70% of the total lipid present in the lipid nanoparticle.
[0098]          Also contemplated is inclusion of polymers in the lipid nanoparticles that
comprise the pharmaceutical or liposomal compositions described herein. Suitable polymers
may include, for example, polyacrylates, polyalkycyanoacrylates, polylactide, polylactide
polyglycolide copolymers, polycaprolactones, dextran, albumin, gelatin, alginate, collagen,
chitosan, cyclodextrins and polyethylenimine. Such polymers may be used alone, but are
preferably used in combination with other excipients, for example, one or more of the
cationic lipid compounds disclosed herein (e.g., HGT5000, HGT5001, and/or HGT5002).
[0099]          In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions (e.g.,
lipid nanoparticles) are formulated based in part upon their ability to facilitate the transfection
(e.g., of a polynucleotide) of a target cell. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical and
liposomal compositions (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) may be selected and/or prepared to
                                                 32

 WO 2013/149140                                                                 PCT/US2013/034602
optimize delivery of polynucleotides to a target cell, tissue or organ. For example, if the
target cell is a hepatocyte the properties of the pharmaceutical and/or liposomal compositions
(e.g., size, charge and/or pH) may be optimized to effectively deliver such composition (e.g.,
lipid nanoparticles) to the target cell or organ, reduce immune clearance and/or promote
retention in that target organ. Alternatively, if the target tissue is the central nervous system
the selection and preparation of the pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions must
consider penetration of, and retention within the blood brain barrier and/or the use of
alternate means of directly delivering such compositions (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) to such
target tissue (e.g., via intracerebrovascular administration). In certain embodiments, the
pharmaceutical or liposomal compositions or their constituent lipid nanoparticles may be
combined with agents that facilitate the transfer of encapsulated materials (e.g., agents which
disrupt or improve the permeability of the blood brain barrier and thereby enhance the
transfer of such encapsulated polynucleotides to the target cells). While the pharmaceutical
and liposomal compositions described herein (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) can facilitate
introduction of encapsulated materials such as one or more polynucleotides into target cells,
the addition of polycations (e.g., poly L-lysine and protamine) to, for example one or more of
the lipid nanoparticles that comprise the pharmaceutical compositions as a copolymer can
also facilitate, and in some instances markedly enhance the transfection efficiency of several
types of cationic liposomes by 2-28 fold in a number of cell lines both in vitro and in vivo.
(See, N.J. Caplen, et al., Gene Ther. 1995; 2: 603; S. Li, et al., Gene Ther. 1997; 4, 891.)
[0100]           In certain embodiments of the present invention, the pharmaceutical and
liposomal compositions (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) are prepared to encapsulate one or more
materials or therapeutic agents (e.g., polynucleotides). The process of incorporating a desired
therapeutic agent (e.g., mRNA) into a liposome or a lipid nanoparticle is referred to herein as
or "loading" or "encapsulating" (Lasic, et al., FEBS Lett., 312: 255-258, 1992). The lipid
nanoparticle-loaded or -encapsulated materials (e.g., polynucleotides) may be completely or
partially located in the interior space of the lipid nanoparticle, within the bilayer membrane of
the lipid nanoparticle, or associated with the exterior surface of the lipid nanoparticle.
[0101]           Loading or encapsulating, for example, a polynucleotide into a lipid
nanoparticle may serve to protect the polynucleotide from an environment which may contain
enzymes or chemicals (e.g., serum) that degrade such polynucleotides and/or systems or
receptors that cause the rapid excretion of such polynucleotides. Accordingly, in some
embodiments, the compositions described herein are capable of enhancing the stability of the
                                                 33

 WO 2013/149140                                                                 PCT/US2013/034602
polynucleotide(s) encapsulated thereby, particularly with respect to the environments into
which such polynucleotides will be exposed. Encapsulating materials, such as for example
polynucleotides into one or more of the pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions
described herein (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) also facilitates the delivery of such polynucleotides
into the target cells and tissues. For example, lipid nanoparticles comprising one or more of
the lipid compounds described herein can allow the encapsulated polynucleotide to reach the
target cell or may preferentially allow the encapsulated polynucleotide to reach the target
cells or organs on a discriminatory basis (e.g., the lipid nanoparticles may concentrate in the
liver or spleens of a subject to which such lipid nanoparticles are administered).
Alternatively, the lipid nanoparticles may limit the delivery of encapsulated polynucleotides
to other non-targeted cells or organs where the presence of the encapsulated polynucleotides
may be undesirable or of limited utility.
[0102]           In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions
described herein (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) are prepared by combining multiple lipid
components (e.g., one or more of the compounds disclosed herein) with one or more polymer
components. For example, a lipid nanoparticle may be prepared using HGT5000, DOPE,
CHOL and DMG-PEG2000. A lipid nanoparticle may be comprised of additional lipid
combinations in various ratios, including for example, HGT5001, DOPE and DMG
PEG2000. The selection of cationic lipids, non-cationic lipids and/or PEG-modified lipids
which comprise the lipid nanoparticles, as well as the relative molar ratio of such lipids to
each other, is based upon the characteristics of the selected lipid(s), the nature of the intended
target cells or tissues and the characteristics of the materials or polynucleotides to be
delivered by the lipid nanoparticle. Additional considerations include, for example, the
saturation of the alkyl chain, as well as the size, charge, pH, pKa, fusogenicity and toxicity of
the selected lipid(s).
[0103]           The pharmaceutical and liposomal composition (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) for
use in the present invention can be prepared by various techniques which are presently known
in the art. Multi-lamellar vesicles (MLV) may be prepared conventional techniques, for
example, by depositing a selected lipid on the inside wall of a suitable container or vessel by
dissolving the lipid in an appropriate solvent, and then evaporating the solvent to leave a thin
film on the inside of the vessel or by spray drying. An aqueous phase may then added to the
vessel with a vortexing motion which results in the formation of MLVs. Unilamellar vesicles
                                                 34

 WO 2013/149140                                                                PCT/US2013/034602
(ULV) can then be formed by homogenization, sonication or extrusion of the multi-lamellar
vesicles. In addition, unilamellar vesicles can be formed by detergent removal techniques.
[0104]           In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions of the
present invention comprise a lipid nanoparticle wherein the encapsulated polynucleotide
(e.g., mRNA) is associated on both the surface of the lipid nanoparticle and encapsulated
within the same lipid nanoparticle. For example, during preparation of the compositions of
the present invention, one or more of the cationic lipid compounds described herein and
which comprise the lipid nanoparticles may associate with the polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA)
through electrostatic interactions with such polynucleotides.
[0105]           In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions of the
present invention may be loaded with diagnostic radionuclide, fluorescent materials or other
materials that are detectable in both in vitro and in vivo applications. For example, suitable
diagnostic materials for use in the present invention may include Rhodamine
dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (Rh-PE), Green Fluorescent Protein mRNA, Renilla
Luciferase mRNA and Firefly Luciferase mRNA.
[0106]           During the preparation of liposomal compositions described herein, water
soluble carrier agents may be also encapsulated in the aqueous interior by including them in
the hydrating solution, and lipophilic molecules may be incorporated into the lipid bilayer by
inclusion in the lipid formulation. In the case of certain molecules (e.g., cationic or anionic
lipophilic polynucleotides), loading of the polynucleotide into preformed lipid nanoparticles
or liposomes may be accomplished, for example, by the methods described in U.S. Pat. No.
4,946,683, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Following
encapsulation of the polynucleotide, the lipid nanoparticles may be processed to remove un
encapsulated mRNA through processes such as gel chromatography, diafiltration or
ultrafiltration. For example, if it is desirous to remove externally bound polynucleotide from
the surface of the liposomal compositions (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) described herein, such
lipid nanoparticles may be subject to a Diethylaminoethyl SEPHACEL column.
[0107]           In addition to the encapsulated materials (e.g., polynucleotides or one or more
therapeutic or diagnostic agents) may be included or encapsulated in the lipid nanoparticle.
For example, such additional therapeutic agents may be associated with the surface of the
lipid nanoparticle, can be incorporated into the lipid bilayer of the lipid nanoparticle by
                                                 35

 WO 2013/149140                                                                PCT/US2013/034602
inclusion in the lipid formulation or loading into preformed lipid nanoparticles (See, U.S. Pat.
Nos. 5,194,654 and 5,223,263, which are incorporated by reference herein).
[0108]           There are several methods for reducing the size, or "sizing", of the liposomal
compositions (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) disclosed herein, and any of these methods may
generally be employed when sizing is used as part of the invention. The extrusion method is a
one method of liposome sizing. (Hope, M J et al. Reduction of Liposome Size and
Preparation of Unilamellar Vesicles by Extrusion Techniques. In: Liposome Technology (G.
Gregoriadis, Ed.) Vol. 1. p 123 (1993)). The method consists of extruding liposomes through
a small-pore polycarbonate membrane or an asymmetric ceramic membrane to reduce
liposome sizes to a relatively well-defined size distribution. Typically, the suspension is
cycled through the membrane one or more times until the desired liposome size distribution is
achieved. The liposomes may be extruded through successively smaller pore membranes to
achieve gradual reduction in liposome size.
[0109]           A variety of alternative methods known in the art are available for sizing of a
population of lipid nanoparticles. One such sizing method is described in U.S. Pat. No.
4,737,323, incorporated herein by reference. Sonicating a liposome or lipid nanoparticle
suspension either by bath or probe sonication produces a progressive size reduction down to
small ULV less than about 0.05 microns in diameter. Homogenization is another method that
relies on shearing energy to fragment large liposomes into smaller ones. In a typical
homogenization procedure, MLV are recirculated through a standard emulsion homogenizer
until selected liposome sizes, typically between about 0.1 and 0.5 microns, are observed. The
size of the lipid nanoparticles may be determined by quasi-electric light scattering (QELS) as
described in Bloomfield, Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng., 10:421-450 (1981), incorporated
herein by reference. Average lipid nanoparticle diameter may be reduced by sonication of
formed lipid nanoparticles. Intermittent sonication cycles may be alternated with QELS
assessment to guide efficient liposome synthesis.
[0110]           Selection of the appropriate size of the liposomal compositions described
herein (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) must take into consideration the site of the target cell or
tissue and to some extent the application for which the lipid nanoparticle is being made. As
used herein, the phrase "target cell" refers to cells to which one or more of the
pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions described herein are to be directed or targeted.
In some embodiments, the target cells comprise a particular tissue or organ. In some

 WO 2013/149140                                                                    PCT/US2013/034602
embodiments, the target cells are deficient in a protein or enzyme of interest. For example,
where it is desired to deliver a polynucleotide to a hepatocyte, the hepatocyte represents the
target cell. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical or liposomal compositions (and for
example the polynucleotide materials encapsulated therein) of the present invention transfect
the target cells on a discriminatory basis (i.e., do not transfect non-target cells). The
compositions and methods of the present invention may be prepared to preferentially target a
variety of target cells, which include, but are not limited to, hepatocytes, hematopoietic cells,
epithelial cells, endothelial cells, lung cells, alveolar cells, bone cells, stem cells,
mesenchymal cells, neural cells (e.g., meninges, astrocytes, motor neurons, cells of the dorsal
root ganglia and anterior horn motor neurons), photoreceptor cells (e.g., rods and cones),
retinal pigmented epithelial cells, secretory cells, cardiac cells, adipocytes, vascular smooth
muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, skeletal muscle cells, beta cells, pituitary cells, synovial lining
cells, ovarian cells, testicular cells, fibroblasts, B cells, T cells, reticulocytes, leukocytes,
granulocytes and tumor cells.
[0111]           Following transfection of one or more target cells by, for example, the
polynucleotides encapsulated in the one or more lipid nanoparticles comprising the
pharmaceutical or liposomal compositions disclosed herein, the production of the product
(e.g., a polypeptide or protein) encoded by such polynucleotide may be preferably stimulated
and the capability of such target cells to express the polynucleotide and produce, for example,
a polypeptide or protein of interest is enhanced. For example, transfection of a target cell by
one or more compounds or pharmaceutical compositions encapsulating mRNA will enhance
(i.e., increase) the production of the protein or enzyme encoded by such mRNA.
[0112]           In some embodiments, it may be desirable to limit transfection of the
polynucleotides to certain cells or tissues. For example, the liver represents an important
target organ for the compositions of the present invention in part due to its central role in
metabolism and production of proteins and accordingly diseases which are caused by defects
in liver-specific gene products (e.g., the urea cycle disorders) may benefit from specific
targeting of cells (e.g., hepatocytes). Accordingly, in certain embodiments of the present
invention, the structural characteristics of the target tissue may be exploited to direct the
distribution of the pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions of the present invention (e.g.,
an HGT500 1-based lipid nanoparticle) to such target tissues. For example, to target
hepatocytes one or more of the lipid nanoparticles that comprise the pharmaceutical or
liposomal compositions described herein may be sized such that their dimensions are smaller
                                                  37

 WO 2013/149140                                                                 PCT/US2013/034602
than the fenestrations of the endothelial layer lining hepatic sinusoids in the liver; accordingly
the one or more of such lipid nanoparticles can readily penetrate such endothelial
fenestrations to reach the target hepatocytes. Alternatively, a lipid nanoparticle may be sized
such that the dimensions of the liposome are of a sufficient diameter to limit or expressly
avoid distribution into certain cells or tissues. For example, lipid nanoparticles that comprise
the pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions described herein may be sized such that their
dimensions are larger than the fenestrations of the endothelial layer lining hepatic sinusoids
to thereby limit distribution of the liposomal lipid nanoparticle to hepatocytes. In such an
embodiment, large liposomal compositions (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) will not easily penetrate
the endothelial fenestrations, and would instead be cleared by the macrophage Kupffer cells
that line the liver sinusoids. Sizing of, for example, the lipid nanoparticles comprising the
pharmaceutical composition may therefore provide an opportunity to further manipulate and
precisely control the degree to which expression of the encapsulated polynucleotides may be
enhanced in one or more target cells. Generally, the size of at least one of the lipid
nanoparticles that comprise the pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions of the present
invention is within the range of about 25 to 250 nm, preferably less than about 250nm,
 175nm, 150nm, 125nm, 100nm, 75nm, 50nm, 25nm or l0nm.
[0113]           Similarly, the compositions of the present invention may be prepared to
preferentially distribute to other target tissues, cells or organs, such as the heart, lungs,
kidneys, spleen. For example, the lipid nanoparticles of the present invention may be
prepared to achieve enhanced delivery to the target cells and tissues. Accordingly, the
compositions of the present invention may be enriched with additional cationic, non-cationic
and PEG-modified lipids to further target tissues or cells.
[0114]           In some embodiments, the compounds and the pharmaceutical and liposomal
compositions described herein (e.g., HGT5002-based lipid nanoparticles) distribute to the
cells and tissues of the liver to enhance the delivery, transfection and the subsequent
expression of the polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) encapsulated therein by the cells and tissues
of the liver (e.g., hepatocytes) and the corresponding production of the polypeptide or protein
encoded by such polynucleotide. While such compositions may preferentially distribute into
the cells and tissues of the liver, the therapeutic effects of the expressed polynucleotides and
the subsequent production of a protein encoded thereby need not be limited to the target cells
and tissues. For example, the targeted cells (e.g., hepatocytes) may function as a "reservoir"
or "depot" capable of expressing or producing, and systemically or peripherally excreting a
                                                 38

 WO 2013/149140                                                               PCT/US2013/034602
functional protein or enzyme, as disclosed for example, in International Application No.
PCT/US2010/05 8457 (Attorney Docket No. SHIR-004-WO1) and in United States
Provisional Application No. 61/494,881 (Attorney Docket No. SHIR-025-00 1), the teachings
of which are both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Accordingly, in certain
embodiments of the present invention the one or more of the lipid nanoparticles that comprise
the pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions described herein (e.g., HGT5000-based lipid
nanoparticles) may target hepatocytes and/or preferentially distribute to the cells and tissues
of the liver upon delivery. Following the transfection of the target hepatocytes by the
polynucleotide encapsulated in one or more of such lipid nanoparticles, such polynucleotides
are expressed (e.g., translated) and a functional product (e.g., a polypeptide or protein) is
excreted and systemically distributed, where such functional product may exert a desired
therapeutic effect.
[0115]           The polynucleotides encapsulated in one or more of the compounds or
pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions described herein can be delivered to and/or
transfect targeted cells or tissues. In some embodiments, the encapsulated polynucleotides
are capable of being expressed and functional polypeptide products produced (and in some
instances excreted) by the target cell, thereby conferring a beneficial property to, for example
the target cells or tissues. Such encapsulated polynucleotides may encode, for example, a
hormone, enzyme, receptor, polypeptide, peptide or other protein of interest. In certain
embodiments, such encapsulated polynucleotides may also encode a small interfering RNA
(siRNA) or antisense RNA for the purpose of modulating or otherwise decreasing or
eliminating the expression of an endogenous nucleic acid or gene. In certain embodiments
such encapsulated polynucleotides may be natural or recombinant in nature and may exert
their therapeutic activity using either sense or antisense mechanisms of action (e.g., by
modulating the expression of a target gene or nucleic acid).
[0116]           Also contemplated by the present invention is the co-delivery of one or more
unique polynucleotides to target cells by the compounds or pharmaceutical and liposomal
compositions described herein, for example, by combining two unique therapeutic agents or
polynucleotides into a single lipid nanoparticle. Also contemplated is the delivery of one or
more encapsulated polynucleotides to one or more target cells to treat a single disorder or
deficiency, wherein each such polynucleotide functions by a different mechanism of action.
For example, the pharmaceutical or liposomal compositions of the present invention may
comprise a first polynucleotide which, for example, is encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle
                                               39

 WO 2013/149140                                                                PCT/US2013/034602
and intended to correct an endogenous protein or enzyme deficiency, and a second
polynucleotide intended to deactivate or "knock-down" a malfunctioning endogenous
polynucleotide and its protein or enzyme product. Such encapsulated polynucleotides may
encode, for example mRNA and siRNA.
[0117]           While in vitro transcribed polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) may be transfected
into target cells, such polynucleotides may be readily and efficiently degraded by the cell in
vivo, thus rendering such polynucleotides ineffective. Moreover, some polynucleotides are
unstable in bodily fluids (particularly human serum) and can be degraded or digested even
before reaching a target cell. In addition, within a cell, a natural mRNA can decay with a
half-life of between 30 minutes and several days. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the
encapsulated polynucleotides provided herein, and in particular the mRNA polynucleotides
provided herein, preferably retain at least some ability to be expressed or translated, to
thereby produce a functional protein or enzyme within one or more target cells.
[0118]           In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions
comprise one or more of the lipid compounds disclosed herein and one or more lipid
nanoparticles that include or encapsulate one or more stabilized polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA
which has been stabilized against in vivo nuclease digestion or degradation) that modulate the
expression of a gene or that may be expressed or translated to produce a functional
polypeptide or protein within one or more target cells. In certain embodiments, the activity
of such encapsulated polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA encoding a functional protein or enzyme)
is prolonged over an extended period of time. For example, the activity of the
polynucleotides may be prolonged such that the pharmaceutical compositions may be
administered to a subject on a semi-weekly or bi-weekly basis, or more preferably on a
monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly or an annual basis. The extended or prolonged activity of the
pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, and in particular of the encapsulated
mRNA, is directly related to the quantity of functional protein or enzyme translated from
such mRNA. Similarly, the activity of the compositions of the present invention may be
further extended or prolonged by chemical modifications made to further improve or enhance
translation of the mRNA polynucleotides. For example, the Kozac consensus sequence plays
a role in the initiation of protein translation, and the inclusion of such a Kozac consensus
sequence in the encapsulated mRNA polynucleotides may further extend or prolong the
activity of the mRNA polynucleotides. Furthermore, the quantity of functional protein or
enzyme produced by the target cell is a function of the quantity of polynucleotide (e.g.,
                                                  40

 WO 2013/149140                                                                 PCT/US2013/034602
mRNA) delivered to the target cells and the stability of such polynucleotide. To the extent
that the stability of the polynucleotides encapsulated by the compounds or compositions of
the present invention may be improved or enhanced, the half-life, the activity of the translated
protein or enzyme and the dosing frequency of the composition may be further extended.
[0119]           In certain embodiments the polynucleotides can be chemically modified for
example, to confer stability (e.g., stability relative to the wild-type or naturally-occurring
version of the mRNA and/or the version of the mRNA naturally endogenous to target cells).
Accordingly, in some embodiments, the encapsulated polynucleotides provided herein
comprise at least one chemical modification which confers increased or enhanced stability to
the polynucleotide, including, for example, improved resistance to nuclease digestion in vivo.
The terms "stable" and "stability" as such terms relate to the polynucleotides encapsulated by
the compounds or pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions of the present invention, and
particularly with respect to the mRNA, refer to increased or enhanced resistance to
degradation by, for example nucleases (i.e., endonucleases or exonucleases) which are
normally capable of degrading such RNA. Increased stability can include, for example, less
sensitivity to hydrolysis or other destruction by endogenous enzymes (e.g., endonucleases or
exonucleases) or conditions within the target cell or tissue, thereby increasing or enhancing
the residence of such polynucleotides in the target cell, tissue, subject and/or cytoplasm. The
stabilized polynucleotide molecules provided herein demonstrate longer half-lives relative to
their naturally occurring, unmodified counterparts (e.g. the wild-type version of the
polynucleotide).
[0120]           In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide can be modified by the
incorporation 3' and/or 5' untranslated (UTR) sequences which are not naturally found in the
wild-type polynucleotide. Also contemplated by the phrases "chemical modification" and
"chemically modified" as such terms related to the polynucleotides encapsulated by the
compounds or pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions of the present invention are
alterations which improve or enhance translation of mRNA polynucleotides, including for
example, the inclusion of sequences which function in the initiation of protein translation
(e.g., the Kozac consensus sequence). (Kozak, M., Nucleic Acids Res 15 (20): 8125-48
(1987)). Chemical modifications also include modifications which introduce chemistries
which differ from those seen in naturally occurring polynucleotides, for example, covalent
modifications such as the introduction of modified nucleotides, (e.g., nucleotide analogs, or
the inclusion of pendant groups which are not naturally found in such polynucleotide
                                                 41

 WO 2013/149140                                                                  PCT/US2013/034602
molecules). In some embodiments, the polynucleotides have undergone a chemical or
biological modification to render them more stable prior to encapsulation in one or more lipid
nanoparticles. In certain embodiments, exemplary chemical modifications that may be
introduced into the polynucleotide include pseudouridine, 2-thiouracil, 5-methyl cytidine, 5
methylcytosine, isocytosine, pseudoisocytosine, 5-bromouracil, 5-propynyluracil, 6
aminopurine, 2-aminopurine, inosine, diaminopurine and 2-chloro-6-aminopurine cytosine.
Exemplary chemical modifications to a polynucleotide include the depletion of a base (e.g.,
by deletion or by the substitution of one nucleotide for another) or chemical modification of a
base.
[0121]             In addition, suitable modifications include alterations in one or more
nucleotides of a codon such that the codon encodes the same amino acid but is more stable
than the codon found in the wild-type version of the polynucleotide. For example, an inverse
relationship between the stability of RNA and a higher number cytidines (C's) and/or uridines
(U's) residues has been demonstrated, and RNA devoid of C and U residues have been found
to be stable to most RNases (Heidenreich, et al. J Biol Chem 269, 2131-8 (1994)).         In some
embodiments, the number of C and/or U residues in an mRNA sequence is reduced. In a
another embodiment, the number of C and/or U residues is reduced by substitution of one
codon encoding a particular amino acid for another codon encoding the same or a related
amino acid. Contemplated modifications to the mRNA polynucleotides encapsulated by the
compounds or pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions of the present invention also
include the incorporation of pseudouridines. The incorporation of pseudouridines into the
mRNA polynucleotides encapsulated by the compounds or pharmaceutical and liposomal
compositions of the present invention may enhance stability and translational capacity, as
well as diminishing immunogenicity in vivo. (See, e.g., Karik6, K., et al., Molecular Therapy
 16 (11): 1833-1840 (2008)). Substitutions and modifications to the polynucleotides
encapsulated by the compounds or pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions of the present
invention may be performed by methods readily known to one or ordinary skill in the art.
[0122]             The constraints on reducing the number of C and U residues in a sequence will
likely be greater within the coding region of an mRNA, compared to an untranslated region,
(i.e., it will likely not be possible to eliminate all of the C and U residues present in the
message while still retaining the ability of the message to encode the desired amino acid
sequence). The degeneracy of the genetic code, however presents an opportunity to allow the
number of C and/or U residues that are present in the sequence to be reduced, while
                                                  42

 WO 2013/149140                                                               PCT/US2013/034602
maintaining the same coding capacity (i.e., depending on which amino acid is encoded by a
codon, several different possibilities for modification of RNA sequences may be possible).
For example, the codons for Gly can be altered to GGA or GGG instead of GGU or GGC.
[01231           The term chemical modification also includes, for example, the incorporation
of non-nucleotide linkages or modified nucleotides into the polynucleotide sequences of the
present invention (e.g., end-blocking modifications to one or both the 3' and 5' ends of an
mRNA molecule encoding a functional protein or enzyme). Such modifications may include
the addition of bases to a polynucleotide sequence (e.g., the inclusion of a poly A tail or a
longer poly A tail), the alteration of the 3' UTR or the 5' UTR, complexing the polynucleotide
with an agent (e.g., a protein or a complementary polynucleotide molecule), and inclusion of
elements which change the structure of a polynucleotide molecule (e.g., which form
secondary structures).
[0124]           The poly A tail is thought to stabilize natural messengers and synthetic sense
RNA. Therefore, in certain embodiments a long poly A tail can be added to an mRNA
molecule thus rendering the RNA more stable. Poly A tails can be added using a variety of
art-recognized techniques. For example, long poly A tails can be added to synthetic or in
vitro transcribed RNA using poly A polymerase (Yokoe, et al. Nature Biotechnology. 1996;
 14: 1252-1256). A transcription vector can also encode long poly A tails. In addition, poly A
tails can be added by transcription directly from PCR products. Poly A may also be ligated to
the 3' end of a sense RNA with RNA ligase (see, e.g., Molecular Cloning A Laboratory
Manual, 2nd Ed., ed. by Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
Press: 1991 edition)). In certain embodiments, the length of the poly A tail is at least about
90, 200, 300, 400 at least 500 nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the length of the poly A
tail is adjusted to control the stability of a modified sense mRNA molecule of the invention
and, thus, the transcription of protein. For example, since the length of the poly A tail can
influence the half-life of a sense mRNA molecule, the length of the poly A tail can be
adjusted to modify the level of resistance of the mRNA to nucleases and thereby control the
time course of polynucleotide expression and protein production in a target cell. In certain
embodiments, the stabilized polynucleotide molecules are sufficiently resistant to in vivo
degradation (e.g., by nucleases), such that they may be delivered to the target cell without a
lipid nanoparticle.
                                                 43

 WO 2013/149140                                                               PCT/US2013/034602
[01251           In some embodiments, the encapsulated polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA
encoding a deficient protein) may optionally include chemical or biological modifications
which, for example, improve the stability and/or half-life of such polynucleotide or which
improve or otherwise facilitate translation of such polynucleotide.
[0126]           In certain embodiments, the chemical modifications are end-blocking
modification of the one or more polynucleotides which comprise the pharmaceutical
compositions of the invention. For example, such polynucleotides can be modified by the
incorporation 3' and/or 5' untranslated (UTR) sequences which are not naturally found in the
wild-type polynucleotide. In certain embodiments, 3' and/or 5' flanking sequence which
naturally flanks an mRNA and encodes a second, unrelated protein can be incorporated into
the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA molecule encoding a or functional protein in order to
modify it. For example, 3' or 5' sequences from mRNA molecules which are stable (e.g.,
globin, actin, GAPDH, tubulin, histone, or citric acid cycle enzymes) can be incorporated into
the 3' and/or 5' region of a sense mRNA polynucleotide molecule to increase the stability of
the sense mRNA molecule.
[0127]           Also contemplated by the present invention are modifications to the
polynucleotide sequences made to one or both of the 3' and 5' ends of the polynucleotide.
For example, the present invention contemplates modifications to the 5' end of the
polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) to include a partial sequence of a CMV immediate-early 1
(IEl) gene, or a fragment thereof to improve the nuclease resistance and/or improve the half
life of the polynucleotide. In addition to increasing the stability of the mRNA polynucleotide
sequence, it has been surprisingly discovered the inclusion of a partial sequence of a CMV
immediate-early 1 (IEl) gene (e.g., to one or more of the 5' untranslated region and 3'
untranslated region of the mRNA) further enhances the translation of the mRNA. Also
contemplated is the inclusion of a sequence encoding human growth hormone (hGH), or a
fragment thereof to one or both of the 3' and 5' ends of the polynucleotide (e.g., mRNA) to
further stabilize the polynucleotide. Generally, the contemplated chemical modifications
improve the stability and/or pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., half-life) of the polynucleotide
relative to their unmodified counterparts, and include, for example modifications made to
improve such polynucleotides' resistance to in vivo nuclease digestion.
[0128]           In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition, the two or more lipid
nanoparticles comprised therein or the polynucleotides encapsulated by such lipid
                                               44

 WO 2013/149140                                                               PCT/US2013/034602
nanoparticles can comprise a stabilizing reagent. The compositions can include one or more
formulation reagents that bind directly or indirectly to, and stabilize the polynucleotide,
thereby enhancing residence time in the cytoplasm of a target cell. Such reagents preferably
lead to an improved half-life of a polynucleotide in the target cells. For example, the stability
of an mRNA and efficiency of translation may be increased by the incorporation of
"stabilizing reagents" that form complexes with the polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) that
naturally occur within a cell (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,124). Incorporation of a stabilizing
reagent can be accomplished for example, by combining the poly A and a protein with the
mRNA to be stabilized in vitro before loading or encapsulating the mRNA within the one or
more lipid nanoparticles that comprise the pharmaceutical composition. Exemplary
stabilizing reagents include one or more proteins, peptides, aptamers, translational accessory
protein, mRNA binding proteins, and/or translation initiation factors.
[0129]           Stabilization of the pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions described
herein (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) may also be improved by the use of opsonization-inhibiting
moieties, which are typically large hydrophilic polymers that are chemically or physically
bound or otherwise incorporated into the lipid nanoparticle (e.g., by the intercalation of a
lipid-soluble anchor into the membrane itself, or by binding directly to active groups of
membrane lipids). These opsonization-inhibiting hydrophilic polymers form a protective
surface layer which significantly decreases the uptake of the liposomes by the macrophage
monocyte system and reticulo-endothelial system (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No.
4,920,016, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference). For example,
delays in the uptake of lipid nanoparticles by the reticuloendothelial system may be
facilitated by the addition of a hydrophilic polymer surface coating onto or into lipid
nanoparticles to mask the recognition and uptake of the liposomal-based lipid nanoparticle by
the reticuloendothelial system. For example, in certain embodiments, one or more of the
lipid nanoparticles that comprise the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein comprise
a polyethyleneglycol (PEG) polymer or a PEG-modified lipid to further enhance delivery of
such lipid nanoparticles to the target cell and tissues.
[0130]           When RNA is hybridized to a complementary polynucleotide molecule (e.g.,
DNA or RNA) it may be protected from nucleases. (Krieg, et al. Melton. Methods in
Enzymology. 1987; 155, 397-415). The stability of hybridized mRNA is likely due to the
inherent single strand specificity of most RNases. In some embodiments, the stabilizing
reagent selected to complex a polynucleotide is a eukaryotic protein, (e.g., a mammalian
                                                45

 WO 2013/149140                                                              PCT/US2013/034602
protein). In yet another embodiment, the polynucleotide (e.g., mRNA) for use in sense
therapy can be modified by hybridization to a second polynucleotide molecule. If an entire
mRNA molecule were hybridized to a complementary polynucleotide molecule translation
initiation may be reduced. In some embodiments the 5' untranslated region and the AUG
start region of the mRNA molecule may optionally be left unhybridized. Following
translation initiation, the unwinding activity of the ribosome complex can function even on
high affinity duplexes so that translation can proceed. (Liebhaber. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 2
 13; Monia, et al. J Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-22.) It will be understood that any of the
above described methods for enhancing the stability of polynucleotides may be used either
alone or in combination with one or more of any of the other above-described methods and/or
compositions.
[0131]           In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present
invention enhance the delivery of lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated polynucleotides to one or
more target cells, tissues or organs. In some embodiments, enhanced delivery to one or more
target cells comprises increasing the amount of polynucleotide that comes in contact or is
otherwise delivered to the target cells. In some embodiments, enhancing delivery to target
cells comprises reducing the amount of polynucleotide that comes into contact with non
target cells. In some embodiments, enhancing delivery to target cells comprises allowing the
transfection of at least some target cells with the encapsulated polynucleotide. In some
embodiments, the level of expression of the polynucleotide encapsulated by the lipid
nanoparticles which comprise the subject pharmaceutical compositions and the corresponding
production of the functional protein or enzyme encoded thereby is increased in the target
cells.
[0132]           The polynucleotides encapsulated by the compounds or pharmaceutical and
liposomal compositions of the present invention may be optionally combined with a reporter
gene (e.g., upstream or downstream of the coding region of the polynucleotide) which, for
example, facilitates the determination of polynucleotide delivery to the target cells or tissues.
Suitable reporter genes may include, for example, Green Fluorescent Protein mRNA (GFP
mRNA), Renilla Luciferase mRNA (Luciferase mRNA), Firefly Luciferase mRNA, or any
combinations thereof. For example, GFP mRNA may be fused with a polynucleotide
encoding GLA mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 4) or EPO mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 1) to facilitate
confirmation of mRNA localization in the plasma or in one or more target cells, tissues or
organs.

 WO 2013/149140                                                                PCT/US2013/034602
[01331           In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present
invention comprise one or more additional molecules (e.g., proteins, peptides, aptamers or
oliogonucleotides) which facilitate the transfer of the polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA, miRNA,
snRNA and snoRNA) from the lipid nanoparticle into an intracellular compartment of the
target cell. In some embodiments, the additional molecule facilitates the delivery of the
polynucleotides into, for example, the cytosol, the lysosome, the mitochondrion, the nucleus,
the nucleolae or the proteasome of a target cell. Also included are agents that facilitate the
transport of the translated protein of interest from the cytoplasm to its normal intercellular
location (e.g., in the mitochondrion) to treat deficiencies in that organelle. In some
embodiments, the agent is selected from the group consisting of a protein, a peptide, an
aptamer, and an oligonucleotide.
[0134]           In some embodiments, the compositions of the present invention facilitate a
subject's endogenous production of one or more functional proteins and/or enzymes, and in
particular the production of proteins and/or enzymes which demonstrate less immunogenicity
relative to their recombinantly-prepared counterparts. In a certain embodiments of the
present invention, the lipid nanoparticles comprise polynucleotides which encode mRNA of a
deficient protein or enzyme. Upon distribution of such compositions to the target tissues and
the subsequent transfection of such target cells, the exogenous mRNA loaded or encapsulated
into the lipid nanoparticles that comprise the compositions may be translated in vivo to
produce a functional protein or enzyme encoded by such encapsulated mRNA (e.g., a protein
or enzyme in which the subject is deficient). Accordingly, in certain embodiments the
compositions of the present invention exploit a subject's ability to translate exogenously- or
recombinantly-prepared mRNA to produce an endogenously-translated protein or enzyme,
and thereby produce (and where applicable excrete) a functional protein or enzyme. The
translated proteins or enzymes may also be characterized by the in vivo inclusion of native
post-translational modifications which may often be absent in recombinantly-prepared
proteins or enzymes, thereby further reducing the immunogenicity of the translated protein or
enzyme.
[0135]           The encapsulation of mRNA in the lipid nanoparticles and the administration
of the pharmaceutical compositions comprising such lipid nanoparticles avoid the need to
deliver the mRNA to specific organelles within a target cell (e.g., mitochondria). Rather,
upon transfection of a target cell and delivery of the encapsulated mRNA to the cytoplasm of
                                                 47

 WO 2013/149140                                                                PCT/US2013/034602
the target cell, the mRNA contents of the lipid nanoparticles may be translated and a
functional protein or enzyme produced.
[0136]           The present invention also contemplates the discriminatory targeting of one or
more target cells and tissues by both passive and active targeting means. The phenomenon of
passive targeting exploits the natural distributions patterns of lipid nanoparticles in vivo
without relying upon the use of additional excipients or means to enhance recognition of the
lipid nanoparticle by one or more target cells. For example, lipid nanoparticles which are
subject to phagocytosis by the cells of the reticulo-endothelial system are likely to
accumulate in the liver or spleen, and accordingly may provide means to passively direct the
delivery of the compositions to such target cells.
[0137]           Alternatively, the present invention contemplates active targeting, which
involves the use of additional excipients, referred to herein as "targeting ligands" that may be
bound (either covalently or non-covalently) to the lipid nanoparticle to encourage localization
of such lipid nanoparticle at certain target cells or target tissues. For example, targeting may
be mediated by the inclusion of one or more endogenous targeting ligands (e.g.,
apolipoprotein E) in or on the lipid nanoparticle to encourage distribution to the target cells or
tissues. Recognition of the targeting ligand by the target tissues actively facilitates tissue
distribution to, and cellular uptake of the lipid nanoparticles and/or their contents by the
target cells and tissues. For example, in certain embodiments, one or more of the lipid
nanoparticles that comprise the pharmaceutical formulation may comprise an apolipoprotein
E targeting ligand in or on such lipid nanoparticles to facilitate or encourage recognition and
binding of such lipid nanoparticle to endogenous low density lipoprotein receptors expressed,
for example by hepatocytes. As provided herein, the composition can comprise a ligand
capable of enhancing affinity of the compositions to one or more target cells. Targeting
ligands may be linked to the outer bilayer of the lipid nanoparticle during formulation or
post-formulation. These methods are well known in the art. In addition, some lipid
nanoparticles may comprise fusogenic polymers such as PEAA, hemagluttinin, other
lipopeptides (see U.S. Patent Application Ser. Nos. 08/835,28 1, and 60/083,294, which are
incorporated herein by reference) and other features useful for in vivo and/or intracellular
delivery. In other embodiments, the compositions of the present invention demonstrate
improved transfection efficacies, and/or demonstrate enhanced selectivity towards target cells
or tissues of interest. Contemplated therefore are compositions or lipid nanoparticles that
comprise one or more ligands (e.g., peptides, aptamers, oligonucleotides, a vitamin or other
                                                48

 WO 2013/149140                                                               PCT/US2013/034602
molecules) that are capable of enhancing the affinity of the compositions or their constituent
lipid nanoparticles and their polynucleotide contents to one or more target cells or tissues.
Suitable ligands may optionally be bound or linked to the surface of the lipid nanoparticle. In
some embodiments, the targeting ligand may span the surface of a lipid nanoparticle or be
encapsulated within the lipid nanoparticle. Suitable ligands are selected based upon their
physical, chemical or biological properties (e.g., selective affinity and/or recognition of target
cell surface markers or features.) Cell-specific target sites and their corresponding targeting
ligand can vary widely. Suitable targeting ligands are selected such that the unique
characteristics of a target cell are exploited, thus allowing the composition to discriminate
between target and non-target cells. For example, compositions of the present invention may
bear surface markers (e.g., apolipoprotein-B or apolipoprotein-E) that selectively enhance
recognition of, or affinity to hepatocytes (e.g., by receptor-mediated recognition of and
binding to such surface markers). Additionally, the use of galactose as a targeting ligand
would be expected to direct the compositions of the present invention to parenchymal
hepatocytes, or alternatively the use of mannose containing sugar residues as a targeting
ligand would be expected to direct the compositions of the present invention to liver
endothelial cells (e.g., mannose containing sugar residues that may bind preferentially to the
asialoglycoprotein receptor present in hepatocytes). (See Hillery AM, et al. "Drug Delivery
and Targeting: For Pharmacists and Pharmaceutical Scientists" (2002) Taylor & Francis,
Inc.) The presentation of such targeting ligands that have been conjugated to moieties
present in the lipid nanoparticle therefore facilitate recognition and uptake of the liposomal
compositions of the present invention by one or more target cells and tissues. Examples of
suitable targeting ligands include one or more peptides, proteins, aptamers, vitamins and
oligonucleotides.
[0138]          As used herein, the term "subject" refers to any animal (e.g., a mammal),
including, but not limited to, humans, non-human primates, rodents, and the like, to which the
compounds, pharmaceutical or liposomal compositions and methods of the present invention
may be administered. Typically, the terms "subject" and "patient" are used interchangeably
herein in reference to a human subject.
[0139]          The ability of the compounds and pharmaceutical or liposomal compositions
described herein (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) to modulate or enhance the expression of
encapsulated polynucleotides and the production of a polypeptide or protein provides novel
and more efficient means of effectuating the in vivo production of polypeptides and proteins

for the treatment of a host of diseases or pathological conditions. Such lipid nanoparticle
compositions are particularly suitable for the treatment of diseases or pathological conditions
associated with the aberrant expression of nucleic acids encoding a protein or enzyme. For
example, the successful delivery of polynucleotides such as mRNA to target organs such as
the liver and in particular, to hepatocytes, can be used for the treatment and the correction of
in-born errors of metabolism that are localized to the liver. Accordingly, the compounds,
pharmaceutical compositions and related methods described herein may be employed to treat
a wide range of diseases and pathological conditions, in particular those diseases which are
due to protein or enzyme deficiencies. The polynucleotides encapsulated by the compounds
or pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions described herein (e.g., HGT5001-based lipid
nanoparticles) may encode a functional product (e.g., a protein, enzyme, polypeptide, peptide,
functional RNA, and/or antisense molecule), and preferably encodes a product whose in vivo
production is desired.
[0140]          The compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and related methods of the
present invention are broadly applicable to the delivery of therapeutic agents such as
polynucleotides, and in particular mRNA, to treat a number of disorders. In particular, such
compounds, compositions and related methods of the present invention are suitable for the
treatment of diseases or disorders relating to the deficiency of proteins and/or enzymes. In
certain embodiments, the lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated polynucleotides encode functional
proteins or enzymes that are excreted or secreted by one or more target cells into the
surrounding extracellular fluid (e.g., mRNA encoding hormones and neurotransmitters).
Alternatively, in another embodiment, the polynucleotides encapsulated by the compounds or
pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions of the present invention encode functional
proteins or enzymes that remain in the cytosol of one or more target cells (e.g., mRNA
encoding an enzyme associated with urea cycle or lysosomal storage metabolic disorders).
Other disorders for which the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and related methods
of the present invention are useful include, but are not limited to, disorders such as SMN1

[0142]          The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be
administered to a subject. In some embodiments, the compositions are formulated in
combination with one or more additional polynucleotides, carriers, targeting ligands or
stabilizing reagents or other suitable excipients. Techniques for formulation and
administration of drugs may be found in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences," Mack
Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., latest edition.
[0143]          The compounds and the pharmaceutical and liposomal compositions (e.g.,
lipid nanoparticles) of the present invention may be administered and dosed in accordance
with current medical practice, taking into account the clinical condition of the subject, the
nature of the encapsulated materials, the site and method of administration, the scheduling of
administration, the subject's age, sex, body weight and other factors relevant to clinicians of
ordinary skill in the art. The "effective amount" for the purposes herein may be determined
by such relevant considerations as are known to those of ordinary skill in experimental
clinical research, pharmacological, clinical and medical arts. In some embodiments, the
amount administered is effective to achieve at least some stabilization, improvement or
elimination of symptoms and other indicators as are selected as appropriate measures of
disease progress, regression or improvement by those of skill in the art. For example, a
suitable amount and dosing regimen is one that causes at least transient expression of the one
or more polynucleotides in the target cells.
[0144]          Suitable routes of administration of the compounds and pharmaceutical
compositions disclosed herein include, for example, oral, rectal, vaginal, transmucosal, or
intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous,
intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, intracerebroventricular, direct
intraventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections or infusions.

In certain embodiments, the administration of the compounds or compositions (e.g., lipid
nanoparticle) described herein to a subject facilitates the contacting of such compounds or
compositions to one or more target cells, tissues or organs.
[0145]          Alternately, the compounds and compositions of the present invention may be
administered in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection or infusion of
the pharmaceutical compositions directly into a targeted tissue, preferably in a depot or
sustained release formulation, such that the contacting of the targeted cells with the
constituent lipid nanoparticles may be further facilitated. Local delivery can be affected in
various ways, depending on the tissue to be targeted. For example, aerosols containing
compositions of the present invention can be inhaled (for nasal, tracheal, or bronchial
delivery); compositions of the present invention can be injected into the site of injury, disease
manifestation, or pain, for example; compositions can be provided in lozenges for oral,
tracheal, or esophageal application; can be supplied in liquid, tablet or capsule form for
administration to the stomach or intestines, can be supplied in suppository form for rectal or
vaginal application; or can even be delivered to the eye by use of creams, drops, or even
injection. Formulations containing the compounds of the present invention complexed with
therapeutic molecules or ligands can even be surgically administered, for example in
association with a polymer or other structure or substance that can allow the compositions to
diffuse from the site of implantation to surrounding cells. Alternatively, such compositions
can be applied surgically without the use of polymers or supports.
[0146]          Also contemplated herein are lyophilized pharmaceutical compositions
comprising one or more of the compounds disclosed herein and related methods for the use of
such lyophilized compositions as disclosed for example, in United States Provisional

formulated such that they are suitable for extended-release of the, for example,
polynucleotides or nucleic acids encapsulated therein. Such extended-release compositions
may be conveniently administered to a subject at extended dosing intervals. For example, in
certain embodiments, the compositions of the present invention are administered to a subject
twice day, daily or every other day. In a certain embodiments, the compositions of the
present invention are administered to a subject twice a week, once a week, every ten days,

[01641          The intermediate compound (4-Bromobutyl)triphenylphosphoniumbromide
(compound (12)) depicted in Reaction 3 above was prepared by placing lOg (46.3mmol) of
 1,4-dibromobutane (compound (11)) and 12. lg PPh 3 (46.3 mmol) in dry toluene (74mL), and
the mixture heated to reflux and boiled overnight. The solid that formed was filtered, washed
with toluene and dried under vacuum to provide the product compound (12) as a white solid.

[0165           The intermediate compound (4-Dimethylaminobutyl)triphenylphosphonium
bromide (compound (14)) was then prepared by adding 3g (6.28mmol, 1 eq.) of compound
(12) portionwise to a solution of 2M dimethylamine in THF (31.4 mL, 62.8mmol, 10 eq.) at
 0 C under N 2. The resulting suspension was allowed to stir at room temperature for 4 hours.
CH 3CN (35mL) was then added to this suspension and it was further stirred at room
temperature overnight. Nitrogen gas was then bubbled into the reaction mixture to remove
excess dimethylamine and solvents. The resulting solid was dried under high vacuum and
provided the dry product compound (13) as a light yellow solid. Yield: 3.16g (96%). The
product compound (13) was stirred with saturated aqueous NaHCO 3 (1 OmL) for 15 minutes
and lyophilized to produce a light yellow solid. This solid was stirred with chloroform and
filtered. The filtrate was dried over MgSO 4 , filtered, concentrated and the residue dried
under high vacuum at 45 C to produce the product compound (14) as a light pink solid.

cooled to -78 C. KHMDS (IM in THF, 1.32mL, 1.32mmol, 1.5 eq.) was then added
dropwise to the reaction flask and resulted in a yellowish orange cloudy solution. This
solution was stirred at -78 C for 45 minutes. The cooling bath was removed and the reaction
stirred at room temperature for 15 minutes to give a reddish orange solution. The mixture
was cooled again to -78 C and a solution of intermediate compound (10) (0.47g, 0.88mmol)
in dry THF (13mL) was added through a cannula. The reaction mixture color changed to
light yellow. The reaction mixture was stirred at -78 C for 45 minutes and then the cooling
bath was removed, stirring was continued at room temperature for an additional 30 minutes.
The mixture was cooled again to -20 C and then quenched with water (7mL). The reaction
mixture was diluted with ether and stirred for 10 minutes. The organic layer was separated,
washed with brine, dried over MgSO 4 , filtered, concentrated and the residue purified by

Example 7
[0181]          To determine whether the HGT5000-based lipid nanoparticles encapsulating
human GLA mRNA and prepared in accordance with Example 4 above were capable of
delivering encapsulated polynucleotide constructs to one or more target cells, a dose response
study was conducted in wild type (CD-1) mice that were subsequently monitored for human
GLA protein production.
[0182]          The foregoing studies were performed using male or female CD-I mice of
approximately 6-8 weeks of age at the beginning of each experiment. Samples were
introduced over a one week period at day 1 and again at day 5 by a single bolus tail-vein
injection. The serum concentrations of GLA protein were determined at six hours, twenty
four hours, forty-eight hours and seventy-two hours following the administration of the
second intravenous dose. Mice were sacrificed seventy-two hours following the
administration of the second intravenous dose on day eight and organs were perfused with
saline. The liver, spleen and when applicable, the brain, of each mouse was harvested,
apportioned into two parts and stored in either 10% neutral buffered formalin or snap-frozen
and stored at 80' C.
[0183]          As illustrated in FIG. 1, following the intravenous injection of two lOpg,
20pg, 30pg, 60pg or 90pg doses of GLA mRNA loaded in the HGT5000-based lipid

within 6 hours. Furthermore, detectable levels of GLA protein could be observed in the
serum 48 hours following intravenous administration of the second single dose. As
illustrated in FIG. 2, nanogram levels of human GLA protein were also detectable in select
organs of the mice, such as the liver, kidney and spleen 72 hours following the administration
of the second bolus tail-vein injection of GLA mRNA.
[0184]           Additional studies evaluating the HGT5000-based lipid nanoparticles
encapsulating human GLA mRNA and prepared in accordance with Example 4 above were
also performed using a murine model of Fabry disease. Samples were introduced by a single
bolus 90pg dose (based on encapsulated GLA) of the GLA-loaded lipid nanoparticle via a
tail-vein injection. Supraphysiological levels of GLA protein (approximately 50 times
higher) were detected in the serum 24 hours post-administration of the single 90ug dose of
GLA. As illustrated in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, human GLA protein was detectable in the serum
and in select organs of the Fabry mice following the administration of a bolus tail-vein
injection of the HGT5000-based lipid nanoparticle encapsulating GLA mRNA. In particular,
human GLA protein was detected in the serum of the Fabry mice following administration of
the GLA mRNA-loaded HGT5000-based lipid nanoparticles over a 72 hour time period.
Human GLA protein levels were also detectable in select Fabry mouse organs following the
administration of the GLA mRNA-loaded HGT5000-based lipid nanoparticles both at 24
hours and 72 hours post-administration.
Example 8
[0185]           To determine whether the HGT500 1-based lipid nanoparticles encapsulating
human GLA mRNA and prepared in accordance with Example 5 above were capable of
delivering encapsulated polynucleotide constructs to one or more target cells, a dose response
study was conducted in wild type (CD-1) mice that were subsequently monitored for human
GLA protein production.
[0186]           The foregoing studies were performed using male or female CD-I mice of
approximately 6-8 weeks of age at the beginning of each experiment. Samples were
introduced by a single bolus tail-vein injection. Mice were sacrificed at designated time
points and organs were perfused with saline. The liver, spleen and when applicable, the
brain, of each mouse was harvested, apportioned into two parts and stored in either 10%
neutral buffered formalin or snap-frozen and stored at -80'C.

[01871          The a single 30pg dose of the HGT50001-based GLA mRNA-loaded lipid
nanoparticles were administered to the wild type mice, and as illustrated in FIG. 5 at 6 hours
post-administration, human GLA protein was detected in serum at concentrations that
exceeded normal physiological levels by 100-fold. As also depicted in FIG. 5, twenty-four
hours following administration of the HGT500 1-based GLA mRNA-loaded lipid
nanoparticles to the wild type mice, human GLA protein remained detectable at
concentrations that exceeded normal physiological concentrations by 30-fold higher. Further,
as depicted in FIG. 6, substantial concentrations of human GLA protein could be detected in
the liver, kidney and spleen of the wild-type mice after treatment twenty-four hours post
administration of the HGT500 1-based GLA mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles.
Example 9
[0188]          The instant study was conducted to further demonstrate the ability of both the
HGT5000-based and the HGT500 1-based lipid nanoparticles to deliver encapsulated human
erythropoietin (EPO) mRNA to one or more target cells in wild-type Sprague Dawley rats.
HGT5000 and HGT50001-based EPO mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles were prepared in
accordance with the protocols set forth in the foregoing examples. Samples were
administered by a single bolus tail-vein injection. The concentration of EPO protein secreted
into the bloodstream was monitored over a twenty-four hour time period, with serum samples
obtained at six, twelve, eighteen and twenty-four hours following administration.
[0189]          Human EPO protein was detected in the Sprague-Dawley rat serum following
administration of the EPO mRNA-loaded HGT5000- and HGT5001-based lipid nanoparticles
over a twenty-four hour time period. As shown in FIG. 7, both HGT5000-based and
HGT5001-based lipid nanoparticles resulted in efficacious protein production in the wild
type Sprague Dawley rats. Significant levels of human EPO protein were detected over the
course of this study for both HGT5000 and HGT5001-based nanoparticle systems.
Accordingly, the present example illustrates that both HGT5000- and HGT500 1-based lipid
nanoparticles provide highly efficacious means of delivering polynucleotide constructs to one
or more target cells and that following expression of such lipid nanoparticles to such target
cells, the expressed protein encoded by the encapsulated mRNA was detectable in serum.

Discussion
[0190]           The foregoing studies illustrate that the lipid compounds disclosed herein are
useful as liposomal delivery vehicles or as components of liposomal delivery vehicles. In
particular, such compounds and compositions facilitate the delivery encapsulated
polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA polynucleotides encoding functional proteins or enzymes) to
one or more target cells, tissues and organs, thereby causing such cells to express the
encapsulated polynucleotide. For example, following a single intravenous injection of a
given dose of an mRNA polynucleotide encapsulated in an HGT5000-based lipid
nanoparticle, a substantial concentration of the encoded protein was detected in both serum
and in one or more target organs of the subject mice. Furthermore, as evident by Example 8,
in many instances the concentration of expressed protein well exceeded those concentrations
necessary for therapeutic efficacy, therefore suggesting that only a fraction of the
administered dose of the compositions are necessary to achieve therapeutically effective
concentrations within the plasma, target organ, tissue or cells. As a result, the total
administered amount of cationic lipid that is necessary to deliver a therapeutically effective
amount of the encapsulated agent may be reduced, resulting in a corresponding reduction in
the toxicity of the compositions.
