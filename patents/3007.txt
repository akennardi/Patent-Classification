   [0001]      This application is a divisional application of Australian Application No. 2015264854,

                                 INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
10 [0002]       All publications and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein
   incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent
   application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.
                                      FIELD OF THE INVENTION
15 [0003]       The present invention relates to an apparatus and a related method for the minimally
   invasive treatment of prostate tissue.
                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   [0004]       Several systems and methods have been developed or proposed for the treatment of
20 prostate tissue to alleviate BPH symptoms or to treat prostate tissue. For example, tissue
   ablation methods have been based on RF ablation, microwave ablation, high intensity focused
   ultrasound (HIFU), cryoablation, radiation, surgery, and brachytherapy. Surgical methods with
   and without robotic assistance have been developed for removal of diseased prostate tissue.
   [0005]       The apparatus, techniques and methods disclosed herein are adapted to for the
25 treatment of prostate tissue in general and more particularly are focused on treatment of BPH
   (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and prostate cancer. BPH is a common problem experienced by
   men over about 50 years old that relates to urinary tract obstruction. Prostatic hyperplasia or
   enlargement of the prostate gland leads to compression and obstruction of the urethra which
   results in symptoms such as the need for frequent urination, a decrease in urinary flow, nocturia
30 and discomfort.
   [0006]       Ablation of prostatic tissue with electromagnetic energy is well known and has the
   advantage of allowing a less invasive approach.      For example, high-frequency current in an
   electrosurgical ablation or prostatic tissue causes cell disruption and cell death. Tissue
   resorption by the body's wound healing response then can result in a volumetric reduction of
35 tissue that may be causing urinary tract obstruction. One disadvantage of high-frequency current
                                                     -1 -

   or laser ablation is potential tissue carbonization that results in an increased inflammatory
   response and far longer healing time following the ablation.
                                    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 5 [0007] In one aspect, the present invention provides a prostate therapy system comprising:
       an ablation probe adapted to be inserted transurethrally into a prostate lobe of an adult male
   human subject;
       a vapor generating inductive heater operatively connected to the ablation probe to deliver
   condensable vapor to ablate prostate tissue without ablating tissue of the prostatic urethra, the
10 vapor generating inductive heater comprising a plurality of hypotubes surrounded by a winding
   of wire for inductively heating the hypotubes using current provided by an electrical source; and
        an introducer adapted to be inserted into an adult human male urethra, the introducer
   comprising a distal port, the ablation probe being adapted to be advanced into a prostate lobe
   through the distal port and through an inner wall of the prostatic urethra.
15 [0008]     A method of treating a disorder of a prostate comprises introducing an ablation probe
   into a lobe of the prostate substantially parallel to a prostatic urethra, and ablating prostate tissue
   within the lobe without ablating tissue of the prostatic urethra.
   [0009]     Another method of treating a disorder of a prostate adjacent a prostatic urethra
   comprises delivering condensable vapor into the prostate, and ablating prostate tissue without
20 ablating the prostatic urethra.
   [0010]     Yet another method of treating a disorder of a prostate comprises introducing an
   ablation probe transurethrally through a urethral wall into an apex of a lobe of the prostate, and
   ablating prostate tissue in the prostate lobe.
   [0011]     In some embodiments, the introducing step can comprise advancing the ablation probe
25 through a urethral wall into an apex of the prostate lobe. In some embodiments, the introducing
   step comprises advancing the ablation probe at least 15 mm into the prostate lobe. The
   introducing step can further comprise advancing an introducer into a urethra and advancing the
   ablation probe through the introducer. In one embodiment, a port of the introducer can be placed
   against a urethral wall prior to advancing the ablation probe through the introducer. In another
30 embodiment, at least part of the introducer and at least part of the ablation probe have
   complementary shapes preventing rotation of the ablation probe with respect to the introducer.
   [0012]     In some embodiments, the ablating step can comprise delivering condensable vapor
   through the ablation probe into the prostate lobe. The condensable vapor can deliver between
   100 and 10,000 Joules to the prostate lobe, or between 20W and 1000W to the prostate lobe, or
35 between 100 cal/gm and 600 cal/gm to the prostate lobe.
                                                     -2-

   [0013]      In some embodiments, the delivering step can comprise delivering condensable vapor
   into the prostate lobe through a plurality of vapor ports in the ablation probe. The vapor ports
   can be oriented toward the urethra.
   [0014]      Another embodiment provides a prostate therapy system comprising an ablation probe
 5 adapted to be inserted transurethrally into a prostate lobe of an adult male human subject parallel
   to a prostatic urethra region of the subject, and an energy source operatively connected to the
   ablation probe to deliver energy to ablate prostate tissue without ablating tissue of the prostatic
   urethra. The energy source can comprise a condensable vapor source.
   [0015]      The ablation probe can be further adapted and configured to be advanced through a
10 urethral wall and into an apex of the prostate lobe. In one embodiment, the ablation probe is
   adapted to be inserted at least 15 mm into the prostate lobe. The system can further comprise an
   introducer adapted to be inserted into an adult human male urethra, the introducer comprising a
   distal port, the ablation probe being adapted to be advanced into a prostate lobe through the
   introducer port.
15 [0016]      In one embodiment, the ablation probe can comprise a plurality of vapor ports.
   [0017]      In another embodiment, at least part of the introducer probe and at least part of the
   ablation probe can have complementary shapes preventing rotation of the ablation probe with
   respect to the introducer.

                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
10 [0028]      A vapor energy generation system is provided that can be configured for introduction
   into a patient's urethra or prostate, or can be configured to access prostatic tissue trans-rectally or
   endoscopically. The system is configured to deliver a heated condensable vapor, for example
   water vapor, to tissue as described in the following co-pending U.S. Patent Applications: United
   States Patent Application No. 10/681,625, filed October 7, 2003, titled "Medical Instruments and
15 Techniques for Thermally-Mediated Therapies"; No. 11/158,930 filed June 22, 2005, titled
   "Medical Instruments and Techniques for Treating Pulmonary Disorders"; No. 11/244,329, filed
   October 5, 2005, titled "Medical Instrument and Method of Use"; and No. 11/329,381, filed
   January 10, 2006, titled "Medical Instrument and Method of Use".
   [0029]      The generation and delivery of a collapsible, high energy vapor for various
20 therapeutic procedures is further disclosed in systems with 'remote" vapor generation systems or
   sources in co-pending Provisional Patent Application Nos. 60/929,632, 61/066,396, 61/068,049,
   or with vapor generator in a handle or working end, or combination thereof, as described in
   Provisional Patent Application Nos. 61/068,130, 61/123,384, 61/123,412, 61/126,651,
   61/126,612, 61/126,636, 61/126,620.
25 [0030]      FIG. 1 illustrates a vapor energy generation system 800 having a handle 802
   comprising an inductive heating system similar to that described in applications 61/123,416,
   61/123,417, 61/126,647. In FIG. 1, the handle 802 is coupled by temperature resistant fitting
   806 to a fluid source 810 that delivers liquid at a controlled flow rate and pressure. The liquid
   flow passes through a vapor generating inductive heater 805 coupled to an electrical source and
30 controller 820. The system and handle is configured for a looped liquid/vapor flow to provide
   vapor to working end or exit channel 822 to deliver the vapor to a tissue site. The system has
   inflow channel indicated at 824 and outflow channel at 826 that can communicate with a
   collection reservoir 830 and/or a negative pressure source 835. A valve 836, for example,
   operated by a footswitch is provided in outflow channel 826 to re-direct vapor into the exit
35 channel 822 and extension member 840.
                                                     -4-

   [0031]       A vapor energy generation system 800 as shown in FIG. 1 can be used for any
   surgical/medical application, with the extension member 840 comprising a needle, an elongate
   ablation probe, a flexible catheter, or other similar elongate delivery devices. This system can be
   used for a catheter for delivering energy for endovascular applications, for treating respiratory
 5 tract disorders, for endometrial ablation treatments or for needle ablation treatments. In the
   embodiment of FIG. 1, an optional secondary heater 845 is shown with a concentric insulator
   846. This secondary heater can add further vaporization energy to vapor that starts to flow
   through exit channel 822. The secondary heater can be an inductive heater or a resistive heater
   that uses a microporous material to provide a large surface area to apply energy to the vapor to
10 remove any water droplets. This system can provide a vapor that is at least 90% water vapor.
   The secondary heater is operatively coupled to the electrical source and controller 820 by
   electrical leads (not shown).
   [0032]       FIG. 2 illustrates a vapor generating inductive heater 805 that in on embodiment
   comprises a ceramic cylinder 850 with a bore 852 therein. The ceramic cylinder 850 can be
15 approximately 1.0" to 1.5" in length and 0.25" in diameter with a 0.10" bore 852, for example.
   The bore 852 is packed with a plurality of small diameter hypotubes 855 that are magnetic
   responsive, such as 316 stainless steel, for example. In one embodiment, the hypotubes 855 are
   0.016 thin wall tubes. A winding 860 of one to ten layers having and an axial length of about
   1.0" is provided about the ceramic cylinder 850 for inductive heating of the hypotubes 855 using
20 very high frequency current from an electrical source. In one embodiment the winding 860 can
   be 26 Ga. Copper wire with a Teflon coating. It has been found that delivering at least 50W,
   100W, 200W, 300W, or 400W with suitable flow rates of water can produce very high quality
   vapor, for example 90% vapor and better.
   [0033]       In FIG. 2, it can be seen that an inductively heated hypotube 855' also can be spiral
25 cut to provide flexibility for such an inductive heater to be positioned in a catheter or probe
   working end. For example, such flexible heatable elements can be carried in the bore of a
   flexible high temperature resistant polymeric insulative member such to provide a flexible
   catheter that is configured for endovascular navigation. An insulation layer about an exterior of
   the inductive heater is not shown. In general, the vapor generating inductive heater 805 can
30 configured to provide a high quality vapor media with precise parameters in terms of vapor
   quality, exit vapor pressure from a working end, exit vapor temperature, and maintenance of the
   parameters within a tight range over a treatment interval. All these parameters can be controlled
   with a high level of precision to achieve controlled dosimetry, whether the particular treatment
   calls for very low pressures (e.g., 1-5 psi) or very high pressures (200 psi or greater) over a
                                                     -5-

   treatment interval, and whether the treatment interval is in the 1-10 second range or 2 to 5 minute
   range.
   [0034]      FIGS. 3-7 illustrate a prostate therapy system, including a vapor source 100
   operatively connected to an elongated instrument or introducer 102 with imaging system 104.
 5 The vapor source 100 can be a condensable vapor source, or other appropriate energy sources.
   The prostate therapy system can be introduced into a patient urethra 105 within prostate 106 and
   navigated to a predetermined location. The distal end of the instrument and imaging system 104
   can be used to identify anatomical landmarks during insertion. The imaging system can be an
   endoscope or CCD as known in the art. In one embodiment, the introducer 102 can include an
10 extending member 110 that extends through the urethra, and distal expandable structure such as
   balloon 112, which can assist in stabilizing the assembly within the prostate and axially register
   the assembly relative to anatomic landmarks and structures such as the bladder.
   [0035]      Referring to FIG. 3, a distal port 115 that can be straight or can have a memory
   curved configuration is extended from a channel 116 in introducer 102 to engage tissue about the
15 urethra while viewing through the imaging system 104. The prostate therapy system can include
   irrigation and aspiration means (not shown) to flow a fluid such as sterile water or saline into and
   through the urethra 105. The distal port is extended when the desired location in the urethra is
   indentified and engaged under slight or moderate pressure of the distal port 115 against the inner
   wall of the urethra. The distal port may be extended 'slightly' outward of channel 116 or can be
20 extended 5 mm or 10 mm or more from the channel.
   [0036]      As can be seen in FIG. 4, a vapor delivery needle or ablation probe 120 is extended
   through the distal port 115 into the prostate 106. The ablation probe can be operatively
   connected to the vapor source 100 to deliver energy to ablate prostate tissue. The ablation probe
   can be adapted to be inserted transurethrally into a prostate lobe of a male subject. In some
25 embodiments, the probe can be adapted to be inserted substantially parallel to the prostatic
   urethra region of the subject. The probe 120 can have a configuration with at least one curve that
   allows the working end 122 of the probe 120 having a curved or straight axis to extend
   substantially parallel to the prostatic urethra 105, rather than more transverse to the axis of the
   urethra. In some embodiments, the ablation probe is configured to be advanced through the
30 urethral wall into an apex of the prostate lobe.
   [0037]      The configuration of the probe working end 122 is adapted for vapor energy delivery
   and for controlling the geometry of the tissue ablated by the interstitial vapor propagation. In
   one embodiment, the vapor propagation and region of tissue ablation is elongated and
   substantially parallel to the urethra. In another embodiment, the vapor propagation and region of
35 tissue ablation extends substantially the length of the urethra through the prostate. In another
                                                     -6-

   embodiment, the vapor propagation and region of tissue ablation does not extend to peripheral
   regions of the prostate capsule except about the urethra. In another embodiment, the vapor
   propagation and region of tissue ablation does not allow heating of prostate tissue about the
   prostatic capsule which is adjacent nerves and nerve bundles. The treated tissue geometry is thus
 5 optimized for ablation and resorption of prostatic tissue adjacent the urethra without damage to
   prostate tissue not adjacent the urethra. The procedure described above is repeated to ablate
   tissue in the opposing prostate lobe. FIG. 5 depicts a method of angling an introducer 102' to
   better enable advancement of an ablation probe 120 into the prostate.
   [0038]       FIG. 6 is a sectional perspective view of the working end of one embodiment of a
10 needle or ablation probe 120. In FIG. 6, the probe 120 and working end 122 have a non-round
   cross section to prevent rotation relative to the introducer (not shown). The probe 120 can be
   fabricated of a biocompatible stainless steel or NiTi with a predetermined shape to accomplish to
   objectives described above. In one embodiment, the working end 122 of the probe carries a
   plurality of vapor outlets or ports 144 asymmetrically relative to the needle axis and more
15 particularly has vapor outlets oriented to direct vapor flow inwardly toward the urethra. The
   vapor ports 144 can number from about 2 to 50 and can have mean diameters ranging from about
   0.001" to 0.05". In a round probe 120 with a keyed shaft, the hollow needle diameter can range
   from about 40 ga. to 11 ga., with a similar flow cross section in non-round needles as in FIG. 6.
   As can be seen in FIG. 6, the probe can be rectangular in section with rounded corners, or
20 alternatively can be oval or round in shape. In a non-round probe, the major axis of the cross
   section can be greater that about 1.5x the minor axis of the cross section.
   [0039]       In FIG. 7, the vapor propagation is depicted with an ablated tissue volume about the
   urethra indicated at 140. For example, a needle or ablation probe 120 having vapor ports 144 as
   illustrated in FIG. 6 can allow vapor flowing through the probe to be directed towards the urethra
25 from within the prostatic tissue of a prostatic lobe. In order to achieve the directional
   propagation of vapor media as in FIG. 7, the probe 120 and its working end are further
   configured for rotational or angular registration with the distal port 115 and introducer 102 as
   described above. This aspect can be accomplished by at least a portion of the shaft of probe 120
   within the introducer 102 having a 'key' that is slidable within channel 116 to prevent relative
30 rotation between the probe shaft and the introducer. Thus, at least part of the introducer and at
   least of the ablation probe can have complementary shapes to prevent rotation of the ablation
   probe with respect to the introducer.
   [0040]       In general, a method for vapor delivery to ablate prostate tissue introducing a vapor
   delivery tool or needle into prostate tissue, and applying at least 20W, 50W, 100W, 200W,
35 400W, or 600W from the tool by means vapor energy release to ablate tissue. In one
                                                     -7-

   embodiment, the method applies energy that is provided by a condensable vapor that undergoes a
   phase change to provide applied energy of at least 100 cal/gm, 250 cal/gm, 300 cal/gm, 350
   cal/gm, 400 cal/gm and 450 cal/gm of the vapor.
   [0041]      In another embodiment shown in FIGS. 8A-8B, the working end 122 of needle or
 5 ablation probe 120 can carry a mono-polar electrode 150 or a bi-polar electrode arrangement 152
   to further apply energy to tissue. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 8C, an electrode 154 can be
   carried the elongate extending member 110 or a hypertonic saline electrode in the urethra can
   comprise a return electrode to cooperate with an electrode 150.
   [0042]      In general, a method for treating a disorder of the prostate comprises introducing an
10 ablation probe into a lobe of the prostate, and ablating prostatic tissue within the lobe. The
   ablation probe can ablate the prostatic tissue by delivering condensable vapor through the probe
   into the prostate lobe. The ablation probe can ablate prostate tissue within the lobe without
   ablating tissue of the prostatic urethra.
   [0043]      To gain access to the prostate, an introducer can be advanced transurethrally into the
15 urethra, and the ablation probe can be advanced through the introducer. In one embodiment, a
   port of the introducer can be placed against the urethral wall prior to advancing the ablation
   probe through the introducer. In one embodiment, at least part of the introducer and at least part
   of the ablation probe can have complementary shapes preventing rotation of the ablation probe
   with respect to the introducer. In some embodiments, the ablation probe can be introduced into a
20 lobe of the prostate substantially parallel to a prostatic urethra. In some embodiments, the
   ablation probe can be advanced through a urethral wall into an apex of the prostate lobe. The
   ablation probe can be advanced at least 15mm into the prostate lobe, for example. In some
   embodiments, the condensable vapor can be delivered into the prostate lobe through a plurality
   of vapor ports in the ablation probe. The vapor ports can be oriented towards the urethra, for
25 example.
   [0044]      These methods can utilize condensable vapor to deliver between 100 and 10,000
   Joules to the prostate lobe. In other embodiments, the condensable vapor can deliver between
   100W and 400W to the prostate lobe, or alternatively, between 20W and 1000W to the prostate
   lobe. In some embodiments, the condensable vapor can deliver between 250 cal/gm and 450
30 cal/gm to the prostate lobe, or alternatively, between 100 cal/gm and 600 cal/gm to the prostate
   lobe. The methods can cause localized ablation of prostate tissue, and more particularly the
   applied energy from vapor can be localized to ablate prostate tissue adjacent the urethra without
   damaging prostate tissue that is not adjacent the urethra.

   for a selected treatment interval. All these systems can be manually actuated, robotic or
   computer controlled.
   [0046]        In another embodiment, a method for treating a prostate disorder comprises
 5 introducing a thermal energy delivery member into prostate tissue proximate an anterior aspect
   of the urethra within the prostate and advancing the member distal end to a location proximate a
   posterior aspect of the urethra within the prostate, and applying energy from the needle to ablate
   prostate tissue adjacent the urethra. Again, the energy delivery member can include means to
   deliver a heated vapor.
10 [0047]        In another embodiment, a method for treating a prostate disorder comprises
   introducing a vapor delivery tool into prostate tissue proximate an anterior aspect of the urethra
   within the prostate and advancing the tool distal end at substantially parallel to the urethra within
   the prostate, and introducing vapor from the tool to ablate prostate tissue adjacent the urethra.
   [0048]        In another embodiment, a method for treating a prostate disorder comprises
15 introducing a vapor delivery needle into prostate tissue proximate an anterior aspect of the
   urethra within the prostate and advancing the needle substantially non-transverse relative to an
   axis of the urethra.
   [0049]        In another embodiment, a method for treating a prostate disorder comprises
   introducing a vapor delivery needle into prostate tissue proximate an anterior aspect of the
20 urethra within the prostate and advancing the needle at least 15 mm or at least 20 mm within
   prostate tissue.
   [0050]        In another embodiment, a method for treating a prostate disorder comprises
   introducing a vapor delivery needle into prostate tissue proximate an anterior aspect of the
   urethra within the prostate and advancing a non-linear shaped needle in a controlled path in the
25 tissue, wherein the needle is keyed relative to an introducer to prevent rotation of the needle.
   [0051]        In another embodiment, a method for treating a prostate disorder comprises
   introducing a dull-tipped distal port into a patient urethra, pressing the distal port tip into a
   targeted location in the wall of the urethra, and advancing a sharp-tipped needle from the distal
   port and through the wall or the urethra, and delivering energy from the needle to ablate prostate
30 tissue. The needle can be advanced from the distal port by means of a manual actuation or
   preferably can have a spring-loaded or other robotic actuation of the needle. In one embodiment,
   a spring-actuated movement of the needle tip is provided to advance the needle tip through the
   urethra in a first extension distance, and a second extension distance is accomplished by means
   of manual actuation.
                                                     -9-

   [0052]      In another embodiment, the introduction of the needle and the delivery of vapor can
   be accomplished under any suitable type of imaging. In one method, the steps can be viewed by
   means of ultrasound or x-ray imaging. In one method, the needle introduction and energy
   delivery methods can be imaged by ultrasound utilizing a trans-rectal ultrasound system.
 5 [0053]      In another embodiment, the system may be used to delivery of fluids for to specific
   locations in the prostate for medical purposes, such as for general or localized drug delivery,
   chemotherapy, or injections of other agents that may be activated by vapor or heat.
