ABSTRACT
A hay rake arrangement including an end frame, a longitudinal towable beam
mountable to the end frame, a pair of rake arms pivotally mounted at a first end to the
end frame, a pair of locking arm arrangements each connected to a corresponding
rake arm and including a locking means, so that when the rake arms are moved to
the open configuration the telescopic structure of each locking arms can be fastened
into place thereby allowing the pair of rake arms to remain in the characteristic V
shape as they are pulled by the tractor across the agricultural field to turn and/or rake
hay, grasses and/or the like.

  AN IMPROVED HAY RAKE ARRANGEMENT AND A METHOD OF IMPROVING
             USER HANDLEABILITY OF SAID HAY RAKE ARRANGEMENT
TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD
[001] This invention relates to an improved hay rake arrangement, the type of which
are generally towed along by drivable agricultural equipment such as a tractor.
[002] More particularly, this invention relates to the opening and closing motion of
the pair of moveable arms on which a plurality of rake wheels are uniformly
distributed there along as part of a Hay rake.
BACKGROUND ART DISCUSSION
[003] Conventionally, after hay, lucerne and other type grasses have been mowed,
the cut material must be turned over and raked into heaped piles or lines so as to
facilitate the gathering thereof into baling equipment in order to bale the material.
[004] One type of hay rake that assists in the raking and heaping of the cut material
to facilitate baling thereafter are generally referred to as collapsible V shaped hay
rakes wherein the equipment includes pivotally supported working rake arms on
which a plurality of rake wheels are uniformly distributed there along.
[005] Conventionally the pair of working rake arms are extended out into an open
shaped V configuration so as to effectively rake and heap the cut grass or hay as the
hay rake is towed across the agricultural field.
[006] Nonetheless when not in use, rather than having the pair of working arms then
extended in a V shaped configuration these rake arms are often brought close
together and/or folded into place generally parallel with the main longitudinal towable
beam which is mounted to the end frame to which the working rake arms are pivotally
supported thereon.
                                              1

[007] For general transportation and storage as well as manoeuvring about the
agricultural property, it becomes impractical for the rake arms to remain in their
extended V-shaped configuration, hence the need and requirement to fairly regularly
both open and close the pair of rake arms that characterise these kinds of hay rakes.
[008] While the opening and closing of these working arms which support thereon
the plurality of rake wheels uniformly distributed there along can be achieved through
automatic means including installation of expensive hydraulic cylinders which are
able to act upon the arms, often because of design constraints, maintenance
scheduling and cost, automatic means of opening and closing the pair of rake arms
are not always available and therefore many existing conventional hay rakes that
include the characteristic V shape when in operation also require the opening and
closing motion of the pair of working rake arms to be accomplished manually.
[009] While hitherto available manual mechanisms in the opening and closing of the
pair of rake arms of the hay rake may be fairly simple structurally, the problem is that
they are often inappropriate if current day handling procedures for operators are to
be followed.
[010] As is to be expected these kinds of working rake arms on traditional telescopic
arrangement to which the rake wheels are attached thereto are of significant weight
and therefore can be difficult to lift and fix into place using conventional manual
mechanisms, such as an operators natural lifting strength.
[011] Therefore, there still remains a need with respect to these kinds of hay rakes
which provide for a V shaped configuration when in use to be more safely, efficiently
and economically opened and closed if done so manually.
[012] Accordingly it is an object of this invention to provide for an improved hay rake
arrangement that will allow more efficient and safe user handleability of the pair of
rake arms when opening and closing the pair of working rake arms between their
operational and storage or transportation configuration.
                                               2

[013] Further objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from a
complete reading of the following specification.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[014] In one form of the invention there is provided a hay rake arrangement, towable
by a driveable agricultural machine such as a tractor, said hay rake arrangement
including;
[015] an end frame rideable on weight-bearing ground engaging wheels;
[016] a longitudinal towable beam mountable at one end to said end frame and
wherein the longitudinal towable beam at the other end is mountable to a driveable
agricultural machine such as a tractor;
[017] a pair of rake arms wherein said pair of rake arms each include a plurality of
rake wheels uniformly distributed there along the length of each of the pair of rake
arms and wherein each of the pair of rake arms are pivotally mounted at a first end to
the end frame on opposing sides of the longitudinal towable beam;
[018] said pair of rake arms having a folded or closed position, wherein each rake
arm of the pair of rake arms is substantially aligned in parallel with the longitudinal
towable beam, and wherein the pair of rake arms include an unfolded or open V
shaped configuration;
[019] a pair of locking arm arrangements, including a first locking arm arrangement
and a second locking arm arrangement, one for each of the respective rake arms of
the pair of rake arms;
[020] wherein the first locking arm arrangement and the second locking arm
arrangement are pivotally connected at one end to the longitudinal towable beam
and/or a structural frame mounted to said longitudinal towable beam and at another
end respectively pivotally connected to a corresponding rake arm of the pair of rake
arms;
                                            3

[021] each of the first locking arm arrangement and the second locking arm
arrangement including a telescopic structure arrangement so that as the pair of rake
arms move from the folded or closed position to an open and/or V shaped
configuration position, each locking arm arrangement allows the telescopic structure
to extend accordingly so as to remain structurally pivotally connected to the
respective rake arm of the pair of rake arms;
[022] the first locking arm arrangement and second locking arm arrangement
including a locking means, so that when the pair of rake arms are moved to the open
or V shaped unfolded configuration the telescopic structure of each of the first locking
arm arrangement and the second locking arm arrangement can be fastened and
locked into place thereby allowing the pair of rake arms to remain in the characteristic
V shape as they are pulled by the tractor across the agricultural field to turn and/or
rake hay, grasses and/or the like.
[023] In preference the telescopic structural arrangement of each of the first locking
arm arrangement and the second locking arm arrangement includes a top beam and
a bottom beam wherein the top beam and bottom beam are adapted to slidably
extend relatively along the respective lengths of the top beam and the bottom beam.
[024] In preference the top beam and the bottom beam are joined together by a
bracket arrangement, wherein the bracket arrangement includes at least a pair of
brackets each defining an opening of comparative dimensions of the top beam and
bottom beam to be generally secured therein to be restricted only to slidable lateral
movement between the adjacently positioned one upon the other top beam and
bottom beam.
[025] In preference the bracket arrangement further includes a roller or wheel
arrangement to assist in the sliding of the relevant movement between the top beam
and the bottom beam as the top beam and bottom beam are telescopically extended
and retracted relative to each other as the rake arms are moved from the folded or
closed position to the open or extended V shaped configuration and back again,
                                            4

[026] In preference each of the rake arms of the pair of rake arms, at an opposing
end to the end of the rake arms which is pivotally connected to the longitudinal
towable beam or a structural frame mounted to the longitudinal towable beam
includes a locking arrangement so as to structurally lock in place each of the
respective rake arms of the pair of rake arms to the longitudinal towable beam during
storage, transportation and/or manoeuvring during non-raking operation.
[027] Advantageously, as broadly described above, this invention has innovatively
provided for a very unique hay rake characterised with a distinctive pair of rake arms
that include the rake wheels attached there along that can be safely, conveniently
and efficiently manually opened and closed from the hay rakes operating
configuration to the storage configuration by the operator.
[028] No longer will there be the requirement to utilise potentially expensive
hydraulic cylinders to achieve the necessary safety and simplicity of the opening and
closing of the rake arms.
[029] In this invention the handler will no longer be required as they have in the past
to have to lift off each of the telescopic arms from the longitudinal towable beam,
thereby avoiding exposure to personal injury through excessive and unsafe lifting.
[030] While more specific details of the actual manual opening and closing of the
rake arms will be discussed in greater detail shortly hereafter in a preferred
embodiment when referencing the illustrations, for the most part all the handler of the
hay rake will be required to do will be to unlock, rather than lift each of the rake arms
from engagement with the longitudinal towable beam and then extend out each rake
arm to the required extended generally V shape configuration.
[031] Once that extended position has been achieved, as the telescopic structural
arrangement of each of the locking arms has followed the extension of the
corresponding rake arm, once the rake arms are then placed in position they can be
then fixed therein by fastening the telescopic arrangement of the first and second
locking arm arrangement into place.

will be described with the assistance of the following illustrations and accompanying
text.

unfolded and/or extended generally V shaped configuration.
[034] Figure 2 is a perspective view of the same hay rake arrangement shown in
Figure 1, in the closed or unfolded storage and/or transportation configuration.
[035] Figures 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d are schematic representations showing the method
involved for the operator to take the hay rake arrangement from the closed position to

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[036] Referring to the drawings now in greater detail, wherein shown generally is the
hay rake arrangement (10).
[037] The hay rake arrangement (10) includes an end frame shown generally as
(12) which is supported upon load bearing wheels (14).
[038] The longitudinal towable beam (16) is located at one end (18) to the end frame
(12).
[039] At the other end of the longitudinal towable beam (16) shown generally as (20)
is the structural section of the hay rake which would be mountable to a drivable
agricultural machine such as a tractor (not shown).
[040] The pair of rake arms (22) and (24) are pivotally mounted shown generally as
(26) and (28) to the end frame (12) to allow the rake arms (22) and (24) to move
between and open or generally V shaped configuration, again as seen in Figure 1
                                            6

when the hay rake is intended to functionally provide the ability to turn over and rake
the grass, hay or the like into the required heap for subsequent baling thereof.
[041] Importantly in the context of this invention, each of the pair of rake arms (22)
and (24) which can be extended out into the open position as shown in Figure 1 and
the closed position shown in Figure 2, are connected to a corresponding locking arm
arrangement shown as (42) engaging rake arm (22) and (44) for the other locking
arm arrangement engaging rake arm (24).
[042] Each of the locking arm arrangements (42) and (44) have been uniquely
telescopically structured so as to be able to extend and retract accordingly as the hay
rake is placed in its open configuration as shown in Figure 1 and the closed
configuration shown in Figure 2.
[043] Importantly, in order for the locking arm arrangements (42) and (44) to
appropriately telescopically extend as the pair of rake arms (22) and (24) are moved
manually between open and closed positions, there is the requirement that each of
these locking arm arrangements (42) and (44) are pivotally connected, firstly to the
longitudinal towable beam (16) which in this instance is through an additional bracket
or flange (51) at one end and then again towards the end (34) and (36) of each of the
respective rake arms (22) and (24) again by a pivotal joint shown as (47) and (49)
which is connected with a bracket extension (53) and (55) which is fixed in place and
mounted to the respective rake arm (22) and (24) accordingly.
[044] The telescopic structural arrangement of each of the locking arm
arrangements (42) and (44) of this invention includes a pair of slidably inter
engageable beams shown on the locking arm (44) as top beam (52a) and bottom
beam (52b) and on the locking arm (42) as top beam (50a) and bottom beam (50b).
[045] The ability of the respective top beams and bottom beams to slidably
telescopically extend relative to each other is achieved by way of the bracket and
guide arrangement shown as (54a) and (54b) on the locking arm (42) and (56a) and
(56b) on the locking arm (44).
                                             7

[046] These brackets are able to keep the top and bottom beams together in a
generally fixed and confined relationship permitting only relative lateral slidable
extension movement along the lengths of each of the relevant top and bottom
beams.
[047] This inter-relationship of the slidable interaction between the top and bottom
beams of the respective locking arm arrangements (42) and (44) is enhanced by the
inclusion of a roller shown as (63) and (65) best seen in Figure 2.
[048] Once the locking arms (42) and (44) have been extended out by the fact that
the corresponding rake arms (22) and (24) have been pushed out into their required
configuration as best seen in Figure 1, then the extended configuration of the
respective top and bottom beams making up each of the locking arms (42) and (44)
can be then locked in place by the resiliently biased pin (58) on locking arm (42) and
resilient locking pin (60) on locking arm (44).
[049] Although not clear from the drawings, the bottom and top slidable beams or
rods, would have a series of apertures there along so as to allow the resilient locking
pins (58) and (60) to be slotted therein at the required extended length to then fixedly
hold the rake arms (22) and (24) in place, whether that be in the open configuration
shown in Figure 1 or in the closed position as shown in Figure 2.
[050] Uniquely the hay rake arrangement (10) also includes the ability to further lock
the rake arms (22) and (24) in place when the hay rake arrangement (10) is in the
closed position as shown in Figure 2 through the structural locking mechanism shown
generally as (38) and (40) as it engages with the respective structural ends (34) and
(36) of the corresponding pair of rake arms (22) and (24).
[051] Figure 1 shows the locking arrangement (38) and (40) disengaged from the
ends of the rake arms (22) and (24) which then permits the pair of rake arms (22) and
(24) which will be discussed in greater detail when referencing Figures 3a through to
3d to be extended thereout.
                                             8

[052] Figures 3a through to 3d provide schematically an understanding as to how an
operator (70) will be able to conveniently, safely and without difficulty, manually open
and close the pair of rake arms without having to unnecessarily lift any heavy
structures.
[053] Figure 3a shows the operator (70) manoeuvring the hay rake (10) from a
closed configuration shown in Figure 3a to ultimately the opened configuration in
Figure 3c.
[054] In Figure 3a the operator (70) in order to safely and manually open the hay
rake (10) between the closed and open position, first must just disengage the locking
mechanism (38) and (40) from the respective ends (34) and (36) of each of the rake
arms (22) and (24).
[055] Throughout the illustrations each of the rake arms (22) and (24) do not show
the plurality of rake wheels which would be uniformly distributed along the length of
the respective rake arms (22) and (24).
[056] Their exclusion from the illustrations is done so as to provide a clearer
illustration of the essential elements of this invention.
[057] As again seen in Figure 3a the handler will no longer be required as they have
in the past to have to lift off each of the telescopic arms from the longitudinal towable
beam, thereby avoiding exposure to personal injury through excessive and unsafe
lifting.
[058] The corresponding wheels (30) and (32) as seen in Figure 3b allows the
operator to rotate independently each of the rake arms (22) and (24) into place.
[059] As each of the rake arms (22) and (24) are independently rotated and/or
extended into position by the operator (70) due to the pivotable structural support of
each of the rake arms (22) and (24) at locations (26) and (28) upon the end frame
(12) and also by the assistance of the ground engaging wheels (30) and (32) without
any risk to the operator through difficult lifting and manoeuvring, the operator can
                                               9

open up the rake arms (22) and (24) into the required configuration as shown as a
general V shape in Figure 3d.
[060] As the locking arms (42) and (44) are structurally connected to each of rake
arms (22) and (24) as rake arms (22) and (24) are extended out between that closed
position in Figure 3a and the ultimate open position in Figure 3d, the telescopic
structure of each of the locking arms (42) and (44) including the respective top beam
and bottom beam allow the locking arms (42) and (44) to extend thereout and as best
seen in Figure 3c once the length of the opening of the two rake arms (22) and (24)
has been achieved, the operator (70) can then engage the resilient pins (58) and (60)
to then lock the top and bottom beams of each of the respective locking arms (42)
and (44) in their extended configuration.
[061] As the locking arms (42) and (44) can be locked into place within their
extended configuration, this then keeps the pair of rake arms (22) and (24) in their
open position during their ground-engaging activity in turning and raking grass or hay
after it has been mowed in order for it to be gathered into appropriate heaps for
subsequent baling.
