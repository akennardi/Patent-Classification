                                          SHOCK TUBE ACCESSORY
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0001]                 This invention relates generally to a shock tube of the kind used to initiate
an explosion in a rock blasting process and, more particularly, is concerned with an
accessory for use with a shock tube.
[0002]                 During a mining operation for the extraction of coal from an underground
location boreholes are drilled into which an explosive material is placed. Upon
initiation of the explosive material the rock is displaced and the coal can be
accessed.
[0003]                 The drilling of a borehole, for blasting purposes, can cause the release of
methane gas from a coal deposit, into the borehole. In a shock tube initiating system
a detonator, attached to a shock tube, is positioned in the borehole and an emulsion
is then charged into the hole. Methane gas which is released from a coal seam, in
the manner referred to, can often be seen bubbling through the charged emulsion.
The methane gas, depending on environmental conditions such as temperature and
pressure can, after a reasonable time period, permeate and diffuse through a
polymeric wall of the shock tube and, for reasons which are not fully understood, this
phenomenon can interfere with the propagation of a wave front along the shock tube
when initiation is to take place. When this occurs a misfire results.
[0004]                 The construction of the shock tube can be improved, to some extent, by
increasing the thickness of a sleeve of the shock tube or by altering the nature of the
material used in the construction of the shock tube. These measures increase the
time period needed for the methane gas to diffuse through the wall of the shock tube
but the cost of the shock tube is however increased.
[0005]                An object of the present invention is to address the aforementioned
situation in a different way.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006]                 The invention provides an accessory, for use with a shock tube, which
includes a body which, in use, is connected to the shock tube and wherein the body
9789214_1 (GHMatters) P107801.AU

                                                       -2
includes a gas pressure release mechanism in gas communication with an interior of
the shock tube.
[0007]                 The gas pressure release mechanism may be configured to prevent the
ingress of moisture from a surrounding environment into an interior of the shock tube.
[0008]                 The gas pressure release mechanism may take on different forms. In one
example of the invention the gas pressure release mechanism includes an enclosure
made of a suitable material, such as an elastomer, which is inflatable as the pressure
inside an interior of the shock tube to which the accessory is connected, increases.
The inflation of the enclosure is achieved by allowing gas, under pressure, to exit
from an interior of the shock tube and, in this way, the pressure prevailing inside the
shock tube is reduced. The enclosure could take on any suitable form and for
example could be in the nature of a small balloon. Care should be taken to ensure
that the enclosure can withstand the operating conditions in which it is to be used.
Such conditions could lead to premature failure of, or damage to, the enclosure e.g.
the enclosure could be ruptured under adverse conditions.
[0009]                 In a different form of the invention the gas pressure release mechanism
comprises a pressure relief valve which opens to allow gas under pressure to escape
from an interior of the shock tube to a surrounding environment, when the pressure
of the gas, inside the shock tube, reaches a pre-determined level. The valve may be
of any suitable form and, for example, may comprise a so-called "duckbill" valve i.e. a
valve which has one or more flaps which are configured to ... an aperture and
release in response to gas pressure above a predetermined level move, thereby to
open the aperture to allow gas passage through the aperture.
[0010]                 It is possible for the accessory to be secured to the shock tube at any
suitable location which is not, in use, exposed directly to an emulsion explosive i.e.
under normal conditions the accessory should not, itself, be immersed in the
emulsion explosive, during use.
[0011]                 Without being restrictive the accessory is preferably engaged with an out
hole end of the shock tube.

similar process.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0013]                 The invention is further described by way of examples with reference to
the accompanying drawings in which:
Figure 1 schematically illustrates a shock tube installation in which a gas diffusion
problem of the kind referred to can occur, and
Figures 2, 3 and 4 illustrate in cross-section, respectively, different accessories
according to the invention which are usable for addressing the gas diffusion problem.
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0014]                 Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings schematically illustrates from one
side and in cross-section a borehole 10 formed in a body of rock 12 from a rock face
14. The borehole 10 is drilled, using a suitable technique, through the rock 12, which
normally is barren of coal, to a coal seam 16. Thereafter a detonator 20 which is at
one end 22 of a shock tube 24 is placed into the hole 10. An explosive emulsion 26 is
then charged into the hole to a suitable depth. Optionally stemming, not shown, is
placed over an exposed surface 28 of the emulsion 26.
[0015]                An out-hole end 30 of the shock tube 24 is accessible on the face 14 and
can be connected, as required, to a system (not shown) used for initiating the
explosive 26 via the shock tube 24 and detonator 20.
[0016]                As has been described in the preamble to the specification bubbles 36 of
methane gas, released from the coal seam 16, can enter the emulsion 26 and,
depending on various environmental conditions prevailing at the borehole 10, can
subsequently permeate or diffuse through a sheath or wall of the shock tube. This
occurrence under certain conditions, can lead to failure of the shock tube i.e. the
shock tube is not capable of propagating an initiating signal from the out-hole end 30
to the detonator 20.

[0017]                 Figures 2 to 4 illustrate respective accessories 40, 42 and 44 which can be
used to reduce the pressure of gas inside the shock tube.
[0018]                 Figure 2 illustrates a gas pressure release device 40 which includes an
inflatable enclosure or sheath 46 made from a thin-walled elastomeric material. The
sheath 46 is coupled to a metal ring 50 which is placed over the out-hole end 30 of
the shock tube 24 and which is crimped to an outer surface 52 of the shock tube 24
in a leak proof manner. The end 30 of the shock tube is in direct communication with
an interior 56 of the sheath 46.
[0019]                 If methane gas permeates through a wall of the shock tube, into the
interior of the shock tube, then the pressure inside the shock tube increases. The
pressure in the interior 56 of the sheath 46 also increases and, consequently, if the
sheath is correctly designed, the sheath is inflated and this leads to the pressure
inside the shock tube 24 being reduced.
[0020]                 The use of the leak proof seal, formed by crimping the accessory in
position on the out-hole end of the shock tube, is necessary in that the accessory
should also function to prevent the ingress of moisture from a surrounding
environment through the out-hole end 30 into an interior of the shock tube 24.
[0021]                 Figure 3 illustrates an accessory 42 which includes a crimping ring 50
which, as before, is crimped in position in a leak proof manner to an outer surface 52
of a shock tube 24 at an out-hole end 30. The accessory 42 includes a one-way
valve structure 60 formed from two flexible flaps 62 and 64, which are made from a
suitable polymer, and which are biased by the natural resilience of the polymer,
towards each other, as is shown in Figure 3 to form what is known as a "duck bill"
valve. An interface 66 between the flaps 62 and 64 is thus automatically sealed and,
in this way, the ingress of moisture from the environment into an interior of the shock
tube via the out-hole end 30 is avoided.
[0022]                 If gas pressure builds up inside the shock tube 24 then this pressure is
transmitted to an interior 68 of the one-way valve 60. Once the gas pressure is
sufficiently high the flaps 62 and 64 are pushed apart slightly and gas escapes from

                                                       -5
the interior 68 to the environment thereby leading to an automatic reduction of the
pressure prevailing inside the shock tube 24.
[0023]                 Figure 4 illustrates a preferred embodiment 44 of the accessory of the
invention. A sleeve 70, made from a suitable flexible material such as rubber, is fixed
via a metallic or plastic crimping ring 50 to an outer surface 52 of a shock tube 24 in
a leak proof manner. The sleeve 70 encloses a volume 72 which is in direct
communication with the out-hole end 30 of the shock tube 24. A wall of the sleeve, at
an appropriate location, is formed with a reduced dimension. In this instance a disc
like end 76 of the accessory, which bounds an end of the sleeve 70 and which
opposes the out-hole end 30, has a flexible membrane 78 formed by reducing the
thickness of the end 76.
[0024]                 The flexible membrane 78 is shown on an enlarged scale in the insert
drawing to Figure 4. A small pin or needle, not shown, is used to make a puncture 82
through the membrane 78. In this process material is not removed but is displaced
for the puncturing only ruptures the material and, when the pin or needle is removed,
the puncture closes, due to the natural resilience of the material from which the
membrane is made.
[0025]                 Water which may be present on an outer side 86 of the membrane 78 is
not able to penetrate the puncture 82. However, if gas enters the shock tube 24, in
the manner which has been described, the gas ultimately reaches the volume 72 and
the pressure inside this volume increases as the pressure prevailing inside the shock
tube increases. The gas pressure causes the membrane 78 to bulge outwardly. As
this occurs the membrane 78 is stretched and the puncture 82 is revealed
transforming into a small hole. Gas inside the volume 72 can then escape to the
surrounding environment through the hole. The gas pressure inside the volume 72
and hence inside the shock tube 24 is automatically reduced. The stress in the
membrane 78 is also reduced whereupon the membrane reverts to a configuration in
which the hole is transformed back to the puncture 82 which is effectively self
sealing.

[0026]                 The pressure reduction accessories shown in Figures 2 to 4 are low cost,
disposable mechanisms which are effective in mitigating against the adverse effects
of methane gas permeating under pressure into an interior of the shock tube.
