                                MODULAR BUILDING SYSTEM
            The present invention relates to an industrialized building system with a wooden
   framework for the construction of buildings.
 5          The present invention is more particularly related to a building system the
   performances of which permit stacks on many floor levels without applied supporting
    structures.
            Wooden building systems are already known, they are basically three in number,
   and each has advantages and drawbacks.
10          Known is thus the assembly of walls made of glued solid wood, where continuous
   wood panels are reconstructed from assemblies of small-section wood in crossed layers.
   The so obtained panels are used for filling a bearing structure or as a bearing structure
   according to specific assembling standards.
            Also known are upright-and-beam structures, including a large-section wooden
15 structure that is assembled in floors, its dimensioning for vertical (uprights) and
   horizontal elements (beams) as well as their assembling connections take over all the
   necessary efforts to construct the building, the applied slabs as well as the wall panels
   the complete building envelope, and may eventually provide bracing functions for the
   bearing upright-and-beam structure.
20          Finally, also known are buildings of the wooden framework type, namely a wall
   panel is formed of vertical wooden uprights secured to a bottom rail and a top rail for
   forming a panel. The panel is formed of this braced structure by one - or two - bracing
   panel fastened to the structure. The so obtained panels are used for filling a bearing
   structure or as bearing structure according to specific assembling standards.
25          These wooden frame walls can be placed on the intermediate floors or on upright
   and-beam structures.
            The bottom and top rails have several mechanical and structural functions,
   namely:
            - securing and holding the uprights with the desired distance between each other.
30          - fastening the bottom rail for keeping the panel in alignment and at the reaction
   loads.
           - fastening the upper building elements to the top rail of the panel.

                                                   2
            The bottom and top rails permit to stitch the material or bracing system at the
   bottom and top edges of the panel.
            The conventional wood-framework building has however limitations. Thus, the
   bottom and top rails of a wooden-framework panel take up the load carried by each
 5 upright in the direction perpendicular to the fiber of the wood.
            The wood carries much more load per unitary area in the direction of the fiber
   than in the direction perpendicular to the fiber, the result is a crushing of the rails or the
   elements of solid wood at the horizontal fibers at the punctual reaction loads.
           Typically, a conventional framework system with load transfer onto wood with
10 horizontal fibers permits to carry buildings with wooden framework up to level R+2, i.e.
   three levels, beyond this there is a risk of punctual crushing of this solid wood that arrives
   at the structural limit.
           The aim of the present invention is to provide a prefabricated building system
   with a wooden framework structure, which is transportable and which is largely stackable
15 without applied bearing structure and without being limited in number of levels that can
   be built.
           The modular building system according to the invention is characterized in that
   it consists of a building system in which the carcassing is made up of several
   prefabricated units assembled as a stack ; and in that each of said units consists of a
20 wooden framework structure comprising a succession of vertical uprights spaced apart
   with a standardized spacing, the vertical uprights of which span the entire height between
   floors, and in that said vertical uprights of the wall at floor N+1 each rest directly on a
   vertical upright of level N, while assemblies lateral to the vertical uprights and/or
   assemblies on elements inserted between vertical uprights perform the functions of
25 holding and bracing said uprights.
           The reaction load permitted per upright is much higher in this configuration, there
   is no wood with horizontal fibers taking up load and therefore no crushing.
           No posts for taking up are necessary as in an upright-and-beam system, we remain
   in the standard wooden framework, upright cross-sections and spacing, structural class
30 of wood according to the current legislation.
           According to another version of the modular building system according to the
   invention, it is characterized in that it consists of a building system in which the

                                                 3
   carcassing is made up of several prefabricated units assembled as a stack ; and in that
   each of said units consists of a wooden framework structure comprising a succession of
   vertical uprights spaced apart with a standardized spacing, the vertical uprights of which
   span the entire height between floors, and in that said vertical uprights of the wall at floor
 5 N+1 each rest on a vertical upright of level N after having interposed between them an
   element capable of ensuring the transfer or the reaction loads and made of a material or
   a composite of several materials, which is selected so as to maintain its mechanical
   properties under load stresses of the upper floor or floors, while assemblies lateral to the
   vertical uprights and/or assemblies on elements inserted between vertical uprights ensure
10 the functions of holding and bracing said vertical uprights.
            The interposed elements, made of a material or a composite of several materials,
   for example metal, are also likely to form fastening means.
            Their nature and dimensional characteristics are of course chosen and calculated
   depending on the characteristics of the building, and namely the load they may be
15 subjected to. This excludes the solid wood, which, as was mentioned above, can arrive
   at the structural limit of compression, and thus lead to risks of punctual crushing.
            These elements may consist of sheets, or profiles, non-restrictively of metal, for
   example angle irons. They can also be made of materials such as concrete, whether
   reinforced or not, a resin, whether or not reinforced with fibers, reconstituted wood
20 panels, joined or glued industrial wood, laminated industrial wood, wood species selected
   for having the required compression properties, polymeric or biobased materials based
   on polymeric or natural binders, ferrous or non-ferrous metals, assemblies of several of
   these materials, by way of an example one that can provide compression or shear
   strength, the other providing torque strength, or one of the composite materials can be
25 selected for providing fire resistance, for example.
            It is possible that a vertical upright is not in the exact extension of the
   corresponding vertical upright of the upper and/or lower level. The aim of these elements
   is to permit the compensation of a shift in the longitudinal direction of the wall.
           According to an additional feature of the building system according to the
30 invention, the vertical uprights are assembled on a lower horizontal beam, which is
   intended to carry the floor joists.

                                                  4
           According to another additional feature of the building system according to the
    invention, the vertical uprights are assembled on an upper horizontal beam, which is
    intended to carry ceiling or roof joists.
           According to another additional feature of the building system according to the
 5  invention, the vertical uprights carry directly ceiling or roof joists.
           The prefabricated units are intended to be stacked onto each other, and sets of
    stacked units may be juxtaposed, which can be carried out in many and varied ways, such
   as for example, non-restrictively, between longitudinal beams, between longitudinal
   beams and joists, between longitudinal beams and uprights, between uprights and
10 uprights, between uprights and joists, etc... .
           The advantages and features of the building system according to the invention
   will become clear from the following description, which refers to the attached drawing,
   which represents several non-restrictive embodiments of same.
           In the attached drawing:
15         - Figure 1 shows a schematic perspective view of a structure made according to
   the building system according to the invention.
           - Figure 2 shows a schematic perspective view of a variant of the same structure.
           - Figure 3 shows a schematic perspective view of another embodiment of a
   structure according to the building system according to the invention.
20         - Figure 4 shows a partial schematic perspective view of yet another embodiment
   of a structure according to the building system according to the invention.
           When referring to Figure 1, we can see a structure made according to the building
   system according to the invention.
           This structure comprises two stacked modules 1, which are of an identical design.
25         Each module 1 comprises vertical uprights 2, which are parallel and spaced apart
   with a determined spacing for forming a bearing wall, which spacing may be ensured,
   not-restrictively, by spacers, not shown.
           In the embodiment shown, the uprights 2 of the same wall of a module 1 are
   assembled in the lower portion by means of a horizontal beam 3, and the two horizontal
30 longitudinal beams 3 of two opposite walls carry floor joists 4, while the uprights of the
   two walls 2 carry in the upper portion ceiling or roof joists 5.
           Furthermore, each wall is reinforced by an inner 20 and/or an outer bracing 21.

                                                 5
            These assemblies can be of any kind, they will be calculated so as to be sufficient
   to guarantee the cohesion of the structure of the modular unit for transport and then
   during its use as a structural element of the building.
            According to the invention, the upper module 1 rests on the lower module 1
 5 through direct abutment of each of the vertical uprights 2 of the module 1 against an
   upper vertical upright 2 of the module 1 below. The vertical uprights 2 are thus, from one
   level to another, in the extension of each other, without interposition of wood with
   horizontal fibers taking over the load and therefore there is no risk of crushing.
            When referring now to figure 2, we can see a variant in which the vertical uprights
10 2 of the same wall are assembled in the upper portion on a horizontal beam 50, which
   carries the ceiling or roof joists 5.
            When referring now to figure 3, we can see another embodiment of a structure
   according to the invention. Thus, each of the vertical uprights 1 of an upper module 1 is
   not directly in abutment against a vertical upright 1 of the lower module 1, but there is
15 interposed an element 6 made of a material, or a composite of several materials, which
   is selected so as to be capable to retaining its mechanical properties under the stress of
   the load of the upper floor or floors, and which may consist, non-restrictively, of a sheet.
           Depending on the mechanical properties of the elements 6, it can be contemplated
   to shift the vertical uprights 2 of a lower module 1 relative to those of an upper module
20 1, the elements 6 ensuring the load transfer and being selected so as to withstand the
   compression and shear stresses generated by the building.
           In this embodiment, it should be noted that the two stacked modules 1 share two
   horizontal beams 30 and the same joists 40, which, for the lower module 1, form upper
   longitudinal beams and ceiling joists, respectively, while they form, for the upper
25 module, lower longitudinal beams and floor joists, respectively.
           Figure 4, which relates to the same embodiment, permits to observe that, on the
   one hand, the elements 6 interposed between the vertical uprights 2 of a lower module 1
   and those of an upper module 1 consists, non-restrictively, of angle-shaped profile bars
   and, on the other hand, the assemblies of the various components of the structure are
30 made through connectors C.
           Irrespective of the embodiment considered, the building system according to the
   invention permits to make structures without limitation of the number of levels.
