                                            ABSTRACT
Exemplary methods and devices can be provided for harvesting a plurality of small tissue pieces, e.g.,
having widths less than about 1 mm or 0.5 mm, using one or more hollow needles. A fluid can be
flowed through a conduit past the proximal ends of the needles to facilitate removal of the tissue
pieces from the needle lumens, and can maintain the tissue pieces in a controlled and protective
liquid environment. A filter can be used to extract and collect the tissue pieces from the liquid, or
the tissue pieces can be deposited directly onto a porous dressing. Such tissue pieces can be used as
microscopic grafts, which can be applied directly to a wound site or provided on a substrate or
dressing, or stored for later use. Such microscopic grafts can promote tissue regrowth and wound
healing, or can be applied to a scaffold to grow new tissue.

                                            TECHNICAL FIELD
        [00021          The present disclosure relates to method and apparatus for fluid-assisted
       harvesting of small tissue specimens ftom a donor site.
                                      BACKGROUND INFORMATION
10      100031          Various approaches to tissue copying and grafting are being developed, in
       which small columns of tissue (microscopic tissue columns, or MITCs) are removed from a
       donor site and can be used in various procedures such as, e.g, being introduced into a
       recipient site, implanted in a matrix, etc, Such approaches are described, e.g, in International
       Patent Publication No. WO 2009/1.46068.
15      100041          The MTCs are typically less than. about i mm in diameter and their removal is
       well-tolerated by the donor site. For example, the holes formed in a donor site by removal of
       MTCs can heal rapidly with little or no visible scar or marking formed because of the small
       size of the holes and their being surrounded by healthy tissue These columns of living tissue
       can nucleate and/or stimulate growth of new tissue. The small size of the MTCs f vors their
20     survival in various environments.
         0005j          The MTCs can be harvested using a hollow needle. However, they tend to be
       fragile tissue samples that can be adversely affected by their surroundings ant handlingec.,
       they may be contaminated or mechanically stressed after being cut or otherwise separated and
       then removed from the donor site.. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a method and
25     apparatus for harvesting MTCs that facilitates their rapid extraction from a donor site and
       subsequent retrieval and storage without damaging them.
       100061           Accordingly, there may be a need to address and/or overcome at least some of
       the issues indicated herein above.

                         SUMMARY OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS
   [00071           According to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, method and
   apparatus can be provided for harvesting small samples of biological tissue (e.g, microscopic
   tissue columns, or MTCs) that are typically less than about 1 mm in width, and niay be longer
 5 in length. The removal of such small MTCs can be well-tolerated by the donor site. For
   example, the small regions of damage in the donor site caused by removal of the tissue
   samples (eg, MTCs) heal rapidly with little or no formation of visible scars,
   100081           In certain exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the method and
   apparatus can facilitate harvesting MTCs that uses one or more hollow needles to extract the
10 MTCs from a tissue donor site. For example, an apparatus can be provided that includes one
   or more hollow harvesting or 'coring' needles, preferably extending from a housing. The
   distal end of the needle is configured to penetrate the tissue, so that a portion of tissue (an
   MTC) will be cut away from the surrounding tissue by the needle tip and walls, and. located
   in a distal portion of the hollow lumen of the needle. The MTC can be removed from the
15 surrounding tissue and remain in the lumen of the needle when the needle is withdrawn, An
   inner diameter of the hollow needle can be less than about 1 mm in diameter, e.g., between
   about 0.15 mm and 0.5 mm, for cosmetic treatments involvig skin,            hIfurther exemplary
   embodiments, larger diameters may be used to harvest samples from other tissues or organs
   that may be more tolerant of damage and/or for which visible scarring is not problematic.
20 100091           A conduit can be provided in the apparatus that is configured to circulate a
   fluid past a proximal end of each coring needle, The lumen of the hollow needle can be in
   fluid communication with the conduit. The flowing fluid helps to draw the MTC up through
   the lumen of the needle and into the fluid path after the MITC 5s separated froni surrounding
   issue, where the MTC can then be surrounded by a protective fluid environment.
25 10010]           A filter arrangement that can include, egg filter element, a mesh basket or
   the like, can be provided in the flow path of the circulating fluid such that the harvested
   MTCs within the flowing fluid can then be trapped in the filter arrangement while the fluid
   passes through. In certain exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the filter
   arrangement can be provided in a chamber, and a cap or cover can be provided to facilitate
30 access to the harvested MTCs. A vent can optionally be provided to release air that may be
   entrained in the fluid during harvesting of the MTCs.

   WO 2014/028626                                                                PCT/US2013/054955
   100111          According to further exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the
   fluid containing entrained MTCs can be directed by a delivery arrangement onto a porous
   dressing or substrate external to the site, For example, MTCs can be deposited directly from
   the flowing liquid onto a porous dressing, and the dressing with MTCs can then be applied
 5 directly to a wound site. The delivery arrangement and substrate can be moved relative to
   one another such that MTCs are deposited over a particular region of the dressing/substrate
   during the harvesting procedure, In still further exemplary embodiments of the present
   disclosure, the porous dressing can be provided as part of the filter arrangement.
   100121          The fluid characteristics can be selected to provide a gentle environment for
10 the MTCs, to prevent contamination. and/or to promote their viability and growth, The faid
   can be temperature-controlled using conventional thermal control systems. The fluid can
   contain a variety of substances, including saline, growth factors, buffers, etc. Various sensors
   and controllers can optionally be provided, e g., to monitor and/or control such parameters as
   fluid temperature and flow rate, fluid composition, pressure at various locations within the
15 apparatus, etc.
   1001.3]         An actuator such as a solenoid, a motor with a rotary/linear converter, or the
   like can be provided to direct the needles into the donor tissue and then withdraw them. Such
   actuators can be controlled using a conventional power source and controller arrangement.
   100141          According to additional exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, a
20 lower portion of the exemplary apparatus can be shaped to create a recess between the tissue
   surface and a lower surface of the apparatus, One or more ducts can be provided in
   commumni cation with this enclosed space, and a source of low pressure can be connected to
   the ducts to pull the tissue surface upward, thereby stretching and stabilizing the tissue to
   facilitate penetration by the needles. An elevated pressure can optiomally be connected to the
25 ducts after penetration by the needles to push the tissue back down. In certain embodiments.
   the needles can be held stationary with respect to the lower surface of the apparatus, and an
   alternating low and high pressure can be applied to pull the tissue onto the needles and then
   pull it away from them.

             DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
   100241           The present disclosure relates to a method and apparatus for harvesting
   microscopic tissue columns (MTCs) that uses one or more hollow needles to extract the
   MTCs from a tissue donor site, An apparatus can be provided that includes one or more
 5 hollow harvesting or coringt needles.
   10025]           An illustration of a side perspective view of an exemplary hollow harvesting
   needle 100 is provided in FIG, IA, The inner diameter of the needle 100 can be selected to
   approximiatelycorrespond to a particular diameter of a tissue sample or MTC to be removed
   from the donor site as described herein. For example, 18, 19 or 20 gauge biopsy needles
10 (e.g, having an inner diameter of 0.838 mm., 0.686 mm and 0.564 mm, respectively) or the
   like can be used to form the tube. In general, needles having a gauge size between 18 and 30
   or the equivalent can be used for cosmetic applications such as skin resurfacing. In general,
   the inner diameter of such needle 100 (e.g, the diameter of the central lumen) can be, e.g,
   between about 1 mm and about 0.15 mm, or preferably between about 0.5 mm and 0.15 mm.
15 Such smaller inner diameters can be used to separate and remove MTCs having a similar
   width from surrounding tissue. MTCs having such small widths may exhibit desirable
   viability. for example, because nutrients can more readily be transported directly to more
   cells in the MTC from surrounding environment. A hollow needle or tube 100 having a
   slighly larger or smaller inner diameter can also be used in further embodiments, e. based
20 on the type of tissue being harvested, if larger or smaller MTCs are desired. For example,
   larger diameters may be used to harvest samples from tissues or organs other than skin that
   may be more tolerant of damage and/or fbr which visible scarring is not probleiatc.
   100261           The harvesung needle 100 shown in FIG 1A includes a distal end that can be
   formed as a plurality of piercing arrangements (e.g., including points) 105. A side view of a
25 distal end of the needle 100 is shown in FIG- I B. For example; the two exemplary points 105
   shown in FIG. 1A can be formed by grinding flat bevels on opposite sides of the needle 100
   at an angle a relative to the long axis of the needle, as shown in FIG 1B, The angle a can be,
   e.g, between about 100 and about 25', or between about 100 and. 200. Such narrow tip angles
   can facilitate penetration of the needle 100 into tissue and a severing of tisse within the
30 lumen of the needle 100 from adjacent tissue as the needle 10) is advanced. In further
   exemplary embodiments, the distal end of the harvesting needle 100 can be provided with
   three or more points 105, e.g. by forming three or more angled flat bevels at different
   orientations, and optionally at different angles.

   WO 2014/028626                                                                  PCT/US2013/054955
   100271           The exemplary points 105 and associated beveled edges can facilitate inserting
   of the distal end of the needle 100 into donor-site ussue and removal of MTCs therefrom.
   For example, the distal end of the harvesting needle 100 can be configured to penetrate the
   tissue, so that a portion of tissue (an MTC) will be cut away from the surrounding tissue by
 5 the needle ips 105 and adjacent beveled edges, such that the MTC will be located in the
   hollow lumen of the needle 100- The needle 100 can be formed of metal or another
   structurally rigid material, e.g., hypodermic stainless steel tubing or the like. For example,
   the needles 100 can be formed from a small biopsy needle or a similar structure. A portion of
   the needle 100 can optionally be coated with a lubricant or low-friction material, such as
10 Teflonu, to further facilitate passage of the needle 100 through the donor site tissue, In
   certain exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, a rotating motion can be applied
   around the longitudinal axis of the needle 100 during insertion to facilitate penetration of the
   needle 100 into the tissue and/or separation and removal of an MTC from the surrounding
   tissue.
15 [0028            Exemplary harvesting needles 100 were formed by grinding angled bevels into
   opposite sides of a surgical steel hypodernic needle to form two points, as illustrated
   schematically in FIGS. IA and 1B, The bevel angle a was about 12', Thin wall hypodermic
   needles of 19 and 22 gauge, and regular-wall needles of 25 and 30 gauge were used. These
   exemplary needles 100 were inserted into samples of pig and human skin tissue to a depth of
20 the subcutaneous fat layer, and the penetration force was measured. The width of the
   resulting harvested MTCs was also measured, Data for this study is summarized in Table I
   below.

   into humrn tissue was about 50-60% of the force needed to insert the same needle into pig
   skin tissue. For typical needle sizes that may be used to harvest skin tissue in humans, the
   force measured to insert a single needle 100 was about 5-6 N. If a plurality of needles 100
   are inserted simultaneously, the total force required would, to a first approximation, be about
 5 5N multiplied by the number of needles 100 being inserted. Such force data can be used,
   eg., to estimate the force requirements for devices having a plurality of harvesting needles
   100, and can also set limits on how many such needles 100 can be inserted using a reasonable
   degree of force.
   100301           A cross-sectional view of a diagram of an apparatus 200 in accordance with
10 certain exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure is shown in. FIG, 2. The exemplary
   apparatus 200 shown in FIG, 2 can include a housing 220 with a fluid conduit 225 provided
   therein. One or more harvesting needles 100 can be coupled to the housing 220. The fluid
   conduit 225 can be provided with at least one funid inlet 230 and at least one fluid outlet 235.
   The fluid conduit 225 can be configured or structured such that a fluid can flow therethrough;
15 e,g. the direction of fluid flow is indicated by the arrows in FIG. 2. A proximal e-nd of the
   needle lumen can be in a fluid communication with the conduit 225. For example, the fluid
   can flow past a proximal end of the harvesting needle 100, as shown in FIG, 2.
   100311           In one exemplary procedure to harvest MTCs 210 from a donor tissue 212, as
   illustrated in FIG 2, the exemplary apparatus 200 can be manipulated such that the distal end
20 of one or more of the harvesting needles 100 penetrate the tissue 212 to a particular depth.
   The depth can be selected and/or controlled, e.g,. by providing or adjusting a particular
   distance between the bottom of the housing 220 and the distal end of the one or more needles
   100. For example, a penetration depth can be selected that extends the distal end of one or
   more of the harvesting needles 100 through the entire local thickness of the dennis to about
25 the depth of the subcutaneous fat layer, or optionally slightly into this fat layer, hiserting the
   needles 100 through the entire thickness of the dermis can provide an MTC 210 that has the
   full length of the debris. Further, such exemplary depth can facilitate a separation of the
   MTC 210 from the surrounding tissue, because the proximal end of the needle 100 can cut
   the MTC 210 away from the adjacent dermal tissue, and the MTC 210 can then be fully
30 detached by tearing a small amount of subcutaneous fat at the bottom of the MTC 210. Such
   fatty tissue may be more easily separable than denser dermal tissue. After the needle 100 is
   withdrawn from the donor site tissue 212, an MTC that wyas separated front the surrounding
   tissue 212 can renai within the lumen of the needle 100,

   100321           The fluid flowing duTough the conduit 225 can reduce pressure at the proximal
   end of the needle 100, which can facilitate removal of the MTC 210 from the lumen of the
   needle 100. The MTC 210 can be entrained in the flowing liquid, and carried through the
   conduit 225 and into a chamber 240. The flowing fluid can be withdrawn from the fiad
 5 outlet 235, which can be provided as part of the chamber 240. 'MTCs that have been
   harvested as described herein can remain in the chamber 240. One or more optional vents
   237 can be provided in an upper portion of the chamber 240 (or conduit 225, if no chamber is
   provided) to allow any air entrained during the harvesting procedure to escape from the
   conduit pathway. e.g., to prevent the chamber 240 from filling with air. For example, a small
10 amount of air may be sucked in through the needle 100 along with an MTC 210 when the
   needle 100 is withdrawn from the donor tissue 212.
   100331           In some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the conduit 225
   can form a closed loop for the fluid flow or otherwise recirculate fluid flowing through the
   apparatus 200. For example, the fluid inlet 230 and outlet 235 shown in FIG, 2 can be
15 connected to the outlet and inlet, respectively, of a fluid pump arrangement (not shown) or
   the like.
   100341           The pump arrangement can be or include an external pump or similar device
   configured to circulate fluid through the conduit 225. The fluid can be provided from one or
   more reservoirs, and the pump arrangement and the conduit 225 can be configured, connected
20 or structured such that the fluid leaving the chamber 240 via the outlet 235 can be discarded.
   In further exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the fluid exiting the outlet 235
   can be recirculated through the conduit 225, e.g. in a closedloop configuratina. One or
   more sensors (e.g, pressure or flow rate sensors - not shown) can optionally be provided in
   the apparatus to facilitate control of the circulating fluid. In certain exemplary embodiments
25 of the present disclosure, the pump arrangement can be or include a peristaltic pump. The
   flowing fluid can facilitate the removal of the MTCs 210 through the hollow needle 100 and
   into the fluid path, where the MTCs 2 10 are surrounded by a gentle fluid environment.
   100351           A "trap" or filter arrangement 250 can be provided in the apparatus to remove
   harvested MTCs 210 from the circulating fluid and hold them for subsequent transfer or

   mesh, woven or porous material, basket, trap, or the like such that the circulating fluid flows
   at least partially through the chamber 240 and the filter element.
    [0036]           A pore size or permeability of the filter arrangement 250 can be selected to
 5 facilitate the fluid flow therethrough while preventing the MTCs 210 from doing so For
   example. the pore size can be less than about 200 microns e ng about 100 microns or less.
   Such exemplary pore sizes can facilitate the flow of the circulating fluid through the filter
   arrangement 250 with a relate vely little restriction, while being small enough to trap and
   retain the MICs 210 that can be suspended in the flowing fluid. Accordingly, the harvested
10 MTCs 210 can be retained in the trap while the fluid can flow therethrough, and exit from the
   filter arrangement 250, e.g. through the outlet 235.
    [0037]           According to certain exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the
   filter arrangement 250 can include a porous dressing with holes or pores sufficiently small to
   trap MTCs 210 while facilitating or allowing the fluid to flow through it, The dressing can be
15 'populated' with MTCs after the exemplary harvesting procedure, and it can be removed
   from the apparatus and applied directly onto a wound site. Such dressing as the filter element
   can be used with ainy of the various embodiments described herein.

   conventional control systems- The fluid can contain a variety of substances including, for
   example, saline, growth factors, buffers, etc. For example, the fluid can contain supplemental
   nutrients such as, e.g, amino acids, glucose, electrolytes, and/or oxygen to promote or help
   maintain viability of the harvested MTCs 210. The fluid can also include or comprise a
10 conventional tissue culture medium, such as Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, F 12, or the
   like, Antibiotics (e.g., penicillin, streptoinyci, or the like) and/or antifungal agents (e.g.
   anphotericin or fliconazole) can optionally be provided in the fluid to help disinfect the
   MTCs 210 after they are removed from the donor site 212.
   100431           In the various exemplary embodiments described herein, the MTCs 210 can be

   include the filter arrangement 250 provided in the chamber 240 where the filter arrangement
   250 can be located between an end of the conduit 225 and the fluid outlet 235 Such
15 configuration facilitates the flow of fluid containing the harvested MTCs 210 through the

   with the fluid conduit 225, the harvesting needle(s) 100, and the fluid inlet 230. The
10 exemplary apparatus 350 illustrated in FIG. 38 can be provided with a delivery arrangement
   360 configured to direct at least a portion of the fluid flowing from the inlet 230 and through
   the conduit 225 onto a receiving substrate 370 (which can be or act as a filter arrangement).
   The delivery arrangement 360 can include rigid and/or flexible tubing, or the like, which can
   be connected to the conduit 225.
15 100501          The reciving substrate 370 can be or include, e.g. a filter element that can
   trap MTCs 210 while allowing fluid froni the conduit 225 to flow through or off of the
   substrate 370. in further exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the substrate 370
   can be or include a permeable or porous dressing material, which can act as a filter element to
   trap MTCs 2 10 thereon while allowing the fluid to pass through or flow off of the substrate
20 370. In this exemplary manner, harvested MTCs 210 can be directly deposited onto a
   dressing or the like, and such dressing with the MTCs 2.10 can then be transported or applied
   directly to a wound site.
   10051]          The distal end of the delivery arrangement 360 can be positionable such that it
   traverses a predetermined. region of the substrate 370 during the resting procedure. eg.
25 while fluid containing MTCs 210 flows through the conduit 225 and out of the distal end of
   the delivery arrangement 360. For example, at least a portion of the delivery arrangement

10 MTCs 210 are deposited in a predetermined spacing, pattern or density on the substrate 370.
   The deposition geometry can be estimated in a straightforward manner based on the
   frequency at which the needle 100 is inserted into tissue to obtain a new MfTC 2107 together
   with the speed and direction of the relative motion between the distal end of the delivery

   not activated. In this exemplary state, the harvesting iedles 100 are retracted so that they
 5 are close to but not protruding from. a lower surface of the base 420. In operation- the base
   420 can be placed on the surface of the donor site tissue 212 to be harvested, with the
   solenoids 430 off; as shown in FIG, 4A, A pimp arrangement or the like (not shown) can be
   activated to supply fluid to the inlet 230 and circulate it through the conduit 225, as described
   herein.
10 [00571          The solenoids 430 can then be activated, such that the cores 435 are drawn
   downward, such that the housing 220 with mechanically coupled needles I 10 are also pulled
   downward with respect to the base 420, as shown in FIG. 4B. This exemplary motion can
   result in the harvesting needles 100 protruding beyond a lower surface of the base 420,
   causing the needles 110 to pierce the tissue 212 of the donor site and separate MTCs 210
15 from the surrounding tissue 212. as described herein. The MTCs 210 can then be withdrawn
   from the needles 100 such that they flow through the conduit 225 with the fluid and can be
   deposited in the filter arrangement 250. The solenoids 430 can then be deactivated, such that
   the housing 220 rises relative to the base 42C) (e.g, using springs or the like to return the
   housing to a raised position) and the needles 110 are withdrawn from the donor site 212 and
20 back into the base 420, as shown in FIG. 4A. This exemplary procedure can be repeated at
   different locations on the donor site 212 to harvest additional MTCs 210, In an exemplary
   operation, such apparatus 400 can be used to harvest the MTCs 210 at a fi-equency between
   about 0,5 and about 2 i, e       with a time interval between successive penetrations of about
   0.5 to 2 seconds. Certain exemplary modifications may be developed to allow faster
25 harvesting rates, and slower rates can also be used if desired.
   [0058]          An adjusting arrangement such as, e.g., a screw-type adjuster or a spacer that
   can be attached to the base 420, can be provided to control the maximurn protrusion length of
   the needles 110 from a lower surface of the base 420 (thereby controlling a corresponding
   maximum penetration depth of the needles 100 into the donor site tissue 2 12),
30 100591          In further exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, other types of
   actuators can be used instead of or in addition to the solenoids 430. For example, one or
   more motors can be provided with a rotary/linear con verter to convert rotary motion to a

   lincar motion of the housing 220 relative to the base 420, e.g at a controlled frequency
   and/or particular excursion distance. Otter types of linear actuators can also be used to
   extend and withdraw the needles 100 from the tissue 212 beneath the apparatus 400.
   [0060]          The base 420 of the exemplary apparatus 400 can be structured to include a
 5 recess 450 that can form an enclosed volume between the tissue surface 212 and a lower
   surface of the base 420 adjacent to the needles 100, as shown in FIG. 4A. Such exemplary
   recess 450 can be formed, e.g by providing the base 420 with a rim or edge that can rest on
   the donor site tissue 212 while a lower surface of the base 420 remains a small distance above
   the tissue surface. One or more vacuum ducts 410 can be provided in communication with
10 the enclosed volume. Application of a low-pressure or vacuum source (not shown) to the
   vacuum duct(s) 410 can cause the surface of the donor site tissue 212 to be pulled up into the
   recess 450, as shown in FIG.4B.
   100611          This exemplary deformation can stretch the surface and provide tension,
   which may provide several benefits- For example, stretching the tissue surface can
15 mechanically stabilize it such that the needles 100 can penetrate the stretched tissue 212 more
   easily than they may penetrate unstretched, resilient tissue. Further. puling the tissue surface
   upward using low pressure such that it contacts a lower surface of the base 420, as shown in
   FIO, 4B, can facilitate an accurate insertion depth of the needles 100, in certain
   embodiments, the needles 100 can be in a fixed position relative to the base 420 such that
20 they remain protruding a small distance from the lower surface, as shown in FIG. 4B.
   100621           Instead of forcing the needles 100 into the tissue 212, as described herein, the
   tissue 212 can be pulled up onto the needles 100 such that they pierce the tissue 212, as
   shown in FIG, 4B, The low pressure can then be released to allow the tissue 212 to relax and
   fall off the needles 110, optionally assisted with a positive pressure being applied to the
25 vacuum ducts 410. An exemplary application of low (and/or optionally high) pressure to the
   vacuum ducts 410 can be done, for example, using a conventional pump arrangement or other
   sources) of low and high pressure, together with an appropriate valve arrangements to
   control the application and release of pressure differences in the ducts 410, The timing of
   such pressure cycles can be coordinated with the activationldeactivation of the solenoids 430,

   100631           According to still funher exemplary eibodiments of the present disclosure,
   the surface of the donor site tissue 212 can be stretched or stabilized using other procedures.
   e.g., by manually stretching the surface with fingertips before inserting the needles 100. In
   yet further exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the donor site tissue 212 can be
 5 pre-cooled or partially frozen prior to insertion of the harvesting needles 100, e.g.. sing
   convective or conductive techniques such as a cryospray or contact with a cooled object The
   exemplary cooling of the donor site tissue 212 can make it more rigid and facilitate insertion
   of the harvesting needles 100. In still further embodiments a mechanical surface clamp or
   spreader can be applied around the donor site region to stretch the tissue 212 before inserting
10 the needles 100. Such procedures can be performed with any of the exemplary devices and
   methods described herein.
   100641           The exemplary apparatuses 2007 300, 350, 400 can be provided with various
   numbers of the harvesting needles 100. For example, in addition to a single one of the
   needles 100, arrays of 4, 6, 8, 9, 12 or more of the needles 100 can be used, and they can be
15 affixed to a hub 310 to facilitate insertion and removal of the needles 100 from the exemplary
   apparatuses 200, 300. 350. 400 as a group. The needles .100 can be provided in various
   geometrical arrangements such as, e.g a square or triangular pattern. Providing a hub with a
   larger number of needles can increase the efficiency and speed of harvesting MTCs 210, as
   more MTCs 210 (one per needle 10(Y) can be harvested with each insertion-and-withdrawal
20 cycle of the needles 100. However, a very large number of needles 100 can increase the
   force required to advance all of the needles 100 into the donor site tissue 212 simultaneously,
   and can increase the complexity of manufacturing the hub-needle component, According still
   additional exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the hub arrangements can have
   between about 4 and 25 needles coupled thereto.
25 100651           The needles 100 can be spaced apart an appropriate distance to facilitate
   harvesting of a large number of the MTCs 210 from a donor site 212 while mainntainiun
   healthy tissue between the removed. tissue samples 210 to proniote rapid healing of the donor
   site 212, prevent formation of scars or markings, etc. For example, the spacing between
   adjacent needles 100 can be about 1-2 mm, or up to about 5 mm. Larger spacings can be
30 used in certain embodiments. but this can require a correspondingly larger width of the
   overall apparatus to accommodate the larger hub. The MTCs 210 can be harvested over a
   larger area of tissue 212 by moving the exemplary apparatuses 200, 300, 350, 400 to different
   locations before each needle insertion procedure.

   100661           The exeiplary embodiments described herein can include the fluid conduit
   225 that is substantially vertical. In further exemplary embodunents of the present
   disclosure, other orientations of the conduit 225 can be provided. For example, the conduit
   can be substantially horizontal, with the inlet 230 and the outlet 235 can be provided at
 5 opposing ends of such a conduit 225, and the proximal ends of the needles 100 protruding
   into the conduit 225 such that the liquid flows past this end of the needles 100. Such an
   exemplary configuration can also provide a simpler, e.g. linear, conduit geometry that may be
   easier to manufacture and/or clean, may result in fewer pressure drops along the fluid path,
   etc. Other exemplary orientations of the conduit 225 or shapes thereof, such as a curved
10 conduit, can also be provided in still further exemplary embodiments of the present
   disclosure,
   100671           According to still additional exemplary embodinents of the present disclosure,
   at least two of the needles 100 can be separately actuated, e.g, such that they pierce the tissue
   212 at different times. For example, two or more actuators can be coupled to different ones
15 of the needles, Alternatively, a singular actuator can be provided that is configured to
   advance different ones of the needles at different times. Such 'staggering' of penetrations
   can reduce the maximum force needed to advance the needles into the tissue.
   100681          Other needle cross-sectional shapes can be used with the various embodiments
   described herein to harvest the MTCs 210 having different geometric characteristics.
20 Although circular cross-sections are most common, needles I00 having oval, square, or
   triangular cross-sections, or combinations thereof in multi-needle devices, can also be used.
   100691           Itn further embodiments of the present disclosure, the methods and apparatus
   described herein can be applied to other tissues besides skin tissue. Thus, the MTCs 210 can
   be harvested from a variety of organs or tissue structures, which can facilitate rapid healing of
25 a donor site while providing microscopic graft tissue suitable for placement at recipient sites,
   on scaffolds. within biocompatible matrices, etc.
