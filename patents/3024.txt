       METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR CONTAINER CODE RECOGNITION
            CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS AND PRIORITY
        [0001] This patent application claims priority to Indian Specification (Title: Method and
System for Container Code Recognition) No. <removed-apn>86, filed in India on December 16,
2016.
                                          TECHNICAL FIELD
        [0002] The present application generally relates to character detection and recognition.
Particularly, the application provides a method and system for container code recognition via
Spatial Transformer Networks and Connected Component.
                                        BACKGROUND
        [0003] Millions of ship containers are transported to and from the worlds' shipping ports
every day. Accurate book-keeping of these containers is vital to ensure timely arrival and
dispatch of goods for trade. Each container is granted a unique identification serial code, which
is manually recorded when the container arrives at or leaves a port.
        [0004] An automated system for reading of container codes from camera would be faster,
cheaper and more reliable. However, automated reading and recording of container numbers at
human performance levels has been a challenge due to the corrugated container surface, different
background layouts, and variations in colors, font types, sizes, illumination, blur, orientations
and other photometric distortions. The corrugated surface, in particular, implies that the character
and font is distorted owing to a 2D projection from a 3D object, causing standard OCR
techniques to perform poorly. Other challenges include rust on the container, mud, peeling paint

James & Wells Ref: 308437AU
and external factors such as varying lighting conditions, rain, fog, snow which affect the contrast
of the grabbed vehicle or container images.
        [0005] The performance of conventional image processing based methods for locating
the container code regions which are recognized using a SVM classifier depends heavily on the
positioning of the camera capturing the container image. Moreover, majority of prior art teaches
methods and systems that use multiple modalities like vision and RFIDs for identification which
have installation costs. The efficacy of existing methods for container code recognition where
texts are printed on a corrugated surface still remains question. Additionally, none of these
methods are capable of dynamically adapting to distortions like Spatial Transformation Network.
                                            SUMMARY

         [0027] The present application provides a computer implemented method and system for
container code recognition via Spatial Transformer Networks and Connected Component.
         [0028] Referring now to Fig. 1, a network implementation 100 of a system 102 for
container code recognition via Spatial Transformer Networks and Connected Component is
illustrated, in accordance with an embodiment of the present subject matter. Although the present
subject matter is explained considering that the system 102 is implemented on a server, it may be
understood that the system 102 may also be implemented in a variety of computing systems,
such as a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a notebook, a workstation, a mainframe
computer, a server, a network server, and the like. In one implementation, the system 102 may be
implemented in a cloud-based environment. In another embodiment, it may be implemented as
custom built hardware designed to efficiently perform the invention disclosed. It will be
understood that the system 102 may be accessed by multiple users through one or more user
devices 104-1, 104-2... 104-N, collectively referred to as user devices 104 hereinafter, or
applications residing on the user devices 104. Examples of the user devices 104 may include, but
are not limited to, a portable computer, a personal digital assistant, a handheld device, and a
workstation. The user devices 104 are communicatively coupled to the system 102 through a
network 106.
         [0029] In one implementation, the network 106 may be a wireless network, a wired
network or a combination thereof. The network 106 can be implemented as one of the different
types of networks, such as intranet, local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the
internet, and the like. The network 106 may either be a dedicated network or a shared network.
The shared network represents an association of the different types of networks that use a variety
of protocols, for example, Hypertext        Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Transmission Control
                                                 9

James & Wells Ref: 308437AU
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), and the like, to
communicate with one another. Further the network 106 may include a variety of network
devices, including routers, bridges, servers, computing devices, storage devices, and the like.
         [0030] In one embodiment the present invention, referring to Fig. 2, describes a detailed
working of the various components of the system (102). The system (102) comprises a processor
(202), a memory (204) and an image capture device (200) operatively coupled with said
processor. The image capturing device (200) is configured to capture an image of a container
such that the captured image contains the container identification code.
         [0031] The system (102)      further comprises an image preprocessing module (210)
configured to pre-process the captured image. In an embodiment image preprocessing may
comprise resizing the images to double their original size and binarize them to separate the
characters such as to enable easy distillation via connected component (CC) for generating
region proposal.
         [0032] The system further comprises a region extraction module (212) configured to
extract and filter region proposals from the pre-processed image to generate regrouped region
proposals. In an embodiment extracting region proposal comprises extracting using the CC
region proposals proposal such that the region proposal conforms to a predefined container
identification code such that extraction of every character in the container code.
         [0033] Further the region extraction module (212) configured to filter the extracted
region proposal to generated filtered region proposals such that the filtered region proposals have
lesser false positives due to false positive elimination on the basis of height similarity to get
clusters containing characters of similar heights. In an embodiment where the container code is
an IS06346 code, using the predefined structure of the ISO code containing fifteen characters
                                                 10

James & Wells Ref: 308437AU
and their bounding boxes being of approximately equal height (as illustrated in Fig 4), the false
positives may be filtered out of the region-proposals by clustering the region proposals on the
basis of height similarity to get clusters containing characters of similar heights. Subsequently,
the clusters which contain less than fifteen region proposals may be discarded for ISO code. Post
this of the noise (non-text region proposals) gets filtered out and clusters containing fifteen or
more region proposals are processed further.
         [0034] Further the region extraction module regroups grouping to preserve the spatial
position and sequence of region-proposals of similar heights. In an embodiment where the
characters of the container identification code are written spatially close to each other, in fixed
horizontal or vertical patterns search is conducted for groups with those patterns and identify
windows around potential code characters.
         [0035] The system (102) as disclosed herein further comprises a classification module
(214) configured to classifying the regrouped region proposals into characters by implementing
trained Spatial Transformation Network (STN) to generate a valid group of region proposal with
more than one chunk of container identification code. In an embodiment classification comprises
classifying grouped region proposals to characters via trained STNs such that STNs comprises
STNaip and STNdig for identifying alphabets and digits respectively. Since the container
identification code is a predefined code have a predefined structure the relevant STN can be
implemented at relevant STN to get appropriate output from the appropriate classifier at runtime.
         [0036] Further in one aspect the classification module may be configured to match the
output of both STNs to a container identification code directory comprising plurality of pre
defined standard container identification      codes. In an embodiment where the container
identification code is an ISO code and the directory is an ISO directory, the set whose first four
                                                  11

James & Wells Ref: 308437AU
characters matches with any entry of ISO Code Directory is selected and the rest may be
discarded.
         [0037] It may be noted that the STNs used by the system (102) are pre trained STNs
separately for alphabets and digits.
         [0038] The system disclosed herein further comprises a code identification module (216)
configured to determine the container code by generating a sequence for the valid group of
region proposal and mapping the generated sequence to a predefined standard container
identification code wherein the predefined standard identification code comprises chunks of
characters in a predefined pattern.
         [0039] In an embodiment the code identification module (216) uses the character counts
and heuristics over spatial position of groups to generate the sequence for the valid group.
Further the number of region proposals inside each matching group are checked and
determination as to requirement of more group may be made. Further the existing information
regarding the predefined container identification code may be used to extract the code. . In an
embodiment where the container identification code is an ISO code, the ISO code information
may be used to determine the container identification code such that a) If the first group has 15
region proposals, then it means that this group contains all the three chunks of ISO code, i.e., all
the 15 characters of the ISO code and it is written in single line (horizontally / vertically).
Therefore, this group may be selected as the final output group. b) If there are 11 region
proposals in the first group, then this implies that this group contains the first two chunks of the
ISO code. Then the third chunk by may be searched by finding the nearest group having exactly
4 region proposals in the same (horizontal or vertical) pattern and identifying this group as the
final group. c) If the matching group has four character region proposals, then it means this
                                                  12

James & Wells Ref: 308437AU
group is the first chunk of the ISO code, then the remaining two chunks are searched by
searching for groups containing at least seven characters (corresponding to the second chunk)
and so on. This process may similarly be implemented for various different container
identification code based on similar characteristic.
          [0040] After the above mentioned analysis is performed using the code identification
module as a result, final group are identified. In case of ISO codes the number of final groups we
get here may be either 1, 2 or 3. If it is 1, it means that it has all the 15 characters of ISO code. If
it is 2, it means that one of the two groups has one chunk and other group has two chunks of ISO
code. If it is 3, it means that every group has one chunk of ISO code. Similar analysis is be made
for various other container identification code based on characteristics for the code.
          [0041] The above final output is then mapped to the STN output to generate a sequence
of code which is determined as the container identification code of the container. In an
embodiment where the container identification code is an ISO code the ISO Code pattern as
shown in Fig. 5 is used to decide the type of STN to apply for recognition of each one of 15
region proposals. The first four characters are recognized using STNaip, next seven characters are
recognized using STNdig, next two again using STNdig, and the final two characters via STNaip
and STNdig respectively. The combination leads to the final output i.e. the 15 character ISO code
written over the container body.
          [0042] In an embodiment where the system (102) is unable is identify the container code
after the processing mentioned herein the system may trigger an alert signifying that a container
code was not determined by the system. The code identification module (216) may be configured
to trigger such alert.

         [0043] Referring now to Fig. 3 a flow chart illustrating the method for method for
container code recognition via Spatial Transformer Networks and Connected Component is
shown. The process starts at step 302 where an image of a container is captured using an image
capture device wherein the image contains the container identification code.
         [0044] At the step 304 the captured image is pre-processed using an image preprocessing
module. In an aspect preprocessing may comprise resizing the images to double their original
size and binarize them to separate the characters such as to enable easy distillation via connected
component (CC) for generating region proposal.
         [0045] At the step 306 the method comprises extracting and filtering region proposals

308   method comprises classifying the regrouped region proposals              into characters   by
implementing trained Spatial Transformation Network (STN) to generate a valid group of region
proposal with more than one chunk of container identification code.
         [0046] Lastly at the step 310 a container identification code is determined by generating

method may further comprise the step of trigger an alert signifying that no container code is
determined after implementing the method.

method disclosed herein may further comprise validating the determined ISO (container
identification code) code using the checksum digit for ISO 6346 code.

         [0049] The following paragraphs contain experimental results which are intended to
illustrate the working of the proposed system and method and its efficiency and accuracy. The
implementation of the system and method as disclosed in the following paragraphs is one of
many and they may not be taken as limiting the scope of the instant invention, which is limited
only by the following claims.
         [0050] The experiments were conducted on a server equipped with an Intel Xeon(R)
processor and an NVIDIA Quadro 4000 GPU with 40GB of RAM. The proposed method takes
approx. 2.47 seconds per container image for recognition of the complete container code using
the aforementioned hardware specifications. It should be noted here that all the experiments were
conducted on different datasets and are, therefore, not directly comparable.
         [0051] Despite direct comparison not being possible, the size of the dataset is kept very
similar to the sizes mentioned in the prior references and we chose the test set to be as difficult
and varied in terms of camera angle, size, occlusion, and color. Table I below shows accuracy
results for character detection, recognition and full code extraction by the proposed invention.

         [0052] Nineteen test images of containers comprising of 280 character windows of
IS06346 code were used. The disclosed inventions method is able to detect all the 280 character
windows from 19 test images of container, i.e. 100% coverage for text detection was achieved.
Further all but one character were determined correctly, i.e., an accuracy of 99:64%. Hence

James & Wells Ref: 308437AU
accuracy on detecting the complete container code was 95% with the method able to recognize
the complete correct code of 18 out 19 images.
         [0053] For benchmarking, Tesseract3 recognition engine is employed on test image set
which achieved 38.57% accuracy, i.e. only 108 out of 280 characters were recognized correctly.
Also FasterRCNN detector when evaluated on the test images achieved average recognition
accuracy of 48%, with 43% and 51.50% for alphabets and characters respectively illustrating the
efficient and robust nature of the instant invention.
