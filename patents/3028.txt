                    Apparatus and Method for User Exercise Monitoring
   Cross Reference
   The present application is a divisional application from Australian patent application
 5 No. 2014323207 filed 12 September 2014, the entire disclosure of which is taken to
   be incorporated by reference.
   Technical Field
   The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for user exercise
10 monitoring. Such monitoring may be conducted in the context of rehabilitation
   following an illness, injury or medical procedure.
   Background
   A reference herein to a patent document or other matter which is given as prior art is
15 not to be taken as an admission that that document or matter was known or that the
   information it contains was part of the common general knowledge as at the priority
   date of any of the claims.
   Where any or all of the terms "comprise", "comprises", "comprised" or "comprising"
20 are used in this specification (including the claims) they are to be interpreted as
   specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps or components, but not
   precluding the presence of one or more other features, integers, steps or
   components.
25 Patients suffering from injury or recovering from medical procedures or surgical
   interventions typically undergo a period of recovery and rehabilitation. Joint
   replacement surgery is one example of a medical procedure following which a period
   of rehabilitation is necessary. Following initial in-patient assessment and rehabilitation
   treatment, a patient is typically prescribed a series of exercises in order to continue
30 the rehabilitation process in their own home. Away from the close medical supervision
   provided in a hospital environment, many patients struggle with the completion of
   such exercise programs, failing to conduct the exercises correctly, if at all. The
   supervising medical practitioner, typically a physiotherapist, is reliant upon the patent
   for information concerning how the exercises have been performed in order to monitor

                                                 1a
   and tailor the exercise program to the patient's progress. Information provided by the
   patient may in some cases be incomplete or inaccurate, complicating the task of the
   supervising practitioner. Similar difficulties may be experienced during rehabilitation
   following a stroke or other illnesses or medical procedures.

   Personal monitoring devices are well known in the fitness industry, enabling the
   capture of relevant information during or after performance of certain activities. The
   information captured may concern a user's physical state, as in the case for example
   of heart rate and breathing monitors, or may relate to the activity conducted, as in
10 motion trackers such as pedometers. Advances in sensing and communication
   technology have resulted in considerable expansion of this market, and in the
   development of a new generation of high performance activity trackers, designed to
   be continuously worn by a user. Activity trackers track the movement of a user and
   connect over wired or wireless links to a user's computer, Smartphone or other device
15 in order to display the captured information. Such devices are primarily targeted
   towards the active adult population, providing insight for a user into their fitness and
   activity levels and acting as a motivational tool in achieving increased activity levels.

    Detailed Description
20  Referring initially to Figures 1 and 2, an apparatus 2 for user exercise monitoring
    comprises a frame 4, on which are mounted additional apparatus components. A
    harness 6 in the form of a strap 8 is configured to secure the frame 4 to a body part of
    a user, for example to a limb of a user. Mounted on the frame 4 are a motion sensing
    unit 10, user input unit 12 and feedback unit 14. Also mounted on the frame 4 are a
25  processing unit 16 and a memory 18.
    Referring also to Figures 3 to 6, the frame 4 comprises an arcuate base potion 20 with
    a cylindrical support 22 protruding from a central region of the base portion 20. The
    cylindrical support is substantially hollow, with supporting ribs 24 extending across the
30   base of the cylindrical support 22 to define ventilation holes 26. A series of fins 28
    extend radially inward from the internal circumference of the cylindrical support 22.
    The fins 28 are substantially evenly spaced around the inner circumference and divide
    the inner circumference into 20 substantially equal open segments 116, each suitable
    to receive an individual LED as explained in further detail below. A watertight circular
35   bearing 30 is received over the cylindrical support 22 to rest on the base portion 20 of
    the frame 4 and is held in place by snap fit connectors 32 protruding from an outer

   WO 2015/039979                                                        PCT/EP2014/069571
                                                   6
    circumference of the cylindrical support 22 The bearing 30 supports rotational
     movement of an element of the user input unit 12, as discussed in further detail below.
    Opposite ends of the base portion 20 of the frame 4 comprise longitudinal openings 34
    extending across the width of the frame, suitable to receive opposing ends of the strap
 5  8. In use, opposing ends 36 of the strap 8 pass through the openings 34 before folding
    back to be secured to the body of the strap, as described in further detail below as
    illustrated in Figure 1. Velcro ® or other quick release fastening may be applied to
    allow the ends 36 of the strap 8 to be securely attached to the main body of the strap 8
    after passing through the openings 34 in the frame 4.
10
    On a side of the frame 4 opposite to the cylindrical support 22 (a lower side as viewed
    in the Figures), a circuit board 38 and battery 40 are secured to the frame 4. The
    circuit board 38 is received immediately under the supporting ribs 24 with the battery
    40 received below the circuit board 38. The battery 40 comprises two battery units,
15  each of which is received in a housing 42 defined in the frame and held in position via a
    snap connection 44. Additional supporting fins 46 impart rigidity to the frame in the
    region between the battery housing 42 and opposing ends defining the openings 34.
    Referring particularly to Figure 3, the circuit board 38 comprises a series of functional
20  units which may be realised in a combination of hardware and/or software. In the
    illustrated example, many of the functional units are realized as application specific
    integrated circuits, as described below. A first functional unit mounted on the circuit
    board comprises the motion sensing unit 10. In the illustrated example, the motion
    sensing unit comprises a 3-axis accelerometer and a 2 axis gyroscope configured to
25  sense linear and rotational acceleration of the apparatus 2. The accelerometer and
    gyroscope are mounted on the circuit board 38, and the circuit board 38 is mounted on
    the frame 4, such that, once the apparatus 2 is attached to a user body part, the axes
    of the accelerometer and gyroscope will be aligned with the principle axes of the user
    body. The motion sensing unit 10 is configured to send the output of the sensing
30  elements comprised within the unit 10 to the processing unit 16. Suitable sampling
    rates, time intervals and measurement resolution may be selected for the
    measurement sensing unit 10, as discussed in further detail below.
    Other functional units mounted on the circuit board 28 include the processing unit 16
35  and the memory 18. The processing unit 16 comprises a microprocessor and is
    configured to manage operation of the apparatus according to procedures outlined

   WO 2015/039979                                                       PCT/EP2014/069571
                                                7
    below with reference to Figure 9. The memory 18 comprises a rewritable flash memory
    and may be sized according to the likely amount of data to be stored and the time for
    which data is to be retained before being downloaded to anther location. The circuit
    board 38 additionally supports a mini USB port 48, enabling connection via a USB
 5  cable to a computer for downloading and uploading of data onto the memory 18. An
    opening 50 in the frame 40 allows access to the mini USB port 48.
    The frame 4, bearing 30, circuit board 38 and battery 40 are substantially encased by a
    housing 52 comprising an upper housing unit 54, a lower housing unit 56 and, in the
10  example of Figure 2, side support units 58. The upper housing unit 54 comprises a
    circular opening 60 and is received over the cylindrical support 22 of the frame 4,
    allowing the support 22 to protrude through the opening 44. The upper housing unit 54
    extends away from the opening 60 to engage the frame 4. A side opening 62 in the
    upper housing unit 36 aligns with the opening 50 on the frame 4 to allow access to the
15  mini USB port 48. In the example illustrated in Figure 2 the upper housing unit 54
    engages opposing ends of the frame 4 via the side support units 58. In other
    examples, (as shown in Figures 1 and 6), the upper housing unit 54 substantially
    directly engages the opposing ends of the frame 4 and the side support units are not
    present. The lower housing unit 56 engages the 40 against a lower side the frame 4.
20  The lower housing unit 56 also provides the lower surface of the apparatus 2, and as
    such offers a smooth surface for engagement with a user body part. Additional rigidity
    may be imparted to the housing units though high density foam components 64,
    shaped to fit between the frame 4 and attached components and the housing units 54,
    56. Connections between the housing units 54, 56 and the frame 4 may be seen in
25  Figure 6. Upper and lower housing units are directly connected at join 66 along the
    sides of the apparatus 2. This connection may for example be by ultrasonic welding.
    The upper and lower housing units 54, 56 are connected to the frame at joins 68. The
    upper housing unit 54 and frame 4 are additionally connected at join 70 in the region of
    the bearing 30.
30
    The user input unit 12 is mounted in the opening 60 of the upper housing unit 54,
    supported by the bearing 30. The user input unit 12 comprises a continuous input
    device 72 and a discrete input device 74. The continuous input device may comprise a
    linear or a rotary device, and may comprise a displaceable element and a displacement
35  measurement element. The displacement measurement element may for example be
    a potentiometer or encoder.

   WO 2015/039979                                                         PCT/EP2014/069571
                                                  8
     In the illustrated example, the continuous input device 72 is a rotary device comprising
    a displaceable element in the form of a turn knob 76 and a displacement measurement
    element in the form of an optical incremental rotary encoder 78. Referring in particular
 5  to Figures 4. 7 and 8, the turn knob 76 comprises an annular component having inner
    and outer skirts 80, 82 joined by an upper annularface 84. The cylindrical support 22
    of the frame 4 is received between the inner and outer skirts 80, 82. An inner surface
    of the outer skirt 82 comprises an annular shoulder 86 which is slidingly received on
    the bearing 30. Feedback ribs 88 formed on the outer circumferential surface of the
10  cylindrical support 22 provide mild resistance to rotation of the turn knob 76, so
    providing haptic feedback during rotation of the knob 76 and acting to prevent
    accidental rotation. The inner skirt 80 of the knob 76 comprises an inwardly extending
    annular shelf 90. A slotted skirt 92 extends axially downward from an inner edge of the
    shelf 90. The slotted skirt 92 comprises a series of evenly spaced axial openings or
15  slots 94 extending from a lower (as seen in the Figures) edge of the slotted skirt
    towards the shelf 90.
    The incremental rotary encoder 78 comprises an infra red (IR) LED and a double IR
    sensor 98. With the turn knob 76 received in place on the bearing 30, the IR LED 96
20  and sensor 98 are mounted on opposite sides of the slotted skirt 92, with the IR LED
    96 protruding through a hole 118 in the frame 4. Radiation emitted by the IR LED 96 is
     received at the sensor 98 via the slots 94 in the skirt 92. As the turn knob 76 is rotated,
    the interruptions in received IR radiation at the sensor generate a pulse which is
    conveyed to the processing unit 16, enabling the amount and direction of rotation to be
25  determined. The incremental nature of the encoder formed by the IR LED 96 and
     sensor 98 results in an input device having no maximum or minimum position, merely
     registering an amount and direction of angular displacement of the turn knob 76.
    The discrete input device 74 of the user input unit 12 comprises a push button 100
30  which is received within the central opening of the annular turn knob 76. The push
     button comprises a planar disc 102 and stem 104 which extends from a central point of
     a lower face of the disc 102. The stem 104 engages ribs 106 extending from the
     support ribs 24 of the frame 4. The stem 104 and ribs 106 form a snap fit connection
     108 that maintains the push button 100 in the central opening of the turn knob 76. The
35   ribs 106 receive the stem 104 directly above a receptor 110 mounted on the circuit
     board 38. Pushing the push button 100 forces the stem into contact with the receptor

     shelf 90 of the turn knob 76 and engages a lower face of the disc 102 of te push
 5   button 100. The stem 104 and 0-ing 112 are sized such that the push0- button 100 is
     slghtly recessed with respect to the turn knob 76 An upper face of the disc 102 of the
     push button 100 m-ay be suitab-le to receive branding or other printed or engraved
     material 114.

     user input unit 12 may direct the user input unit towards the head of the user making
    the apparatus 2 more convenient to interact with when in position particularly if the
15   apparatus 2 is mounted on the leg of a patient
    The feedback unit 14 of the apparatus 2 cmrssa bank of lightIn sources. In the
     illustrated example the light sources comprise LEDs, mounted in a circular array
     immediately below the upper annuar face 84 of the turn knob 76& This upper annular
20  fe      is translucent, hus alwng light emitted by the LEDs to be seen by a uer
     through the annU        feC of the tun knob 76 Translucency may be achieved through

     In use, the apparatus 2 functions as a standalrone monitoring device that enables user

     or Smrpoe The user may iteact wiT the apparatus 2 using the input unit 12 and

15   scenaro is expand below , followed by a detailed discussion of the processing
     supporting this functionaity
     The apparatus 2 may in one example scena-,riot be used by a rehabiliation patient wi
     cooperation with a medical practitioner- such as a physiotherapist. The physiotherapi

     patient in their own home. These exercises mray comprise a)series of mocvement.s to be
     perfonmed by the patent for example forward rearWard and lateral l          raises for a
     patent recovering from hip replacement surgery Each exercise nay be defined by the
       nea and angular acceleration to be experienced by the leg during correct
25   performance of the exercise. Values for the nean and standard deviation of the near
     and anguar acceleration corresponding to each exercise prescribe for the patent may
     be recorded in the memory of the apparatus 2, This is one example of how a patern of
     miotion corresponding to a sigle exercise may be digially represented o~n the m,emory
      18 of the apparatus 2. Other examples may be envisaged. Each exercise in the
30   patients pscribed progrm may be stored in Trthe emory, as its repr-esentative mrotion
     pattern together with the number of repetitons of the exercise to be conducted by     o. the
     patie,nt each day. Correct performa-nnce of the prescribed exerc-ises, as well as
     operation of the apparats 2 may be explained to the patent before the patient is sent
     home to co         tthe program of exercises in ther own homeaway Rom T            direct

   WO 2015/039979                                                             PCT/EP2014/069571
                                                    11
    When the patient is ready to conduct the exercises in their home, the patient first
    attaches the apparatus 2 to the appropriate limb using the strap 8. The strap 8 is
    passed around the limb of the patient, the two ends 36 of the strap 8 being passed
    through their respective openings 34 and folded back to fasten against the encircling
 5  portion of the strap 8     It is envisaged that Velcro ® or a similar fastening mechanism
    may be used, allowing for considerable adjustment to accommodate different limb
    circumferences. Such a system offers the advantage of combining both attachment
    and adjustment of the strap in a single action. In the case of a patient requiring
    rehabilitation of a lower limb, the apparatus 2 offers the additional advantage that it
10  may be attached to the lower limb with the patient in a sifting position, without requiring
    significant flexibility or dexterity on the part of the patient.
    Once the apparatus 2 is comfortably attached to the limb, the patient commences the
    first exercise of their assigned program. As the patient moves their limb with the
15  attached apparatus 2, the accelerometer and gyroscope of the motion sensing unit 10
    sense the motion of the limb and the processing unit 16 calculates the mean and
    standard deviation and then compares the sensed motion pattern to the motion
    patterns stored in the memory 18. Suitable sampling rates, time intervals and
    measurement resolution may be selected for the accelerometer and gyroscope to
20  facilitate exercise recognition. The k-nearest neighbour algorithm may also be used to
    assist with pattern recognition. Ifthe processing unit 16 recognises the sensed motion
    pattern as resembling a stored motion pattern corresponding to an assigned exercise
    of the patient program, the processing unit 16 causes the array of feedback LEDs to
    glow an assigned colour (for example green). In some examples, the timing of the
25  glow may be matched to the motion of an exercise. For example, if the exercise
    comprises lateral leg raises, the feedback LEDs may glow progressively as the leg is
    raised and fade as the leg is lowered. In this manner the patient is reassured that they
    are conducting the exercise approximately correctly, as their motion is sufficiently close
    to the stored motion pattern for the exercise to have been recognised. If at any time
30  this exercise recognition feedback stops, this indicates that the motion pattern no
    longer matches the stored pattern, and the patient is reminded to check that they are
    still conducting the exercise properly. Ifthe apparatus 2 additionally comprises an
    audible feedback device such as a buzzer this may be used to provide alternative or
    additional exercise recognition feedback, ensuring that the patient may receive this
35  feedback even when the exercise results in the apparatus being out of view or difficultly
    visible by the patient (for example during rear leg raises). Each completed repetition of

   WO 2015/039979                                                         PCT/EP2014/069571
                                                   12
    an exercise is stored in the memory 18 along with a time stamp and the degree of
    accuracy with which the exercise was conducted, i.e. the extent to which the sensed
    motion pattern matched the stored motion pattern. The threshold level for pattern
    similarity allowing exercise recognition may be adjusted to require a greater or lesser
 5  degree of accuracy in conducting an exercise before the exercise is recognized.
    In some embodiments, the processing unit 16 may cause the number of LEDs
    providing exercise recognition feedback to represent the proportion of the allotted
    program of exercises so far completed. For example, if the program consists of a total
10  of 20 repetitions, 10 repetitions of each of two different exercises, and the LED bank
    comprises 10 bi-colour feedback LEDs, the processing unit 16 may cause a single LED
    to glow providing exercise recognition feedback for the first two repetitions. For the
    third and fourth repetition, both the originally glowing LED and a neighboring LED may
    be caused to glow in synchronisation with the completing of the exercises. The LEDs
15  may be progressively illuminated as the repetitions are completed, showing the patient
    at a glance how far through the day's assigned program of exercises he or she has
    progressed. This progression feedback may also be requested by the patient during a
    pause in activity by pushing the push button 100. Depression of the push button 100
    when an exercise is not taking place may be interpreted as a request for progression
20  feedback, and the processing unit 16 may case an appropriate number of LEDs to glow
    their assigned colour (for example green) to demonstrate the proportion of the day's
    prescribed exercises that have been completed.
    During completion of any exercise the patient may provide feedback to the apparatus
25  2 via the input unit 12. This may be particularly advantageous in allowing the user to
    indicate a level of pain or discomfort experienced during completion of the exercise.
    The pain or discomfort experienced during particular exercises can provide valuable
    insight to the supervising physiotherapist as to the progress of the rehabilitation. By
    enabling the patient to provide that feedback during completion of the exercises, the
30  apparatus contributes to gathering and storing relevant information on which the
    supervising physiotherapist may base further treatment.
    A level of pain or discomfort may be input by the patient by turning the rotary knob 76
    during or shortly after completion of an exercise     When turning of the rotary knob 76 is
35  registered by the rotary encoder 78 the pulse generated by the encoder 78 is
    transmitted to the processing unit 16 which causes the bi-colour LEDs to illuminate in

   WO 2015/039979                                                          PCT/EP2014/069571

    their second colour (for example blue) according to the amount of rotation detected.
     The more the rotary knob 76 is turned, the greater the number of illuminated LEDs,
     indicating a greater degree of pain. The LEDs are progressively illuminated in either a
     clockwise or anticlockwise direction, according to the direction in which the rotary knob
 5   is turned, thus allowing for both left and right handed patients. After an initial rotation in
     a first direction, causing illumination of an appropriate number of LEDs, should the
     rotary knob 76 be rotated back in an opposite direction to the initial rotation, the
     illuminated LEDs are progressively turned off. The patient may thus adjust the amount
    of rotation to indicate precisely the level of discomfort they are feeling from a minimum
10   level of zero pain (no turning of the rotary knob 54 and hence no LEDs illuminated) to a
     maximum level of pain (all LEDs illuminated). Once the patient is satisfied that the
     proportion of LEDs lit accurately reflects his or her level of discomfort, the patient
     presses the push button 100 to register the pain input, at which point the pain level is
    saved in the memory 18 along with a time stamp, allowing the pain input to be matched
15  to the exercise being conducted at the time the pain input was provided. The step of
     pressing the push button 100 to register pain feedback from the patient ensures that
    any accidental rotation of the knob is not mistaken for pain feedback, as well as
    allowing time for the patient to adjust the pain level to accurately reflect their
    experience before it is saved in the memory 18.
20
     Once the patient has finished exercising they may remove the apparatus 2 until the
     next exercise session. In some examples, the apparatus 2 may incorporate a reminder
    function, causing the LEDs to glow on and off periodically even when no motion is
    sensed, so as to remind the patient that the exercise program for the current day has
25   not yet been conducted. Pressing of the push button 100 during the reminder may
    "snooze" or cancel the reminder. If at any time the patient notices the battery feedback
     LED glowing red, the patient knows to place the apparatus 2 on charge for example via
     a suitable USB cable and charger. Ifthe patient notices the memory LED glowing red,
    this suggests that at the next appointment with the physiotherapist, the patient data
30   should be downloaded to a computer or other suitable device and deleted from the
     memory, to free up additional capacity. During data download, the battery may
     additionally be recharged using the computer or other device's power source. In view
     of the need for physiotherapist to download data from the apparatus memory, it is
    envisaged that the memory LED would start to indicate low memory well before the
35   memory is actually exhausted

     provided    The amount of turn knob rotation required for each new LED to be
     illuminated may be selected to facilitate maximum ease of use    For example. a single
    complete revolution of the turn knob 76 may equate to all of the feedback LEDs being
    illuminated, i e. maximum pain level    For a bank of 10 LEDs, this equates to a rotation
 5  of 36 degrees per illuminated LED, and represents a balance between the motor
    control required in the user to manipulate the turn knob accurately and the speed with
    which the user may navigate from minimum to maximum pain input.
    The LEDs are lit in sequence from a first LED until the appropriate number of LEDs is
10  lit to represent the amount of rotation registered. The processing unit 16 then starts a
    timer in step 210 and checks for expiry of the timer in step 212. Ifthe timer has not yet
    reached a threshold value (Yes in step 212) then the processing unit 16 checks for
    registering of depression of the push button 100 in step 214. While no pressing of the
    push button 100 has been registered, the processing unit 16 continues to check for
15  expiry of the timer (No in step 214 and Yes in step 212). Ifthe timer expires before the
    push button 100 is pressed (No in step 212) then the feedback LEDs are turned off in
    step 216 and the process flow breaks. Ifthe push button 100 is pressed before the
    timer expires (Yes in step 214) then the user input is registered by printing the number
    of illuminated LEDs at step 218 and writing this data to the memory 18 in step 220
20  along with a time stamp of the time at which the push button 100 was pressed to
    register the user input. Following printing of the number of illuminated LEDs at step
    218, the LEDs are turned off in sequence until the last LED (the first to be lit) is blinked
    for an interval of for example three seconds at step 222 before also being turned off at
    step 224. Having completed registering of the patient input, the process flow then
25  breaks to return to the start.
    From the start step 202, in a step 226, the processing unit 16 determines whether or
    not the push button 100 has been pressed. Ifthe push button 100 has not been
    pressed (No in step 226) the process flow breaks. Ifthe push button 100 has been
30  pressed, the processing unit 16 checks the record of completed exercise repetitions for
    the day, compares this to the stored patient program in the memory and maps the
    proportion of the program which has been completed to the number of feedback LEDs
    in step 228. The processing unit then lights the mapped number of feedback LEDs in
    sequence at step 230 and blinks the last LED to be lit for a time interval of for example
35  3 seconds, indicating to the user the proportion of exercise repetitions completed for

    the present day. After the time interval has expired al LEDs are switched off at step
    232 and the process flow breaks to return to the start.
    From the start step 202, in a step 234 the accelerometer and gyroscope of the motion
 5  sensing unit 10 sense motion of the apparatus 2. The processing unit 16 then
    conducts exercise recognition in steps 236 to 244. In step 236 the sensed data is
    written into an array appropriate to the sample size selected for the accelerometer and
    gyroscope. In step 238, the mean and standard deviation for each axis are calculated
    and these are then compared to the motion patterns of the stored exercises in the
10  memory 18 at step 240. The comparison is conducted by subtracting the mean and
    standard deviations of the sensed data from the mean and standard deviation values
    for the motion patterns of each of the stored exercises. Each exercise comparison
    produces a results value and the lowest of these values is selected in step 242. Owing
    to the subtraction calculation. the lowest results value represents the stored exercise
15  which most closely resembles the sensed motion pattern. In step 244 this lowest value
    is compared to a threshold value representing exercise recognition. If the value is not
    below the threshold (No at step 244) then the sensed exercise pattern is not sufficiently
    similar to any of the stored exercise patterns to be recognised as one of the stored
    exercises    The process flow then breaks and returns to the start at step 202. If the
20  lowest value is below the threshold value (Yes at step 244) then the sensed exercise
    has been recognised as the stored exercise corresponding to the lowest comparison
    value. The exercise number of this exercise is printed in step 246 and the feedback
    LEDs are temporarily illuminated an appropriate colour (for example green) in step 248
    The counter for the recognised exercise is then increased by 1 in step 250 before the
25  process flow breaks and returns to the start. It will be appreciated that the exercise
    counter that is updated at step 250 is used in step 228 to assemble the total number of
    completed exercises for the day and compare this to the stored patient program.
    The flow chart of Figure 9 illustrates an example in which progress feedback is given
30  after each exercise repetition. After a recognized exercise has been completed for a
    single repetition, and the exercise counter has been increased by one at step 250, the
    processing unit proceeds to steps 228, 230 and 232 in which the daily progress
    through the stored program is calculated and represented to the user through
    illumination of the appropriate proportion of feedback LEDs.    In other examples, (not
35  illustrated) progress feedback and exercise recognition may be combined by lighting
    the appropriate number of LEDs to give progress feedback during the exercise

    example, while checking for pushing of the button in step 214, the processing unit nay
    also check for further rotation of the turn knob 76 in either the Iti        or reverse
    directions     Such rotation if detected, May be reflected in the number of LEDs
     lumnated and may cause a restarting of the tier of step 210               dditionany should
10  the timer of step 210 expire before the push button 100 is pressed the nurnber of LEDs
     lumnated at the time of expiry may be stored in a temporary memory As soon as
    further rotation is sensed, the last saved LED configuration may be retrieved such that
    the same number of LE~s are immediately ilMiAted, returning the user to their last
    input situation. Once input is registered by pressing of te push button 100 the
15  temporary mery may be cleared                in ts   manner should a user take longer that the
    threshold delay to decide whether the istrated pain evel is representative before
    pu[shing, the Push button 100, they may recommnence immediately simply by making a
    adiditjinal, ro--tatiojnal motion of the kno,-b 76.
20  A remrinder function mpay also be incorporated into the process flown~ of Fig,-ure 9. For
    example, at speed times of day the feedback LEDs may be programmed to glow if
    no exercises have yet been sensed by the apparatus 2 during theo day. During display,
    of the reminder, pressing the push button 100 may have the effect of "snoozing" or
    cance        the reader. n
    Another vacation to the process Low and functionality which may be considered
    includes the additon of a further LED within the push button 100. According to one
          exmlthis push button LED may be cau-sed to,-glow, as soon as roation of the kinob
    76 is registered, so prompting the user to push the push button 100 and so register the
30  pain input informnation.

     importance, such that illuminating LEDs to reflect rotation of the turn knob 76 (pain
     input) will always be given priority over illuminating the LEDs for any other reason, for
     example to provide progress feedback. Alternative priorities for LED illumination may
 5   be envisaged for particular use cases.
     Figures 10a to 1Of illustrate feedback states of the array of LEDs forming the feedback
     unit 14. In the illustrated arrangement, the array comprises 10 bi-colour (green/blue)
     feedback LEDs, 1 red battery LED and 1 red memory LED. The bi-colour LEDs are
10   illuminated green for progress feedback and exercise recognition, and blue to
     represent pain input. The array is illustrated as a single linear array for ease of
     representation. However it will be appreciated that in the examples of Figures 1 to 7
    the bi-colour LEDs are arranged in a circular array, with LED1 adjacent to LED10, and
    the red battery and memory LEDs are mounted on a side of the apparatus 2           Each of
15   Figures 10a to 10f illustrates illumination of the various LEDs against time for different
    feedback situations.
     Figure 10a represents progress feedback, prompted by pressing of the push button
     100 without turning of the turn knob 76. In the illustrated case, the proportion of the
20   assigned program of exercises that have been completed maps to 6 out of the 10 LEDs
     being illuminated green. LEDI is illuminated first, followed by LED2, LED3, etc until
     LED 7 is caused to flash, signalling that the user has completed 60% of the exercises
     and is currently working towards 70% of the program.
25   Figure lOb illustrates battery and memory feedback. The memory LED is glowing solid
     red indicating that the available memory space is approaching low values and the
     stored data should be cleared at the next opportunity. When the available memory
     reaches a critical level, the memory LED will blink red. The battery LED is blinking red,
     indicating that the battery is low and should be charged. A solid glowing battery LED
30   would indicate that the battery is approaching low status while the blinking LED
     indicates the battery has reached low levels and should be charged.
     Figure ICc illustrates pain input from a user. The user has turned the turn knob 76 by
     an amount corresponding to 5 of the 10 LEDs being illuminated (blue). The user then
35   pushes the push button 100 to register the pain input, at which point the LEDs
     sequentially turned off, starting with LED1 until only the last illuminated LED (LEDS)

    remains. This last LED begins to blin, indicating sucessfulregstato           of the pain
    input before also being tuned off.
    Figure 1d ilustrtes exercise recognition      On recognising completion of a stored
 5  exercise, the processor causes Al of the bi-colour LEDs to blink (green) together,
     indiating that the current exercie has been rcgie.As            discussed above, the
    feedback situations of Figure I Oa (progress feedback) and IlOd (exercse recognion)
     may be combined by causing only the number of LEDs corresponding to the proportin
       f the assined program Whch has been completed to blink on ecognising completion
10   of the stored exercise. Thus the example of Figures a and 10d the ft                LEDs
     would blink on recognion of the exercise. Once enough additional exerase repetitions
     have been completed to represent completion of 7% of the assigned progran,             out of
     the 10 LEDs woud inFk to single exercise          nt      and so on.
15   Figure 1 e iustrates the reminder function, with all bi-colour LEDs blinking alternately
     blue and green while no movenment is taking plac reminding the user to perform their
     exercises.

     The apparatus 2 tUsn represents a selfcontained mnonitoring unit with wic1-h a user
      may ineract both to receive feedanck and to provide input The continuous input
25    devce enables the capture of relatively detailed information concerning user pain in a
      manner that is easy to master for users of all ages and ablities. The combinati of
      discrete and contuous user input depces furher facilittes the capture and display of
      information useful both to a user and to a mdclpractitioner- such as a
      physiotherapist.
