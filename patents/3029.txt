This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2014211628, filed on 24 January
2014, and is related to International Patent Application No. PCT/EP2014/051455, filed on 24 January
2014, and claims priority from United Kingdom Provisional Patent Application No. GB1301626.6, filed on
30 January 2013, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
The invention pertains to the compositions, formulations and methods of treating fatty liver disorders
(FLD), such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and
their sequelae by administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising 15-hydroxy
eicosapentaenoic acid (known as 15-OHEPA or 15-HEPE) in a subject in need thereof. In particular, the
invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition with improved efficacy over one comprising EPA as
the significant active component, rather than 15-OHEPA, for the treatment of subjects suffering from
FLD and/or complications of FLD, to reduce fatty deposits in the liver to treat or prevent FLD and its
associated complications.
                                        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Fatty liver disorders, also known as fatty liver or fatty liver disease (FLD), relates to a condition where
large vacuoles of triglyceride fat accumulate in liver cells via the process of steatosis, or abnormal
retention of lipids within a cell. Despite having multiple causes, fatty liver is considered a single disease
that occurs frequently in subjects with excessive alcohol intake and/or those who are obese (with or
without effects of insulin resistance). The condition is also associated with other diseases that influence
fat metabolism. FLD may be categorized into two separate conditions: alcoholic FLD and non-alcoholic
FLD. Both conditions show micro-vesicular and macro-vesicular fatty changes at different stages of the
disease. Accumulation of fat may also be accompanied by a progressive inflammation of the liver
(hepatitis), called steatohepatitis. Fatty liver is also known in the art as alcoholic steatosis and non
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and the more severe forms as alcoholic steatohepatitis (part of
alcoholic liver disease) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
associated cirrhosis is the most severe form of the disease and is characterized by liver inflammation
that leads to scarring of the liver tissue, ultimately resulting in liver failure.
Obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis are increasing at an alarming rate in
the Western world. In recent years, fatty liver has emerged as an independent risk factor for these
diseases. Fatty liver is the accumulation of triglycerides and other fats within hepatocytes. Fatty liver
disease can range from fatty liver alone (also known as "steatosis"), to fatty liver associated with
inflammation or steatohepatitis. Non-alcoholic fatty
                                                          1

liver disease (NAFLD) and non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are the most common causes
of chronic liver disease in the adult population and represents a crucial risk factor for
progression to liver failure, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. While steatosis affects
approximately 30% of the population, 80% of obese patients have NAFLD and 50% of patients
undergoing bariatric surgery have steatohepatitis. NAFLD also represents the most common
cause of liver disease in children. It is estimated that NAFLD affects up to 20 percent of adults
and nearly 5 percent of children. Some experts estimate that about two thirds of obese adults
and half of obese children may have fatty liver. In the past ten years, as the rates of obesity in
have doubled in adults and tripled in children and teenagers, NAFLD and NASH are becoming
more common. NASH can cause scarring and hardening of the liver, leading to cirrhosis, a very
serious disease that may require a liver transplant, and eventually to hepatocellular carcinoma.
There is no single established medical treatment for fatty liver. Presently, treatment of NAFLD is
limited to 1) treatment of associated metabolic disorders such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia;
2) the management of insulin resistance focusing on weight loss, exercise and/or a
pharmacological approach; and 3) the use of antioxidants as hepatic protection agents. Despite
the use of many different therapeutic modalities, no clear treatment is currently available to
address NAFLD. Because it is clinically important to resolve NAFLD and its sequelae, new
approaches aimed at preventing and reversing fat accumulation in the liver are necessary.
We have surprisingly found that 15 OHEPA, a metabolite of EPA, is more potent than EPA in
the treatment of FLD.
                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
The present invention relates to compositions and methods for treating fatty liver disorders,
including non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), by
administration of a composition comprising 15 OHEPA in a subject in need thereof.
As used herein, "15 OHEPA" is 15 Hydroxy eicosa 5,8,11,13,17 pentaenoic acid. 15 OHEPA
can be synthesized from eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA according to methods known in the art.
As used herein, the term "15 OHEPA" refers to 15 OHEPA in its free acid form (e.g, 15 hydroxy
eicosa 5,8,11,13,17 pentaenoic acid) and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable ester, conjugate or
salt thereof, or mixtures of any of the foregoing. A derviative of 15 OHEPA may be used
                                                  2

instead, though this does not include any derivative compound missing the hydroxy group of 15
OHEPA. In some embodiments, the 15-OHEPA is used in the free acid form. Alternatively,
pharmaceutically acceptable esters or salts of 15-OHEPA are used in the invention. In some
embodiments, the 15-OHEPA is in the form of a C-4 alkyl ester such as methyl ester or ethyl
ester form.
As used herein, "EPA" is eicosa-5,8,11,14,17-pentaenoic acid, also known as 20:5n-3, an
omega-3 fatty acid. EPA is readily obtainable through commercial sources.
Accordingly, in one aspect of the present invention, a method of treating a fatty liver disorder in
a subject is provided, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount
of a composition comprising 15-OHEPA.
The present invention provides 15-OHEPA, or a composition comprising 15-OHEPA, for use in
the treatment of a fatty liver disorder.
The present invention provides a use of 15-OHEPA, or a composition comprising 15-OHEPA, in
the manufacture of a medicament for treating a fatty liver disorder.
In another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a
therapeutically effective amount of 15-OHEPA. The 15-OHEPA may be the sole significant
active ingredient in that composition and in the methods and uses as stated herein. The 15
OHEPA may be the sole active ingredient. Alternatively, the 15-OHEPA may be combined for
co-formulation or co-administration with other agents for treating FLD. If an additional active
agent is to be used, the 15-OHEPA can be co-formulated as a single dosage unit or can be
formulated as two to a plurality of dosage units for coordinated, combination or concomitant
administration.
The invention also provides formulations of 15-OHEPA and formulations comprising 15-OHEPA
and methods of using these formulations for treating fatty liver disorders, including non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
15-OHEPA is a chiral molecule and may be used in the (S)- or (R)- enantiomeric form, or as a
racemic mixture. Used herein, "15-OHEPA" includes all such forms, with no limitation as to
                                                3

stereospecifcity. In another embodiment, the 15-OHEPA comprises the (S) form: 15(S)
Hydroxy-(5Z,8Z,11Z,13E,17Z)-eicosapentaenoic acid. In some embodiments, the 15-OHEPA
may be used in the form of the ethyl ester. In other embodiments the 15-OHEPA may be used
as the free acid.
The present invention further provides an pharmaceutical composition for oral delivery,
comprising 15-OHEPA. That composition may comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable
excipient. The 15-OHEPA may be in any form as discussed herein. The 15-OHEPA may be
present from about 50 mg to about 3000 mg.
Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning
as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains.
Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in
the practice of the present invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All
publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are expressly
incorporated by reference in their entirety. In cases of conflict, the present specification,

OHEPA compositions can comprise even higher purity 15-OHEPA, for example at least 95% by
weight 15-OHEPA or at least 97% by weight 15-OHEPA, wherein the 15-OHEPA is any form of
15-OHEPA as set forth herein. The purity of 15-OHEPA can further be defined (e.g. impurity
profile) by any of the descriptions of 15-OHEPA provided herein.
Above are discussed the amounts of the 15-OHEPA in the pharmaceutical composition and
their purity. The nature of the essential fatty acids and their synthesis is such that the 15
OHEPA composition may include moieties from other essential fatty acids in the essential fatty
acid metabolic cascade.
In one embodiment, a composition of the invention contains not more than about 10%, not more
than about 9%, not more than about 8%, not more than about 7%, not more than about 6%, not
more than about 5%, not more than about 4%, not more than about 3%, not more than about

in a form which has not been modified to the hydroxyl-form.
Additional active agents
In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises one or more additional
active agent(s). In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises an amount of
                                                  7

the additional active agent that is less than the generally recognized therapeutically effective
amount for that agent. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises an
amount of the additional active agent that is equal to or greater than the generally recognized
therapeutically effective amount for that agent.
EPA itself has beneficial properties in treating FLD and it is possible to combine the 15-OHEPA
with EPA in an alternative embodiment.
In one embodiment, 15-OHEPA and one or more active agent(s) are present in a composition of
the invention, or are co-administered in a weight ratio of 15-OHEPA: additional agent of about

about 50:1, about 1:25 to about 25:1, about 1:10 to about 10:1, about 1:5 to about 5:1, about 1:4
to about 4:1 about 1:3 to about 3:1, about 1:2 to about 2:1 or about 1:1.
Dosage Forms
A composition for use in accordance with the disclosure can be formulated as one or more
dosage units. The terms "dose unit" and "dosage unit" herein refer to a portion of a
pharmaceutical composition that contains an amount of a therapeutic agent suitable for a single
administration to provide a therapeutic effect. Such dosage units may be administered one to a
plurality (i.e. 1 to about 10, 1 to 8, 1 to 6, 1 to 4 or 1 to 2) of times per day, or as many times as
needed to elicit a therapeutic response.
In some embodiments, compositions of the invention are in the form of orally deliverable dosage
forms or units. Non-limiting examples of suitable dosage forms include tablets (e.g. suspension
tablets, bite suspension tablets, rapid dispersion tablets, chewable tablets, etc), caplets,
capsules (e.g. a soft or a hard gelatin capsule or HPMC capsule), lozenges, sachets, cachets,
troches, pellets, suspension, elixirs, syrups or any other solid dosage form reasonably adapted
for oral administration. The terms "oral delivery" and "oral administration" herein include any
form of delivery wherein the agent or composition is placed in the mouth of the subject under
treatment, whether swallowed or not. This therefore includes buccal and sublingual
administration, as well as esophagael administration.
Alternatively, compositions of the invention can also be formulated for rectal, topical, or
parenteral (e.g. subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal or infusion) delivery.
                                                     8

In discussing the amount of 15-OHEPA in a composition of the invention, this may be split over
several dosage forms. There is a limit as to the size for oral administration. If a subject is to be
administered 1 to 4 g 15-OHEPA a day, this may be by up to 4 capsules, each providing 1g 15
OHEPA.
Compositions of the invention can be in the form of liquid dosage forms or dose units to be
imbibed directly or they can be mixed with food or beverage prior to ingestion. Non-limiting
examples of suitable liquid dosage forms include solutions, suspensions, elixirs, syrups, liquid
aerosol formulations, and the like.
In another embodiment, compositions of the invention comprise one or more pharmaceutically
acceptable excipients. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" herein means any
substance, not itself a therapeutic agent, used as a carrier or vehicle for delivery of a
therapeutic agent to a subject or added to a pharmaceutical composition to improve its handling
or storage properties or to permit or facilitate formation of a unit dose of the composition, and
that does not produce unacceptable toxicity or interaction with other components in the
composition.   By way of example only, a pharmaceutical composition according to the present
disclosure may comprise one or more of: antioxidants, surfactants, preservatives, flavouring
agents, co-solvents, viscosity aids, suspension aids, and lipophilic phases.
In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises one or more antioxidants such
as ascorbic acid, palmitic acid, ascorbyl palmitate, a-tocopherol, idebenone, ubiquinone, ferulic
acid, coenzyme Q10, lycopene, green tea, catechins, epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), green
tea polyphenols (GTP), silymarin, coffeeberry, resveratrol, grape seed, pomegranate extracts,

Therapeutic Methods
The compositions and formulations disclosed herein may be used in the treatment of fatty liver
disease. In one embodiment the fatty liver disease is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In
another embodiment the fatty liver disease is non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In one embodiment,
the method comprises administering a pharmaceutical composition as disclosed herein to a
subject once per day, twice per day, three times per day, or more than three times per day.
As used herein, "treating" or "treatment" of a disease, disorder, or condition includes at least
partially: (1) preventing the disease, disorder, or condition, i.e. causing the clinical symptoms of
the disease, disorder, or condition not to develop in a mammal that is exposed to or
predisposed to the disease, disorder, or condition but does not yet experience or display
symptoms of the disease, disorder, or condition; (2) inhibiting the disease, disorder, or condition,
i.e., arresting or reducing the development of the disease, disorder, or condition or its clinical
symptoms; or (3) relieving the disease, disorder, or condition, i.e., causing regression of the
disease, disorder, or condition or its clinical symptoms. The term "prevention" in relation to a
given disease or disorder means: preventing the onset of disease development if none had
occurred, preventing the disease or disorder from occurring in a subject that may be
                                                  10

predisposed to the disorder or disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having the disorder or
disease, and/or preventing further disease/disorder development if already present.
An "effective amount," as used herein, refers to the amount of an active composition that is
required to confer a therapeutic effect on the subject. A "therapeutically effective amount," as
used herein, refers to a sufficient amount of an agent or a compound being administered which
will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disease, disorder, or condition
being treated. In some embodiments, the result is a reduction and/or alleviation of the signs,
symptoms, or causes of a disease, or any other desired alteration of a biological system. For
example, in some embodiments, an "effective amount" for therapeutic uses is the amount of the
composition including a compound as disclosed herein required to provide a clinically significant
decrease in disease symptoms without undue adverse side effects. In some embodiments, an
appropriate "effective amount" in any individual case is determined using techniques, such as a
dose escalation study. The term "therapeutically effective amount" includes, for example, a
prophylactically effective amount. In other embodiments, an "effective amount" of a compound
disclosed herein, such as a compound of Formula (A) or Formula (1),is an amount effective to
achieve a desired pharmacologic effect or therapeutic improvement without undue adverse side
effects. In other embodiments, it is understood that "an effect amount" or "a therapeutically
effective amount" varies from subject to subject, due to variation in metabolism, age, weight,
general condition of the subject, the condition being treated, the severity of the condition being
treated, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable"
in the present context means that the substance in question does not produce unacceptable
toxicity to the subject or interaction with other components of the composition.
Without further description, it is believed that one of ordinary skill in the art may, using the
preceding description and the following illustrative examples, make and utilize the agents of the
present disclosure and practice the claimed methods. The following working examples are
provided to facilitate the practice of the present disclosure, and are not to be construed as
limiting in any way the remainder of the disclosure.
                                              EXAMPLES
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of 15-OHEPA and EPA in the STAM
model of Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis.
                                                   11

Protocol
Pathogen-freel 5-day-pregnant C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories in
Japan Inc. (Kanagawa, Japan). NASH was established in male mice by a single subcutaneous
injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (Sigma, USA) after birth and feeding with a high fat diet (HFD;
CLEA) Japan, Japan) ad libitum after 4 weeks of age (day 28±2). Mice were randomized into 5
groups of 8 mice at 5 weeks of age (day 35±2) the day before the start of treatment.
During the treatment period, individual body weight was measured daily as well as clinical signs
of behavior and survival.
Groups:
Group 1 (Vehicle): Eight NASH mice were orally administered vehicle [olive oil] in a volume of
10 mL/kg once daily from 5 to 9 weeks of age.
Group 2 (15-OHEPA 50 mg/kg): Eight NASH mice were orally administered vehicle
supplemented with 15-OHEPA at a dose of 50 mg/kg once daily from 5 to 9 weeks of age.
Group 3 (15-OHEPA 500 mg/kg): Eight NASH mice were orally administered vehicle
supplemented with 15-OHEPA at a dose of 500 mg/kg once daily from 5 to 9 weeks of age.
Group 4 (EPA 500 mg/kg): Eight NASH mice were orally administered vehicle supplemented
with EPA at a dose 500 mg/kg once daily from 5 to 9 weeks of age.
Group 5 (positive control): Eight NASH mice were orally administered pure water supplemented
with Telmisartan at a dose of 10 mg/kg once daily from 5 to 9 weeks of age.
At 9 weeks of age, all mice were sacrificed and the following data was recorded;
    *   Individual liver weight
    *   Liver to body weight ratio
                                               12

Histopathological analyses of liver sections were performed using HE staining (to estimate NAFLD
Activity score). For HE staining, sections were cut from paraffin blocks of liver tissue prefixed in
Bouin's solution and stained with Lillie-Mayer's Hematoxylin (Muto Pure Chemicals, Japan) and
eosin solution (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). NAFLD Activity score (NAS) was calculated
according to the criteria of Kleiner (Kleiner DE. et aL, Hepatology, 2005:41:1313).
Statistical tests were performed using Bonferroni Multiple Comparison Test. P values <0,05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
Figure 1.1 shows that there was no significant change in body weight in any of the experimental
groups.
Figure 1.2 shows that only the 15-OHEPA treatment group (500mg/kg) and the positive control
(telmisartan) had a significant reduction in liver weight as compared to the vehicle control,
Figures 2.1 and 2.2 show that NAS significantly decreased only in the 15-OHEPA (500 mg/kg)
and the positive control (telmisartan) groups as compared to the vehicle control,
