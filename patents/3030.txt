  FIND IT
 How many times do you find yourself in a situation where you are shopping for something
 and look for an assistant to help you locate an item?
 FIND IT is an application for smart phones and other similar devices.
 FIND IT can also be implemented / integrated to be placed in designated areas within a shop
 / shopping centre / outlet / warehouse etc for visitors to access and use.
 FIND IT allows you to search for any item in any place via your phone/device.
 The way FIND IT can be used is noted in Fig 1 on the Drawings Page.
 Once you have the place selected on your App, you can then search an item/facility. This can
 include but not be limited to the following:
*   Toilet Paper
* Hammer
" Drill bits
* Public Toilets
* Change rooms
* Exit
* Layby Section
* Changerooms
* Cashier
* Customer Service
* Stationary
* Soft Drinks
* Menswear
* Ladies shoes
* Makeup
* ATM machine (with specific bank option)
* Food Court (with specific retailer)
* Specific retailer (Subway, McDonalds etc)
 FIND IT will then give you an isle number/location or direct you which way to walk to reach
 the selected item/service/location.
 For retailers/owners, the amount of time their staff spend giving directions to customers
 and visitors will be greatly reduced when they come on-board to be part of the FIND IT app.
 The data required will be placed against each store with an option to edit/add/remove as
 required.

For example, if Woolworths at Dural NSW wishes to participate, they will be sent something
similar to this:
         Category                  Item                     Isle
  Confectionary           Cadbury Top Deck         7
  Soft Drinks             Fanta                    3
  Fruit and Veg           Bananas                  1
The more information provided, the better the filter will be to locate the item for the user.
Larger retailers will complete a more detailed form, or places like Westfields; may replicate
their shopping centre directory into this App to give users the information on their phones.
In Australia, the types of companies that would benefit from their customers having this
App on their phone and being able to quickly locate their items would include but not be
limited to:
    *    Westfields
    *    Stockland Malls
    *    Woolworths
    *    Coles
    *    Myer
    "    David Jones
    *    Aldi
    *    Foodworks
    * IGA
     " Target
    * Kmart
    * BIG W
    * Harvey Norman
    * Costco
    * Bunnings
    * Home Hardware
    e    Ikea
Revenue from the app would be from the following:
    *    Retailers paying an annual fee to have their item locations listed
    *    Advertising on the app
    *    Retailers paying a fee to have specials / discounts etc appear on the App for users
         who have just logged in to the App within a specific store.
FIND IT can also be downloaded to a device located in strategic positions within a
store/outlet/centre for customers to use.
