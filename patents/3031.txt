   Summary of the  Invention
   In accordance with a first aspect of the present
   invention, there is provided a gaming system comprising:
25      a symbol allocator arranged to allocate a plurality
   of player symbols to a player, wherein a number of the
   player symbols allocated to the player is based on a
   number of credits used to purchase the player symbols;
        a symbol selector arranged to make a selection of at
30 least one of the player symbols at each level of a
   multilevel game;
        an outcome generator arranged to determine at each
   level of the multilevel game a successful or unsuccessful
   game level outcome based on a comparison of the selection
35 of the at least one player symbols with at least one
   reference symbol such that the player proceeds to a
   succeeding game level if the game outcome is successful
   and the player does not proceed to a succeeding game level
   if the game outcome is not successful; and
                                                     10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

                               - 2
         a prize allocator arranged to allocate a prize to a
   player based on the game level the player has successfully
   completed and not on the at least one player symbol
   selected by the symbol selector.
 5
   In one arrangement, the at least one reference symbol is
   attributed to the gaming system.   With this arrangement,
   the symbol selector may be arranged to select at least one
   reference symbol at each level of the multilevel game from
10 the set of symbols.
   In an alternative arrangement, the at least one reference
   symbol is attributed to a player.   With this arrangement,
   the at least one reference symbol may be at least one
15 symbol selected by the symbol selector and attributed to
   the player in a previous level of the multilevel game.
   In one embodiment, the multilevel game is a multiplayer
   game.   With this arrangement, the comparator may be
20 arranged to compare the respective selected player symbols
   with each other or with at least one reference symbol
   attributed to the gaming system.
   In one embodiment, the gaming system is arranged such that
25 the probability of proceeding to a successive level tends
   to reduce with each successive level of the game.
   In one embodiment, the comparator is arranged to compare
   one reference symbol with the or each selected player
30 symbol, the outcome generator allows the player to proceed
   to a succeeding game level if the outcome generator
   determines that the game outcome associated with at least
   one player symbol is successful, and the symbol selector
   is arranged to select a number of player symbols at the
35 succeeding game level which corresponds to the number of
   player symbols associated with successful game outcomes.
                                                     10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

                               -  3
   In one arrangement, the comparator is arranged to compare
   a highest or lowest ranked reference symbol with the or
   each selected player symbol.     The reference symbols and
 5 the player symbols may comprise numbers, pictures or
   shapes and the comparator may be arranged to compare a
   highest or lowest ranked reference number, picture or
   shape with the or each selected player number, picture or
   shape.
10
   In one arrangement, the reference symbols and the player
   symbols comprise numbers and the outcome generator
   determines a successful outcome if any one of the selected
   player symbols is ranked greater than, or greater than or
15 equal to the highest or lowest ranked symbol of the
   selected reference symbols.    In an alternative
   arrangement, the outcome generator determines a successful
   outcome if any one of the selected player symbols is
   ranked less than, or less than or equal to the highest or
20 lowest ranked symbol of the selected reference symbol.
   In one arrangement, the comparator is arranged to compare
   a selected reference symbol combination with a selected
   player symbol combination.    The reference symbols and the
25 player symbols may comprise numbers and the comparator may
   be arranged to compare a sum of the selected reference
   numbers with a sum of the selected player numbers.
   In one arrangement, the outcome generator determines a
30 successful outcome if the sum of the selected player
   numbers is greater than or equal to the sum of the
   selected reference numbers.    In an alternative
   arrangement, the outcome generator determines a successful
   outcome if the sum of the selected player numbers is less
35 than, or less than or equal to the sum of the selected
   reference numbers.
                                                       10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

   The gaming system may be arranged to apply a linear
   ranking to the symbols, or may be arranged to apply a
   circular ranking to the symbols, such as in the game
   "scissors, paper, rock".

   In one embodiment, the symbols comprise representations of
   dice, cards, dominos, tiles or shapes.
   The symbols may comprise at least one function symbol.
10 The function associated with a function symbol may be a
   wild function.
   The set of symbols may be fixed for all levels of the
   multilevel game or the set of symbols from which the
15 player symbols and the reference symbols are selected may
   be dependent on the game level.
   In one arrangement, the number of selected reference
   symbols is fixed for all levels of the multilevel game.
20 In an alternative arrangement, the number of selected
   reference symbols increases or decreases with each
   succeeding level of the multilevel game.
   In one embodiment, the prize allocator is arranged to
25 additionally allocate a prize to a player based on
   occurrence of a predetermined combination of player
   symbols at a level of the multilevel game, or based on
   occurrence of a predetermined sequence of symbol
   combinations in consecutive levels of the multilevel game.
30
   The gaming system may be arranged such that a player is
   able to choose to continue in the multilevel game and
   thereby risk losing a prize or a portion of a prize
   associated with a level successfully reached, or to end
35 the game and receive a prize applicable to the level of
   the game reached by the player.
                                                    10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

   with an embodiment of the present invention when
   implementing the method of gaming illustrated in Figure 8.
   Description of an Embodiment of the Invention
 5
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   arranged to implement a multilevel probabilistic wagering
   game wherein a player wagers a bet amount and a prize is
   allocated to the player depending on the game level
10 reached by the player.  For example, the prize amount may
   increase with each succeeding level from an initial amount
   applicable for reaching a first level.  The initial amount
   may be zero.
15 The multilevel game implemented by the gaming system
   operates such that for each level of the game a reference
   symbol or combination of reference symbols is compared
   with a player symbol or combination of player symbols in
   accordance with predefined rules in order to determine
20 whether the player is successful or unsuccessful.      Success
   as defined by the rules enables the player to pass to the
   next level.  Failure causes the multilevel game to cease
   and for a prize associated with the level successfully
   reached by the player to be allocated to the player.
25
   The symbols may take any suitable form such as
   representations of dice, cards, dominoes, tiles, shapes or
   any other type of symbols which have an associated ranking
   or to which a ranking can be applied so that a comparison
30 of the reference symbol(s) with the player symbol(s)
   yields a success or failure result.  The ranking may be
   fixed or may vary according to a schedule, such as in the
   game "scissors, paper, rock".
35 In one example, the symbols are representations of dice
   numbers and success is determined on the basis of whether
   any of the players dice show a number greater than or
                                                     10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

                              - 9
   equal to the highest number shown on the reference dice.
   In an alternative example, the symbols are representations
   of dice numbers and success is determined on the basis of
 5 whether the sum of the numbers shown on the players dice
   is greater than or equal to the sum of the numbers shown
   on the reference dice.
   The dice may be of the type including numbers, letters,
10 one or more colours, or at least one special symbol or
   colour having an allocated special function or prize.
   The number of player and/or reference dice may be constant
   or may vary according to game rules, for example may
15 increase or decrease with each succeeding game level, and
   the dice used may comprise the same symbols or may have
   different combinations of symbols.  Each level of the
   multilevel game may use the same dice or may use different
   dice depending on the level.
20
   The reference symbol or combination of symbols may be
   attributed to the gaming system, for example in an
   embodiment wherein the symbols are representations of dice
   numbers, by referring to the reference symbol(s) as a
25 "dealer throw", or may be the previous symbol or
   combination of symbols attributed to the player and
   referred to as a previous "player throw".
   The symbols may include standard symbols and may
30 additionally include one or more function symbols, and the
   ranking associated with a symbol or combination of symbols
   may be determined on the basis of the displayed standard
   symbols and the function associated with any displayed
   function symbol.  The function associated with a function
35 symbol may be for example a wild function wherein display
   of the function symbol is treated during consideration of
   the game outcome as any of the standard symbols or as a
                                                    10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

                              - 10
   predetermined function selected by the gaming system on
   commencement of the multilevel game.
   Referring to Figure 1, a gaming system 10 for implementing
 5 a multilevel game is shown in diagrammatic form.    The
   gaming system 10 comprises a memory 12 arranged to store
   symbols data 14 indicative of a plurality of symbols for
   selection and display to a player during a game, function
   data 16 indicative of one or more functions associated
10 with one or more of the symbols, prize data 18 indicative
   of prize amounts associated with win outcomes for reaching
   each level of the game, and game instruction data 20
   indicative of game instructions usable by the gaming
   machine 10 to control operation of the multilevel game.
15
   The gaming system 10 also includes a symbol selector 22
   which is arranged to select one or more symbols for
   display to a player as one or more reference symbols, and
   to select one or more symbols for display to the player as
20 one or more player symbols, in this example using a random
   number generator 24.
   It will be appreciated that the random number generator 24
   may be of a type which is arranged to generate pseudo
25 random numbers based on a seed number, and that in this
   specification the term "random" will be understood
   accordingly to mean truly random or pseudo random.
   The gaming system 10 also comprises a comparator 30
30 arranged to compare the reference symbol(s) with the
   player symbol(s) in accordance with the game instruction
   data 20, and an outcome generator 32 which in accordance
   with the game instruction data 20 determines whether the
   player is successful and therefore able to pass to the
35 next level of the multilevel game or unsuccessful and
   therefore not able to pass to the next level of the game.
                                                    10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

                              - 11
   While in this example the comparator and the outcome
   generator are shown as separate components, it will be
   understood that the functions of the outcome generator and
   the comparator may be implemented by one component.
 5
   The gaming system 10 also comprises a prize allocator 34
   which communicates with the prize data 18 stored in the
   memory 12 and with the outcome generator 30, and
   determines an appropriate prize to allocate to a player
10 depending on which level of the game the player has
   reached.
   Additional prizes may be allocated on the basis of
   occurrence of a predetermined combination, such as for
15 example the same symbol on all dice, a consecutive
   sequence such as 1,2,3, occurrence of all odd or all even
   numbers, occurrence of the same symbol combination, a
   predetermined sequence in consecutive throws, and so on.
   The additional prizes may take the form of one or more
20 additional throws.
   The gaming system 10 may also be arranged such that a
   player has the option of choosing to continue in the
   multilevel game and thereby attempt to reach a succeeding
25 level, or to end the game and receive the prize amount
   applicable for the current level reached by the player.
   Instead of providing monetary prize amounts, the prize
   allocated to a player for reaching a level and/or any
30 additional prize may be in the form of points, tokens,
   progressive prizes, eligibility for feature games,
   tournament entitlements, or special symbol entitlements in
   other games, such as an additional wild symbol for a
   predetermined number of games.
35
   The multilevel game may be implemented as part of another
   game wherein the multilevel game is activated as a result
                                                    10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

                              - 12
   of any predetermined action, such as a game outcome
   related event, an operator initiated event, a random
   event, an event related to turnover, or an event related
   to special bets being placed.
 5
   In the embodiment described below, the symbol selector 22,
   the comparator 30, the prize allocator 34 and the outcome
   generator 30 are implemented using a microprocessor and
   associated programs, although it will be understood that
10 other implementations are envisaged.
   The gaming system 10 can take a number of different forms.
   In a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
15 wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
20 the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
25 gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
30 and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
35 wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the

   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
 5 skilled in the art.
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 40 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   40 includes a console 42 having a display 44 on which is
10 displayed representations of a game 46 that can be played
   by a player.  A mid-trim 50 of the gaming machine 40
   houses a bank of buttons 52 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine during gameplay,
   including enabling the player to select the bet amount and
15 the number of lines.  The mid-trim 50 also houses a credit
   input mechanism 54 which in this example includes a coin
   input chute 54A and a bill collector 54B.    Other credit
   input mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
20 card.  A reading device may also be provided for the
   purpose of reading a player tracking device, for example
   as part of a loyalty program.    The player tracking device
   may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any other
   portable storage medium capable of being read by the
25 reading device.
   A top box 56 may carry artwork 58,   including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.    Further
30 artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 59 of the console 42.    A coin tray 60 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 59 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 30.
35 The display 44 is in the form of a video display unit,
   particularly a cathode ray tube screen device.
   Alternatively, the display 44 may be a liquid crystal
                                                      10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

   display, plasma screen, any other suitable video display
   unit.  The top box 56 may also include a display, for
   example a video display unit, which may be of the same
   type as the display 44, or of a different type.
 5
   The display 44 in this example is arranged to display
   representations of several reels, each reel of which has
   several associated symbols.   Typically 3, 4 or 5 reels are
   provided.

   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine 100 which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine shown in Figure 2.
15 The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102.  Instructions and data to control
   operation of the processor 102 in accordance with the
   present invention are stored in a memory 103 which is in
   data communication with the processor 102.
20
   Typically, the gaming machine 100 will include both
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
   type of memory, with such memories being collectively
   represented by the memory 103.
25
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.     The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
30 execution by the processor 102 and related data.     The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.   The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
35 the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere, and data indicative of symbols, prize
   amounts and symbol functions used in the game.
                                                     10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

                              -  15
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output   (I/0) interface 105    for
 5 communicating with a player interface 120 of the gaming
   machine 100, the player interface 120 having several
   peripheral devices.  The input/output interface 105 and/or
   the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with
   their own memory for storing associated instructions and
10 data for use with the input/output interface or the
   peripheral devices.  A random number generator module 113
   generates random numbers for use by the processor 102.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, the peripheral devices
15 that communicate with the game controller 101 comprise one
   or more displays 106, a touch screen and/or bank of
   buttons 107, a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.   Additional hardware may be
20 included as part of the gaming machine 100,   or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
25 communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a central controller, server or database and receive
   data or commands from the central controller, server or
30 database.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 may be
35 provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
                                                      10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network,
   a LAN or a WAN.  In this example, three banks 203 of two
   gaming machines 202 are connected to the network 201.           The
 5 gaming machines 202 provide a player operable interface
   and may be the same as the gaming machines 10,100 shown in
   Figures 2 and 3, or may have simplified functionality
   depending on the requirements for implementing game play.
   While banks 203 of two gaming machines are illustrated in
10 Figure 5, banks of one, three or more gaming machines are
   also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  The displays 204 may, for example, be
15 associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
20
   In a thick client embodiment, a game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server 205
25 and the gaming machine 202 implement part of the game,
   they collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
30 gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to monitor and
   carry out the Jackpot game.
   In a thin client embodiment, the game server 205
35 implements most or all of the game played by a player
   using a gaming machine 202 and the gaming machine 202
   essentially provides only the player interface.  With this
                                                    10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

                              - 17
   embodiment, the game server 205 provides the game
   controller. The gaming machine will receive player
   instructions, and pass the instructions to the game server
   which will process them and return game play outcomes to
 5 the gaming machine for display.   In a thin client
   embodiment, the gaming machines could be computer
   terminals, e.g. PCs running software that provides a
   player interface operable using standard computer input
   and output components.
10
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming system 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208 and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
15 relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to monitor the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
20 systems, other local networks such as a corporate network,
   and/or a wide area network such as the Internet, for
   example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
25 accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
30 server 205 could run a random number generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.
   During operation, the game controller, whether implemented
35 in a stand alone gaming machine 10,  100 or over a network
   201, implements a probabilistic multilevel wagering game
   wherein a prize is allocated to a player based on the game
                                                      10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

                               - 18
   level reached by the player, and a player moves to a
   succeeding level of the game based on a comparison between
   one or more reference symbols and one or more player
   symbols.
 5
   An example of a specific implementation of the gaming
   system will now be described in relation to a stand alone
   gaming machine 40,  100, although it will be understood
   that implementation may also be carried out using other
10 gaming system architectures   such as a network architecture
   of the type shown in Figure 5.
   In the present embodiment, the gaming system 10 is
   arranged to display virtual symbols using a video
15 graphical display device, although it will be understood
   that other arrangements are envisaged, such as reels with
   the symbols disposed thereon.    The symbols in this example
   are in the form of representations of dice numbers.
20 Referring to Figure 6, there is shown a flow diagram 220
   which illustrates  steps 222 to 234 of a method of gaming
   implemented by the gaming system 10.
   In this example, the player can obtain up to 10 dice for
25 use during the game by purchasing dice at a cost of 1
   credit per die, either before or during a game.    The
   player can also bet up to 5 credits on the outcome of the
   game, either before the game or during the game, with an
   increase in the bet placed having the effect of
30 multiplying the possible prize amount allocatable for each
   level of the game.
   With this example, the gaming system 10 implements a game
   wherein a player advances to a succeeding level of the
35 game if the number shown on at least one of the players
   dice is greater than or equal to the highest number shown
                                                      10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

   on the reference dice.    The reference dice are hereinafter
   referred to in this example as "dealer dice".
   In one particular example, the symbols on each of the dice
 5 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, 3 dice are allocated to the
   dealer and 10 dice are purchased by the player.      The
   player and dealer dice may be represented in different
   colours.
10 The symbol selector 22 first selects 3 numbers for the 3
   respective dealer dice 240,    242 and 244, then selects          10
   numbers for the 10 respective player dice 246, 248,         250,
   252, 254, 256, 258,  260,  262,   264, as shown in Figure 7a.
15 The comparator 30 compares the highest number on the
   dealer dice with the numbers on the player dice and if any
   of the numbers on the player dice are equal to or greater
   than the highest number on the dealer dice, those dice are
   retained and the player proceeds to the next level with
20 the retained dice.   If none of the numbers on the player
   dice are equal to or greater than the highest number on
   the dealer dice, the multilevel game ceases and the
   outcome generator 32, in association with the prize
   allocator 34 and the prize data 18, then allocates an
25 appropriate prize to the player dependent on the amount
   bet and the prize amount associated with the first level.
   In the present example, the highest number on the dealer
   dice is 3 and 6 player dice have a number greater than or
30 equal to 3.   Accordingly, 6 player dice proceed to the
   second level.
   In this example, the number of dealer dice remains the
   same throughout the multilevel game, although it will be
35 understood that other variations are possible.      For
   example, the number of dealer dice may increase or
   decrease with each succeeding level.
                                                        10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

   At the second level, the symbol selector 22 selects 3
   numbers for the 3 respective dealer dice 240, 242 and 244,
   then selects 6 numbers for the 6 remaining player dice
 5 246, 248, 250, 256, 258, 264,   as shown in Figure 7b.
   The comparator 30 compares the highest number on the
   dealer dice with the numbers on the player dice and if any
   of the numbers on the player dice are equal to or greater
10 than the highest number on the dealer dice, those dice are
   retained and the player proceeds to the third level with
   the retained dice.  If none of the numbers on the player
   dice are equal to or greater than the highest number on
   the dealer dice, the multilevel game ceases and the
15 outcome generator 32, in association with the prize
   allocator 34 and the prize data 18, then allocates an
   appropriate prize to the player dependent on the amount
   bet and the prize amount associated with reaching the
   second level.
20
   In the present example, the highest number on the dealer
   dice is 4 and 3 player dice 248, 250 and 258 have a number
   greater than or equal to 4.    Accordingly, 3 player dice
   proceed to the third level.
25
   At the third level, the symbol selector 22 selects 3
   numbers for the 3 respective dealer dice 240, 242 and 244,
   then selects 3 numbers for the 3 remaining player dice
   248, 250 and 258, as shown in Figure 7c.

   The comparator 30 compares the highest number on the
   dealer dice with the numbers on the player dice and if any
   of the numbers on the player dice are equal to or greater
   than the highest number on the dealer dice, those dice are
35 retained and the player proceeds to the fourth level with
   the retained dice.  If none of the numbers on the player
   dice are equal to or greater than the highest number on
                                                      10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

   allocator 34 and the prize data 18, then allocates an
   appropriate prize to the player dependent on the amount
 5 bet and the prize amount associated with reaching the
   third level.
   In the present example, the highest number on the dealer
   dice is 1, and all 3 player dice 248,  250 and 258 have a
10 number greater than or equal to 1.   Accordingly, all 3
   player dice proceed to the fourth level.
   At the fourth level, the symbol selector 22 selects 3
   numbers for the 3 respective dealer dice 240, 242 and 244,
15 then selects 3 numbers for the 3 remaining player dice
   248, 250 and 258, as shown in Figure 7d.
   The comparator 30 compares the highest number on the
   dealer dice with the numbers on the player dice and if any
20 of the numbers on the player dice are equal to or greater
   than the highest number on the dealer dice, those dice are
   retained and the player proceeds to the fifth level with
   the retained dice.  If none of the numbers on the player
   dice are equal to or greater than the highest number on
25 the dealer dice, the multilevel game ceases and the
   outcome generator 32, in association with the prize
   allocator 34 and the prize data 18, then allocates an
   appropriate prize to the player dependent on the amount
   bet and the prize amount associated with reaching the
30 fourth level.
   In the present example, the highest number on the dealer
   dice is 3, and 2 player dice 248 and 258 have a number
   greater than or equal to 3.   Accordingly, 2 player dice
35 proceed to the fifth level.

   then selects 2 numbers for the 2 remaining player dice 248
   and 258, as shown in Figure 7e.

   The comparator 30 compares the highest number on the
   dealer dice with the numbers on the player dice and if any
   of the numbers on the player dice are equal to or greater
   than the highest number on the dealer dice, those dice are
10 retained and the player proceeds to the sixth level with
   the retained dice.   If none of the numbers on the player
   dice are equal to or greater than the highest number on
   the dealer dice, the multilevel game ceases and the
   outcome generator 32, in association with the prize
15 allocator 34 and the prize data 18, then allocates an
   appropriate prize to the player dependent on the amount
   bet and the prize amount associated with reaching the
   fifth level.
20 In the present example, the highest number on the dealer
   dice is 5, and none of the player dice 248 and 258 have a
   number greater than or equal to 5.   Accordingly, none of
   the player dice proceed to the sixth level.

   allocator 34 and the prize data 18 then allocates an
   appropriate prize to the player dependent on the amount

   While the present embodiment is described in relation to a
   game wherein a player proceeds to a succeeding level if at
   least one of the numbers on the players dice is greater
   than or equal to the highest number shown on the reference
35 dice, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.   For example, the game may be implemented such
   that a player proceeds to a succeeding level if at least
                                                     10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

   one number on the players dice is equal to the highest or
   lowest number shown on the reference dice, less than or
   equal to the lowest number on the reference dice, or less
   than the lowest number on the reference dice.

   Referring to Figure 8, there is shown a flow diagram 280
   which illustrates   steps 282 to 298 of an alternative
   method of gaming implemented by the gaming system 10.
10 In this example, the player is allocated 3 dice for use
   during the game and the player can bet 1 or more credits
   on the outcome of the game with an increase of the bet
   placed having the effect of multiplying the possible prize
   amount allocatable for each level of the game.
15
   With this example, the gaming system implements a game
   wherein a player advances to a succeeding level of the
   game if the sum of the numbers shown on a players dice
   throw is greater than the sum of the numbers shown on a
20 player's previous dice throw.
   In one particular example, the symbols on each of the dice
   are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, and 2 dice are allocated to the
   player.
25
   The symbol selector 22 first selects 2 first numbers for 2
   respective first player dice 300,      302, then selects 2
   second numbers for 2 respective second player dice 304,
   306, as shown in Figure 9a.       The first player dice 300,
30 302 are used in the first level of the game as reference
   dice.
   The comparator 30 compares the sum Ti of the numbers on the
   reference dice 300,   302 with the sum T 2 of the numbers on
35 the second player dice   304,   306 and if  T 2 is greater than
   or equal to Ti the player proceeds to the next level.                If
   T2 is less than T1 , the multilevel game ceases and the
                                                          10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

   outcome generator 32, in association with the prize
   allocator 34 and the prize data 18, then allocates an
   appropriate prize to the player dependent on the amount
   bet and the prize amount associated with the first level.

   In the present example, the sum of the numbers on the
   reference dice 300,   302 is 7 and the sum of the numbers on
   the second dice 304,    306 is 8.     Accordingly, the player is
   able to proceed to the second level.
10
   At the second level, the second dice 304,       306 are retained
   and used in the second level of the game as reference
   dice, and the symbol selector 22 selects 2 third numbers
   for 2 respective third player dice 308, 310 as shown in
15 Figure 9b.
   The comparator 30 then compares the reference sum Ti of the
   numbers on the reference dice 304,       306 with the sum T2 of
   the numbers on the third player dice 308,       310 and if T 2 is
20 greater than or equal to Ti the player proceeds to the
   third level.  If T 2 is   less than T1 , the multilevel game
   ceases and the outcome generator 32,       in association with
   the prize allocator 34 and the prize data 18, then
   allocates an appropriate prize to the player dependent on
25 the amount bet and the prize amount associated with
   reaching the second level.
   In the present example, the sum of the numbers on the
   reference dice 304,   306 in 8 and the sum of the numbers on
30 the third dice is 9 308,     310.    Accordingly, the player is
   able to proceed to the third level.
   At the third level, the third dice 308, 310 are retained
   and used in the third level of the game as reference dice,
35 and the symbol selector 22 selects 2 fourth numbers for 2
   respective fourth player dice 312, 314 as shown in Figure
   9c.
                                                          10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

                               - 25
   The comparator 30 then compares the reference sum Ti of the
   numbers on the reference dice 308, 310 with the sum T2 of
   the numbers on the fourth player dice 312,   314.   If T2 is
 5 greater than or equal to T1 , the player is deemed
   successful at the third level.
   In the present example, the sum of the numbers on the
   reference dice is 9 and the sum of the numbers on the
10 third dice is 10.   Accordingly, the player is successful
   at the third level.
   The outcome generator 32, in association with the prize
   allocator 34 and the prize data 18 then allocates an
15 appropriate prize to the player dependent on the amount
   bet and the prize amount associated with success at the
   third level.
   While the present embodiment is described in relation to a
20 game wherein a player proceeds to a succeeding level if
   the sum of numbers on the players dice is greater than or
   equal to the sum of numbers on reference dice, it will be
   understood that other arrangements are envisaged.       For
   example, the game may be implemented such that a player
25 proceeds to a succeeding level if the sum of numbers on
   the players dice is equal to, greater than, or less than
   the sum of numbers on the reference dice.
   The present examples are described in relation to a
30 multilevel game played by one player.    However, it will be
   understood that other arrangements are envisaged such as a
   game played by multiple players, with for example the
   symbols on each player dice being compared with the
   symbols on a single set of reference dice, or compared
35 with each other and relative rankings between players
   determined so as to determine which players are eligible
   to advance to the next level.
                                                      10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

                               - 26
   For example, in one variation several players are playing
   reel type gaming machines and during game play a special
   feature is triggered for at least some of the players
 5 which renders the players eligible to enter a special
   tournament game.   In order to enable all players to view
   symbols generated during the tournament game, an overhead
   display may be provided.
10 The gaming machine associated with each player selects one
   die symbol and the selected die symbols are shown on the
   overhead display.   The symbols on the dice are compared
   and ranked in accordance with predetermined rules, such as
   from highest number to lowest number, and the top 3 ranked
15 dice are retained.   The other dice are discarded and the
   players associated with the discarded dice may receive a
   prize.
   The gaming machines associated with the remaining 3
20 players then select one die symbol and the selected die
   symbols are shown on the overhead display.   The symbols on
   the dice are compared and ranked in accordance with
   predetermined rules, such as from highest number to lowest
   number, and the top 2 ranked dice are retained.   The other
25 die is discarded and the player associated with the
   discarded dice receives a prize.
   The gaming machines associated with the remaining 2
   players then select one die symbol and the die symbol is
30 shown on the overhead display.   The symbols on the dice
   are compared and ranked in accordance with predetermined
   rules, such as from highest number to lowest number, and
   the top ranked dice is awarded a special prize.   The other
   die is discarded and the player associated with the
35 discarded dice receive a prize.
                                                     10466234_1.docx 12/07/18

                              - 27
   The remaining player in the tournament game may be offered
   further opportunities to receive additional prizes, for
   example by throwing a die and comparing the number on the
   die with a prize schedule.

   It will be appreciated that the above described specific
   examples both operate such that the game implemented by
   the gaming system tends to have a success probability
   which decreases with each succeeding level.  In this way,
10 as the game progresses, the player becomes less likely to
   succeed in reaching a higher level.
   Modifications and variations as would be apparent to a
   skilled addressee are deemed to be within the scope of the
15 present invention.
