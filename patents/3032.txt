                                 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0003] The invention relates to the suppression of populations of certain insect species such
as flies.
                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0004] The house fly, horse fly and other members of their family are not only a nuisance,
they are pests at both homes and farms, and often they are laden with disease causing
organisms. In developed countries, typically flies are the most common species found on hog
and poultry farms, dairy farms, horse stables and ranches where they are associated with
feces and garbage. In developing countries, with poor public hygiene and sanitation that is
elementary or less than elementary, the accompanying undesirable very high fly population is
a serious public health problem. Fly induced stress and illness is a major source of revenue
and energy drain for industrial animal farming operations and the public sector.
[0005] Many good efforts have been made to suppress fly population in urban and farm
settings. Apart from improved public and private sanitation, keeping windows screened and
doors closed, sticky traps (fly paper) and ultraviolet light traps (non-chemical control) placed
around a home or business also can reduce housefly populations. They normally function by
electrocuting flies that enter the trap.
[0006] In industrial farming operations, for example in commercial egg production facilities,
flies densities may be suppressed by the application of insecticides (adulticides or larvacides)
directly or indirectly to where the flies congregate or their favorite resting locations.
However, resistance to commonly used insecticides is increasingly problematic. For example,
                                                    -1-

    WO 2015/013110                                                                 PCT/US2014/047105
fly populations that are subjected to a continuous permethrin regime on industrial farms have
rapidly developed resistance to permethrin. Treating manure with insecticide, though this
method is highly discouraged as it interferes with biological control of flies, often results in a
rebound of the fly population. In some cattle and horse ranches, insecticides (especially insect
growth regulators) are fed to livestock, and residual insecticide in the manure inhibits fly
breeding. Continuous exposure of flies to insecticides has led to development of resistance to
many insecticides.
[0007] Chemical control suppression of the fly population has been partially effective and
there exists a need for a new method or system to effectively suppress the fly population.
This new method should be accomplished in a manner that does not result in insecticide
resistance. There is a need for a method that is ecologically not toxic.
                               SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

    WO 2015/013110                                                                 PCT/US2014/047105
                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0039] Disclosed herein is a highly effective and efficient system for suppression of varies
species of insects. In some embodiments, the system is effective for suppression of one or
more species of insects within the insect subclass Pterygota. Pterygota includes the winged
insects and insect orders that are secondarily wingless (that is, insect groups whose ancestors
once had wings but that have lost them as a result of subsequent evolution). In some
embodiments, the device and methods described herein are configured to effectively attract,
kill, or suppress one or more species of true flies or flies of the order Diptera. In some
embodiments, the systems and methods described herein are effective for attracting, trapping,
killing, or suppressing populations of flies selected from the group consisting of black flies,
cluster flies, crane flies, deer flies, face flies, flesh flies, green flies, horn flies, horse flies,
house flies, sand flies, sparaerocierid flies, yellow flies, western cherry fruit flies, tsetse flies,
cecid flies, phorid flies, sciarid flies, stable flies, mites, and gnats. In some embodiments, the
system or method is effective for suppression of house and horse flies. In some embodiments,
the attractant may be modified to trap tsetse fly. In some embodiments, the system and
methods are effective for suppression of tiny insects including mosquitoes.
[0040] Systems and methods described herein can exhibit selectivity in attracting, killing, or
suppressing an insect population of one or more insect species. The selectivity can be gender
selectivity. In some embodiments, the systems and methods described herein effectively
attract both males and females of one or more insect species. In some cases, the attractant of
this invention has a very high affinity for the females of a species. In some cases, the
attractant of this invention has a very high affinity for the females of a species. The
selectivity can be species selectivity. In some embodiments, the system or methods described
herein are configured to more effectively attract, kill or suppress the population of one or
more first insect species to a greater degree than one or more second insect species. For
example, the system or methods disclosed herein can be effective for selectively suppressing
a population of house flies and/or horse flies while not suppressing the population of a second
insect species. In some embodiments, the second insect species is an Apis. In some
embodiments, the second species is selected from the group consisting of grasshopper, bee (ie
honeybee) and butterfly.
[0041] Deployment of a system or device disclosed herein, or use of a method disclosed
herein can suppress an insect population in a specified environment. Non-limiting examples
of environments which can exhibit suppressed insect populations of one or more insect
                                                        -8-

    WO 2015/013110                                                         PCT/US2014/047105
species include farmland, horse pastures, poultry pastures, grazing and non-grazing livestock
ranch, slaughterhouses, meat and fish processors, dairy farms, hog farms, beaches,
restaurants, homes, boats, recreational park areas, produce farms, hospitals, landfills,
mushroom farms, waste management facilities, or composting.
[0042] The insect trap apparatus as described herein comprises a container which holds the
attractant. In some cases, the trap further comprises one or two additional parts, wherein the
additional parts are selected from a lid and a modified cover. The attractant, container,
optional lid, and modified cover are each described in further detail herein.
[0043] In some non-limiting embodiments, the apparatus (20) is configured as in Fig. 2. In
some embodiments, the container is covered by a lid or shade (21) which is optionally coated
with thermal paint (22). The lid can be attached to the container by a seal structure (23) which
is optionally coated with an opaque coating (24). In some embodiments, a modified funnel
(25) rests above the container but below the trap shade. The modified funnel comprises one
or more apertures for fly entrance (26). In some embodiments, the container holds the
attractant (27).
[0044] In some non-limiting embodiments, the apparatus (30) is configured as in Fig. 2. In
some embodiments, the container is covered by a lid or shade (31) which is optionally coated
with thermal paint (32). The lid can be attached to the container by a seal structure (33). In
some embodiments, the top of the container comprises one or more orifices (34) for small
insects. In some embodiments, a modified funnel (35) rests above the container but below the
trap shade. The modified funnel comprises one or more apertures for fly entrance (36). In
some embodiments, the container holds the attractant (37).
[0045] In some embodiments, the apparatus (10) comprises a lid configured according to Fig.
1. In some embodiments of the lid, a canopy (11) rests above the lid. In some embodiments,
the canopy is coated with thermal paint (12). In some embodiments, the top of the lid below
the canopy comprises one or more apertures for fly entrance (13). In some embodiments, a
convex/concave structure (14) is disposed directly below the aperture. The outside of the lid
(15) can be clear or opaque. In some embodiments, the cap attaches to the container below it
via a screw mechanism, for example by screwing a cap thread structure (16). In some
embodiments, a seal structure (17) is disposed above the cap thread.
[0046] One unique aspect of this invention is the observation that the incorporation of
particulate materials and some dyes in the attractant material suppresses the emergence of
maggots from the trapped flies in the deployed traps. The suppression of fly egg
development/elimination of maggots reduces the risk of insect resistance to the attractants of
                                                   -9-

    WO 2015/013110                                                           PCT/US2014/047105
this invention. The attractant may be deployed in container with modified cover and the
various flies of interest enter the container and are overwhelmed by the attractant and exhibit
no inclination to escape from the said container. The attracted flies may die from drowning,
starvation, hypoxia, or from compounds emanating from the attractant or from unknown
causes. Because no fly escapes from the said attractant container, the incidence of resistance
is remote and less likely.
[0047] The methods, devices, or systems described herein, each comprise an attractant. The
attractant is a composition that attracts one or more species of insects. Additional examples of
attributes that make a composition an acceptable attractant can include specificity in
attracting only desired insect species, ability to be synthesized inexpensively from organic
materials, very low toxicity to humans and animals (horse, cattle birds, chicken etc.) when
deployed, and low environmental toxicity of the waste products after deployment. In some
embodiments, the organically formulated attractant does not contain synthetic pesticides. Use
of an attractant composition with low environmental toxicity can enable the waste material
after deployment to be compostable used as a fertilizer, food for an animal such as a bird or
fish.
[0048] In some embodiments, the attractant composition comprises an attractant precursor
composition, a dye, and optionally a particulate additive.
[0049] In some embodiments, the attractant precursor composition comprises biomass
material. The attractant composition can comprise biomass materials from one or more
animal sources, plants sources, or a combination thereof. The biomass from an animal source
or plant source can be aquatic biomass, terrestrial biomass, or a combination thereof. The
biomass can be industrial or non-industrial biomass. In some embodiments, to reduce cost
and/or improve effectiveness, the biomass material used to synthesize the attractant can be
biomass waste. The biomass waste may comprise of visceral or somatic parts or excretions,
including manure.
[0050] The attractant can comprise biomass from an animal source. For example, animal
biomass can include terrestrial biomass such as slaughterhouse waste, food and non-food
wastes, poultry processing plant wastes, swine processing wastes, dead stock, spoiled meat,
and spoiled poultry. The fish biomass can include marine animals, freshwater animals, fish
flotsam, vertebrates, invertebrates, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments,
mollusks such as cephalopods, gastropoda, bivalvia species may be used as the precursor
material. For example, cuttlefish, mussels, octopus, squids, may be used alone or combined
with clams, oysters, scallops, mussel, snails, slug and their likes for precursor material. In
                                                    -10-

other embodiment, marine water biomass or fresh water biomass may be used alone or in
combination. In one embodiment, terrestrial biomass waste may be combined with fresh
water or marine biomass or aquatic flotsam for precursor material.
[0051] In some embodiments, terrestrial and aquatic plants may be used for precursor
material. In one example terrestrial plants such castor oil seed may be boiled and fermented
as an attractant. The fermented and unfermented seeds may be combined in appropriate
proportions. In another example aquatic plants such as kelp may be fermented as an attractant
for this invention. The fermented and unfermented plant may be combined in appropriate
proportions as the precursor material or as attractant material. In one embodiment, terrestrial
or aquatic biomass may be applied as precursor or as attractant for this invention. In some
applications, materials from plant and animal sources may be combined and applied as a
precursor or as attractant for this invention.
[0052] In some embodiments, the attractant comprises one or more dyes. An effective dye
can emit light that increases the attraction of insects, is relatively inexpensive, exhibits low
toxicity to humans and animals while deployed, and is safely disposed of after deployment. In
some cases, the attractant may comprise a single dye. Alternatively, the attractant can
comprise multiple dyes. In some embodiments, the attractant comprises a fluorophore or
fluorescent dye. In some embodiments the dye comprises edible dyes, injectable dyes,
parenthral dyes, or nontoxic dyes and preferably biodegradable dyes. The fluorescent dye
may be hydrophilic or hydrophobic in nature. The attractant may comprise one or more
fluorescing ultra-violet dyes, or dyes that fluoresce within visible or non-visible spectrum of
light. The dye may be added to the precursor material prior to the fermentation step. More
may be added if desirable. In some applications, the dye may be incorporated into the
attractant post fermentation.
[0053] In some embodiments, the dye is selected from the group consisting of acridine dyes,
cyanine dyes, fluorone dyes, oxazin dyes, phenanthridine dyes, and rhodamine dyes. In some
embodiments, the dye is selected from the group consisting of acridine orange, acridine

[0054] In some embodiments, the attractant comprises an amount of one or more dyes less
than 1.0%, 0.9%, 0.8%, 0.7%, 0.6%, 0.5%, 0.4%, 0.3%, 0.2%, 0.1%, 0.05%, 0.01%,
0.00010%, 0.000010%, 0.0000010%, or 0.00000010% on a dry matter basis (wt/wt). In some
embodiments, the attractant comprises an amount of one or more dyes greater than 1.0%,
0.9%, 0.8%, 0.7%, 0.6%, 0.5%, 0.4%, 0.3%, 0.2%, 0.1%, 0.05%, 0.01%, 0.0001%,
0.00001%, 0.000001%, or 0.0000001% on a dry matter basis (wt/wt). In some embodiments,
the attractant comprises an amount of one or more dyes less than 5% but greater than 1.0%,
0.9%, 0.8%, 0.7%, 0.6%, 0.5%, 0.4%, 0.3%, 0.2%, 0.1%, 0.05%, 0.01%, 0.0001%,
0.000010%, 0.0000010%, or 0.00000010% on a dry matter basis (wt/wt). In some embodiments,
the attractant comprises between 0.01 ppm and 1,000 ppm of one or more dye.
[0055] In some embodiments, the attractant comprises a dye having an emission wave length
less than 800, 750, 700, 650, 640, 630, 620, 610, 600, 590, 580, 570, 560, 550, 500, 450, 400,
350, 300, 250, 200, or 150 nm. In some embodiments, the attractant comprises a dye having
an emission wave length greater than 150, 200, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, 330,
340, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, or 800 nm. In some embodiments, the
attractant comprises a dye having an emission wavelength between 200 and 700 nm, 250 and
650 nm, or between 300 and 600 nm. In some embodiments, the attractant comprises a dye
with an emission wavelength between 300 and 600 nm. In some embodiments, the attractant
comprises a dye with an emission wavelength between 200 and 400 nm.
[0056] The attractant can comprise a particulate additive, a colloidal material, or a
combination thereof. A particulate or colloidal material as an additive can stabilize the
attractant composition and increase the shelf life. Additionally, it is observed that the
incorporation of particulate materials in the attractant material may suppress the emergence
of maggots from the trapped flies in the deployed traps. The suppression of fly egg
development/elimination of maggots reduces the risk of insect resistance to the attractants of
this invention. In some embodiments, the attractant comprises of one or more colloidal
materials including particulates. In some embodiments, particulates or colloidal material may
be added to the precursor material or formulated into the attractant post fermentation.
[0057] In some embodiments, the attractant comprises one or more particulate additives
selected from the group consisting of polymer clay, ball clay, Edgar plastic kaolin, silicon
powders, bentonite clay, carbon particulates, activated carbon, volcanic ash, kaolinitic clays,
montmorillonite and treated saw dust. In some embodiments, the attractant comprises one or
                                                   -12-

    WO 2015/013110                                                            PCT/US2014/047105
more particulate additives selected from the group consisting of montmorillonite, and treated
saw dust. In some embodiments, the attractant comprises one or more carbohydrates or
carbohydrate moieties such as glue, starch or gelatinized starch. The attractant of this
invention may be formulated with colloidal materials to form an emulsion or semi
solid/liquid media. The combination of dead flies and the emulsion can form a semi-solid or
sludge. The resulting semi-solid or sludge can be an efficient attractant, and further cause
insects to come into the container.
[0058] In some embodiments, the attractant comprises an amount of particulate additives less
than 90, 85, 80, 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.5, or
0.1% on a dry matter basis (wt/wt). In some embodiments, the attractant comprises an
amount of particulate additives greater than 90, 85, 80, 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 35,
30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.5, or 0.1% on a dry matter basis (wt/wt). In some
embodiments, the attractant comprises an amount of particulate additives greater than 10, 5,
4, 3, 2, 1, 0.5, or 0.1% and less than 90, 85, 80, 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25,
or 20% on a dry matter basis (wt/wt). In some embodiments, the attractant comprises an
amount of particulate additives between about 0.001% and about 20% or between about at
least less than 10% a dry matter basis (wt/wt). In some application the particle size of the
particulate material is greater than 5 millimeters and in some embodiments the particulate
material size is less than 5mm, less than 0.5mm, less than 100 microns, less than 10 micron
less than 1 micron, less than 0.1 micron. In some embodiments, the particle size of the
particulate material may range between 0.5 to 100nm. In some embodiments, the particulate
material comprises on nano-particles. In some embodiments, the particulates comprise
spherical particles, non-spherical particles, ordered particles, disordered particles, magnetic
particles, non-magnetic particles, particles with a magnetic dipole, material or materials,
particles with self-assembly capabilities, charged particles, uncharged particles, colored
particles, uncolored particles, or combinations thereof.
[0059] The attractant can prevent the trapped insects from breeding. In some embodiments,
the attractant prevents the laying or hatching of insect eggs. In some embodiments, eggs laid
by insects within the device cannot hatch in the presence of the original attractant. In some
embodiments, the attractant comprises an insecticide such as a maggocide or larvacide that
renders eggs unviable. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the eggs can hatch but maggots
are not able to survive in the attractant composition within the device. The attractant can
prevent by replication by comprising an amount of a known insecticide. Alternatively, the
chemical conditions of the attractant can prevent the replication. In some embodiments, the
                                                     -13-

    WO 2015/013110                                                            PCT/US2014/047105
attractant comprises additives to enhance massive egg laying by the attracted flies and
massive fly eggs hatching to form very large maggot colonies.
[0060] The attractant composition can be synthesized by combining the attractant precursor
composition, one or more dyes, and one or more particulate additives. One or more
components of the attractant can be subjected to a processing step prior to, during, or after
combining the components together. For example, the attractant precursor can undergo a
processing step prior to combining with the dye and particulate additives. In some
embodiments, the components are combined together and then subjected to one, two, three,
or four processing steps. In some embodiments, one or more components of the attractant are
separately subjected to a processing step, the components are combined together, and then the
combined components are subjected to one or more processing steps. Non-limiting examples
of processing steps include, washing, sterilizing, cutting, chopping, milling, grinding,
blending, fermenting, cooking, filtering, adjusting pH, formulating, dehydrating, freeze
drying or packaging.
[0061] In some embodiments, one or more components of the attractant are subjected to a
physical processing step to adjust the particle size of the material. For example, attractant
precursor may be chopped in to smaller sizes, ground, or milled to finer particulates or semi
solid. It is desirable that the chopping or milling process be performed at a temperature that
does not degrade or destroy the precursor material of interest. In embodiments that feature
both a physical processing step and a fermentation step, the physical processing step can
occur before, during, or after transferring to the material to a fermentation vessel to ferment
one or more attractant components.
[0062] One or more components of the attractant or attractant precursor can be sterilized. In
some embodiments, the attractant precursor is sterilized. In examples that include fermenting
one or more attractant components, it can be advantageous to sterilize biomass prior to the
fermentation step. For example, aquatic or terrestrial biomass may be partial or fully
sterilized. Some non-limiting examples of sterilization techniques include cooking, boiling,
microwaving, subjecting to steam treatment, exposure to hot water, UV exposure, or a
combination thereof. In some embodiments, the precursor material may be exposed in hot
water for a period less than 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,
0.5, 0.1 minutes. In some embodiments, the precursor material may be exposed to hot water
for a period varying between 5 seconds to 60 seconds. In some embodiments, the attractant
precursor material can be sterilized prior to a fermentation step. The treated biomass may
admixed or infused with ground cephalopod or effluent from a fermented cephalopod. The

infected or inoculated biomass may be further applied as the precursor material or as
attractant material. Similar treatments can be applied to aquatic biomass, aquatic waste, fish
flotsam or and their combinations thereof with terrestrial biomass. In some embodiments, the
attractant components that were not subjected to the sterilization step (such as fluorescent
agents or dyes) are mixed with the precursor material before the fermentation process.
Alternatively, the attractant components that were not subjected to the sterilization step (such
as fluorescent agents or dyes) are mixed with the precursor material after the fermentation
process.
[0063] In some embodiments, one or more components of the attractant precursor
composition is fermented in a fermentation vessel. The fermentation vessel may be open, but
preferably closed during the fermentation process. The fermentation step may be performed
in a pressurized, semi-pressurized, or variable pressure atmosphere. The fermentation may be
aerobic, partially aerobic or anaerobic. In one embodiment, the container may be exposed to
ambient light or light of known wavelength. The light exposure can occur continuously or at
desirable intervals. Alternatively, in some embodiments, photons are excluded form
interacting with the contents of the vessel during the fermentation step. The fermentation
reaction may occur at a temperature below 100, 95, 90, 85, 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40,
35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, or 0 0C. In some embodiments, the fermentation reaction may occur
at a temperature above 100, 95, 90, 85, 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15,
10, 5, 0, -5, or -10 C. In some embodiments, the fermentation reaction occurs between the
temperatures of -10 C and 90 0C, or between 0 0C and 60 0C.
[0064] In some embodiments, at least one component of the attractant composition is
subjected to an anaerobic fermentation process. The anaerobic fermentation of the one or
more components of attractant is performed in the presence of carbon dioxide, inert gases
(i.e. nitrogen), or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, yeast may be added to the
precursor material before or post fermentation prior to packaging for deployment. Also yeast
and dry ice may be combined for the synthesis of the attractant composition from the
attractant precursor material or materials. In other applications, carbohydrate or carbohydrate
bearing moieties may be added to the precursor material before or post fermentation prior to
packaging. In some embodiments, the attractant or the attractant precursor may comprise of
water, yeast, carbohydrate or carbohydrate bearing moieties, biomass, urea and urea moieties
and dry ice. The source of water may be from well, stream, tap and other sources of water
such as deionized water or distilled water. In some applications it may be preferable that the
water be de-oxygenated and de-halogenated (free of halogens) prior to use as a precursor
                                                   -15-

    WO 2015/013110                                                           PCT/US2014/047105
material. It is preferable that water is free of contaminants that may degrade the efficiency of
the fermentation process. These various precursors may be combined in various combinations
thereof. In some embodiments, fermentation can be initiated by addition of a sample of a
previously-fermented attractant composition.
[0065] The deployed synthesized attractant may contain partially fermented or fully
fermented precursor materials solids, liquid, semi-solid and the fermentation process may
continue in the field during deployment. In some applications, the unfermented and
fermented precursor may be mixed for deployment in the field. The effluent or semi-solid
materials or solids from the anaerobic reaction may be collected and used as an attractant by
itself. In some applications the effluent may be combined with various agents describe in the
invention and deployed in trapping container. For example the attractant system may
comprise of the fermentation products of marine and fresh water animals, disposed in
container.
[0066] After the completion of the synthesis of the attractant composition, the attractant can
be formulated. Formulation can increase or improve the chemical stability, physical stability,
overall effectiveness, duration of effectiveness, appearance, packaged density, shelf life,
and/or aroma of the attractant composition. The formulated attractant may be dehydrated or
freeze dried to prolong shelf life and later be reconstituted with water and other known
materials for field deployment. The pH of the attractant may be controlled and stabilized as
needed by known methods (i.e. addition of a pH buffer) to a pH less than 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5,
4, or 3. The pH of the attractant may be controlled and stabilized to a pH greater than 10, 9, 8,
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2. In some embodiments, the pH is controlled and stabilized to a pH between
2 and 10. In some embodiments, the pH is controlled and stabilized to a pH between 5 and 9.
In some embodiments, attractant formulation can include the addition of physical components
to change the structure, characteristics, color, or appearance of the attractant composition.
Non-limiting examples of physical components that can be added to formulate the attractant
include carbohydrate or carbohydrate moieties, additional particulate materials, treated saw
dust, colloidal materials, clay, clays or combination of various clays, activated and non
activated charcoal, resinous materials such as gums (i.e. guar or xanthan gum). In some
embodiments, the attractant formulation step comprises addition of yeast, fluorescent dye, or
particulate materials to the attractant composition. In some embodiments, the attractant
formulation comprises one or more surfactants. In some embodiments, the attractant
formulation comprises up to 5% of a surfactant composition (wt/wt). In some embodiments,
the attractant formulation comprises a surfactant composition between about 20 ppm and
                                                     -16-

5000 ppm. In some embodiments, the surfactant material comprises a biodegradable
surfactant.
[0067] The insect trap as described herein comprises a container which holds the attractant.
In some cases, the trap further comprises one or two additional parts, wherein the additional
parts are selected from a lid and a modified cover. The container, optional lid, and modified
cover are each described in further detail herein.
[0068] A device for the effective suppression of a population of certain insect species can be
constructed from a container and the attractant described herein. The container can be an
open container or a container with an opening or aperture through which the insects can enter
the container. The dimensions of the jar can be important for the effectiveness of the trap. An
effective container should be large enough to hold a quantity of attractant compositions
sufficient to attract the desired insects, and be large enough to hold the insects to be trapped
and killed. Similarly, in some embodiments, an effective container is small enough to be
transported and deployed in the area which it is desired to suppress the at least one species of
insect.
[0069] The container can be configured to be of a certain dimension. In some embodiments,
the container has an interior volume of at least 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900,
1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 4000 or 1000OOmL. In some embodiments, the container has
an interior volume of less than 60000, 5000, 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000, 900, 800, 700, 600,
500, 400, 300, 200, or 100 mL. In some embodiments, the container has an interior volume
between about 100-10000 mL; 200-1500 mL; or 500-1500 mL. In some embodiments, the
container is configured to be filled up to at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60,
65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 97, or 99% of its interior volume with the attractant. In some
embodiments, the container is configured to be filled up to less than 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35,
40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 97, or 99% of its interior volume with the
attractant. In some embodiments, the container is configured to hold at least 100, 200, 300,
400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000 or 60000 mL of attractant. In some embodiments, the
container is at least 1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26,
28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, or 100 inches tall. In some embodiments, the container is less than 5, 6,
7,8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 44, 48, 52,
56, or 100 inches tall.
[0070] The shape of the container dictates the ratio of the surface area to volume of
attractant. In some embodiments, the shape of the container is selected such that the volume
of attractant is sufficient to attract enough insects into the container to completely cover the
                                                     -17-

surface of the attractant. This layer of dead insects can form a barrier or seal which can
increase in the effectiveness of the attractant. In some embodiments, the container is
substantially cylindrical, conical, spherical, cubical, or a right rectangular prism. In some
cases, the container is substantially cylindrical. In one embodiment, the container comprises
curvilinear profile or shape.
[0071] In some embodiments, the body of the container may be coated with infra-red
reflecting paint including thermal paint or paints. In some applications portions of the
container may be coated with infra-red reflecting paint or paints. The application of infra-red
reflecting container or containers for the attractant deployment reduces the evaporation of the
attractant and prolongs the longevity of the deployed fly suppression system in the field. In
some embodiments, when evaporation of the deployed attractant has occurred, water is added
to the attractant to maintain effectiveness. In some embodiments, the active life of the
deployed attractant is at least 20, 30, 40 50, 80, 100, 130, 150 or 180 days or more.
[0072] In some cases, the upper portion of the body may be opaque or coated with opaque
material. In some other embodiments, a fluorescing material may be coated on the body of
the container or incorporated into the structure of the said trap container. In one embodiment,
a pulsing or non-pulsing light emitting diode (LED) may be deployed in close proximity to
deployed fly suppression system. In some applications the wavelength of the LED may be
turned in response to the nature of the fly or insect or insects of interest.
[0073] In some embodiments, the container is configured such that the majority of insects (of
the one or more species to be trapped) that have entered the container do not exit the
container. This is advantageous from a pest control perspective because when no insects
escape from the attractant container, the incidence of resistance is remote and less likely. In
some embodiments, the various insects of interest enter the container and are overwhelmed
by the attractant and exhibit no inclination to escape from the container. In some
embodiments, the various insects of interest enter the container and are unwilling or unable to
find the exit to the container. The attracted insects may die from drowning, starvation, from
compounds emanating from the attractant, from unknown causes, or combinations thereof.
The container can be configured to create an anaerobic seal. In some embodiments, the
attracted flies die and form a layered structure over the attractant. The dead flies structure can
form an anaerobic seal and a substrate over the attractant to create a self-propagating
anaerobic system. The anaerobic seal or dead fly layer structure can be non-hermetic. For
example, materials produced by the anaerobic action in the attractant can diffuse through the
dead fly layer (anaerobic seal) or structure into the external ambient environment to attract
                                                    -18-

    WO 2015/013110                                                           PCT/US2014/047105
more flies thereby creating a self-propagating open system. In some embodiments, fluids
from the attractant may percolate upward through the anaerobic seal to furnish nutrients and
attractants for incoming flies. The layered fly structure may be semi-solid layer. In some
embodiments, the attractant fluid wets the flies and prevents their escape. The thickness of
the anaerobic seal can increase as more dead flies and accumulate in the layer. In some
embodiments, the thickness of the anaerobic seal is at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or more than
10cm. In some embodiments, the thickness of the anaerobic seal is between about 5 cm and
about 100 cm.
[0074] In some instances, the container is placed in a hole dug in the ground. In cases
wherein the container is placed in a hole dug in the ground, the size of the container is not
limited by strength of hanging materials, and the container can be either of the sizes described
herein, or of an exceptionally large size. For example, in cases wherein the container is
placed in a hole dug in the ground, the container can have an internal volume of at least 5, 6,
7,8,9,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70,75,80,90,100,110,120,130,14,
150, 200, 250, 300 or 400 Liters. As deployed, insects enter the container via the apertures
around the top of the container to feed on the nutrients in the attractant disposed in the
attractant container. In some embodiments, the container placed in a hole dug in the ground is
a decomposable container. In such embodiments, at least one method is used to affect the
sealing of the bottom of the jar to the ground to suppress the escape of flies and leakage of
fluids from the attractant from the container bottom. For example, a thin rubber sheet or skirt
is adapted around the bottom of the jar and overlaying the ground surface. Soil material is
arranged or packed around the bottom of the trap jar and the ground surface to seal the
bottom of the jar with respect to the ground.
[0075] In some embodiments, the attractant container comprises of a biodegradable material.
In some applications the biodegradable container with dead trapped flies may be composted
with other biodegradable materials. Also, in some embodiments a biodegradable plastic or
fluid proof bag may be disposed inside the attractant container as an insert to contain the
attractant. The attracted dead flies in the biodegradable bag can be separated from the
supporting container and composted. A replacement bag can be deployed in the attractant
container for a fresh attractant deployment.
[0076] In some embodiments, the attractant container comprises more than one canopy
assemblies or more than one discrete canopy assemblies disposed over the container jar. In
some embodiments, the canopy assembly is as labeled in Fig 6A. The canopy assembly
optionally comprises one or more elements selected from group consisting of a trap shade, a
                                                   -19-

    WO 2015/013110                                                          PCT/US2014/047105
canopy, a fly funnel, and entry apertures. In some embodiments, the attractant container is a
large volume container (for example, more than 5 liter of attractant). In a device featuring a
large volume container, a single canopy assembly containing 1 to 4 apertures can limit the
number of flies per unit time accessing the large volume of the attractant beneath the canopy
assembly. To increase the efficiency in some such cases, the number of canopy assemblies is
scaled to match the volume of the attractant in the container. For example, an attractant
container with 5 liters of attractant can comprise 2 or 3 separate canopy assemblies disposed
over the attractant, and a 20 liter attractant can comprise 4 to 8 canopy assemblies. The
deployment of multiple canopy assemblies or assembled canopies over the attractant jar or
container offers each insect more openings and opportunities to reach the attractant beneath.
The deployment of multiple assembled canopies per container can increase the flux of the
attractant in the area surrounding the trap which can attract more flies to the trap. The upper
portion of the trap containing multiple assembled canopies may be attached to the container
with one of the mechanisms known in the art. For example, the canopies can be attached with
quick release clamps, fastener mechanisms, adjustable fasteners, or movable hooks. It is also
preferable that flexible sealant or gasket be incorporated between the container and the dome
portion containing the canopies to suppress any egress of attractants from these regions. In
some embodiments, the lid of the attractant container may contain multiple apertures for flies
to enter the trap. Other devices may be attached to the said apertures. In some embodiments,
the arrangement of the apertures in the trap follows a geometric pattern. In some
embodiments, at least two assembled canopies are attached to the fly container and fa lamp or
light source is also attached the container. A device comprising a large volume container may
comprise one or more apertures for removing dead flies after device deployment, by
mechanical means, or by vacuum, for example. The evacuated container may be cleansed if
desirable before refilling with a fresh attractant.
[0077] In some embodiments, the lip or the cover of the container is adapted with two or
more apertures. The said apertures can communicate between the inside of the container and
the outside environment where the pest inhabits. In some embodiments, there is no direct line
of sight between the apertures on opposite sides of the lid or cover. The inside portion of the
lid may comprise curvilinear features or non-curvilinear structures. The inside of the lid may
be adapted with one or more features such as a shaped tubular extension that is conic, convex,
concave, or a combination thereof. For example, the lid can have a two shaped tubular
extensions, wherein the first is concave, and the second is convex in shape.

    WO 2015/013110                                                             PCT/US2014/047105
[0078] In some embodiments, the interior of the lid comprises a coating or a light absorbing
material. In some applications, the outer surface of the lid is coated with fluorescing
material. For example, at least a portion of the outside surface of the lid can be coated with at
least one ultra-violet fluorescing dye, pigment, paint, or combination thereof. In field
deployment, insects enter the container via the apertures in the cap to come closer to the
attractant disposed in the container. In some embodiments, an insect in the interior of the
container cannot have a direct line of site to light outside of the container. In some cases, an
insect in the interior of the container cannot see light from outside the top portion of the
container and the attached lid.
[0079] In some embodiments, two or more apertures may be disposed in the upper portions
of the container, or the container and the lid. The apertures in the lid and the container may be
partially or fully coincident when the lid is attached to the container for deployment. The
formulated media is disposed in a container and the lid of the container comprises a modified
funnel with or without shaped shaft or apex.
[0080] Portions of the inside of the lid comprise a sealing material to prevent materials
emanating from the container from leaking from the periphery of the lip. The lid may be
attached to the container by known methods. In some embodiments, the lid is screwed to the
main body of the container or the lid is fastened to the container with quick release
mechanisms.
[0081] In some embodiments, the attractant is disposed inside the container and the top of the
container is adapted to support one or more filter materials that exclude flies from the
attractant. Non-limiting examples of filter materials include porous plastic, cloth, textiles,
screens, biomass, or packed particulate matter. Non-limiting examples of particulate
materials include clay materials, silicon powder, diatomaceous earth, infra-red absorbing
particulates with or without moisture absorbing particulates. Additionally, in some cases,
particulate materials can be disposed over the filter material. Compounds emanating from the
attractant can diffuse through the support filter to the outside to attract flies. Also, portions of
the attractant can be adsorbed on the particulates disposed over the filter. The attracted fly
lands on the particulate, ingesting particulates, and rolling all over the materials disposed
over the porous surface. The attracted flies may die from the particulate clogging of their
respiratory and digestive system. In some embodiments, the particulates or the infrared
absorbing particulates may thermally degrade the flies. In some instances, depending on the
nature of the particulate media, the attracted flies lay eggs in the dry or moist particulate
media. The majority of the laid eggs may die undeveloped and the majority of maggots
                                                    -21-

    WO 2015/013110                                                                PCT/US2014/047105
emanating from the developed laid eggs may die by thermal degradation, or dehydration or
from unknown causes. In some embodiment the some of the upper portion of the container or
portions of the cap may comprise of infra-red absorbing layer (not shown). The heat
absorbing layer raises the local temperature of the coated area and assist in discouraging fly
larvae or maggots from escaping from the container. Maggots creeping along the wall of the
vessel in regions over the anaerobic seal layer falls back in to seal surface when the contact
the relatively hotter portion of the trap coated with infra red absorbing layer. Fly eggs laid in
the proximity of the coated area are thermally degraded and do not hatch in to larva. In some
embodiments, maggots in the thermal zone die from thermal degradation.
[0082] In one embodiment of this invention, the attractant may be deployed in container with
modified cover and the various flies of interest enter the container and are overwhelmed by
the attractant and exhibit no inclination to escape from the said container. The attracted flies
may die from drowning, starvation, or from compounds emanating from the attractant or
from unknown causes. Because of the low incidence of flies escaping from the said attractant
container, resistance is remote and less likely.
[0083] In some cases, an array of insect traps comprising a plurality of insect traps positioned
in proximity to each other, is effective for reducing the population of one or more insect
species. In some embodiments, the array comprises at least two traps cluster in an area of less
than 100 square feet. In some embodiments, said traps are present in an area of less than 50,
30, 20, 10 square feet. In some embodiments, the array comprises at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or
10 insect traps. In some embodiments, the array is capable of suppressing the population of
one or more species of insect of an area greater than 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0,
7.0 or 10 acres. In some embodiments of the array, the one or more species are selected from
the group consisting of black flies, cluster flies, crane flies, deer flies, face flies, flesh flies,
green flies, horn flies, horse flies, house flies, sand flies, sparaerocierid flies, yellow flies,
western cherry fruit flies, tsetse flies, cecid flies, phorid flies, sciarid flies, stable flies, mites,
and gnats. In some embodiments, each insect trap comprises a chemical attractant. In some
embodiments, each insect trap comprises a volume of attractant of at least 100, 200, 300, 400,
500, 600, 700, 800, 900, or 1000 mL. In some embodiments, each trap is configured to
capture and kill the insect such that the killed insect is deposited above or with the insect
attractant layer. In some embodiments, each insect trap is a device described herein.
[0084] In some embodiments, when the deployed container is deemed sufficiently filled, the
flies are removed from the container. In some embodiments, when the deployed container is
deemed sufficiently filled, the flies are removed from the container by separating the top jar
                                                       -22-

   WO 2015/013110                                                             PCT/US2014/047105
from the attractant container. Alternatively, for large industrial applications, the container
may be adapted with one or more apertures for evacuating the dead flies by means of vacuum
and refilling the container with a fresh attractant. The deployed attractant container in the
cavity can be deemed sufficiently filled with dead flies when at least 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85 or
90 % of the volume of the container is full of dead flies. In some cases, the container
comprises an attractant container and a separate top jar that holds at least a portion of the
dead flies. The dead flies may be buried, recycled or composted as seen fit. In some
embodiments, the container and the transparent jar may be deployed on the ground and when
the insides container is sufficiently filled with dead flies, the covering jar may be separated
and the dead flies are buried and disposed of according to local ordinance.
[0085] Depending on attractant formulation, the trapped flies may lay copious amount of
eggs. The laid eggs die undeveloped and any maggot or maggots emanating from the
developed laid eggs die by thermal degradation, or dehydration as moisture in the sludge in
the open dishes evaporates. The dead flies mass may be composted and in some applications
the content of the dishes may be treated with small amount of bleach prior to disposal
according to local ordinance.
[0086] In one disposition of this invention to rapidly suppress flies in a given area, effluent or
semi-solid or attractant of this invention may be formulated for example with colloidal
materials to form an emulsion or semi-solid (solid-liquid) media. The formulated media is
disposed in a decomposable trap dish or trap container and placed in a dug hole in the ground.
The attracted flies roll and swim in the emulsion in the container and die. The dead flies are
buried by covering the dug hole with soil materials. In some instances small amount of
ammonium nitrate or may be added to the dead fly sludge before burial.
                                           EXAMPLES
[0087] Example 1: A series of 20 liter batches of attractants were prepared by mixing 0.1 to
10 kg of processed aquatic biomass and a quantity of water to reach 20 liters total volume. In
some of the mixtures, dry ice (0.1 to 2kg), yeast (0 to 1 kg), and sugar (0 to 1 kg) were added
and the mixture underwent an anaerobic fermentation reaction. Finally, dye (0 or 5 ppm to
1000 ppm) and particulate matter such as clay (0 to 500g) were added to some of the
mixtures.
[0088] Example 2: A particular batch of attractant from Example 1 is made by mixing 4.0 kg
processed aquatic biomass (processed by blending in a blender) and purified, de-halogenated
water (19 liter). The material is cooled to room temperature, and then yeast (100 g) and sugar
                                                    -23-

(100 g) are added. The material is placed in a large container and portions of dry ice are
slowly added until the full amount dry ice is added (2 kg) without lowering the temperature
of the overall mixture below 20 0C. The mixture is allowed to bubble with CO 2 gas to remove
oxygen from the system. After the attractant mixture stops bubbling, the container is sealed
and the mixture undergoes an anaerobic fermentation reaction at 35 0C for 2 days. The
mixture is cooled to room temperature, and clay (1 teaspoon), and 2 drops dye are added
(AutoPro 375 Antifreeze/Coolant UV Dye 1; supplied by IDQ Corporation - 2901 West
Kingsley Road, Gartland Texas 75041).
[0089] Example 3: A fly trap lid according to FIG. 1 was constructed. The exterior surface of
the canopy was painted with thermal paint. The aperture of fly entrance was constructed to be
convex/concave, and the lid was configured to be attached to the container via screw thread.
[0090] Example 4: Insect traps were constructed according to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3. The exterior
of the canopy was painted with thermal paint to form a trap shade. A jar (4 L) was used as the
container and filled with the attractant of Example 2. The lid was a modified tunnel featuring
two apertures for fly entrance. One of the insect traps had additional orifices for small insects
on the exterior wall of the container according to FIG 3. The other insect trap did not have
such orifices according to FIG. 2.
[0091] Example 5: A trap comprising an attractant of the invention was deployed in an
outdoor setting that was in direct sunlight as shown in FIG 4A an FIG 4B. The fly trap was
photographed 60 min after deployment as shown in FIG 4A. Dead flies begin to cover the top
of the attractant and live flies remain in the container. The fly trap was photographed 3 days
after deployment as shown in FIG 4B. At this time point, the large number of dead flies form
a thick layer on top of the attractant. This layer formed an anaerobic seal structure. The fly
trap was photographed 6 days after deployment as shown in FIG 4C. At this time point, the
large number of dead flies formed a very thick layer on top of the attractant which was an
anaerobic seal structure. A close up of the deployed (nearly full) trap is depicted in FIG 5.
This shows the large number of trapped dead flies and the relatively low amount of visually
apparent maggots in the mixture.
[0092] Example 6: The experiment of example of 5 was repeated, however the insect trap
was deployed in an outdoor setting that was in the shade. A photograph of the deployed trap
is shown in FIG 6A and a close-up photograph of trapped flies is shown in FIG 6B and FIG
7.
[0093] Example 7: Horses were photographed on a horse farm that does not contain any
insect traps disclosed herein and the photograph is shown in FIG 8A. The horses are stressed
                                                    -24-

    WO 2015/013110                                                           PCT/US2014/047105
and spending energy to swat and react to flies in the environment. Several days after
deployment of the insect traps described herein on the horse farm, a horse was photographed
and the photograph is shown in FIG 8B. The horse now lacks the visually apparent elevated
stress level and is not shown spending energy to react to flies in the environment. This result
can be considered confirmation that the population of local flies has subsided after the
deployment of the insect traps described herein.
[0094] Example 8: Horses manure was photographed on a horse farm that does contain
insect traps disclosed herein and the photograph is shown in FIG 9A. The fresh and dry
manure does not contain maggots or horse flies. Also, the horse manure maintains the
original shape and disposition on the ground because the manure was not scattered by birds
scavenging for maggots in the manure. This is indicative of a very effective large local fly
population suppression in the environment. Several days after deployment of the insect traps
described herein on the horse farm, horse manure was photographed and the photograph is
shown in FIG 9B. The manure now lacks the visually apparent divots from the maggots that
would be indicative of a large fly population in the environment. The dried horse manure
retained its original shape, profile and disposition because it was not contaminated by flies,
maggots and not affected by other wild birds scavenging for food. This result can be
considered confirmation that the population of local flies has subsided after the deployment
of the insect traps described herein.
[0095] Example 9: The contents of the insect trap of example 5 were examined 6 days after
deployment. The mixture of attractant solution and flies was emptied onto the soil to be used
as fertilizer and food for other animals. Photographs of the fertilizer on the ground are shown
in FIG 10 and FIG 11.
[0096] Example 10: An insect trap as disclosed herein was deployed in an outdoor
environment directly next to a commercially available wasp trap. Six days after deployment,
the two traps were examined and photographed (FIG 12). The insect trap as disclosed herein
trapped primarily flies and did not trap a visually apparent number of wasps. This result
indicated the species selectivity of the insect trap as disclosed herein.
[0097] Example 11: Four different attractant compositions (A, B, and C) were placed in
identical container/lid insect trap devices disclosed herein, and the traps were deployed in an
outdoor environment as an experiment to test the efficacy of the attractant compositions. The
insect trap device containing attractant composition A is shown at three different time points
in FIG 13A, 14A, 15A (60 minutes, 3days, 6 days respectively after deployment). The insect
trap device containing attractant composition B which was the attractant composition A and
                                                    -25-

    WO 2015/013110                                                           PCT/US2014/047105
further comprising dye A is shown at three different time points in FIG 13B, 14B, 15B (60
minutes, 3days, 6 days respectively after deployment). The insect trap device containing
attractant composition C which was only water and used as control is depicted in FIG 15C,
six days after deployment. As can be seen from the amount of flies trapped in the traps,
effluent B was much more effective than control D.
[0098] Example 12: An array of fly traps as described herein was deployed in an outdoor
environment in close proximity to one another. The cluster of insect traps were photographed
6 days after deployment and displayed in FIG 16. The trap labeled A in FIG 16 was deployed
containing an attractant composition comprising ground aquatic biomass. The trap labeled B
in FIG 18 was deployed containing an attractant composition comprising the effluent from
the same aquatic biomass without a grinding step. The trap labeled C in FIG 16 was
deployed with an attractant comprising an excess amount of the dye relative to the other
deployed traps. The trap in FIG 17 was deployed containing an attractant composition
consisting essentially of water (for a control).
[0099] Example 13: The fly trap of example 10 (Attractant B) was deployed without dye.
The insect trap devices are shown in FIG 18A, 6 days after deployment, and a population of
maggots is visually apparent in the attractant composition.
