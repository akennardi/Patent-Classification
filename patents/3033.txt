   Detailed Description
 5
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   having a game controller arranged to implement a game
   wherein an outcome occurring in an independent table game
   can trigger an event on one or more gaming devices.                      For
10 example, one or more prizes can be awarded to players of
   the gaming devices in response to the triggered event.
   General construction of gaming system
15 Gaming devices or gaming systems capable of participating
   in the method of gaming of the embodiment can take any
   suitable form including stand alone gaming machines and
   server based gaming terminals.
20 The gamign system can take a number of different                 forms.
   In a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components  required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
25 In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components  required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming terminal
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming terminal.
30 For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming terminal and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server;  or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
35 executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming terminal is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
                                       7972931_1 (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3 4/10/2012

                               - 6
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
 5 wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.           For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode,  "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
10 depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
15 core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface  50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
20 input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions and play the game.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
25 credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54,              a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions                 (e.g. to
   place a wager),  and one or more speakers 58.
30
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor                    62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
35 display. Typically, the game play instructions are stored
   as program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
                                       7972931_1 (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3 4/10/2012

                               - 7
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:                   a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable                logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
 5  (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   A gaming device in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 202 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   202 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
10 displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 202
   houses a bank of buttons 22   for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
15 mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.       Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
20 such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module                  (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device,                   for
25 example as part of a loyalty program.          The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
30 by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module.
35 A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.               Further
                                        7972931_1  (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3 4/10/2012

                               - 8
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.    A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 202.
 5
   The display 14  shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.  Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
10 display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.    The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14,     or of a different
   type.
15
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
20 The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.          Typically, the
25 gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
30 The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output   (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
35 peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
                                        7972931_1  (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3 4/10/2012

                               - 9
   devices.   A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers  for use by the processor 102.               Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
 5
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 comprise one or more displays              106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107   (which provide a game play
10 mechanism),  speakers or audio output      (not shown),             a card
   and/or ticket reader 108, a printer 109, a bill acceptor
   and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a coin output
   mechanism 111.   Additional hardware may be included as
   part of the gaming machine 100,   or hardware may be omitted
15 as required for the specific implementation.                For example,
   while buttons or touch screens are typically used in
   gaming machines to allow a player to place a wager and
   initiate a play of a game any input device that enables
   the player to input game play instructions may be used.
20 For example, in some gaming machines a mechanical handle
   is used to initiate a play of the game.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface,  for example a network card 112.
25 The network card may, for example,    send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                       In
30 embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
35
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
                                        7972931_1 (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3 4/10/2012

                              - 10
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                    The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                    The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
 5 some system or game related code.    The mass           storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code        from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
10
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
15
   In a client server architecture a gaming device is
   provided by a gaming client and game server             (and
   optionally other gaming network components).             A gaming
   client has a similar outward appearance to gaming machine
20 202 but the game server implements most or all of the game
   and as such acts as the game controller while the terminal
   operated by the player essentially provides only the
   player interface.  The gaming terminal receives player
   instructions, pass these to the game server which will
25 process them and return game play outcomes to the gaming
   machine for display.
   Figure 5 shows that a gaming device may be connected
   within a gaming system 200 which provides additional
30 and/or enhanced functionality.   The gaming system 200
   includes a network 201,  which for example may be an
   Ethernet network.  Gaming machines 202,         shown arranged in
   three banks 203 of two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5,
   are connected to the network 201.    The gaming machines 202
35 provide a player operable interface and may be the same as
   the gaming machines 202,  100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or
   may have simplified functionality depending on the
                                       7972931_1  (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3 4/10/2012

                             - 11
   requirements for implementing game play.         While banks 203
   of two gaming machines are illustrated in Figure                5, banks
   of one, three or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
 5 One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
10 and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
15 202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
20 and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.           A    loyalty
25 program server 212 may also be provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
30 provides only the player interface.     With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
35 display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
                                      7972931_1 (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3 4/10/2012

                             - 12
   computer input and output components.         Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
   client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
 5 incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200,           including for
   example a gaming floor management  server 208, and a
10 licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
15 The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks,  for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
20 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques,  functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.    For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one        server or a
25 separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
30 provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.

   being played by a player of a gaming device is provided.
   The event is triggered using an outcome of an independent
   table game.   The execution and result generation for the
   table game,  for example a roulette game,        is completely
 5 independent of the game being played using the gaming
   device.  Results generated in the gaming device game do
   not influence the outcomes of the table game or any other
   play aspects,  such as the pace of play and amounts bet for
   the table game.   Players of the table game may be unaware
10 that outcomes of their table game may be used to trigger
   events for gaming devices.
   The event triggered for the gaming devices may be an event
   independent of regular game play, such as the awarding of
15 a jackpot, bonus or progressive prize.        Prizes awarded as
   a result of the triggered event may be allocated from
   award pools.   The award pools may be common to a plurality
   of gaming devices or exclusive to a gaming device.
20 Embodiments can use any table game and be applied to
   gaming devices used for playing any type of game.                     The
   triggering outcome of the table game is completely
   independent of the game being played by the player using
   the gaming device.   Thus the table game outcome occurs
25 randomly relative to the gaming device game irrespective
   of whether or not the triggering outcome of the table game
   itself is a random result.
   Embodiments may be applied for stand alone gaming
30 machines, or networked client/server gaming devices having
   "thick client" or "thin client"  architectures.                Figure 7
   illustrates a system 700 comprising a table game 710 and
   stand alone gaming machines or "thick client" gaming
   devices 720a-n, wherein each gaming device includes all or
35 substantially all the components required to implement
   game play.   The gaming devices 720a-n receive game outcome
   data from the independent table game 710 via a network
                                       7972931_1 (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3  4/10/2012

   730, for example via a gaming system monitoring network.
   Each gaming device 720a-n includes a game controller 740a
   n and a player interface  750a-n.   The game controller
   740a-n of each gaming device 720a-n in this embodiment
 5 includes most or all the components     required to implement
   a game in response to player instructions input via the
   player interface 750a-n.   The game controller 740a-n of
   each gaming device can be further adapted to trigger an
   event in response to receiving a signal from the gaming
10 table 710 indicating a given outcome of the table game has
   occurred.
   Figure 8 illustrates a system 800 comprising a table game
   810, game controller 845 and "thin client"            gaming machines
15 820a-n.   In this "thin client" embodiment the game
   controller 845 substantially controls game play for each
   of the gaming terminals 820a-n.    The gaming terminals
   820a-n each include a processor 840a-n and a player
   interface  850a-n.  The processor 840a-n of each gaming
20 terminal 820a-n in this embodiment includes a local client
   adapted to implement only some aspects of game execution.
   The game controller 845 receives game outcome data from
   the independent table game 810 via a network 830,                    for
25 example via a gaming system monitoring network, which may
   also be the network used for communication between the
   game controller 845 and the gaming terminals 820a-n.                         The
   game controller 845 triggers an event in response to
   receiving a signal from the gaming table 810 indicating a
30 given outcome of the table game has occurred.
   The gaming table 710,  810 may be provided with an outcome
   monitor 715,  815 and only send an event trigger signal
   when a given outcome occurs.    For example, if the gaming
35 table is a roulette table, the trigger outcome may be
   specified as the wheel spin landing on         "0"    or "00",
   alternatively the outcome may simply be the end of a wheel
                                        7972931_1  (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3 4/10/2012

                              -  15
   spin or based on an amount paid to players of the table.
   Any of these given outcomes occurring causes a signal to
   be generated at the gaming table 710,       810 and transmitted
   via the network 730,  830 for reception by the game
 5 controllers 740a-n, 845.   The table game may be hard wired
   to send a signal for a given result,      for example using a
   sensor in the "0" and "00"   wheel positions.             Alternatively
   outcome information for every outcome of the table game
   could be transmitted to the game controller which in turn
10 monitors these outcomes to determine when the trigger
   condition has been met.
   The game controllers 740a-n, 845 can be adapted to process
   the trigger outcome in accordance with game rule.                       For
15 example, a trigger may be generated in response to the
   trigger outcome occurring in an independent table game and
   this trigger may be applicable for one or more gaming
   devices 720a-n, 820a-n.   A trigger may be generated for
   every trigger outcome occurring in the independent table
20 game or when a threshold number of trigger outcomes have
   occurred based on game rules.    For example, where the
   trigger outcome is simply the beginning or end of a
   roulette wheel spin, the trigger condition for triggering
   the event may be five hundred wheel spins.               It should be
25 appreciated that the trigger conditions are defined in
   game rules and can vary from game to game.              The trigger
   conditions may be variable under control of a casino
   operator.  For example, a threshold number of outcomes may
   be variable or varied based on an associated prize.
30 Alternatively the game rules may include trigger condition
   rules for more than one type of independent table game and
   the rules applied be altered in accordance with the table
   game type the gaming system is configured to receive the
   trigger outcome from.
35
   Where a player is playing a gaming device an award may be
   made in accordance with the game rules         for the trigger
                                        7972931_1  (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3  4/10/2012

                              - 16
   condition.   However, it may be possible in some embodiment
   for a trigger outcome to occur while not all of the gaming
   devices 720a-n, 820a-n are being played.           In such
   circumstances game rules may be applied for the handling
 5 of the trigger.
   For example, in a first embodiment the application of the
   trigger may be delayed until a player beings play of the
   gaming device.   In this case a trigger can be held for a
10 game device, for example stored in memory, for application
   once a player being to play a game using the gaming
   device, for example when the next bet is placed.                   The
   application of the trigger condition may also be delayed
   until the player fulfils eligibility criteria, such as
15 placement of an additional bet.   In a second embodiment,
   if at the time a trigger occurs a gaming device is not
   currently being played, the trigger may simply be deleted.
   In a third embodiment, if at the time a trigger occurs a
   gaming device is not  currently being played, any award
20 playable for the trigger may be accumulated to be paid to
   the next player of the device in response to a further
   trigger.   For example, the award which would normally be
   payable to a player can be accumulated in an award pool so
   this is paid out in addition to any award payable in
25 response to a next trigger condition.        Alternatively, the
   trigger could cause a "double" condition to be set,                    such
   that the next award made to a player in response to a
   trigger is doubled.   It should be appreciated that these
   are examples of game rules which may apply for triggers
30 generated for a gaming device in the absence of a player
   for the device and that further variations are envisaged.
   Enabling a trigger occurring for a gaming device in
   absence of a player to be applied for the next player of
   the gaming device can serve to increase player attraction
35 and entertainment for the gaming devices.
   In an alternative embodiment, instead of the table game
                                       7972931_1 (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3 4/10/2012

                               -  17
   sending a trigger to the gaming devices or game
   controller, the trigger may be sent to a jackpot
   controller which then implements a trigger event.                        For
   example,  for a mystery link, an independent roulette table
 5 may send a signal to a   jackpot controller every time an
   outcome of "0"  or "00".   The  jackpot controller may record
   these trigger signals and once a defined number of trigger
   signals have been received, a message could be sent to a
   gaming device to pay an award.
10
   The gaming devices  720a-n, 820a-n and the gaming tables
   710,  810 are shown connected via a gaming network 730,
   830.   The gaming network may include more than one table
   game and in some embodiments it may be possible to
15 configure the system to associate each gaming device
   selectively with a table game.     This configuring may be
   performed by a gaming venue operator.          Alternatively some
   configuring control may be given to the gaming device
   player.   For example, a player may select whether to
20 participate in an event triggered from a roulette table
   game or a card table game when they opt in to the
   triggered event.   In response to the player's opt in
   instruction the gaming device will be associated, by the
   game controller, with the appropriate gaming table game.
25
   An example of a game controller for use in various
   embodiments is illustrated in Figure       6.      The game
   controller 60 has a processor 62 and memory 64.                     The
   controller may be connected to a player interface                     50
30 directly, for example in a stand alone embodiment, or via
   a network.   The game controller includes all the
   components  required to implement a regular gaming device
   game.   For example, the memory 64   stores game data 610
   such as game rules  615 and symbol data 612 for one or more
35 games played using the gaming device.           The processor                62
   uses the game data 610 for implementing the game, the
   processor can include software, firmware and/or hardcoded
                                         7972931_1  (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3  4/10/2012

                              - 18
   hardware functionality used for implementing game play
   such as an outcome generator 640 for generating outcomes
   for the game, which may include a symbol selector 645,                       an
   outcome evaluator 660 for evaluating game outcomes to
 5 determined whether winning criteria are met, and a display
   controller 670  for controlling the manner in which the
   game outcomes are displayed on the display 54 of the
   player interface 50.   An award manager 650 adapted to
   determine and control the payout of awards for the game
10 can also be included in the game controller.
   In game controller embodiments adapted for triggering an
   event in response to an outcome of an independent table
   game, the game controller 60 includes a trigger monitor
15 665 adapted to receive trigger information from the
   independent table game.   The trigger information may be a
   trigger signal,  simply indicating the event is to be
   triggered.   This trigger signal may be transmitted in
   response to a designated outcome occurring in the table
20 game.   Alternatively, the trigger information may be
   outcome data for the table game which is analysed by the
   trigger monitor 665 to determine whether the outcome which
   occurred is a designated outcome for triggering an event
   to occur on the gaming device.
25
   Various events may be triggered in response to the
   designated table game outcome occurring.          For example, the
   triggered event may be play of a feature game for which
   different awards are payable, a free play, an award etc.
30
   In some embodiments, typically the award will be
   independent of the game being played using the gaming
   device.   For example, the event may be an event which
   results in an award being allocated to one or more players
35 of the gaming devices.   The award may be made to all
   players or a selected number of players.          For example, an
   award of a bonus prize may be made to the player who
                                       7972931_1 (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3 4/10/2012

                              - 19
   starts the first game after the trigger.          Alternatively, a
   bonus may be awarded to a player as a result of a lottery
   drawn in response to the trigger.    In other embodiments,
   awards may be made to players fulfilling given criteria,
 5 such as having exceeded a threshold bet amount.
   The game controller can include an award manager 650
   adapted to determine an award for one or more players of
   the gaming devices in response to the triggered event.
10 The award manager can use award data 630 stored in memory
   64 for determining the award for each player.                The award
   data 630 can comprise one or more prize pools 635a-c, each
   prize pool may be associated with a given player or group
   of players.  Alternatively each prize pool may be
15 associated with a designated trigger condition.                  Any
   possible variation is contemplated within the scope of the
   present invention.
   In a stand alone game machine embodiment, the award
20 manager can be implemented as part of the game controller
   to determine whether or not to make the award for the
   player of the gaming machine.   For example, a stand alone
   game machine may maintain a local award pool exclusive to
   the gaming machine and dedicated to the triggered event.
25 Contributions to the triggered event award pool can be
   made using a portion of the credit wagered on the gaming
   machine.  The portion of credit may be a portion of a
   regular bet to play the gaming machine game or contributed
   from an additional or ante bet payed to opt in to the
30 triggered event.   When the triggered event occurs an award
   can be determined for the player base on the size of the
   local award pool.   The award may be the full amount of the
   local award pool or a portion of the local award pool
   dependent on the embodiment implemented.           The portion of
35 the award pool awarded to the player may be dependent on a
   player fulfilling eligibility criteria,        such as a
   threshold cumulative bet amount.   Alternatively the
                                       7972931_1 (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3 4/10/2012

                             - 20
   portion of the award pool awarded to the player may be
   dependent on another random process, such as a dice roll
   by the player.  Such an embodiment has the advantage of
   providing additional entertainment for the player.
 5
   In an alternative embodiment, stand alone game machines
   may be linked via a network for the purpose of making an
   award based on the table game trigger.         For example, a
   central award pool may be provided and the award manager
10 of each gaming machine can be adapted to award a portion
   of the central pool in response to the trigger condition.
   For example, in an embodiment where a group of ten stand
   alone gaming machines are linked together to a table game,
   then a bonus can be awarded to each player of the gaming
15 machines for the triggered event from the central award
   pool.  In response to a designated table game outcome
   occurring, each player may be awarded one tenth of a bonus
   pool maintained for the group.   The amount of the bonus
   pool may be based on the amount wagered from the group of
20 ten gaming machines.  Alternatively the bonus pool may be
   independent of the gaming machines, for example the bonus
   pool may be sponsored by the gaming venue or a third party
   and prizes awarded in the form of vouchers for goods and
   services or merchandise, credit prizes could also be
25 provided.
   In a thin or thick client embodiment a central award
   manager may be provided to determine awards for one or
   more players using a plurality of gaming devices.                      In this
30 embodiment one or more central award pools can be
   maintained by the award manager.   Each gaming device may
   contribute to the central award pools,        for example by a
   portion of the amount bet being allocated to the award
   pool, or ante bets paid to opt in to the triggered event
35 being allocated to the award pool.     Alternatively or in
   addition to one or more central award pools, award pools
   exclusive to each gaming device may also be used.                      In such
                                       7972931_1  (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3  4/10/2012

                             -  21
   an embodiment a portion of an ante bet paid for a player
   to be eligible for the triggered event can be allocated to
   the central award pool and a portion to the local, gaming
   device exclusive, award pool.    Awards can be made to the
 5 player form either the central or local award pool based
   on award rules defined for the embodiment implemented.
   For example, in one embodiment an award may be made form
   the local award pool in response to a first game outcome
   occurring in the table game and an award made from the
10 central award pool in response to a second game outcome
   occurring in the table game.    Alternatively awards for the
   triggered event may also be made from award pools
   associated with the regular game,   for example where the
   event is an additional outcome or   scatter pay for a
15 regular game, then the awards may be made to each player
   in accordance with the regular game award rules from the
   regular game award pool.
   In an alternative embodiment, in response to a triggered
20 event, an award can be made to every eligible player from
   the respective local prize pools for the gaming devices
   and an award from the central award pool made to a
   selection of eligible players, for example in response to
   a random process occurring as part of the triggered event
25 such as a dice roll or lottery.
   In an alternative embodiment, eligibility criteria may be
   defined for the central award pool, for example a player's
   cumulative bet total must have achieved a threshold level
30 to be eligible for an award form the central award pool.
   In this embodiment awards may be made from the local prize
   pool in response to the triggered event until the
   eligibility criteria is met.
35 The game controller triggers an event to occur on gaming
   devices in response to a designated trigger outcome
   occurring in the table game.    The trigger event can be the
                                        7972931_1 (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3 4/10/2012

                              -  22
   award of a prize.   Alternatively, the event may be an
   alternative award, for example the award may involve
   effects such as playing sounds and animations on each of
   the gaming devices,  flashing lights etc or some other form
 5 of recognition.   Further, an additional game could be
   played as part of the event, such as a lottery draw, dice
   roll,  coin toss, fee game etc.   The outcome of this
   additional game can be used to determine any award due to
   each player.
10
   An example of a game play process will now be described
   with reference to Figure 9.    The game play process starts
   with the player entering game play instructions using the
   player interface of the gaming device       905,     this can
15 include placing a wager to play a game.           In this
   embodiment a player can choose whether or not to opt in
   910  for the triggered event, this may include paying an
   ante bet.   The regular game is played 920 in response to
   the player's instructions.
20
   Independent of the regular game being played using the
   gaming device, outcomes are generated for a table game
   930.   If an occurring table game outcome is a designated
   trigger outcome 932,  then a trigger signal is sent to the
25 gaming devices 935.   Once the trigger signal is sent the
   table game continues 938.    The players of the table game
   may not be aware that a trigger signal has been sent.
   Further, sending the trigger signal can have no influence
   on play of the table game.    For example, the table game
30 may be a roulette game.   A sensor or controller may be
   adapted to determine when the roulette wheel spin outcome
   is 0 or 00,  such that when one of these outcomes occurs a
   trigger signal is sent to one or more game controllers for
   the gaming devices.
35
   In response to receiving the trigger signal 940,                  the game
   controller can check whether the player as opted in or
                                        7972931_1 (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3 4/10/2012

                              - 23
   otherwise eligible  for the triggered event 942.                  If the
   player is not eligible, then regular game play simply
   continues 980.   Where the player is eligible             for the
   trigger event 942,  the regular game play may be
 5 interrupted 945 for the trigger event 950.             As part of the
   trigger event prizes for one or more players can be
   determined 960 and awarded 970.    An award manager can
   determine which players to make awards to based on award
   rules.  Further the award pool chosen for making awards
10 can also be determined based on award rules.                For example,
   an award may be made to one player, such as a linked
   progressive prize awarded from an award pool which is
   funded from wagers placed through a group of participating
   gaming devices, or a local gaming device prize awarded
15 from an award pool exclusive to one gaming device.                      Once
   an award for the event is made 970 play of the regular
   game continues 980.
   It has been described in the example above that play of
20 the regular game is interrupted by the triggered event.
   However, in alternative embodiments the event may be
   triggered in response to the outcome of the table game but
   the execution of the triggered event may be delayed until
   a given phase of game play, for example the event
25 execution may be delayed until the completion of a game
   round or current game action, such as a reel              spin, dice
   roll or card deal.   As the occurrence of the trigger
   outcome in the table game is completely independent of the
   gaming device game, the trigger outcome may occur at any
30 time during game execution.    In some embodiments the
   trigger outcome may occur at a time when a player is
   ineligible for the event, depending on the phase of game
   play, for example before a player has opted in for the
   triggered event.   Whether or not a trigger is stored to be
35 applied at a later time, when the player is eligible for
   the event, is dependent on the game rules for the
   embodiment.  In some embodiments, only trigger outcome
                                        7972931_1 (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3 4/10/2012

                               -  24
   occurring within an eligible window of game play may cause
   the event to be triggered.
   It has been described above that a player can opt in for
 5 the triggered event.    However, in some embodiments a
   player's entitlement for the triggered event may be
   determined automatically.     For example, a group of gaming
   devices may be associated with the table game under the
   control of a gaming venue operator and any player of one
10 of the gaming devices is automatically eligible for the
   triggered event.    Alternatively, a player may become
   automatically eligible in response to fulfilling
   eligibility criteria, for example based on an amount
   wagered, cumulative win meter total, a game outcome
15 occurring in a gaming machine game, or based on a player
   loyalty system such as a threshold number of loyalty
   points accumulated.    In some embodiments a player may,
   instead of opting in for the triggered event, nominate to
   opt out of the triggered event if they are automatically
20 determined eligible.
   Although the above embodiments have been described in
   combination with a roulette table game and outcomes "0"
   and "00", alternative table games and outcomes may also be
25 used.   For example, the table game may be a card game and
   a trigger signal sent each time an outcome of four of a
   kind occurs, alternatively the table game may be a dice
   game and a trigger signal sent each time a double six is
   rolled.   Any table game could be applied in embodiments of
30 the present invention.
   Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate that the
   method of the embodiment could be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
35 ways, for example on a computer readable medium, such as a
   disc or a memory   (for example, that could replace part of
   memory 103)  or as a data signal   (for example, by
                                         7972931_1 (GHMatters) P79645.AU.3 4/10/2012
