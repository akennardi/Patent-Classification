          COMBINATIONS OF MODALITIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF DIABETES
                                                            FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]                        The present invention relates generally to the field of autoimmune disease
and specifically to the treatment, prevention, or delayed progression of Type 1 diabetes
mellitus using a combination of a CTLA4 fusion protein and a Type 1 diabetes
autoantigen.
[0001A]                       This is a divisional of Australian patent application No. 2013284469, the
entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                                                 BACKGROUND
[0002]                        The most common form of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (TI DM) is an
immune-mediated disease where insulin-secreting p-cells are destroyed by an autoimmune
response. There are a number of genetic and environmental factors associated with the
onset of the disease, which involves the progressive inflammatory infiltration of pancreatic
islets containing immunocytes targeted specifically to insulin-secreting p-cells. This
pathology develops over an indeterminate period of time (months to years). While the
discovery of insulin allowed for the treatment of TI DM, there is currently no cure. The
most common form of Type 1 diabetes mellitus is immune-mediated, in which insulin
producing               P cells       are destroyed. Yet, at the time of diagnosis, most patients still have
appreciable amounts of insulin production. Preservation of residual 1-cell function is
highly desirable because it can reduce short-term and long-term complications of the
disease.
[0003]                         Several clinical trials have been undertaken in an attempt to arrest
autoimmunity in Type 1 diabetes with immunomodulatory agents or antigen-based
treatments. Most notably, trials of anti-CD3, anti-CD20, and a GAD-65 antigen vaccine
have shown some efficacy in preservation of p-cell function as evidenced by stimulated C
peptide secretion. T cells play a central part in autoimmunity associated with Type 1
diabetes.
                                                                       1

[0004]                        Reintroduction of autoantigen, such as insulin B-chain, in incomplete
Freund's adjuvant (IFA), has also been contemplated for the treatment or delayed
progression of Type 1 diabetes. This has been studied in animal models of diabetes (NOD
mice) (Muir et al. (1995) J Clin Invest 95:628-634; Orban et al. (1999) Diabetes 48 Supp.
 1:A216-A21                   7; Ramiya et al. (1996)        J Autoimmun 9:349-356); U.S.   Pat Pub.

Autoimmun. (2010 Jun);34(4):408-15.
[0005]                        However, there is need for additional new therapies for Type 1 diabetes
mellitus that are able to halt or slow autoimmune p-cell destruction and thus prevent
development of Type 1 diabetes, or at least prolong onset of the disease for as long a
period of time as possible.

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0019]        It has been found that a combination of a CTLA4 molecule and insulin-B chain in IFA
can be used for the treatment, prevention, or delayed progression of Type I diabetes mellitus in a
subject.

 WO 2014/004866                                                                    PCT/US2013/048247
[0020]        Preservation of residual p-cell function (as measured by peak C-peptide >0-2 nmol/L) is
highly desirable because it can reduce short-term and long-term complications of the disease. Several
clinical trials have been undertaken in an attempt to arrest autoimmunity in Type I diabetes with
immunomodulatory agents or antigen-based treatments. Most notably, trials of anti-CD3, anti-CD20,
and a GAD-65 antigen vaccine have shown some efficacy in preservation of p-cell function as
evidenced by stimulated C-peptide secretion. C-peptide is a protein that is produced in the body along
with insulin. In a healthy pancreas, preproinsulin is secreted with an A-chain, C-peptide, a B-chain,
and a signal sequence. The signal sequence is cut off, leaving proinsulin. Then the C-peptide is cut
out, leaving the A-chain and B-chain to form insulin.       Since C-peptide and insulin are present in
equimolar amounts, it is a highly reliable marker for insulin production and the health of pancreatic   P
cells.
[0021]        T cells play a central part in autoimmunity associated with Type I diabetes. To become
fully activated and autoaggressive, T cells are believed to need at least two crucial signals. (Marelli
Berg FM, Okkenhaug K, Mirenda V. A Trends Immunol 2007; 28: 267-73.)               The first signal is an
interaction between an antigen in the groove of the MHC molecule on antigen-presenting cells and the
T-cell receptor (TCR). The most important second signal is the interaction between CD80 and CD86
on the antigen presenting cells (APCs) and CD28 on the T cells. This costimulatory second signal is
needed for full activation of cells, and without it T cells do not become functional. Therefore, co
stimulation    blockade has    been   proposed    as a therapeutic   modality   for autoimmunity      and
transplantation. (Bluestone JA, St Clair EW, Turka LA. Immunity 2006; 24: 233-38.)
[0022]        Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), which is also known as CD152,
is a protein involved in the regulation of the immune system.           Naturally occurring CTLA4 is
described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,434,131, 5,844,095, and 5,851,795.          Natural CTLAl proteins are
encoded by the CTLA4 gene.          CTLA4 is a cell surface protein, having an N-terminal extracellular
domain, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain
binds to and/or interferes with target antigens, such as CD80 and CD86, serves as nature natural break
of T cell stimulation. In some embodiments, the extracellular domain of the CTLA4 molecule begins
with methionine at position +1 and ends at aspartic acid at position +124; in other embodiments, the
extracellular domain begins with alanine at position -1 and ends at aspartic acid at position +124.
[0023]        A CTLA4 molecule is a molecule comprising a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
antigen 4 (CTLA4) extracellular domain. In some embodiments, the extracellular domain of CTLA4
comprises a portion of the CTLA4 protein that recognizes and binds to at least one B7 (CD80/86)
antigen such as a B7 antigen expressed on B cells and on antigen presenting cells (APCs).         The B
cells and APCs may be activated. The extracellular domain may also include fragments or derivatives
of CTLA4 that bind a B7 antigen.        The CTLA4 extracellular domain can also recognize and bind
                                                     4

 WO 2014/004866                                                                  PCT/US2013/048247
CD80 and/or CD86. The extracellular domain may also include fragments or derivatives of CTLA4
that bind a binds CD80 and/or CD86.
[0024]       The CTLA4 molecule may be a fusion protein, where a fusion protein is defined as one or
more amino acid sequences joined together using methods well known in the art. The joined amino
acid sequences thereby form one fusion protein.         In some embodiments, the CTLA4 molecule
contains at least a portion of an immunoglobulin, such as the Fe portion of an immunoglobulin.        In
some embodiments, the CTLA4 molecule is an isolated and purified CTLA4 molecule.
[0025]       In some embodiments, the CTLA4 molecule is a protein containing at least a portion of
an immunoglobulin, such as the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin. In some embodiments, the CTLA4
molecule is an isolated and purified CTLA4 molecule.
[0026]            In some preferred embodiments, the CTLA4 molecule is abatacept. Abatacept is a
soluble fusion protein that consists of the extracellular domain of human CTLA-4 linked to the
modified Fe (hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains) portion of human immunoglobulin GI (IgGI).
Abatacept is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mrnammalian cell expression system. The
apparent molecular weight of abatacept is 92 kilodaltons.
[0027]           Abatacept was developed for use in adult rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic
arthritis and is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical response,
inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with
moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis.
[0028]       Abatacept was developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and is disclosed, for example, in U.S.
Pat. 5,851,795, U.S. Pat. 7,455,835, and U.S. Pat. Pub. 20011/311529. Abatacept, under the trade
name     ORENCIA,      may be    used   as monotherapy     or concomitantly with     disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) other than tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.           Abatacept is
also indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with
moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Abatacept may be used as
monotherapy or concomitantly with methotrexate (MTX). Since abatacept is a selective costimulation
modulator and inhibits the costimulation of T cells, it should not be administered concomitantly with
TNF antagonists.
[0029]       Abatacept selectively binds to CD80 and CD86, thereby blocking the interaction with
CD28 and interfering with T-cell activation. It inhibits naive T-cell activation, thus having the
potential   to   selectively  inhibit  T-cell response     to  specific antigens   instead   of   broad
immunosuppression. Effector-memory T-cell responses are less dependent on CD28 co-stimulation
and, presumably, are less inhibited by co-stimulation blockade. (Lo DJ, Weaver TA, Stempora L, et
al. Am J Transplant2011; 11: 22--33.)

[0030]            Studies in both animals and human beings have shown that interruption of the co
stimulatory second signal beneficially affects autoimmunity. Co-stimulation blockade with abatacept
has been shown to have clinical effectiveness in psoriasis (Abrams JR, Lebwohl MG, Guzzo CA, et
al. J Clin Invest 1999; 103: 1243-52) and psoriatic arthritis ( lease P. Genovese MC, Gladstein G, et
al. Arthritis Rheum 2011; 63: 939-48) and is approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Genant
HK. Peterfy CG, Westhovens R, et al. Ann Rheum Dis 2008; 67: 1084-89) including juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis. (Ruperto N, Lovell DJ, Quartier P, et al             Lancet 2008; 372: 383-91.)
Additionally, co-stimulation blockade has been effective in control of allograft rejection. (Vincenti F,
Larsen C, Durrbach A. N Engl J Med 2005; 353: 770-81.)              Moreover, Lenschow and coworkers
(Lenschow DJ, Ho SC, Sattar H, et al. J Exp Med 1995; 181: 1145--55) showed that costimulatory
blockade with both an anti B7-2 monoclonal antibody and a CTLA4-immunoglobulin fusion protein
prevented diabetes in the NOD mice model when administered prior to 10 weeks of age.
[0031]             It has now been shown that co-stimulation modulation with T-cell co-stimulatory
antagonists such as CTLA-4 compositions and in particular abatacept, halts or slows autoimmune           p
cell destruction leading to preservation of C-peptide secretion in recently diagnosed patients with
Type I diabetes by blocking the generation of autoaggressive T cells (Orban et al., Lancet 2011; 378
(9789): 412-9.)
[0032]       There are many autoantigens considered to be important in human Type 1 diabetes
mellitus. Several data suggest that insulin is a major antigen playing roles in the pathogenesis of the
disease (Muir et al. (1993) Diabetes Metab. Rev 9:279-287). Insulin, a     p-cell specific major protein is
moderately immunogenic when used alone, and has been shown in a pilot human trial to have the
effect of delaying the development of diabetes mellitus (Keller et al. (1993) Lancet 341:927-928).
However, it must be injected daily over long periods of time to induce the desired effect. When
insulin is used in humans, there is always a major concern about hypoglycemia and its sequels.
[0033]        Immunogenic fragments or variants of insulin or preproinsulin lacking hypoglycemic
effect are a safe choice for human use. For example, insulin B-chain (or immunogenic fragments and
variants thereof without metabolic effect) can be used as an immune modulator to prevent or delay
further loss of functional, residual D-cell mass, after the clinical onset of Type I diabetes in humans,
without hypoglycemic effect. The reintroduction of autoantigen, e.g., insulin B-chain, in human
subjects can act to change to autoimmune process triggering a protective immune response. The
Thl/Th2 balance can change in favor of a protective Th2 type cell response and generation of
regulatory immune cells, Tregs.
[0034]       Autoantibodies against insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and other islet cell
autoantigens, e.g., ICA 512/IA-2 protein tyrosine phosphatase, ICA12, ICA69, are frequently found in
newly diagnosed diabetic patients. Thus, Type      1 diabetes autoantigens useful in the methods of the

 WO 2014/004866                                                                       PCT/US2013/048247
invention    include,  e.g.,  preproinsulin    or an   immunologically   active   fragment thereof (e.g.,
preproinsulin fragment, insulin B-chain, A chain, C peptide or an immunologically active fragment
thereof), and other islet cell autoantigens (ICA), e.g., GAD65, islet tyrosine phosphatase ICA512/IA
2, ICA12, ICA69 or immunologically active fragments thereof. Other Type 1 diabetes autoantigens
include    HSP60,     carboxypeptidase      H,   peripherin, gangliosides    (e.g.,   GM1-2,   GM3)     or
immunologically active fragments thereof. Any of the Type I diabetes autoantigens described herein,
or immunologically active fragments, analogs or derivatives thereof, are useful in the methods and
compositions of the invention.
[0035]        The insulin mRNA is translated as a 110 amino acid single chain precursor called
preproinsulin, and removal of its signal peptide during insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum
generates proinsulin. Proinsulin consists of three domains: an amino-terminal B-chain, a carboxy
terminal A chain and a connecting peptide in the middle known as the C peptide. Within the
endoplasmic reticulum, proinsulin is exposed to several specific endopeptidases which excise the C
peptide, thereby generating the mature form of insulin which consists of the A and B-chain. Insulin
and free C peptide are packaged in the Golgi into secretory granules which accumulate in the
cytoplasm. The preproinsulin peptide sequence is found in SEQ ID NO: 1.
[0036]        Insulin A chain includes amino acids 90-110 of SEQ ID NO: 1, B-chain includes amino
acids 25-54 of SEQ ID NO: 1. The connecting sequence (amino acids 55-89 of SEQ ID NO: 1)
includes a pair of basic amino acids at either end. Proteolytic cleavage of proinsulin at these dibasic
sequences liberates the insulin molecule and free C peptide, which includes amino acids 57-87 of
SEQ ID NO:1. The human preproinsulin or an immunologically active fragment thereof, e.g., B-chain
or an immunogenic fragment thereof, e.g., amino acids 33-47 of SEQ ID NO:1 (corresponding to
residues 9-23 of the B-chain) or signal peptide sequence or other sequences of the preproinsulin, are
useful as autoantigens in the methods and compositions described herein.
[0037]        Gad65 is a primary f-cell antigen involved in the autoimmune response leading to insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus (Christgau et al. (1991) J Biol. Chem. 266(31):21257-64). The presence
of autoantibodies to GAD65 is used as a method of diagnosis of Type I diabetes. Gad65 is the 585
amino acid protein of SEQ ID NO:2.           Changes in autoantibody titers and in GAD65AB isotypes
reflecting the effect of administration can be used to characterize the regression in autoimmune
process in diabetic or prediabetic patients. In addition, there will be changes in stimulated cytokine
profile (in favor of Th2-cells) correlating with the effect of the autoantigen administration, which later
may be used as humoral marker for regression of autoimmunity in Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
[0038]        IA-2/ICA512, a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family, is another major
autoantigen in Type I diabetes (Lan et al. DNA Cell Biol 13:505-514, 1994). 70% of diabetic patients
have autoantibodies to IA-2, which appear years before the development of clinical disease. The IA-2

transmembrane, and extracellular domain (Rabin et al. (1994) J. Immunol. 152 (6), 3183-3188).
Autoantibodies are typically directed to the intracellular domain, e.g., amino acids 600-979 of SEQ ID
NO:3 and fragments thereof (Zhang et al. (1997) Diabetes 46:40-43; Xie et al. (1997) J Immunol
159:3662-3667). The amino acid sequence of IA-2 is shown in SEQ ID NO: 3.
[0039]        ICA 12 (Kasimiotis et al. (2000) Diabetes 49(4):555-61; Gen bank Accession No.
AAD16237; SEQ ID NO:4) is one of a number of islet cell autoantigens associated with diabetes. The
sequence of ICA12 is provided as SEQ ID NO: 4.
[0040]        ICA69 is another autoantigen associated with Type I diabetes (Pietropaolo et al. J Clin
Invest 1993; 92:359-371). The amino acid sequence of ICA69 is provided as SEQ 1D NO: 5.
[0041]        Glima   38 is a 38 kDa        islet cell membrane     autoantigen which     is specifically
immunoprecipitated with sera from a subset of prediabetic individuals and newly diagnosed Type I
diabetic patients. Glima 38 is an amphiphilic membrane glycoprotein, specifically expressed in islet
and neuronal cell lines, and thus shares the neuroendocrine expression patterns of GAD65 and IA2
(Aanstoot et al. J Clin Invest. June 15, 1996 ;97(12):2772-2783).
[0042]        HSP60, e.g., an immunologically active fragment of HSP60, e.g., p277 (see Elias et al.,
Eur J Immunol 1995 25(10):2851-7), can also be used as an autoantigen in the methods and
compositions described herein. Other useful epitopes of HSP 60 are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No.
6,110,746.
[0043]        Carboxypeptidase H has been identified as an autoantigen, e.g., in pre-Type I diabetes
patients (Castano et al. (1991) J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 73(6):1197-201; Alcalde et al. J Autoimmun.
August 1996;9(4):525-8.). Therefore, carboxypeptidase H or immunologically reactive fragments
thereof (e.g., the 136-amino acid fragment of carboxypeptidase-H described in Castano, supra) can be
used in the methods and compositions described herein.
[0044]        Peripherin is a 58 KDa diabetes autoantigen identified in nod mice (Boitard et al. (1992)
Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89(1):172-6. The human peripherin sequence is shown as SEQ ID NO:6.
[0045]        Gangliosides can also be useful autoantigens in the methods and compositions described
herein. Gangliosides are sialic acid-containing glycolipids which are formed by a hydrophobic
portion, the ceramide, and a hydrophilic part, i.e. the oligosaccharide chain. Gangliosides are
expressed, inter alia, in cytosol membranes of secretory granules of pancreatic islets. Auto-antibodies
to gangliosides have been described in Type I diabetes, e.g., GM 1-2 ganglioside is an islet
autoantigen in diabetes autoimmunity and is expressed by human native      P cells (Dotta et al. Diabetes.
September 1996;45(9):1193-6). Gangliosides GT3, GD3 and GM-I                   are also the target of
autoantibodies associated with autoimmune diabetes (reviewed in Dionisi et al. Ann Ist Super Sanita
                                                    8

 WO 2014/004866                                                                    PCT/US2013/048247
1997;33(3):433-5). Ganglioside GM3 participates in the pathological conditions of insulin resistance
(Tagami et al. J Biol Chem Nov. 13, 2001; online publication ahead of print).
[0046]        Insulin B-chain is a preferred diabetes autoantigen.   Human insulin B-chain for human
vaccine use can be made by a standard solid-phase peptide synthesis.           A procedure for effective
solubilization of the insulin  p-chain is described herein.   In some embodiments, the autoantigen is
human insulin B-chain (amino acids 25-54 of SEQ ID NO:1) or an immunologically active fragment,
or variant thereof. In some embodiments, the B-chain or fragment thereof is not recombinant. For
example, the B-chain or immunogenic fragment or variant thereof is a synthetic peptide, e.g., the B
chain is made by solid-phase synthesis. In some preferred embodiments, the B-chain is solubilized in
urea.    In some embodiments, the human insulin B-chain is denatured, e.g., solubilized in urea and
DTT. In a preferred embodiment, the human insulin B-chain is between 30-70%, preferably between
40-60%, more preferably between 45-55% proportion weight by weight (w/w).
[0047]       Thus, there is provided herein a method of treating, preventing, or delaying the
progression of diabetes mellitus by administering     CTLA4 and a Type I diabetes autoantigen.        The
two components may be administered simultaneously, sequentially, or with a separate time course
(e.g., one in the morning and the other in the evening or in other different time courses related to each
other).
[0048]       The onset of TI DM may be delayed by the methods as described herein such that insulin
is not needed by the subject for a longer length of time.      Alternatively or in addition, the present
method may extend the "honeymoon phase" in an already diabetic subject The honeymoon phase is
where insulin is secreted by die pancreas, causing high blood sugar levels to subside, and resulting in
normal or near normal glucose levels due to responses to insulin injections and treatment.
[0049]       TIDM may be prevented in a subject by first selecting a subject who is susceptible to
developing diabetes and administering a CTLA4 molecule and a Type I diabetes autoantigen as
described herein.     The subject who is susceptible to developing diabetes may be selected by the
expression of one or more of: GAD65 autoantibodies (GAAs), ICA512 autoantibodies (ICA512AAs),
or anti-insulin autoantibodies (IAAs).      Each of these autoantibodies is associated with a risk of
progression to autoimmune Type I diabetes. Expression of two or more of: GAD65 autoantibodies
(GAAs), ICA512 autoantibodies (ICA512AAs), or anti-insulin autoantibodies (IAAs) is associated
with a high risk of progression to autoimmune Type I diabetes. (Liping Yu et al., Diabetes August
2001 vol. 50 no. 8 1735-1740; Verge CF et al., Diabetes 45:926-933, 199; Verge CF. et al, Diabetes
47:1857--1866, 1998; and Bingley PJ, et al., Diabetes 43:1304-1310, 1994).
[0050]       TIDM may also be treated by the methods as described herein.           The treatment is for
subjects with residual beta-cell function or those no longer having any beta-cell function.           The
treatment may also be suggested for subjects provided exogenous beta-cells through transplant or
                                                    9

injection or other beta cell replacement modalities (like embryonic or other stem cell therapies or
other replacement modalities).
 [0051]       The combination of a CTLA4 molecule and the TIDM autoantigen as described herein
may be administered as part of one or more pharmaceutical compositions.            The methods of the
invention can prevent diabetes mellitus, or prevent or delay loss of residual @-cell mass, providing a
longer remission period reducing short term complications and/or delaying the onset of diabetes
related complications at a later stage of the life.
 [0052]       The CTLA4      molecule and TIDM        autoantigen may be combined into a single
pharmaceutical composition. Alternatively, the CTLA4 molecule is provided in one pharmaceutical
composition and the T1DM autoantigen is provided in a separate pharmaceutical compositions. In
this alternative, the two pharmaceutical compositions may have the same or different modes of
administration and time course of administration.
 [0053]       The pharmaceutical composition as provided herewith may include a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier.    The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any and all solvents,
diluents, or other liquid vehicle, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents,
thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the
particular dosage form desired. Reminngton's Pharm aceutica I-Sciences, Sixteenth Edition, E. W.
Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980) discloses various carriers used in formulating
pharmaceutical compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any
conventional carrier medium is incompatible with the compounds of provided herein, such as by
producing any undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any
other component(s) of the pharmaceutical composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope
of this invention. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers
 include, but are not limited to, sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn
starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl
cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatine; talc; excipients such as cocoa
butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil, sesame oil; olive
oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such as propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl
 laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid;
pyrogenfree water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as
well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate,
as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming
agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the
judgment of the formulator.

[0054]           The compounds described herein including pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can
be delivered to a patient using a wide variety of routes or modes of administration. Suitable routes of
administration include, but are not limited to, inhalation, transdermal, oral, rectal, transmucosal,
intestinal and parenteral administration, including intramuscular, subcutaneous and intravenous
injections.
[0055]           The compositions as described herein may be administered with an adjuvant.         The
term "adjuvant" can be a compound that lacks significant activity administered alone but can
potentiate the activity of another therapeutic agent. In some embodiments, an adjuvant is selected
from the group consisting of buffers, anti-microbial preserving agents, surfactants, antioxidants, tonic
regulators, antiseptics, thickeners and viscosity improvers. In some embodiments, the adjuvant is IFA
or other oil based adjuvant is present between 30-70%, preferably between 40-60%, more preferably
between 45-55% proportion weight by weight (w/w).         In some embodiments, human insulin B-chain
and IFA or other oil based adjuvant are present in about a 50/50 weight by weight ratio. In some
embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is free of contaminants, e.g., pyrogens.
[0056]            In some embodiments, the autoantigen is lyophilized. In another aspect, the invention
provides a pharmaceutical composition containing TI DM autoantigen that is made by the method of:
combining TIDM autoantigen and an oil-based carrier, e.g., an oil-based adjuvant, e.g., IFA, or other
oil based adjuvant, e.g., Montanide ISA (e.g., Montanide ISA51), and emulsifying the insulin B-chain
and oil-based adjuvant. In some embodiments, the TIDM autoantigen is human insulin B-chain or
preproinsulin or an immunologically active fragment or variant thereof which is combined with an
oil-based carrier where the insulin B-chain and oil-based adjuvant are emulsified. In a preferred
embodiment, human insulin      D-chain and oil-based adjuvant are combined in a weight by weight ratio
(w/w) of between 30/70 to 70/30, preferably between 40/60 to 60/40, preferably between 45/55 to
55/45, more preferably about a 50/50 w/w ratio. In a preferred embodiment, emulsification is
performed with a high pressure syringe. In preferred embodiments, the oil-based carrier or adjuvant,
and preferably the composition, does not include a bacterial component, e.g., a mycobacterial
component.
[0057]            In some embodiments, the TIDM autoantigen is a            B-chain or preproinsulin or
immunogenically active fragment or variant thereof and        is solubilized in about 3 M to 8 M urea,
preferably in about 3.5 M to 7 M urea, or about 4 M to 6 M urea. In a preferred embodiment, the B
chain or immunogenically active fragment or variant thereof is solubilized in about 3 M to 5 M urea,
preferably in about 3.5 M to 4.5 M urea, most preferably in about 4 M urea.              In a preferred
embodiment, the [p-chain or immunogenically active fragment or variant thereof is solubilized in 5 -8
M urea, preferably in about 6 M to 7 M urea. Preferably, the B-chain is solubilized in the presence of
                                                    11

a reducing agent, e.g., DTT or an equivalent reducing agent, e.g., I to 5 mg of DTT is added during
the solubilization step.
[0058]            In some embodiments, the composition comprising a Type I diabetes autoantigen
and/or CTLA4 molecule also includes an oil-based carrier.
[0059]           The oil-based carrier is a composition that includes at least 10% by weight of a
natural or synthetic oil suitable for administration to a human in conjunction with a therapeutic agent
is one preferred embodiment. In preferred embodiments, the carrier includes at least 20, 30, 50, 70,
80, 90, 95, 98, or 99% oil by weight. In some embodiments, the oil-based carrier can include less than
70, 60, 50, 40, 30 or 20% oil by weight. In preferred embodiments, the oil will be in the range of 10 to
95%, preferably 20 to 90% or 30 to 70% oil by weight. The oil should be chosen such that it provides
for sustained release of a substance dispersed within it when administered to a subject. Suitable oils
include mineral oil (e.g., Drakeol 6 VR light mineral oil), vegetable oil, squalene, or liquid paraffin. In
some embodiments, the oil-based carrier can contain more than one type of oil. In some embodiments,
the oil-based carrier can include an immune stimulator, e.g,, an immunostimulating glucan, but it is
much    preferred that the oil-based carrier does not include an immune stimulator, e.g., an
immunostimulating glucan, a bacterial component, e.g., a mycobacterial component. In a preferred
embodiment, the oil-based carrier does not include an alum component.
[0060]            While not wanting to be bound by theory, an oil based carrier is believed to work by
triggering the immunocompetent cells, which are related to the inflammatory and protective immune
response ability. An oil-based carrier can also act as an antigen vehicle and a slow release or long
term antigen presentation device. When injected into a subject, an oil-based carrier and antigen
composition can form a depot of antigen at the injection site, thereby protecting the antigen from
degradation. From this depot the antigen can be released slowly into the system and provides a
prolonged antigen presentation as well as expanded total contact surface area and the attraction of
inflammatory cells. Macrophages can digest most of the incorporated materials and present the
processed antigens on their surface. From this depot the antigen can be released slowly into the
system and provides a prolonged antigen supply to act as costimulatory modulator.
[0061]           Oil based carriers optionally include an emulsifier or surfactant component. The
emulsifier or surfactant (and the amount of emulsifier or suirfactant) is chosen such that it facilitates
the mixture or dispersion of a substance, e.g., an antigen preparation, with the oil. An oil-based carrier
can include 0.1 to 50%, preferably I to 30%, more preferably 5 to 20% by weight of a surfactant or
emulsifier. Examples of emulsifiers or surfactants include Arlacel A, mannide oleate (e.g., Montanide
80-mannide monooleate), anhydrous mannitol/oleic acid ester, polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene.
[0062]             Incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA)       is a preferred    delivery   vehicle for the
autoantigen in humans. The methods of the invention can prevent diabetes mellitus, or prevent or

delay loss of residual   p-cell mass, providing a longer remission period and delaying the onset of
diabetes related, usually progressive, complications at a later stage of the life.
[0063]            An oil-based carrier or adjuvant typically consists of two components: (1) an oil, and
(2) an emulsifier or surfactant, mixed with water. Suitable oils and emulsifiers are known in the art.
For example, the oil can be mineral oil, vegetable oil, squalene or liquid paraffin. The emulsifier or
surfactant   can   be,  e.g.,  Arlacel  A,   mannide   oleate,   anhydrous     mannitol/oleic acid   ester,
polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene. Exemplary oil-based adjuvants include conventional IFA,
Montanide ISA adjuvants, or Hunter's TiterMax adjuvant. In preferred embodiments, the adjuvant
includes 20 to 95%, preferably 30 to 90%, more preferably 40 to 70% by weight of an oil phase, and
0.1 to 50%, preferably I to 30%, more preferably 5 to 20% by weight of a surfactant or emulsifier.
Various types of oil-based adjuvants are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,814,321, U.S. Pat. No.
6,299,884, U.S. Pat. No. 6,235,282, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,976,538.
[0064]             IFA is typically a mixture of a non-metabolizable oil (e.g., mineral oil), water, and a
surfactant (e.g., Arlacel A). Unlike Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA), IFA does not contain a
bacterial component, e.g., mycobacteria. The first large-scale vaccinations using IFA in humans took
place on US military personnel (Davenport (1968) Ann Allergy 26:288-292; Beebe et al., (1972) Am
J Epidemiol 95:337-346; Salk & Salk (1977) Science 195:834-847). The findings were essentially
negative with respect to malignancy, allergic diseases and collagenosis, but there was evidence that
some men had a cyst like reaction at the site of inoculation. Later studies confirmed that these side
effects were due to incorrect administration i.e. they were given erroneously s.c. instead of i.m. From
these experiments, IFA was regarded by some as unsuitable for human purposes, although it has
remained widely used in animal research. In recent years, newer forms of IFA have been shown safe
for human use in HIV immunotherapy or therapeutic vaccinations (Turner et al. (1994) AIDS 8:1429
1435; Trauger et al. (1995) J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol 10 Supp2:S74-82; Trauger
et al. (1994) J Infect Dis 169:1256-1264).
[0065]            Montanide ISA Adjuvants (Seppic, Paris, France) are a group of oil/surfactant based
adjuvants in which different surfactants are combined with either a non-metabolizable mineral oil, a
metabolizable oil, or a mixture of the two. They are prepared for use as an emulsion with aqueous Ag
solution. The surfactant for Montanide ISA 50 (ISA--lncomplete Seppic Adjuvant) is mannide oleate,
a major component of the surfactant in Freund's adjuvants. The surfactants of the Montanide group
undergo strict quality control to guard against contamination by any substances that could cause
excessive inflammation, as has been found for some lots of Arlacel A used in Freund's adjuvant. The
various Montanide ISA group of adjuvants are used as water-in-oil emulsions, oil-in-water emulsions,
or water-in-oil-in-water emulsions. The different adjuvants accommodate different aqueous phase/oil
phase ratios, because of the variety of surfactant and oil combinations.

 WO 2014/004866                                                                      PCT/US2013/048247
[0066]             Hunter's TiterMax (CytRx Corp., Norcross, Ga.) is an oil/surfactant-based adjuvant
prepared as a water-in-oil emulsion in a manner similar to that used for conventional Freund's
adjuvants. However, it uses a metabolizable oil (squalene) and a nonionic surfactant that has good
protein antigen-binding capacity as well as adjuvant activity. The adjuvant activity may relate, in part,
to the surfactant's ability to activate complement and bind complement components, as this helps
target the Ag to follicular dendritic cells in the spleen and lymph nodes. The surfactant used in the
commercially available adjuvant is one of a number of synthetic nonionic block copolymers of
polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene developed by Hunter (Hunter et al., 1991 Vaccine 9:250
256). The utilization of copolymer-coated microparticles to stabilize the emulsion permits formation
of stable emulsions with less than 20% oil, an important factor in minimizing total adjuvant injected.
[0067]           An adjuvant can be used with antigens to elicit cell-mediated immunity and the
production of antibodies of protective isotypes (IgG2a in mice and IgG I in primates). Different types
of adjuvants share similar side effects, such as a reaction at the injection site and pyrogenicity. Alum,
a commonly used adjuvant for human vaccine also produces an appreciable granulomatous response
at the injection site (Allison & Byars (1991) Mol Immunol 28:279-284). The mode of action of an
incomplete Freund's adjuvant can involve non-specific as well as specific immune responses. IFA
seems to work by triggering the immunocompetent cells, which are related to the inflammatory as
well as protective ability. IFA also acts as an antigen vehicle and a slow release or long-term antigen
presentation device. Injecting a patient with an IFA and antigen compound, it forms a depot of antigen
at the injection site, thereby protecting the antigen from degradation. From this depot the antigen is
released slowly into the system and provides a prolonged antigen presentation as well as expanded
total contact surface area and the attraction of inflammatory cells. Macrophages digest most of the
incorporated materials and present the processed antigens on their surface.
[0068]           The specific enhancing effect of the IFA on the antigen immunogenicity has been
found to lead to increased humoral immunity (preferentially protective antibody production; IgG1 in
humans and IgG2a in mice) and to elicit specific cell mediated immunity (preferentially Th2 type and
Tregs). Specifically, human recombinant insulin B-chain in IFA results in Th2 cytokine pattern in
NOD mice islets (Ramiya et al. (1996) J Autoimmun 9:349-356). IFA is unique among adjuvants tried
for diabetes prevention in animal models. Ramiya and coworkers (supra) concluded that both alum
and DPT as adjuvants have 'non-specific' protective effects unrelated to the antigen used, while IFA
is the only one with antigen specific protective effect for diabetes prevention in animals.
[0069]            IFA, preferably an IFA approved for human use, e.g., Montanide (e.g., Montanide
ISA51, Seppic Inc., France) or an equivalent composition, is a preferred adjuvant for use in thc
methods and vaccines described herein. Montanide ISA51 has shown no systemic or significant local
side effects in our animal and in our human studies.

[0070]            For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated readily by combining the
active compound(s) with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers

Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained solid excipient, optionally grinding a

wheat     starch,   rice   starch,  potato   starch,   gelatin,  gum      tragacanth,    methyl    cellulose,
hydroxypropylmethyl-cellu lose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).
If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or
alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate.
[0071]            The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g.. by
bolus injection or continuous infusion. injection (intravenous or subcutaneous) is a preferred method
of administration for the compositions of the current invention. Formulations for injection may be
presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added
preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or
aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or
dispersing agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid
or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate.
[0072]             In some embodiments, the combination as described herein may be administered
parenterally, by injection subcutaneously, or intramuscularly. In some embodiments, a              preferred
mode of administration is intramuscularly. For example, the Type I diabetes autoantigen as described
herein can be given as an intramuscular injection, preferably a deep intramuscular injection, in a small
volume, e.g., I ml. The autoantigen can be administered once, or more than once. It can be given, for
example, before, or after the onset of Type I diabetes mellitus.
[0073]            The dosage may also depend on the route of administration and will vary according to
the size of the host. For example, 2 mg of human insulin B chain solution can be administered to an
adult human. The concentration of the active ingredient protein in an immunogenic composition
according to the invention is in general about I to 95%.
[0074]            A vaccine can also contain an adjuvant, e.g., an oil based adjuvant, e.g., IFA.
Preferably, the vaccine contains an IFA suitable and approved for human use, e.g., Montanide ISA 51
or an equivalent composition.
[0075]            The vaccines are prepared under conditions suitable for human administration.
Preferably, the vaccine injection is prepared as an emulsion immediately before administration, under
                                                     15

 WO 2014/004866                                                                       PCT/US2013/048247

chain/IFA.
[0076]            The methods and vaccines described herein can be used to prevent the onset of an
autoimmune disease, e.g., diabetes mellitus. The methods and vaccines can also be used to arrest the
autoimmune destruction of tissue, e.g., pancreatic     B-  cells. The methods and vaccines are useful to
arrest the autoimmune destruction, even at a late stage. For example, at the time of clinical onset of
type  1 diabetes mellitus, significant number of insulin producing p-cells are destroyed but around 15%
maybe as much as 40% are still capable of insulin production. If the autoimmune process can be
arrested even in this late stage, these cells can be preserved. The  s-cells have some limited capacity to
replicate and precursors may form new     p-cells.
[0077]            Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions
of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds
may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles
include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides,
or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances, which increase the viscosity of
the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl            cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the
suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents, which increase the solubility of the
compounds to allow for the preparation of highly, concentrated solutions. For injection, the agents of
the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible
buffers such as Hanks's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer.      Alternatively, the
active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen
free water, before use.
[0078]            The amount of the combination of a CTLA4 molecule and insulin         p-chain provided to
the subject will depend on both the size and weight of the subject as well as the progression of the
disease. For the compounds described herein, the therapeutically effective amount can be initially
determined from in vitro assays.       Since the compounds of the present invention may have a low
absorption and low bioavailability, the therapeutically effective amount may be determined from, for
example, fecal concentration of the compounds or metabolites thereof or biomarkers from the blood.
As is well known in the art, therapeutically effective amounts for use in humans can also be
determined from animal models.          A therapeutically effective dose can also be determined from
human data for compounds which are known to exhibit similar pharmacological activities. The
applied dose can be adjusted based on the relative potency of the administered compound as
compared with the known compound.
[0079]            Patient doses for parenteral administration of the compounds described herein,
typically range from about I mg/day to about 10,000 mg/day, more typically from about 10 mg/day to

 WO 2014/004866                                                                     PCT/US2013/048247
about 1,000 ma/day or from about 250 mg/day to about 2,000 mg/day, and most typically from about
50 mg/day to about 500 mg/day or from about 0.5 mg/day to about 10 mg/day.             Stated in terms of
patient body weight, typical dosages range from about 0.01 to about 150 mg/kg/day, more typically
from about 0.1 to about 15 mg/kg/day, and most typically from about I to about 10 mg/kg/day, for
example 5 mg/kg/day or 3 mg/kg/day.
[0080]        Both the CTLA4 molecule and the insulin B-chain may be administered in a single dose
or they may be administered separately, where separate administration contemplates administration at
near the same time or administration at different times, such as one in the morning and the other in the
evening, or one twice a day and the other once a day.    The two drugs may be given simultaneously or
in different order, i.e. CTLA4-Ig first followed by insulin B-chain in IFA or insulin B-chain and then
CTLA4-Ig at different timepoints.
[0081]        The dosing may be over a period of time, such as once a month, or every 28 days.           In
some embodiments, additional doses (e.g., bolus dosing) may be given at the beginning of treatment.
In some embodiments, a dose containing approximately 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 mg/kg of the
fusion protein. In some embodiments, a dose containing approximately 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
100, 500 microg/kg of the diabetes autoantigen.
[0082]            The definitions of terms used herein are meant to incorporate the present state-of-the
art definitions recognized     for each term in the chemical and pharmaceutical fields.            Where
appropriate, exemplification is provided.      The definitions apply to the terms as they are used
throughout this specification, unless otherwise limited in specific instances, either individually or as
part of a larger group.
[0083]            As used herein, the terms "administering" or "administration"          are intended to
encompass all means for directly and indirectly delivering a compound to its intended site of action.
[0084]            An "autoantigen" as used herein, is a protein that despite being a normal cell or tissue
constituent, can be the target of a humoral or cell-mediated immune response in a subject. For
example, diabetes Type I autoantigens are typically normal protein constituents of pancreatic cells.
An "immunologically active fragment" of an autoantigen described herein is an autoantigen in which
one or more amino acid residues have been deleted and the fragment retains the ability to react with
immune cells or with an autoantigen antibody or to stimulate the production of antibodies against the
autoantigen. For example, an immunologically active fragment can be an autoantigen polypeptide in
which residues have been successively deleted from the amino- and/or carboxyl-termini, while
substantially retaining immunogenic activity. For example, insulin B-chain (amino acids 25-54 of
SEQ ID NO: I) is an immunologically active fragment of preproinsulin; a polypeptide that includes
amino acids 33-47 of SEQ ID NO: I is an immunologically active fragment of B-chain; a polypeptide
that includes amino acids from about 600 to 979 of SEQ ID NO:3 includes an immunologically active
                                                    17

 WO 2014/004866                                                                     PCT/US2013/048247
fragment of IA-2. In a preferred embodiment, the immunologically active fragment is a fragment of
any of SEQ ID Nos: 1-6. Preferred fragments lacks one or more biological activities of the native
autoantigen, but retain the ability to react with an autoantigen antibody and immune cells. E.g., a
preferred insulin fragment or variant lacks a hypoglycemic effect. Preferably, an immunologically
active fragment of an autoantigen described herein is between 4 and 400 amino acid residues in
length, more preferably between 10 and 300 amino acid residues in length, more preferably between
30 and 200 amino acid residues in length.
[0085]            The phrase "delaying the progression" as used herein in the context of delaying the
progression of diabetes mellitus means that the loss of functional residual        p-cell mass, after the
clinical onset of Type I diabetes is delayed. The delayed progression of TI DM can be measured, for
example, by measuring C-peptide production.
[0086]            An "immunologically active variant" of an autoantigen described herein is an
autoantigen that has been modified by addition, modification or substitution of one or more amino
acid residues in the naturally occurring autoantigen and retains the ability to react with an autoantigen
antibody or to stimulate the production of antibodies against the autoantigen. The variants described
herein encompass allelic and polymorphic variants, and also muteins and fusion proteins that retain
the ability to bind an autoantigen antibody or to produce an immune response against the autoantigen
in a human. For example, up to 20%, preferably up to 10%, of the amino acid residues of an
autoantigen can be replaced with substitute amino acids, so long as the variant retains the ability to
bind autoantigen or produce an immune response against the autoantigen, e.g., in a human. A variant
can also include an autoantigen or fragment thereof described herein in which one or more amino
acids have been inserted or added, e.g., an autoantigen that has been coupled or fused to a carrier
peptide. Also included are variants containing modifications, such as incorporation of unnatural
amino acid residues, or phosphorylated, sulfonated, or biotinylated amino acid residues. Modifications
of amino acid residues may also include aliphatic esters or amides of the carboxyl terminus or of
residues containing carboxyl side chains, 0-acyl derivatives of hydroxyl group-containing residues,
and N-acvl derivatives of the amino-terminal amino acid or amino-group containing residues, e.g.,
lysine or arginine. Other modifications include the addition of other moieties, particularly those that
may increase the immunogenicity of the autoantigen. Preferred variants lack one or more biological
activities of the native autoantigen, but retain the ability to react with an autoantigen antibody or
immune cells. E.g., a preferred insulin variant lacks a hypoglycemic effect.
[0087]            The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to additives or compositions that are
physiologically tolerable and do not typically produce an allergic or similar untoward reaction, such
as gastric upset, dizziness and the like, when administered to an animal, such as a mammal (e.g., a
human). The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any and all solvents, diluents, or
other liquid vehicle, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening
                                                    18

or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the particular
dosage form desired. Remington's, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, (Gennaro, A. R., ed., 19t
edition, 1995, Mack Pub. Co.), discloses various carriers used in formulating pharmaceutical
compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional
carrier medium is incompatible with the compounds of provided herein, such as by producing any
undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other
component(s) of the pharmaceutical composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of this
 invention. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers
include, but are not limited to, sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn
starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl
cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatine; talc.   Excipients such as cocoa
 butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil, sesame oil; olive
oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such as propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl
laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid;
pyrogenfree water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as
well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate,
as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming
agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the
judgment of the formulator.
 [0088]           The term "pharmaceutical composition" refers to a composition described herein, or
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, with other agents such as carriers and/or excipients.
 Preferably, a pharmaceutical composition will have the active agent present at at least 95% purity, or
98% purity, or 99% purity, or more.
 [0089]           As used herein, the term "subject" is a human or other animal, having a diabetes, pre
diabetes, or a predisposition to diabetes. Thus, in some embodiments the subject will be in need of
the therapeutic treatment as provided herein.    Preferred patients are mammals. Examples of patients
include but are not limited to, humans, horses, monkeys, dogs, cats, mice, rates, cows, pigs, goats and
sheep.    In some embodiments, "subjects" are generally human patients having diabetes.         In some
embodiments, "subjects" are human patients who have been diagnosed with TIDM within the last
200, 100, or 50 days. In some embodiments, "subjects" are human patients who have been diagnosed
with diabetes mellitus but still have residual beta-cell function. In some such embodiments the
residual beta-cell function is detectable or at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, or more of the
beta cells in a fully functioning pancreas.
 [0090]           The term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages
and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired biological or medicinal response in a cell
culture, tissue system, animal, or human (e.g., the desired therapeutic result).      A therapeutically

effective amount of the composition may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex,
and weight of the individual, and the ability of the CTLA4 molecule and/or diabetes autoantigen to
elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any
toxic or detrimental effects of the pharmacological agent are outweighed by the therapeutically
beneficial effects.   In some embodiments, the response includes alleviation and/or delay of onset of
one or more symptoms of the disease, condition, or disorder being treated.
[0091]            The term "treatment" or "treating" as used herein is defined as the application or
administration of the therapeutic agents to a subject, or application or administration of the therapeutic
agents to an isolated tissue or cell line from a subject who has diabetes, a symptom of disease or a
predisposition toward a disease. Treatment is intended to encompass preventing the onset, slowing
the progression, reversing or otherwise ameliorating, improve, or affect the disease, the symptoms or
of disease or the predisposition toward disease. For example, treatment of a subject, e.g., a human
subject, with a composition described herein, can slow, improve, or stop the ongoing autoimmunity,
e.g., a reaction against pancreatic p-cells, in a subject before, during, or after the clinical onset of Type
I diabetes.
[00921            The term "about" or "approximately" means within an acceptable error range for the
particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, which will depend in part on how the
value is measured or determined-e.g.. the limitations of the measurement system, or the degree of
precision required for a particular purpose. For example, "about" can mean within I or within 2
standard deviations, as per the practice in the art. Alternatively, "about" can mean a range of up to
20%, preferably up to 10%, and more preferably up to 5%of a given value. Where particular values
are described in the application and claims, unless otherwise stated, the term "about" meaning within
an acceptable error range for the particular value should be assumed.
[0093]            As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the,"
include plural referents unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to
"a molecule" includes one or more of such molecules, "a resin" includes one or more of such different
resins and reference to "the method" includes reference to equivalent steps and methods known to
those of ordinary skill in the art that could be modified or substituted for the methods described
herein.
[0094]            While the above description provides examples and specific details of various
embodiments, it will be appreciated that some features and/or functions of the described embodiments
admit to modification without departing from the scope of the described embodiments. The above
description is intended to be illustrative of the invention, the scope of which is limited only by the
language of the claims appended hereto.

following examples, which should not be construed as limiting the scope of the applicant's teachings
in any way.
Example 1 - Administration of Abatacept
[0096]       Patients (aged 6-45 years) diagnosed with Type I diabetes within the past 100 days were
parallel-screened for this study. Patients were eligible to participate in the study if they had at least
one diabetes-related autoantibody (microassayed insulin antibodies [if duration of insulin therapy was
less than 7 days]; glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 [GAD-65] antibodies; islet-cell antigen-512 [ICA
512] antibodies; or islet-cell autoantibodies) and had stimulated C-peptide concentrations of 0-2
nmol/L or higher measured during a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) done at least 21 days after
diagnosis of diabetes and within 37 days of randomiization.
[0097]       People whose blood samples screened positive for serum antibodies to hepatitis B surface
antigen, hepatitis C, or HIV were excluded from participation. Samples were also tested for Epstein
Barr virus (EBV). Individuals who had evidence of active EBV infection at the time of screening were
ineligible, Participants who showed evidence of active EBV infection after randomization did not
receive additional study drug until resolution.
[0098]       Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio, stratified by participating site, to receive
experimental treatment with abatacept or placebo using a double blind protocol. Table 1 provides the

[00101]      Abatacept (Orencia, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ, USA) was given on days 1, 14,
and 28, and then every 28 days with the last dose on day 700 (total 27 doses) as a 30-min intravenous
infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg (maximum 1000 mg per dose) in a 100 mL 0-9% sodium chloride
infusion. Normal saline infusion was used as placebo. Patients did not receive any premedication.
[00102]      All patients received intensive diabetes management. The goal was to achieve intensive
glycaemic control as recommended by the American Diabetes Association. (American Diabetes
Association. Diabetes Care 2011; 33 (suppl 1): S11-61.)         Patients used either multiple daily insulin
injections or an insulin pump. Blood glucose monitoring was done by means of frequent daily blood
glucose monitoring. Use of non-insulin pharmaceuticals that affect glycaemic control was not
allowed.
[00103]      Blood samples were analyzed centrally. C-peptide concentrations were measured from
frozen plasma with a two-site immunoenzymometric assay (Tosoh Bioscience, South San Francisco,
CA, USA). Glycated haemoglobin Al c (HbAl c) was measured with ion-exchange high-performance
liquid chromatography (Variant II, Bio-Rad Diagnostics, Hercules, CA, USA). Reliability coefficients
for each assay were greater than 0-99 from split duplicate samples. Biochemical autoantibodies
(microassayed insulin antibodies, GAD-65 antibodies, ICA-512 antibodies) were measured with
radioimmunobinding assays and islet-cell autoantibodies (ICA) with indirect immunofluorescence. A
routine chemistry panel was done (Roche Diagnostics [Indianapolis, IN, USA] Hitachi 917 Analyzer
and reagents). HLA class II alleles were measured with PCR amplification and sequence-specific
hybridization.    -cell function was assessed by stimulated C-peptide secretion. The prespecified
primary outcome of this trial was a comparison of the area under the curve (AUC) of stimulated C
peptide response over the first 2 h of a 4-h MMTT2, done at the 24-month visit. The 4-h MMTTs

 WO 2014/004866                                                                       PCT/US2013/048247
were done at baseline and at 24 months; 2-h MMTTs were obtained at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months.
Patients who had completed their 2-year visit MMTT were included in the primary outcome
assessment. After completion of the 2-year treatment phase, participants entered a 2-year follow-up
phase to continue to assess safety and efficacy, including an MMTT every 6 months. Prespecified
secondary outcomes included: slope of C-peptide over time, difference between groups in incidence
of loss of peak C-peptide to less than 0-2 nmol/L, differences in HbAlc and insulin dose over time,
and safety. Prespecified subgroup factors included age, sex, race, baseline C-peptide, baseline insulin
use, baseline HbAl c, and HLA type.
[00104]       Spotfire S+ 8.1, a statistical analysis software, was used for all analyses. A sample size of
108 participants was planned to provide 85% power to detect a 50% increase in geometric mean C
peptide relative to the placebo group using a test at the 0-05 level (one-sided), with 10% loss to
follow-up and a 2:1 allocation to treatment versus control (based on an estimated mean of 0-248 and
SD of 0-179, on the transformed scale). All analyses were based on the prespecified intention to treat
cohort with known neasurements. Missing values were assumed to be missing at random. The p
values associated with the intention-to-treat treatment comparisons of the primary and secondary
endpoints are two-sided, although the design of the trial was based on a one-sided hypothesis test.
Interim analysis for endpoint treatment effect was done and reported to the data and safety monitoring
board once in accordance to the method of Lan and DeMets with O'Brien-Fleming boundaries. (Lan
KKG, DeMets DL. Bionietrika 1983; 70: 659-63.) The prespecified analysis method for C-peptide
mean AUC, HbAlc, and total daily insulin dose was an analysis of covariance model adjusting for
age, sex, and baseline value of the dependent variable, and treatment assignment. The predicted
means and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each treatment group were established at the
means of the other covariates. The significance levels associated with the treatment effect were from
the Wald test (from the fitted model). A normalizing transformation of log(XC---Pep + 1) was
prespecified for C-peptide AUC mean, and normal plots of the residuals suggested that it was
adequate. The C-peptide mean AUC equals the AUC divided by the 2-h interval (i.e., AUC/120). The
AUC was computed using the trapezoidal rule from the timed measurements of C-peptide during the
MMTT. The time to first stimulated peak C-peptide of less than 0-2 nmol/L (a level above which was
associated with decreased risk of complications in Diabetes Control and Complication Trial) was
analyzed with standard survival methods (Cox model and Kaplan-Meier method). Adverse event
grades were analyzed with the Wilcoxon rank sum test. (Agresti A. Categorical data analysis. New
York, NY, USA: John Wiley and Sons, 1990.) Mean rate of change of C-peptide mean AUC from 6
to 24 months was estimated with a mixed-effects model with both random intercept and slope
adjusting for age, sex, baseline C-peptide mean AUC, and treatment assignment.               The initial fit
included a fixed interaction effect of treatment and time, but was removed because of the absence of
any statistical evidence of it being other than zero. To assess the treatment effect over the entire time

period, we fitted a similar mixed model to the data with the differences that we defined time without
structure and grouped by 6-month intervals.
[00105]       Of the 112 patients enrolled in the study, 77 were randomly assigned to receive
experimental treatment with abatacept and 35 were assigned to receive placebo. Table 1 summarizes
the baseline characteristics of the two groups. The only noteworthy imbalances were the greater
proportion of men in the placebo group than in the abatacept group and higher mean HbAlc in the
placebo group. The number of infusions actually administered by treatment group were compared
using a Wilcoxon rank sum test; no significant difference was detected (p=0-61). Overall, 2514 (83%)
of 3024 potential infusions were given, and many that were not given were per protocol (e.g., patient
developed EBV infection or became pregnant). 689 (93%) of 738 expected MMTTs were done. In the
primary analysis at 2 years, participants assigned to abatacept had a geometric mean stimulated C
peptide 2-h AUC of 0-375 nmol/L (95% CI 0-290-0-465) versus 0-266 nmol/L (0-171-0-368) for
those assigned to placebo. The adjusted population C-peptide mean 2-h AUC at 2 years was 0-378
nmol/L for the abatacept group and 0-238 nmol/L for the placebo group; thus, C-peptide AUC at 2
years was 59% (95% CI 6-1-12) higher with abatacept (p=0-0029). The result remained unchanged
and significant (p=0-0028) when baseline HbA c was added as a covariate. To address the difference
in C-peptide concentrations from baseline to the 2-year assessments (primary endpoint), C-peptide
results for 3, 6, 12, and 18 months were separately modeled.
[00106]       FIG. I shows the adjusted population C-peptide mean 2-h AUC over 2 years. Patients
who received abatacept had a significantly higher mean AUC at 6, 12, and 18 months than did those
assigned to placebo, and over all time points in aggregate (p=0-0022). To calculate the effect of
treatment on delaying the reduction of C-peptide, we calculated the predicted population mean of C
peptide AUC mean by treatment group over time (FIG. 2). The lines are based on the fitting of a
mixed linear model using all available data from MMTTs at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. When testing
for the improvement in the fit for the interaction term of slope and treatment (i.e., testing the evidence
that the two treatment groups had differing C-peptide decay rates), this result was not significant
(p=0-85). Consequently, a simpler model assuming identical slopes was used and FIG. 2 shows these
results. Thus, estimated lag time in the means of the abatacept group to drop to the same level as those
of the placebo group was 9-6 months (95% Cl 3-47-15-6). By the 24-month assessment, (32%)
patients in the abatacept group had an AUC peak stimulated C-peptide less than 0-2 nmol/L,
compared with 15 (43%) patients on placebo (FIG. 3). The adjusted relative (abatacept to placebo
groups) risk of peak C-peptide falling below 0-2 nmol/L was 0-433 (95% Cl 0-218-0-861). During the
24 months of follow-up, the abatacept group had a lower adjusted mean HbA1c (FIG. 4) than did the
placebo group (for all time points in the aggregate, p=0-002), although HbAlc was also lower at
baseline. Nonetheless, even after adjustment for the difference at baseline, the treatment group
difference over 24 months persists (p-0-0071). At study end, 34 (47%) patients on abatacept had
                                                    24

HbAl c lower than 7% compared with eight (26%) on placebo. This is particularly noteworthy as 86%
of all patients were under 18 years of age; in this group this HbAlc is better that the ADA age
specific target HbAlc.       Participants in the abatacept group had lower insulin doses at some time
points (6 and 12 months) during the study, but at 24 months, insulin doses in the two groups were
similar (FIG. 4; p=NS at 24 months, but because of differences at the earlier time points, p=0-040 for
all time points in the aggregate).
[00107]        FIG. 5   shows the results of a homogeneity test of treatment effect on age, sex, race,
baseline C-peptide, baseline insulin use, baseline HbAl c, and HLA type. The apparent adverse effect
of abatacept in non-white participants might be hypothesis- generating, however the groups size was
small.
[00108]        Table 2 and Table 3 summarize safety and adverse events. Abatacept was well tolerated.
Infusion-related adverse events occurred with low frequency (47 of 2514 infusions [2%] involving 27
patients) and were not clinically significant. Of these, 36 reactions occurred in 17 (22%) of 77 patients
on abatacept and 11 reactions in six (17%) of 35 patients on placebo (p=0-62 for proportion of
participants by Fisher's exact test). Overall adverse event rate (including laboratory abnormalities)
was low with no difference between the two groups. Specifically, there was no increase in infection
(including EBV) or in neutropenia (which occurred in seven [9%] of patients on abatacept, five [14%]
on placebo). There were seven episodes of hypoglycemia reported as an adverse event, two of which
were severe hypoglycemia (one in each group).

[00111]       Results show that over 2 years co-stimulation modulation with abatacept slows the
reduction in  B-cell function in recent-onset Type I diabetes by 9-6 months. The early beneficial effect
suggests that T-cell activation still occurs around the time of clinical diagnosis of Type I diabetes,
even though the disease course has presumably been in progress for several years. However, despite
continued administration of abatacept over 24 months, the fall in         D-cell function in the abatacept
group parallels that in the placebo group on the basis of the mixed-model results that included the
time interval from 6 to 24 months. This subsequent reduction in      p-cell function causes us to speculate
that continuing T-cell      activation   subsides as the clinical     course of the disease progresses.
Nevertheless, the difference from the placebo group is maintained during drug administration. Further
observation will establish whether the beneficial effect continues after cessation of monthly abatacept
infusions. Follow up of these patient shows that the drug beneficial effect lasts beyond the drug
administration for at least one year.
[00112]      Abatacept was well tolerated, with no difference between the two groups in adverse

within 3 months of abatacept treatment. This factor might be important in view of the young age of
the target population. The main effect seems to occur early after initiation of treatment with
subsequent resumption of the fall in     p-cell function. This pattern is reminiscent of the effects of anti
CD3, anti-CD20, and a GAD-65 vaccine, all of which showed some efficacy followed later by a
reduction in    -cell function parallel to that in the control group. However this approach stands out as
this has little or no appreciable side effects unlike the other interventions enlisted. This finding is
consistent with our notion that there is an early window of opportunity after diagnosis in which T-cell
activation is prominent. The 59% higher mean AUC C-peptide with abatacept than with placebo at 24
months in our study is similar to that seen with those other interventions, although direct comparison
of studies is difficult because of differences in imporLant baseline characteristics, including age,
disease duration at time of randomization, and baseline HbAlc. Moreover, our study differs from
those studies in that abatacept was administered continuously throughout the study, whereas in the
case of anti-CD3, anti-CD20, and GAD-65 vaccine, administration of drug was completed within 2-4
weeks after randomization. Crucially, our study was not designed to establish whether a short
treatment protocol would be sufficient to maintain improved C-peptide secretion over 2 years or
whether a continuation of treatment is needed beyond 2 years. With all patients having completed
their course of abatacept, the ongoing follow-up phase of the study will investigate whether the
improved C-peptide secretion is sustained after discontinuation of the drug and for how long. Long
term follow-up of patients in one anti-CD3 trial showed diminishing difference in C-peptide secretion
between the treated and the placebo group after 3 years. This is not the case for abatacept as the data
one year off treatment shows that the beneficial effect is maintained, the difference in C-peptide
preservation between the abatacept treated and the placebo group has not diminished (the abatacept
group has 62% more C-peptide than the placebo group at 3 years).
[00 113]      In the abatacept group, mean HbA I c was lower than that in the placebo group throughout
the trial, although it was also lower at baseline. The maintenance of HbAlc lower than 7% for 18
months in the abatacept-treated group is noteworthy because 96 (86%) study participants were 18
years or younger. The clinical importance of HbAlc at this level has been well documented. (The
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group. N Engl. J Med 1993; 329: 977-86.)
Insulin use was similar in the two groups and thus did not contribute to the difference in HbAlc. In
our trial, abatacept-treated patients with recent-onset Type I diabetes had more endogenous insulin
production, measured by C-peptide, during the 2 years of study drug administration. The duration of
these effects after discontinuation of abatacept is being tested in ongoing follow-up of these patients.
The one-year-off-therapy data shows that the beneficial effects of abatacept persist at least for one
year beyond drug administration, including significantly better HbAlc at 3 years in the abatacept
group. The patients are being followed further. Abatacept administered over 2 years showed an
excellent safety profile in patients with Type I diabetes. Its main effect seems to occur early after the

this drug can be effective in slowing down the autoimmunity. These approaches might be more easily
tested with a subcutaneous version of abatacept.
Example 2 - Preparation of Insulin B-chain
[00114]           Human     insulin was made    by standard    solid-phase  peptide   synthesis (SPPS)
procedure, described herein and in U.S. Pat, Pub. 2006/0183670, herein incorporated by reference.
The assembly strategy used in the protein synthesis was ABI (Applied Biosystem Inc.)-Fmoc/Thr.
The Fmoc group protects the a-amino group of the amino acid. The peptide was assembled from the
C-terminal towards the N-terminal with the a-carboxyl group of the starting amino acid attached to a
solid support (resin). The resin used for assembly was polystyrene bead, an insoluble support with
size of 400-1000 micron in diameter swelled after washing with NMP (N-methylpyrrolidone). The
resin was preloaded with the first amino acid (Thr) from the C-terminal.
[00115]           The two steps were chain assembly and purification under sterile conditions.
[00116]           The first step in chain assembly is deprotection, or removal of the protecting group
The Fmoc protecting group is removed by 22% piperidine. Conductimetric feedback of carbamate salt
formed via removal of Fmoc group with piperidine/NMP showed the coupling efficacy.                After
deprotection, the next amino acid is activated and coupled to the deprotected amino end of the
growing peptide and forms the peptide bond. Activation of the incoming amino acid carboxyl group
was achieved by HBTU/HOBt.          Between couplings, the column was washed with methanol and NMP
(N-methylpyrrolidone), which swells the resin and washes out residues.
[00117]           The cycle was repeated until a peptide of desired length was achieved. A wash step
was performed with DCM (dichloromethane), which removes NMP from the resin, followed by
thorough washing with highly volatile methanol, an easily removable solvent which evaporates and
dries.
[00118]           Cleavage from the resin and removal of side-chain protecting groups.      A cleavage
mixture was prepared (0.75 g crystalline phenol+0.25 g ethanedithiol+0.5 ml thioanisol+0.5 ml
deionized H 2 0+10 ml trifluoroacetic acid). The dried peptide-resin was incubated in cool flask in ice
bath (10 ml mixture /100-150 mg peptide-resin) for 1.5 h. Then the peptide was isolated from the
reaction mixture by glass funnel filtration under high vacuum. The peptide was precipitated with cold
methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE) and vacuum dried.
[00119]           The purification step under sterile conditions was performed with reverse phase
HPLC. Buffer A=0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and buffer B=70% acetonitrile, 30% H20, 0.09%
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). By using a C18 column, the elution of the sample was based upon
hydrophobicity (hydrophilic sample elutes earlier). The peak detection was performed by absorbance
                                                   28

 WO 2014/004866                                                                        PCT/US2013/048247
measurement of peptide bond at 214 nm and identified by mass spectrometry. The desired fraction
was pooled in sterile vials and lyophilized with sample taken for AAA (amino acid analysis)
analytical rpHPLC and Mass Spectrometry.
[00120]            The results of quality control tests on the B-chain produced provide a clear solution
with a pH of 3.5 to 4.5 and a protein concentration of 3.5-4.5 mg/ml (382 mg/ml) measured using
Bio-Rad Assay Bio-Rad Laboratories. The immunoreactivity/potency of human insulin RIA was 10
30 uU/mg protein/ml (80.2 uU/ml) using Diagnostic System Laboratorieskit.              Purity was measured
using HPLC to provide an area p % of at least 95% (>99%) corresponding to < 500 ppm (<20 ppm).
The identity of the B-chain was verified using mass spectrometry to provide a mass of 3400-3450 Da
(single major peak 3428.7 Da). The amino acid sequence analyzer provided 30 amino acid of human
B-chain insulin sequence.        Pyrogens were measured via the standard USP method and meet
requirements for absence of absence of pyrogens.          Sterility for the absence of pyrogens was also
measured and the peptide was found to be sterile.
[00121]            The insulin B-chain can be treated to increase its solubility, e.g., to counter the effect
of its hydrophobicity. This can be done by acidification and/or by using 4M urea buffer and/or by
reducing cysteine with DTT to avoid dinierization.
Example 3 - Administration of Insulin B-chain
[00122]            The diabetes prone BBDP/WOR rats (the only other animal model of Type I diabetes
apart from the NOD mice) received the IBC (insulin B-chain in IFA) vaccine at a diabetes and
insulitis free period of their life and neither the low dose nor the high dose precipitated early insulitis
or diabetes.
[00123]            Serum samples from the BBDP/WOR rats (6 rats /groups) were analyzed for insulin
antibodies. There was a significant difference between the vehicle control vs. 100             tg insulin B
chain/rat and 500 pg insulin B-chain/rat doses (23.6 gU/ml+3.9SE vs. 37.9 pU/ml+4.5SE and 44.5
pU/ml--3.3SE; significance p=0.03 and p-0.002 respectively; no significant difference between low
and high dose groups in insulin antibody titers). The IBC vaccine was prepared fresh before injecting
the animals. The preparations were sampled on Day I and Day 14.
[00124]            The insulin B-chain was also analyzed for pyrogens as per the standard USP method
and been reported as meeting the requirements for absence of pyrogenes.
[00125]            IFA approved for human use has been used, thus these intervention strategies can be
directly applied in human diabetes. The IFA is safe and effective in humans. IFA is currently used in
HIV and other vaccination trials (peptide-based melanoma vaccine at Univ. Virginia) approved by
FDA.      Potential local side effects are similar to any commonly used adjuvant vaccinations (alum is
currently used in human vaccines) and can include induration, moderate pain and low-grade fever.

The injections can be given in small volume (1 ml) in deep intramuscular space, thus minimizing the
local side effects.
[00126]           The composition contains two components: an adjuvant, and insulin B-chain and was
prepared under conditions suitable for human administration.      The first component is insulin B-chain,
prepared and solubilized as described in Example 2.
[00127]           The second component is an IFA, e.g., Montanide ISA51 (Seppic Inc. France; Drug
Master-file No: 10870DMF) or an equivalent composition. This IFA has been used in our animal
studies and showed no systemic or significant local side effect. The injections were prepared fresh,
immediately before administration, as an emulsion, in a lamina-flow protected hood, under sterile
conditions by using high pressure sterile syringes with an 18 gauge spatial connector. 2 mg of insulin
B-chain (0.5 ml) was mixed with Montanide ISA51 (0.5 ml). An equivalent composition can be used.
The emulsion is a 50/50 (weight by weight) emulsion. The emulsion was given intramuscularly to an
adult human subject in a I ml volume in the thigh.
[00128]           A comprehensive toxicology/safety study on the vaccine described herein was
performed. Intramuscular injection of the insulin B-chain/IFA vaccine on each of days 1, 7 and 14 to
male BBDP/WOR and Sprague-Dawley rats at dose levels of 100 and 500pg/rat, followed by a 14
day observation period had no toxicologically significant effects on clinical observation, body
weights, food consumption, clinical pathology (hematology, coagulation, and clinical chemistry) and
organ weights. Macroscopic (all animals) and microscopic (BBDP/WOR rats in low dose, high dose
and vehicle control groups) evaluation showed injection site changes, including granulomatous
inflammation attributable to the vehicle article.
Example 4 - Combination Pre-Clinical Study
[00129]           The CTLA4-Ig with human insulin B-chain vaccine combination therapy in fully
diabetic NOD mice was not seen to reverse the diabetes in these animals.            Thus, the combination
therapy did not cure the already diabetic NOD mice. Since it has previously been observed that only
massive immune suppression like antiCD3 cure a population of the NOD from diabetes -, such a
result is not surprising. However the survival was better in the combination therapy starting with
abatacept followed by B-chain vaccine, than in either abatacept or B-chain vaccine alone, thus
providing a clinically useful effect. The diabetes in NOD is florid autoimmune process compared to
diabetes in human. Abatacept alone given to NOD mice shortly before their onset of diabetes (>10
weeks of age; Lenschow et al.) did not alter the course of the disease in these animals, however
abatacept alone was hugely effective in human even after the clinical onset of their diabetes. Thus
abatacept did not cure NOD diabetes in this study has low relevance to a finding that the combination
as described herein can be hugely effective in human disease even in an advanced stage i.e. post
clinical onset. Thus treatment effect is expected before, at or after clinical diagnosis in humans (longer

and intervention settings. (See Clin Immunol. 2012 Mar;142(3):402-3).
Example 5 - Human Trial
[00130]           Human insulin B-chain in IFA (Montanide ICA 51) was given to newly diagnosed
patients with Type I diabetes in a phase I safety clinical trial. In a placebo controlled double blind
trial subjects received 2mg human insulin B-chain in IFA or vehicle in IFA as a single i.m. injection
within 3 months of diagnosis. The patients were followed for 2 years. The vaccination showed
excellent safety profile. The vaccine induced a highly desirable immune effect, generated insulin B
chain specific regulatory T cells. Antigen specific regulatory T cells are considered the "holy grail" to
control and suppress autoimmunity.       Further details of this study are found in Orban et al., Lancet
2011; 378 (9789): 412-9, herein incorporated by reference.
