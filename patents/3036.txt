FIELD OF THE INVENTION
           The present invention relates to the field of immunology. More specifically, the present invention relates to
anti-NGF antigen binding proteins or antibodies that have been modified to become non-immunogenic in canines,
particularly chimeric antibodies and caninized antibodies that specifically bind to canine NGF. The invention further
concerns use of such antigen binding proteins or antibodies in the treatment and/or prevention of NGF related
disorders, particularly pain, in canines.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           Nerve growth factor (NGF) was the first neurotrophin to be identified, and its role in the development and
survival of both peripheral and central neurons has been well characterized. NGF has been shown to be a critical
survival and maintenance factor in the development of peripheral sympathetic and embryonic sensory neurons and
of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (Smeyne, et al., Nature 368:246-249 (1994) and Crowley, et al., Cell 76:
1001-101 I (1994)). NGF upregulates expression of neuropeptides in sensory neurons (Lindsay, et al, Nature
337:362-364 (1989)), and its activity is mediated through two different membrane-bound receptors, the TrkA
tyrosine kinase receptor and the p75 common neurotrophin receptor (sometimes termed "high affinity" and "low
affinity" NGF receptors, respectively) which is structurally related to other members of the tumor necrosis factor
receptor family (Chao, et al., Science 232:518-521 (1986)).
           In addition to its effects in the nervous system, NGF has been increasingly implicated in processes outside
of the nervous system. For example, NGF has been shown to enhance vascular permeability (Otten, et al., Eur J
Pharmacol. 106: 199-201 (1984)), enhance T- and B-cell immune responses (Otten, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
USA 86:10059-10063 (1989)), induce lymphocyte differentiation and mast cell proliferation and cause the release of
soluble biological signals from mast cells (Matsuda, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:6508-6512 (1988); Pearce,
et al., J. Physiol. 3 72:3 79-393 (1986); Bischoff, et al., Blood 79:2662-2669 (1992); Horigome, et al., J. Bioi. Chem.
268:14881-14887 (1993)).
           NGF is produced by a number of cell types including mast cells (Leon, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
91:3739-3743 (1994)), B-lymphocytes (Torcia, et al., Cell 85:345-356 (1996), keratinocytes (Di Marco, et al., J.
Bioi. Chem. 268: 22838-22846)), smooth muscle cells (Ueyama, et al., J Hypertens. 11: 1061-1065 (1993)),
fibroblasts (Lindholm, et al., Eur. J. Neurosci. 2:795-801 (1990)), bronchial epithelial cells (Kassel, et al., Clin, Exp.
Allergy 31:1432-40 (2001)), renal mesangial cells (Steiner, et al., Am. J. Physiol. 261: F792-798 (1991)) and skeletal
muscle myotubes (Schwartz, et al., JPhotochem.Photobiol. B66: 195-200 (2002)). NGF receptors have been found
                                                              1

on a variety of cell types outside of the nervous system. For example, TrkA has been found on human monocytes, T
and B-lymphocytes and mast cells.
          An association between increased NGF levels and a variety of inflammatory conditions has been observed
in human patients as well as in several animal models. These include systemic lupus erythematosus (Bracci
Laudiero, et al., Neuroreport 4:563-565 (1993)), multiple sclerosis (BracciLaudiero, et al, Neurosci. Lett. 147:9-12
(1992)), psoriasis (Raychaudhuri, et al., Acta Derm. l'enereol. 78:84-86 (1998)), arthritis (Falcim, et al., Ann.
Rheum. Dis. 55:745-748 (1996)), interstitial cystitis (Okragly, et al., J. Urology 161: 438-441 (1999)) and asthma
(Braun, et al., Eur. JImmunol. 28:3240-3251 (1998)).
          Consistently, an elevated level of NGF in peripheral tissues is associated with hyperalgesia and
inflammation and has been observed in a number of forms of arthritis. The synovium of patients affected by
rheumatoid arthritis expresses high levels of NGF while in non-inflamed synovium NGF has been reported to be
undetectable (Aloe, et al., Arch. Rheum. 35:351-355 (1992)). Similar results were seen in rats with experimentally
induced rheumatoid arthritis (Aloe, et al., Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 10:203-204 (1992)). Elevated levels of NGF have
been reported in transgenic arthritic mice along with an increase in the number of mast cells (Aloe, et al., Int. J
Tissue Reactions-Exp. Clin. Aspects 15:139-143 (1993)).
          Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common chronic musculoskeletal diseases in dogs, affecting 20% of
the canine population over one year of age. The development of OA is mainly secondary to trauma, joint instability,
and diseases such as hip dysplasia. Osteoarthritis is a disease condition of the entire joint, and both inflammatory
and degenerative changes of all articular structures result in disability and clinical signs of lameness and pain. Pain
is the most important clinical manifestation of canine OA and it is the result of a complex interplay between
structural joint changes, biochemical and molecular alterations, as well as peripheral and central pain-processing
mechanisms. Within this network, the activation and sensitization of peripheral nociceptors by inflammatory and
hyperalgesic mediators (e.g. cytokines, prostaglandins and neuromediators) is one of the main peripheral
mechanisms responsible for the joint pain.       Nerve growth factor (NGF) is one of the neuromediators that has
received broader attention as a key regulator involved in both inflammatory and neuropathic pain. (Isola et al. Vet
Comp Orthop Traumatol 4: 2011 pgs 279-284)

           As used herein, the term "comprising" is intended to mean that the compositions and methods include the
recited elements, but not excluding others.
           As used herein, the term "nerve growth factor" and "NGF" refers to nerve growth factor and variants
thereof that retain at least part of the biological activity of NGF.
           "NGF receptor" refers to a polypeptide that is bound by or activated by NGF. NGF receptors include the
TrkA receptor and to a lesser extent the p75 receptor of canines.
           "Biological activity" of NGF generally refers to the ability to bind NGF receptors and/or activate NGF
receptor signaling pathways. Without limitation, a biological activity includes anyone or more of the following: the
ability to bind an NGF receptor (such as TrkA and/or p75); the ability to promote TrkA receptor dimerization and/or
autophosphorylation; the ability to activate an NGF receptor signaling pathway; the ability to promote cell
differentiation, proliferation, survival, growth and other changes in cell physiology, including (in the case of
neurons, including peripheral and central neuron) change in neuronal morphology, synaptogenesis, synaptic
function, neurotransmitter and/or neuropeptide release and regeneration following damage; the ability to promote
survival of mouse E13.5 trigeminal neurons; and the ability to mediate pain, including post-surgical pain.
           As used herein, an "anti-NGF antigen binding protein" (interchangeably termed "anti-NGF antibody" and
"anti-NGF antagonist antibody") refers to an antigen binding protein which is able to bind to NGF and inhibit NGF
biological activity and/or downstream pathway(s) mediated by NGF signaling. An anti-NGF antagonist antibody
encompasses antibodies that block, antagonize, suppress or reduce (including significantly) NGF biological activity,
including downstream pathways mediated by NGF signaling and/or inhibit NGF from binding to its receptor trkA,
such as receptor binding and/or elicitation of a cellular response to NGF. For purpose of the present invention, it will
be explicitly understood that the term "anti-NGF antagonist antibody" encompass all the previously identified terms,
titles, and functional states and characteristics whereby the NGF itself, an NGF biological activity (including but not
limited to its ability to ability to mediate any aspect of post-surgical pain), or the consequences of the biological
activity, are substantially nullified, decreased, or neutralized in any meaningful degree. In some embodiments, an
anti-NGF antagonist antibody binds NGF and prevent NGF dimerization and/or binding to an NGF receptor (such as
TrkA and/or p75). In other embodiments, an anti-NGF antibody binds NGF and prevents TrkA receptor
dimerization and/or TrkA autophosphorylation. Examples of anti-NGF antagonist antibodies are provided herein.
           As used herein, the term "antigen binding protein", "antibody" and the like, which may be used
interchangeably, refers to a polypeptide, or fragment thereof, comprising an antigen binding site.              In one
embodiment of the present invention the antigen binding protein of the invention further provides an intact
immunoglobulin capable of specific binding to a target, such as a carbohydrate, polynucleotide, lipid, polypeptide,
etc., through at least one antigen recognition site located in the variable region of the immunoglobulin molecule. An
intact antibody has two light and two heavy chains. Thus a single isolated intact antibody may be a polyclonal
antibody, a monoclonal antibody, a synthetic antibody, a recombinant antibody, a chimeric antibody, a
heterochimeric antibody. The term "antigen binding protein" "antibody' preferably refers to monoclonal antibodies
and fragments thereof, and immunologic binding equivalents thereof that can bind to the NGF protein and fragments
thereof. The term antibody and antigen binding protein are used to refer to a homogeneous molecular, or a mixture
such as a serum product made up of a plurality of different molecular entities. As used herein, the term encompasses
                                                              15

not only intact polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, but also fragments thereof. For the purposes of the present
invention, "antibody" and "antigen binding protein" also includes antibody fragments, unless otherwise stated.
Exemplary antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv, scFv, Fd, dAb, diabodies, their antigen-recognizing
fragments, small modular immunopharmaceuticals (SMIPs) nanobodies, IgNAR molecules and the like all
recognized by one of skill in the art to be an antigen binding protein or antibody fragment and any of above
mentioned fragments and their chemically or genetically manipulated counterparts, as well as other antibody
fragments and mutants thereof, fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, and any other modified
configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that comprises an antigen recognition site. Antibodies and antigen
binding proteins can be made, for example, via traditional hybridoma techniques (Kohler et al., Nature 256:495-499
(1975)), recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567), or phage display techniques using antibody
libraries (Clackson et al., Nature 352:624-628 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597 (1991)). For various
other antibody production techniques, see Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, eds. Harlow et al., Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory, 1988 as well as other techniques that are well known to those skilled in the art.
          A "monoclonal antibody" as defined herein is an antibody produced by a single clone of cells (specifically,
a single clone of hybridoma cells) and therefore a single pure homogeneous type of antibody. All monoclonal
antibodies produced from the same clone are identical and have the same antigen specificity. Monoclonal antibodies
are a homogeneous antibody population wherein the monoclonal antibody is comprised of amino acids (naturally
occurring and non-naturally occurring) that are involved in the selective binding of an antigen. A population of
monoclonal antibodies is highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. The term "monoclonal
antibody" encompasses not only intact monoclonal antibodies and full-length monoclonal antibodies, but also
fragments thereof (Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv, scFv, Fd, dAb, diabodies, their antigen-recognizing fragments, small
modular immunopharmaceuticals (SMIPs) nanobodies, IgNAR molecules and the like), mutants thereof, fusion
proteins comprising an antibody portion, and any other modified configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that
comprises an antigen recognition site of the required specificity and the ability to bind to an antigen. It is not
intended to be limited as regards to the source of the antibody or the manner in which it is made (e.g., by hybridoma,
phage selection, recombinant expression, transgenic animals, etc.).
          The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a
portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies
derived from a particular species, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to
corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so
long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. Typically, chimeric antibodies are antibodies whose light and
heavy chain genes have been constructed, typically by genetic engineering, from antibody variable and constant
region genes belonging to different species. For example, the variable segments of the genes from a mouse
monoclonal antibody may be joined to canine constant segments. FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of the general
structure of one embodiment of a mouse: canine IgG. In this embodiment, the antigen binding site is derived from
mouse while the Fc portion is canine.
          The term "heterochimeric" as defined herein, refers to an antibody in which one of the antibody chains
(heavy or light) is caninized while the other is chimeric. FIG. 4 depicts one embodiment of a heterochimeric
                                                           16

molecule. In this embodiment, a caninized variable heavy chain (where all of the CDRs are mouse and all FRs are
canine) is paired with a chimeric variable light chain (where all of the CDRs are mouse and all FRs are mouse. In
this embodiment, both the variable heavy and variable light chains are fused to a canine constant region.
          "Caninized" forms of non-canine (e.g., murine) antibodies are genetically engineered antibodies that
contain minimal sequence derived from non-canine immunoglobulin. "Caninization" is defined as a method for
transferring non-canine antigen-binding information from a donor antibody to a less immunogenic canine antibody
acceptor to generate treatments useful as therapeutics in dogs. Caninized antibodies are canine immunoglobulins
(recipient antibody) in which hypervariable region residues of the recipient are replaced by hypervariable region
residues from a non-canine species (donor antibody) such as such as mouse, rat, rabbit, cat, dogs, goat, chicken,
bovine, horse, llama, camel, dromedaries, sharks, non-human primates, human, humanized, recombinant sequence,
or an engineered sequence having the desired properties , specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances,
framework region (FR) residues of the canine immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-canine residues.
Furthermore, caninized antibodies may include residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor
antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. The modifications to the
hypervariable regions and/or the framework regions, as described herein, are determined for each separately
engineered speciated (caninized) antibody based on experimentation known to those in the art and cannot be
predicted prior to said experimentation. In general, the caninized antibody will include substantially all of at least
one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable regions correspond to
those of a non-canine immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a canine immunoglobulin
sequence. The caninized antibody optionally also will comprise a complete, or at least a portion of an
immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a canine immunoglobulin. FIG. 3 is an illustration of one
embodiment showing speciation or caninization of a mouse IgG. In this embodiment, mouse CDRs are grafted onto
canine frameworks. In some cases, mouse frameworks or residues therein that are outside of the hypervariable
region are maintained.
          The phrase "recombinant canine antibody" includes canine antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created
or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies expressed using a recombinant expression vector transfected
into a host cell, antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial canine antibody library, antibodies isolated
from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic for canine immunoglobulin genes (see e.g., Taylor, L. D., et al.
(1992) Nucl. Acids Res. 20:6287-6295) or antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means
that involves splicing of canine immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences.
          The term "canine antibody", as used herein, refers to a canine antibody that is generated against a target
and is prepared by hybridoma methods well known to one skilled in the art and described herein.
          "Native antibodies" and "native immunoglobulins" are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about
150,000 Daltons, composed of two identical light (1) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is
linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the
heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain
disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant
domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant
                                                         17

domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light-chain variable
domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form
an interface between the light- and heavy-chain variable domains. FIG. 1 is an example of the general structure of a
native mouse immunoglobulin G (lgG) highlighting the antigen binding site.
          The "parent" antibody herein is one that is encoded by an amino acid sequence used for the preparation of
the variant. Preferably, the parent antibody has a canine framework region and, if present, has canine antibody
constant region(s). For example, the parent antibody may be a caninized or canine antibody.
          Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of the heavy chains of antibodies,
immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. Presently there are five major classes of immunoglobulins:
IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these maybe further divided into subclasses isotopess), e.g., IgG 1, IgG2,
IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA 2 (as defined by mouse and human designation). The heavy-chain constant domains that
correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma, and mu,
respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins
are well known in multiple species. The prevalence of individual isotypes and functional activities associated with
these constant domains are species-specific and must be experimentally defined.
          The "light chains" of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of
two clearly distinct types, called kappa (K) and lambda (k), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant
domains.
          A "variable region" of an antibody refers to the variable region of the antibody light chain or the variable
region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combination. The variable regions of the heavy and light chain
each consist of four framework regions (FR) connected by three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) also
known as hypervariable regions. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with
the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies. There are at
least two techniques for determining CDRs: (I) an approach based on cross-species sequence variability (i.e., Kabat
et al. Sequences of Proteinsof Immunological Interest, (5th ed., 1991, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda Md.));
and (2) an approach based on crystallographic studies of antigen-antibody complexes (Chothia et al. (1989) Nature
342:877; AI-lazikani et al (1997) J Molec. Bioi. 273:927-948)). As used herein, a CDR may refer to CDRs defined
by either approach or by a combination of both approaches.
          The term "hypervariable region" when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which
are responsible for antigen binding. The hypervariable region comprises               amino acid residues from a
"complementarity determining region" or "CDR" (Kabat, et al. (1991), above) and/or those residues from a
"hypervariable loop" (Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987). "Framework" or "FR" residues are those
variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.
          As used herein, the term "antigen binding region" refers to that portion of an antibody molecule which
contains the amino acid residues that interact with an antigen and confer on the antibody its specificity and affinity
for the antigen. The antibody binding region includes the "framework" amino acid residues necessary to maintain the
proper conformation of the antigen-binding residues.
                                                          18

           A "functional Fc region" possesses at least one effector function of a native sequence Fc region.
Exemplary "effector functions" include Clq binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); Fc receptor
binding; neonatal receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down
regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor; BCR), etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc
region to be combined with a binding domain (e.g. an antibody variable domain) and can be assessed using various
assays known in the art for evaluating such antibody effector functions.
          A "native sequence Fc region" comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of
an Fc region found in nature. A "variant Fc region" or a "mutated" or "mutant" Fc region comprises an amino acid
sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification,
and may or may not retain at least one effector function of the native sequence Fc region. Preferably, the variant Fc
region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a
parent polypeptide, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably from about one to
about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The
variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80% sequence identity with a native sequence Fc
region and/or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide, and most preferably at least about 90% sequence identity
therewith, more preferably at least about 95% sequence identity therewith. A variant or mutated Fc region may also
essentially eliminate the function of the Fc region of the antibody. For example Fc region mutations may eliminate
effector function of the antibody. In one embodiment of the invention the antibody of the invention comprises a
mutated Fc region.
          As used herein, "Fc receptor" and "FcR" describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The
preferred FcR is a native sequence FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma
receptor) and includes receptors of the FcyRI, FcyRII, and FcyRIII subclasses, including allelic variants and
alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. FcyRII receptors include FcyRIIA (an "activating receptor") and
FcyRIIB (an "inhibiting receptor"), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic
domains thereof. FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, 1991, Ann. Rev. Immunol., 9:457-92; Capel et al., 1994,
Immunomethods, 4:25-34; and de Haas et al., 1995, J Lab. Clin. Med., 126:330-41. "FcR" also includes the neonatal
receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., 1976, J Immunol.,
117:587; and Kim et al., 1994, J. Immunol., 24:249).
          As used herein "antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity" and "ADCC" refer to a cell-mediated
reaction in which nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc receptors (FcRs) (e.g. natural killer (NK) cells,
neutrophils, and macrophages) recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target
cell. ADCC activity of a molecule of interest can be assessed using an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described
in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) and NK cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be
assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al., 1998, PNAS (USA), 95:652-656.
          "Complement dependent cytotoxicity" and "CDC" refer to the lysing of a target in the presence of
complement. The complement activation pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the
complement system (Clq) to a molecule (e.g. an antibody) complexed with a cognate antigen. To assess
                                                            19

complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., J Immunol. Methods, 202: 163
(1996), may be performed.
           Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called "Fab" fragments,
each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual "Fc" fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize
readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab') 2 fragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of
cross-linking antigen.
           The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CHI)
of the heavy chain. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxyl
terminus of the heavy chain CHI domain including one or more cysteine(s) from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH
is the designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group.
F(ab') 2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between
them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.
           "Fv' is the minimum antibody fragment that contains a complete antigen-recognition and binding site. This
region consists of a dimer of one heavy chain and one light chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association.
It is in this configuration that the three hypervariable regions of each variable domain interact to define an antigen
binding site on the surface of the    VH-VL   dimer. Collectively, the six hypervariable regions confer antigen-binding
specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three
hypervariable regions specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower
affinity than the entire binding site.
           An "antigen", as used herein, refers to the antigenic determinant recognized by the CDRs of the antigen
binding protein or antibody as described herein. In other words, epitope refers to that portion of any molecule
capable of being recognized by, and bound by, an antibody. Unless indicated otherwise, the term "epitope" as used
herein, refers to the region of NGF to which an anti-NGF antigen binding protein/antibody/agent binds.
           The term "antigen binding domain," "active fragments of an antibody" or the like refers to the part of an
antibody or antigen binding protein that comprises the area specifically binding to or complementary to a part or all
of an antigen. Where an antigen is large, an antibody may only bind to a particular part of the antigen. The
"epitope," "active fragments of an epitope," or "antigenic determinant" or the like is a portion of an antigen
molecule that is responsible for specific interactions with the antigen binding domain of an antibody. An antigen
binding domain may be provided by one or more antibody variable domains (e.g., a so-called Fd antibody fragment
consisting of a VH domain). An antigen binding domain may comprise an antibody light chain variable domain
(VL) and an antibody heavy chain variable domain (VH) (U.S. Patent No. 5,565,332).
           The terms "binding portion" of an antibody (or "antibody portion") or antigen-binding polypeptide or the
like includes one or more complete domains, e.g., a pair of complete domains, as well as fragments of an antibody
that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen, e.g., NGF. It has been shown that the binding function of an
antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Binding fragments are produced by recombinant
DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact immunoglobulins. Binding fragments include Fab,
Fab', F(ab') 2, Fabc, Fd, dAb, Fv, single chains, single-chain antibodies, e.g., scFv, and single domain antibodies
(Muyldermans et al., 2001, 26:230-5), and an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR). Fab fragment is
                                                              20

a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CHI domains. F(ab') 2 fragment is a bivalent fragment
comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region. Fd fragment consists of the VH and
CHI domains, and Fv fragment consists of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody. A dAb fragment
consists of a VH domain (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546). While the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL
and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that
enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent
molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv) (Bird et al., 1988, Science 242:423-426). Such single chain antibodies
are also intended to be encompassed within the term "binding portion" of an antibody. Other forms of single chain
antibodies, such as diabodies are also encompassed. Diabodies are bivalent, bispecific antibodies in which VH and
VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing
between the two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of
another chain and creating two antigen binding sites (see e.g., Holliger, et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
90:6444-6448). An antibody or binding portion thereof also may be part of a larger immunoadhesion molecules
formed by covalent or non-covalent association of the antibody or antibody portion with one or more other proteins
or peptides. Examples of such immunoadhesion molecules include use of the streptavidin core region to make a
tetrameric scFv molecule (Kipriyanov, S. M., et al. (1995) Human Antibodies and Hybridomas 6:93-101) and use of
a cysteine residue, a marker peptide and a C-terminal polyhistidine tag to make bivalent and biotinylated scFv
molecules (Kipriyanov, S. M., et al. (1994) Mol. Immunol. 31:1047-1058). Binding fragments such as Fab and
F(ab') 2 fragments, can be prepared from whole antibodies using conventional techniques, such as papain or pepsin
digestion, respectively, of whole antibodies. Moreover, antibodies, antibody portions and immunoadhesion
molecules can be obtained using standard recombinant DNA techniques, as described herein and as known in the art.
Other than "bispecific" or "bifunctional" antibodies, an antibody is understood to have each of its binding sites
identical. A "bispecific" or "bifunctional antibody" is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light
chain pairs and two different binding sites. A bispecific antibody can also include two antigen binding regions with
an intervening constant region. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of
hybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol. 79:315-321, 1990.;
Kostelny et al., 1992, J. Immunol. 148, 1547-1553.
          The term "backmutation" refers to a process in which some or all of the somatically mutated amino acids of
a canine antibody are replaced with the corresponding germline residues from a homologous germline antibody
sequence. The heavy and light chain sequences of the canine antibody of the invention are aligned separately with
the germline sequences to identify the sequences with the highest homology. Differences in the canine antibody of
the invention are returned to the germline sequence by mutating defined nucleotide positions encoding such different
amino acid. The role of each amino acid thus identified as candidate for backmutation should be investigated for a
direct or indirect role in antigen binding and any amino acid found after mutation to affect any desirable
characteristic of the canine antibody should not be included in the final canine antibody; as an example, activity
enhancing amino acids identified by the selective mutagenesis approach will not be subject to backmutation. To
minimize the number of amino acids subject to backmutation those amino acid positions found to be different from
the closest germline sequence but identical to the corresponding amino acid in a second germline sequence can
                                                          21

remain, provided that the second germline sequence is identical and colinear to the sequence of the canine antibody
of the invention. Back mutation of selected target framework residues to the corresponding donor residues might be
required to restore and or improved affinity.
           As used herein, "immunospecific" binding of antibodies refers to the antigen specific binding interaction
that occurs between the antigen-combining site of an antibody and the specific antigen recognized by that antibody
(i.e., the antibody reacts with the protein in an ELISA or other immunoassay, and does not react detectably with
unrelated proteins). An epitope that "specifically binds", or "preferentially binds" (used interchangeably herein) to
an antibody or a polypeptide is a term well understood in the art, and methods to determine such specific or
preferential binding are also well known in the art. A molecule is said to exhibit "specific binding" or "preferential
binding" if it reacts or associates more frequently, more rapidly, with greater duration and/or with greater affinity
with a particular cell or substance than it does with alternative cells or substances. An antibody "specifically binds"
or "preferentially binds" to a target if it binds with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater
duration than it binds to other substances. For example, an antibody that specifically or preferentially binds to an
NGF epitope is an antibody that binds this epitope with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater
duration than it binds to other NGF epitopes or non-NGF epitopes. It is also understood by reading this definition
that, for example, an antibody (or moiety or epitope) that specifically or preferentially binds to a first target mayor
may not specifically or preferentially bind to a second target. As such, "specific binding" or "preferential binding"
does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding. Generally, but not necessarily, reference to
binding means preferential binding.
           The term "specifically" in the context of antibody binding, refers to high avidity and/or high affinity
binding of an antibody to a specific antigen, i.e., a polypeptide, or epitope. Antibody specifically binding an antigen
is stronger than binding of the same antibody to other antigens. Antibodies which bind specifically to a polypeptide
may be capable of binding other polypeptides at a weak, yet detectable level (e.g., 10% or less of the binding shown
to the polypeptide of interest). Such weak binding, or background binding, is readily discernible from the specific
antibody binding to a subject polypeptide, e.g. by use of appropriate controls. In general, specific antibodies bind to
an antigen with a binding affinity with a Kd of 10-7 M or less, e.g., 10-' M or less e.g., 10- 9 M or less, 1010 or less,
101 or less, 10.12 or less, or 1013 or less etc.
           As used herein, the term "affinity" refers to the strength of the binding of a single antigen-combining site
with an antigenic determinant. Affinity depends on the closeness of stereochemical fit between antibody or antigen
binding protein combining sites and antigen determinants, on the size of the area of contact between them, on the
distribution of charged and hydrophobic groups, etc. Antibody affinity can be measured by equilibrium analysis or
by the Surface Plasmon Resonance-"SPR" method ( for example BIACORE TM. The SPR method relies on the
phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which occurs when surface plasmon waves are excited at a
metal/liquid interface. Light is directed at, and reflected from, the side of the surface not in contact with sample, and
SPR causes a reduction in the reflected light intensity at a specific combination of angle and wavelength.
Bimolecular binding events cause changes in the refractive index at the surface layer, which are detected as changes
in the SPR signal.
                                                             22

          The term "Kd', as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation constant of an antibody-antigen
interaction. The dissociation constant, Kd, and the association constant, Ka, are quantitative measures of affinity. At
equilibrium, free antigen (Ag) and free antibody (Ab) are in equilibrium with antigen-antibody complex (Ag-Ab),
and the rate constants, ka and kd, quantitate the rates of the individual reactions. At equilibrium, ka [Ab][Ag]=kd
[Ag-Ab]. The dissociation constant, Kd, is given by: Kd=kd/ka=[Ag][Ab]/[Ag-Ab].            Kd has units of concentration,
most typically M, mM, pM, nM, pM, etc. When comparing antibody affinities expressed as Kd, having greater
affinity for NGF is indicated by a lower value. The association constant, Ka, is given by: Ka=ka/kd=[Ag
Ab]/[Ag][Ab].    Ka has units of inverse concentration, most typically M-1, mM-',        p.M-', nM-', pM-1, etc. As used
herein, the term "avidity" refers to the strength of the antigen-antibody bond after formation of reversible
complexes. Anti-NGF antibodies may be characterized in terms of the Kd for their binding to a NGF protein, as
binding "with a dissociation constant (Kd) in the range of from about (lower Kd value) to about (upper Kd value)."
          The terms "polypeptide", "oligopeptide", "peptide" and "protein" are used interchangeably herein to refer to
polymers of amino acids of any length. The polymer may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino
acids, and it may be interrupted by non-amino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been
modified naturally or by intervention; for example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation,
phosphorylation, or any other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labeling component. Also
included within the definition are, for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid
(including, for example, un-natural amino acids, etc.), as well as other modifications known in the art. It is
understood that, because the polypeptides of this invention are based upon an antibody, the polypeptides can occur
as single chains or associated chains.
          The term 'conservative amino acid substitution" indicates any amino acid substitution for a given amino
acid residue, where the substitute residue is so chemically similar to that of the given residue that no substantial
decrease in polypeptide function (e.g., enzymatic activity) results. Conservative amino acid substitutions are
commonly known in the art and examples thereof are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,790,639, 6,774,107,
6,194,167, or 5,350,576. In a preferred embodiment, a conservative amino acid substitution will be anyone that
occurs within one of the following six groups:
          * 1. Small aliphatic, substantially non-polar residues: Ala, Gly, Pro, Ser, and Thr;
          * 2. Large aliphatic, non-polar residues: lie, Leu, and Val; Met;
          * 3. Polar, negatively charged residues and their amides: Asp and Glu;
          * 4. Amides of polar, negatively charged residues: Asn and Gin; His;
          * 5. Polar, positively charged residues: Arg and Lys; His; and
          * 6. Large aromatic residues: Trp and Tyr; Phe.
          In a preferred embodiment, a conservative amino acid substitution will be any one of the following, which
are listed as Native Residue (Conservative Substitutions) pairs: Ala (Ser); Arg (Lys); Asn (Gin; His); Asp (Glu); Gin
(Asn); Glu (Asp); Gly (Pro); His (Asn;Gin); lie (Leu; Val); Leu (lie; Val); Lys (Arg; Gin; Glu); Met (Leu; lie); Phe
(Met; Leu; Tyr); Ser (Thr); Thr (Ser); Trp (Tyr); Tyr (Trp; Phe); and Val (lie; Leu).
                                                             23

          The terms "nucleic acid", "polynucleotide",         "nucleic acid molecule" and the like may be used
interchangeably herein and refer to a series of nucleotide bases (also called "nucleotides") in DNA and RNA. The
nucleic acid may contain deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, and/or their analogs. The term "nucleic acid"
includes, for example, single-stranded and double-stranded molecules. A nucleic acid can be, for example, a gene or
gene fragment, exons, introns, a DNA molecule (e.g., cDNA), an RNA molecule (e.g., mRNA), recombinant nucleic
acids, plasmids, and other vectors, primers and probes. Both 5' to 3' (sense) and 3' to 5' (antisense) polynucleotides
are included. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or
their analogs, or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase. A poly
nucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present,
modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of
nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after
polymerization, such as by conjugation with a labeling component. Other types of modifications include, for
example, "caps", substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide
modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters,
phosphoamidates, cabamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.),
those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides,
ply-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals,
radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g.,
alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide(s). Further, any of the
hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate
groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides,
or may be conjugated to solid supports. The 5' and 3' terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines
or organic capping groups moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to
standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that
are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2-0-methyl-, 2-0-allyl, 2'-fluoro- or 2'-azido-ribose,
carbocyclic sugar analogs, anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars,
furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs and abasic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or
more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups
include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(O)S("thioate"), P(S)S ("dithioate"),
"(O)NR2 ("amidate"), P(O)R, P(O)OR', CO orCH2 ("formacetal"), in which each R or R' is independently H or
substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (-0-) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl,
cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to
all polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and DNA.
          As used herein, "vector" means a construct, which is capable of delivering, and preferably expressing, one
or more gene(s) or sequence(s) of interest in a host cell. Examples of vectors include, but are not limited to, viral
vectors, naked DNA or RNA expression vectors, plasmid, cosmid or phage vectors, DNA or RNA expression
vectors associated with cationic condensing agents, DNA or RNA expression vectors encapsulated in liposomes, and
certain eukaryotic cells, such as producer cells. Vectors, as described herein, have expression control sequences
                                                            24

meaning that a nucleic acid sequence that directs transcription of a nucleic acid. An expression control sequence can
be a promoter, such as a constitutive or an inducible promoter, or an enhancer. The expression control sequence is
'operably linked' to the nucleic acid sequence to be transcribed. A nucleic acid is "operably linked" when it is placed
into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory
leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion
of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of
the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate
translation. Generally, "operably linked" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the
case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous.
Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic
oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.
          Just as a polypeptide may contain conservative amino acid substitution(s), a polynucleotide thereof may
contain conservative codon substitution(s). A codon substitution is considered conservative if, when expressed, it
produces a conservative amino acid substitution, as described above. Degenerate codon substitution, which results in
no amino acid substitution, is also useful in polynucleotides according to the present invention. Thus, e.g., a
polynucleotide encoding a selected polypeptide useful in an embodiment of the present invention may be mutated by
degenerate codon substitution in order to approximate the codon usage frequency exhibited by an expression host
cell to be transformed therewith, or to otherwise improve the expression thereof.
          A "variant" anti-NGF antibody, refers herein to a molecule which differs in amino acid sequence from a
"parent" anti-NGF antibody amino acid sequence by virtue of addition, deletion, and/or substitution of one or more
amino acid residue(s) in the parent antibody sequence and retains at least one desired activity of the parent anti
NGF-antibody. The variant anti-NGF may comprise conservative amino acid substitutions in the hypervariable
region of the antibody, as described herein. Desired activities can include the ability to bind the antigen specifically,
the ability to reduce, inhibit or neutralize NGF activity in an animal. In one embodiment, the variant comprises one
or more amino acid substitution(s) in one or more hypervariable and/or framework region(s) of the parent antibody.
For example, the variant may comprise at least one, e.g. from about one to about ten, and preferably from about two
to about five, substitutions in one or more hypervariable and/or framework regions of the parent antibody.
Ordinarily, the variant will have an amino acid sequence having at least 50% amino acid sequence identity with the
parent antibody heavy or light chain variable domain sequences, more preferably at least 65%, more preferably at
least 75%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most
preferably at least 95% sequence identity. Identity or homology with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the
percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical with the parent antibody residues,
after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity.
None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence shall be
construed as affecting sequence identity or homology. The variant retains the ability to bind NGF and preferably has
desired activities which are equal to or superior to those of the parent antibody. For example, the variant may have a
stronger binding affinity, enhanced ability to reduce, inhibit or neutralize NGF activity in an animal, and/or
enhanced ability to inhibit NGF binding to Trk A and p75.
                                                           25

          Trk A, considered the high affinity NGF receptor is a member of the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor
(NTKR) family. This kinase is a membrane-bound receptor that, upon neurotrophin binding, phosphorylates itself
(autophosphorylation) and members of the MAPK pathway. The presence of this kinase leads to cell differentiation
and may play a role in specifying sensory neuron subtypes. The p75 receptor is considered the low affinity NGF
receptor.
          A 'variant" nucleic acid, refers herein to a molecule which differs in sequence from a -"parent" nucleic acid.
Polynucleotide sequence divergence may result from mutational changes such as deletions, substitutions, or
additions of one or more nucleotides. Each of these changes may occur alone or in combination, one or more times
in a given sequence.
          The term "isolated" means that the material (e.g., antibody or nucleic acid) is separated and/or recovered
from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that
would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the material, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other
proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. With respect to nucleic acid, an isolated nucleic acid may include one
that is separated from the 5' to 3' sequences with which it is normally associated in the chromosome. In preferred
embodiments, the material will be purified to greater than 95% by weight of the material, and most preferably more
than 99% by weight. Isolated material includes the material in situ within recombinant cells since at least one
component of the material's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated material will be
prepared by at least one purification step.
          As used herein, the terms "cell", "cell line", and "cell culture" may be used interchangeably. All of these
terms also include their progeny, which are any and all subsequent generations. It is understood that all progeny may
not be identical due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. In the context of expressing a heterologous nucleic acid
sequence, "host cell" refers to a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell (e.g., bacterial cells, yeast cells, mammalian cells, and
insect cells) whether located in vitro or in vivo. For example, host cells may be located in a transgenic animal. Host
cell can be used as a recipient for vectors and may include any transformable organism that is capable of replicating
a vector and/or expressing a heterologous nucleic acid encoded by a vector.
          The word "label" when used herein refers to a detectable compound or composition that is conjugated
directly or indirectly to the antibody or nucleic acid. The label may itself be detectable by itself (e.g., radioisotope
labels or fluorescent labels) or, in the case of an enzymatic label, may catalyze chemical alteration of a substrate
compound or composition that is detectable.
          A "subject" or "patient" refers to an animal in need of treatment that can be affected by molecules of the
invention. Animals that can be treated in accordance with the invention include vertebrates, with mammals such as
canine being particularly preferred examples.
          A "composition" is intended to mean a combination of active agent, whether chemical composition,
biological composition or biotherapeutic (particularly antigen binding proteins as described herein) and another
compound or composition which can be inert (e.g., a label), or active, such as an adjuvant.
          As defined herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carriers" suitable for use in the invention are well known
to those of skill in the art. Such carriers include, without limitation, water, saline, buffered saline, phosphate buffer,
alcohol/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions. Other conventionally employed diluents, adjuvants and
                                                            26

excipients, may be added in accordance with conventional techniques. Such carriers can include ethanol, polyols,
and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, and injectable organic esters. Buffers and pH adjusting agents may also
be employed. Buffers include, without limitation, salts prepared from an organic acid or base. Representative buffers
include, without limitation, organic acid salts, such as salts of citric acid, e.g., citrates, ascorbic acid, gluconic acid,
histidine-Hel, carbonic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, or phthalic acid, Tris, trimethanmine
hydrochloride, or phosphate buffers. Parenteral carriers can include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose,
dextrose, trehalose, sucrose, and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's or fixed oils. Intravenous carriers can include
fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers, such as those based on Ringer's dextrose and the like.
Preservatives and other additives such as, for example, antimicrobials, antioxidants, chelating agents (e.g., EDTA),
inert gases and the like may also be provided in the pharmaceutical carriers. The present invention is not limited by
the selection of the carrier. The preparation of these pharmaceutically acceptable compositions, from the above
described components, having appropriate pH isotonicity, stability and other conventional characteristics is within
the skill of the art. See, e.g., texts such as Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th ed, Lippincott
Williams & Wilkins, pub!., 2000; and The Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 4.sup.th edit., eds. R. C. Rowe
et al, APhA Publications, 2003.
          A "therapeutically effective amount" (or "effective amount") refers to an amount of an active ingredient,
e.g., an agent according to the invention, sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results when administered to a
subject or patient. An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations, applications or dosages.
A therapeutically effective amount of a composition according to the invention may be readily determined by one of
ordinary skill in the art. In the context of this invention, a "therapeutically effective amount" is one that produces an
objectively measured change in one or more parameters associated NGF related condition sufficient to effect
beneficial or desired results including clinical results such as alleviation or reduction in pain sensation. An effective
amount can be administered in one or more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an effective amount of
drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to treat, ameliorate, reduce the intensity of
and/or prevent pain, including post-surgical pain, rheumatoid arthritis pain, and/or osteoarthritis pain. In some
embodiments, the "effective amount" may reduce pain at rest (resting pain) or mechanically- induced pain (including
pain following movement), or both, and it may be administered before, during or after a painful stimulus. As is
understood in the clinical context, an effective amount of a drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition may or
may not be achieved in conjunction with another drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an
"effective amount" may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single
agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a
desirable result may be or is achieved. Of course, the therapeutically effective amount will vary depending upon the
particular subject and condition being treated, the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the condition, the
particular compound chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, timing of administration, the manner of
administration and the like, all of which can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.
          As used herein, the term "therapeutic" encompasses the full spectrum of treatments for a disease, condition
or disorder. A "therapeutic" agent of the invention may act in a manner that is prophylactic or preventive, including
those that incorporate procedures designed            to target animals    that can be identified as being          at risk
                                                             27

(pharmacogenetics); or in a manner that is ameliorative or curative in nature; or may act to slow the rate or extent of
the progression of at least one symptom of a disease or disorder being treated.
           In a further aspect, the invention features veterinary compositions in which antibodies of the present
invention are provided for therapeutic or prophylactic uses. The invention features a method for treating a dog
subject having a particular antigen, for example., one associated with a disease or condition. The method includes
administering a therapeutically effective amount of a recombinant antibody specific for the particular antigen, with
the recombinant antibody described herein.
           The amount of antibody useful to produce a therapeutic effect can be determined by standard techniques
well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The antibodies will generally be provided by standard technique
within a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer, and may be administered by any desired route. The route of
administration of the antibody or antigen-binding moiety of the invention may be oral, parenteral, by inhalation or
topical. In a preferred embodiment the route of administration is parenteral. The term parenteral as used herein
includes intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, rectal, vaginal or intraperitoneal administration.
           "Pain" as used herein refers to pain of any etiology, including acute and chronic pain, and any pain with an
inflammatory component. Examples of pain include including inflammatory pain, post-operative incision pain,
neuropathic pain, fracture pain, osteoporotic fracture pain, post-herpetic neuralgia, cancer pain, pain resulting from
bums, pain associated with bum or wound, pain associated with trauma (including traumatic head injury),
neuropathic pain, pain associated with musculoskeletal disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis,
ankylosing spondylitis, seronegative (non-rheumatoid) arthropathies, non-articular rheumatism and periarticular
disorders, and pain associated with cancer (including "break-through pain" and pain associated with terminal
cancer), peripheral neuropathy and post-herpetic neuralgia.
           As used herein, "treatment" is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired clinical results. For purposes
of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:
improvement or alleviation of any aspect of pain, including acute, chronic, inflammatory, neuropathic, post-surgical
pain, rheumatoid arthritis pain, or osteoarthritis pain. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical
results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: including lessening severity, alleviation of one
or more symptoms associated with pain including any aspect of pain (such as shortening duration of pain, reduction
of pain sensitivity or sensation).
           NGF Related Disorder, as described herein, refers to a disorder including cardiovascular diseases,
atherosclerosis, obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, pain and inflammation. In some embodiments of the
present invention an NGF related disorder refers to pain, in particular chronic pain, inflammatory pain, post
operative incision pain, neuropathic pain, fracture pain, osteoporotic fracture pain, post-herpetic neuralgia, cancer
pain, pain resulting from bums, pain associated with bum or wound, pain associated with trauma (including
traumatic head injury), neuropathic pain, pain associated with musculoskeletal disorders such as rheumatoid
arthritis,   osteoarthritis, ankylosing    spondylitis,  seronegative   (non-rheumatoid)    arthropathies,  non-articular
rheumatism and periarticular disorders, and pain associated with cancer (including "break-through pain" and pain
associated with terminal cancer), peripheral neuropathy and post-herpetic neuralgia.
                                                             28

           "Reducing incidence" of pain means any of reducing severity (which can include reducing need for and/or
amount of (e.g., exposure to) other drugs and/or therapies generally used for this conditions, including, for example,
opiates), duration, and/or frequency (including, for example, delaying or increasing time to post-surgical pain in an
individual). As is understood by those skilled in the art, individuals may vary in terms of their response to treatment,
and, as such, for example, a "method of reducing incidence of rheumatoid arthritis pain or osteoarthritis pain in an
individual" reflects administering the anti-NGF antagonist antibody based on a reasonable expectation that such
administration may likely cause such a reduction in incidence in that particular individual.
           "Ameliorating" a pain or one or more symptoms of a pain (such as rheumatoid arthritis pain or
osteoarthritis pain) means a lessening or improvement of one or more symptoms of a pain as compared to not
administering an anti-NGF antagonist antibody. "Ameliorating" also includes shortening or reduction in duration of
a symptom.
           "Palliating" a pain or one or more symptoms of a pain (such as rheumatoid arthritis pain or osteoarthritis
pain) means lessening the extent of one or more undesirable clinical manifestations of post-surgical pain in an
individual or population of individuals treated with an anti-NGF antagonist antibody in accordance with the
invention.
          As used therein, "delaying" the development of pain means to defer, hinder, slow, retard, stabilize, and/or
postpone progression of pain, such as post-surgical pain, rheumatoid arthritis pain, or osteoarthritis pain. This delay
can be of varying lengths of time, depending on the history of the disease and/or individuals being treated. As is
evident to one skilled in the art, a sufficient or significant delay can, in effect, encompass prevention, in that the
individual does not develop pain. A method that "delays" development of the symptom is a method that reduces
probability of developing the symptom in a given time frame and/or reduces extent of the symptoms in a given time
frame, when compared to not using the method. Such comparisons are typically based on clinical studies, using a
statistically significant number of subjects.
           "Post-surgical pain" (interchangeably termed "post-incisional" or "post-traumatic pain") refers to pain
arising or resulting from an external trauma such as a cut, puncture, incision, tear, or wound into tissue of an
individual (including that that arises from all surgical procedures, whether invasive or non-invasive). As used herein,
post-surgical pain does not include pain that occurs (arises or originates) without an external physical trauma. In
some embodiments, post-surgical pain is internal or external (including peripheral) pain, and the wound, cut, trauma,
tear or incision may occur accidentally (as with a traumatic wound) or deliberately (as with a surgical incision). As
used herein, "pain" includes nociception and the sensation of pain, and pain can be assessed objectively and
subjectively, using pain scores and other methods well-known in the art. Post-surgical pain, as used herein, includes
allodynia (i.e., increased response to a normally non-noxious stimulus) and hyperalgesia (i.e., increased response to
a normally noxious or unpleasant stimulus), which can in turn, be thermal or mechanical (tactile) in nature. In some
embodiments, the pain is characterized by thermal sensitivity, mechanical sensitivity and/or resting pain. In some
embodiments, the post-surgical pain comprises mechanically-induced pain or resting pain. In other embodiments,
the post-surgical pain comprises resting pain. The pain can be primary or secondary pain, as is well-known in the
art.

invention, the preferred methods and materials are now described. All publications mentioned herein are

          The invention disclosed herein concerns antibodies, which is used interchangeably with the term "antigen
binding protein" as described herein, that specifically bind to Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and in particular
antibodies, whether it be canine antibodies produced by hybridoma or phage display technology or fully "caninized"
monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to canine NGF and thus prevent canine NGF from binding to canine
TrkA and to a lesser extent canine p75 receptors, thus serving as an antagonist in that the signaling pathway is
prevented from being activated by NGF.
          NGF was the first neurotrophin to be identified, and its role in the development and survival of both
peripheral and central neurons has been well characterized. NGF has been shown to be a critical survival and
maintenance factor in the development of peripheral sympathetic and embryonic sensory neurons and of basal
forebrain cholinergic neurons (Smeyne et al. (1994) Nature 368:246-249; Crowley et al. (1994) Cell 76:1001-1011).
NGF upregulates expression of neuropeptides in sensory neurons (Lindsay et al. (1989) Nature 337:362-364) and its
activity is mediated through two different membrane-bound receptors, the TrkA receptor and what is considered the
low affinity p75 common neurotrophin receptor.
          NGF has been shown to be elevated in NGF related disorders in which an elevated amount of NGF is
present in injured or diseased tissues. An NGF related disorder, can be defined as an increase in pain due to the
elevation of NGF in an injured, diseased or damaged tissue. Pain, as used herein, is defined as described herein,
refers to a disorder including chronic pain, inflammatory pain, post-operative incision pain, neuropathic pain,
fracture pain, osteoporotic fracture pain, post-herpetic neuralgia, cancer pain, pain resulting from bums, pain
associated with burn or wound, pain associated with trauma (including traumatic head injury), neuropathic pain,
pain associated with musculoskeletal disorders such as chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing
spondylitis, seronegative (non-rheumatoid) arthropathies, non-articular rheumatism and periarticular disorders, and
pain associated with cancer (including "break-through pain" and pain associated with terminal cancer), peripheral
neuropathy and post-herpetic neuralgia.
          In an embodiment of the present invention, an NGF disorder is defined as osteoarthritis in canines.
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a slowly-progressive degenerative joint disease characterized by a loss of joint cartilage and
the subsequent exposure of subchondral bone in canines. This eventually results in a self-perpetuating insidious
disorder characterized by joint pain. New bone formation occurs in response to the chronic inflammation, and local
tissue damage in an attempt to limit both movement and pain. Macroscopically, there is loss of joint cartilage, a
                                                           30

narrowing of the joint space, sclerosis of subchondral bone, and the production of joint osteophytes (Veterinary
Focus: Vol 17 No 3 ; 2007)
          In canines, the onset of primary OA depends on breed. The onset mean age is 3.5 years in Rottweilers and
9.5 years in Poodles for examples, with a wide range of onset for other breeds as well as mixed breeds. The
developmental orthopedic diseases and associated osteoarthritis are the most common articular diseases in dogs,
they account for some 70% of medical visits for articular disease and related problems within the appendicular
skeleton. Twenty two percent of cases were dogs aged one year or under. The incidence of OA is increased by
trauma as well as obesity, aging and genetic abnormalities. In particular, age can be a factor in OA incidence
wherein >50% of arthritis cases are observed in dogs aged between 8-13 years. The musculoskeletal diseases are
very common in geriatric patients, and nearly 20% of elderly dogs show orthopedic disorders. In Labrador
Retrievers aged >8 years, OA in several joints (elbow, shoulder, hip, knee) is typical. Additionally the size of the
canine plays a role in OA onset as well. 45% of dogs with arthritis are large breed dogs. Among these, >50% are
giant breed dogs, while only 28% are medium breed dogs and 27% are small breed dogs. The need for
pharmaceutical intervention for the alleviation of OA pain in canines is very high.
          As stated herein, elevated levels of NGF are indicative of a NGF related disorder, particularly in OA.
Elevated levels of NGF have been reported in transgenic arthritic mice along with an increase in the number of mast
cells (Aloe, et al., Int. J. Tissue Reactions-Exp. Clin. Aspects 15:139-143 (1993)). PCT Publication No. WO
02/096458 discloses use of anti NGF antibodies of certain properties in treating various NGF related disorders such
as inflammatory condition (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). It has been reported that a purified anti-NGF antibody
injected into arthritic transgenic mice carrying the human tumor necrosis factor gene caused reduction in the number
of mast cells, as well as a decrease in histamine and substance P levels within the synovium of arthritis mice (Aloe
et al., Rheumatol. Int. 14: 249-252 (1995)). It has been shown that exogenous administration of an NGF antibody
reduced the enhanced level of TNFgoccurring in ar thritic mice (Marmi et al., Rheumatol. Int. 18: 97-102 (1998)).
Rodent anti-NGF antagonist antibodies have been reported. See, e.g., Hongo et al., Hybridoma (2000) 19(3): 215
227; Ruberti et al. (1993) Cell. Molec. Neurobiol. 13(5): 559-568. However, when rodent antibodies are used
therapeutically in non-murine mammals, an anti-murine antibody response develops in significant numbers of
treated individuals. Thus, there is a serious need for anti-NGF antagonist antigen binding proteins, including anti
NGF antagonist antibodies of the present invention for canine use particularly for use in treating OA.
          While the properties of antibodies make them very attractive therapeutic agents, there are a number of
limitations. The vast majority of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are of rodent origin, as previously noted. When such
antibodies are administered in a different species, patients can mount their own antibody response to such xenogenic
antibodies. Such response may result in the eventual neutralization and elimination of the antibody. As described
above mice are used extensively in the production of monoclonal antibodies. One problem in the use of using
antibodies produced by a particular species, generally initially in the mouse, is that a non-murine subjects being
treated with said antibodies react to the mouse antibodies as if they were a foreign substance thus creating a new set
of antibodies to the mouse antibodies. Mouse antibodies are "seen" by the non-murine, for example canine, immune
system as foreign, and the subject then mounts an immune response against the molecule. Those skilled in the field
will recognize the need to be able to treat a subject with an antigen specific antibody, but have that antibody species
                                                           31

specific. Part of the reaction generated from cross species antibody administration, for example a mouse monoclonal
antibody being administered to a canine, can range from a mild form, like a rash, to a more extreme and life
threatening response, such as renal failure. This immune response can also decrease the effectiveness of the
treatment, or create a future reaction if the subject is given a subsequent treatment containing mouse antibodies.
Accordingly, we set forth to overcome this disadvantage by "caninization" of an antibody. In particular, this process
focuses on the framework regions of the immunoglobulin variable domain, but could also include the compliment
determinant regions (CDR's) of the variable domain. The enabling steps and reduction to practice for this process are
described in this disclosure.
          The process of modifying a monoclonal antibody from an animal to render it less immunogenic for
therapeutic administration to species has been aggressively pursued and has been described in a number of
publications (e.g. Antibody Engineering: A practical Guide. Carl A. K. Borrebaeck ed. W.H. Freeman and
Company, 1992). However, this process has not been applied for the development of therapeutic or diagnostics for
non-humans, particularly canines, until recently. In fact, very little has been published with regard to canine variable
domains at all. Wasserman and Capra, Biochem.          6, 3160 (1977), determined the amino acid sequence of the
variable regions of both a canine IgM and a canine IgA heavy chain. Wasserman and Capra, Immunochem. 15, 303
(1978), determined the amino acid sequence of the K light chain from a canine IgA. McCumber and Capra, Mol.
Immunol. 16, 565 (1979), disclose the complete amino-acid sequence of a canine mu chain. Tang et al., Vet.
Immunology Immunopathology 80, 259 (2001), discloses a single canine IgG-A y chain cDNA and four canine IgG
A y chain protein sequences. It describes PCR amplification of a canine spleen cDNA library with a degenerate
oligonucleotide primer designed from the conserved regions of human, mouse, pig, and bovine IgGs. The paucity of
information available on canine antibodies has prevented their development as therapeutics for the treatment canine
disease.
          These noted limitations have prompted the development of engineering technologies known as "speciation"
and is well known to those in the art in terms of "humanization" of therapeutic antibodies. Humanized antibodies
can be generated as chimeric antibodies or fragments thereof which contain minimal sequence derived from non
human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human antibodies (i.e. "recipient antibody" or
"target species antibody") in which residues from a complementarity determining region (CDR) of the recipient are
replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (i.e. "donor antibody" or "originating species antibody")
such as mouse, having the desired. properties such as specificity, affinity, and potency. In some instances,
framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues.
This humanization strategy is referred to as "CDR grafting" as reported for the making of humanized antibodies
(Winter, U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539). Back mutation of selected target framework residues to the corresponding donor
residues might be required to restore and or improved affinity. Structure-based methods may also be employed for
humanization and affinity maturation, for example as described for humanization in U.S. Patent Application Ser.
No. 10/153,159 and related applications. Comparison of the essential framework residues required in humanization
of several antibodies, as well as computer modeling based on antibody crystal structures revealed a set of framework
residues termed as "Vernier zone residues" (Foote, J. Mol. Biol. 224:487-499 (1992)). In addition, several residues
in the VH-VL interface zone -have been suggested to be important in maintaining affinity for the antigen (Santos,
                                                           32

Prog Nucleic Acid Res Mol Biol. 60: 169-94 (1998); Kettleborough, et al., Protein Engin., 4:773-783 (1991)).
Similar strategies for "caninization" of antibodies for use in dogs are described in US 7,261,890.
           Alternatively, humanized antibodies may contain the CDRs from a non-human sequence grafted into pools
(e.g. libraries) of individual human framework regions. This newly engineered antibody is able to bind to the same
antigen as the original antibody. The antibody constant region is derived from a human antibody. The methodology
for performing this aspect is generally described as framework shuffling (Dall'Acqua, Methods, 36:43-60 (2005)).
Furthermore, the humanized antibody may contain sequences from two or more framework regions derived from at
least two human antibody germline sequences with high homology to the donor species. Antibodies designed using
this method are described as hybrid antibodies (Rother et aT., U.S. Pat. No. 7,393,648) and may be applicable to
speciation outside of humanization, for example for caninization.
           The approaches described above utilize essentially entire framework regions from one or more antibody
variable heavy chains or variable light chains of the target species which are engineered to receive CDRs from the
donor species. In some cases, back mutation of selected residues in the variable region is used to enhance
presentation of the CDRs. Designing antibodies that minimize immunogenic reaction in a subject to non-native
sequences in the antibody, while at the same time preserving antigen binding regions of the antibody sufficiently to
maintain efficacy, has proven challenging.
           Another challenge for developing therapeutic antibodies targeting proteins is that epitopes on the
homologous protein in a different species are frequently different, and the potential for cross-reactivity with other
proteins is also different. As a consequence, antibodies have to be made, tested and developed for the specific target
in the particular species to be treated.
           Antibodies target an antigen through its binding of a specific epitope on an antigen by the interaction with
the variable region of the antibody molecule. Furthermore, antibodies have the ability to mediate, inhibit (as in the
case of the antagonistic anti-NGF antigen binding protein of the present invention) and/or initiate a variety of
biological activities. There are a wide range of functions for therapeutic antibodies, for example, antibodies can
modulate receptor-ligand interactions as agonists or antagonists. Antibody binding can initiate intracellular signaling
to stimulate cell growth, cytokine production, or apoptosis. Antibodies can deliver agents bound to the Fe region to
specific sites. Antibodies also elicit antibody-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-mediated cytotoxicity
(CDC), and phagocytosis. There are also antibodies that have been altered where the ADCC, CDC, Clq binding and
phagocytosis functions have been eliminated. In one embodiment of the present invention the antibody of the
present invention comprises alterations in the Fc region of the antibody that alters effector function of said antibody.
Caninization
           As used herein, "caninized antibody" means an antibody having an amino acid sequence corresponding to
that of an antibody produced by a canine and/or has been made using any of the techniques known in the art or
disclosed herein. This definition of a caninized antibody includes antibodies comprising at least one canine heavy
chain polypeptide or at least one canine light chain polypeptide. "Speciation", per se, of antibodies, and in particular
the humanization of antibodies is a field of study well known to one skilled in the art. It has been unknown until
recently whether the speciation of antibodies beyond humanization would yield a therapeutic antibody that could be
                                                            33

efficacious in any other species. The present invention exemplifies the caninization of an anti-NGF antibody for
therapeutic use in dogs.
          Chimeric antibodies comprise sequences from at least two different species. As one example, recombinant
cloning techniques may be used to include variable regions, which contain the antigen-binding sites, from a non
canine antibody (i.e., an antibody prepared in a non-canine species immunized with the antigen) and constant
regions derived from a canine immunoglobulin.
          Caninized antibodies are a type of chimeric antibody wherein variable region residues responsible for
antigen binding (i.e., residues of a complementarity determining region, abbreviated complementarity determining
region, or any other residues that participate in antigen binding) are derived from a non-canine species, while the
remaining variable region residues (i.e., residues of the framework regions) and constant regions are derived, at least
in part, from canine antibody sequences. A subset of framework region residues and constant region residues of a
caninized antibody may be derived from non-canine sources. Variable regions of a caninized antibody are also
described as caninized (i.e., a caninized light or heavy chain variable region). The non-canine species is typically
that used for immunization with antigen, such as mouse, rat, rabbit, non-human primate, or other non-canine
mammalian species.
          Complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are residues of antibody variable regions that participate in
antigen binding. Several numbering systems for identifying CDRs are in common use. The Kabat definition is based
on sequence variability, and the Clothia definition is based on the location of the structural loop regions. The AbM
definition is a compromise between the Kabat and Clothia approaches. A caninized antibody of the invention may
be constructed to comprise one or more CDRs. Still further, CDRs may be used separately or in combination in
synthetic molecules such as SMIPs and small antibody mimetics.
          Framework residues are those residues of antibody variable regions other than hypervariable or CDR
residues. Framework residues may be derived from a naturally occurring canine antibody, such as a canine
framework that is substantially similar to a framework region of the antibody of the invention. Artificial framework
sequences that represent a consensus among individual sequences may also be used. When selecting a framework
region for caninization, sequences that are widely represented in canines may be preferred over less populous
sequences. Additional mutations of the canine framework acceptor sequences may be made to restore murine
residues believed to be involved in antigen contacts and/or residues involved in the structural integrity of the
antigen-binding site, or to improve antibody expression.
          Grafting of CDRs is performed by replacing one or more CDRs of an acceptor antibody (e.g., a caninized
antibody or other antibody comprising desired framework residues) with CDRs of a donor antibody (e.g., a non
canine antibody). Acceptor antibodies may be selected based on similarity of framework residues between a
candidate acceptor antibody and a donor antibody. For example, canine framework regions are identified as having
substantial sequence homology to each framework region of the relevant non-canine antibody, and CDRs of the non
canine antibody are grafted onto the composite of the different canine framework regions.
          Analysis of the three-dimensional structures of antibody-antigen complexes, combined with analysis of the
available amino acid sequence data may be used to model sequence variability based on structural dissimilarity of
amino acid residues that occur at each position within the CDR. CDRs of the present invention can also be utilized
                                                            34

in small antibody mimetics, which comprise two CDR regions and a framework region (Qui et al. Nature
Biotechnology Vol 25;921-929; August 2007).
          Acceptor frameworks for grafting of CDRs or abbreviated CDRs may be further modified to introduce
desired residues. For example, acceptor frameworks may comprise a heavy chain variable region of a canine
consensus sequence, optionally with non-canine donor residues at one or more of positions. Following grafting,
additional changes may be made in the donor and/or acceptor sequences to optimize antibody binding and
functionality. See e.g., International Publication No. WO 91/09967.
          The present invention further provides cells and cell lines expressing antibodies of the invention.
Representative host cells include bacterial, yeast, mammalian and human cells, such as CHO cells, HEK-293 cells,
HeLa cells, CV-1 cells, and COS cells. Methods for generating a stable cell line following transformation of a
heterologous construct into a host cell are known in the art. Representative non-mammalian host cells include insect
cells (Potter et al. (1993) Int. Rev. Immunol. 10(2-3):103-112). Antibodies may also be produced in transgenic
animals (Houdebine (2002) Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 13(6):625-629) and transgenic plants (Schillberg et al. (2003)
Cell Mol. Life Sci. 60(3):433-45).
          As discussed above, monoclonal, chimeric and caninized antibodies, which have been modified by, e.g.,
deleting, adding, or substituting other portions of the antibody, e.g., the constant region, are also within the scope of
the invention. For example, an antibody can be modified as follows: (i) by deleting the constant region; (ii) by
replacing the constant region with another constant region, e.g., a constant region meant to increase half-life,
stability or affinity of the antibody, or a constant region from another species or antibody class; or (iii) by modifying
one or more amino acids in the constant region to alter, for example, the number of glycosylation sites, effector cell
function, Fc receptor (FcR) binding, complement fixation, among others. In one embodiment of the present
invention the antibody of the invention comprises an altered Fc region that alters effector function of the antibody.
          Methods for altering an antibody constant region are known in the art. Antibodies with altered function,
e.g. altered affinity for an effector ligand, such as FcR on a cell, or the Cl component of complement can be
produced by replacing at least one amino acid residue in the constant portion of the antibody with a different residue
(see e.g., EP 388,151 Al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,260, the contents of all of which are
hereby incorporated by reference).
          For example, it is possible to alter the affinity of an Fc region of an antibody for an FcR (e.g.,
Fc.gamma.R1), or for Clq binding by replacing the specified residue(s) with a residue(s) having an appropriate
functionality on its side chain, or by introducing a charged functional group, such as glutamate or aspartate, or
perhaps an aromatic non-polar residue such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan or alanine (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No.
5,624,821). The antibody or binding fragment thereof may be conjugated with a cytotoxin, a therapeutic agent, or a
radioactive metal ion. In one embodiment, the protein that is conjugated is an antibody or fragment thereof. A
cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells. Non-limiting examples include,
calicheamicin, taxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide,
vincristine,   vinblastine,   colchicin,   doxorubicin,   daunorubicin,   dihydroxy   anthracin    dione,   mitoxantrone,
mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol,
puromycin, and analogs, or homologs thereof. Therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, antimetabolites
                                                             35

(e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, and 5-fluorouracil decarbazine), alkylating agents
(e.g.,  mechlorethamine,    thioepa   chlorambucil,     melphalan,   carmustine    (BSNU)     and   lomustine   (CCNU),
cyclothosphamide, busulfan, dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II)
(DDP), cisplatin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin and doxorubicin), antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin, bleomycin,
mithramycin, and anthramycin), and anti-mitotic agents (e.g.,           vincristine and vinblastine). Techniques for
conjugating such moieties to proteins are well known in the art.
Compositions, Derived Compositions, and Methods of Making the Compositions
          This invention encompasses compositions, including pharmaceutical compositions, comprising antibodies,
polypeptides and polynucleotides comprising sequences encoding antibodies or polypeptides of the invention.
          As used herein, compositions comprise one or more antibodies, antigen binding proteins or polypeptides
(which may or may not be an antibody) that bind to canine NGF, and/or one or more polynucleotides comprising
sequences encoding one or more antibodies or polypeptides that bind to NGF. These compositions may further
comprise suitable excipients, such as pharmaceutically acceptable excipients including buffers, which are well
known in the art. The invention also encompasses isolated antibody, polypeptide and polynucleotide embodiments.
The invention also encompasses substantially pure antibody, polypeptide and polynucleotide embodiments.
          In some embodiments, the present invention provides for novel caninized monoclonal antibodies that
specifically bind to canine NGF. In one embodiment, a monoclonal antibody of the invention binds to NGF and
prevents its binding to, and activation of, its receptors Trk A and to a lesser extent p75, thus preventing the signaling
cascade as described herein. The monoclonal antibodies of the present invention are identified herein as "SM57",
"SM58", "SM66", "CanE3M65-12" and "CANSSM-QC23-VL/CANSSM5 7-VH" (" SSMQC23HCLC")
          In one or more embodiments, the present invention provides an isolated caninized antigen binding protein
wherein the variable light chain comprises SEQ ID NO. 16 (CAN-E3M-VL) and the variable heavy chain comprises
SEQ ID NO. 17 (CAN-N2G9-VH).
          In one or more embodiments, the present invention provides an isolated caninized antigen binding protein
comprising a variable light chain comprising SEQ ID NO. 26 (CAN-SSME3M-VL) and the variable heavy chain
comprising SEQ ID NO. 27 (CAN-SSM57-VH).
          In one or more embodiments, the present invention provides an isolated caninized antigen binding protein
comprising a variable light chain comprising SEQ ID NO. 30 (CAN-QC23-VL)                    and a variable heavy chain
comprising SEQ ID NO. 27 (CAN-SSM57-VH).
          A further embodiment of the invention provides the nucleic acids that encode the various antigen binding
proteins as previously described.
          The present invention provides for recombinant monoclonal antibodies and peptides and their uses in
clinical administrations and scientific procedures, including diagnostic procedures. With the advent of methods of
molecular biology and recombinant technology, it is possible to produce antibody and antibody-like molecules by
recombinant means and thereby generate gene sequences that code for specific amino acid sequences found in the
polypeptide structure of the antibodies. Such antibodies can be produced by either cloning the gene sequences
encoding the polypeptide chains of said antibodies or by direct synthesis of said polypeptide chains, with assembly
                                                            36

of the synthesized chains to form active tetrameric (H2L2) structures with affinity for specific epitopes and antigenic
determinants. This has permitted the ready production of antibodies having sequences characteristic of neutralizing
antibodies from different species and sources.
          Regardless of the source of the antibodies, or how they are recombinantly constructed, or how they are
synthesized, in vitro or in vivo, using transgenic animals, large cell cultures of laboratory or commercial size, using
transgenic plants, or by direct chemical synthesis employing no living organisms at any stage of the process, all
antibodies have a similar overall 3 dimensional structure. This structure is often given as H2L2 and refers to the fact
that antibodies commonly comprise two light (L) amino acid chains and 2 heavy (H) amino acid chains. Both chains
have regions capable of interacting with a structurally complementary antigenic target. The regions interacting with
the target are referred to as "variable" or 'V' regions and are characterized by differences in amino acid sequence
from antibodies of different antigenic specificity. The variable regions of either H or L chains contain the amino acid
sequences capable of specifically binding to antigenic targets.
          As used herein, the term "antigen binding region" refers to that portion of an antibody molecule which
contains the amino acid residues that interact with an antigen and confer on the antibody its specificity and affinity
for the antigen. The antibody binding region includes the "framework" amino acid residues necessary to maintain the
proper conformation of the antigen-binding residues. Within the variable regions of the H or L chains that provide
for the antigen binding regions are smaller sequences dubbed "hypervariable" because of their extreme variability
between antibodies of differing specificity. Such hypervariable regions are also referred to as "complementarity
determining regions" or "CDR" regions. These CDR regions account for the basic specificity of the antibody for a
particular antigenic determinant structure.
          The CDRs represent non-contiguous stretches of amino acids within the variable regions but, regardless of
species, the positional locations of these critical amino acid sequences within the variable heavy and light chain
regions have been found to have similar locations within the amino acid sequences of the variable chains. The
variable heavy and light chains of all antibodies each have three CDR regions, each non-contiguous with the others.
In all mammalian species, antibody peptides contain constant (i.e., highly conserved) and variable regions, and,
within the latter, there are the CDRs and the so-called "framework regions" made up of amino acid sequences within
the variable region of the heavy or light chain but outside the CDRs.
          The present invention further provides a vector including at least one of the nucleic acids described above.
Because the genetic code is degenerate, more than one codon can be used to encode a particular amino acid. Using
the genetic code, one or more different nucleotide sequences can be identified, each of which would be capable of
encoding the amino acid. The probability that a particular oligonucleotide will, in fact, constitute the actual encoding
sequence can be estimated by considering abnormal base pairing relationships and the frequency with which a
particular codon is actually used (to encode a particular amino acid) in eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells expressing an
anti-NGF antibody or portion. Such "codon usage rules" are disclosed by Lathe, et aT., 183 J. Molec. Biol. 1-12
(1985). Using the "codon usage rules" of Lathe, a single nucleotide sequence, or a set of nucleotide sequences that
contains a theoretical "most probable" nucleotide sequence capable of encoding anti-NGF sequences can be
identified. It is also intended that the antibody coding regions for use in the present invention could also be provided
by altering existing antibody genes using standard molecular biological techniques that result in variants (agonists)

of the antibodies and peptides described herein. Such variants include, but are not limited to deletions, additions and
substitutions in the amino acid sequence of the anti-NGF antibodies or peptides.
          For example, one class of substitutions is conservative amino acid substitutions. Such substitutions are
those that substitute a given amino acid in an anti-NGF antibody peptide by another amino acid of like
characteristics. Typically seen as conservative substitutions are the replacements, one for another, among the
aliphatic amino acids Ala, Val, Leu, and lie; interchange of the hydroxyl residues Ser and Thr, exchange of the
acidic residues Asp and Glu, substitution between the amide residues Asn and Gin, exchange of the basic residues
Lys and Arg, replacements among the aromatic residues Phe, Tyr, and the like. Guidance concerning which amino
acid changes are likely to be phenotypically silent is found in Bowie et aT., 247 Science 1306-10 (1990).
          Variant or agonist anti-NGF antibodies or peptides may be fully functional or may lack function in one or
more activities. Fully functional variants typically contain only conservative variations or variations in non-critical
residues or in non-critical regions. Functional variants can also contain substitution of similar amino acids that result
in no change or an insignificant change in function. Alternatively, such substitutions may positively or negatively
affect function to some degree. Non-functional variants typically contain one or more non-conservative amino acid
substitutions, deletions, insertions, inversions, or truncation or a substitution, insertion, inversion, or deletion in a
critical residue or critical region.
          Amino acids that are essential for function can be identified by methods known in the art, such as site
directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Cunningham et aT., 244 Science 1081-85 (1989). The latter
procedure introduces single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are
then tested for biological activity such as epitope binding or in vitro ADCC activity. Sites that are critical for ligand
receptor binding can also be determined by structural analysis such as crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance,
or photoaffinity labeling. Smith et aT., 224 J. Mol. Biol. 899-904 (1992); de Vos et aT., 255 Science 306-12 (1992).
          Moreover, polypeptides often contain amino acids other than the twenty "naturally occurring" amino acids.
Further, many amino acids, including the terminal amino acids, may be modified by natural processes, such as
processing and other post-translational modifications, or by chemical modification techniques well known in the art.
Known modifications include, but are not limited to, acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent
attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide
derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross
linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent crosslinks, formation of cystine,
formation     of pyroglutamate,      formylation,   gamma     carboxylation,   glycosylation,  GPI    anchor   formation,
hydroxylation,    iodination,    methylation,   myristoylation,  oxidation, proteolytic    processing, phosphorylation,
prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such
as arginylation, and ubiquitination. Such modifications are well known to those of skill in the art and have been
described in great detail in the scientific literature. Several particularly common modifications, glycosylation, lipid
attachment, sulfation, gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, hydroxylation and ADP ribosylation, for
instance, are described in most basic texts, such as Proteins-Structure and Molecular Properties (2nd ed., T. E.
Creighton, W.H. Freeman & Co., NY, 1993). Many detailed reviews are available on this subject, such as by Wold,
                                                             38

          Accordingly, the antibodies and peptides of the present invention also encompass derivatives or analogs in
which a substituted amino acid residue is not one encoded by the genetic code. Similarly, the additions and
substitutions in the amino acid sequence as well as variations, and modifications just described may be equally
applicable to the amino acid sequence of the NGF antigen and/or epitope or peptides thereof, and are thus
encompassed by the present invention. As mentioned above, the genes encoding a monoclonal antibody according to
the present invention is specifically effective in the recognition of NGF.
Antibody Derivatives
          Included within the scope of this invention are antibody derivatives. A "derivative" of an antibody contains
additional chemical moieties not normally a part of the protein. Covalent modifications of the protein are included
within the scope of this invention. Such modifications may be introduced into the molecule by reacting targeted
amino acid residues of the antibody with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side
chains or terminal residues. For example, derivatization with bifunctional agents, well-known in the art, is useful for
cross-linking the antibody or fragment to a water-insoluble support matrix or to other macromolecular carriers.
          Derivatives also include radioactively labeled monoclonal antibodies that are labeled. For example, with
radioactive iodine (251,1311), carbon (4C), sulfur (35S), indium, tritium (H3) or the like; conjugates of monoclonal
antibodies with biotin or avidin, with enzymes, such as horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-D
galactosidase, glucose oxidase, glucoamylase, carboxylic acid anhydrase, acetylcholine esterase, lysozyme, malate
dehydrogenase or glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase; and also conjugates of monoclonal antibodies with
bioluminescent agents (such as luciferase), chemoluminescent agents (such as acridine esters) or fluorescent agents
(such as phycobiliproteins).
          Another derivative bifunctional antibody of the present invention is a bispecific antibody, generated by
combining parts of two separate antibodies that recognize two different antigenic groups. This may be achieved by
crosslinking or recombinant techniques. Additionally, moieties may be added to the antibody or a portion thereof to
increase half-life in vivo (e.g., by lengthening the time to clearance from the blood stream. Such techniques include,
for example, adding PEG moieties (also termed pegilation), and are well-known in the art. See U.S. Patent. Appl.
Pub. No. 20030031671.
Recombinant Expression of Antibodies
In some embodiments, the nucleic acids encoding a subject monoclonal antibody are introduced directly into a host
cell, and the cell is incubated under conditions sufficient to induce expression of the encoded antibody. After the
subject nucleic acids have been introduced into a cell, the cell is typically incubated, normally at 370 C, sometimes
under selection, for a period of about 1-24 hours in order to allow for the expression of the antibody. In one
embodiment, the antibody is secreted into the supernatant of the media in which the cell is growing. Traditionally,
monoclonal antibodies have been produced as native molecules in marine hybridoma lines. In addition to that
technology, the present invention provides for recombinant DNA expression of monoclonal antibodies. This allows
                                                            39

the production of caninized antibodies, as well as a spectrum of antibody derivatives and fusion proteins in a host
species of choice.
          A nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one anti-NGF antibody, portion or polypeptide of the present
invention may be recombined with vector DNA in accordance with conventional techniques, including blunt-ended
or staggered-ended termini for ligation, restriction enzyme digestion to provide appropriate termini, filling in of
cohesive ends as appropriate, alkaline phosphatase treatment to avoid undesirable joining, and ligation with
appropriate ligases. Techniques for such manipulations are disclosed, e.g., by Maniatis et al., MOLECULAR
CLONING, LAB. MANUAL, (Cold Spring Harbor Lab. Press, NY, 1982 and 1989), and Ausubel et al. 1993 supra,
may be used to construct nucleic acid sequences which encode a monoclonal antibody molecule or antigen binding
region thereof.
          A nucleic acid molecule, such as DNA, is said to be "capable of expressing" a polypeptide if it contains
nucleotide sequences which contain transcriptional and translational regulatory information and such sequences are
"operably linked" to nucleotide sequences which encode the polypeptide. An operable linkage is a linkage in which
the regulatory DNA sequences and the DNA sequence sought to be expressed are connected in such a way as to
permit gene expression as anti-NGF peptides or antibody portions in recoverable amounts. The precise nature of the
regulatory regions needed for gene expression may vary from organism to organism, as is well known in the
analogous art. See, e.g., Sambrook et aT., 2001 supra; Ausubel et aT., 1993 supra.
          The present invention accordingly encompasses the expression of an anti-NGF antibody or peptide, in
either prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. Suitable hosts include bacterial or eukaryotic hosts including bacteria, yeast,
insects, fungi, bird and mammalian cells either in vivo, or in situ, or host cells of mammalian, insect, bird or yeast
origin. The mammalian cell or tissue may be of human, primate, hamster, rabbit, rodent, cow, pig, sheep, horse,
goat, dog or cat origin, but any other mammalian cell may be used.
          In one embodiment, the nucleotide sequence of the invention will be incorporated into a plasmid or viral
vector capable of autonomous replication in the recipient host. Any of a wide variety of vectors may be employed
for this purpose. See, e.g., Ausubel et aT., 1993 supra. Factors of importance in selecting a particular plasmid or viral
vector include: the ease with which recipient cells that contain the vector may be recognized and selected from those
recipient cells which do not contain the vector; the number of copies of the vector which are desired in a particular
host; and whether it is desirable to be able to "shuttle" the vector between host cells of different species.
          Example prokaryotic vectors known in the art include plasmids such as those capable of replication in .
coli (such as, for example, pBR322, CoIEl, pSC101, pACYC 184, .pi.vX). Such plasmids are, for example,
disclosed by Maniatis et aT., 1989 supra; Ausubel et al, 1993 supra. Bacillus plasmids include pC194, pC221 ,
pT127, etc. Such plasmids are disclosed by Gryczan, in THE MOLEC. BIO. OF THE BACILLI 307-329 (Academic
Press, NY, 1982). Suitable Streptomyces plasmids include plJ101 (Kendall et aI., 169 J. Bacteriol. 4177-83 (1987),
and Streptomyces bacteriophages         such as phLC31 (Chater et aT.,        in SIXTH INT'L SYMPOSIUM               ON
ACTINOMYCETALES BIO. 45-54 (Akademiai Kaido, Budapest, Hungary 1986). Pseudomonas plasmids are
reviewed in John et aT., 8 Rev. Infect. Dis. 693-704 (1986); lzaki, 33 Jpn. J. Bacteriol. 729-42 (1978); and Ausubel
et aT., 1993 supra.

          Alternatively, gene expression elements useful for the expression of cDNA encoding anti-NGF antibodies
or peptides include, but are not limited to (a) viral transcription promoters and their enhancer elements, such as the
SV40 early promoter (Okayama et aT., 3 Mol. Cell. Biol. 280 (1983), Rous sarcoma virus LTR (Gorman et aT., 79
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 6777 (1982), and Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR (Grosschedl et aT., 41 Cell 885
(1985); (b) splice regions and polyadenylation sites such as those derived from the SV40 late region (Okayarea et
aT., 1983), and (c) polyadenylation sites such as in SV40 (Okayama et aT., 1983).
          Immunoglobulin cDNA genes can be expressed as described by Weidle et aT., 51 Gene 21 (1987), using as
expression elements the SV40 early promoter and its enhancer, the mouse immunoglobulin H chain promoter
enhancers, SV40 late region mRNA splicing, rabbit S-globin intervening sequence, immunoglobulin and rabbit S
globin polyadenylation sites, and SV40 polyadenylation elements. For immunoglobulin genes comprised of part
cDNA, part genomic DNA (Whittle et aT., 1 Protein Engin. 499 (1987 , the transcriptional promoter can be human
cytomegalovirus, the promoter enhancers can be cytomegalovirus and mouse/human immunoglobulin, and mRNA
splicing and polyadenylation regions can be the native chromosomal immunoglobulin sequences.
          In one embodiment, for expression of cDNA genes in rodent cells, the transcriptional promoter is a viral
LTR sequence, the transcriptional promoter enhancers are either or both the mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain
enhancer and the viral LTR enhancer, the splice region contains an intron of greater than 31 bp, and the
polyadenylation and transcription termination regions are derived from the native chromosomal sequence
corresponding to the immunoglobulin chain being synthesized. In other embodiments, cDNA sequences encoding
other proteins are combined with the above-recited expression elements to achieve expression of the proteins in
mammalian cells.
          Each fused gene can be assembled in, or inserted into, an expression vector. Recipient cells capable of
expressing the chimeric immunoglobulin chain gene product are then transfected singly with an anti-NGF peptide or
chimeric H or chimeric L chain-encoding gene, or are co-transfected with a chimeric H and a chimeric L chain gene.
The transfected recipient cells are cultured under conditions that permit expression of the incorporated genes and the
expressed immunoglobulin chains or intact antibodies or fragments are recovered from the culture.
          In one embodiment, the fused genes encoding the anti-NGF peptide or chimeric H and L chains, or portions
thereof are assembled in separate expression vectors that are then used to cotransfect a recipient cell. Alternatively
the fused genes encoding the chimeric H and L chains can be assembled on the same expression vector. For
transfection of the expression vectors and production of the chimeric antibody, the recipient cell line may be a
myeloma cell. Myeloma cells can synthesize, assemble and secrete immunoglobulins encoded by transfected
immunoglobulin genes and possess the mechanism for glycosylation of the immunoglobulin. Myeloma cells can be
grown in culture or in the peritoneal cavity of a mouse, where secreted immunoglobulin can be obtained from ascites
fluid. Other suitable recipient cells include lymphoid cells such as B lymphocytes of human or nonhuman origin,
hybridoma cells of human or non-human origin, or interspecies heterohybridoma cells.
          The expression vector carrying a chimeric, caninized antibody construct or anti-NGF polypeptide of the
present invention can be introduced into an appropriate host cell by any of a variety of suitable means, including
such biochemical means as transformation, transfection, conjugation, protoplast fusion, calcium phosphate
precipitation, and application with polycations such as diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) dextran, and such mechanical
                                                            41

means as electroporation, direct microinjection, and microprojectile bombardment. Johnston et at, 240 Science 1538
(1988).
          Yeast can provide substantial advantages over bacteria for the production of immunoglobulin H and L
chains. Yeasts carry out post-translational peptide modifications including glycosylation. A number of recombinant
DNA strategies now exist which utilize strong promoter sequences and high copy number plasmids which can be
used for production of the desired proteins in yeast. Yeast recognizes leader sequences of cloned mammalian gene
products and secretes peptides bearing leader sequences (i.e., pre-peptides). Hitzman et aT., 11 th Int'l Conference on
Yeast, Genetics & Molec. Biol. (Montpelier, France, 1982).
          Yeast gene expression systems can be routinely evaluated for the levels of production, secretion and the
stability of anti-NGF peptides, antibody and assembled murine and chimeric, heterochimeric, caninized, antibodies,
fragments and regions thereof. Any of a series of yeast gene expression systems incorporating promoter and
termination elements from the actively expressed genes coding for glycolytic enzymes produced in large quantities
when yeasts are grown in media rich in glucose can be utilized. Known glycolytic genes can also provide very
efficient transcription control signals. For example, the promoter and terminator signals of the phosphoglycerate
kinase (PGK) gene can be utilized. A number of approaches can be taken for evaluating optimal expression plasmids
for the expression of cloned immunoglobulin cDNAs in yeast. See Vol. II DNA Cloning, 45-66, (Glover, ed.,) IRL
Press, Oxford, UK 1985).
          Bacterial strains can also be utilized as hosts for the production of antibody molecules or peptides described
by this invention. Plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from species
compatible with a host cell are used in connection with these bacterial hosts. The vector carries a replication site, as
well as specific genes which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. A number of
approaches can be taken for evaluating the expression plasmids for the production of murine, chimeric,
heterochimeric, caninized antibodies,        fragments and regions or antibody chains encoded by the cloned
immunoglobulin cDNAs in bacteria (see Glover, 1985 supra; Ausubel, 1993 supra; Sambrook, 2001 supra;
Colligan et aT., eds. Current Protocols in Immunology, John Wiley & Sons, NY, NY (1994-2001); Colligan et aT.,
eds. Current Protocols in Protein Science, John Wiley & Sons, NY, NY (1997-2001).
          Host mammalian cells may be grown in vitro or in vivo. Mammalian cells provide posttranslational
modifications to immunoglobulin protein molecules including leader peptide removal, folding and assembly of
Hand L chains, glycosylation of the antibody molecules, and secretion of functional antibody protein. Mammalian
cells which can be useful as hosts for the production of antibody proteins, in addition to the cells of lymphoid origin
described above, include cells of fibroblast origin, such as Vero (ATCC CRL 81) or CHO-Ki (ATCC CRL 61)
cells. Many vector systems are available for the expression of cloned anti-NGF peptides Hand L chain genes in
mammalian cells (see Glover, 1985 supra). Different approaches can be followed to obtain complete H2L2
antibodies. It is possible to co-express Hand L chains in the same cells to achieve intracellular association and
linkage of Hand L chains into complete tetrameric H2L2 antibodies and/or anti-NGF peptides. The co-expression
can occur by using either the same or different plasmids in the same host. Genes for both Hand L chains and/or anti
NGF peptides can be placed into the same plasmid, which is then transfected into cells, thereby selecting directly for
cells that express both chains. Alternatively, cells can be transfected first with a plasmid encoding one chain, for
                                                             42

example the L chain, followed by transfection of the resulting cell line with an H chain plasmid containing a second
selectable marker. cell lines producing anti-NGF peptides and/or H2L2 molecules via either route could be
transfected with plasmids encoding additional copies of peptides, H, L, or H plus L chains in conjunction with
additional selectable markers to generate cell lines with enhanced properties, such as higher production of assembled
H2L2 antibody molecules or enhanced stability of the transfected cell lines.
          For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant antibodies, stable expression may be used. For
example, cell lines, which stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered. Rather than using expression
vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with immunoglobulin expression
cassettes and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed
to grow for 1-2 days in enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the
recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into a
chromosome and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. Such engineered cell
lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds/components that interact directly or
indirectly with the antibody molecule.
          Once an antibody of the invention has been produced, it may be purified by any method known in the art
for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity,
particularly affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation,
differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. In many embodiments,
antibodies are secreted from the cell into culture medium and harvested from the culture medium.
Pharmaceutical and Veterinary Applications
          The anti-NGF antibodies or peptides of the present invention can be used for example in the treatment of
NGF related disorders in dogs. More specifically, the invention further provides for a pharmaceutical composition
comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent and, as active ingredient, an antibody or peptide
according to the invention. The antibody can be a chimeric, heterochimeric, caninized, or antibody according to the
present invention. Intact immunoglobulins or their binding fragments, such as Fab, are also envisioned. The
antibody and pharmaceutical compositions thereof of this invention are useful for parenteral administration, e.g.,
subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously.
          Anti-NGF antibodies and/or peptides of the present invention can be administered either as individual
therapeutic agents or in combination with other therapeutic agents. They can be administered alone, but are
generally administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and
standard pharmaceutical practice. Administration of the antibodies disclosed herein may be carried out by any
suitable means, including parenteral injection (such as intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular injection),
orally, or by topical administration of the antibodies (typically carried in a pharmaceutical formulation) to an airway
surface. Topical administration to an airway surface can be carried out by intranasal administration (e.g., by use of
dropper, swab, or inhaler). Topical administration of the antibodies to an airway surface can also be carried out by
inhalation administration, such as by creating respirable particles of a pharmaceutical formulation (including both
solid and liquid particles) containing the antibodies as an aerosol suspension, and then causing the subject to inhale
                                                           43

the respirable particles. Methods and apparatus for administering respirable particles of pharmaceutical formulations
are well known, and any conventional technique can be employed.
          In some desired embodiments, the antibodies are administered by parenteral injection. For parenteral
administration, anti-NGF antibodies or peptides can be formulated as a solution, suspension, emulsion or lyophilized
powder in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle. For example the vehicle may be a
solution of the antibody or a cocktail thereof dissolved in an acceptable carrier, such as an aqueous carrier such
vehicles are water, saline, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, trehalose or sucrose solution, or 5% serum albumin,
0.4% saline, 0.3% glycine and the like. Liposomes and nonaqueous vehicles such as fixed oils can also be used.
These solutions are sterile and generally free of particulate matter. These compositions may be sterilized by
conventional, well known sterilization techniques. The compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable
auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions such as pH adjusting and buffering agents,
toxicity adjustment agents and the like, for example sodium acetate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium
chloride, sodium lactate, etc. The concentration of antibody in these formulations can vary widely, for example from
less than about 0.5%, usually at or at least about 1% to as much as 15% or 20% by weight and will be selected
primarily based on fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected.
The vehicle or lyophilized powder can contain additives that maintain isotonicity (e.g., sodium chloride, mannitol)
and chemical stability (e.g., buffers and preservatives). The formulation is sterilized by commonly used techniques.
Actual methods for preparing parenterally administrable compositions will be known or apparent to those skilled in
the art and are described in more detail in, for example, REMINGTON'S PHARMA. SCI. (15th ed., Mack Pub. Co.,
Easton, Pa., 1980).
          The antibodies of this invention can be lyophilized for storage and reconstituted in a suitable carrier prior to
use. This technique has been shown to be effective with conventional immune globulins. Any suitable lyophilization
and reconstitution techniques can be employed. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that lyophilization
and reconstitution can lead to varying degrees of antibody activity loss and that use levels may have to be adjusted
to compensate. The compositions containing the present antibodies or a cocktail thereof can be administered for
prevention of recurrence and/or therapeutic treatments for existing disease. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are
described in the most recent edition of REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, a standard reference
text in this field of art. In therapeutic application, compositions are administered to a subject already suffering from
a disease, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest or alleviate the disease and its complications. An
amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as a "therapeutically effective dose" or a "therapeutically effective
amount". Amounts effective for this use will depend upon the severity of the disease and the general state of the
subject's own immune system, but generally range from about 0.1 mg antibody per kg body weight to about 10 mg
antibody per kg body weight, preferably about 0.3 mg antibody per kg of body weight to about 5 mg of antibody per
kg of body weight. In view of the minimization of extraneous substances and the lower probability of "foreign
substance" rejections which are achieved by the present canine-like and antibodies of this invention, it may be
possible to administer substantial excesses of these antibodies.
          The dosage administered will, of course, vary depending upon known factors such as the pharmacodynamic
characteristics of the particular agent, and its mode and route of administration; age, health, and weight of the
                                                            44

recipient; nature and extent of symptoms kind of concurrent treatment, frequency of treatment, and the effect
desired.
          As a non-limiting example, treatment of NGF-related pathologies in dogs can be provided as a biweekly or
monthly dosage of anti-NGF antibodies of the present invention in the dosage range described above. Example
antibodies for canine therapeutic use are high affinity (these may also be high avidity) antibodies, and fragments,
regions and derivatives thereof having potent in vivo anti-NGF activity, according to the present invention. Single or
multiple administrations of the compositions can be carried out with dose levels and pattern being selected by the
treating veterinarian. In any event, the pharmaceutical formulations should provide a quantity of the antibody(ies) of
this invention sufficient to effectively treat the subject.
Diagnostic Applications
          The present invention also provides the above anti-NGF antibodies and peptides for use in diagnostic
methods for detecting NGF in canines known to be or suspected of having an NGF related disorder. In an
embodiment of the invention the NGF related disorder is pain. In another embodiment the NGF related disorder is
osteoarthritis Anti-NGF antibodies and/or peptides of the present invention are useful for immunoassays which
detect or quantitate NGF, or anti-NGF antibodies, in a sample. An immunoassay for NGF typically comprises
incubating a clinical or biological sample in the presence of a detectably labeled high affinity (or high avidity) anti
NGF antibody or polypeptide of the present invention capable of selectively binding to NGF, and detecting the
labeled peptide or antibody which is bound in a sample. Various clinical assay procedures are well known in the art.
See, ex. IMMUNOASSAYS FOR THE 80'S (Voller et al., eds., Univ. Park, 1981). Such samples include tissue
biopsy, blood, serum, and fecal samples, or liquids collected from animal subjects and subjected to ELISA analysis
as described below. Thus, an anti-NGF antibody or polypeptide can be fixed to nitrocellulose, or another solid
support which is capable of immobilizing cells, cell particles or soluble proteins. The support can then be washed
with suitable buffers followed by treatment with the detectably labeled NGF specific peptide, antibody or antigen
binding protein. The solid phase support can then be washed with the buffer a second time to remove unbound
peptide or antibody. The amount of bound label on the solid support can then be detected by known method steps.
          "Solid phase support" or "carrier" refers to any support capable of binding peptide, antigen, or antibody.
Well-known supports or carriers, include glass, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinylidenefluoride
(PVDF), dextran, nylon, amylases, natural and modified celluloses, polyacrylamides, agaroses, and magnetite. The
nature of the carrier can be either soluble to some extent or insoluble for the purposes of the present invention. The
support material can have virtually any possible structural configuration so long as the coupled molecule is capable
of binding to NGF or an anti-NGF antibody. Thus, the support configuration can be spherical, as in a bead, or
cylindrical, as in the inside surface of a test tube, or the external surface of a rod. Alternatively, the surface can be
flat, such as a sheet, culture dish, test strip, etc. For example, supports may include polystyrene beads. Those skilled
in the art will know many other suitable carriers for binding antibody, peptide or antigen, or can ascertain the same
by routine experimentation. Well known method steps can determine binding activity of a given lot of anti-NGF
peptide and/or antibody or antigen binding protein. Those skilled in the art can determine operative and optimal
assay conditions by routine experimentation.

          Detectably labeling an NGF-specific peptide and/or antibody can be accomplished by linking to an enzyme
for use in an enzyme immunoassay (EIA), or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The linked enzyme
reacts with the exposed substrate to generate a chemical moiety which can be detected, for example, by
spectrophotometric, fluorometric or by visual means. Enzymes which can be used to detectably label the NGF
specific antibodies of the present invention include, but are not limited to, malate dehydrogenase, staphylococcal
nuclease, delta5-steroid isomerase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, triose
phosphate     isomerase,     horseradish peroxidase,        alkaline phosphatase,  asparaginase, glucose oxidase, beta
galactosidase,      ribonuclease,     urease,     catalase,    glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase,   glucoamylase       and
acetylcholinesterase. By radioactively labeling the NGF-specific antibodies, it is possible to detect NGF through the
use of a radioimmunoassay (RIA). See Work et al., LAB. TECHNIQUES & BIOCHEM. IN MOLEC. BIO(No.
Holland Pub. Co., NY, 1978). The radioactive isotope can be detected by such means as the use of a gamma counter
or a scintillation counter or by autoradiography. Isotopes which are particularly useful for the purpose of the present
                                              14
invention include:    3H, 125, 131, 35S, and     C.
          It is also possible to label the NGF-specific antibodies with a fluorescent compound. When the fluorescent
labeled antibody is exposed to light of the proper wave length, its presence can then be detected due to fluorescence.
Among the most commonly used fluorescent labeling compounds are fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine,
phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaldehyde and fluorescamine. The NGF-specific antibodies or
antigen binding proteins can also be delectably labeled using fluorescence-emitting metals such a       125Eu, or others of
the lanthanide series. These metals can be attached to the NGF specific antibody using such metal chelating groups
as diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) or ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA).
          The NGF-specific antibodies also can be detectably labeled by coupling to a chemiluminescent compound.
The presence of the chemiluminescently labeled antibody is then determined by detecting the presence of
luminescence that arises during the course of a chemical reaction. Examples of useful chemiluminescent labeling
compounds are luminol, isoluminol, theromatic acridinium ester, imidazole, acridinium salt and oxalate ester.
          Likewise, a bioluminescent compound can be used to label the NGF-specific antibody, portion, fragment,
polypeptide, or derivative of the present invention. Bioluminescence is a type of chemiluminescence found in
biological systems in which a catalytic protein increases the efficiency of the chemiluminescent reaction. The
presence of a bioluminescent protein is determined by detecting the presence of luminescence. Important
bioluminescent compounds for purposes of labeling are luciferin, luciferase and aequorin.
          Detection of the NGF-specific antibody, portion, fragment, polypeptide, or derivative can be accomplished
by a scintillation counter, for example, if the detectable label is a radioactive gamma emitter, or by a fluorometer, for
example, if the label is a fluorescent material. In the case of an enzyme label, the detection can be accomplished by
colorometric methods which employ a substrate for the enzyme. Detection can also be accomplished by visual
comparison of the extent of enzymatic reaction of a substrate in comparison with similarly prepared standards.
          For the purposes of the present invention, the NGF which is detected by the above assays can be present in
a biological sample. Any sample containing NGF may be used. For example, the sample is a biological fluid such as,
for example, blood, serum, lymph, urine, feces, inflammatory exudate, cerebrospinal fluid, amniotic fluid, a tissue
extract or homogenate, and the like. The invention is not limited to assays using only these samples, however, it
                                                                  46

being possible for one of ordinary skill in the art, in light of the present specification, to determine suitable
conditions which allow the use of other samples.
          In situ detection can be accomplished by removing a histological specimen from an animal subject, and
providing the combination of labeled antibodies of the present invention to such a specimen. The antibody (or
portion thereof) may be provided by applying or by overlaying the labeled antibody (or portion) to a biological
sample. Through the use of such a procedure, it is possible to determine not only the presence of NGF but also the
distribution of NGF in the examined tissue. Using the present invention, those of ordinary skill will readily perceive
that any of a wide variety of histological methods (such as staining procedures) can be modified in order to achieve
such in situ detection.
          The antibody, fragment or derivative of the present invention can be adapted for utilization in an
immunometric assay, also known as a "two-site" or "sandwich" assay. In a typical immunometric assay, a quantity
of unlabeled antibody (or fragment of antibody) is bound to a solid support that is insoluble in the fluid being tested
and a quantity of detectably labeled soluble antibody is added to permit detection and/or quantification of the ternary
complex formed between solid phase antibody, antigen, and labeled antibody.
          The antibodies may be used to quantitatively or qualitatively detect the NGF in a sample or to detect
presence of cells that express the NGF. This can be accomplished by immunofluorescence techniques employing a
fluorescently labeled antibody (see below) coupled with fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometric, or fluorometric
detection. For diagnostic purposes, the antibodies may either be labeled or unlabeled. Unlabeled antibodies can be
used in combination with other labeled antibodies (second antibodies) that are reactive with the antibody, such as
antibodies specific for canine immunoglobulin constant regions. Alternatively, the antibodies can be directly
labeled. A wide variety of labels may be employed, such as radionuclides, fluors, enzymes, enzyme substrates,
enzyme cofactors, enzyme inhibitors, ligands (particularly haptens), etc. Numerous types of immunoassays, such as
those discussed previously are available and are well known to those skilled in the art. Importantly, the antibodies of
the present invention may be helpful in diagnosing an NGF related disorder in canines. More specifically, the
antibody of the present invention may identify the overexpression of NGF in companion animals. Thus, the antibody
of the present invention may provide an important immunohistochemistry tool. The antibodies of the present
invention may be used on antibody arrays, highly suitable for measuring gene expression profiles.
Kits
          Also included within the scope of the present invention are kits for practicing the subject methods. The kits
at least include one or more of the antibodies of the present invention, a nucleic acid encoding the same, or a cell
containing the same. An antibody of the present invention may be provided, usually in a lyophilized form, in a
container. The antibodies, which may be conjugated to a label or toxin, or unconjugated, are typically included in
the kits with buffers, such as Tris, phosphate, carbonate, etc., stabilizers, biocides, inert proteins, e.g., serum
albumin, or the like. Generally, these materials will be present in less than 5% wt. based on the amount of active
antibody, and usually present in total amount of at least about 0.001% wt. based again on the antibody
concentration. Frequently, it will be desirable to include an inert extender or excipient to dilute the active
ingredients, where the excipient may be present in from about,1% to 99% wt. of the total composition. Where a
                                                          47

second antibody capable of binding to the primary antibody is employed in an assay, this will usually be present in a
separate vial. The second antibody is typically conjugated to a label and formulated in an analogous manner with the
antibody formulations described above. The kit will generally also include a set of instructions for use.
The invention will now be described further by the non-limiting examples below.
EXAMPLES
           The present invention is further illustrated and supported by the following examples. However, these
examples should in no way be considered to further limit the scope of the invention. To the contrary, one having
ordinary skill in the art would readily understand that there are other embodiments, modifications, and equivalents
of the present invention without departing from the spirit of the present invention and/or the scope of the appended
claims.
                                                         Example 1
            Identification of mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing canine nerve growth factor (NGF)
           A series of murine mAbs were produced against mature, human B-NGF (US Patent No. 7,727,527). Once
these mAbs were generated, they were subjected to a variety of analyses, including epitope mapping and in vitro
tests for 1) binding to NGF and 2) ability to block binding of NGF to its receptors TrkA and to a lesser extent p75
and 3) assessment of functional antagonism associated with NGF blockade (blockade of TrkA autophosphorylation,
blockade of NGF-dependent survival of neurons).           Based on these results, it was found that mAbs that bind to
variable regions 1 (B-hairpin turn A' A"), 4 (B-strands C and D) and the carboxy-terminus are capable of blocking
TrkA and p75 binding. Molecular modeling of the binding epitope on NGF of one of these murine mAbs, RN91 1, is
shown in Figure 6A. RN911 was shown to be efficacious in preclinical rodent models of pain associated with
arthritis, cancer, surgical incision as well as neuropathic pain and visceral pain.
Anti-NGF therapy for joint pain in dogs
           Amino acid sequence identity is 100% conserved within the binding epitope of RN911 on B-NGF across
dogs, mice and humans (Fig. 6B, above). High affinity binding of RN911 to recombinant canine NGF (KD           = 755
pM) was experimentally verified and efficacy of the anti-NGF mAb in a canine synovitis pain model that is
routinely used by one skilled in the art in evaluating pain models and described below, was evaluated using RN911.
RN911      was   produced     in sufficient   quantities  using techniques    of one skilled in the art,    for both
pharmacokinetics/toleration and efficacy studies in purpose-bred beagles.         An efficacy study was designed that
involved induction of synovitis at 3 days and 7 days after IV injection of RN911 and evaluation of lameness/pain at
multiple timepoints post-synovitis induction. A pharmacokinetics/toleration study, described in the next section,
was performed prior to the efficacy study to gain confidence in the safety of RN911 in beagles and to collect data
that would help guide dose selection for the efficacy study.
                                                             48

DMPK
Metabolism andDisposition
         As with all proteins, it can be assumed that RN911 is catabolized to amino acids and other endogenous
components. Unchanged RN9 11 is unlikely to be excreted.
Pharmacokinetics
         The pharmacokinetics (PK) of murine anti-NGF mAb RN911 in dogs were studied following single IV
administration . Three dogs were dosed with placebo, 4 dogs at 1.2 mg/kg, 4 dogs at 3.5 mg/kg, and 1 dog at 9.8
mg/kg. Only one dog was utilized at the highest dose. The pharmacokinetic data exhibited low variability and the
similar shape of the profiles of ' free' RN911 at 1ldoses suggested that target-mediated disposition was not a factor
in the PK. The data exhibited excellent dose proportionality. T 1/2 was similar at all doses, averaging 102    27 hours
(n=9). Clearance, at 0.00051     0.00005 L/h/kg, was very slow. Volume of distribution, at 0.072     0.021 L/kg, was
close to what would be expected for a protein which is confined to the blood volume of the dog. Figure 7 shows
data from serum analysis of markers analyzed from the synovitis efficacy study described below. It is clear that the
serum concentrations and pharmacokinetics at 3 mg/kg in the efficacy study were nearly identical to the values at
3.5 mg/kg in the PK study.
         "Bound" RN911 was assayed in both studies using an ELISA method (Figure 8) The concentrations are
reported as NGF-equivalents. The typical RN911-NGF concentrations, which remained near peak levels for at least
one week, were approximately 0.5 ng/mL in NGF-equivalents.           This is roughly 10-fold higher than endogenous
NGF concentrations in canine serum (~40-60 pg/mL).
         The typical RN9 11 -NGF serum concentration, when converted to RN9 11-equivalents, was approximately
5 ng/mL (0.5 ng/mL * molecular weight ratio, 150,000/13,425).            This is far below the measured free RN911
concentrations shown in the first figure and suggest that the mAb may remain in excess (as compared with NGF
concentrations) for several weeks at doses  3 mg/kg.
Immunogenicity
         Anti-drug antibody (ADA) titers were determined before dosing and at the end of the study. As shown in
Table 1, there was evidence of a rise in ADA titers in at least two of the beagles (see dogs 8 and 12). It is not
surprising that RN911 would generate an immune response in beagles given that it is a murine mAb; no attempt was
made to perform repeated dosing studies with this mAb.

BioanalyticalAssay Methodology
         The free RN911 ELISA was based on the use of recombinant canine NGF as the capture agent and
peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG as the detection antibody. QCs as well as standards were included in
the assay run.
         The bound RN91 1-NGF ELISA was based on the use of biotinylated rabbit anti-human NGF adsorbed on a
strepavidin plate. This antibody captured both NGF-RN911 and free NGF, but the NGF-RN911 was selectively
detected using peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG.         Standards were prepared by incubating a known
concentration of canine NGF with a slight molar excess of RN911.
         The anti-drug antibody ELISA utilized RN911 as the capture agent. ADAs in the dog serum samples were
captured on the plate and detected using a mixture of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-dog antibodies which were
able to detect all four canine IgG subclasses.
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD)
         PK/PD data were generated with RN911 in the target species in a synovitis efficacy study. In the synovitis
pain model, transient inflammation of the synovial membrane in a single stifle is induced via intra-articular injection
                                                          50

of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Quantifiable lameness occurs within 2h of synovitis induction, peaks at 3-4h,
is waning by 6h and is fully resolved after 24h. From an IACUC perspective, it is acceptable to induce synovitis on
two separate occasions (i.e., once in each stifle), provided the lameness associated with the first synovitis induction
has fully resolved. Therefore we designed a study in which synovitis was induced in the same beagle 3 days and 7
days after IV treatment (RN911 or PBS vehicle). After each synovitis induction, lameness was quantified using a
visual analogue scale (VAS).
          The results of this study show that RN911 (3 mg/kg, IV) caused a statistically significant decrease in
synovitis-associated lameness at 3 days after dosing (Fig. 4). At this time, the free RN911 serum concentrations
averaged 24400 + 3900 ng/mL (170 + 27 nM; Fig. 2). RN911 was even more effective at 7 days (Fig. 9) when the
free RN911 serum concentration averaged 13200 + 3500 ng/mL (91 + 24 nM; Fig. 7).
                                                         Example 2
                                                   Caninization strategy
          The generation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) can be associated with loss of efficacy for any
biotherapeutic protein including monoclonal antibodies. Comprehensive evaluation of the literature has shown that
speciation of monoclonal antibodies can reduce the propensity for mAbs to be immunogenic although examples of
immunogenic fully human mAbs and non-immunogenic chimeric mAbs can be found.                    To help mitigate risks
associated with ADA formation for the mouse anti-NGF, RN9 11, monoclonal antibody provided herein, a
caninization strategy was employed. This caninization strategy is based on identifying the most appropriate canine
germline antibody sequence for CDR grafting (Figure 3).          Following extensive analysis of all available canine
germline sequences for both the heavy and light chains, germline candidates were selected on their homology to
RN9 11, and the CDRs from RN911 were used to replace native canine CDRs. The objective was to retain high
affinity and cell-based activity using fully canine frameworks to minimize the potential of immunogenicity in vivo.
Caninized mAbs were optimized for mammalian expression, expressed and characterized for their ability to bind
NGF via SPR. These results are described below in Example 3. Only mAbs that retained both reliable expression
levels and the ability to bind NGF following caninization were advanced for further characterization. Those mAbs
that did not express transiently or lost the ability to bind NGF were systematically dissected to identify: 1) the chain
responsible for loss of function of lack of expression, 2) the framework responsible for the loss of expression or
function and 3) the amino acid(s) responsible for loss of expression or function.
                                                         Example 3
                                            Caninization of RN911 antibody
          Synthetic constructs representing the caninized variable heavy and light chains of mAb RN911 were made.
Following subcloning of each variable chain into plasmids containing the respective canine heavy or kappa constant
region, plasmids were co-transfected for antibody expression in HEK 293 cells. The canine heavy chain constant
region of the present invention are not limited to any particular subtype, however in some embodiments the canine
                                                             51

heavy chain is described as SEQ ID. NO. 45 or SEQ ID NO. 48. The canine kappa light chain constant regions are
not limited to any particular sequences, however in some embodiments of the present invention the canine kappa
constant region is described as SEQ ID. NO. 47. Frameworks used for mAb "canE3M65" expressed in HEK 293
transient expression system and retained NGF binding upon caninization. (Seq ID NO.33 "CAN-E3M-VL", SEQ
ID NO. 34. "CAN-N2G9-VH").
          In contrast, the germline sequences used for the can618 (CAN-618-VL; CAN-N2G9-VH)             caninization
efforts resulted in certain non-expressing mAbs. Chimeric, heterochimeric, and caninized versions of mAb RN911
were expressed and characterized for their ability to bind canine NGF via SPR. These results demonstrated that the
caninized antibody did not express. Also, with respect to the heterochimeras, the chimeric heavy chain paired with
the caninized light chain lost expression, while the caninized heavy chain paired with the chimeric light chain
retained expression in HEK293 cells. Based on the results obtained from the heterochimeras, it was deduced that
the caninized light chain was responsible for the loss of expression. In an effort to restore expression of the
caninized versions of RN911 in which expression was lost, the caninized light chain was modified by swapping
framework sequences. Figure 10 provides an overview of the can9 11 light chain framework substitution work. This
work identified an antibody replacing residues within the canine framework II (FWII) with mouse framework II
sequence and restoring expression in HEK293 cells (SEQ ID NO.35 "CAN-618-VL",                SEQ ID NO. 36 "CAN
QC23-VL", and variable heavy chain SEQ ID NO.34 "CAN-N2G9-VH").
          Figure 11 summarizes the results of both the expression and respective mutations. These data demonstrate
that the caninized derivatives using frameworks 3 and 4 both retain HEK expression levels comparable to their
precursor molecule and show binding to canine NGF. Framework 1 retained expression to a lesser extent, but also
maintained binding to canine NGF.
                                                      Example 4
                       Characterization of canine NGF binding to caninized anti-NGF mAbs
          Affinities of each caninized anti-NGF antibody to canine NGF were measured using SPR (Surface Plasmon
Resonance). In addition, a functional in vitro assay was developed to measure inhibition constants for the mAbs
ability to inhibit binding of NGF to TrkA. Data shown in Figure 12 and 13 for can6512 (CAN-N2G9-VH, CAN
E3M-VL, CAN-65E-HC, CAN-KAPPA-LC) and RN911                   illustrate high affinity binding of mAbs to NGF and
potent inhibition by mAbs of NGF binding to receptor trkA. Some affinity was lost, however, upon caninization to
mAb CAN-N2G9-VH, CAN-E3M.               Due to this loss of affinity, the caninized mAb was affinity matured (see
Example 5 for details) to regain potency.     Included in Figures 12 and 13 are the results of the affinity matured
products, SSM57 (SEQ ID NO. 27 "CAN-SSM57-VH", SEQ ID NO. 26 "CAN-SSME3M-VL"), SSM58 (SEQ ID
NO. 28 CAN-SSM58-VH,          SEQ ID NO. 26 "CAN-SSME3M-VL"), and SSM66 (SEQ ID NO.29 CAN-SSM66,
SEQ ID NO. 26 CAN-SSME3M-VL) on each SPR assay.

                                   Affinity maturation of caninized anti-NGF mAb
          Affinity maturation of canE3M65 (SEQ ID NO. 16 "CAN-E3M-VL", SEQ ID NO. 17 "CAN-N2G9-VH")
was necessary to return the affinity of the caninized mAb to that of the progenitor mouse antibody. Two antibody
libraries were designed to contain individual point mutations within the antibody sequence in CDR regions only.
Figure 15 outlines the design strategy of each Fab library in which the Look-Through Mutagenesis (LTM) library
comprises individual site mutations limited to one of nine representative amino acid residues, while the Site
Saturation Mutagenesis (SSM) library can sample any natural amino acid (Cys and Met were excluded here). The
LTM library was constructed to identify beneficial mutations in CDRH3, CDRL1, and CDRL3. Alternatively, the
SSM library mutations are located in CDRH1, CDRH2, and CDRL2, allowing us to combine beneficial mutations
from each library.
          The LTM library was constructed from a series of primers designed using an oligonucleotide design
program commonly used by those of skill in the art.          PCR products were combined to achieve a Fab library
comprised of single mutations on each of the three specified CDRs, as well as combinations including variations on
CDRH3, CDRL1, and/or CDRL3.            A 93% ligation efficiency was achieved with a library size of ~10^14.  Four
rounds of panning with decreasing amounts of biotinylated canine NGF were run and extended off-rates were
selected for by extended overnight wash steps. Amount of NGF antigen used ranged from     Ing/pL beads to 1Opg/pL
beads and Fabs were eluted using non-biotinylated NGF in excess. After the fourth round of panning, outputs were
cloned into a TOPO vector and sequenced. Enriched mutations are shown in Table 2.

         Various KD' s correspond to diffeent sensors, surface density varies slightly. Agg indicates that a binding
curve showing signs of antibody aggregation was seen in at least one run.
         Four rounds of phage display using the SSM library were performed using single site mutations on the
same wild-type sequence used for LTM. Libraries were panned against biotinylated or free canine NGF and
selected for high affinity and slow off-rate after each round. Selections were run as shown below, round 4 outputs
were TOPO cloned and sequenced.

 (2) bioNGF antigen on streptavidin beads.
 (3) Immunotube with dNGF immobilized on tube
 (4) E33 positive control on streptavidin beads with bioNGF
 (5) E33 positive control with immunotube / dNGF antigen
                           * note positive controls will verify appropriate stringency
                                                              58

Note: Using chemical elution only (100mM TEA) to assure that we don't screen out the tightest binders.
Negative selection for immunotube = tube w/o dNGF immobilized.
Negative selection for strep beads = beads w/o bioNGF immobilized.
extended washes select for very slow off-rates; stringency increased with rounds.

           Table 6 above shows the sequenced outputs from SSM-library display as well as initial diversity. Enriched
sites were selected for both single-site and multi-site (combinations of enriched sites) mutations and subsequent IgG
conversion. SSM mutations for both heavy and light chains were generated on three templates: (1) wild-type mAb,
(2) LTM109 (3) LTM135.
           Mutated antibodies were expressed in HEK293 cells and evaluated for binding affinities to canine NGF
(results below; expression results in Tables 7-9). Antibodies SSM57 (SEQ ID NO. 27 "CAN-SSM57-VL, SEQ ID
NO 26 "CAN-SSM-E3M-VL"), SSM58 (SEQ ID NO. 28 "CAN-SSM58-VH", SEQ ID NO. 26 ""CAN-SSM-E3M

                   Production of caninized antibodies form Glutamine synthetase (GS) plasmids
          The genes encoding the caninized RN911 mAbs were cloned into GS plasmids pEE 6.4 and pEE 12.4,
respectively (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland).   The resulting plasmids were digested according to the manufacturer' s
protocol and ligated together to form a single mammalian expression plasmid. Each plasmid was used to transfect
HEK 293 cells and expression was carried out in 20L of culture media. Protein was isolated form conditioned HEK
medium using Protein A affinity chromatography according to standard protein purification methods. Medium was
loaded onto chromatographic resin and eluted by pH shift. Eluted protein was pH adjusted, dialyzed, and sterile
filtered prior to use. The resulting antibody was greater than 99 percent monomeric by analytical size exclusion

                             Evaluation of caninized antibody in the dog synovitis model
          Caninized mAb (CAN-SSME3M-VL, CAN-SSM57-HC) was tested in dog synovitis model at 5mg/kg IV
and 5mg/kg SC. Results of study are shown in Figure 14, inducing synovitis at 7 days and 28 days post-dose.
Caninized mAb showed efficacy for both SC and IV dosing regimens both 7 and 28 days post-dose.

                                         Pharmacokinetics of caninized antibody
          The pharmacokinetics (PK) of the caninized SSM57 mAb (PF-06442591) was studied in six dogs at 5
mg/kg using subcutaneous (SC) administration. Dogs were dosed with mAb at 5 mg/kg SC once every 14 days
(Day 0, Day 14, Day 28) for a total of three injections and were euthanized on Day 35 for a full safety assessment
(see Safety information below). Serum samples from each dog were collected prior to each dose and periodically
over 35 days. Antibody concentration was measured in an ELISA based format in which canine NGF was used to
capture mAb from the serum. The antibody was then detected using a labeled anti-dog antibody recognizing the Fc
portion of the antibody subclass. Results are shown in Figure 16.

                                   Evaluation of caninized antibody in rat MIA model
          Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by joint pain and a progressive loss of
articular cartilage. Intra-articular injection of MIA induces loss of articular cartilage with progression of subchondral
bone lesions that mimic those of OA. This model offers a rapid and minimally invasive method to reproduce OA
like lesions in a rodent species.
          The analgesic effect of caninized anti-NGF antibodies at one dose of MIA in the rat MIA model of
osteoarthritis was demonstrated by dosing caninized SSM57 mAb (PF-06442591) twice during the study on study
day 7 and study day 14. Pain was assessed using weight bearing test for sustained pain and joint compression
(Randall Selitto) test for mechanical hyperalgesia. See Figure 17 for a schematic of the rat MIA procedure.

                                                           70

                                   with a maximum of 3 rats per polypropylene cage. The cages were
                                   fitted with solid bottoms and filled with sterile wood shavings as
                                   bedding material.
      Food and Water:              Animals are provided ad libitum with a commercial, sterile rodent diet
                                   and had free access to drinking water that is supplied to each
                                   cage via polyethylene bottles with stainless steel sipper tubes.
      Environment:                 Automatically controlled environmental conditions were set to
                                   maintain temperature at 17-23 0 C with a relative humidity (RH) of
                                   30-70%, a 12:12 hour light: dark cycle and 15-30 air changes/h
                                   in the study room. Temperature and RH were monitored daily.
      Randomization:               During the acclimation period, animals were randomly assigned
                                   to experimental groups. Each dosing group was kept in separate
                                   cages to avoid cross-contamination which can occur through
                                   consumption of fecal matter.
      Termination:                 At the end of the study, surviving animals were euthanized by
                                   pentobarbital sodium.
          Study was performed following approval of an application form submitted to the Committee for Ethical
Conduct in the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals that stated that the study complied with the rules and
regulations set forth.
Weight Bearing Test:
Rat Training - Habituation to Testing Environment:
          This training regime was required as it was anticipated that the level of variability within the experiment is
relatively high. Therefore, use of this protocol would help to reduce variability and increase the likelihood of a
successful study. Each rat was handled for 1 min then placed in the test apparatus (incapacitance meter) for 5
minutes (habituation to test apparatus). This procedure was performed on study day -2.
Weight Bearing Assessment Details:
          Weight bearing deficits were measured in all rats on study day -1, this measurement served as a baseline.
Weight bearing was then recorded on study days 9, 16, 21 and 28. Incapacitance meter records 3 measurements over
a period of 5 seconds and then averages these to obtain 1 value.
                                                           71

 Mechanical Hyperalgesia (Randall-Selitto test):
 Mechanical thresholds, expressed in grams, was measured in rats with the Randall-Selitto test using an
 analgesimeter (Ugo Basile). The test was performed by applying a noxious pressure to the hind paw. By pressing a
 pedal that activated a motor, the force increased at a constant rate on the linear scale. When the animal displayed
 pain by withdrawal of the paw or vocalization, the pedal was immediately released and the nociceptive threshold
 read on a scale. The cut-off of 400 g was used to avoid potential tissue injury. Randall-Selitto test was performed on
 study days -1 (baseline) and 28.
 Clinical Signs:
 Throughout the 30-day study, careful clinical examinations were performed at least once daily. If any abnormalities
 were observed they were recorded. Observations include changes in skin, fur, eyes, mucous membranes, occurrence
 of secretions and excretions (e.g., diarrhea), autonomic activity (e.g., lacrimation, salivation, piloerection, pupil size,
 unusual respiratory pattern), gait, posture, and response to handling, as well as the presence of unusual behavior,
 tremors, convulsions, sleep, and coma.
 RESULTS:
 Mean group body weight for all groups (g).

 Response to Weight bearing test (difference between legs) (g):
*p<0.05 vs. Vehicle using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test.
 The weight bearing of each leg was measured separately by weight bearing apparatus (IITC, Series 8, Model 600*).
 This test quantifies the spontaneous postural changes reflecting spontaneous pain by independently measuring, on
 two separate sensors, the weight that the animal applies on each hind paw.
                                                           72

Results were calculated and represented as the percentage of weight that the animal leaned on the injected right leg
or intact left leg from the total amount of leaned weight on the two hind legs. Then the difference between the two
values of intact left leg minus injected right leg is calculated.
Weight bearing test measures the animal ability to carry its weight on the hind legs. In normal condition the animal
carries its weight equally on both hind legs (50% on the right leg and 50% on the left leg). Therefore, the difference
between the percentage of weight carried on each leg will be close to 0%. As the animal experiences pain, this
situation changes. The animal will tend to carry more weight on the nonpainful leg and less weight on the painful
leg. As a result, the difference between the percentage of weight carried on both legs increases.
