                                    ABSTRACT:
  A method of building construction, particularly suitable for reactive soils,
  where the reinforcing steel of the edge beams of a building slab is fixed to
5 load transfer plates on the tops of piles supporting the slab. The load transfer
  plates are selectively vertically adjustable relative to the upper ends of the
  piles ; but can be locked relative thereto to oppose both lateral and vertical
  movement of the soils.

                                   BUILDING SLAB SYSTEM
                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:
 1. Field of the Invention:
 [0001] This invention relates to a building slab system.
 [0002] The invention particularly relates, but is not limited to, a method of constructing a
 building slab, and a building slab, suitable for use with reactive soils.
 2. Prior art:
 [0003] Many geographical areas in Australia, including Adelaide, have reactive soils,
 typically containing a high clay content. It is not unknown for such reactive soils to be
 liable to vertical "heave" exceeding 30cm between fully dry and fully wet.
 [0004] The 'heave" of the reactive soils has resulted in damage to building foundations,
 and to vertical displacement of a building relative to adjacent facilities / utilities.
 [0005] One solution used to try to overcome the effects of the "heave" has been the use
of building slabs, supported on piers or piles anchored in underlying stable soil zones
e.g. bedrock.
[0006] It has been known, however, that the "heave" of the reactive soils e.g. following
rain after a long period of drought, has been so large as to raise the slabs from the
supporting piers or piles. Furthermore, as the soils have dried, the slabs have re
engaged the piers or piles, but horizontally offset from their original positions.
[0007] International Publication WO 2010/096883 Al (= PCT/AU2010/000233 = AU
2010217205) (Trista Technology Pty Ltd) discloses a "Building Construction Method
and System" where the perimeter beams of the building slab have sloped lower
surface(s) to divert the swelling (i.e. reactive) soils away from the perimeter beams e.g.
into voids. The slab is supported by a plurality of screw piles. The perimeter beams are
tied to supports or cradles, positioned on the screw piles. Each screw pile is fitted with a
pile cap such that a structural slip joint is formed between the pile cap and the slab.
[0008] This means that the slab can still move vertically as the soils swells. While the
vertical movement of the slab is relatively controlled, such movement can lead to the
failure of utilities (e.g. water pipes, sewage pipes, storm-water pipes, electricity cables

                                               2
  and telephone wires 0 fibre cables) connected to the slab or the building supported
 thereon.
                        OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION:
  [0009] It is an object of the present invention to prove a building slab construction
 where the slab, supported on piers or piles (hereinafter "piles") is secured against
 vertical movement due to "heave" of underlying reactive soils.
 [0010] It is a preferred object to prove a method for securing the building slab to the
 supporting piles.
 [0011] Other preferred objects will become apparent from the following description.
                       SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION;
 [0012] In one embodiment, the present invention resides in a method of building
 construction, where a building slab is supported by a plurality of piles, wherein:
 reinforcing steel for at least one edge beam of the slab is fixed to respective load
transfer plates on the piles.
 [0013] Preferably, each load transfer plate is selectively vertically adjustable relative to
an upper end of its respective pile, but is selectively lockable relative to the pile to
oppose both lateral and vertical movement of the soil(s).
[0014] In a second embodiment, the present invention resides in a building construction
having a building slab supported on a plurality of piles, wherein:
reinforcing steel for at least one edge beam of the slab is fixed to respective load
transfer plates on the piles.
[0015] Preferably, each load transfer plate is selectively vertically adjustable relative to
an upper end of its respective pile, but is selectively lockable relative to the pile to
oppose both lateral and vertical movement of the soil(s).
[0016] Preferably, each pile is a screw pile or blade pile, having:
 a tubular shaft;
at least one helical screw or blade at or adjacent a lower end of the shaft; and
a drive cap or nut, with a screw-threaded bore therethrough, at or adjacent an upper
end of the shaft.
[0017] Preferably, each load transfer plate has:

                                               3
 a plate body to which the reinforcing steel is fixable e.g. by welding, clamping or tying;
 and
 a screw-threaded bolt or shank engageable in the screw-threaded bore;
 at least one (optional) lock-nut selectively releasing or locking the bolt or shank relative
 to cap or structural nut, and thereby to the pile.
 [0018] Other features of the present invention will become apparent from the following
 description.

          DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS:
[0021] The building slabs, to be hereinafter described, may be supported on screw piles
or blade piles, or suitably modified piers, hereinafter referred to as "piles". The piles may

                                                4
  be in accordance with the piles disclosed in detail in AU 2013100623 (Patented
  Foundations Pty Ltd), the contents of which are incorporated by reference.
 [0022] The crushable void formers, to be hereinafter described, may be formed of
 crushable material, e.g. cardboard, foamed plastics or the like, and/or incorporated
 crush zones and/or fold lines.
 [0023] Before constructing the building slab over the reactive soil(s), it will be typical
 practice to:
 a) scarify / plough the top surface of the reactive soil(s); and
 b) wet the reactive soil(s);
 so that the lower portion of the building slab will be above the top surface of the reactive
 soil(s) after the top surface of the reactive soil(s) has undergone vertical movement or
 "heave".
 [0024] Referring to the first embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 5, the building slab 10
 is supported on a plurality of piles 70, with blade piles being preferred. The piles 70 are
 arranged in a pattern to support the edge beams 30 of the slab 10, together with other
 portions of the slab 10 supporting e.g. load bearing walls (see FIG. 2) or external walls
adjacent a slab step down (see FIG. 3)
[0025] The slab 10, formed of steel-reinforced concrete, has two layers of slab mesh 21
in the floor portions 20, connected to reinforcing steel cages 31 in the edge beams 30.
Load-bearing walls LW are supported by the floor portions 20, while (cavity) external
walls EW are supported by the edge beams 30 and slab step downs 30A.
[0026] The configuration of the underside of the slab 10 is, in part, defined by the
positioning on the crushable void formers VF, which are overlaid with a water proofing
membrane M before the concrete C is poured.
[0027] As will be hereinafter described in more detail, the reinforcing steel cages 31 in
the edge beams 30 are welded to the load transfer plates 80 mounted on respective
piles 70; while the floor portions 20 are supported by load transfer plates 90, also
supported by the piles 70. (NB: The slab mesh 21 in the floor portions 20 may also be
welded, or otherwise fixed, to the load transfer plates 90.)
[0028] As shown in more detail in FIGS. 4 and 5, the steel cages 31 are of substantially
Z-shape and have parallel lower rods 32, 33, interconnected by lower cross-bars 34;
parallel upper rods 35, 36, interconnected by upper cross-bars 37; and vertical rods 38

                                              5
  interconnecting rods 33, 35.
  [0029] The external formwork, not shown, and the void formers VF, defines the
 configuration of the edge beam 20 with vertical inner and outer faces 39, 40,
 interconnected by an inclined bottom face 41 (e.g. at 200 to the horizontal).
 [0030] As shown in FIGS. 4, 5 and 7, the lower rods 32, 33 are received within inwardly
 directed sockets 83, 83 in the body 81 of the load transfer plate 80. This arrangement
 assists in preventing the steel cages 31 being released from the load transfer plate 80
 under extreme vertical lifting loads, or "heave", applied to the underside of the slab 20
 by the reactive soil RS. These loads can occur when the void formers VF do not crush
 as designed, or all available crushing has occurred.
 [0031] Referring to FIGS. 7 and 8, the load transfer plate 80 has an elongate slot 84 in
 the body 81, the slot 84 receiving the screw-threaded shank 86 of a bolt 85. A lock-nut
 87, on the shank 86, enables the bolt 85 to be adjustably clamped in a range of
 positions relative to the body 81, to enable the sockets 82, 83 to be aligned with the
 lower rods 32, 33 of the steel cage 31.
 [0032] As illustrated in FIG. 9, the shanks 86, 96 of the load transfer plates 80, 90 are
 screw-threadably received in threaded bores 74 through drive caps, or structural nuts
 73, at the upper ends 72 of the shafts 71 of the piles 70. Lock-nuts 87, 97 may be
 provided to lock the shanks 86, 96 against rotation when the load transfer plates 80, 90
have been adjusted to their respective desired heights. The drive caps may be in
accordance with the disclosure in AU 2012101551 (Patented Foundations Pty Ltd).
[0033] The piles 70 are driven into the soils until the blades 75, adjacent the digging
point 76 at the lower end 77 of the shaft 71, is engaged in a stable soil strata SS below
the reactive soil strata(s) RS. The piles 70 are driven into the stable soil strata SS until
the driving torque indicates the piles 70 can both support, and resist, vertical loads of
e.g. 80 KN SWL.
[0034] When the reactive soils strata undergoes swelling, or "heave" the crushable void
formers VF are crushed to take up the vertical movement of the top surface of the
reactive soil strata(s) RS relative to the underside of the slab 20; while any upward
movement of the slab 20 is rested by the connection of the steel cages 31 to the piles
70 via the load transfer plates 80, 90.
[0035] FIG. 9 illustrates a second embodiment, using an alternative steel cage 131

                                              6
 within the edge beam 130, where the lower rod 32 is omitted; the lower rod 133 lies
 adjacent a vertical flange 183 on the body 181 of the load transfer plate; and the lower
 cross-bar 134 and/or lower rod 133 are welded to the plate body 181.
 [0036] In addition, a secondary steel cage 131A has an upper rod 135A received in a
 socket 182A on the underside of the plate body 181, and is connected to a lower rod
 132A by vertical rods 138A. The upper rod 135A is preferably welded to the socket
 182A.
[0037] As for the first embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 8, the connection of the steel
cages 131, 131A to the piles 170, via the load transfer plates 180, resists any lifting
forces on the slab 110.
[0038] The skilled addressee will appreciate that the configuration of the steel cages 31,
131, 131A; and/or the number / spacing / load capacity of the piles 70, 170, can be
varied to suit the particular building 10, 110 to be erected and/or the characteristics of
the reactive soil strata(s) RS and/or stable soil strata(s) SS.
[0039] Advantages of the present invention include, but are not limited to:
     1. The piles are set attached to the building foundations by rigid (non- slip)
        joints;
    2. The pile installation tolerance is not critical;
    3. The piles are locked into the perimeter beams by use of the steel load
        transfer plates. This locks the piles into the edge beams, so as to resist uplift
        pressures of the clay / reactive soil(s) on the underside surface(s) of the edge
        beams;
    4. The adjustable load transfer plate positions the steel reinforcing (Z-) cage, in
        to its correct position, and ensuring correct concrete cover;
    5. The adjustable load transfer plate can be provided for all internal pile
        locations;
    6. The adjustable load transfer plates are installed after positioning of water
        proofing plastic membrane over the void formers. This will enable the
        engineer to check for correctness as to location of the piles;
    7. Enables a "Two Brick Rebate" same as a "Waffle Pod Edge Beam";
    8. Uses the same formwork as a "Waffle Pod Slab";
    9. Maintains a BCA visual "Termite Barrier";

                                               7
     10. With a solid 80mm upper section of the void farmers, one can obtain a R
          Rating for insulation of the slab;
     11. The fixed joint connections between the steel gages and the piles also
         ensures a larger lateral capacity for the foundations for the slab, in situations
         where there are "Slope Stability" issues i.e. where there are lateral loads
         transferred to the piles as a result of ground creep;.
    12. There is an improved structural capacity of the slab, as joints are analysed as
         fixed, and not pins;
    13. Line loads are easily designed in to the new system;
    14. Due to the adjustable load transfer plates, the piles are sealed units, thus
         negating internal corrosion calculations, and extending the expected life of the
         piles to 120+ years.
 [0040] The skilled addressee will appreciate the actual design / specification of the slab
 and piles will be varied to suit the particular intended building construction and the
 respective regulatory requirements / Standards.
 [0041] Various changes and modifications may be made to the embodiments described
 and illustrated without departing from the present invention.
