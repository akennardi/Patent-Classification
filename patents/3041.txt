                    CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
    [00011          The application claims the benefit of U.S.           provisional     patent
 5  application 61/784,925 filed on March 14, 2013, titled "Oxygen Sensors", which
    application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
                                     TECHNICAL FIELD
    [00021          The present disclosure is in the field of luminescent dyes, polymers
   and biosensors.
10                                     BACKGROUND
    [00031          Diagnosis, treatment and management of some medical conditions
   require monitoring of oxygen concentration in the afflicted organ or tissue. For
   example, Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD), a disease that is characterized by plaque
   buildup in arteries that carry blood to the extremities, head, or organs, if left untreated,
15 can lead to complete blockage of lower extremity arteries and requires either open
   bypass surgery or endovascular intervention. Annually, at least 140,000 such
   revascularization procedures are conducted in the US alone to restore blood flow to
   ischemic tissues. Thus, ensuring that blood and oxygen flow are adequately restored
   and maintained during and after the revascularization technique is highly desirable.
20 Current monitoring methods are expensive, cumbersome, time consuming, and do not
   provide accurate, continuous tissue oxygenation information. Thus, there is clearly a
   need for a better long-term oxygen tissue monitoring system. Doing so non-invasively
   with minimal user maintenance is essential, and sensor longevity of days to months is
   crucial in actual user environments.
25 [00041           Such real-time, continuous measurement of oxygen concentration
   (partial pressure) in tissues can be achieved by the use of sensors inserted or
   implanted into the tissue and measuring the signal generated by the sensor by a device
   located outside the body. Luminescence provides a useful tool for the design of such
   sensors. Luminescent oxygen sensors are based on the phenomenon that oxygen has a
30 quenching effect on the molecular luminescence of various chemical compounds and
   that this effect can be employed for measuring oxygen concentrations (partial
   pressure) in vivo. The sensors, which are monitored optically through the skin, require
                                                1

   WO 2014/160258                                                           PCT/US2014/026183
   a highly stable dye with excitation and emission spectra in the near-infrared (NIR)
   optical window of the skin. These dye properties are crucial for the successful design
   of a luminescent oxygen sensor that can be implanted deep into tissue. Monitoring
   non-invasively through the skin requires the use of dyes with excitation and emission
 5 wavelengths in the optical window of the skin (approximately 550 to 1000 nm) to
   minimize light scattering and absorbance, and achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio.
   However, commercially available NIR dyes can be prone to photobleaching.
   Palladium porphyrins, such as tetracarboxyphenyl porphyrin (Pd-TCPP) have a very
   large Stokes shift and emission in the NIR.         However, they unfortunately require
10 excitation with green light (525 nm), which is largely absorbed by the skin and the
   underlying tissue. Additionally, currently available sensors, made of rigid materials
   that vastly differ from the mechanical properties of tissue in which they are implanted,
   are bulky and inconvenient, and induce a series of biological events upon
   implantation that ultimately culminate in the formation of a fibrous capsule that walls
15 it off from the body.
   [0005]           Thus, until the present invention there remains a clear need in the art to
   provide improved stable, near-IR luminescent compounds and sensors for direct, rapid
   and accurate measurement of oxygen levels in tissue, particularly in vivo.

10  [0011]         Figure 1 depicts Compound 2 (Pd-BP) absorption and emission
   spectra. Spectra were taken of covalently bound Pd-BP in pHEMA hydrogel.
   Excitation at 633 nm gave 805 nm emission, confirming shift into the NIR.
    [00121         Figure 2 demonstrates that Compound 2 (Pd-BP) incorporated into a
   pHEMA hydrogel sensor enables brighter signals from deeper within the tissue.
15 Images above show intensity of NIR Pd-BP (A) and green-ex Pd-TCPP (B)
   subcutaneous hydrogel implants measured in a rat carcass. Pd-BP is significantly
   brighter than TCPP due to the NIR excitation and emission wavelengths, which allow
   much greater light penetration into the skin, enabling deeper sensor placement.
   [00131          Figure 3 depicts luminescence signal of pHEMA 02 sensor implanted
20 in a mouse brain.
   [00141          Figure 4 depicts luminescence of oxygen sensors implanted in rat skin
   (170 days). Intensity varies as a function of implantation depth (data normalized to
   baseline fluorescence) and tissue oxygen concentration.           Inhaled oxygen was
   modulated between 100% and 12% and images were collected every 30 s in a Caliper
25 IVIS (Ex   = 640 nm, Em=800 nm). Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around the
   sensors and the data plotted versus time. Data is shown in Figure 6.

   scaffold.

   lifetime signal remains constant.

 5 tissue-integrated sensors (A) is rapid (~30 seconds), while the response of the solid
   sensor (B) response is much slower (plateau not even reached after 5 minutes). The
   solid sensors are the same rod-shape and material composition.

   hydrogels to 02 (A) and a Stern-Vomer plot of 02 quenching efficiency with Pd-BP
10 (B). The response is linear with good sensitivity and rapid response time.

                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0022]          Described herein are polymerizable luminescent dyes useful for
25 incorporation into polymers and polymers comprising as monomeric units residues of
   the dyes of the present invention. The dyes and the polymers are useful, for example,
   in sensing and imaging applications, for example, accurate and optionally long term
   measurements of oxygen in vivo and in vitro.

   WO 2014/160258                                                          PCT/US2014/026183
    [00231         Additionally, described herein are sensors comprising the polymers of
   the present invention. The sensors can be implanted into a tissue of a subject and used
   for long-term or short-term continuous and semi-continuous collection of data of
   various biochemical analytes, optionally without the use of implantable hardware of
 5 any type and/or enzymatic and electrochemical detection methods. In one aspect, the
   sensors are tissue integrating, e.g., allow capillaries to grow in close proximity to all
   regions of the sensor (e.g., on the surface and inside), which results in accurate
   analyte measurements, including over long term. In another aspect, in addition to the
   luminescent dyes and/or the polymers of the present invention, the sensors comprise
10 an oxidase, such as, but not limited to, glucose oxidase, and the luminescent dyes
   and/or their residues incorporated as monomeric units into the polymers measure the
   consumption of oxygen by the oxidase, thus, the sensors can provide detection of a
   number of analytes other than oxygen, such as, but not limited to, glucose.
    [00241         Advantages of the dyes and luminescent polymers provided herein
15 include, but are not limited to: (1) excitation and emission wavelengths in the optical
   window of the skin (approximately 550 nm to 1000 nm) allowing detection of
   analytes deep within a tissue or an organ; (2) high signal-to-noise ratio; (3) large
   Stokes shifts and emission; (4) photostablity, e.g., the dyes and/or polymers do not
   undergo rapid photobleaching.
20  [0025]         Advantages of the sensors described herein include, but are not limited
   to: (1) providing devices that generate stable signal over a long period of time (e.g.,
   greater than a week, greater than a month, greater than 6 months), (2) providing
   devices that are placed or implanted and integrate into the subject's tissue (e.g.,
   through tissue and/or capillary in-growth); (3) providing devices which can be
25 implanted through syringe injection or trocar injection, meaning that no surgery is
   required to put the sensing media in place in the body; (4) providing devices that do
   not include sensor electronics in the body; (5) providing devices that accurately assess
   analyte (e.g., oxygen) concentration for long periods of time (e.g., greater than a
   week, typically weeks, months or years) and/or (6) providing devices of small
30 dimensions which will give result in increased patent comfort and better acceptance
   by the body.

   [00261           It must be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended
   claims, the singular forms "a", "an", and "the" include plural referents unless the
   content clearly dictates otherwise.         Thus, for example, reference to a sensor
   comprising "a sensing moiety" includes devices comprising of two or more sensing
 5 moieties. Likewise, reference to "an analyte" refers to two or more analytes.
            Definitions
   [0027]           The term "tissue integrating" refers to a material (e.g., scaffold) which,
   when integrated into living tissue remains in close proximity with the blood vessels of
10 the tissue (e.g., capillaries).
   [00281           By "long-term" is meant that the implant senses the analyte for greater
   than about 7 days, for example weeks, months, or years.
   [0029]           By "biodegradable" or "bioabsorbable" is meant that the material is
   capable of being broken down by the subject's body over a period of time, ranging
15 from days to weeks to months or years.
   [00301           By "hydrogel" is meant a material that absorbs a solvent (e.g. water),
   undergoes rapid swelling without discernible dissolution, and maintains three
   dimensional networks capable of reversible deformation.
   [0031]           The term "stimuli-responsive" refers to substrances, e.g., polymers,
20 that change their physical state, e.g., undergo a phase transition, when exposed to an
   external stimulus or according to the environment they are in. Non-limiting examples
   of such polymers are "smart polymers" (Kumar A. et al., Smart polymers: Physical
   forms and bioengineering applications. Prog.Polym. Sci. 32 (2007) 1205-1237).

   encapsulated into a solid, oxygen-impermeable nanosphere. The nanospheres can be
   used for luminescent, non-oxygen sensitive applications.
15        B. Polymers
   [0043]          The fluorescent dyes of the present invention comprise polymerizable
   groups, e.g., residue of acrylic or methacrylic acid, and can be co-polymerized with
   other monomers to provide polymers comprising near-IR luminescent groups. When
   the compounds have 2 or more polymerizable groups, the polymers obtained from
20 their co-polymerization with other monomers can be crosslinked. Alternatively,
   another crosslinking monomer can be added into the polymerization mixture to
   achieve a higher degree of crosslinking of the resulting polymer.

    [0044]          Polymers described herein can be prepared in any suitable manner.
   Suitable synthetic methods used to produce the polymers provided herein include, by
   way of non-limiting example, cationic, anionic and free radical polymerization. In
   certain embodiments, polymer synthesis is performed neat or in any suitable solvent.
 5 Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, pentane, hexane, dichloromethane,
   chloroform, water, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, DMSO or dimethyl formamide
   (DMF). In certain embodiments, the polymer synthesis is performed at any suitable
   reaction temperature, including, e.g., from about -50'C to about 100 0C, or from about
   00 C to about 70 0 C.
10 [0045]                  Preferably the polymers are prepared by the means of a free
   radical polymerization. When a free radical polymerization process is used, (i) the
   monomer, (ii) optionally, the co-monomer(s), and (iii) an optional source of free
   radicals are provided to trigger a free radical polymerization process. In some
   embodiments, the source of free radicals is optional because some monomers may
15 self-initiate upon heating at high temperature. In certain instances, after forming the
   polymerization mixture, the mixture is subjected to polymerization conditions. Such
   conditions are optionally varied to any suitable level and include, by way of non
   limiting example, temperature, pressure, light, atmosphere, ratios of starting
   components      used   in  the   polymerization  mixture     and  reaction   time.  The
20 polymerization is carried out in any suitable manner, including, e.g., in solution,
   dispersion, suspension, emulsion or bulk.
   [0046]                  In some embodiments, initiators are present in the reaction
   mixture. Any suitable initiator is optionally utilized if useful in the polymerization
   processes described herein. Such initiators include, by way of non-limiting example,
25 one or more of alkyl peroxides, substituted alkyl peroxides, aryl peroxides, substituted
   aryl    peroxides,    acyl   peroxides,   alkyl  hydroperoxides,     substituted   alkyl

   compounds. In specific embodiments, benzoylperoxide (BPO) and/or AIBN are used
   as initiators.
   [0047]                   In some embodiments, polymerization processes are carried out
   in a controlled (living) mode. Preferred controlled (living) polymerization processes
 5 include reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization
   processes and Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP).
   [0048]           In certain embodiments, the polymer of the present invention is a
   hydrogel.      For example, the hydrogel can be prepared by reacting hydroxyethyl
   methacrylate      (HEMA),     to  form   poly(hydroxyethyl   methacrylate),  pHEMA.
10 Furthermore, various comonomers can be used in combination to alter the
   hydrophilicity, mechanical and swelling properties of the hydrogel (e.g. PEG, NVP,
   MAA).      Non-limiting examples of polymers include 2-Hydroxyethyl methacrylate,
   polyacrylamide, N-vinylpyrrolidone, N,N-Dimethylacrylamide, poly(ethylene glycol)
   monomethacrylate (of varying molecular weights), diethylene glycol methacrylate, N
15 (2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide, glycerol monomethacrylate, 2,3-dihydroxypropyl
   methacrylate and combinations thereof.         Non-limiting examples of cross-linkers
   include tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate, poly(ethylene glycol) (n) diacrylate (of
   varying molecular weights), ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate, bisacrylamide
   and combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of initiators include Irgacure Series
20 (UV), Azobisisobutyronitrile       (AIBN)   (thermal), Ammonium Persulfate (APS)
   (thermal).
   [0049]           In a specific embodiment, the polymer is a luminescent hydrogel
   prepared by co-polymerization of HEMA and compound of Formula 1. In a preferred
   embodiment, the hydrogel is prepared by co-polymerization of various molar amounts
25 of compound of Formula 2 mixed with 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)
   monomer, tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) crosslinker, Irgacure 651
   initiator, water and co-solvent, followed by UV-initiated polymerization. In another
   embodiment, the polymer contains 1 mM final concentration of Compound of
   Formula 1. In a specific embodiment, the polymer is an oxygen sensing poly(2
30 hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) scaffold prepared by co-polymerization of
   HEMA (2-hydroxyehtyl methacrylate) (50 Wt %), TEGDMA (triethyleneglycol

   WO 2014/160258                                                         PCT/US2014/026183
   dimethacrylate) (1 Wt %1), ethylene glycol (20 Wt%), water (25.5 Wt %), the
   photoinitiator Irgacure 651 (0.5% vol/vol) and 3% of Compound 2.
   [0050]          The polymer of the present invention may be degradable, either by the
   body (biodegradable) or by the application of an external initiator to start or speed up
 5 the degradation process (e.g. UV, ultrasonics, radio frequency, temperature, or other
   exogenous sources to initiate degradation.).     For example, the polymer may be
   biodegradable or bioresorbable or may comprised any biodegradable or bioresorbable
   segments, including but not limited to degradable forms of alginates, poly(lactic acid),
   poly(vinyl alcohol), polyanhydrides, poly(glycolic acid), microporous polyesters,
10 microporous polyethers and cross-linked collagen.      One specific example is UV
   photopolymerization of poly(ethylene glycol)-diacrylate      and acrylated protease
   degradable peptides and VEGF as described by Phelps, et al (2010) Proc. Nat'L. Acad.
   Sci. USA 107(8):3323-3328
   [00511          In one embodiment, polymers provided herein are biocompatible. In
15 another aspect of the invention, the polymers are biodegradable. Degradable
   hydrogels can be synthesized using Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP)
   through co-polymerization of the HEMA with polymerizable luminescent dyes of the
   present invention. Porous sensor scaffolds, based on non-degradable and degradable
   oxygen-sensing hydrogels, can be generated by using a sphere-templating fabrication
20 technique. Degradable and non-degradable HEMA reagents and polymerizable dye
   will be polymerized over templating microspheres, which are subsequently dissolved
   away with solvent to generate desirable non-degradable and degradable scaffolds.
   Briefly, using controlled ATRP, HEMA will be polymerized in the presence of bi
   functional degradable PCL-based ATRP initiator and cross-linker. In this synthesis
25 scheme, pHEMA chains grow at the same rate from both sides of degradable initiator,
   resulting in degradation products with a MW that is half that of the parent polymer.
   By controlling the MW of the parent polymer and the PEG and PCL units in the
   initiator and/or crosslinker, the degradation rate of the polymers can be varied.
   Limiting the MW of the parent polymer to 1 OkDa results in degradation products that
30 can be cleared by the body and an increased degradation rate while still preserving the
   hydrogel's mechanical strength.

   [0052]          In certain embodiments the polymers provided herein are stimuli
   responsive, e.g., temperature or pH-sensitive polymers. One non-limiting example of
   such a stimuli-responsive polymer is a temperature-sensitive polymer derived from
   co-polymerization of NIPAM. Such polymers are useful for implantation of the sensor
 5 comprising said polymers in a desired location within tissue by first dissolving the
   polymer in a suitable for injection media at a lower than body temperature and then
   injecting the resulting solution into the tissue and/or at desired location of the body.
   As the polymer is subjected to a higher (e.g., body) temperature, it precipitates in or
   near the site of the injection where monitoring of oxygen is required.
10         C. Sensors
   [00531          In some embodiments, the polymer of the present invention is
   incorporated into a sensor useful for detection of an analyte. The detection of the
   analyte can be in vitro or in vivo. The remaining sentences of this paragraph describe
   how the word "polymer" is used in section titled "C. Sensors". The polymer may have
15 the molecules of Formula 1 and/or Formula 2 covalently bound to the polymer
   backbone. The molecules of Formula 1 and/or Formula 2 maybe attached to (e.g. via
   a covalent bond or other means) or contained within nanoparticle carriers or
   microparticle carriers or other carriers that are attached to or contained within the
   polymer. Such carriers may be covalently bound to the polymer backbone. The word
20 polymer can be used interchangeably with the word sensor.
    [00541          In one non-limiting example, the polymer is incorporated into an
   oxygen-sensing wound dressing that can be used to monitor the process of wound
   healing, e.g. to constantly and non-invasively assess one of the critical factors of
   healing (i.e. oxygenation).
25  [0055]          In another embodiment, the polymer is incorporated into a powder,
   which is used directly in the wound as a sensor for wound-healing monitoring. The
   sensor of the present invention can also be in the form of an injectable, implant, a
   mesh or sutures to be used in applications which benefit from monitoring of
   oxygenation of skin or the underlying tissue, including, but not limited to wound
30 healing monitoring, skin closure, hernia repair, flap transfer surgeries, reconstructive
    surgery, and other plastic surgery applications. The sensor of the present invention
    can also be used for measurement for microcirculatory dysfunction and peripheral
                                                1 A

   artery disease. Specifically in re-vascularization procedures or upon administration of
   drug, tissue oxygen may be directly monitored. The sensor of the present invention
   can also be used in oncology applications to determine the degree of hypoxia in a
   tissue or an organ. In one embodiment, the sensor is used to monitor tumor growth in
 5 animal, including but not limited to, mouse or rat models used in oncology
   pharmaceutical and diagnostic research and discovery, e.g., cancer therapy dosing or
   monitoring of tumor metabolism. The sensor of the present invention can also be used
   in monitoring the state of pulmonary function, for example in COPD and asthma
   disease states. In yet another embodiment, the sensor is used for exercise or training
10 optimization, e.g., soldier and athlete performance or personal exercise programs. The
   sensor can also be in the form of an oxygen-sensing tattoo.
    [00561         Yet in another embodiment, the sensors of the present invention are
   used in neuroscience monitoring applications, where currently there are no tools
   available for continuous monitoring of oxygen, for example, in subarachnoid
15 hemorrhage monitoring.
    [0057]         In one embodiment, the sensor of the present invention is a solid
   material that could be in form of a slab, rod, cylinder, particle or powder. In a specific
   embodiment, the sensor is in the form of a rod. In another embodiment, the sensor is
   in the form of a cylinder.
20  [00581         In another embodiment, the polymer of the present invention is
   incorporated into a tissue-integrating scaffold to provide a tissue-integrating sensor
   (as described in the US patent application 2012/0265034, incorporated herein by
   reference). The sensors described herein typically comprise a tissue-integrating
   scaffold (also referred to as a matrix) material.      Preferably, the tissue-integrating
25 scaffold of the invention may be constructed with materials and/or micro-architecture
   such that the scaffold promotes tissue-integration and/or vascularization.            For
   example, porous scaffolds provide tissue biomaterial anchoring and promote in
   growth throughout the pores. The resulting "hallway" or "channel" pattern of tissue
   growth are healthy, space-filling masses that persist over time and promote host cell
30 integration.   Most or all of the pores of the biomaterials described herein are
   preferably interconnected (co-continuous).       The co-continuous pore structure of the
   biomaterials promotes space-filling in-growth of cells in the implant, which in turn
                                               1 L'

   limits the foreign body response and leads to long-term (greater than one week and up
   to years) persistence of the implant's ability to act as a sensor. Alternative structures
   that provide tissue integrating scaffolds include fibers (e.g., 1 to 10 or more microns
   in diameter, such as 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more microns), which may be arranged in non
 5 random or random configuration. Tissue-integrating scaffolds (in any configuration)
   can also be formed by multiphoton polymerization techniques. Kaehr et al. (2008)

   [0059]           The polymer of the invention, preferably in the form of a tissue
10 integrating scaffold, may comprise any material in combination with the compound of
   Formula 1 or Formula 2, including but not limited to synthetic polymers, naturally
   occurring substances, or mixtures thereof. Exemplary synthetic polymers include, but
   are not limited to polyethylene glycol (PEG), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA),
   silicone    rubber,     poly([epsilon]-caprolactone)     dimethylacrylate,   polysulfone,
15 (poly)methy methacrylate (PMMA), soluble Teflon-AF, (poly) ethylenetetrapthalate
   (PET, Dacron), Nylon, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamide, polyurethane, and mixtures
   thereof. Exemplary naturally-occurring materials include, but are not limited to,
   fibrous    or   globular    proteins,   complex     carbohydrates,  glycosaminoglycans,
   extracellular matrix, or mixtures thereof. Thus, the polymer scaffold may include
20 collagens of all types, elastin, hyaluronic acid, alginic acid, desmin, versican,
   matricelluar proteins such as SPARC (osteonectin), osteopontin, thrombospondin 1
   and 2, fibrin, fibronectin, vitronectin, albumin, chitosan etc. Natural polymers may be
   used as the scaffold or as an additive.
   [00601           In certain embodiments, the polymer of the invention, preferably in the
25 form of a tissue-integrating scaffold, comprises a hydrogel. For example, the polymer
   may comprise a hydrogel, for example by reacting hydroxyethyl methacrylate
   (HEMA), poly (hydroxyethyl methacrylate),             pHEMA.       Furthermore, various
   comonomers can be used in combination to alter the hydrophilicity, mechanical and
   swelling properties of the hydrogel (e.g. PEG, NVP, MAA). Non-limiting examples
30 of    polymers      include    2-hydroxyethyl      methacrylate,   polyacrylamide,     N
   vinylpyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, poly(ethylene glycol) monomethacrylate

   include tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate, poly(ethylene glycol) (n) diacrylate (of
   varying molecular weights), ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate, bisacrylamide
 5 and combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of initiators include irgacure Series
   (UV),    Azobisisobutyronitrile     (AIBN)    (thermal), Ammonium Persulfate        (APS)
   (thermal).
   [00611           The polymer of the invention, preferably in the form of a tissue
   integrating scaffold, may be a sphere-templated hydrogel, for instance an inverse
10 colloid crystal, for example as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0075752
   to Ratner, et al. or other tissue integrating materials.
   [0062]           The polymer of the invention, preferably in the form of a tissue
   integrating scaffold, may be degradable, either by the body (biodegradable) or by the
   application of an external initiator to start or speed up the degradation process (e.g.
15 UV, ultrasonics, radio frequency, or other exogenous sources to initiate degradation.).
   For example, the polymer may be comprised of any biodegradable or bioresorbable
   polymers, including but not limited to degradable forms of alginates, poly(lactic acid),
   poly(vinyl alcohol), polyanhydrides, poly(glycolic acid), microporous polyesters,
   microporous polyethers and cross-linked collagen.            One specific example is UV

    [0064]          In certain embodiments, the polymer of the invention, preferably in the
10 form of a tissue-integrating scaffold, is constructed such that tissue response modifiers
   are released from the scaffold material to promote or enhance tissue-integration and
   vascularization.
    [0065]          In addition, the polymer of the invention, preferably in the form of a
   tissue-integrating scaffold, may be constructed such that it has conduits, pores or
15 pockets that are hollow or filled with degradable, angiogenic, or other substances (e.g.
   stem cells). As noted above, once in the body, the biodegradation of the material
   filling the conduits, pores or pockets, creates space for tissue, including capillaries to

   pores, or pockets may enhance vessel growth or tissue growth within the scaffold.
20 This architecture promotes new vessel formation and maintains healthy viable tissue
   within and around the implant.
    [0066]          The polymer of the invention, preferably in the form of a tissue
   integrating scaffold, may be constructed such that it is permeable to analytes of
   interest (e.g., oxygen can diffuse into a tissue-integrating hydrogel scaffold and reach
25 the sensing moieties that are embedded within the hydrogel matrix).
    [00671          The polymer of the invention, preferably in the form of a tissue
   integrating scaffold, can be of any suitable form, including, but not limited to block
   like (or any thickness), cube-like, disk-shaped, cylindrical, oval, round, random or
   non-random configurations of fibers and the like. In certain embodiments, the sensor
30 comprises one or more fibers, which may be organized in a non-random fashion (e.g.,
   grid, layered grid, etc.) or in a random fashion.

    [00681         The polymer of the invention, preferably in the form of a tissue
   integrating scaffold, described herein are typically combined with (or made up of)
   sensing moieties that detect one or more analyses. In one embodiment, the sensing
   moiety is the residue of compound of Formula 1 and/or 2 incorporated into the tissue
 5 integrating scaffold.
    [0069]         In another embodiment, the polymer of the invention, preferably in the
   form of a tissue-integrating scaffold, comprises, in addition to the residue of
   compound of Formula 1 and/or Formula 2, a second sensing moiety that produces or
   consumes oxygen, e.g., an oxidase, and the residue of compound of Formula 1 and/or
10 Formula 2 is used to detect the change in the oxygen concentration generated by the
   second sensing moiety. The second sensing moiety can comprise an enzyme, for
   example glucose oxidase (GOx), which is specific for the substrate glucose.         The
   reaction of glucose via enzymatic interaction with glucose oxidase causes oxygen to
   be proportionally consumed and converted to H2 0 2 .         The reduction of 02 in the
15 vicinity of the enzyme can be measured by using an 0 2 -sensitive fluorescent dye, such
   as the molecules of Formula 1 and Formula 2.      These dye molecules are quenched in
   the presence of 02, so the reduction of 02 by the action of GOx, causes an increase in
   fluorescence. The amount of fluorescence emitted from the 02 calibration moieties is
   thus proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sensor.        Oxidases besides
20 glucose oxidase for detection of other analytes besides glucose may include billirubin
   oxidase, ethanol oxidase, lactate oxidase, pyruvate oxidase, histamine oxidase or other
   oxidase to provide specificity to other analytes of interest.
    [00701         The concentration of 02 in the tissue can also vary physiologically,
   thereby changing or limiting the reaction of the oxide enzyme in the sensing moieties.
25 Therefore, the 02 concentration in the sensor can be measured independent of the
   oxidase target concentration. This may be accomplished through physical separation
   on some nanometer, micro on mm scale of 02 reference moieties from the enzyme-0         2
   detection moieties to avoid cross talk. Such a reference measurement of 02 would
   allow corrections to be made to the glucose-specific signal from the oxidase sensing
30 moieties.
    [0071]         In another embodiment, the polymer of the invention, preferably in the
   form of a tissue-integrating scaffold, may be a multi-analyte sensor where oxygen is

   one of two or more analytes detected and reported. In this embodiment, the polymer
   comprises a residue of compound of Formula 1 and/or Formula 2 for detection of
   oxygen, and a second sensing moiety for detection of another substance. Non-limiting
   examples of analytes that may be detected by the sensing moieties include oxygen,
 5 reactive oxygen species, glucose, lactate, pyruvate, cortisol, creatinine, urea, sodium,
   magnesium, calcium, potassium, vasopressin, hormones (e.g., Luteinizing hormone),
   pH, cytokines, chemokines, eicosanoids, insulin, leptins, small molecule drugs,
   ethanol, myoglobin, nucleic acids (RNAs, DNAs), fragments, polypeptides, single
   amino acids and the like.
10 [0072]           In another embodiment, the polymer of the invention, preferably in the
   form of a tissue-integrating scaffold, may be a sensor where the oxygen signal, as
   detected by Formula 1 and/or Formula 2, is used as a reference to correct or calibrate
   the signal for one or more other analytes. The oxygen signal may or may not be
   reported. It may be used only in internal algorithms to calibrate or correct the signal
15 of the other analyte. The use of the oxygen signal as a reference in this embodiment
   helps to overcome physiological fluctuations, which may alter the analyte availability
   at the site of the sensor (e.g. blood flow variations).
   [00731           In still further embodiments, the sensing moieties, in addition to the
   residue of compound of Formula 1 and/or Formula 2 comprise a second luminescent
20 analyte sensing moiety, and the residue of the compound of Formula 1 and/or
   Formula 2 is used as a reference molecule. The non-oxygen sensing moieties may
   utilize analyte-specific moieties such as competitive binding assays (e.g. a ligand
   receptor moiety and an analyte analogue moiety such as Concanavalin A and
   dextran), reversible luminescent binding molecules (e.g. boronic acid based sensing
25 chemistry for glucose detection), binding proteins such as glucose binding proteins.
   To measure an analyte such as glucose in the tissue, the polymer is illuminated from a
   patch reader on top of the skin above the implant with 650nm light at desired intervals
   over the long-term life of the implant (e.g., every 5-60 minutes over a period of 90
   days or more).      The amount of luminescent signal (e.g., from a molecule such as
30 Alexafluor 647) detected is proportional to the concentration of analyte (e.g. glucose)
   in the tissue. The amount of luminescent signal (e.g. from Formula 1 or Formula 2
   molecule) detected is proportional to the concentration of 02 in the tissue.         The
                                                "%f%

   concentration of 02 in the tissue is indicative of acute and or chronic physiological
   changes around the sensor, and may be used to correct or adjust the glucose signal or
   other analyte signal through a porportionality algorithm.
    [00741         In another embodiment, internal reference control materials can be
 5 employed that facilitate correcting for tissue optical variation. The tissue-integrating
   implanted biosensor typically resides 3-4 mm under the surface of the scan. It is well
   known that in skin excitation light and emitted fluorescent light in the near infrared
   range are highly scattered as the light traverses the tissue between the reader patch
   and the implant.     The extent of absorption and scattering is affected by physical
10 properties such as temperature or by tissue composition, including but not limited to
   variations in blood perfusion, hydration, and melanin concentration. Skin variations
   can occur between users or between different time points for a single patient, and
   these variations can affect the fluorescence excitation and emissions signals causing
   in accurate signals for the analyte-specific signal.          Accordingly, a separate
15 fluorescence molecule with emission spectra distinguishable from the analyte-specific
   fluorescence can be immobilized into the scaffold.         The fluorescence from the
   molecule can be measured separately from the analyte-specific fluorescence to
   measure a signal that informs about variations in tissue composition.          The dye
   selected is based on having a similar response to tissue variations as the analyte
20 specific dye.    Formula 1 or Formula 2 may have the oxygen sensing capabilities
   greatly reduced or eliminated, for example, by incorporation in a non-oxygen
   diffusive environment such as embedding in highly crosslinked PAN or inside a silica
   shell. In this format, the dye molecules of this invention may serve as the stable
   internal reference control materials described above.
25 [0075]          Tissue-integrating sensors comprised of one or more cylindrical shaped
   elements (e.g., fibers) eliminate or greatly reduce the foreign body response as
   compared to currently available implants. Moreover, the average diffusion distances
   from the capillary supply to all parts of the sensing media are comparable to native
   tissue, unlike other known sensors.
30 10076]          It will be apparent that the overall dimensions of the sensing media
   (implantable sensor) will vary according to the subject and/or the analyte(s) to be
   measured.     Typically, the implant will be between about .001 mm to 2 mm in

   thickness (or any value therebetween) and between 1 mm and 1 cm in diameter (or an
   equivalent cross sectional area of a non-circular shape, for example length/width) and
    15 mm in length or less, for example, a disk shaped sensor that is 2 mm or less thick
   and 10 mm or less in diameter. In certain embodiments, the approximate sensor size
 5 is approximately 100-1000 microns in diameter and has the length of between 0.25
   mm and 10 mm. The size of the tissue-integrating sensing media in disk form is
   typically 2 mm or less thick and 10 mm or less in diameter.
   [00771           Another aspect of the present invention is a tissue-integrating
   biosensor system for semi-continuous, continuous and/or long-term use within a
10 mammalian body.
   [00781           One advantageous property of the polymers of the present invention is
   their stability. In one aspect of the invention, the sensor is stable in a mammalian
   tissue for a long period of time, e.g., longer than a week, longer than a month, longer
   than 6 months. In one exemplary embodiment, as shown by the FIGURE 2, the sensor
15 is stable and produces a stable signal when implanted into the rat skin for 170 days.

   Example 2: Production of an oxygen sensing media with oxygen sensitive
 5 luminescent dye immobilized in a tissue-integrating hydrogel scaffold
   100881           The following describes one method for making a tissue-integrating
   sensor as described herein. This method involves the use of non-crosslinked PMMA
   templating microspheres and pHEMA as the scaffold material. The PMMA
   microsphere template was prepared using monodispersed PMMA spheres (20-100
10 um, preferably 80 um) and placing the template beads between two glass slides with
   Teflon spacers. The sintering process included sonicating for at least 10 minutes (one
   or more times) to closely pack the beads. Following sonication, the template is heated
   to a sufficient temperature for a sufficient time to fuse the beads (typically, to 140
   180'C for 20 - 32 hours, for example, heat to approximately 177'C for 24 hours). For
15 each lot of the beads, the temperature and heating times are optimized.
   [00891           The general preparation of an oxygen sensing poly(2-hydroxyethyl
   methacrylate) (pHEMA) scaffold was performed as follows: HEMA (2-hydroxyehtyl
   methacrylate) (50 Wt %), TEGDMA (triethyleneglycol-dimethacrylate) (1 Wt %1),
   ethylene glycol (20 Wt%), water (25.5 Wt %), the photoinitiator Irgacure 651 (0.5%
20 vol/vol) and 3% of Palladium-tetramethacrylate-benzoporphyrin                (Compound 2,
   polymerizable 02 sensitive dye) were mixed, yielding a final concentration of 1 mM
   Compound 2 in the polymer precursor solution.              Polymer, solvents and sensing
   reagents were mixed to achieve sufficiently high sensing chemistry concentration to
   measurably detect a change in signal through tissue.

   WO 2014/160258                                                         PCT/US2014/026183
   [0090]          The pre-mixed monomer solution was filled into the PMMA mold.
   The solution was placed under vacuum to remove any bubbles and to completely
   infiltrate the PMMA-mold. Polymerization was initiated by exposing the mold to UV
   light (280 - 320 nm, 10 - 300 mW/cm2) for 5-10 minutes.              Next, the PMMA
 5 microspheres were dissolved out of the resulting polymer by frequent exchange of
   dichloromethane or other solvent system for 24-48 hours using a Soxhlet extractor by
   manual volume changes.
   [0091]          The following describes preparation of the rod hydrogel sensors. 100
   ptL of a 10 mM solution of Compound 2 in DMSO, was added to a polymer precursor
10 solution [2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (0.5 mL, 4.1 mmol), tetraethyleneglycol
   dimethacrylate (10 ptL, 34 ptmol), ethylene glycol (0.2 mL), water (185 ptL) and 2,2
   dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (5 mg, 2 ptmol)], yielding a final concentration of 1
   mM Compound 2. The dye and polymer precursor mixture was injected into a
   poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bead-containing glass mold, as previously
15 described by Marshall, A.J. et al. (Biomaterials with Tightly Controlled Pore Size that
   Promote Vascular In-Growth. ACS Polymer Preprints 45, 100-101 (2004)). The mold
   was placed under vacuum to remove any bubbles and to ensure complete filling.
   Polymerization was initiated by exposing the mold to UV light (280-320 nm) using a
   Dymax 2000-EC Flood Curing System equipped with a 400 Watt Mercury bulb for 2
20 minutes per side at a distance of approximately 6". The glass plates were removed and
   the hydrogel was soaked in 50 mL of CH 2 Cl 2 (exchanged twice) with shaking for 24
   hours to extract out the PMMA beads. The hydrogel was transferred into water and
   placed under vacuum for 5 minutes to fully hydrate the porous scaffold.             For
   implantation, the hydrogels were cut into rods (10 mm in length with a 750 ptm X 750
25 ptm cross-section), disinfected by exposure to 70% ethanol, and then stored in sterile
   pH 7.4 PBS at 4 'C before use. Non-porous (i.e., solid) hydrogel sensors were
   prepared analogously but without the use of templating beads.
   [00921          Hydrogels comprising Glucose oxidase (GOx) were also prepared as
   described above except GOx was also included in the polymerization mixture used to
30 prepare the scaffold (FIGURE 5).
   Example 3: Determination of excitation and emission wavelengths of Compound
   2 incorporated into a hydrogel.

   WO 2014/160258                                                       PCT/US2014/026183
    [0093]        The absorption and emission spectra of the dye-containing hydrogels
   generated in Example 2 were measured in pH 7.4 PBS at ambient atmosphere using a
   fluorescence plate reader (FIGURE 1). The absorption spectra contained a Soret band
   at 445 nm and a   Q  band at 633 nm. Excitation at 633 nm gave an emission peak at
 5 805 nm, thus confirming that Pd-BP (Compound 2) exhibits both absorption and
   emission in the NIR.
   Example 4: Determination of optimal dye concentration in hydrogel.
    [0094]        To determine the minimum dye concentration required to achieve a
   maximum intensity signal, a series of pHEMA hydrogels containing various
10 concentrations of Pd-BP (Compound 2) were made.           Solid and porous pHEMA
   hydrogels containing covalently-bound Pd-BP (Compound 2) at 0.01, 0.1, 1, 2, and 3
   mM dye concentrations were prepared.       All gels were ~1 mm thick; porous gels
   contained an average pore size of ~ 70 ptm. While in pH 7.4 PBS in ambient air, the
   fluorescence emission of each gel was measured at 805 nm (633 mu excitation) using
15 a fluorescence plate reader.    From these data, the optimal dye concentration was
   determined to be 1 mM, since signal saturation was observed at higher concentrations.
   Example 5: Characterization of photobleaching of NIR benzoporphyrin.
   [0095]         Hydrogels containing covalently-bound Compound 2 were used in
   photobleaching studies to determine the photostability of Compounds 2 and 9. The
20 hydrogels were tested in a custom-built flow-through system intended to simulate
   physiological conditions (pH 7.4 PBS, 37 0 C, 21% 02) while being illuminated by
   LED. The excitation light was directly delivered to the bottom face of the gel samples
   via 1 mm diameter fiber optic cables.      Hydrogels containing Compound 9 were
   excited with a 525 mn LED source (power = 127 mW/cm 2 ) having a pulse duration
25 (LED "on time") of 2 seconds and a pulse period of 5 seconds to achieve an overall
   duty cycle of 40% , while Compound 2 containing hydrogels were excited with a 630
    rnm LED source (power   =  143 mW/cm 2) with the same duty cycle.    The experiment
   was run for 15 continuous hours under these conditions. However, less than 5%
   change in the lifetime signal of Compound 2 was observed. The resulting data from
30 this experiment is used to estimate the expected degree and rate of photobleaching
   which can occur during long-term in vivo use.

   WO 2014/160258                                                           PCT/US2014/026183
    [00961         Gels containing the dye were extremely photostable when tested under
   simulated use conditions (FIGURE 6). These data indicate that measurement of the
   lifetime signal is a preferable strategy to achieve long-term (5 months) stability in
   vivo. Photostability of the Pd-BP compound may be further improved using
 5 techniques elsewhere disclosed, e.g. changing the metal core, or fluorinating or
   perfluorinating the base compound.
   Example 6: Implantation
   [0097]          A tissue integrating sensor produced in rods that are 300-500 um in
   diameter and 5 mm long are placed in a 19-23 Gauge insertion needle, trochar,
10 modified biopsy device or other devices engineered for injection under the skin. The
   sensor is optionally dehydrated or compressed before insertion to allow for the use of
   a smaller insertion needle.
   [00981          Upon insertion, skin is pinched up so that the insertion needle is placed
   parallel to the surface of the skin up to 4 mm beneath the surface. Fluid or a reverse
15 displacement plunger (or trochar) is used to leave the sensor in the tissue as the
   syringe is withdrawn. Insertion site may include any subcutaneous or dermal area,
   typically the abdomen, arm and thigh (FIGURE 4). In research models, the dorsal
   skin, abdomen, hindlimb and brain (FIGURE 3) have all been explored. The
   following describes an example of hydrogel implantation, in-vivo fluorescent
20 imaging, and data analysis in a rat model.
   [00991          Hydrogel implantation and in vivo fluorescent imaging. Hydrogel
   sensors (n = 3 to 4 porous and n   =  3 to 4 solid), were injected into the subcutaneous
   tissue of 12 adult male CD rats (Charles River Labs, 150-250 g) for 1 week, 4 weeks,
   or 170 days. Rats were anesthetized with 2-3% isoflurane (v/v in oxygen) during
25 sensor injection. Porous and solid hydrogel rods (10 mm long, 750 pm x 750 ptm
   cross-section) were loaded into 18 gauge needles and then inserted into the dorsal
   subcutaneous space perpendicular to the midline. Sensors were ejected from the
   needle by inserting a stainless steel plunger through the cannula. Hydrogel sensors
   were implanted approximately 1.5 cm apart. Rats grew normally and showed no
30 discomfort during the weeks following the sensor injection.

   WO 2014/160258                                                       PCT/US2014/026183
   [001001         Oxygen sensors were fluorescently imaged once every 30 seconds in
   vivo with the IVIS Spectrum or Kinetic imaging system (Perkin Elmer, Waltham,
   MA, USA). Rats were anesthetized at 2% isoflurane in 1.00 F102 for 30 minutes prior
   to imaging. During in vivo imaging, the F102 was at least twice modulated down to
 5 0.12 (v/v balance N2) for 5-10 minutes and then returned to 1.00 for 10-15 minutes.
   The relative response (intensity) of each sensor was quantified by identifying regions
   of interest (ROls) surrounding the sensors and measuring the average radiant
   efficiency in the ROI using the Living Image Software included with the IVIS
   System.
10 [001011         On the day of implantation, the Oxford Optronics OxyLite system was
   used as a reference for tissue oxygenation. A needle-encased OxyLite probe was
   inserted subcutaneously in the dorsum of the rat on the day of sensor injection (DO)
   and was allowed 10-15 minutes for the signal to reach a steady-state before data
   collection as described by Braun, et. al. (Comparison of tumor and normal tissue
15 oxygen tension measurements using OxyLite or microelectrodes in rodents. Am J
   Physiol HeartCirc Physiol 280, H2533-2544 (2001)).
   [001021         Data analysis and statistical tests. The data for each sensor, as
   defined by the ROI, was normalized to the maximum and minimum average radiant
   efficiency and inverted to have a positive correlation between the fluorescence data
20 and tissue oxygenation. This normalization ensured that data for every sensor for each
   separate experiment fell between 0 and 1, which were the maximum and minimum
   intensity of the sensor, respectively.
   [00103]         The sensors often did not reach a plateau during hypoxia testing
   because animal health concerns necessitated the short exposure times (5-10 min).
25 Therefore, to calculate the response time of the sensors, the time to achieve 90% of
   the fluorescent intensity change (T90%) during either the 10 min hypoxic (FIO2 =
   0.12) or the 15 min hyperoxic (FIO2    = 1.00) event was determined. The sensors were
   declared to have reached a steady state if there was less than 10% of the total change
   over the last 3 minutes of the F102 change event. Data was tested for statistical
30 significance using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test (p < 0.05).

    [00104]        Histological analysis. Rats were sacrificed and the sensors and
   surrounding tissue were explanted and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and
   stored at -80 C. Frozen tissue samples were cryosectioned at 10 ptm thickness on a
   Leica CM1850 cryostat and mounted on poly L-lysine coated glass slides. Sections
 5 were immunostained for rat CD31 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Briefly, slides
   were fixed in acetone for 20 min at room temperature, rinsed in lx PBS, blocked with
   staining buffer (5% normal donkey serum in 1x PBS) for 30 min, incubated with
   mouse-derived rat CD31 primary antibody at 1:200 in staining buffer for 1 h, and
   incubated with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min,
10 and stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) for 5 min at room temperature. Samples
   were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and imaged on the same day. Samples were
   fluorescently imaged using a Zeiss AxioSkop II+ fluorescence microscope equipped
   with a 12 bit CCD camera (Qlmaging) and an automated scanning stage (Marzhauser)
   driven by a Ludl Mac5000 driving unit (Ludl). An array of micrographs was acquired
15 using a 5x objective (NA 0.25, Zeiss) and then stitched together to form a montage
   using Metamorph software. Exposures were set at low illumination intensities with
   lx1 binning (pixel size of 1.36 pim x 1.36 pim) and a typical acquisition period of 100
   ms. The results of the experiment are depicted in FIGURE 11.
   Example 7: Measurement
20 [00105]        Data from the sensor is collected by a fluorescent reader placed on the
   surface of skin directly above the sensor location, and the data is processed and
   displayed on a smart phone, other hand-held device, computer screen or other
   visualization format, for example using commercially available data display devices.
   Raw data is converted to an analyte concentration or some non-quantitative
25 representation of the analyte concentration (e.g. high, low, within range). Values at
   any given point in time or trends (graphs over time) or summary statistics over a
   period of time are provided.    An indication of the quality of the data is optionally
   provided. Hydrogels prepared from co-polymerization of HEMA with NIR Pd-BP and
   green-ex Pd-TCPP were subcutaneously          implanted in a rat carcass, and their
30 emission was measured (FIGURE 2). Pd-BP was significantly brighter than Pd-TCPP
   due to the NIR excitation and emission wavelengths, which allow much greater light
   penetration into the skin, enabling deeper sensor placement.     Deeper placement is
   desirable for better immunological response, but was not possible previously because

   WO 2014/160258                                                        PCT/US2014/026183
   the original green Pd-TCPP signal was largely blocked, e.g., scattered and/or
   absorbed, by the skin. Only shallow dermal implants were possible. Additionally, Pd
   BP hydrogel sensors produced bright detectable signal when implanted deep under a
   mouse skull (inside mouse brain).
 5 Example 8: Stability of sensors implanted in rat skin.
   [00106]          Oxygen sensors were implanted in rat skin and the intensity of their
   signal was monitored for 170 days. FIGURE 4 shows fluorescence of the sensor
   implanted in a mouse skin for 170 days. Intensity varied as a function of implantation
   depth (data was normalized to baseline fluorescence). Inhaled oxygen was modulated
10 between 100% and 12% and images were collected every 30 s in a Caliper IVIS
   (Spectrum, Ex = 640 nm, Em=800 nm, 20 nm bandwidth). Regions of interest (ROIs)
   were drawn around the sensors and the data plotted versus time (FIGURE 6). This
   data illustrate that the sensors made with the dyes of the present invention maintain
   function for many months in vivo. Additionally, the tissue-integrating sensor was
15 compared to a solid sensor. The tissue-integrating sensor produced a faster kinetic
   response to changes in oxygen levels than the solid sensor, which illustrates another
   advantageous property of the tissue-integrating sensor.
   Example 9: In-vitro oxygen detection in low oxygen concentrations.
   [00107]          To characterize oxygen sensitivity of Pd-BP, the intensity and
20 luminescence lifetime of the dye in a porous HEMA hydrogel at various 02 levels
   (0%, 12%, and 20% 02) was measured (FIGURE 8). The hydrogels were tested in a
   custom-built flow-through system (pH 7.4 PBS, 37'C) while being monitored with the
   TauTheta fiber-optic instrument. The dye showed good reversibility, as well as good
   02  sensitivity as indicated by the Stern-Volmer plot.

   [00108]          Glucose oxidase (GOx) was entrapped in a pHEMA hydrogel
   containing covalently bound Pd-BP as described above. The porous morphology of
   the resulting sensor was confirmed with SEM (FIGURE 5). The GOx-Pd-BP sensors
   were tested for glucose response in a flow-through system (PBS, 37"C).            The
30 luminescence intensity and lifetime of Pd-BP within the gel were monitored during a
   series of glucose excursions spanning the physiological range (FIGURE 9). The slight

   dip in intensity and lifetime during the plateaus (where glucose concentration was
   held constant) are due to consumption of glucose within the test reservoir by GOx.

   injected into a pig. Sensor signals were obtained. Fluorescence lifetime and intensity
   measurements were collected. After sensor signal measurements were obtained, the
   pig was sacrificed and specimens were fixed in 10% Formalin and stained with
   Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). Images and depth measurements were obtained using
10 a Nikon microscope at 40X magnification and the Infinityl microscopy camera and
   software (Version 6.1.0, Luminera Corp.) Sequential overlapping images were
   obtained to create the final composite images. FIGURE 10 depicts a sensor that was
   found to have been implanted at 8 mm in depth under the surface of the skin.
