[0001]           This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) of U.S. patent
application no. 61/785,098, filed March 14, 2013, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by

                                          BACKGROUND
[0002]           The present invention relates to messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs)
comprising 4'-thio-modified nucleotide residues, compositions comprising those mRNAs, and
methods of making and using same.
[0003]           Gene therapy using messenger RNA has been proposed as an approach for the
treatment of a variety of diseases. The concept of introduction of messenger RNA (mRNA) as a
means of protein production within a host has been reported previously. Yamamoto, A. et al.
Eur. J. Pharm. 71:484-489 (2009); Debus, H. et al. J. Control Rel. 148:334-343 (2010).
However, successful administration of mRNA for in vivo protein production typically required
mRNA being packaged (such as, e.g., mRNA complexed with a polymer or lipid carrier). See,
e.g., International Patent Appl. Publ. Nos. WO 2011/06810 and WO 2012/170930.
Administration of unpackaged (naked) mRNA required chemically-modified nucleotides to be
incorporated within an mRNA to result in a more stable and beneficial therapeutic. See, e.g., M.
Kormann et al. Nature Biotech. 29:154-159 (2011); K. Kariko, Molecular Therapy 16(11):1833
1840 (2008).
[0004]           The administration of mRNAs encoding a therapeutic protein that can be
produced in vivo may provide significant advantages over administration of DNA encoding the
therapeutic protein as well as direct administration of the therapeutic protein. However, while
the development of therapeutic mRNAs encoding therapeutic proteins represents a promising

advancement in medical therapies, the utility of such treatments can still be limited by the poor
stability of mRNAs in vivo, particularly those encoding full length proteins.
[00051           In particular, poor stability of mRNAs used in gene replacement therapy can
result in insufficient or less optimal production of the encoded therapeutic protein in vivo.
Following the administration of an mRNA that encodes a therapeutic protein, the mRNA may
undergo degradation, for example upon exposure to one or more nucleases in vivo.
Ribonucleases (e.g., endoribonucleases and exoribonucleases) represent a class of nuclease
enzymes that are capable of catalyzing the degradation of RNA into smaller components and
thereby render the mRNA unable to produce the therapeutic protein. Nuclease enzymes (e.g.,
RNase) are therefore capable of shortening the circulatory half-life of, for example, synthetically
or recombinantly-prepared mRNAs. Following nucleolytic degradation, an mRNA is not
translated, and thus, is prevented from exerting an intended therapeutic benefit, which can
significantly reduce the efficacy of the mRNA gene therapy.
                                               SUMMARY
[0006]           The present invention provides an improved modified mRNA for more stable,
robust and sustained in vivo protein production. The present invention is based, in part, on the
realization that the stability of mRNA used to produce therapeutic proteins in vivo can be further
improved by incorporating modified ribonucleotides in which the 4' oxygen in the ribose moiety
is substituted by a sulfur. Although substitution of the 4' oxygen in the ribose moiety of
ribonucleotides with a sulfur has been reported previously by S. Hoshika et al. (Nuc. Ac. Res.
Supp. 3:209-210 (2003)) and M. Takahashi, M. et al. (Nuc. Ac. Res. 37:1353-1362 (2009)), both
reports involved short synthetic segments of RNA containing 4'-thio residues of at most 15
residues in length for RNA interference; short RNAs of 19-21 residues comprising 4'-thio
modified nucleotides have also been reported for RNA interference (Dande et al., J. Med. Chem.
49:1624-1634 (2006)) and for developing aptamers (up to 59 residues in length; Hoshika et al.,
Nuc. Ac. Res. 32:3815-3825(2004); Kato et al., Nuc. Ac. Res. 33:2942-2951 (2005); Minakawa
et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 16:9450-9456 (2008)). These reports, however, are not predictive of

the effect of incorporating 4'-thioribonucleotides into a full length mRNA (that is, an mRNA
encoding a full length functional therapeutic protein and optionally containing one or more
noncoding regions), which generally has a length much longer than any of the interfering RNAs
or aptamers tested in the prior art and does not exist in a uniformly duplexed state and may adopt
a conformation with a large non-helical and/or single-stranded component. More importantly, it
was unclear if mRNAs incorporating 4'-thio-modified nucleotides could be successfully used for
in vivo protein production prior to the present invention. As described herein including the
examples, the present inventors have successfully synthesized full length mRNAs incorporating
one or more 4'-thio-modified nucleotides (e.g., 4'-thio-ATPs, 4'-thio-UTPs, 4'-thio-GTPs,
and/or 4'-thio-CTPs). Despite the concern over the length of mRNAs, the present inventors were
able to synthesize full length mRNAs incorporating up to 100% 4'-thio-ATPs, 100% 4'-thio
UTPs, 100% 4'-thio-GTPs, and/or 100% 4'-thio-CTPs. As shown in the Examples, such
modified mRNAs are more stable than unmodified mRNAs and surprisingly, such extensive
modifications do not appear to impact the ability of modified mRNAs to be effectively translated
in vivo.
[00071          Accordingly, the present invention provides mRNAs that allow better control
over, for example, the stability, immunogenicity, and translational efficiency of the mRNA, and
compositions comprising those mRNAs and, optionally, a carrier, as well as methods of using
those mRNAs and compositions to induce expression of a therapeutic protein in vivo for
treatment of diseases and/or disorders.
[0008]          In some embodiments, the invention provides an mRNA molecule having a
coding region and optionally, one or more non-coding regions, wherein the mRNA comprises at
least one nucleotide residue that incorporates a 4'-thio-substituted furanose ring. In some

50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 7 0%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100%

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0024]           As used herein, the term "mRNA" is used to refer to modified and/or unmodified
RNA including a coding region and, optionally, a noncoding region. The term "coding region"
refers to a portion or region of the mRNA that can be translated into a chain of amino acids, i.e.,
two or more amino acids linked by peptide bonds. A chain of amino acids is also referred to as a
peptide or a polypeptide, which can fold into a protein (e.g., a therapeutic protein). The term
"noncoding region" refers to a portion or region of the mRNA that are typically not translated.
Noncoding region typically includes 5' untranslated region and/or 3' untranslated region
including but not limited to a poly(A) or poly(U) tail.
[00251           A "nonstandard nucleobase" is a base moiety other than the natural bases adenine
(A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T), or uracil (U). The nonstandard nucleobase is an
analog of a specific nucleobase (A, C, G, T, or U) when its base pairing properties in a nucleic
acid double helix and locus of incorporation by DNA or RNA polymerases in a nucleic acid
double helix (including a local RNA-DNA helix such as that formed during transcription of a
DNA template by RNA polymerase) are most similar to one of the five previously listed
nucleobases, with the exception that analogs of T will generally also be analogs of U and vice
versa. The term "nonstandard" used in conjunction with terms including but not limited to
"nucleoside," "base," "nucleotide," or "residue" is to be interpreted in the same manner as if it
were used in conjunction with "nucleobase."
[0026]           As used herein, the term "therapeutic protein" includes any protein that, if
administered to a subject, provides a beneficial effect on the health and well-being of the subject.

     WO 2014/152513                                                            PCT/US2014/027422
Attorney Docket No.: 2006685-0457
In some embodiments, a deficiency, lack of, or aberrant expression of that protein in a subject
gives rise to a disease or condition. "Therapeutic protein" may also refer to a protein that is not
normally present or is not normally present in sufficient quantities in a subject to achieve a
desired therapeutic effect.
[00271           The term "helper lipid" as used herein refers to any neutral or zwitterionic lipid
material including cholesterol. Without wishing to be held to a particular theory, helper lipids
may add stability, rigidity, and/or fluidity within lipid bilayers/nanoparticles.
[0028]           The mRNAs of the invention employ specific chemically-modified bases, in
which the 4' oxygen in the ribose moiety of a nucleotide residue is replaced with sulfur, for
substitution into a messenger ribonucleic acid molecule to enhance its biological properties upon
administration to a subject. Exemplary 4'-thio modified nucleotide residues for incorporation
into an mRNA of the invention are depicted in Figure 1 (showing modified nucleotide residues
containing a thio-substituted furanose ring). In some embodiments, 4'-thio modification of the
furanose ring provides improved resistance to exonucleases, endonucleases, and/or other RNA
degradation enzymes in human serum. Such stability can afford an increased RNA half-life.
Thus, for example, administration of an mRNA having a 4'-thio modification in the furanose
ring or a composition comprising such mRNA results in cellular uptake of an mRNA having
improved biological properties, e.g., increased half-life, which in turn contributes to increased
protein production in vivo.
[0029]           In certain embodiments, at least 1% of the adenosine nucleotide residues in the
RNA have a 4'-thio modification in the furanose ring. For example, about 1-5%, 5-15%, 15
30%, 30-50%, 50-75%, 75-90%, 90-99%, or 99-100% of the adenosine in the mRNA can be 4'
thio-adenosine.
[0030]           In some embodiments, at least about 1%, about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about
20%,about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about
60%,about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about
96%,about 97%, about 98% or about 99% of the adenosine residues in the mRNA are 4'-thio
adenosine. In some embodiments, about 100% of the adenosine residues in the mRNA are 4'
thio-adenosine.

thio-guanosine.

[0056]           As used herein, the term "carrier" includes any of the standard pharmaceutical
carriers, vehicles, diluents, excipients and the like which are generally intended for use in
connection with the administration of biologically active agents, including mRNA. The
compositions and, in particular, the carriers described herein are capable of delivering and/or
stabilizing mRNA of varying sizes to their target cells or tissues. In certain embodiments, the
compositions of the invention comprise carriers that are capable of delivering large mRNAs
(e.g., mRNAs of at least 5kDa, 1OkDa, l2kDa, l5kDa, 20kDa, 25kDa, 30kDa, or more, or of at
least 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 2,500,
3,000, 3,500, 4,000, 4,500, 5,000, 5,500, 6,000, 6,500, or 7,000 residues in length). mRNAs
according to the present invention may be synthesized according to any of a variety of known
methods. For example, mRNAs according to the present invention may be synthesized via in
vitro transcription (IVT). Briefly, IVT is typically performed with a linear or circular DNA
template containing a promoter, a pool of ribonucleotide triphosphates including desired
amount(s) of 4'-thio-modified standard and/or non-standard ribonucleotides (e.g., one or more
desired 4'-thio-NTP(s)) and optionally, mixed with unmodified ribonucleotide triphosphates, a
buffer system that may include DTT and magnesium ions, and an appropriate RNA polymerase
(e.g., T3, T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase), DNAse I, pyrophosphatase, and/or RNAse inhibitor.
The exact conditions will vary according to the specific application. It is observed that 4'-thio
modified standard and/or non-standard ribonucleotides may be effectively incorporated into a
full length mRNA of any length.
[00571           In some embodiments, for the preparation of mRNA according to the invention, a
DNA template is transcribed in vitro. A suitable DNA template typically has a promoter, for
example a T3, T7 or SP6 promoter, for in vitro transcription, followed by desired nucleotide
sequence for encoding a protein of interest and a termination signal. Typically, mRNA
synthesis includes the addition of a "cap" on the N-terminal (5') end, and a "tail" on the C
terminal (3') end. The presence of the cap is important in providing resistance to nucleases
found in most eukaryotic cells. The presence of a "tail" serves to protect the mRNA from
exonuclease degradation.
[0058]           Thus, in some embodiments, mRNAs according to the present invention include a
5' cap structure. A 5' cap is typically added as follows: first, an RNA terminal phosphatase

removes one of the terminal phosphate groups from the 5' nucleotide, leaving two terminal
phosphates; guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is then added to the terminal phosphates via a
guanylyl transferase, producing a 5'5'5 triphosphate linkage; and the 7-nitrogen of guanine is
then methylated by a methyltransferase. Examples of cap structures include, but are not limited
to, m7G(5')ppp (5'(A,G(5')ppp(5')A and G(5')ppp(5')G.
[00591           In some embodiments, mRNAs according to the present invention include a 3' tail
structure. A suitable 3' tail structure includes, but is not limited to, a poly-A, poly-U and/or
poly-C tail. Exemplary suitable poly-A, poly-U and poly-C tails are described above. The poly
U or poly-C tail may be added to the poly-A tail or may substitute the poly-A tail.
[0060]           In some embodiments, mRNAs according to the present invention include a 5'
and/or 3' untranslated region. In some embodiments, a 5' untranslated region includes one or
more elements that affect an mRNA's stability or translation, for example, an iron responsive
element. In some embodiments, a 5' untranslated region may be between about 50 and 500
nucleotides in length (e.g., about 50 and 400 nucleotides in length, about 50 and 300 nucleotides
in length, about 50 and 200 nucleotides in length, or about 50 and 100 nucleotides in length).
[0061]           In certain embodiments of the present invention, the carrier may be selected
and/or prepared to optimize delivery of the mRNA to a target cell, tissue or organ. For example,
if the target cell is a pneumocyte the properties of the carrier (e.g., size, charge and/or pH) may
be optimized to effectively deliver such carrier to the target cell or organ, reduce immune
clearance, and/or promote retention in that target organ. Alternatively, if the target tissue is the
central nervous system (e.g., to facilitate delivery of mRNA polynucleotides to targeted brain
region(s) or spinal tissue) selection and preparation of the carrier must consider penetration of,
and retention within, the blood brain barrier and/or the use of alternate means of directly
delivering such carrier to such target tissue. In certain embodiments, the compositions of the
present invention may be combined with agents that facilitate the transfer of exogenous
polynucleotides from the local tissues or organs into which such compositions were administered
to one or more peripheral target organs or tissues.
[0062]           In certain embodiments, the carriers employed in the compositions of the
invention may comprise a liposomal vesicle, or other means to facilitate the transfer of an mRNA

contemplated is the use of bionanocapsules and other viral capsid proteins assemblies as suitable
carriers. (Hum. Gene Ther. 19(9):887-95 (2008)).
[0063]           In certain embodiments of the invention, the carrier is formulated using a polymer
as a carrier, alone or in combination with other carriers. Suitable polymers may include, for
example, polyacrylates, polyalkycyanoacrylates, polylactide, polylactide-polyglycolide
copolymers, polycaprolactones, dextran, albumin, gelatin, alginate, collagen, chitosan,
cyclodextrins, protamine, PEGylated protamine, PLL, PEGylated PLL and polyethylenimine
(PEI), including, but not limited to branched PEI (25 kDa). In some embodiments, a polymer
may be one or more multi-domain-block polymers. In some embodiments, a polymer may
comprise a dry powder formulation of the polymer or polymers.
[0064]           The use of liposomal carriers to facilitate the delivery of polynucleotides to target
cells is also contemplated by the present invention. Liposomes (e.g., liposomal lipid
nanoparticles) are generally useful in a variety of applications in research, industry, and
medicine, particularly for their use as carriers of diagnostic or therapeutic compounds in vivo
(Lasic et al., Trends Biotechnol., 16:307-321 (1998); Drummond et al., Pharmacol. Rev., 51:691
743 (1999)) and are usually characterized as microscopic vesicles having an interior aqua space
sequestered from an outer medium by a membrane of one or more bilayers. Bilayer membranes
of liposomes are typically formed by amphiphilic molecules, such as lipids of synthetic or
natural origin that comprise spatially separated hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains. Bilayer
membranes of the liposomes can also be formed by amphiphilic polymers and surfactants (e.g.,
polymerosomes, niosomes, etc.).

[0070]          In certain embodiments, the mRNAs of the invention and compositions
comprising those mRNAs may be administered in a local rather than systemic manner, for
example, via injection of the pharmaceutical composition directly into a targeted tissue,
preferably in a sustained release formulation. Local delivery can be affected in various ways,
depending on the tissue to be targeted. For example, aerosols containing the mRNAs and
compositions of the invention can be inhaled (for nasal, tracheal, or bronchial delivery); mRNAs
and compositions of the invention can be injected into the site of injury, disease manifestation, or
pain, for example; compositions can be provided in lozenges for oral, tracheal, or esophageal
application; can be supplied in liquid, tablet or capsule form for administration to the stomach or
intestines, can be supplied in suppository form for rectal or vaginal application; or can even be
delivered to the eye by use of creams, drops, or even injection.
[00711          Also contemplated herein are lyophilized pharmaceutical compositions
comprising one or more of the liposomal nanoparticles disclosed herein and related methods for
the use of such lyophilized compositions as disclosed for example, in International Patent
Publication WO 2012/170889, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in
their entirety. For example, lyophilized mRNA and compositions of the invention may be
reconstituted prior to administration or can be reconstituted in vivo. For example, a lyophilized
mRNA and/or composition can be formulated in an appropriate dosage form (e.g., an intradermal
dosage form such as a disk, rod or membrane) and administered such that the dosage form is
rehydrated over time in vivo by the individual's bodily fluids.
[0072]          In certain embodiments, methods of treating a subject comprising administering
an mRNA or composition of the invention are also contemplated. For example, certain
embodiments of the invention provide methods of treating or preventing conditions in which
production of a particular protein and/or utilization of a particular protein is inadequate or
compromised. In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods of modulating
(e.g., increasing, improving or otherwise enhancing) the translational efficiency of one or more
mRNAs in a target cell. As used herein, the phrase "translational efficiency" refers to the extent
to which an mRNA is translated and the encoded therapeutic protein is produced.
[0073]          In certain embodiments, an mRNA molecule of the invention or composition
comprising such mRNA is administered to a patient.

II. Analysis of modified messenger RNA versus unmodified mRNA:
            II-a. Quantification of Modified Base Within Messenger RNA Construct
[0088]           4'-Thio NTP modified messenger RNA are subjected to RNase I or Nuclease P1
for various periods of time to allow for sufficient degradation. Upon completion, the resulting
monophosphate nucleotides are degraded further with alkaline phosphatase to provide the
respective nucleosides. The nucleoside mixture is applied to an Amicon spin column (30,000
MWCO) for efficient enzyme removal. The resulting nucleoside solution is analyzed via HPLC
and quantified via peak area comparison with respective unmodified nucleoside.
            II-b. Stability of 4'-Thio NTP Modified Messenger RNA Construct
[0089]           4'-Thio NTP modified messenger RNA is subjected to RNase I or Nuclease P1
for a various periods of time to assess resistance to nuclease degradation. Similarly, 4'-thio NTP
modified messenger RNA was treated with serum (containing nucleases) over various time
periods to assess nuclease degradation. At specified time points, the nuclease reactions are
quenched with inhibitor and the resulting solution is applied to an Amicon spin column (30,000

[0118]          Quantification of EPO protein was performed following procedures reported for
human EPO ELISA kit (Quantikine IVD, R&D Systems, Catalog # Dep-00). Positive controls
employed consisted of ultrapure and tissue culture grade recombinant human erythropoietin
protein (R&D Systems, Catalog # 286-EP and 287-TC, respectively). Blood samples were taken
at designated time points and processed as described above. Detection was monitored via
absorption (450 nm) on a Molecular Device Flex Station instrument.
[0119]          For analysis of GLA protein, standard ELISA procedures were followed
employing sheep anti-Replagal G-188 IgG as the capture antibody with rabbit anti-Replagal IgG
as the secondary (detection) antibody. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti
rabbit IgG was used for activation of the 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution.
The reaction was quenched using 2N H2 SO 4 after 20 minutes. Detection was monitored via

        Bioluminescence Analysis
[0120]          The bioluminescence assay was conducted using a Promega Luciferase Assay
System (Item # E1500). The Luciferase Assay Reagent was prepared by adding 10 mL of
Luciferase Assay Buffer to Luciferase Assay Substrate and mixed via vortex. 20 uL of
homogenate samples were loaded onto a 96-well plate followed by 20 uL of plate control to each

[0121]          The production of FFL protein via transfection of 4'-thio modified or unmodified
FFL mRNA was tested in HEK 293T cells. Figure 2 represents the weighted relative
fluorescence units (RLU) scores taken 4 hours, 8 hours, 32 hours, 56 hours and 80 hours after
transfection. At each time point, cells transfected with either 25% 4'-thio uridine (25% 4'-S-U)
or 100% 4'-thio uridine (100% 4'-S-U) FFL mRNA had higher weighted RLU scores than cells
transfected with either SNIM* FFL or commercial FFL.
[0122]          The stability of 4'-thio modified and unmodified FFL mRNA over time was also
tested. Three micrograms of mRNA were exposed to mouse serum and monitored over the
course of one hour. As can be seen in Figure 3, compared to SNIM* FFL and commercial FFL
mRNA, 4'-thio modified mRNA, particularly 100% 4'-thio uridine (100% 4'-S-U) FFL mRNA,
appears to be more stable over time.
[0123]          The production of FFL protein via transfection of 4'-thio modified or unmodified
FFL mRNA was tested in wild-type mice. A 1.0 mg/kg dose of C12-200-loaded lipid
nanoparticles was administered intravenously and animals were sacrificed and their livers were
removed for analysis, as described above. Figure 4 represents RLU/mg Total Protein scores
taken six hours post-administration. Livers from mice treated with 25% 4'-thio uridine ( 2 5 % 4'
S-U) and 100% 4'-thio uridine (100% 4'-S-U) had higher RLU/mg scores than the livers from
mice treated with unmodified mRNA.
[0124]          Among other things, the exemplary results described herein demonstrated that a
provided mRNA comprising 4'-thio-modified nucleotide can be successfully synthesized, have
increased stability, and can be used successfully to produce protein in cells.

[01581             The synthesis of the nucleoside 5'-triphosphates is shown above. Nucleoside A is
reacted with phosphoramidite reagent in presence of imidazole.HCl / imidazole in
dimethylformamide followed by subsequent oxidation of the phosphorous with H 2 0 2 to give B in
good yield (after purification by column chromatography on silica gel, typically 60 to 83%
yield). Cleavage of the protecting groups by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid in H 2 0 /
dichloromethane gives the monophosphate C, typically in quantitative yield. Finally the
triphosphate D is obtained using a method developed by Bogachev (Bogachev, V.S. Synthesis of
deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates using trifluoroacetic anhydride as activation reagent. Russ. J.
Bioorg. Chem., 1996, 22, 599-604).

[0161]           To a solution of A (1 eq.), imidazole.HCl (1.5 eq.) and imidazole (1 eq.) in
dimethylformamide (3 ml / mmol of A) is added dropwise di-tert-butyl
diisopropylphosphoramidite (1.5 eq.) at room temperature under argon. The reaction mixture is
stirred until complete consumption of starting material was observed (LC-MS or TLC) (typically
30 - 90 min). The reaction mixture is then cooled in an ice-water bath and treated dropwise with
35% H2 0 2 (2.6 eq.) The reaction mixture is warmed to room temperature and stirred until
complete reaction is observed (LC-MS or TLC); it is then cooled in an ice-water bath and
carefully quenched with saturated aqueous sodium thiosulphate. The product is extracted with
ethyl acetate; the organic layer is washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and
concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography on silica gel with
an appropriate eluent (generally methanol / dichloromethane) gives B, typically in 60 to 85%
yield.
