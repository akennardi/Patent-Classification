                   SENSORY STIMULATION AND DISTRACTION SYSTEM
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]       The present invention relates to sensory stimulation and distraction.
BACKGROUND ART
[0002]       A fidget spinner is generally a device that consists of a multi-lobed body having a
ball bearing in a centre thereof. In use, a central portion of the ball bearing is held between the
fingers (e.g. indirectly using spacers or "buttons"), while the body is spun.
[0003]       Generally, the ball bearing is efficient, and as such, once the body is spinning, it may
spin for considerable time, thus providing either sensory stimulation or distraction to the user. A
fidget spinner may help calm people who suffer from anxiety, or be beneficial in other
circumstances.
[0004]       One problem with fidget spinners of the prior art is that they must be held carefully
in the hand of the user, e.g. between an index finger and thumb. If, for example, the body of the
fidget spinner accidentally makes contact with the palm of the user's hand, it will generally
abruptly stop spinning, and the sensory stimulation or distraction to the user abruptly stops. This
is particularly the case for those that have difficulty holding their hand still, such as children and
those that are particularly fidgety.
[0005]       Furthermore, as the fidget spinners must be held by the user, and the hand partially
shields the fidget spinner, it is difficult to share the sensory stimulation or distraction that the
fidget spinner provides with other users.
[0006]       As such, there is clearly a need for an improved sensory stimulation and distraction
device.
[0007]       It will be clearly understood that, if a prior art publication is referred to herein, this
reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms part of the common general
knowledge in the art in Australia or in any other country.
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
[0008]       The present invention is directed to a sensory stimulation and distraction device and
system, which may at least partially overcome at least one of the abovementioned disadvantages
or provide the consumer with a useful or commercial choice.

[0009]       With the foregoing in view, the present invention in one form, resides broadly in a
sensory stimulation system including: a base, and a spinning device, wherein the base is
configured to levitate the spinning device thereabove while the spinning device is spinning.
[0010]       The spinning device may comprise a multi-lobed body. The spinning device may be
spinnable between fingers of a user. The spinning device may include a ball bearing. The ball
bearing may be ceramic. The spinning device may be substantially, or entirely, non-metallic.
Preferably, the spinning device comprises a fidget spinner.
[0011]       A levitating body engages with a central portion of the spinning device. The
levitating body may engage with a button of the fidget spinner. The base may be configured to
levitate the spinning device indirectly through the levitating body.
[0012]       The levitating body may comprise a magnet. The magnet may comprise a permanent
magnet. The magnet may be encased by a body, which is configured to engage with the spinning
device. Preferably, the body is configured to releasably engage with the spinning device. The
body may engage with the spinning device using a press-fit.
[0013]       The base may comprise at least one permanent lifting magnet configured to engage
with a magnet of the spinning device.
[0014]       The at least one permanent lifting magnet may comprise an annular magnet.
[0015]       The base may include one or more electromagnets, configured to adaptively control a
position of the spinning device. The base may include one or more Hall effect sensors to
adaptively control the electromagnets.
[0016]       The one or more electromagnets may be positioned on an inside of the annular
magnet.
[0017]       The sensory stimulation system may include a replaceable cover. The cover may be
formed of non-magnetic material.
[0018]       The spinning device may be spun independently of the base. The spinning device
may be spun independently of the base and subsequently supported by the base (levitating) while
the spinning device is spinning.
[0019]       Any of the features described herein can be combined in any combination with any
one or more of the other features described herein within the scope of the invention.

[0020]        The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as
an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of the common
general knowledge.

[0027]        Preferred features, embodiments and variations of the invention may be discerned
from the following Detailed Description which provides sufficient information for those skilled
in the art to perform the invention. The Detailed Description is not to be regarded as limiting the
scope of the preceding Summary of the Invention in any way.
DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0028]        Figure 1 illustrates a perspective view of a sensory stimulation and distraction system
100, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Figure 2 illustrates a side view of the
sensory stimulation and distraction system 100.
[0029]        The sensory stimulation and distraction system 100 comprises a base 105, which uses
magnetic levitation device to cause a fidget spinner 110 to levitate while spinning. As such, the
sensory stimulation and distraction system 100 creates sensory stimulation and/or distraction in
that the fidget spinner 110 spins while levitating above the base 105. The sensory stimulation
and distraction system 100 also provides a captivating and eye catching display, which may be

used to attract the attention of customers or other persons.
[0030]       As the user need not hold the fidget spinner 110 (as it is instead supported by the
base 105), the user may view the fidget spinner 110 without needing a steady hand, and even
multiple users may view the fidget spinner 110 together.
[0031]       The fidget spinner 110 comprises a multi-lobed body 115 having a ball bearing (not
visible) in a centre thereof. A pair of buttons 120 engage with an inside of the ball bearing, and
an outside of the ball bearing engages with the body 115. As such, a user may hold the buttons
120 and spin the body 115 relative to the buttons 120.
[0032]       A levitating body 125 engages with a lower button 120 of the fidget spinner 110 such
that the lower button is coupled to the levitating body 125. As such, a levitating force may be
applied to the levitating body 125 by the base 105 such that the levitating body 125 levitates and
supports the lower button 120, and thus the fidget spinner 110.
[0033]       As illustrated in Figure 3, the levitating body 125 comprises a magnet member 125a
which is encased by a body 125b. The body 125b includes a recess 125c on an upper face
thereof to receive and retain an end of the lower button 120. Advantageously, the levitating
body 125 is releasably attached to the fidget spinner 110 by the button 120, which enables the
fidget spinner 110 to be easily adapted for use with the system 100 in a non-permanent manner.
In one example, the button 120 may be press-fitted into the recess 125c.
[0034]       However, the skilled addressee will readily appreciate that adhesive may be used to
permanently attach the levitating body 125 to the fidget spinner 110. In such case, the fidget
spinner 110 may still be used outside of the system 100, and in such case may be held between
an index finger and thumb of the user using on of the buttons 120 and the body 125.
[0035]       As best illustrated in Figure 4, the base 105 comprises an annular permanent magnet
405, which is magnetized vertically (north upwards, south downwards). Similarly, the magnet
member 125a comprises a permanent magnet 410, which is also magnetized vertically (north
upwards, south downwards). A lower end of the permanent magnet 410 is smaller than an upper
end of the permanent magnet 410 to provide stability.
[0036]       As such, the annular permanent magnet 405 of the base 105 pushes up the magnet
member 125a in the levitating body 125, whose north is with the top, because the lines of the
field of magnet 405 are folded up in this zone.

[0037]       The base 105 further comprises a plurality of electromagnets 415, located on an
inside of the annular permanent magnet 405, and configured to generate a magnetic force in the
vertical direction. In particular, the role of the electromagnets 415 is to modify the magnetic
field of the annular permanent magnet 405 according to the position of the levitating body 125
(and thus the fidget spinner 110).
[0038]       As such, if the fidget spinner 110 moves towards one side of the base 105, then a
corresponding electromagnet 415 of that side of the base 105 may present a repulsive south pole
in facing the south pole of the magnet 410. In this regard, one or more Hall effect sensors or
probes may be used as input to control the electromagnets 415 to cause the fidget spinner 110 to
be in a desired location.
[0039]       The base 105 includes a power cable 130 configured to power the electromagnets
415, and control circuitry, as well as other functions of the base 105, such as a light source (e.g.
to illuminate the fidget spinner 110).
[0040]       According to certain embodiments, the electromagnets 415 may be further
configured to engage in a cyclical manner to promote or cause rotation of the fidget spinner 110
in a particular direction. As such, the spinner 110 may be placed on the base 105 (such that it
levitates), and then automatically spin. As a result, the spinner 110 may spin indefinitely.
[0041]       In such case, the base may include a switch or controller enabling the user to
configure a speed of rotation of the fidget spinner, or a direction of rotation of the fidget spinner.
This enables the user to control movement and speed of the fidget spinner to achieve a desired
effect.
[0042]       As the fidget spinner 110 levitates above the base 105, a cover may be provided on
the base 105 and between the base 105 and the fidget spinner 110. The cover in such case is
typically of non-conductive, non-magnetic material, such that it does not provide any magnetic
shielding, or at least minimal magnetic shielding.
[0043]       Figure 5 illustrates a side view of the sensory stimulation and distraction system 500,
according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention. The sensory stimulation and
distraction system 500 is similar or identical to the system 100 with the addition of a cover 505.
[0044]       The cover 505 is illustrated as being substantially rectangular in cross section, but the
skilled addressee will readily appreciate that the cover may take any suitable form. As an
illustrative example, the cover 505 may be 3D printed of ABS plastic such that it takes a

complex three-dimensional shape to provide visual appeal. The cover 505 can, however, be
made according to any suitable method.
[0045]       In one embodiment, the cover 505 may be customisable and replaceable according to
need, without replacing the base. Similarly the fidget spinner 110 may be replaced as needed.
As a result, the visual appearance of the system 500 can be easily changed according to need or
desire.
[0046]       According to certain embodiments, a placement device is provided in the system,
that is used to place the fidget spinner 110 at a desirable position above the base 105. The
placement device may be then removed, upon which the fidget spinner 110 is held in a floating
position above the base. The placement device may be particularly useful in that it simplifies
placement of the fidget spinner 110 on the base 105 for inexperienced or first time users.
[0047]       According to certain embodiments, the system may include an external drive to drive
the fidget spinner. As an illustrative example, the external drive may comprise a compressed air
sources which is configured to blow air onto a side of the fidget spinner causing it to rotate. The
compressed air advantageously enables the fidget spinner to spin at very high speed.
[0048]       In addition to the benefits described above, the systems 100, 500 may reduce stress,
relieve anxiety, assist in sensory-processing issues, for example.
[0049]       In the present specification and claims (if any), the word 'comprising' and its
derivatives including 'comprises' and 'comprise' include each of the stated integers but does not
exclude the inclusion of one or more further integers.
[0050]       Reference throughout this specification to 'one embodiment' or 'an embodiment'
means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the
embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the
appearance of the phrases 'in one embodiment' or 'in an embodiment' in various places
throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.
Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any
suitable manner in one or more combinations.
[0051]       In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more or
less specific to structural or methodical features. It is to be understood that the invention is not
limited to specific features shown or described since the means herein described comprises
preferred forms of putting the invention into effect. The invention is, therefore, claimed in any

of its forms or modifications within the proper scope of the appended claims (if any)
appropriately interpreted by those skilled in the art.
