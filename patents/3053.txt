                                            Background
[0002] Consumers enjoy eating various foods for the taste, nutrients, etc. These foods are
packaged to be preserved for on-the-go convenience, shipping and storage efficiency, and other
reasons. Current processing of foods sometimes overcooks, cooks out the nutrients of the foods
and/or destroys the tastes of the food. Additionally, current heating processing of foods is
inefficient and requires a great amount of warehouse space and devices. Moreover, some people
won't eat food processed using current techniques because the taste of the food is degraded,
preservatives must be added or that the foods have lost their nutrient value.
                                             Summary
[0003] Embodiments of the present invention are directed to methods, products and systems for
processing food and/or other materials that may address the above issues. In accordance with
embodiments, a method for processing foods includes providing a food product that may be
equally suspended in a solution. The pre-processed food product (e.g., raw food) is processed by
rapidly heating the food product and continuously pumping the food solution through the system.
The processed food product is then delivered into a flexible package for consumption by a user.
[0004] According to one embodiment, a method for continuous processing food product includes
providing a food product and a solution. The food product is added to the solution so that the
food product is equally distributed in the solution, thereby forming a food solution. The food
solution is continuously pumped from a hopper or container through an electromagnetic or
volumetric source, which rapidly heats the food solution. The processed food solution may then
be filled in packages, such as flexible pouches.

[0005] In one embodiment, backpressure may be applied while the food solution is
pumped through the rapid heating process so that the food solution has a higher pressure
and thus, a higher boiling point.
[0006] In some embodiments, the pre-processed food product comprises food pieces or
particulates.  The pre-processed food product could be pieces or particulates of fruit,
vegetable, protein, meat, dairy-based, and/or any other consumable food.        The food
pieces or particulates could be in the form of a puree, a particulate, or a combination
thereof.

                                  Detailed Description
[0012] The present invention is described below with reference to flowchart illustrations
and/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and food products according to
embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart
illustrations and/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart
illustrations and/or block diagrams, can be implemented by elements of the system. The
blocks of the flow chart can be performed at any order and should not be limited to the
specific order described herein.
                                             2

[0013] Described herein is a method 100 and system 200 for processing food products or
other materials according to some embodiments to produce food products and/or food
solutions 300.
[0014] As mentioned above, a food product or solution is continuously processed using
volumetric heading and after processing is placed into one or more packages. The
process, according to some embodiments, is discussed in more depth in the methods of
Figures 1 and 3 and the systems of Figures 2 and 4. However, it should be understood
that the elements and steps presented in the Figures and discussed relative thereto should
not be so limited to any specific embodiment.           Instead, various modifications and
substitutions are also possible.
[0015] Referring first to Figure 1, Figure 1 is a flow chart of an example of a method
to process food or other materials in accordance with some embodiments of the
present invention. In block 101, a pre-processed food product is provided to a food
processing system 200. This pre-processed food product could be any fruits, vegetables,
and/or any consumable food product, or any combination thereof. For example, the food
product, as used herein, may be whole kernels of corn, whole green beans, whole peas,
mushrooms, carrots, and the like. In this regard, the food product may be raw and fresh
fruit and vegetables that have not be processed other than being harvested. The pre
processed food product may contain food piece that may be larger than 1/16" in cross
sectional diameter. In an embodiment, the pre-processed food product contains a mixture
of 1/8 -3/4" pieces of fruit, vegetable, protein, and/or dairy based and fruit, vegetable, etc.
In one embodiment, the pre-processed food product is %" pieces of vegetables, fruits,
and/or other food.
[0016] It is should be understood that the present invention need not be food and can also
be applicable to non-food products.
[0017] The food product may be placed in and therefore suspended in a liquid carrier
solution composed of fluids/materials, such as a water and thickener combination. The
thickener may be starch in one example and is referred to herein as starch, but it should
be known that starch, as referred to herein, may be any thickener. In one embodiment,
the liquid carrier solution may be between 0.5% to 2.5% starch to water solution. The
liquid carrier solution allows the food product, such as kernels of corn to be equally
                                                3

distributed in the solution.      As used herein the term "food solution" refers to a
combination of food product (e.g., kernels of corn) submerged in the liquid carrier
solution (e.g., water/starch solution or other solution).
[0018] It should be understood that the liquid carrier need not be limited to a water and
starch solution and other solutions may also be used. For example, the liquid carrier may
comprise gums, such as cellulose gum, CMC, Xanthan, or any other hydrocolloid or
protein. Other possible liquid carriers may also be used such as any solution which may
evenly space and/or suspend the food product therein.
[0019] The food is therefore converted into a pumpable state by adding one or more
liquid carriers to the food product. The introduction of liquid carriers allows at least
portions of the food product to reach a melting temperature or allows the food product to
travel along with a pumpable substance which will act as a lubricant when the food
product travels along or through a pipe (or other transfer system). The pumpable state of
the food solution allows the food product to be pumped into the pipes (or other transfer
means) of the system.
[0020] In block 104, the food solution is pumped (by a pump) from a food hopper into a
conduit or other transfer means to a heating conduit (or other device). The pump is
configured to pump the food solution from about 0.3-10 feet/second. This allows the
food solution to be continuously pumped through a heating system and continuously
filled into packages (as opposed to processing the food in separate batches).
[0021] In block 105, backpressure is applied to the food solution in the conduit (or other
device) so that the boiling point of the liquid carrier solution where backpressure is
applied is increased to a predetermined level. This allows the liquid carrier solution to be
increased to a higher level than normal so that a higher amount of heat can be absorbed
by the food product without the liquid carrier solution boiling.
[0022] In block 106, the pre-processed food solution is rapidly heated by volumetric
heating.    The volumetric heating increases the temperature of the pre-processed food
product to a pre-determined temperature rapidly. The temperature of the food product
during the repaid heating may be monitored to ensure that the pre-processed food product
reaches the pre-determined temperature (as determined by block 108). The pre-processed
food product may be heated to the pre-determined temperature in a short duration of time.
                                               4

In an embodiment, the time the pre-processed food product is exposed to the rapid
heating process may be less than about 1-4 minutes.
[0023] As mentioned above, the rapid heating process may use a volumetric heating
process via a rapid heating device which could be a device that delivers electromagnetic
energy (e.g., microwave energy, radio frequency energy, ohmic energy and/or other
forms of volumetric heating) to the pre-processed food solution (e.g., a microwave device
connected to a microwave generator so that microwave energy is focused into the pre
processed food solution from the microwave generator). The rapid heating system is
discussed in more depth later with regard to Figures 2 and 4.
[0024] The rapid heating phase (see Figure 4) may occur in a conduit extending from the
pump so that the food solution is directly pumped from the food solution hopper
continuously through the conduits of the rapid heating phase. The conduit may have one
or more passes (which may be serpentine or straight) such that multiple exposure areas of
volumetric heating occur (as illustrated in Figure 4). For example, there may be three
microwave generators which deliver microwave energy transversely to the conduit in the
rapid heating phase.
[0025]    The pre-processed food product may be heated in a relatively short duration of
time (e.g., less than or equal to 4 minutes). In an embodiment, the time the pre-processed
food solution is directly exposed to the rapid heating process so that the pre-processed
food product is heated to the pre-determined temperature may be less than or equal to
about 3 minutes or about 2 minutes. In another embodiment, the time is less than or
equal to 1 minute.
[0026]    As stated above, the pre-processed food solution is heated to a predetermined
temperature.    This predetermined temperature may be preset or predetermined by the
operator of the system such that the food product reaches such temperature and the
system does not substantially heat the food product above such predefined temperature.
According to one embodiment, this predetermined temperature generally relates to a
temperature that a regulatory agency requires for a food product so that the food product
is suitable for consumption. For example, the food solution (and/or food product) may be
heated to a temperature of 125-132 degrees Celsius.
                                              5

[0027]     According to another embodiment, the predetermined temperature relates to a
temperature that is somewhat greater than the temperature that a regulatory agency
requires for a food product so that the food product is fit for consumption.
[0028] For the pre-determined temperature, the food solution and thus, the food product,
exiting the rapid heating process would have minimal variation in temperature. In an
embodiment, the food solution exiting the rapid heating process would not vary more
than +/- 20*C. This maximum variation in temperature includes any point in the food
product, including the temperature at the center of any pieces of fruit, vegetable, protein,
dairy-based, and/or any consumable food in the food product.
[0029] Because the rapid heating process may use electromagnetic energy, the food
solution can be rapidly heated to the predetermined temperature and held at this
predetermined temperature for a relatively short period of time as compared with thermal
heating systems. As used herein, the term "critical zone" for processing fruits relates to
the temperature range where accelerated degradation occurs to the product quality and
nutrients.   For fruits, one should inactivate the native enzymes (which degrade the
anthocyanins and other phenolic antioxidants in the fruits) as soon as possible, and then
lower the food product's temperature out of their optimal activity temperature range
(which may be substantially the above-discussed predetermined temperature). Once a
fruit has been ground or sliced this degradation accelerates rapidly as the fruits' individual
cells rupture and thereby releasing enzymes contained in the fruit. The critical zone for
food may be between 104C and 100 0 C according to some embodiments; however, the
specific temperature is dependent on the time that the food is exposed to being heated as
well as the pH of the products to be processed.           Above a specific, predetermined
temperature (e.g., 70*C for some fruits, 93.3*C for other fruits, etc.), the process will
have killed the spoilage microorganisms and completely inactivated all product degrading
enzymes, but will continue degrading nutrients thermally until the product is cooled. One
should minimize the time above this temperature range as well to minimize thermal
degradation but less critical once the enzymes have been inactivated. Electromagnetic
devices used in the rapid heating process accomplish these goals due to the quick heating
of the food product as opposed to thermal heating systems.
                                              6

[0030]    As briefly mentioned above, the temperature of the food solution and/or food
product is monitored while being rapidly and volumetrically heated. Such monitoring
may be performed using one or more temperature sensors at each desired location of the
conduit. The monitored temperature at each location may be fed back into the system
228 and when the system determines that the food solution has reached the predefined
temperature, the heating system 210 stops substantially heating the food solution so that
the temperature of food solution does not continue to increase (or the food solution
temperature is held constant).
[0031] In block 108, a determination by system 228 may be made as to whether the food
product has reached the pre-determined temperature in the rapid heating process. The
temperature may be monitored to determine that the pre-determined temperature has been
reached as mentioned above. A control system is used to control the rapid heating
process that may integrate feedback from the monitored temperature. However, if the
system 228 determines that predefined temperature is not reached, the method 100
continues back to and repeats block 106.
[0032]    In block 110, the food solution exiting the rapid heating system may need to be
held at or near the exit temperature for a pre-determined length of time, where the exit
temperature being the temperature of the food product at the moment of exiting the rapid
heating system.    This occurs in the food solution temperature holding system. The
temperature holdingg system may be insulated pipes or other means for holding the food
solution temperature for a predetermined time. The amount of time that the food solution
temperature is kept constant is relatively short. In an embodiment, the time the pre
processed food solution is contained in the holding system may be less than about two
minutes. In another embodiment, the time in the holding system is less than one minute.
In some embodiments, the temperature being held in the food holding system would be
for aseptic processing.
[0033]    In block 118, if aseptic processing or aseptic packaging (e.g., packaging that has
been substantially sterilized to 5 log reduction or more) is desired, the food solution is
cooled in the food product cooling system. This food product cooling system may be a
heat exchanger such as a pipe in a cooling tube, shell in tube, and/or triple tube heat
exchangers. Transfer of thermal heat occurs from the food solution through the transfer
                                              7

 system to the cooling system so that the temperature of the food solution is more rapidly
cooled than if the cooling system was not present.         In one embodiment, the cooling
system includes a cooling tube surrounding the transfer system (or pipe) and the cooling
tube has cool water running therethrough to extract heat from the food solution in the
transfer system.
 [0034]   The cooling time may be relatively short.        In an embodiment, the time the
processed food solution is in the food product cooling system may be less than about 20
minutes. In an embodiment, the time in the food product cooling system is less than
about seven minutes.
 [0035]   In block 120, a determination is made whether the product is sufficiently cooled
for aseptic packaging. The temperature of the food solution may be monitored while the
food solution is being cooled in the cooling system to determine that the food solution is
sufficiently cooled for aseptic packaging. A control system may be used to manage,
monitor, and control the cooling process. In some embodiments, the food solution is
cooled to below 35*C prior to being transferred to the aseptic packaging.
[0036]    In block 122, the processed food solution is filled into a flexible package after
the desired cooling temperature of the food solution is reached. The flexible package
could have been sterilized using aseptic techniques during the processing of the food
solution. The package may be a single-serving flexible pouch, a large multiple serving
container, a mass-quantity packaging.
[0037] The food solution as discussed herein is processed and placed in a package. In one
embodiment, this package is aseptic so that it is substantially sterilized prior to adding the
food solution.
[0038] It should be understood that the packaging need not be aseptic. For example, the
package may be non-sterile, i.e., the packaging would have a sterility of less than one log
reduction and a pre-sterilization process (called ultra-clean process) would be used to
partially sterilize the packaging to a certain level, such as a three log reduction, two log
reduction or a one log reduction.
[0039] Regardless, the package could be flexible in that to obtain the contents of the
packaging, the packaging is squeezed to deform the sides of the packaging forcing the
contents of the interior of the packaging out of the packaging.       In an embodiment, the
                                              8

package is flexible and can contain less than 8 ounces of food product and greater than
one ounce of food product. In one embodiment, the package contains around 3.2 ounces
of food product. In some embodiments, the package can be squeezed to allow the food
product to be consumed.
[0040]    It should be understood that, in one embodiment, the heating of the food
solution is cooked in a process where the food solution is packaged after the food
solution is heated to a predefined temperature for a predetermined period of time to cook
the food and after the food has been cooled. In this regard, the food solution may not be
heated while in the packaging according to one embodiment.           According to another
embodiment, the food solution may be filled in the packaging prior to the rapid heating
phase and then heated and cooled to cook the food product.
[0041]    It should also be noted that the food solution is continuously processed. In one
embodiment, this may mean continuously pumping pieces of raw food through a conduit
from a large hopper to packages without interruption. As such, multiple batches of food
solution are all cooked through a single continuous process in a conduit and does nit need
to be separated until after heating and until the food solution is ready to be placed in a
package and consumed.
[0042]
[0043]    Figure 2 is a block schematic diagram of an exemplary system 200 of
continuous processing the food product to shelf stable or refrigerated food products in
accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. A food product 201 is
provided to the system 200.
[0044]    A food solution is created as discussed above. This may occur using a food
solution system 202 which creates a water and starch/thickener solution and mixes the
food product therein.
[0045]    The pre-processed food solution may be added to a receiving hopper 204 or any
other container.      The receiving hopper 204 holds the incoming pre-processed food
solution until it is pumped into the system and may hold several batches of food solution.
The receiving hopper 204 assures that the system has enough pre-processed food solution
to be pumped in the system so that there are minimal or no gaps in food solution provided
to the system during operation, according to some embodiments.
                                              9

[0046]    A pump system 206 is connected to the receiving hopper 204 and may be used
to convey the food solution throughout the system 200. The pump system 206 may
receive pre-processed food solution from the hopper and provide means for pumping the
food solution throughout the system 200. The pump system 206 may be interconnected
to a transfer system 208 allowing the pump system 206 to pump the food solution
through the transfer system 208.
[0047]    The transfer system 208 is used to interconnect the various systems, including
the pump system 206, for processing. The transfer system 208 may be a system of
interconnected pipes or conduits that connect one or more of the systems together, such
as the pump system 206, the receiving hopper 204, the heating and cooling systems 210,
214, the filling system 216, etc. The transfer system 208 may allow for the food solution
to easily transition from one of the various systems to another within the processing
system.    The transfer system 208 may be a system of pipes or conduits that are
substantially hollow but allow for a pumpable substance to be pumped therethrough.
[0048]    A rapid heating system 210 is thermally and/or electrically communicative with
the transfer system 208 and would increase the temperature of the pre-processed food
product in the transfer system 208 to a pre-determined temperature, whereas the pre
determined temperature is discussed above. The temperature of the food solution may be
monitored to ensure that the pre-processed food product reaches the pre-determined
temperature. A computer system 228 (which is discussed below) could be used to control
the temperature exiting the rapid heating system 210. The pre-processed food product
may be heated to the pre-determined temperature in a short duration of time, as
previously discussed.
[0049]    As stated above, at least a portion, or all, of the pre-processed food solution
enters the rapid heating system 210.      In some embodiments, the pre-processed food
solution enters the rapid heating system 210 in pumpable form, as discussed above. In
some embodiments, the pre-processed food may be pre-heated prior to entering the rapid
heating system 210, as stated above.
[0050]    The rapid heating system 210 may include at least one volumetric source 213.
Each volumetric source 213 may be a system that delivers electromagnetic energy to the
pre-processed food solution at one or more locations at the conduit from an
                                             10

electromagnetic energy generating source. For example, the volumetric source may be a
microwave generator (with a power of from about 50KW to 2MW) that generates and
transfers microwave energy into the pre-processed food product from the microwave
generator until the food solution or food product is heated to the above-discussed
predetermined temperature.      Alternatively, or additionally, the volumetric source 213
may be 1) a radio frequency ("RF') energy generator that delivers RF energy to the food
product until the food product or food product is heated to the above-discussed
predetermined temperature, 2) an ohmic energy generator that delivers ohmic energy to
the food product until the food product or food product is heated to the above-discussed
predetermined temperature, and/or 3) other forms of volumetric or electromagnetic
heating. The electromagnetic source delivers electromagnetic energy to the food solution
which allows for even and quick heating of the food product since the food product is
equally distributed throughout the solution (as opposed to thermal heating which requires
heating from the outside of the food product first and heating the inside of the food
product last). It should be understood that a volumetric source 213 need not be required
to be an electromagnetic source and could be any other source which rapidly heats the
food product in a predetermined time duration.
[0051]     The rapid heating system 210 also may include a temperature monitoring
computer/controls system 211 which manages the volumetric source 213 for delivering
electric (e.g., microwave, ohmic RF, etc.) energy to the food solution. For example, the
temperature monitoring computer/controls system 211 controls the volumetric source 213
to turn it on and off for delivering energy to the food solution in the transfer system 208.
Additionally, the temperature monitoring computer/controls system 211 monitors the
temperature of the food solution while it is being heated by the volumetric source 213.
When the food solution is heated to the predetermined temperature, the temperature
monitoring computer/controls system 211 turns the volumetric source 213 off (or
decreases the power thereof) so that the food product and/or food solution is not heated
above such predetermined temperature.
 [0052]    A temperature holding system 212 may be employed to hold the temperature of
the food solution at or near the exit temperature for a pre-determined length of time,
wherein such exit temperature is the temperature of the food solution at the moment of
                                              11

exiting the rapid heating system 210.        In one embodiment, according to the aseptic
processing, the temperature holding system 212 may be insulated pipes or a portion of the
transfer system 208 (which may be insulated, uninsulated, heated, cooled, etc.) to
maintain a certain predetermined temperature of the food product for a predetermined
time.
[0053]     The processed food solution may be cooled in a food product cooling system
214. The food product cooling system 214 may be a tube in a tube heat exchanger that is
connected with other tubes or pipes of the transfer system 208. Such tube may surround
a portion (e.g., a pipe) of the transfer system 208. The food product cooling system 214
may be used for the aseptic packaging process to cool the processed food product in the
transfer system 208, as previously discussed with regard to blocks 118-120.
[0054]     A filling system 216 is used to the transfer the food solution into the package
240. The filling system 216 may fill a pre-determined amount of food solution into the
package 240.       The package size may be virtually any size.       Possible sizes of the
packaging include but are not limited to 3 ounces, 8 ounces, 16 ounces, 1 liter, 2 liter, 5
liter, 55 gallon drums, 1 ton totes, tanker cars and other sizes. Additionally, the package
240 may be an aseptic (e.g., sterile) package or any other package.
[0055]     As mentioned above, the system 200 delivers the processed food solution into
the package 740 so that the processed food product is contained in the package 240. As
previously discussed the package 240 may contain the food solution which may be a
particulate food having processed raw food pieces (e.g., processed whole corn kernels,
processed whole green beans, and other processed whole vegetables and fruits), food
chunks and/or may have food puree. The package containing the food solution is sealed
for later use and for storing on a store shelf.
[0056]     A computer/controls system 228 may be used to manage or control any aspects
of the system 200. The computer/controls system 228 includes a processor and memory.
Input and output devices are also included in the computer/controls system 228, such as a
monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc.        The computer/controls system 228 includes various
modules, which includes computer code instructions to control the processor and
memory.     Any steps in methods 100 and 300 (Figure 3) may be performed by the
processor of the computer/controls system 228.       The module for rapid heating controls
                                               12

may control the rapid heating system 210. The module for filling the package manages
the filling of the package with processed food solution. The module for pumping food
solution through the transfer system controls the pump system 206 and other devices so
that the food solution (whether unprocessed or processed) through the transfer system
208 from the hopper 204, through the heating system 210, through the holding system
212 and all the way until filling the package 240. The module for cooling product
controls cooling the food solution after the food solution has been processed, such as by
actually providing cooling means and applying such cooling means while monitoring the
temperature of the food solution until the food solution is cooled. A module to make the
solution (e.g., water and starch/thickener mixture) for the food solution controls the
mixture of ingredients (e.g., water 215 and starch/thickener 216) to make the food
solution. Such module determines when the food solution is in a sufficient mixture so that
the food product that will be buoyantly suspended equally throughout the solution.
[0057]    Other modules may also be included in the computer/controls system 228 and
may work with any other device of the system 200.
[0058]    In some embodiments, the processed food solution may be able to be stored on
the shelf without refrigeration for six months or longer. In other embodiments, the
processed food solution may be stored under refrigeration conditions for three months or
longer.
[0059]    In some embodiments, the processed food solution may maintain some or a
majority of the nutrients of the pre-processed food solution.       These include but are
limited to antioxidants, anthocyanins, Vitamin C, Vitamin B, Vitamin A, beta-carotene,
bromelain, lycopene, and quercetin.
[0060] The processed food solution is contained in the package. The package containing
the food solution is sealed. In one embodiment, the sealed package contains less than
eight ounces and greater than one ounce of food solution. As such, both the solution and
food solution that were processed are both disposed in the package.
[0061] Figure 3 illustrates an example of a food product that is processed through the
system according to one embodiment. As previously discussed, the food product may be
fruits or vegetables. In Figure 3, the food product is whole kernels of corn. The corn
kernels are first cut from the cob and placed in a hopper (block 302). A solution is then
                                             13

created as previously discussed with a carrier solution (e.g., starch in water mixture) so
that the kernels of corn are suspended equally in the solution. The kernels of corn are
then added to the solution in block 304. As illustrated in Figure 5, the liquid carrier
solution 504 is illustrated in Figure 5 as equally distributing the food product 502
buoyantly in the solution 504. A container or hopper 506 holds the pre-processed food
solution.    It should be understood that only a few pieces of the food product are
illustrated, but it should be known that hundreds, thousands, or more pieces may be
equally distributed in the liquid carrier solution within the container or hopper.
[0062] At block 306, a pump continuously pumps the corn solution from the food hopper
to a conduit. Backpressure is applied to the conduit so that the corn solution has a higher
pressure (e.g., a pressure between 20 psig -70 psig) and thus a higher boiling point than if
the corn solution is exposed to ambient pressure. The backpressure is applied at the end
of the conduit towards the pump.
[0063] In block 308, the corn solution is in the conduit and while backpressure is applied,
three microwave generators deliver volumetric heating (e.g., RF heating, microwave
heating, Ohmic heating, etc.) at five points along the pressurized conduit so that the food
solution receives such volumetric heating. The food product is evenly distributed and
suspended in the solution and thus, the even microwave heating is equally distributed to
the corn. Both the corn and the solution is heated by the microwave generator. The corn
absorbs heat from the heated water/starch solution but also may receive microwave
energy from the source.        The microwave generators have waveguides which are
connected with the conduit to deliver the microwave energy from the microwave source
to the conduit. The waveguide of the microwave source may be split using a waveguide
split so as to deliver microwave energy to multiple locations on the conduit.
[0064] In block 309, the temperature of the corn kernels and/or corn solution is
monitored using temperature sensors. The temperature sensors may optically determine
the temperature of the corn solution. Additionally, a device may be inserted into the corn
solution to estimate the temperature of the food products suspended in the solution. A
computing device determines whether the corn kernels or corn solution has reached a
predefined temperature. If not, the method 300 returns back to 308; otherwise, method
300 may proceed to block 311.
                                               14

[0065] In block 311, the temperature of the corn solution is held at a predefined
temperature using an insulated pipe. This is done after the rapid heating process but
before packaging of the processed corn solution.
[0066] In block 318, the corn solution is cooled as previously described. Once it is
determined that the corn solution has cooled to a desired temperature (block 320), the
corn solution is then filled into the individual aseptic packages (322).
[0067] It should be understood that the processes of 302-322 happen continuously and
without interruption so that whatever amount of food product is placed in the hopper, this
food is then pumped out and heated continuously until the hopper is emptied.
[0068] Figure 4 is a block schematic diagram of an exemplary system of continuous
processing of food products using volumetric heating in accordance with some
embodiments of the present invention. As illustrated the product and solution is added to
the food hopper. The food solution is illustrated by the shading the Figure 4. The food
solution enters a pump which pumps the food solution through the rapid heating phase.
During such rapid heating phase, the food solution is exposed to multiple points of
volumetric heating and the temperature is measured at several locations along the
conduit. It should be noted that any electromagnetic energy that is not absorbed by the
food solution may go into a water load or be routed back to the conduit (either by a
conductive termination plate or back to another location on the conduit). Regardless,
while the food solution is being heated, a backpressure device is illustrated as applying
pressure back to the pump.        Then, the food solution enters the temperature holding
conduit and thereafter the cooling system.         After the food solution is cooled, it is
packaged using a packaging system. Figure 4 illustrates the packaging occurring on a
conveyer belt so that the packaging system can continuously fill the packages on in an
assembly-line fashion as illustrated. The filled packages are then sealed and then may be
consumed or placed on a store shelf.
[0069] It should be noted that any of the elements of the methods may be applicable to
any other elements of any of the other methods. And as such, the blocks and related
description apply to any elements.
