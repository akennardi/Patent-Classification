                                       TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002] This disclosure relates to valves. More specifically, this disclosure relates to
position indicators for valves.
                                         BACKGROUND
[0003] Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles and the like in this
specification is included solely for the purpose of providing a context for the present
invention. It is not suggested or represented that any of these matters formed part of the
prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present
invention as it existed in Australia or elsewhere before the priority date of each claim of this
application.
[0004] Non-rising stem gate valves, butterfly valves, ball valves and similar types of valves
may be operated by a number of different processes, including manual and electronic
actuation. For example, non-rising stem gate valves provide a means to isolate and to stop
flow in a piping system by rotating an internal threaded stem that moves the gate into proper
alignment, i.e. to an open or closed position. Likewise, a butterfly valve rotates an internal
disk that allows or prevents the flow of water through the valve. However, it can be difficult
to determine whether a non-rising stem gate valve, a butterfly valve or similarly constructed
valves are open or closed simply by viewing it from the outside.

                                                 5
                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0047] Disclosed are methods, systems, devices, and various apparatus related to position
indicators for various valves. Although this disclosure is presented mainly in the context of a
non-rising stem gate valve interacting with water, the methods, systems, devices, and
various apparatus disclosed herein may be used with any type of valve and any type of
material where determining the status of the valve is difficult. The position indicator includes
at least one monitoring element and at least one communication element. The position
indicator is adapted to monitor, detect and communicate (locally or remotely) the status of
the valve. It would be understood by one of skill in the art that the disclosed position
indicator is described in but a few exemplary embodiments among many. No particular
terminology or description should be considered limiting on the disclosure or the scope of
any claims issuing therefrom.
[0048] In municipal piping systems, non-rising stem gate valves selectively prevent or
allow flow of fluid through particular portions of the systems. As illustrated in FIG. 1, a
typical non-rising stem gate valve 10 includes a housing 15, a bonnet 20, and an op nut 25.
The op nut 25 is coupled to a stem 30. A stuffing box 35 is connected to the top of the
bonnet 20. Bolts 37a,b,c and nuts 38a,b,c fasten the bonnet 20 onto the housing 15. Bolts
37d,e and nuts 38d,e connect the stuffing box 35 to the bonnet 20.
[0049] As illustrated in cross-sectional view in FIG. 2, the stem 30 includes threading 39 to
engage a gate 40 and to cause the gate 40 to rise out of or to descend into the path of the
fluid flowing in the housing 15. The stem 30 is a non-rising stem, meaning it is not coupled
to the housing 15 or the bonnet 20 in a way that would cause it to rise or fall with the motion
of the gate 40. Although motion of the stem 30 may be restricted by the housing 15 or the
bonnet 20, the threading 39 of the stem 30 is not mechanically connected to the housing 15
or the bonnet 20, so the stem 30 does not move upward or downward with the gate 40.
Instead, the threads 39 of the stem 30 interact with threads (not shown) in the gate 40 to
cause translational motion of the gate 40 from an open state (not shown)-in which fluid is
allowed to flow through the gate valve 10- to a closed state (shown in FIG. 2)-in which
fluid is blocked from flowing through the gate valve 10-and vice versa.
[0050] From the outside, however, it is difficult to determine whether the valve 10 is in the
open state or the closed state or somewhere between. This can also cause problems from a
systems perspective if the valve is connected to an electronic nodal network or utility mesh
network, and the network is unable to determine the state of the valve 10.

                                               6
[0051] The current disclosure includes methods, systems, and apparatus capable of
determining a state of a non-rising stem gate valve and may include communication with a
remote communicator. Various embodiments disclosed herein are exemplary embodiments
meant to satisfy applicable statutory requirements. The embodiments disclosed herein
should not be considered limiting on the disclosure.
[0052] As illustrated in FIGs. 3 and 4, one embodiment of a position indicator 100 and a
non-rising stem gate valve 1000 is disclosed herein. The non-rising stem gate valve 1000
includes the same op nut 25, bonnet 20, stuffing box 35, housing 15, and gate 40 (not
shown in FIGs. 3 and 4) as the non-rising stem gate valve 10 as previously described.
However, the non-rising stem gate valve 1000 includes the position indicator 100 as an
additional component. Although some components are coincident between the non-rising
stem gate valve 1000 in the current embodiment and the non-rising stem gate valve 10 as
previously described, the use of such components is for convenience only and is merely
exemplary, and one of skill in the art would understand that no specific configuration or
components will limit the scope of the disclosure.
[0053] The position indicator 100 is connected to the gate valve 1000 and monitors the
motion of the stem. A magnet 110 (shown in FIGs. 5A and 5B) is connected to a position
couple 120 that is coupled to a stem 130. In the current embodiment, the position couple
120 is a threaded collar. In the current embodiment, the magnet 110 is embedded within the
position couple 120. In various embodiments, one or more magnets 110 may be placed
within or on the position couple 120 in various arrangements. In other embodiments the
position couple 120 may include magnetic material in its construction and thereby perform
as a magnet, removing the need of a separate magnet 110. In some embodiments, the
position couple 120 is coupled to the gate 40 or rests on the gate 40 to track the motion of
the gate 40 directly. In some embodiments, the position indicator 100 may include at least
one proximity sensor to determine proximity (relative to the proximity sensor) of the position
couple 120 and magnet 110 and, thereby, the gate 40 that indicates their positions within
the gate valve 1000. The magnet 110 follows the travel of the position couple 120 and,
thereby, the movement of the stem 130 and gate 40. Particularly, in the current
embodiment, the position couple 120 includes fine threads 135 which interact with fine
threads 140 of the stem 130. Rotational movement of the stem 130 causes the translational
movement of the gate 40 and the position couple 120 and, thereby, the magnet 110. The
translational movement of the gate 40 corresponds to translational motion of the magnet

                                                  7
110, although the correspondence is dependent upon the pitch of the fine threads 140 with
respect to the pitch of the magnet threads 39 (not shown in FIG. 3)
[0054] As illustrated in FIG. 3, the stem 130 of the current embodiment includes fine
threads 140 that interact with the position couple 120. The position couple 120 of the current
embodiment screws onto the stem 130 in proximity to a circuit board 150 that includes at
least one proximity sensor which, in the current embodiment is two Hall sensors 155a,b. The
circuit board 150 of the current embodiment may be replaced by similar mechanisms or
materials for supporting or providing circuitry and other electrical components and
connections. The circuit board 150 is positioned in an electronic case enclosure 160. The
Hall sensors 155a,b can be seen on a side of the circuit board 150 proximate the position
couple 120 and magnet 110 in the current embodiment, although various configurations may
be used in various embodiments. In various embodiments, various sensor types may be
used. One of skill in the art would understand that the proximity sensing of the current
embodiment-utilizing Hall sensors 155a,b and the magnet 110-may be replaced by
various proximity sensing techniques, including light sensing, audible sensing or SONAR,
fluid viscosity, pressure devices, springs, rotational motion sensing, linear variable
differential transformers ("LVDT"), various methods incorporating the above concepts with
software, or various other methods. The electronic case enclosure 160 of the current
embodiment includes a bottom 162 and a top 164. The top 164 is attached to the bottom
162 with mounting bolts 166a,b,c,d, although various fasteners may be used in various
embodiments. The position indicator 100 assembly of the current embodiment is shown
along with the stuffing box 35, which is the standard stuffing box 35 as previously shown. As
seen in FIG. 4, the electronic case enclosure can be seen proximate the top end of the non
rising stem gate valve 1000, but the gate valve 1000 otherwise appears visually similar to
the traditional non-rising stem gate valve such as non-rising stem gate valve 10, as shown
above.
[0055] Turning to FIGs. 5A and 5B, the magnet 110 of the current embodiment is in
proximity to the circuit board 150. The circuit board 150 has at least one Hall sensor
included as part of its circuitry. In the current embodiment, Hall sensors 155a,b are shown.
The Hall sensors 155a,b monitor the position of the magnet 110. In the current embodiment,
the position of the magnet 110 can be determined reliably when the magnet is within one
inch of each Hall sensors 155a,b. However, in various embodiments, the size of the magnet
and the sensitivity of the supporting circuitry may allow a wider distance. Additionally, in
various embodiments, one or multiple Hall sensors like Hall sensors 155a,b may be used to

                                                 8
provide redundant or combination sensing. The circuit board 150 may include more than one
Hall sensor 155 or may include various types of position sensors, including light sensors
(e.g. light sources and sensors are strategically placed within the valve), mechanical
position sensors (illustrated in FIGs. 6 and 7), and audio sensors (e.g. audio sources emit
an audible or non-audible signal and audio sensors, such as hydrophones, microphones and
the like, listen and determine the position of the gate by sound, frequency and/or time),
among others. Moreover, the position indicator 100 may communicate the position to a
variety of other devices or to a human. The use of the Hall effect and Hall effect sensors are
well known in the art for use as proximity detectors. Additionally information may be
obtained at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halleffectsensor, which is incorporated herein by
reference.
[0056] Returning to FIG. 4, the non-rising stem gate valve 1000 may include one or more
communication elements, including visual indicators, audible indicators, and/or
communication devices. Examples of visual indicators include single or multiple lighted
devices, LEDs, LCDs, dot matrix screens, or possibly cell phones or other similar
communication devices as visual indicators. Audible indicators may include speakers and
other audio devices. A communication device (further discussed in reference to FIGs. 12
and 13) such as a handheld position display, a cellular communication box, or a radio
communication module, radio transceiver and transmitter, satellite transceiver and
transmitter, cellular transceiver and transmitter, which may communicate via a wireless
network , Bluetooth protocol, infra-red communication, or direct wired communication may
also be incorporated in various embodiments of the gate valve 1000 or the position indicator
100. In various embodiments, the communication device or devices may interface with
computers, the internet, other computer networking devices, or other electronic devices and
software such as PDAs, smartphones, tablet computers, apps and computer applications,
and networking software, among others.
[0057] The communication device may indicate, transmit, and/or interpret the position of
the magnet 110 and, thereby, the state of the gate valve 1000. The communication device
may be an integral part of the position indicator 1000 in various embodiments. For other
examples, the position indicator 100 is separate from the communication device and
connected either wirelessly or by wire. Power to the position indicator 100 and
communication device may be provided by (to either or both devices) by battery, wire line,
solar, generators, wind energy, hydro-electrical, thermo-electrical or another power source.
The non-rising stem gate valve 1000 may also include a remote actuation device to provide

                                                9
remote control of the non-rising stem gate valve 1000 to remotely change it from an open
state to a closed state (and vice versa) or some state in between. Such remote actuation
may include AC motor driven, DC motor driven, or using a compressed air or hydraulic
charge system, among other embodiments.
[0058] The position indicator 100 can be incorporated into the non-rising stem gate valve
1000 in various ways. In one embodiment, the position indicator 100 is an integral part of
the non-rising stem gate valve 1000; in another embodiment, the position indicator 100 is an
attachable/detachable assembly or part.
[0059] Optional sensors or other electrical hardware may be interfaced with the position
indicator 100 to function in many capacities. Security features, pressure sensors and
switches, temperature sensors, emergency shut-offs, flow velocity sensors, and chemical
sensors, among other hardware, may each interface with the position indicator 100, the non
rising stem gate valve 1000, and/or any communication device included therewith.
Moreover, the position indicator 100 and/or the non-rising stem gate valve 1000 may act as
a repeater for wireless communications if needed in a network.
[0060] One of skill in the art would understand that other similar methods of tracking
motion of the stem and/or the gate are included within this disclosure. For example, among
other embodiments, the position indicator 100 could track rotational motion of the stem and
use the rotational travel of the stem to calculate, based on thread size and pitch of the stem,
the travel of the gate.
[0061] Another embodiment of a position indicator 500 is shown in a non-rising stem gate
valve 5000 in FIGs. 6 and 7. The position indicator 500 of the current embodiment does not
include magnets or Hall sensors as previously described. The position indicator 500 of the
current embodiment utilizes measurement of the mechanical rotation of the stem 30 to
determine the translational movement of the gate 40.
[0062] The position indicator 500, illustrated in FIG. 6, of the current embodiment includes
a gear box to capture rotational movement. The stem 30 of the current embodiment is the
same stem 30 utilized in the traditional non-rising stem gate valve 10 and is unmodified for
the current embodiment. The position indicator 500 includes a gear enclosure 510 that
includes a bottom 512 and a top 514. The top 514 of the gear enclosure 510 is connected to
the bottom 512 of the gear enclosure using screws 518a,b,c,d,e,f,g,although various
embodiments may include various fasteners and fastening methods.
[0063] An o-ring 520 is included and fitted around the stem 30 to connect the stem 30 to a
ring gear 530. The o-ring 520 is placed between the ring gear 530 and the stem 30 to

                                               10
provide friction between the ring gear 530 and the stem 30 so that the ring gear 530 can be
mechanically coupled to the stem 30 without modifying the stem 30. However, other
mechanical connections may be utilized in various embodiments.
[0064] The ring gear 530 is arranged in engagement with an intermediate gear 540. The
intermediate gears 540 is arranged to rotate around an intermediate gear shaft 545 that is
connected to the gear enclosure 510. The intermediate gear 540 provides a mechanical
correlation between rotation of the ring gear 530 and rotation of a potentiometer gear 550
that is arranged in engagement with the intermediate gear 540. The potentiometer gear 550
is fixedly connected to a potentiometer shaft 560 of a potentiometer 570. As such, the
position indicator 500 provides a mechanical correlation between rotation of the stem 30 and
rotation of the potentiometer shaft 560. The output resistance of the potentiometer 570
varies with the rotation of the potentiometer shaft 560. This variation can be correlated to
the position of the gate in the non-rising stem valve. The rotation of the stem 30 can be
calculated based on the gear ratio of the potentiometer shaft 560, the intermediate gear
550, the ring gear 540, and the stem 30. Vertical movement of the gate 40 can be
determined from rotation of the stem 30 by a calculation involving pitch of the threads 39 of
the stem 30. As such, the position indicator 500 of the current embodiment may provide a
mechanical means of measuring rotation of the stem 30 from which the travel of the gate 40
can be determined. Although the FIG. 6 does not explicitly show teeth, the ring gear 530,
intermediate gear 540, and potentiometer gear 550 include an interface between each other
that may include teeth, frictional surfaces, magnetic pole interaction, or another system to
allow motion of the stem 30 to correspond with motion of the potentiometer shaft 560.
[0065]    In various embodiments, other mechanical systems may provide similar value to the
system described above. For example, in some systems, a DC motor, stepper motor, and/or
various encoders, such as encoders that count the number of turns of the stem, may be
implemented in an embodiment similar to the embodiment of FIG. 6. One of skill in the art
would understand that various modifications to the embodiments of the current disclosure do
not depart from general teachings of the disclosure, and various accommodations must be
made to permit variance amongst the various embodiments.
[0066]    FIG. 7 shows a non-rising stem gate valve 5000 of the current embodiment. The
position indicator 500 of the current embodiment can be seen on the gate valve 5000.
[0067]    In some embodiments of each position indicator 100,500 (and position indicator
600, shown below with reference to FIGs. 9-11D), the position indicator 100,500,600 may
be attached to a valve such as non-rising stem gate valve 10 through retrofitting. Some

                                                 11
existing valves are buried several feet underground, so retrofitting may be accomplished in
some embodiments via a long arm to remove and replace various elements of a valve with
new elements integrated with any of position indicators 100,500,600. Retrofitting existing
valves would not require new gears, actuators, or other components in some embodiments,
and the existing valves would continue to operate normally. In some embodiments of each
position indicator 100,500,600, the position indicator 100,500,600 may be provided with the
valves such as non-rising stem gate valves 1000,5000 (and gate valves 6000, shown below
with reference to FIGs. 9-11 D) respectively, in a preassembled package. Various other
embodiments are considered within the disclosure as well, including, among others,
integrating the position indicator with the stuffing box 35, installing along the stem 30 by
removing the op nut 25, and providing a separate package that connects onto the bonnet 20
or the housing 15.
[0068] Other exemplary embodiments of a monitoring method and apparatus of the current
disclosure include an optical sensor or an infrared sensor. In this embodiment, a light
source, e.g. one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs), may be placed on the housing 15 on
one side of the gate 40 and a light detecting sensor may be placed on the opposite side of
the housing 15 and gate 40 inside the housing 15. Such a system would allow detection of
opening or closing of the gate 40 and any valve into which such system was incorporated by
detecting whether light is passing from one side of the gate 40 to the other. For example,
one embodiment of the current disclosure may include three sets of LEDs and
corresponding light detecting sensors, each set of LEDs and sensors may be spaced, on a
vertical axis, equally throughout non-rising stem gate valve housing 15 (i.e. top, middle,
bottom). As the gate 40 travels from an open to a closed position, the gate 40 will pass and
block the light as it travels. Depending on the light blocked, the position indicator may
translate such blockage into position or status of gate 40. In some embodiments, light
sensing could be provided by light intensity to determine the percentage of gate opening.
[0069]    Another exemplary embodiment includes an audio source and an audio sensor in a
valve. The audio source may produce an audible or non-audible signal (i.e. a "ping") and the
audio sensor (e.g. a hydrophone, an accelerometer, or microphone) listens and determines
the characteristics of the ping by sound, frequency, time, amplitude, phase shifting, and
other characteristics that correlates into the position or state of the valve. Such an
embodiment would operate in a nature similar to SONAR.
[0070] Another exemplary embodiment includes toggle switching to indicate whether a
gate valve is open or closed. A toggling embodiment can take multiple forms, including

                                                 12
those described elsewhere in this disclosure when reconfigured to provide open/closed
indication rather than percentage indication. In other embodiments, the position indicator
may include an electrical contact on the end of the gate 40 and on the inside of the housing
15 such that a short is made when the gate 40 is closed and contacts the inside of the
housing 15 and an open is formed when the gate 40 is raised. In other embodiments,
mechanical switching in contact with the gate 40 or other components of the system may
provide benefit in creating an open/closed indication.
[0071] An exemplary embodiment of a monitoring circuit of the current disclosure is
illustrated in FIG. 8. The monitoring circuit 800 may be present on circuit board 150 of the
current embodiment. The monitoring circuit 800 includes a microprocessor 850, a first Hall
sensor 810, a second Hall sensor 820, a voltage source 830, multiple connectors 840 and
various other components (e.g. capacitors, resistors and diodes), which components are
ancillary to the design of the monitoring circuit 800 and use of such components are well
known in the art. In the current embodiment, circuit board 150 may be placed in a vertical
orientation so that Hall sensor 810 is directly below Hall sensor 820 on a vertical axis. In a
closed state, gate 40 and magnet 110 are closer in proximity to Hall sensor 810, and
magnet 110 produces a stronger magnetic field sensed by Hall sensor 810 relative to the
magnetic field sensed by Hall sensor 820. Hall sensor 810 produces and transmits a signal
to microprocessor 850 indicating the presence of a strong magnetic field. Microprocessor
850 interprets this signal and correlates the signal to the position of gate 40. Because the
location of the gate 40 and magnet 110 is farther from the Hall sensor 820, Hall sensor 820
provides microprocessor 850 with a signal indicating little or no magnetic field. The signal
from Hall sensor 820 confirms the location of the gate 40. Conversely, if the gate 40 and
magnet 110 are in an open position and close in proximity to Hall sensor 820, the
microprocessor 850 will interpret the signals from Hall sensors 810, 820 as the non-rising
stem gate valve 1000 being open. Similarly, if gate 40 and magnet 110 are in an
intermediate state or position, i.e. not fully open or closed, the Hall sensors 810, 820 will
produce signals indicating such state/position.
[0072] Microprocessor 850 may also receive signals from other internal and external
devices with which it may be interfacing via connectors 840. Connectors 840 may provide
connection to or communication with various other sensors, displays, diagnostic tools,
communication devices, and the like. The monitoring circuit 800 may communicate via
analog or digital methods, wirelessly or wired, to any of various devices, which may be
mounted with the non-rising stem gate valve 1000 or in another location desired. Although

                                                   13
the current embodiment includes microprocessor 850, microprocessor 850 is not necessary,
and its function may be implemented in hardware.
[0073] Although the exemplary embodiment of the monitoring circuit described with relation
to FIG. 8 includes Hall sensors 810,820, one of skill in art would understand that various
embodiments may require modification from the embodiment shown. For example, replacing
the Hall sensors 810,820 with a potentiometer (such as shown with the embodiment of FIG.
6), related biasing circuitry and related software in the microprocessor would enable one of
skill in the art to alter the circuitry as shown for other embodiments disclosed herein.
[0074] Another embodiment of a position indicator 600 and gate valve 6000 is seen in
FIGs. 9-11 D. FIGs. 9-10 display an exploded view of the gate valve 6000 and a close-up
exploded view of the position indicator 600 in assembly with other features of the gate valve
6000. The gate valve 6000 includes a stem 610, the position indicator 600, the stuffing box
35, bolts 75a,b, nuts 76a,b, the bonnet 20, the housing 15, the op nut 25, and an op nut bolt
619. FIG. 10 displays a close-up view of the gate valve 6000 of FIG. 9. As seen, the position
indicator 600 has two keys 630a,630b (630b seen in FIGs. 11A- 1C) which each accept
one of the bolts 75a,b to keep the position indicator 600 aligned without rotating. The stem
610 includes o-ring channels 642,644,646 that accept o-rings (not shown) to provide friction
for the position indicator 600 to be slipped over the stem 610 as will be discussed later. A
connection post 695 is seen for connection of a wire if necessary. The position indicator 600
includes a stem aperture 679.
[0075] FIG. 11A displays an exploded view of the position indicator 600. The position
indicator 600 includes a stem collar 645 that includes threading 647 on an outer surface.
The stem collar 645 is fit over the stem 610 with o-rings (not shown) along its inner surface
649 so that the stem collar 645, having friction with the stem 610, engages the stem 610
and rotates therewith. A circuit board 650 is seen and is similar to circuit board 150 as
previously described. A position couple 620 is seen that includes threading 622 on an inner
surface. A case enclosure 670 includes a bottom 672 and a top 674. A magnet 675 is seen.
The magnet 675 is placed inside or connected to the position couple 620. A positioning clip
680 is seen proximate a lower end of the position indicator 600. The position clip 680
includes keys 630a,b to engage the bolts 75a,b of the gate valve 600. The connection post
695 is also seen.
[0076] FIG. 11 B displays a top view of the position indicator 600. As can be seen, the
position indicator 600 includes two keys 630a,630b to accept the bolts 75a,b. FIG 11C
shows a cross-sectional view of the position indicator 600. The position couple 620 is seen

                                                  14
with its threading 622 engaging the threading 647 on the stem collar 645. FIG. 11 D shows
another cross-sectional view of the position indicator 600. The magnet 675 can be seen
inside the position couple 620. The circuit board 650 includes Hall sensors 655a,b. In
connection with the stem, the stem collar 645 is attached to the stem 610 using o-rings (not
shown) that provide friction with the stem 610. The connection post 695 is seen as well.
[0077] In operation, the stem 610 is coupled to the stem collar 645 via o-rings (not shown)
so that the stem collar 645 rotates with the stem 610. Threading 647 of the stem collar 645
engages threading 622 of the position couple 620 to cause the position couple 620 to move
vertically with the rotation of the stem 610. As discussed elsewhere in this disclosure,
vertical motion of the position couple 620 corresponds with vertical motion of the magnet
675, which is sensed by Hall sensors 655a,b.
[0078] As seen with reference to FIGs. 12 and 13, the position indicator 100,500,600 may
be connected to a communication device. With reference to FIG. 12, communication device
1210 provides a visual readout of the state of the non-rising stem gate valve
1000,5000,6000. A wire conductor 1205 is connected on one end to the position indicator
100,500,600 via one of the connectors 840 (see FIG. 8) and on the other end to the
communication device 1210 via connector 1230. The communication device 1210 has a
screen 1220 that provides a readable display. The communication device 1210 may include
circuitry or other electronics to interpret the signals it receives from the position indicator
100, 500. In other embodiments, the screen 1220 may display information provided by
microprocessor 850 (see FIG. 8), Although a wire conductor 1205 is included in the current
embodiment, the communication device 1210 may be connected wirelessly to the position
indicator 100, 500.
[0079] With reference to FIG. 13, communication device 1310 is connected to the position
indicator 100,500,600 by a wire conductor 1205 via connector 1330. The communication
device 1310 includes an antenna 1350. In the current embodiment, the antenna 1350 may
be mounted above ground level or just below ground level. In various embodiments, various
antennas may be used that may be mounted in various spatial relationships with the ground
and/or with the position indicator 100,500,600. Various embodiments may or may not
include antennas that protrude from the communication device 1310. Although the
communication device 1310 does not include a readable display such as the screen 1220 of
the communication device 1210, in various embodiments, various communication devices
may include both screens and wireless communication capability. Communication device
1310 may communicate the data and information received from position indicator 100, 500

                                              15
to local or remote devices via one or more ways including cellular, Bluetooth, and WIFI
communication methods.
[0080] As seen in FIG. 14, a system 1400 of the current disclosure as applied to a
residential water supply may include various components. Non-rising stem gate valves
1000,5000,6000 may be connected in the system 1400 along with various valves such as
check valve 1410 and butterfly valve 1420. The system 1400 may include a fire hydrant
1430. The various components of the system 1400 may include their own position indicators
that may be similar in components or features to position indicators 100,500. The
components of the system 1400 may be connected together and in communication with the
communication device 1310 (as shown) or with another device such as communication
device 1210 (not shown) via a wired connection or through wireless communication. The
communication device 1310, via antenna 1350 may be capable of communicating with a
remotely located communicator 1440. The system 1400 may also be capable of interfacing
with another system along a nodal network or through a monitoring device 1450 such as a
PC, cellular, Bluetooth, or HTML web enabled device, among others.
[0081] Another exemplary embodiment of a system embodying the current disclosure is
system 1500 shown in FIG. 15. Various non-rising stem gate valves 1000,5000,6000 are
connected in communication with each other as shown. Additionally, the system 1500
includes a non-rising stem gate valve 1000',5000', which includes a DC actuator (as
discussed previously) and a non-rising stem gate valve 1000",5000", which includes an AC
actuator (as discussed previously). Additional valves such as non-rising stem gate valves
1000,1000',1000",5000,5000',5000" may be connected or "daisy-chained" in the system
1500. A power source 1520 is shown as a 120V or 220V alternating current (AC) source to
power the AC actuator of the non-rising stem gate valve 1000",5000". Another power
source 1530 is shown as a direct current (DC) battery to power the DC actuator of the non
rising stem gate valve 1000',5000'. No single power source or power supply method should
be considered limiting on the disclosure, and various power arrangements may be made for
various components of the system 1500 or similar systems in accord with the current
disclosure.
[0082] The DC power source 1530 in the current embodiment may be charged through
solar energy of solar panels 1540. Other sources of power such as wind, water, heat,
vibration, compressed air, and spring energy, among others, may be used in various
embodiments and would be understood by one of skill in the art.

                                                16
[0083] The "daisy-chain" of non-rising stem gate valves
1000,1000',1000",5000,5000',5000"are connected to the communication devices
1210,1310. In the current embodiment, the communication devices 1210,1310, includes the
antenna 1350, and communicate with a remotely located communicator (not shown). Power
to the communication devices 1210, 1310 is supplied by the power source 1560, which may
be AC or DC power and may be supplied by wire, solar, battery, or other method. Solar
panels 1570 are shown connected to the power source 1560 and may be included to
provide power.
[0084] Illustrated in FIG. 16, system 1600 may include various combinations of
components, processes, methods and apparatus. The combinations of components,
processes, methods and apparatus as described with reference to FIG. 16 may be
implemented in the systems 1400,1500 previously described or in various other
implementations of the current disclosure. Position monitoring and indicating as shown in
block 1610 may include magnetic, mechanical, potentiometer (such as potentiometer 570
included with position indicator 500), switches in series, or magnetic field (such as the
magnetic field described in connection with position indicator 100) sensing, among others.
Some magnetic or mechanical methods may display only an open or a closed state and may
not provide exact position location; other approaches to position indicating (such as those
previously described) may provide approximate position indication based on sensed or
percentage data. The power source as shown by block 1620 may include a number of
options including 120V or 220V AC power, solar, battery, wireless power wand, hand crank
or other mechanical storing of potential energy, or through a connection of another power
source. Communication methods as shown by block 1630 may include cellular, radio,
ethernet, Bluetooth, satellite, or connection to another communication device. Field
applications shown by block 1640 may include electronic and remote actuation; position
indication; data gathering such as water pressure, temperature, turbidity, velocity, and other
features of the system 1600; maintenance applications such as routine or emergency
flushing; and, security applications such as tamper detection or hazardous material flushing.
[0085] Other components of the system 1500 may include various valves, meters, and
hydrants, among others. Although the current embodiment is discussed in the context of
non-rising gate valves 1000,1000',1000",5000,5000',5000",6000,6000',6000",one of skill in
the art would understand that multiple components of the system 1500 may include various
position indicators and may be connected in the system.
