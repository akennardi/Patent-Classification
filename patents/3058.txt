BAKED COMPOSITION
Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to a baked foodstuff with an improved flavour and an improved
texture. Also to compositions for generating these improved flavours and textures in baked
foodstuffs which compositions comprise non pre-reacted flavour precursors which react on
heating to generate the flavours. In particular, the present invention relates to baked
components of confectionery with improved biscuit, buttery, fruity, nutty, caramel, golden
syrup, honey, toasted, roasted bread-like and baked flavours.
2. Background to the Invention
The term "Maillard reaction" and "Maillard reactants/products" are terms of art which define
the complex series of chemical reactions between carbonyl and amino components derived
from biological systems and the associated reactants and products, respectively. The term
Maillard reaction is used herein in the established broad sense to refer to these reactions, and
includes the closely associated reactions which are usually coupled with the Maillard reaction
sensu stricto (such as Strecker degradation).
In foods, the Maillard reaction results in both the production of flavours and browning (see
Bailey, M.E. (1994) Maillard reactions and meat flavour development, pages 153-173, In:
Flavour of meat and meat products, Ed. F. Shahidi, Academic Press; Ames, J. M. (1992) The
Maillard Reaction, pages 99-143, In: Biochemistry of Food Proteins, Ed. B. J. F. Hudson,
Elsevier App. Sci. London).
With respect to flavour generation, the Maillard reaction can be broken down into four stages.
The first stage involves the formation of glycosylamines. The second stage involves
rearrangement of the glycosylamines to form Amadori and Heyns rearrangement products
(often abbreviated in the literature to "ARPs" and "HRPs", respectively). The third stage
involves dehydration and or fission of the Amadori and Heyns rearrangement products to
furan derivatives, reductones and other carbonyl compounds (which may have significant
organoleptic qualities). (These "third stage products" may also be produced without the
formation of ARP's or HRP's. The fourth stage involves the conversion of these furan
derivatives, reductones and other carbonyl compounds into coloured and aroma/flavour
compounds. Thus, products and reactants present in both the third and fourth stage of the
Maillard reaction contribute towards aroma and or flavour.

Thus, the terms "Maillard reaction", "Amadori rearrangement product", "Heyns
rearrangement product", "aroma compound" and "flavour compound", unless indicated
otherwise, are used herein in the above-described senses.
Maillard reactions occur naturally in food, but it is also known to use Maillard reaction
products to improve the flavour of foodstuffs.
Caramel and biscuit flavour generation has been described in many model reaction systems.
4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3 (2H)-furanone (corresponding to FuraneolTM a registered
trademark of Firmenich Inc.) is one compound associated with caramel flavour. 4-hydroxy
2,5-dimethyl-3 (2H)-furanone can be produced in high levels from 6-deoxy-hexoses such as
rhamnose (6deoxy-L-mannose), fucose (6-deoxy-L-galactose) and 6-deoxy-fructose by
reaction with an amine (Wong et al. 1983, J Org Chem 48: 3493-3497; Whitehead 1998, Food
Technology Feb 52: 40-46). Specifically, 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3 (2H)-furanone can be
generated from a rhamnose and amine interaction by Amadori formation via the loss of an
amine group, forming 2,3-enolization leading to a diketone, which leads to 4-hydroxy-2,5
dimethyl-3 (2H)furanone after dehydration and cyclization (Pisarnitskii et al. 1992, Appl
Biochem Microbiol28 : 97-100). At basic pH, 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3 (2H)-furanone can
be generated from rhamnose alone, whereas under acidic conditions formation is only found
in presence of an amino acid (e. g. arginine). The combination of rhamnose and arginine
results in 4-hydroxy 2,5-dimethyl-3 (2H)-furanone formation, which is 40-50 fold higher than
any other sugar amine combination (Haleva-Toledo et al. 1997, J Agric Food Chem 45: 1314
1319; 1999, J Agric Food Chem 47: 4140-4145). Maximum 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3 (2H)
furanone generation is found at pH 8.0 with increasing temperature (90 0C) in aqueous buffers.
Lower amount of 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3 (2H)-furanone can also be generated during base
catalyzed fructose degradation (Shaw et al. 1968, J Agric Food Chem 16:979-982).
Amino acids as flavour precursors have been extensively studied in combination with
reducing sugars in water or ethanol model Maillard reaction systems. Among the compounds
known to be generated from proline and rhamnose are 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3 (2H)
furanone and several 2,3-dihydr(lH)-pyrrolizines (Shaw and Ho 1989, Thermal generation of
aromas, eds. Parliament TH, McGorrin RJ, Ho C-T, American Chemical Society, Washington,
DC.; Shaw et al. 1990, Perfumer & Flavorist 15: 60-66; Tressl et al. 1985, J Agric Food Chem
33: 919-923 and J Agric Food Chem 33: 934-928). As 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3 (2H)
furanone is thermally unstable, its concentration is strongly reduced at temperatures higher
than 150 0 C in model aqueous reaction systems. The biscuit/bready/roast flavour attributes
have also been studied in many model systems. Proline was described by Hodge et al. (1972,

Cereal Sci Today 17: 3440) as the key amino acid precursor for roast aroma. It was further
shown by Schieberle (1990, Z Lebensm Unters Forsch 191: 206-209) that a key impact
compound,2-acetyl-1- pyrroline was generated from proline and ornithine. In US-A-3687692
and US-A-3782973 it was reported that proline-based reaction mixtures produced a caramel
character upon heating with cyclic ketones. US 4,022,920 disclosed that Amadori
rearrangement compounds have been produced from proline and 6-deoxy-aldohexoses such as
rhamnose under reflux in ethanol followed by drying. The dried mixture was incorporated
into a food matrix followed by heating.
US 4,940,592 is directed to a process wherein rhamnose is mixed with amino acids such as
leucine, alanine, and phenylalanine in water or propylene glycol, coated onto uncooked
foodstuff followed by microwave radiation. US 5,041,296 also disclosed flavour precursors
treated by microwave radiation before mixing with a foodstuff. EP 0 398 417B1 also disclosed
reactions between rhamnose and proline in other non-fat systems such as water, ethanol,
propylene glycol and glycerol.
W00249452 discloses a process for the production of flavour concentrates comprising the
addition of a mixture of flavour precursors comprising proline, ornithine or protein
hydrolysate, and rhamnose, fructose or fucose, to a fat-based medium and heating the mixture
to about 100-140 C for about 10-120 minutes.
However, there are problems associated with the introduction into baked foodstuffs of flavour
active molecules generated by Maillard reactions.
The time taken to generate appreciable quantities of flavour active materials, for example by
reacting amino acids and reducing sugars, is long relative to the baking times of many baked
products. For example, in US 4,022,920 example 1, 6-deoxy-D-galactose and L-proline are
refluxed in ethanol for 3 hours to generate flavourants. The flavour active reaction products,
extracted into fat, are added to a shortcake dough and baked in example 9 of US 4,022,920
rather than the un-reacted amino acid and reducing sugar.
If mixtures of flavour active molecules are added to ingredients which are then baked (e.g. in
the production of wafer or extruded cereals), many desirable volatile flavour components are
lost. This has a number of disadvantages. The desirable aromas/flavours associated with
volatile compounds are only found in low levels in the finished product (having been lost
during the preparation process). Moreover, many components of the finished flavour may be
flashed off during cooking (so leading to loss from the flavour profile of important aroma
volatiles). This is a particular problem in wafer baking as large volumes of steam are vented

during the baking process which will carry away volatile and water soluble flavour active
molecules. This has two major disadvantages as it removes flavour from the final product and
leads to an unpleasant working environment around the ovens.
W09962357 discloses flavour releasing compositions using micro emulsions where a flavour
precursor is converted into an active flavour in the mouth. The increase in water activity
activates an enzyme to convert the flavour precursor into a flavour. However, such
compositions are not readily applied to ingredients which are baked to form baked foodstuffs.
During baking the micro emulsions will be dehydrated and break down, and any enzymes will
be denatured by the heat.
In baked goods that comprise other components, such as a chocolate coated wafer biscuit, it is
possible to add flavour active molecules generated by reacting flavour precursors into the non
baked component. However, consumers expect the desirable baked flavours to come from the
baked component, and tasting these flavours in a different component such as the chocolate
coating is undesirable as it can seem artificial to the consumer.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
It has been surprisingly found that the addition of flavour precursors (amino acids and
reducing sugars) according to the invention directly to ingredients which are then baked to
form baked foodstuffs overcomes these issues and allows an improved delivery of flavour by
the formation of the aroma molecules even when the baking duration is short. Consequently,
the flavour active molecules generated from the flavour precursors are exposed to high
temperatures for a shorter time leading to a unique and desirable flavour profile and improved
texture.
Without wishing to be bound by theory, the high temperature and pressure generated in such
baking environments as between wafer plates or in the barrel of an extruder create aqueous
conditions above 100 0 C which accelerate the formation of flavour active molecules.
In addition, by adding the flavour precursors to the ingredients of the baked goods they can
react with other components (such as amino acids and sugars in flour) to generate a wider
range of flavour and, as the structure of the baked goods forms at the same time as the flavour
active molecules are generated, the flavour active molecules become trapped within the food
matrix. As less of the flavour active molecules are lost from the foodstuff during baking, the
desirable notes are stronger in the finished baked foodstuff and the environment surrounding
the baking process is pleasanter to work in.

In a further embodiment, the invention deals with a confectionery product comprising the
baked foodstuff according to any of the embodiement above.

The baked foodstuff with an improved flavour according to the invention comprises 2,5-di
methyl-4-hydroxy-3[2H]-furanone, 5-methylfurfural, diacetyl, and 2-acetyl- 1-pyroline. These
aroma compounds impart desirable flavour attributes to the baked foodstuff, particularly in
combination where they provide a balanced flavour to the baked foodstuff. The exact nature
of the flavour notes they provide depends on the relative concentrations, but examples of the
desirable flavour attributes are biscuit, buttery, fruity, nutty, caramel, golden syrup, honey,
toasted, roasted bread-like and baked. The aroma compounds serve to add organoleptic
interest to the baked goods, and provide a particularly desirable flavour for baked foodstuffs
which are used as components of confectionery products.
The baked foodstuff with an improved flavour according to the invention may valuably
additionally comprise 1,2-diacetyl-ethylene, ethyl-pyrazine, 2-ethyl-6-methyl pyrazine, 2
ethyl-5-methyl pyrazine, 2,3-diethyl-pyrazine, 2,5-diethyl-pyrazine, 2,6-diethyl-pyrazine, 5
ethyl-2,3-dimethyl pyrazine and 2-methyl-3,5-diethyl pyrazine.
These aroma compounds also impart desirable flavour attributes to the baked foodstuff,
particularly in combination where they provide a balanced flavour to the baked foodstuff.
In particular, the baked foodstuff according to the invention comprises 5-methylfurfural,
diacetyl, 2,5-di-methyl-4-hydroxy-3[2H]-furanone and 2-acetyl-1-pyroline such that when the
aroma compounds are measured by GC-MS there is a minimum level of 10000 for the peak
corresponding to 5-methylfurfural, and/or a minimum level of 55000 for the peak
corresponding to diacetyl, and/or a minimum level of 50000 for the peak corresponding to
2,5-di-methyl-4-hydroxy-3[2H]-furanone and/or a minimum level of 1000 for the peak
corresponding to 2-acetyl- 1-pyrroline.
As used herein and unless otherwise stated, measurement by GC-MS refers to the method of
sample preparation, solid phase microextraction and GC-MS analysis described in example 2.
The baked foodstuff of the invention may be for example; cake, pastry, snack food, breakfast
cereal, biscuits or cookies, dry petfood, pasteurized foodstuffs, retorted foodstuffs,
microwaveable products, bread, crispbread, breadcrumbs, fried food, ready to re-heat frozen
food items, and mixtures thereof.
In a preferred embodiment, the baked foodstuff of the invention may be baked components of
confectionery.

The baked foodstuff of the invention may be produced by adding the composition of the
invention to other ingredients and then heating e.g. by oven, wafer baking process, infra red
heating system, steam heating, extrusion cooking, microwave cooking, radio frequency oven,
retorting or during pasteurization.
Particularly good results are obtained on improved delivery of the flavours for confectionery
products , and specially when the baked foodstuff is wafer, crackers or extruded cereal and/or
when the baked foodstuff has a cooking time below 5 minutes, preferably below 3 minutes.
In a preferred embodiment the composition according to the invention is used in
confectionery products, said composition being added to the ingredients of baked components
of the confectionery before they are baked. For example the batter in the case of wafer, dough
in the case of biscuits and the ingredient mixture for extruded cereal products.
Wafers are baked products which are made from wafer batter and have crisp, brittle and
fragile consistency. They are thin, with an overall thickness usually between < 1 and 4 mm
and typical product densities range from 0.1 to 0.3 g/cm3. The surfaces are precisely formed,
following the surface shape of the plates between which they were baked. They often carry a
pattern on one surface or on both. Wafers may also be produced by extrusion, according to
our European co-pending patent application No. 06018976.8.
Two basic types of wafer are described by K.F. Tiefenbacher in "Encyclopaedia of Food
Science, Food Technology and Nutrition p 417-420 - Academic Press Ltd London - 1993":
1) No- or low-sugar wafers. The finished biscuits contain from zero to a low percentage of
sucrose or other sugars. Typical products are flat and hollow wafer sheets, moulded cones or
fancy shapes.
2) High-sugar wafers. More than 10% of sucrose or other sugars are responsible for the
plasticity of the freshly baked sheets. They can be formed into different shapes before sugar
recrystallization occurs. Typical products are moulded and rolled sugar cones, rolled wafer
sticks and deep-formed fancy shapes.
Extrusion-cooking of cereal-based compositions is commonly used in the food industry. It is
described for the preparation of edible food product cups in US 5,962,055, in the making of
multiple, complexly patterned extrudates in US 6,251,452 B 1, in the manufacture of
confectionery having coloured fine line (US 6,579,555 BI). US 6,054,166 further describes a
process for making cooked snack by extrusion having a texture similar to traditional tortillas,
crisps, or crackers. The common features of the extrusion processes include the step of

forming an extrudable dough, which may be cooked in a single or a twin-screw extruder
under high temperature, and which is then extruded through a die. Extrusion through a die
may be accompanied by expansion, depending on the water content of the dough and
depending on the pressure at the die. The product may then be cut and/or further processed
and cooled.
It is also an object of the present invention to provide materials and methods for efficiently
generating cooked flavours and aromas in foods which overcome the aforementioned
problems.
According to the present invention there is provided a composition for generating a cooked
flavour in a foodstuff, the composition comprising flavour precursors, which precursors are
non pre-reacted flavour and which react during the cooking of the foodstuff to generate
flavour within the foodstuff.
As used herein, the term "flavour" as applied to a foodstuff includes its aroma, and may refer
in general terms to the organoleptic qualities of the foodstuff. Indeed, those skilled in the art
will recognize that the perceived flavour of any given food depends to a large extent on its
aroma.
As used herein, the term "flavour precursor" is intended to define compounds or chemical
moieties which can take part in one or more reactions which yield products which contribute
to the generation of flavour in a food. Such flavour precursors therefore need not be
flavouring compounds per se.
Thus, the compositions of the invention are activated within the foodstuff, and so generate
flavour compounds in situ. This improves the distribution of the flavour/aroma compounds
throughout the foodstuff and ensures that volatiles (and other "top notes") are more effectively
introduced into the flavour profile.
The precursors selected for use in the invention are such that they give rise to a satisfactorily
broad range of products after entry into the Maillard reaction. This leads to a particularly rich
flavour profile in the food. The precursors for use in the invention may be in powder form,
but preferably the precursors are dissolved/dispersed in water and mixed into the ingredients
of the baked goods.
The composition of the invention comprises a combination of at least one amino acid with at
least one sugar or sugar alcohol. Preferably the composition of the invention comprises a

combination of at least one amino acid with at least one reducing sugar. Examples of suitable
amino acids are ornithine, glycine, glutamine, citrulline, arginine, proline, histidine, cysteine
or mixtures thereof. Examples of suitable reducing sugars are fructose, glucose, xylose,
tagatose, rhamnose, maltose, lactose, fucose, arabinose, galactose or mixtures thereof.
In another preferred embodiment of the invention the amino acid is ornithine and the reducing
sugar is xylose. In another preferred embodiment of the invention the amino acid is ornithine
and the reducing sugars is rhamnose. In another preferred embodiment of the invention the
amino acid is proline and the reducing sugars is rhamnose. In another preferred embodiment
of the invention the amino acid is histidine andthe reducing sugar is rhamnose. In another
preferred embodiment of the invention the amino acid is glutamine and the reducing sugars is
rhamnose.
The flavour generated by the compositions of the invention may be biscuit, buttery, fruity,
nutty, caramel, bread-like, golden syrup, honey, toasted, roasted and baked.
The composition of the invention may be used with the ingredients of any foodstuff, for
example; baked components of confectionery, breadcrumbs, dry petfood, pasteurized
foodstuffs, retorted foodstuffs, microwaveable products, bread, snack food and mixtures
thereof.
The composition of the invention is typically prepared by mixing the at least one amino acid
with the at least one reducing sugar. These can be dry powders, or dissolved/dispersed in
water. Preferably the at least one amino acid and the at least one reducing sugar are mixed
together with the ingredients of baked goods before the ingredients are baked. It will be
appreciated that some baked foodstuffs typically include reducing sugars as an ingredient.
For example, Brandy Snaps are usually made with Golden Syrup in a one-to-one ratio with
the flour. Typically, about 50% of Golden Syrup is invert syrup (glucose and fructose). A
typical composition of the invention comprises:
Flour              100 parts
Water              from 5 to 200 parts
Amino acid(s)      from 0.01 to 1 part, more preferably from 0.03 to 0.70parts, most
                   preferably from 0.03 to 0.66 parts
Reducing sugar(s)       from 0.05 to 100 parts, more preferably from 0.09 to 5 parts, most
                   preferably from 0.09 to 2 parts

Many baked foodstuffs contain yeast which in some cases can influence flavour formation.
The compositions of this invention can be used in baked foodstuffs with or without yeast, or
where the only yeast ingredient is Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
In one embodiment of the invention the at least one amino acid and the at least one reducing
sugar are mixed with the ingredients of a ready to bake product which is then frozen to be
baked at a later time.
It is also contemplated that the at least one amino acid and at least one reducing sugar may be
partially pre-reacted. That is to say, reacted by one of the methods known in the art to
generate flavour active molecules, but for temperatures and times which do not completely
react away the amino acids and reducing sugars. This provides the benefit of using precisely
controlled conditions to manipulate the formation of desirable flavour active molecules, but
permits the remaining flavour pre-cursors in the mixture also to take part in flavour generating
reactions during the cooking process.
In another aspect, the invention contemplates a process for producing a foodstuff comprising
the step of adding to a foodstuff the composition of the invention (for example by dusting or
by inclusion, optionally followed by heating (e.g. by convection oven, impingement oven,
wafer baking, infra red heating, steam heating, extrusion cooking, microwave cooking,
retorting or during pasteurization.)
The baked foodstuff of the invention also exhibits improved texture, especially increased
crispness.
Crispness is an attribute that relates to the number of mechanical fractures that occur upon
application of a certain force and to the magnitude of the force needed to cause a fracture.
Ways to quantify crispness are known in the art, notably from Mitchell, J.R. et al. in Journal
of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 80, 1679-1685, 2000. Thus, crispness can be
quantified by a number of parameters.
In the case of wafer, it is possible to measure crispness using a crush test (described in
example 2). This measures the force needed to fracture a wafer. The test uses a cylindrical
probe having a 4mm diameter and a flat face for penetrating the wafer.
By applying a force onto the wafer with the probe, microfractures occur until the wafer can no
longer be crushed. These fractures are related to the crispness perception when eating the
product.

Referring to Figure 3 showing a typical crush test force diagram, it can be seen that each time
a microfracture occurs, a force drop is observed in the force applied to the wafer (indicated by
arrows on Figure 3). How many force drops occur in a specified distance (mm) and the
magnitude of the force drops are indicative of the crispness of the wafer.
It has been determined that force drops greater than 0.2N in magnitude but less than 0.6N are
especially relevant to the assessment of crispness as they provide a good correlation to the
sensory perception of crispness, notably to the acoustics associated with crispness.
Thus, by selecting the force drops which are greater than 0.2N in magnitude (number of force
drops a) and then selecting the force drops which are greater than 0.6N in magnitude (number
of force drops 0) and subtracting 0 from a, it is possible to establish a number of force drops
between 0.2N and 0.6N, per mm of distance travelled by the crush test probe.
This is illustrated in Figure 4, wherein several wafers are compared. A wafer formulated
without an amino acid and a reducing sugar (wafer A) exhibit fewer force drops per mm than
the same recipe but with added amine and reducing sugar (wafers C-I). That is to say wafer A
is less crisp. The effect is an additional benefit to the flavour impact and is equivalent to
adding extra sugar into the wafer batter (wafer B), but without the effect of extra sweetness
which can be undesirable.

Standards:
Four aroma molecules were quantified using authentic standards (standards for the other
molecules not being commercially available). Aqueous solutions were prepared according to
the following table:
                                                Dilutions [gg/ml]

Solid phase microextraction (SPME)
Wafer sample was crushed with pestle and mortar just before analysis. 200 mg of the
powdered wafer were introduced into a 20 mL vial and suspended into 5 mL of 25% NaCl. A
stirring magnet was added and the vial was immediately sealed by a septum. The slurry was
stirred at 500 rpm and at room temperature. After equilibration for 1 hour, the SPME fibre
was exposed to the headspace, for again 1 hour while temperature and stirring were
maintained, before injection into the GC system.
Quantification was performed spiking wafers with 5 different levels of standard molecules.
This was done adding 50 pl of the standard solution to the 200mg of powdered wafer in the
sampling procedure above. All wafer samples were treated in this way, all showing linear
relation of peak area as a function of the added amount of standard compounds. However the
slopes of the linear straight lines varied, indicating changes in the air/water partition and/or
preferential adsorption onto the SPME fiber depending on the global aroma composition of
each wafer. Consequently, each individual wafer sample was analyzed using its own
calibration.
Spiking with standard solutions was used to determine a linear regression of peak area as a
function of the concentration of the added aroma compound. Initial concentration in 5

The analysis for 2,5-di-methyl-4-hydroxy-3[2H]-furanone was made by SPME of dry wafer
as 2,5-di-methyl-4-hydroxy-3[2H]-furanone is a polar molecule and would not be readily
extracted from the aqueous phase. In this case, 2 g of powdered wafer were introduced into a
10 mL vial. After sealing, the latter was thermostated at 70'C without any stirring. After
equilibration for 1 hour, the SPME fibre was exposed to the headspace, for again 1 hour while
temperature and stirring were maintained, before injection into the GC system.
GC-MS analysis

Manual injection was performed introducing the fibre into the injector set at 220'C. Splitless
mode was used with a purge after 3 min at a flow rate of 50 mL/min. After 5 min, the fibre
was removed from the injector and immediately exposed to the next sample. The oven
temperature gradient started with a delay of 5 min, from 20'C to 220'C at a rate of 40 C/min.
The final temperature was hold for another 5 min period. Helium was used as carrier gas at a
constant flow of 1.5 mL/min. the mass spectrometer was operated in electron impact mode at
70 eV, with transfer line and source temperatures of 150'C and 230'C respectively. Masses
were scanned from 20 to 400 Da. Specific ion chromatograms were then extracted for each
individual aroma molecule, according to the following list:

*: analyzed by SPME of dry wafer
As an example of how to read Table 1, it can be seen that for wafer E (the ingredients of
which comprised histidine and xylose) the amount of 5-methyl-furfural is quantified by a
peak area of 53512 based on the mass spectrometer response for the ion m/e =110 . The peak
had a retention time of 27.6 minutes. By comparison, KNISTERBROT wafer had a lower
amount of 5-methyl-furfural with a peak area of 4872.
For each wafer, the ratio of peak area to the corresponding peak area for wafer A was
calculated for each aroma molecule. These ratios are presented in Table 2. As an example of

how to read Table 2, it can be seen that for wafer E (the ingredients of which comprised
histidine and xylose) the amount of 5-methyl-furfural is quantified by peak area ratio as 59
times higher than in Wafer A based on the mass spectrometer response for the ion m/e  = 110 .
The peak had a retention time of 27.6 minutes. By comparison, KNISTERBROT wafer had
only 6.4 times more of 5-methyl-furfural than Wafer A.

Example 3: Examination of wafers by Gas Chromatography - Olfactometry
Wafers A and D of example 1 were also analysed by Gas Chromatography - Olfactometry
(GC-0). The analysis was carried out in a similar manner to the GC-MS, except that an odour
port supplied with humidified air (SGE, ODO-1) was substituted for the Agilent 5973N mass
spectrometer and extra wafer was used to ease detection by human sniffers. Wafer was ground
to a powder using a mechanical grinder. In this case, wafer powder (2g) was weighed into a
20ml crimp-top headspace vial and Ig of saturated sodium chloride solution was added. Each
vial was equilibrated for 60min at 55 'C and the headspace volatiles adsorbed onto a PDMS
DVB SPME fibre (Supelco) for 30min, again at 55 'C. The volatiles were desobed for 5min at
220 'C in the injector of an Agilent 6890 GC in splitless mode, and separated on a 60m x
0.25mm i.d DB-Wax column (J&W) using the following conditions: 40 'C (5min) - 230 'C
(10min) at 3 'C min-1. Trained subjects ("Sniffers") sniffed compounds eluting from the end
of the GC-column and recorded their comments together with the time at which the odours
were perceived.
A CombiPal (CTC Analytics) was used to automate the equilibration, adsorption and
desorption processes.
This process was repeated with column outlet connected to an Agilent 5793N mass
spectrometer. Eluting compounds were fragmented by electron impact ionisation (EI). Peaks
were detected using Agilent GC-MS data analysis software. Identification of components was
by comparison of fragmentation patterns to those of spectral libraries such as NIST05.
Reference materials of known identity were injected into both GC-O and GC-MS instruments
in order to calibrate for any time differences associated with the high vacuum of the mass
spectrometer and to allow correlation between the compounds detected and their individual
odours. Such analyses have been performed a minimum of two times.
Figures 1 and 2 shows the GC-MS trace (mass spectrometer total ion response plotted against
time in minutes) annotated at the corresponding time with the descriptions of aroma recorded
by the Sniffers. Figure 1 is the result for Wafer A and Figure 2 for Wafer D. It is worth
noting that the proximity of a description to a prominent peak does not necessarily mean that
the aroma being described comes from that peak.        The sensitivity of the human nose is
different to the sensitivity of the mass spectrometer and so very small peaks on the GC-MS
trace may provide a strong aroma and conversely large peaks on the GC-MS trace may not
have a discernable aroma. It is also worth noting that the retention times for the peaks in
Figure 1 are not directly comparable with those in example 2 (Table 1) as a different length
column and GC oven temperature conditions have been used.

Example 4: Texture analysis of wafers by crush test
The wafers produced in example 1 were analyzed by a crush test
Sample: wafer of at least 2cm2 .
Measurements were repeated for 10 samples of each product type and an average was taken.
Instrument: Stable Micro Systems TA-XTplus
Penetration probe: 4mm diameter cylinder (Stable Micro Systems P/4)
Instrument settings:
        Compression mode
        Test speed: 1mm s-I
        Target strain: 90%
        Trigger force: 0.5N
Analysis:
The force/distance curve (Figure 3) looks jagged because the force drops each time a fracture
occurs; these fractures are related to the crispness perception when eating the product. At the
end of the test the force rises sharply due to densification of the sample. The analysis macro
calculates the average force for the whole test. It then selects a region for analysis from when
the probe first contacts the sample to when the force first rises above the average value (this is
to avoid including the densification region of the curve in the analysis). The macro then
counts the number of force drops (i.e. negative peaks) above a threshold of 0.2N and the
number of force drops above a threshold of 0.6N. The operator then subtracts one value from
the other to give the number of force drops between 0.2N and 0.6N (these thresholds were
chosen on the basis of good correlation to sensory perception of crispness). The number of
force drops in the analysis region is normalised by dividing through by the distance travelled
in the analysis region, to give the number of force drops per unit distance.
Figure 4 shows the data obtained for the wafers. It can be seen that the wafer with no amino
acid or reducing sugar (Wafer A) has a lower crispness than the other samples.
