                                               Abstract
The invention is related to a universal Joiner for square hollow section (SHS) structural steel framing,
for all building classes and selected industrial applications. It is designed to eliminate on site welding
and create seamless butt joints between Steel members.
The concealed joining system works by slotting the spigot piece inside accompanying SHS steel
tubes to create a strong, clean, neat and easy to fit structural joint. This creates consistent square
corners, enabling the direct fixing of many factory manufactured square corner products such as
windows, standard wall framing and sheeting.

   Econic Spigot, for concealed square hollow
   section (SHS) Structural Steel joints.
  The improved structural concealed Spigot Joiner.
   Provisional Application.
   I have developed a universal Joiner for square hollow section (SHS) structural steel framing, for all building classes
   and selected industrial applications. It is designed to eliminate on site welding and create seamless butt joints
   between Steel members.
  This concealed joining system works by slotting the spigot piece inside accompanying SHS steel tubes to create a
  strong, clean, neat and easy to fit structural joint. This creates consistent square corners, enabling the direct fixing of
   many factory manufactured square corner products such as windows, standard wall framing and sheeting.
  This eliminates the need for on-site welding that requires skilled tradesman and additional workplace safety.
   On-site welding produces noise, gasses, splatter, blinding light and distorts members leaving raised surfaces and
   making it difficult to fit square corner products.
  The Econic Spigot creates easy low skilled workplace construction procedures and addresses a large range of work
   place safety problems such as power leads, welding flash, welding fumes, fire hazards, extra scaffolding, and control
   barriers.
  The accuracy of each joint enables pre-ordering and fabrication of precise fitting products, enabling accurate, safe
   and time efficient low skilled frame assembling.
   It is engineered to withstand large loads with its reinforced thick walling, giving minimal tolerance between
   components creating strong accurate joins.
   It provides versatility with its capitulated nut and also enables multiple components to be joined together in close
   proximity with ease and minimal interference.
   Features are its simplicity, and strength in complex concealed joint applications, a key component of the Econic
   modular building system. This creates the ability to solve complex steel frame assembly with safety and ease. When
   used with accompanying Steel RHS member tubes at specified lengths this enables a modular building system,
   Bolting rather than welding enables simple future expansion. In this way the Econic spigot becomes a DIY modular
   house frame and expandable construction tool.
  This system supports first home owners in creating an option to start small and add modular components as they can
   afford to grow. This would reduce the need to borrow large amounts of money or continually selling and buying until
  they get their dream home. eliminating the stress of mortgages and relocating.
  The Econic Joiner will be offered as a standalone component or part of a complete construction package option. The
   Econic design team offer a design service based on your ideas using our experience, systems and technologies.
   Developed from standard steel section sizes brought together to create the Econic Spigot, this innovative product
  supports standard building practices with an easy an improved joiner for many structural applications within the
   building & construction industry.
