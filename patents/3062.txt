WO 2015/069809                                                    PCT/US2014/064184
[00831      Some embodiments include a method of increasing the metabolic lifetime
of dextromethorphan, comprising administering an antidepressant compound, such
as bupropion, to a human being, wherein the human being is an extensive
metabolizer of dextromethorphan, and wherein dextromethorphan is present in the
body of the human being at the same time as the antidepressant compound.
[0084]      Some embodiments include a method of correcting extensive metabolism
of dextromethorphan, comprising administering an antidepressant compound, such
as bupropion, to a human being in need thereof, such as a human being in need of
treatment for pain.
[0085]      Some embodiments include a method of improving the therapeutic
properties of dextromethorphan       in treating neurological disorders comprising
administering an antidepressant compound, such as bupropion, in conjunction with
administration of dextromethorphan to a human being in need of treatment for a
neurological disorder.
[0086]      Some embodiments include a method of treating neurological disorders
comprising administering a combination of an antidepressant compound, such as
bupropion, and dextromethorphan to a human being in need thereof.
[0087]      Dextromethorphan has the structure shown below.
[0088]      Dextromethorphan is used as a cough suppressant. According to the
FDA's dextromethorphan product labeling requirement under the OTC Monograph
[21 CFR341.74], dextromethorphan should be dosed 6 times a day (every 4 hours), 4
times a day (every 6 hours), or 3 times a day (every 8 hours).
[0089]      Dextromethorphan is rapidly metabolized in the human liver. This rapid
hepatic metabolism may limit systemic drug exposure in individuals who are
extensive metabolizers.     Human beings can be: 1) extensive metabolizers of
                                           15

 WO 2015/069809                                                        PCT/US2014/064184
dextromethorphan -       those who rapidly metabolize dextromethorphan; 2) poor
metabolizers    of   dextromethorphan    -    those   who    only   poorly   metabolize
dextromethorphan; or 3) intermediate metabolizers of dextromethorphan -            those
whose metabolism of dextromethorphan is somewhere between that of an extensive
metabolizer and a poor metabolizer. Extensive metabolizers can also be ultra-rapid
metabolizers. Extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan are a significant portion
of the human population.     Dextromethorphan can, for example, be metabolized to
dextrorphan.
[0090]      When given the same oral dose of dextromethorphan, plasma levels of
dextromethorphan are significantly higher in poor metabolizers or intermediate
metabolizers as compared to extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan. The low
plasma concentrations of dextromethorphan can limit its clinical utility as a single
agent for extensive metabolizers, and possibly intermediate             metabolizers, of
dextromethorphan.         Some   antidepressants, such as bupropion, inhibit the
metabolism of dextromethorphan, and can thus improve its therapeutic efficacy.
Similarly, antidepressants may allow dextromethorphan to be given less often, such
as once a day instead of twice a day, once a day instead of three times a day, once
a day instead of four times a day, twice a day instead of three times a day, or twice a
day instead of four times a day, without loss of therapeutic efficacy.
[0091]      Pain or other neurological disorders may be treated by a method
comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of dextromethorphan
and a therapeutically effective amount of an antidepressant compound, such as
bupropion, hydroxybupropion, erythrohydroxybupropion, threohydroxybupropion, or
a metabolite or prodrug of any of these compounds, to a person in need thereof.
[0092]      Examples of neurological disorders that may be treated, or that may be
treated with increased efficacy, by a combination of dextromethorphan and an
antidepressant such as bupropion, hydroxybupropion, erythrohydroxybupropion,
threohydroxybupropion, or a metabolite or prodrug of any of these compounds,
include, but are not limited to: affective disorders, psychiatric disorders, cerebral
function disorders, movement disorders, dementias, motor neuron diseases,
neurodegenerative diseases, seizure disorders, and headaches.

erythrohydroxybupropion, threohydroxybupropion, or a metabolite or prodrug of any
of these compounds.
[00109]     These methods may be used to treat, or provide relief to, any type of pain
including, but not limited to, musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, cancer-related
pain, acute pain, nociceptive pain, etc.
[00110]     Examples of musculoskeletal pain include low back pain (i.e. lumbosacral
pain), primary dysmenorrhea, and arthritic pain, such as pain associated with
rheumatoid     arthritis,    juvenile    rheumatoid      arthritis,   osteoarthritis,   axial
spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis, etc.
[00111]     In some embodiments, a combination of dextromethorphan and an
antidepressant, such as bupropion, is used to treat chronic musculoskeletal pain.
[00112]     Examples of neuropathic pain include diabetic peripheral neuropathy,
post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, monoradiculopathies, phantom limb
pain, central pain, etc. Other causes of neuropathic pain include cancer-related pain,
lumbar nerve root compression, spinal cord injury, post-stroke pain, central multiple
sclerosis pain, HIV-associated neuropathy, and radio- or chemo-therapy associated
neuropathy, etc.
[00113]     The term "treating" or "treatment" includes the diagnosis, cure, mitigation,
treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals, or any activity that
otherwise affects the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.
[00114]     Any antidepressant may be used in combination with dextromethorphan
to improve the therapeutic properties of dextromethorphan.           Dextromethorphan and
the antidepressant compound may be administered in separate compositions or
dosage forms, or may be administered in a single composition or dosage form
comprising both.
[00115]     Antidepressant       compounds      that   can     be    co-administered     with

[00116]     Bupropion has the structure shown below (bupropion hydrochloride form
shown).

[00117]     Combining     bupropion with dextromethorphan        may provide greater
efficacy, such as greater pain relief, than would otherwise be achieved by
administering either component alone. In extensive metabolizers, dextromethorphan
can be rapidly and extensively metabolized, yielding low systemic exposure even at
high doses.        Bupropion,  besides possessing anti-depressant and analgesic
properties,   is an inhibitor of dextromethorphan       metabolism.      Metabolites of
bupropion, which include hydroxybupropion, threohydroxybupropion (also known as
threohydrobupropion or threodihydrobupropion), and erythrohydroxybupropion (also
known as erythrohydrobupropion or erythrodihydrobupropion), are also inhibitors of
dextromethorphan metabolism. Thus, bupropion is a prodrug of hydroxybupropion,
threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion.
[00118]     As explained above, this inhibition may augment dextromethorphan
plasma levels, resulting in additive or synergistic efficacy such as relief of
neurological disorders including pain, depression, smoking cessation, etc. Thus,
while inhibition of dextromethorphan metabolism is only one of many potential
benefits of the combination, co-administration of dextromethorphan with bupropion
may thereby enhance the efficacy of bupropion for many individuals.                 Co
administration of dextromethorphan with bupropion may enhance the analgesic
                                           22

 WO 2015/069809                                                         PCT/US2014/064184
properties of bupropion for many individuals. Co-administration of dextromethorphan
with bupropion may also enhance the antidepressant properties of bupropion for
many individuals, including faster onset of action.
[00119]       Another potential benefit of co-administration of dextromethorphan and
bupropion is that it may be useful to reduce the potential for an adverse event, such
as somnolence, associated with treatment by dextromethorphan.              This may be
useful, for example, in human patients at risk of experiencing the adverse event as a
result being treated with dextromethorphan.
[00120]       Another potential benefit of co-administration of dextromethorphan and
bupropion is that it may be useful to reduce the potential for an adverse event, such
as    seizure,     associated     with  treatment   by   bupropion,    hydroxybupropion,
erythrohydroxybupropion, threohydroxybupropion, or a metabolite or prodrug of any
of these compounds. This may be useful, for example, in human patients at risk of
experiencing the       adverse event as a result being          treated with bupropion,
hydroxybupropion, erythrohydroxybupropion, threohydroxybupropion, or a metabolite
or prodrug of any of these compounds.
[00121]       With   respect     to  dextromethorphan,    bupropion,   hydroxybupropion,
erythrohydroxybupropion, threohydroxybupropion, or a metabolite or prodrug of any
of these compounds, co-administration may reduce a central nervous system
adverse event, a gastrointestinal event, or another type of adverse event associated
with any of these compounds.            Central nervous system (CNS) adverse events
include, but are not limited to, nervousness, dizziness, sleeplessness, light
headedness, tremor, hallucinations, convulsions, CNS depression, fear, anxiety,
headache,      increased irritability or excitement, tinnitus, drowsiness, dizziness,
sedation, somnolence, confusion, disorientation, lassitude, incoordination, fatigue,
euphoria, nervousness, insomnia, sleeping disturbances, convulsive seizures,
excitation,    catatonic-like states,    hysteria, hallucinations, delusions,   paranoia,
headaches and/or migraine, and extrapyramidal symptoms such as oculogyric crisis,
torticollis, hyperexcitability, increased muscle tone, ataxia, and tongue protrusion.
[00122]       Gastrointestinal adverse events include, but are not limited to, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, dysphagia, dyspepsia, diarrhea, abdominal distension,
flatulence, peptic ulcers with bleeding, loose stools, constipation, stomach pain,

heartburn, gas, loss of appetite, feeling of fullness in stomach, indigestion, bloating,
hyperacidity, dry mouth, gastrointestinal disturbances, and gastric pain.
[00123]      Co-administering dextromethorphan and an antidepressant, such as
bupropion, hydroxybupropion, erythrohydroxybupropion, threohydroxybupropion, or
a metabolite or prodrug of any of these compounds, does not necessarily require
that the two compounds be administered in the same dosage form.            For example,
the two compounds may be administered in a single dosage form, or they may be
administered in two separate dosage forms. Additionally, the two compounds may
be administered at the same time, but this is not required. The compounds can be
given at different times as long as both are in a human body at the same time for at
least a portion of the time that treatment by co-administration is being carried out.
[00124]      In some embodiments, co-administration of a combination of bupropion,
hydroxybupropion, erythrohydroxybupropion, threohydroxybupropion, or a metabolite
or prodrug of any of these compounds, and dextromethorphan results in both
bupropion, hydroxybupropion, erythrohydroxybupropion, threohydroxybupropion, or
a metabolite or prodrug of any of these compounds, and dextromethorphan
contributing to the pain relieving properties of the combination.      For example, the
combination may have improved pain relieving properties as compared to bupropion,
hydroxybupropion, erythrohydroxybupropion, threohydroxybupropion, or a metabolite
or prodrug of any of these compounds, alone or compared to dextromethorphan
alone, including potentially faster onset of action.
[00125]      In some embodiments, the combination may have improved pain
relieving properties of at least about 0.5%, at least about 1 %, at least about 10%, at
least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 50%, at least 100%, up to about

[00129]     A dosage form or a composition may be a blend or mixture of
dextromethorphan       and   a    compound    that    inhibits   the   metabolism     of
dextromethorphan, such as bupropion, hydroxybupropion, erythrohydroxybupropion,
threohydroxybupropion, or a metabolite or prodrug of any of these compounds,
either alone or within a vehicle. For example, dextromethorphan and bupropion may
be dispersed within each other or dispersed together within a vehicle. A dispersion
may include a mixture of solid materials wherein small individual particles are
substantially one compound, but the small particles are dispersed within one
another, such as might occur if two powders of two different drugs are blended with a
solid vehicle material, and the blending is done in the solid form.           In some
embodiments, dextromethorphan and bupropion may be substantially uniformly
dispersed within a composition or dosage form. Alternatively, dextromethorphan and
bupropion may be in separate domains or phases within a composition or dosage
form. For example, one drug may be in a coating and another drug may be in a core
within the coating. For example, one drug may be formulated for sustained release
and another drug may be formulated for immediate release.

[00130]       Some embodiments include administration of a tablet that contains
bupropion in a form that provides sustained release and dextromethorphan in a form
that provides immediate release. While there are many ways that sustained release
of bupropion may be achieved, in some embodiments bupropion is combined with
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.     For example, particles of bupropion hydrochloride
could be blended with microcrystalline cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
(e.g METHOCEL@) to form an admixture of blended powders. This could then be
combined with immediate release dextromethorphan in a single tablet.

carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard
pharmaceutical practice as described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical
Sciences, 2005. The relative proportions of active ingredient and carrier may be
determined, for example, by the solubility and chemical nature of the compounds,
chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.
[00132]      Therapeutic compounds may be administered by any means that may
result in the contact of the active agent(s) with the desired site or site(s) of action in
the body of a patient. The compounds may be administered by any conventional
means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals, either as individual
therapeutic agents or in a combination of therapeutic agents. For example, they may
be administered as the sole active agents in a pharmaceutical composition, or they
can be used in combination with other therapeutically active ingredients.
[00133]      Therapeutic compounds may be administered to a human patient in a
variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, e.g., orally or

[00190]     Phenotypic determination of dextromethorphan metabolizer status was
performed by calculating the dextromethorphan/dextrorphan             metabolic ratio as
described in Jurica et al. Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics, 2012, 37,
486-490. Plasma concentrations of dextromethorphan and dextrorphan 3 hours after
dosing were used, with a dextromethorphan/dextrorphan ratio of 0.3 or greater
indicating a poor metabolizer phenotype.

[00198]     Phenotypic     determination    of dextromethorphan      metabolizer status
showed that no subjects in either treatment arm were poor metabolizers on Day 1.
On Day 8 however, 100% of subjects treated with bupropion had converted to poor
metabolizer status as compared to 0% of subjects treated with dextromethorphan
alone. The mean plasma dextromethorphan/dextrorphan metabolic ratio increased
from 0.01 on Day 1 to 0.71 on Day 8 with bupropion administration. The mean ratio
in the group administered DM alone was 0.00 on Day 1 and remained unchanged on
Day 8.

hydroxybupropion, erythrohydroxybupropion, and threohydroxybupropion were at
least 10 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and 100 ng/mL, respectively after bupropion
administration.
[00200]     As used in this section, the term "fold change" or "fold increase" refers to
the ratio of a value for bupropion with dextromethorphan to the same value for
dextromethorphan alone (i.e. the value for bupropion with dextromethorphan divided
by the same value for dextromethorphan alone).

used in the specification and claims are to be understood in all instances as
indicating both the exact values as shown and as being modified by the term "about."
Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in
the specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending
upon the desired properties sought to be obtained. At the very least, and not as an
