   TECHNICAL FIELD
   [0001b] The present invention relates to a composition that enhances the plant disease
   control effect of a monosaccharide contained as an active ingredient thereof, by
   incorporating at least one or more assistants, selected from a specific nonionic
15 surfactant, specific anionic surfactant, cationic surfactant, amphoteric surfactant,
   water-soluble polymer, amino acid, amino sugar, disaccharide alcohol and salt, into a
   composition containing a monosaccharide as an active ingredient thereof, a method for
   controlling plant disease by using that composition, and a method for enhancing the
   control effects of a monosaccharide on plant disease.
20
   BACKGROUND ART a
   [0002] In the agricultural industry, plant disease control agents, namely agricultural
   chemicals, are used for the purpose of controlling plant diseases in the manner of
   fungicides and the like with the objective of reducing labor and stabilizing the quality
25 and yield of agricultural products, and are essential for present-day agriculture in terms
   of ensuring safe and reliable agricultural products.    However, as a result of having
   frequently or excessively used numerous chemical agents having the same mechanism
   of action among plant disease control agents to a specific plant disease as a target for
   control, a phenomenon is occurring in which target plant disease pathogens develop
30 tolerance to agricultural chemicals having that mechanism of action.
   [0003]     On the other hand, there has recently been a growing interest among consumers
   in agricultural products grown with reduced levels of agricultural chemicals as well as
   social interest in reducing the environmental effects of chemically synthesized plant
   disease control agents.    Amidst these circumstances, there is a desire for plant disease
35 control agents and plant disease control methods that have less effect on the
   environment in comparison with conventional chemically synthesized plant disease
   control agents, have a broad spectrum against various plant diseases, and are effective
   even against resistant microorganisms for which existing plant disease control agents
   are no longer effective.
40 [0004]     Monosaccharides are sugars that are the constituent elements of
   polysaccharides or oligosaccharides that cannot be further hydrolyzed, and are typically

                                                    -2
   classified into aldoses, ketoses, sugar alcohols (polyols) and the like according to
   functional groups contained in their chemical structures. Examples of aldoses include
   glucose, mannose, allose, altrose, talose, galactose, idose, gulose, ribose, lyxose, xylose,
   arabinose, erythrose, treose and glyceraldehyde; examples of ketoses include fructose,
 5 psicose, tagatose, sorbose, xylulose, ribulose, erythrulose and dihydroxyacetone;
   examples of sugar alcohols include glucitol, mannitol, altritol, iditol, allitol, galactitol,
   arabitol, xylitol, ribitol, threitol, erythritol, glycerin, inositol and quercitol. In addition,
   nearly all of these have D-form and L-form optical isomers.
   [0005] Some monosaccharides are known to enhance disease resistance in plants when
10 administered to a plant (Patent Documents I and 2). In addition, monosaccharides
   have been reported to be effective as plant disease control agents with respect to actual
   plants. For example, D-tagatose has been determined to exhibit control effects against
   diseases caused by obligate parasites, such as microorganisms causing downy mildew
   (such as Pseudoperonosporacubensis, Plasmoparaviticola or Peronosporaparasitica),
15 microorganisms causing powdery mildew (such as Sphaerothecafiuliginea)or
   microorganisms causing rust disease (such as Puccinia recondita),and diseases caused
   by oomycetes such as Phytophthorainfestans or Pythium species, and to be useful as
   plant disease control agents (Patent Document 3). In addition, D-talose has been
   determined to be effective as a control agent of plant diseases caused by Magnaporthe
20 grisea, Colletotrichum orbiculare,Alternariabrassicicola,Cochijobolus miyabeanus,
   Venturia inaequalis,Blumeria graminis f sp. hordei, Sphaerothecafuliginea,
   Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, Pseudomonassyringae pv. lachrymans and Ralstonia
   solanacearun,L-fructose has been determined to be effective as a control agent of plant
   diseases caused by Colletotrichum orbiculare.Alternaria brassicicola,Pythium species
25 causing of damping-off of cucumber seedlings, Pseudomonassyringae pv. lachrymans
   and Ralstonia solanacearum,D-allose has been determined to be effective as a control
   agent of plant diseases caused by Magnaporthegrisea, Colletotrichum orbiculare,
   Alternaria brassicicola,Sphaerothecafuliginea,Phytophthorainfestans,
   Pseudoperonosporacubensis and Pythiurn species causing damping-off of cucumber
30 seedlings, D-psicose has been determined to be effective as a control agent of plant
   diseases caused by Magnaporthegrisea, Colletotrichum orbiculare,Blumeria graminis
   f. sp. hordei, Sphaerothecafuliginea,Pseudononassyringae pv. lachrynans and
   Ralstoniasolanacearum,D-galactose has been determined to be effective as a control
   agent of plant diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani,Pythium species causing
35 damping-off of cucumber seedlings, Phytophthorainfestans and Erwinia carotovora
   subsp. carotovora,D-sorbose has been determined to be effective as a control agent of

                                                  -3
     plant diseases caused by Pseudomonassyringae pv. lachrymans and Ralsionia
     solanacearum,D-mannose has been determined to be effective as a control agent of
     plant diseases caused by Pseudoinonassvringae pv. lachrvymans, and D-mannitol has
     been determined to be effective as a control agent of plant diseases caused by
  5  Xanthononas oryzae pv. oryzae and Pseudomonassyringae pv. lachrymans (Patent
     Documents 4 and 5). However, the comparatively high treatment concentrations of
     these monosaccharides as plant disease control agents, and their inadequate dilutability
     and dispersibility when dissolving the monosaccharides in a spray solution to prepare
     chemical agents, have been indicated as problems,
 10  [0006]   Combinations of D-tagatose with other sugars and substances having
     bactericidal and/or fungicidal action are described in Patent Document 3 with respect to
     synergistic control effects resulting from combining monosaccharides with other
     substances. However, test examples are indicated only for neutral monosaccharides as
    the other monosaccharides, while there is no description of the efficacy of disaccharides
 15  or other sugars.
     [0007]   In addition, surfactants have widely been known to be able to be used to
    enhance the efficacy of chemical agents used as agricultural chemicals. However,
    since agricultural chemicals are usually liposoluble compounds and the prior art has
    attempted to enhance the efficacy of such compounds, which is for a stronger sense of
20  compound-stabilizing efficacy rather than enhancing efficacy.
    [0008]    On the other hand, monosaccharides are compounds that exhibit extremely
    high water solubility and are present in an equilibrium state of a-pyranose, p-pyranose,
    a-furanose,   p-furanose  and linear structures in an aqueous solution, therefore the effects
    of conventional agricultural chemical assistants on such compounds was completely
25  unknown. Although monosaccharides have been described in Patent Documents 3, 4
    and 5 as being effective as plant disease control agents, and it is also described that
    various surfactants can be used as assistants for enhancing efficacy, there are no test
    examples regarding the efficacy of actual assistants.

   improvement in preventive value attributable to the formulas of the present invention
   with respect to a formula containing D-tagatose only was evaluated using the same
   indices as Test Example I as indicators.      The improvement in efficacy with respect to
   cucumber downy mildew was evaluated based on the control effect of a 200-fold
 5 dilution (treatment concentrations: D-tagatose 0.4% + assistant 0.1%), while the
   improvement in efficacy with respect to other diseases was evaluated based on the
   control effect of a 100-fold dilution (treatment concentrations: D-tagatose 0.8%,
   assistant: 0.2%).    Those results are shown in Table 5.
   [0109] The preventive value of the formula containing D-tagatose only with respect to
10 cucumber downy mildew at a treatment concentration of 0.4% was about 50 (40 to 60),
   the preventive value with respect to grave vine downy mildew at a treatment
   concentration of 0.8% was about 40 (30 to 50), the preventive value with respect to
   cucumber powdery mildew at a treatment concentration of 0.8% was about 50 (40 to
   60), and the preventive value with respect to wheat rash at a treatment concentration of
15 0.8% was about 5 (0 to 10).
   [0110]    Remarkable improvements in control effects against cucumber downy mildew,
   grave vine downy mildew, cucumber powdery mildew and wheat rust were observed
   with formulas containing as assistants nonionic surfactants selected from
   polyoxyalkylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyalkylene alkyl amines, alkyl polyglycosides,
20 polyoxyalkylene aryl ethers, glycerin fatty acid esters, polyglycerin fatty acid esters,
   propylene glycol fatty acid esters, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan
   fatty acid esters, fatty acid diethanolamines and alkyl imidazolinones with respect to the
   formula containing only D-tagatose as monosaccharide.         On the other hand,
   remarkable improvements in control effects were not observed with formulas containing
25 fluorine-based surfactants, silicone-based surfactants or acetylene glycol-based
   surfactants.

   [0125]    [Test Example 10] Evaluation of Compositions Containing D-Tagatose and
   Multiple Types of Surfactants (Water-Soluble Powders) (Mixed Assistants)
             The effects of a formula containing D-tagatose only, formulas containing
   D-tagatose and multiple types of surfactants prepared in Example 10, and formulas
 5 containing only multiple types of surfactants on cucumber downy mildew, grape vine
   downy mildew, tomato late blight, cucumber powdery mildew, barley powdery mildew,
   wheat rust, grape vine rust, soybean rust, tomato gray mold, rice blast, cucumber
   anthracnose, apple scab, wheat speckled leaf blotch, cucumber bacterial spot and
   cabbage soft rot were evaluated using the same test method as Test Example 1. Those
10 results are shown in Table 10.
   [0126]    Protective values calculated from disease development were represented with
   the following indices (preventive value indices).    The formulas containing D-tagatose
   and assistants and formulas containing assistants only were evaluated based on the
   control effect of a 100-fold dilution (D-tagatose 0.8% + assistant, or assistant only),
15 while the formula containing D-tagatose only was evaluated based on the control effect
   of a 125-fold dilution (D-tagatose 0.8%) and a 20-fold dilution (D--tagatose 5%).
             0: Preventive value of less than 30
             1: Preventive value of 30 to less than 60
             2: Preventive value of 60 to less than 80
20           3: Preventive value of 80 to less than 90
             4: Preventive value of 90 to less than 95
             5: Preventive value of 95 to less than 98
             6: Preventive value of 98 to less than 100
             7: Preventive value of 100
25  [0127]   Although the formula containing D-tagatose only demonstrated a high control
   effect against cucumber downy mildew, grape vine downy mildew, cucumber powdery
   mildew and barley powdery mildew at a treatment concentration of 5%, those effects
   were not adequate at a treatment concentration of 0.8%.     In addition, although this
   formula also demonstrated effects against tomato late blight, wheat rust, grape vine rust,
30  soybean rust, tomato gray mold, rice blast, cucumber anthracnose, apple scab and wheat
    speckled leaf blotch at a treatment concentration of 5%, those effects were not adequate.
    [0128]   Remarkable improvement in control effects against fungal diseases such as
    cucumber downy mildew, grape vine downy mildew, tomato late blight, cucumber
   powdery mildew, barley powdery mildew, wheat scab, grape vine rust, soybean rust,
35 tomato gray mold, rice blast, cucumber anthracnose, apple scab or wheat speckled leaf
   blotch was observed with formulas containing as assistants anionic surfactants selected

                                            -51
  from aryl sulfonates, formalin condensates of aiyl sulfonates and alkyl sulfates with
  respect to the formula containing D-tagatose only.    Moreover, high control effects
  were also demonstrated against bacterial diseases such as cucumber bacterial wilt or
  cabbage soft rot, for which the formula containing D-tagatose only cannot be expected
5 to demonstrate control effects.   On the other hand, effects were not demonstrated
  against any of the diseases by the formulas containing assistants only.

              The effects of the D-tagatose water-soluble powders containing anionic
  5  surfactant prepared in Example 11 on grass red blight were evaluated.       Test plants
     (grass variety: Bentgrass) were planted, and three weeks later, cut to a height of 1 cm
    prior to use in the test.  In the test, after inoculating the seedlings with Pythiun
     aphanidermatwnpreliminarily cultured in wheat bran medium, dilutions obtained by
     diluting each formula 100-fold with well water were used to treat soil by irrigating at 3
 10 L/m2 (treatment concentrations: D-tagatose 0.8% + assistant 0.2%). After
    investigating the onset of disease five days after inoculation, control values were
    calculated from the diseased area. Effects were evaluated using the same evaluation
    method as Test Example 10.       Those results are shown in Table H1-1.
     [0131]   Although all of the test assistants alone demonstrated hardly any control effects
 15 against bentgrass red blight, each of the formulas containing D-tagatose and anionic
    surfactant selected from aryl sulfbnates, alkyl sulfates and sulfosuccinates demonstrated
    remarkable improvement in control effects in comparison with a formula containing
    D-tagatose only.
    [0132]    (Cabbage Damping-off)
20            The effects of the D-tagatose water-soluble powders containing anionic
    surfactant prepared in Example 11 on cabbage fruit rot were evaluated. Test soil was
    inoculated by contacting with Pythiurn ultimium preliminarily cultured in wheat bran
    medium followed by planting the test plants (cabbage variety: Shikidori) therein.        The
                                             2
    soil was treated by irrigating at 3 L/m with the formulations which had been 80-fold
25  diluted with well water (treatment concentrations: D-tagatose 1% + assistant 0.25%).
    14 days after inoculation, protective values were calculated from the diseased seedling
    ratio by defining those seedlings that failed to sprout or exhibited damping-off of the
    seedling following germination as diseased seedlings.        Effects were evaluated using
    the same evaluation method as Test Example 1.          Those results are shown in Table 11-2.
30  The protective value with respect to cabbage damping-off of a formula containing
    D-tagatose only was 29.9.
    [0133]    All of the formulas containing D-tagatose and an anionic surfactant selected
    from aryl sulfonates, formalin condensates of aryl sulfonates, alkyl sulfates,
    polycarboxylates and sulfosuccinates demonstrated remarkable improvement in control
35  effects against cabbage damping-off in comparison with the formula containing
    D-tagatose only.

    [0135] [Test Example 12] Evaluation of Compositions Containing D-Tagatose, Sugar,
   Amino Acid, Salt and Multiple Types of Surfactants (Liquid Preparations) (Mixed
   Assistants)
             Enhancement of the efficacy of 1) a formula containing D-tagatose only, 2) a
 5 formula containing D-tagatose and a sugar, amino acid or salt (Assistant 1), 3) a
   formula containing D-tagatose, and a sugar, amino acid or salt (Assistant 1), and an
   anionic surfactant selected from aryl sulfonates, formalin condensates of aiyl sulfonates
   and alkyl sulfates (Assistant 2), 4) a formula not containing D-tagatose and containing
   only an anionic surfactant selected from aryl sulfonates, formalin condensates of aryl
10 sulfonates and alkyl sulfates (Assistant 2), and 5) a formula containing D-tagatose and
   an anionic surfactant selected from aryl sulfonates, formalin condensates of aryl
   sulfonates and alkyl sulfates prepared in Example 12 against cucumber downy mildew,
   grape vine downy mildew and cucumber powdery mildew was evaluated using the same
   evaluation method as Test Example 10 based on the control value of a 10-fold dilution
15 (treatment concentrations: D-tagatose 0.5% + Assistant 1 0.5%, D-tagatose 0.5% +
   Assistant 1 0.5% + Assistant 2: aryl sulfonate 0.0016%, formalin condensate of aryl
   sulfonate 0.03%, alkyl sulfate 0.03%). Those results are shown in Table 12.
   [0136] Improvement of control effects against cucumber downy mildew, grape vine
   downy mildew and cucumber powdery mildew was observed with formulas containing
20 as Assistant 1 a specific sugar (monosaccharide, disaccharide, trisaccharide,
   monosaccharide alcohol, disaccharide alcohol, or amino sugar), an amino acid or a salt
   (sodium salt, potassium salt, calcium salt, magnesium salt or ammonium salt) with
   respect to the formula containing D-tagatose only. Moreover, remarkable
   improvement of control effects was observed by adding a trace amount of Assistant 2 in
25 the form of an anionic surfactant selected from aryl sulfonates, formalin condensates of
   aryl sulfonates and alkyl sulfates to D-tagatose and Assistant I selected from a specific
   sugar (monosaccharide, disaccharide, trisaccharide, monosaccharide alcohol,
   disaccharide alcohol or amino sugar), amino acid and salt. The degree of that
   improvement was more remarkable in comparison with having added Assistant 2 to the
30 formula containing D-tagatose only, and the use of both Assistant I and Assistant 2 was
   found to remarkably enhance the disease control effects of D-tagatose. On the other
   hand, hardly any effects were demonstrated against each of the diseases by the formula
   containing Assistant 2 only.

   selected from D-fructose, D-glucose, D-galactose, D-mannose, D-talose, D-sorbose,
 5 D-psicose and lactose, 2) a formula containing D-tagatose at 20% or 60% and an
   anionic surfactant selected from aryl sulfonates, formalin condensates of aryl sulfonates
   and alkyl sulfates at 0.25%, 5% and 5%, respectively, in addition to a sugar selected
   from D-fructose, D-glucose, D-galactose, D-mannose, D-talose, D-sorbose, D-psicose
   and lactose, 3) a formula containing an anionic surfactant selected from aryl sulfonates,
10 foirmalin condensates of aryl sulfonates and alkyl sulfates at 0.25%, 5% and 5%,
   respectively, and 4) a formula containing D-tagatose at 20%, 60% or 80% prepared in
   Example 13 against cucumber downy mildew, grape vine downy mildew, cucumber
   powdery mildew and wheat rust were evaluated using the same evaluation method as
   Test Example 10.     Those results are shown in Table 13.    Improvement of efficacy
15 against cucumber downy mildew, grape vine downy mildew, cucumber powdery
   mildew and wheat rust was evaluated based on the control effect of a 200-fold dilution
   (treatment concentrations: D-tagatose 0.1% to 0.4%, Assistant 0.00125% to 0.025%),
   while efficacy against wheat rust was evaluated based on the control effect of a 100-fold
   dilution (treatment concentrations: D-tagatose 0.8%, Assistant 0.0025% to 0.05%).
20 [0139]    Formulas containing D-tagatose at 20% or 60% and a sugar selected from
   D-fructose, D-glucose, D-galactose, D-mannose, D-talose, D-sorbose, D-psicose and
   lactose demonstrated high control effects in the same manner as formulas containing
   D-tagatose at 80%.     Remarkable improvement in control effects was observed by
   adding a trace amount of an assistant in the form of an anionic surfactant selected from
25 aryl sulfonates, formalin condensates of aryl sulfonates and alkyl sulfates to
   compositions containing D-tagatose and each of the aforementioned sugars.       The
   degree of that improvement was more remarkable in comparison with the addition of
   various sugars to D-tagatose, and the use of an assistant was found to remarkably
   enhance disease control effects of compositions containing D-tagatose.
