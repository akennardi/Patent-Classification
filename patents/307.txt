                                       ABSTRACT
In some embodiments, a first electronic device, during a playlist mode, displays a
plurality of representations of content items available on the first electronic device.
While in the playlist mode, the first electronic device optionally receives a first input,
via one or more input devices, selecting a respective representation of a respective
content item from the plurality of representations of content items. In response to
receiving the first input, in accordance with a determination that the respective content
item was playing on the first electronic device when the first input was received, the
first electronic device optionally transitions to a now playing mode. In accordance
with a determination that the respective content item was not playing on the first
electronic device when the first input was received, the first electronic device
optionally plays the respective content item on the first electronic device while
remaining in the playlist mode.

[0001]          This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application
No. 62/215,567, filed September 8, 2015, and U.S. Patent Application No.

                                 Field of the Disclosure
[0002]          This relates generally to electronic devices that allow for navigating
and playing content, and user interactions with such devices.
                             Background of the Disclosure
[0003]          User interaction with electronic devices has increased significantly in
recent years. These devices can be devices such as computers, tablet computers,
televisions, multimedia devices, mobile devices, and the like.
[0004]          In some circumstances, such a device has access to content (e.g.,
music, movies, etc.), and user interaction with such a device entails navigation and
playing of the content. Enhancing these interactions improves the user's experience
with the device and decreases user interaction time, which is particularly important
where input devices are battery-operated.

                                   Detailed Description
[0016]          In the following description of embodiments, reference is made to the
accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which it is shown by way of
illustration specific embodiments that are optionally practiced. It is to be understood
that other embodiments are optionally used and structural changes are optionally
made without departing from the scope of the disclosed embodiments.
                                EXEMPLARY DEVICES
[00171          Embodiments of electronic devices, user interfaces for such devices,
and associated processes for using such devices are described. In some embodiments,
the device is a portable communications device, such as a mobile telephone, that also
contains other functions, such as PDA and/or music player functions. Exemplary
embodiments of portable multifunction devices include, without limitation, the
iPhone@, iPod Touch®, and iPad@ devices from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California.
Other portable electronic devices, such as laptops or tablet computers with touch
sensitive surfaces (e.g., touch screen displays and/or touch pads), are, optionally,
used. It should also be understood that, in some embodiments, the device is not a
portable communications device, but is a desktop computer or a television with a
touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch screen display and/or a touch pad). In some
embodiments, the device does not have a touch screen display and/or a touch pad, but
rather is capable of outputting display information (such as the user interfaces of the
disclosure) for display on a separate display device, and capable of receiving input
information from a separate input device having one or more input mechanisms (such
as one or more buttons, a touch screen display and/or a touch pad). In some
embodiments, the device has a display, but is capable of receiving input information
from a separate input device having one or more input mechanisms (such as one or
more buttons, a touch screen display and/or a touch pad).
[0018]          In the discussion that follows, an electronic device that includes a
display and a touch-sensitive surface is described. It should be understood, however,
that the electronic device optionally includes one or more other physical user-interface
devices, such as a physical keyboard, a mouse and/or a joystick. Further, as described
above, it should be understood that the described electronic device, display and touch
                                             3

sensitive surface are optionally distributed amongst two or more devices. Therefore,
as used in this disclosure, information displayed on the electronic device or by the
electronic device is optionally used to describe information outputted by the electronic
device for display on a separate display device (touch-sensitive or not). Similarly, as
used in this disclosure, input received on the electronic device (e.g., touch input
received on a touch-sensitive surface of the electronic device) is optionally used to
describe input received on a separate input device, from which the electronic device
receives input information.
[0019]          The device typically supports a variety of applications, such as one or
more of the following: a drawing application, a presentation application, a word
processing application, a website creation application, a disk authoring application, a
spreadsheet application, a gaming application, a telephone application, a video
conferencing application, an e-mail application, an instant messaging application, a
workout support application, a photo management application, a digital camera
application, a digital video camera application, a web browsing application, a digital
music player application, a television channel browsing application, and/or a digital
video player application.
[0020]          The various applications that are executed on the device optionally use
at least one common physical user-interface device, such as the touch-sensitive
surface. One or more functions of the touch-sensitive surface as well as
corresponding information displayed on the device are, optionally, adjusted and/or
varied from one application to the next and/or within a respective application. In this
way, a common physical architecture (such as the touch-sensitive surface) of the
device optionally supports the variety of applications with user interfaces that are
intuitive and transparent to the user.
[0021]          Attention is now directed toward embodiments of portable or non
portable devices with touch-sensitive displays, though the devices need not include
touch-sensitive displays or displays in general, as described above. Fig. 1A is a block
diagram illustrating portable or non-portable multifunction device 100 with touch
sensitive displays 112 in accordance with some embodiments. Touch-sensitive
display 112 is sometimes called a "touch screen" for convenience, and is sometimes
known as or called a touch-sensitive display system. Device 100 includes memory
102 (which optionally includes one or more computer readable storage mediums),
                                             4

memory controller 122, one or more processing units (CPU's) 120, peripherals
interface 118, RF circuitry 108, audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, microphone 113,
input/output (I/O) subsystem 106, other input or control devices 116, and external port
124. Device 100 optionally includes one or more optical sensors 164. Device 100
optionally includes one or more intensity sensors 165 for detecting intensity of
contacts on device 100 (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display
system 112 of device 100). Device 100 optionally includes one or more tactile output
generators 167 for generating tactile outputs on device 100 (e.g., generating tactile
outputs on a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display system 112 of
device 100 or touchpad 355 of device 300). These components optionally
communicate over one or more communication buses or signal lines 103.
[0022]           As used in the specification and claims, the term "intensity" of a
contact on a touch-sensitive surface refers to the force or pressure (force per unit area)
of a contact (e.g., a finger contact) on the touch-sensitive surface, or to a substitute
(proxy) for the force or pressure of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface. The
intensity of a contact has a range of values that includes at least four distinct values
and more typically includes hundreds of distinct values (e.g., at least 256). Intensity
of a contact is, optionally, determined (or measured) using various approaches and
various sensors or combinations of sensors. For example, one or more force sensors
underneath or adjacent to the touch-sensitive surface are, optionally, used to measure
force at various points on the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations, force
measurements from multiple force sensors are combined (e.g., a weighted average) to
determine an estimated force of a contact. Similarly, a pressure-sensitive tip of a
stylus is, optionally, used to determine a pressure of the stylus on the touch-sensitive
surface. Alternatively, the size of the contact area detected on the touch-sensitive
surface and/or changes thereto, the capacitance of the touch-sensitive surface
proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto, and/or the resistance of the touch
sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto are, optionally, used
as a substitute for the force or pressure of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface.
In some implementations, the substitute measurements for contact force or pressure
are used directly to determine whether an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g.,
the intensity threshold is described in units corresponding to the substitute
measurements). In some implementations, the substitute measurements for contact
                                              5

force or pressure are converted to an estimated force or pressure and the estimated
force or pressure is used to determine whether an intensity threshold has been
exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is a pressure threshold measured in units of
pressure).
[00231           As used in the specification and claims, the term "tactile output" refers
to physical displacement of a device relative to a previous position of the device,
physical displacement of a component (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) of a device
relative to another component (e.g., housing) of the device, or displacement of the
component relative to a center of mass of the device that will be detected by a user
with the user's sense of touch. For example, in situations where the device or the
component of the device is in contact with a surface of a user that is sensitive to touch
(e.g., a finger, palm, or other part of a user's hand), the tactile output generated by the
physical displacement will be interpreted by the user as a tactile sensation
corresponding to a perceived change in physical characteristics of the device or the
component of the device. For example, movement of a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a
touch-sensitive display or trackpad) is, optionally, interpreted by the user as a "down
click" or "up click" of a physical actuator button. In some cases, a user will feel a
tactile sensation such as an "down click" or "up click" even when there is no
movement of a physical actuator button associated with the touch-sensitive surface
that is physically pressed (e.g., displaced) by the user's movements. As another
example, movement of the touch-sensitive surface is, optionally, interpreted or sensed
by the user as "roughness" of the touch-sensitive surface, even when there is no
change in smoothness of the touch-sensitive surface. While such interpretations of
touch by a user will be subject to the individualized sensory perceptions of the user,
there are many sensory perceptions of touch that are common to a large majority of
users. Thus, when a tactile output is described as corresponding to a particular
sensory perception of a user (e.g., an "up click," a "down click," "roughness"), unless
otherwise stated, the generated tactile output corresponds to physical displacement of
the device or a component thereof that will generate the described sensory perception
for a typical (or average) user.
[0024]           It should be appreciated that device 100 is only one example of a
portable or non-portable multifunction device, and that device 100 optionally has
more or fewer components than shown, optionally combines two or more
                                               6

components, or optionally has a different configuration or arrangement of the
components. The various components shown in Fig. 1A are implemented in
hardware, software, or a combination of both hardware and software, including one or
more signal processing and/or application specific integrated circuits. Further, the
various components shown in Fig. 1A are optionally implemented across two or more
devices; for example, a display and audio circuitry on a display device, a touch
sensitive surface on an input device, and remaining components on device 100. In
such an embodiment, device 100 optionally communicates with the display device
and/or the input device to facilitate operation of the system, as described in the
disclosure, and the various components described herein that relate to display and/or
input remain in device 100, or are optionally included in the display and/or input
device, as appropriate.
[0025]          Memory 102 optionally includes high-speed random access memory
and optionally also includes non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk
storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid-state memory
devices. Access to memory 102 by other components of device 100, such as CPU 120
and the peripherals interface 118, is, optionally, controlled by memory controller 122.
[0026]          Peripherals interface 118 can be used to couple input and output
peripherals of the device to CPU 120 and memory 102. The one or more processors
120 run or execute various software programs and/or sets of instructions stored in
memory 102 to perform various functions for device 100 and to process data.
[00271          In some embodiments, peripherals interface 118, CPU 120, and
memory controller 122 are, optionally, implemented on a single chip, such as chip
104. In some other embodiments, they are, optionally, implemented on separate
chips.
[0028]          RF (radio frequency) circuitry 108 receives and sends RF signals, also
called electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 converts electrical signals to/from
electromagnetic signals and communicates with communications networks and other
communications devices via the electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 optionally
includes well-known circuitry for performing these functions, including but not
limited to an antenna system, an RF transceiver, one or more amplifiers, a tuner, one
or more oscillators, a digital signal processor, a CODEC chipset, a subscriber identity
                                             7

module (SIM) card, memory, and so forth. RF circuitry 108 optionally communicates
with networks, such as the Internet, also referred to as the World Wide Web (WWW),
an intranet and/or a wireless network, such as a cellular telephone network, a wireless
local area network (LAN) and/or a metropolitan area network (MAN), and other
devices by wireless communication. The wireless communication optionally uses any
of a plurality of communications standards, protocols and technologies, including but
not limited to Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Enhanced Data
GSM Environment (EDGE), high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), high
speed uplink packet access (HSUPA), Evolution, Data-Only (EV-DO), HSPA,
HSPA+, Dual-Cell HSPA (DC-HSPDA), long term evolution (LTE), near field
communication (NFC), wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA), code
division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), Bluetooth,
Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) (e.g., IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b, IEEE 802.11g and/or
IEEE 802.1 In), voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Wi-MAX, a protocol for e-mail
(e.g., Internet message access protocol (IMAP) and/or post office protocol (POP)),
instant messaging (e.g., extensible messaging and presence protocol (XMPP), Session
Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions
(SIMPLE), Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), and/or Short Message
Service (SMS), or any other suitable communication protocol, including
communication protocols not yet developed as of the filing date of this document.
[0029]           Audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, and microphone 113 provide an
audio interface between a user and device 100. Audio circuitry 110 receives audio
data from peripherals interface 118, converts the audio data to an electrical signal, and
transmits the electrical signal to speaker 111. Speaker 111 converts the electrical
signal to human-audible sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 also receives electrical
signals converted by microphone 113 from sound waves. Audio circuitry 110
converts the electrical signal to audio data and transmits the audio data to peripherals
interface 118 for processing. Audio data is, optionally, retrieved from and/or
transmitted to memory 102 and/or RF circuitry 108 by peripherals interface 118. In
some embodiments, audio circuitry 110 also includes a headset jack (e.g., 212, Fig. 2).
The headset jack provides an interface between audio circuitry 110 and removable
audio input/output peripherals, such as output-only headphones or a headset with both
output (e.g., a headphone for one or both ears) and input (e.g., a microphone).
                                             8

[00301          I/O subsystem 106 couples input/output peripherals on device 100,
such as touch screen 112 and other input control devices 116, to peripherals interface
118. I/O subsystem 106 optionally includes display controller 156, optical sensor
controller 158, intensity sensor controller 159, haptic feedback controller 161 and one
or more input controllers 160 for other input or control devices. The one or more
input controllers 160 receive/send electrical signals from/to other input or control
devices 116. The other input control devices 116 optionally include physical buttons
(e.g., push buttons, rocker buttons, etc.), dials, slider switches, joysticks, click wheels,
and so forth. In some alternate embodiments, input controller(s) 160 are, optionally,
coupled to any (or none) of the following: a keyboard, infrared port, USB port, and a
pointer device such as a mouse. The one or more buttons (e.g., 208, Fig. 2) optionally
include an up/down button for volume control of speaker 111 and/or microphone 113.
The one or more buttons optionally include a push button (e.g., 206, Fig. 2).
[0031]          Touch-sensitive display 112 provides an input interface and an output
interface between the device and a user. As described above, the touch-sensitive
operation and the display operation of touch-sensitive display 112 are optionally
separated from each other, such that a display device is used for display purposes and
a touch-sensitive surface (whether display or not) is used for input detection purposes,
and the described components and functions are modified accordingly. However, for
simplicity, the following description is provided with reference to a touch-sensitive
display. Display controller 156 receives and/or sends electrical signals from/to touch
screen 112. Touch screen 112 displays visual output to the user. The visual output
optionally includes graphics, text, icons, video, and any combination thereof
(collectively termed "graphics"). In some embodiments, some or all of the visual
output corresponds to user-interface objects.
[0032]          Touch screen 112 has a touch-sensitive surface, sensor or set of sensors
that accepts input from the user based on haptic and/or tactile contact. Touch screen
112 and display controller 156 (along with any associated modules and/or sets of
instructions in memory 102) detect contact (and any movement or breaking of the
contact) on touch screen 112 and converts the detected contact into interaction with
user-interface objects (e.g., one or more soft keys, icons, web pages or images) that
are displayed on touch screen 112. In an exemplary embodiment, a point of contact
between touch screen 112 and the user corresponds to a finger of the user.
                                              9

[00331           Touch screen 112 optionally uses LCD (liquid crystal display)
technology, LPD (light emitting polymer display) technology, or LED (light emitting
diode) technology, although other display technologies are used in other
embodiments. Touch screen 112 and display controller 156 optionally detect contact
and any movement or breaking thereof using any of a plurality of touch sensing
technologies now known or later developed, including but not limited to capacitive,
resistive, infrared, and surface acoustic wave technologies, as well as other proximity
sensor arrays or other elements for determining one or more points of contact with
touch screen 112. In an exemplary embodiment, projected mutual capacitance
sensing technology is used, such as that found in the iPhone@, iPod Touch®, and
iPad@ from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California.
[0034]           Touch screen 112 optionally has a video resolution in excess of 100
dpi. In some embodiments, the touch screen has a video resolution of approximately
160 dpi. The user optionally makes contact with touch screen 112 using any suitable
object or appendage, such as a stylus, a finger, and so forth. In some embodiments,
the user interface is designed to work primarily with finger-based contacts and
gestures, which can be less precise than stylus-based input due to the larger area of
contact of a finger on the touch screen. In some embodiments, the device translates
the rough finger-based input into a precise pointer/cursor position or command for
performing the actions desired by the user.
[0035]           In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, device 100
optionally includes a touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular
functions. In some embodiments, the touchpad is a touch-sensitive area of the device
that, unlike the touch screen, does not display visual output. The touchpad is,
optionally, a touch-sensitive surface that is separate from touch screen 112 or an
extension of the touch-sensitive surface formed by the touch screen.
[0036]           Device 100 also includes power system 162 for powering the various

[00371          Device 100 optionally also includes one or more optical sensors 164.
Fig. 1A shows an optical sensor coupled to optical sensor controller 158 in I/O
subsystem 106. Optical sensor 164 optionally includes charge-coupled device (CCD)
or complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) phototransistors. Optical
sensor 164 receives light from the environment, projected through one or more lens,
and converts the light to data representing an image. In conjunction with imaging
module 143 (also called a camera module), optical sensor 164 optionally captures still
images or video. In some embodiments, an optical sensor is located on the back of
device 100, opposite touch screen display 112 on the front of the device, so that the
touch screen display is enabled for use as a viewfinder for still and/or video image
acquisition. In some embodiments, another optical sensor is located on the front of
the device so that the user's image is, optionally, obtained for videoconferencing while
the user views the other video conference participants on the touch screen display.
[0038]          Device 100 optionally also includes one or more contact intensity
sensors 165. Fig. 1A shows a contact intensity sensor coupled to intensity sensor
controller 159 in I/O subsystem 106. Contact intensity sensor 165 optionally includes
one or more piezoresistive strain gauges, capacitive force sensors, electric force
sensors, piezoelectric force sensors, optical force sensors, capacitive touch-sensitive
surfaces, or other intensity sensors (e.g., sensors used to measure the force (or
pressure) of a contact on a touch-sensitive surface). Contact intensity sensor 165
receives contact intensity information (e.g., pressure information or a proxy for
pressure information) from the environment. In some embodiments, at least one
contact intensity sensor is collocated with, or proximate to, a touch-sensitive surface
(e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112). In some embodiments, at least one contact
intensity sensor is located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display
112 which is located on the front of device 100.
[0039]          Device 100 optionally also includes one or more proximity sensors
166. Fig. 1A shows proximity sensor 166 coupled to peripherals interface 118.
Alternately, proximity sensor 166 is coupled to input controller 160 in I/O subsystem
106. In some embodiments, the proximity sensor turns off and disables touch screen
112 when the multifunction device is placed near the user's ear (e.g., when the user is
making a phone call).
                                             11

[00401           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more tactile output
generators 167. Fig. 1A shows a tactile output generator coupled to haptic feedback
controller 161 in I/O subsystem 106. Tactile output generator 167 optionally includes
one or more electroacoustic devices such as speakers or other audio components
and/or electromechanical devices that convert energy into linear motion such as a
motor, solenoid, electroactive polymer, piezoelectric actuator, electrostatic actuator,
or other tactile output generating component (e.g., a component that converts
electrical signals into tactile outputs on the device). Contact intensity sensor 165
receives tactile feedback generation instructions from haptic feedback module 133
and generates tactile outputs on device 100 that are capable of being sensed by a user
of device 100. In some embodiments, at least one tactile output generator is
collocated with, or proximate to, a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touch-sensitive
display system 112) and, optionally, generates a tactile output by moving the touch
sensitive surface vertically (e.g., in/out of a surface of device 100) or laterally (e.g.,
back and forth in the same plane as a surface of device 100). In some embodiments,
at least one tactile output generator sensor is located on the back of device 100,
opposite touch screen display 112 which is located on the front of device 100.
[0041]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more accelerometers 168.
Fig. 1A shows accelerometer 168 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately,
accelerometer 168 is, optionally, coupled to an input controller 160 in I/O subsystem
106. In some embodiments, information is displayed on the touch screen display in a
portrait view or a landscape view based on an analysis of data received from the one
or more accelerometers. Device 100 optionally includes, in addition to
accelerometer(s) 168, a magnetometer (not shown) and a GPS (or GLONASS or other
global navigation system) receiver (not shown) for obtaining information concerning
the location and orientation (e.g., portrait or landscape) of device 100.
[0042]           In some embodiments, the software components stored in memory 102
include operating system 126, communication module (or set of instructions) 128,
contact/motion module (or set of instructions) 130, graphics module (or set of
instructions) 132, text input module (or set of instructions) 134, Global Positioning
System (GPS) module (or set of instructions) 135, and applications (or sets of
instructions) 136. Furthermore, in some embodiments memory 102 stores
device/global internal state 157, as shown in Figs. 1A and 3. Device/global internal
                                              12

state 157 includes one or more of: active application state, indicating which
applications, if any, are currently active; display state, indicating what applications,
views or other information occupy various regions of touch screen display 112; sensor
state, including information obtained from the device's various sensors and input
control devices 116; and location information concerning the device's location and/or
attitude.
[0043]          Operating system 126 (e.g., Darwin, RTXC, LINUX, UNIX, OS X,
WINDOWS, or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks) includes various
software components and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system
tasks (e.g., memory management, storage device control, power management, etc.)
and facilitates communication between various hardware and software components.
[0044]          Communication module 128 facilitates communication with other
devices over one or more external ports 124 and also includes various software
components for handling data received by RF circuitry 108 and/or external port 124.
External port 124 (e.g., Universal Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for
coupling directly to other devices or indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet,
wireless LAN, etc.). In some embodiments, the external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 30
pin) connector that is the same as, or similar to and/or compatible with the 30-pin
connector used on iPod (trademark of Apple Inc.) devices.
[0045]          Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects contact with touch
screen 112 (in conjunction with display controller 156) and other touch-sensitive
devices (e.g., a touchpad or physical click wheel). Contact/motion module 130
includes various software components for performing various operations related to
detection of contact, such as determining if contact has occurred (e.g., detecting a
finger-down event), determining an intensity of the contact (e.g., the force or pressure
of the contact or a substitute for the force or pressure of the contact) determining if
there is movement of the contact and tracking the movement across the touch
sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more finger-dragging events), and determining
if the contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a finger-up event or a break in contact).
Contact/motion module 130 receives contact data from the touch-sensitive surface.
Determining movement of the point of contact, which is represented by a series of
contact data, optionally includes determining speed (magnitude), velocity (magnitude
and direction), and/or an acceleration (a change in magnitude and/or direction) of the
                                             13

point of contact. These operations are, optionally, applied to single contacts (e.g., one
finger contacts) or to multiple simultaneous contacts (e.g., "multitouch"/multiple
finger contacts). In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 and display
controller 156 detect contact on a touchpad.
[0046]           In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 uses a set of one or
more intensity thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a
user (e.g., to determine whether a user has "clicked" on an icon). In some
embodiments at least a subset of the intensity thresholds are determined in accordance
with software parameters (e.g., the intensity thresholds are not determined by the
activation thresholds of particular physical actuators and can be adjusted without
changing the physical hardware of device 100). For example, a mouse "click"
threshold of a trackpad or touch screen display can be set to any of a large range of
predefined thresholds values without changing the trackpad or touch screen display
hardware. Additionally, in some implementations a user of the device is provided
with software settings for adjusting one or more of the set of intensity thresholds (e.g.,
by adjusting individual intensity thresholds and/or by adjusting a plurality of intensity
thresholds at once with a system-level click "intensity" parameter).
[00471           Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects a gesture input by a
user. Different gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns
and intensities. Thus, a gesture is, optionally, detected by detecting a particular
contact pattern. For example, detecting a finger tap gesture includes detecting a
finger-down event followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off) event at the same
position (or substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g., at the
position of an icon). As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the
touch-sensitive surface includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting
one or more finger-dragging events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger
up (lift off) event.
[0048]           Graphics module 132 includes various known software components for
rendering and displaying graphics on touch screen 112 or other display, including
components for changing the visual impact (e.g., brightness, transparency, saturation,
contrast or other visual property) of graphics that are displayed. As used herein, the
term "graphics" includes any object that can be displayed to a user, including without
                                            14

limitation text, web pages, icons (such as user-interface objects including soft keys),
digital images, videos, animations and the like.
[0049]           In some embodiments, graphics module 132 stores data representing
graphics to be used. Each graphic is, optionally, assigned a corresponding code.
Graphics module 132 receives, from applications etc., one or more codes specifying
graphics to be displayed along with, if necessary, coordinate data and other graphic
property data, and then generates screen image data to output to display controller
156.
[0050]           Haptic feedback module 133 includes various software components for
generating instructions used by tactile output generator(s) 167 to produce tactile
outputs at one or more locations on device 100 in response to user interactions with
device 100.

module 132, provides soft keyboards for entering text in various applications (e.g.,
contacts 137, e-mail 140, IM 141, browser 147, and any other application that needs
text input).
[0052]           GPS module 135 determines the location of the device and provides
this information for use in various applications (e.g., to telephone 138 for use in
location-based dialing, to camera 143 as picture/video metadata, and to applications
that provide location-based services such as weather widgets, local yellow page
widgets, and map/navigation widgets).

[0072]           Each of the above identified modules and applications correspond to a
set of executable instructions for performing one or more functions described above
and the methods described in this application (e.g., the computer-implemented
methods and other information processing methods described herein). These modules
(e.g., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as separate software programs,
procedures or modules, and thus various subsets of these modules are, optionally,
combined or otherwise re-arranged in various embodiments. In some embodiments,
memory 102 optionally stores a subset of the modules and data structures identified
above. Furthermore, memory 102 optionally stores additional modules and data
structures not described above.
[0073]           In some embodiments, device 100 is a device where operation of a
predefined set of functions on the device is performed exclusively through a touch
screen and/or a touchpad (whether included in device 100 or on a separate device,
such as an input device). By using a touch screen and/or a touchpad as the primary
                                            20

input control device for operation of device 100, the number of physical input control
devices (such as push buttons, dials, and the like) on device 100 is, optionally,
reduced.
[0074]          The predefined set of functions that are performed exclusively through
a touch screen and/or a touchpad optionally include navigation between user
interfaces. In some embodiments, the touchpad, when touched by the user, navigates
device 100 to a main, home, or root menu from any user interface that is displayed on

and a respective application 136-1 (e.g., any of the aforementioned applications 137
151, 155, 380-390).
[0076]          Event sorter 170 receives event information and determines the
application 136-1 and application view 191 of application 136-1 to which to deliver
the event information. Event sorter 170 includes event monitor 171 and event
dispatcher module 174. In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes application
internal state 192, which indicates the current application view(s) displayed on touch
sensitive display 112 when the application is active or executing. In some
embodiments, device/global internal state 157 is used by event sorter 170 to determine
which application(s) is (are) currently active, and application internal state 192 is used
by event sorter 170 to determine application views 191 to which to deliver event
information.
[00771          In some embodiments, application internal state 192 includes
additional information, such as one or more of: resume information to be used when
application 136-1 resumes execution, user interface state information that indicates
information being displayed or that is ready for display by application 136-1, a state
queue for enabling the user to go back to a prior state or view of application 136-1,
and a redo/undo queue of previous actions taken by the user.
                                            21

[00781          Event monitor 171 receives event information from peripherals
interface 118. Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user
touch on touch-sensitive display 112, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals
interface 118 transmits information it receives from 1/0 subsystem 106 or a sensor,
such as proximity sensor 166, accelerometer(s) 168, and/or microphone 113 (through
audio circuitry 110). Information that peripherals interface 118 receives from I/O
subsystem 106 includes information from touch-sensitive display 112 or a touch
sensitive surface.
[00791          In some embodiments, event monitor 171 sends requests to the
peripherals interface 118 at predetermined intervals. In response, peripherals
interface 118 transmits event information. In other embodiments, peripheral interface
118 transmits event information only when there is a significant event (e.g., receiving
an input above a predetermined noise threshold and/or for more than a predetermined
duration).
[00801          In some embodiments, event sorter 170 also includes a hit view
determination module 172 and/or an active event recognizer determination module
173.
[00811          Hit view determination module 172 provides software procedures for
determining where a sub-event has taken place within one or more views, when
touch-sensitive display 112 displays more than one view. Views are made up of
controls and other elements that a user can see on the display.
[0082]          Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a
set of views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in
which information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application
views (of a respective application) in which a touch is detected optionally correspond
to programmatic levels within a programmatic or view hierarchy of the application.
For example, the lowest level view in which a touch is detected is, optionally, called
the hit view, and the set of events that are recognized as proper inputs are, optionally,
determined based, at least in part, on the hit view of the initial touch that begins a
touch-based gesture.
[00831          Hit view determination module 172 receives information related to
sub-events of a touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views
                                             22

organized in a hierarchy, hit view determination module 172 identifies a hit view as
the lowest view in the hierarchy which should handle the sub-event. In most
circumstances, the hit view is the lowest level view in which an initiating sub-event
occurs (e.g., the first sub-event in the sequence of sub-events that form an event or
potential event). Once the hit view is identified by the hit view determination module,
the hit view typically receives all sub-events related to the same touch or input source
for which it was identified as the hit view.
[0084]          Active event recognizer determination module 173 determines which
view or views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub
events. In some embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173
determines that only the hit view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events.
In other embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines
that all views that include the physical location of a sub-event are actively involved
views, and therefore determines that all actively involved views should receive a
particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, even if touch sub-events
were entirely confined to the area associated with one particular view, views higher in
the hierarchy would still remain as actively involved views.
[00851          Event dispatcher module 174 dispatches the event information to an
event recognizer (e.g., event recognizer 180). In embodiments including active event
recognizer determination module 173, event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event
information to an event recognizer determined by active event recognizer
determination module 173. In some embodiments, event dispatcher module 174
stores in an event queue the event information, which is retrieved by a respective
event receiver module 182.
[00861          In some embodiments, operating system 126 includes event sorter 170.
Alternatively, application 136-1 includes event sorter 170. In yet other embodiments,
event sorter 170 is a stand-alone module, or a part of another module stored in
memory 102, such as contact/motion module 130.
[00871          In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes a plurality of event
handlers 190 and one or more application views 191, each of which includes
instructions for handling touch events that occur within a respective view of the
application's user interface. Each application view 191 of the application 136-1
                                             23

includes one or more event recognizers 180. Typically, a respective application view
191 includes a plurality of event recognizers 180. In other embodiments, one or more
of event recognizers 180 are part of a separate module, such as a user interface kit (not
shown) or a higher level object from which application 136-1 inherits methods and
other properties. In some embodiments, a respective event handler 190 includes one
or more of: data updater 176, object updater 177, GUI updater 178, and/or event data
179 received from event sorter 170. Event handler 190 optionally utilizes or calls data
updater 176, object updater 177 or GUI updater 178 to update the application internal
state 192. Alternatively, one or more of the application views 191 includes one or
more respective event handlers 190. Also, in some embodiments, one or more of data
updater 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a respective
application view 191.
[0088]          A respective event recognizer 180 receives event information (e.g.,
event data 179) from event sorter 170, and identifies an event from the event
information. Event recognizer 180 includes event receiver 182 and event comparator
184. In some embodiments, event recognizer 180 also includes at least a subset of:
metadata 183, and event delivery instructions 188 (which optionally include sub-event
delivery instructions).
[0089]          Event receiver 182 receives event information from event sorter 170.
The event information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or
a touch movement. Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes
additional information, such as location of the sub-event. When the sub-event
concerns motion of a touch, the event information optionally also includes speed and
direction of the sub-event. In some embodiments, events include rotation of the
device from one orientation to another (e.g., from a portrait orientation to a landscape
orientation, or vice versa), and the event information includes corresponding
information about the current orientation (also called device attitude) of the device.
[0090]          Event comparator 184 compares the event information to predefined
event or sub-event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or
sub-event, or determines or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some
embodiments, event comparator 184 includes event definitions 186. Event definitions
186 contain definitions of events (e.g., predefined sequences of sub-events), for
example, event 1 (187-1), event 2 (187-2), and others. In some embodiments, sub
                                            24

events in an event 187 include, for example, touch begin, touch end, touch movement,
touch cancellation, and multiple touching. In one example, the definition for event 1
(187-1) is a double tap on a displayed object. The double tap, for example, comprises
a first touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a first
lift-off (touch end) for a predetermined phase, a second touch (touch begin) on the
displayed object for a predetermined phase, and a second lift-off (touch end) for a
predetermined phase. In another example, the definition for event 2 (187-2) is a
dragging on a displayed object. The dragging, for example, comprises a touch (or
contact) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a movement of the touch
across touch-sensitive display 112, and lift-off of the touch (touch end). In some
embodiments, the event also includes information for one or more associated event
handlers 190.
[0091]           In some embodiments, event definition 187 includes a definition of an
event for a respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator
184 performs a hit test to determine which user-interface object is associated with a
sub-event. For example, in an application view in which three user-interface objects
are displayed on touch-sensitive display 112, when a touch is detected on touch
sensitive display 112, event comparator 184 performs a hit test to determine which of
the three user-interface objects is associated with the touch (sub-event). If each
displayed object is associated with a respective event handler 190, the event
comparator uses the result of the hit test to determine which event handler 190 should
be activated. For example, event comparator 184 selects an event handler associated
with the sub-event and the object triggering the hit test.
[0092]           In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event 187 also
includes delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has
been determined whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to
the event recognizer's event type.
[00931           When a respective event recognizer 180 determines that the series of
sub-events do not match any of the events in event definitions 186, the respective
event recognizer 180 enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state,
after which it disregards subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this
situation, other event recognizers, if any, that remain active for the hit view continue
to track and process sub-events of an ongoing touch-based gesture.
                                             25

[00941           In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 includes
metadata 183 with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the
event delivery system should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event
recognizers. In some embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties,
flags, and/or lists that indicate how event recognizers interact, or are enabled to
interact, with one another. In some embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable
properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate whether sub-events are delivered to varying
levels in the view or programmatic hierarchy.
[0095]           In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 activates
event handler 190 associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of
an event are recognized. In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180
delivers event information associated with the event to event handler 190. Activating
an event handler 190 is distinct from sending (and deferred sending) sub-events to a
respective hit view. In some embodiments, event recognizer 180 throws a flag
associated with the recognized event, and event handler 190 associated with the flag
catches the flag and performs a predefined process.
[00961           In some embodiments, event delivery instructions 188 include sub
event delivery instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without
activating an event handler. Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event
information to event handlers associated with the series of sub-events or to actively
involved views. Event handlers associated with the series of sub-events or with
actively involved views receive the event information and perform a predetermined
process.
[00971           In some embodiments, data updater 176 creates and updates data used
in application 136-1. For example, data updater 176 updates the telephone number
used in contacts module 137, or stores a video file used in video player module 145.
In some embodiments, object updater 177 creates and updates objects used in
application 136-1. For example, object updater 176 creates a new user-interface
object or updates the position of a user-interface object. GUI updater 178 updates the
GUI. For example, GUI updater 178 prepares display information and sends it to
graphics module 132 for display on a touch-sensitive display.
                                              26

[00981           In some embodiments, event handler(s) 190 includes or has access to
data updater 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178. In some embodiments,
data updater 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a single
module of a respective application 136-1 or application view 191. In other
embodiments, they are included in two or more software modules.
[0099]           It shall be understood that the foregoing discussion regarding event
handling of user touches on touch-sensitive displays and/or touchpads also applies to
other forms of user inputs to operate multifunction devices 100 with input-devices,
not all of which are initiated on touch screens. For example, mouse movement and
mouse button presses, optionally coordinated with single or multiple keyboard presses
or holds; contact movements such as taps, drags, scrolls, etc., on touch-pads; pen
stylus inputs; movement of the device; oral instructions; detected eye movements;
biometric inputs; and/or any combination thereof are optionally utilized as inputs
corresponding to sub-events which define an event to be recognized.
[00100]          Fig. 2 illustrates a portable or non-portable multifunction device 100
having a touch screen 112 in accordance with some embodiments. As stated above,
multifunction device 100 is described as having the various illustrated structures (such
as touch screen 112, speaker 111, accelerometer 168, microphone 113, etc.); however,
it is understood that these structures optionally reside on separate devices. For
example, display-related structures (e.g., display, speaker, etc.) and/or functions
optionally reside on a separate display device, input-related structures (e.g., touch
sensitive surface, microphone, accelerometer, etc.) and/or functions optionally reside
on a separate input device, and remaining structures and/or functions optionally reside
on multifunction device 100.
[00101]          The touch screen 112 optionally displays one or more graphics within
user interface (UI) 200. In this embodiment, as well as others described below, a user
is enabled to select one or more of the graphics by making a gesture on the graphics,
for example, with one or more fingers 202 (not drawn to scale in the figure) or one or
more styluses 203 (not drawn to scale in the figure). In some embodiments, selection
of one or more graphics occurs when the user breaks contact with the one or more
graphics. In some embodiments, the gesture optionally includes one or more taps, one
or more swipes (from left to right, right to left, upward and/or downward) and/or a
rolling of a finger (from right to left, left to right, upward and/or downward) that has
                                               27

made contact with device 100. In some implementations or circumstances,
inadvertent contact with a graphic does not select the graphic. For example, a swipe
gesture that sweeps over an application icon optionally does not select the
corresponding application when the gesture corresponding to selection is a tap.
[00102]         Device 100 optionally also includes one or more physical buttons, such
as "home" or menu button 204. As previously described, menu button 204 is,
optionally, used to navigate to any application 136 in a set of applications that are,
optionally executed on device 100. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the menu
button is implemented as a soft key in a GUI displayed on touch screen 112.
[00103]         In one embodiment, device 100 includes touch screen 112, menu
button 204, push button 206 for powering the device on/off and locking the device,
volume adjustment button(s) 208, Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card slot 210,
head set jack 212, and docking/charging external port 124. Push button 206 is,
optionally, used to turn the power on/off on the device by depressing the button and
holding the button in the depressed state for a predefined time interval; to lock the
device by depressing the button and releasing the button before the predefined time
interval has elapsed; and/or to unlock the device or initiate an unlock process. In an
alternative embodiment, device 100 also accepts verbal input for activation or
deactivation of some functions through microphone 113. Device 100 also, optionally,
includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165 for detecting intensity of contacts
on touch screen 112 and/or one or more tactile output generators 167 for generating
tactile outputs for a user of device 100.
[00104]         Fig. 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary multifunction device with a
display and a touch-sensitive surface in accordance with some embodiments. Device
300 need not include the display and the touch-sensitive surface, as described above,
but rather, in some embodiments, optionally communicates with the display and the
touch-sensitive surface on other devices. Additionally, device 300 need not be
portable. In some embodiments, device 300 is a laptop computer, a desktop
computer, a tablet computer, a multimedia player device (such as a television or a set
top box), a navigation device, an educational device (such as a child's learning toy), a
gaming system, or a control device (e.g., a home or industrial controller). Device 300
typically includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 310, one or more network or
other communications interfaces 360, memory 370, and one or more communication
                                           28

buses 320 for interconnecting these components. Communication buses 320
optionally include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and
controls communications between system components. Device 300 includes
input/output (I/O) interface 330 comprising display 340, which is typically a touch
screen display. I/O interface 330 also optionally includes a keyboard and/or mouse
(or other pointing device) 350 and touchpad 355, tactile output generator 357 for
generating tactile outputs on device 300 (e.g., similar to tactile output generator(s) 167
described above with reference to Fig. 1A), sensors 359 (e.g., optical, acceleration,
proximity, touch-sensitive, and/or contact intensity sensors similar to contact intensity
sensor(s) 165 described above with reference to Fig. 1A). Memory 370 includes high
speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random
access solid state memory devices; and optionally includes non-volatile memory, such
as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash
memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices. Memory 370
optionally includes one or more storage devices remotely located from CPU(s) 310.
In some embodiments, memory 370 stores programs, modules, and data structures
analogous to the programs, modules, and data structures stored in memory 102 of
portable or non-portable multifunction device 100 (Fig. 1A), or a subset thereof.
Furthermore, memory 370 optionally stores additional programs, modules, and data
structures not present in memory 102 of portable or non-portable multifunction device
100. For example, memory 370 of device 300 optionally stores drawing module 380,
presentation module 382, word processing module 384, website creation module 386,
disk authoring module 388, and/or spreadsheet module 390, while memory 102 of
portable or non-portable multifunction device 100 (Fig. 1A) optionally does not store
these modules.
[00105]         Each of the above identified elements in Fig. 3 are, optionally, stored
in one or more of the previously mentioned memory devices. Each of the above
identified modules corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a function
described above. The above identified modules or programs (e.g., sets of instructions)
need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures or modules, and
thus various subsets of these modules are, optionally, combined or otherwise re
arranged in various embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 370 optionally
stores a subset of the modules and data structures identified above. Furthermore,
                                           29

memory 370 optionally stores additional modules and data structures not described
above.
[001061          Fig. 4 illustrates an exemplary user interface on a device (e.g., device
300, Fig. 3) with a touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a tablet or touchpad 355, Fig. 3)
that is separate from the display 450 (e.g., touch screen display 112). Device 300
also, optionally, includes one or more contact intensity sensors (e.g., one or more of
sensors 357) for detecting intensity of contacts on touch-sensitive surface 451 and/or
one or more tactile output generators 359 for generating tactile outputs for a user of
device 300.
[001071          Although some of the examples which follow will be given with
reference to inputs on touch screen display 112 (where the touch sensitive surface and
the display are combined), in some embodiments, the device detects inputs on a
touch-sensitive surface that is separate from the display, as shown in Fig. 4. In some
embodiments the touch sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in Fig. 4) has a primary axis (e.g.,
452 in Fig. 4) that corresponds to a primary axis (e.g., 453 in Fig. 4) on the display
(e.g., 450). In accordance with these embodiments, the device detects contacts (e.g.,
460 and 462 in Fig. 4) with the touch-sensitive surface 451 at locations that
correspond to respective locations on the display (e.g., in Fig. 4, 460 corresponds to
468 and 462 corresponds to 470). In this way, user inputs (e.g., contacts 460 and 462,
and movements thereof) detected by the device on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g.,
451 in Fig. 4) are used by the device to manipulate the user interface on the display
(e.g., 450 in Fig. 4) of the multifunction device when the touch-sensitive surface is
separate from the display. It should be understood that similar methods are,
optionally, used for other user interfaces described herein.
[00108]          Additionally, while the following examples are given primarily with
reference to finger inputs (e.g., finger contacts, finger tap gestures, finger swipe
gestures), it should be understood that, in some embodiments, one or more of the
finger inputs are replaced with input from another input device (e.g., a mouse based
input or stylus input). For example, a swipe gesture is, optionally, replaced with a
mouse click (e.g., instead of a contact) followed by movement of the cursor along the
path of the swipe (e.g., instead of movement of the contact). As another example, a
tap gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click while the cursor is located over
the location of the tap gesture (e.g., instead of detection of the contact followed by
                                             30

ceasing to detect the contact). Similarly, when multiple user inputs are
simultaneously detected, it should be understood that multiple computer mice are,
optionally, used simultaneously, or a mouse and finger contacts are, optionally, used
simultaneously.
[00109]          As used herein, the term "focus selector" refers to an input element that
indicates a current part of a user interface with which a user is interacting. In some
implementations that include a cursor or other location marker, the cursor acts as a
"focus selector," so that when an input (e.g., a press input) is detected on a touch
sensitive surface (e.g., touchpad 355 in Fig. 3 or touch-sensitive surface 451 in Fig. 4)
while the cursor is over a particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window,
slider or other user interface element), the particular user interface element is adjusted
in accordance with the detected input. In some implementations that include a touch
screen display (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112 in Fig. 1A) that enables direct
interaction with user interface elements on the touch-screen display, a detected
contact on the touch-screen acts as a "focus selector," so that when an input (e.g., a
press input by the contact) is detected on the touch-screen display at a location of a
particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider or other user interface
element), the particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance with the
detected input. In some implementations focus is moved from one region of a user
interface to another region of the user interface without corresponding movement of a
cursor or movement of a contact on a touch-screen display (e.g., by using a tab key or
arrow keys to move focus from one button to another button); in these
implementations, the focus selector moves in accordance with movement of focus
between different regions of the user interface. Without regard to the specific form
taken by the focus selector, the focus selector is generally the user interface element
(or contact on a touch-screen display) that is controlled by the user so as to
communicate the user's intended interaction with the user interface (e.g., by
indicating, to the device, the element of the user interface with which the user is
intending to interact). For example, the location of a focus selector (e.g., a cursor, a
contact or a selection box) over a respective button while a press input is detected on
the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touchpad or touch screen) will indicate that the user
is intending to activate the respective button (as opposed to other user interface
elements shown on a display of the device).
                                             31

[00110]          In some embodiments described herein, one or more operations are
performed in response to detecting a gesture that includes a respective press input or
in response to detecting the respective press input performed with a respective contact
(or a plurality of contacts), where the respective press input is detected based at least
in part on detecting an increase in intensity of the contact (or plurality of contacts)
above a press-input intensity threshold. In some embodiments, the respective
operation is performed in response to detecting the increase in intensity of the
respective contact above the press-input intensity threshold (e.g., a "down stroke" of
the respective press input). In some embodiments, the press input includes an
increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input intensity threshold
and a subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact below the press-input intensity
threshold, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the
subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below the press-input
threshold (e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input).
[00111]          In some embodiments, the device employs intensity hysteresis to avoid
accidental inputs sometimes termed "jitter," where the device defines or selects a
hysteresis intensity threshold with a predefined relationship to the press-input
intensity threshold (e.g., the hysteresis intensity threshold is X intensity units lower
than the press-input intensity threshold or the hysteresis intensity threshold is 75%,
90% or some reasonable proportion of the press-input intensity threshold). Thus, in
some embodiments, the press input includes an increase in intensity of the respective
contact above the press-input intensity threshold and a subsequent decrease in
intensity of the contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold that corresponds to the
press-input intensity threshold, and the respective operation is performed in response
to detecting the subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below the
hysteresis intensity threshold (e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input).
Similarly, in some embodiments, the press input is detected only when the device
detects an increase in intensity of the contact from an intensity at or below the
hysteresis intensity threshold to an intensity at or above the press-input intensity
threshold and, optionally, a subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact to an
intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity, and the respective operation is performed
in response to detecting the press input (e.g., the increase in intensity of the contact or
the decrease in intensity of the contact, depending on the circumstances).
                                              32

[001121          For ease of explanation, the description of operations performed in
response to a press input associated with a press-input intensity threshold or in
response to a gesture including the press input are, optionally, triggered in response to
detecting either: an increase in intensity of a contact above the press-input intensity
threshold, an increase in intensity of a contact from an intensity below the hysteresis
intensity threshold to an intensity above the press-input intensity threshold, a decrease
in intensity of the contact below the press-input intensity threshold, and/or a decrease
in intensity of the contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold corresponding to
the press-input intensity threshold. Additionally, in examples where an operation is
described as being performed in response to detecting a decrease in intensity of a
contact below the press-input intensity threshold, the operation is, optionally,
performed in response to detecting a decrease in intensity of the contact below a
hysteresis intensity threshold corresponding to, and lower than, the press-input
intensity threshold.
[00113]          Fig. 5A illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary architecture for the
device 500 according to some embodiments of the disclosure. In the embodiment of
Fig. 5A, media content is optionally received by device 500 via network interface
502, which is optionally a wireless or wired connection. The one or more processors
504 optionally execute any number of programs stored in memory 506 or storage,
which optionally includes instructions to perform one or more of the methods and/or
processes described herein (e.g., method 700).
[00114]          In some embodiments, display controller 508 causes the various user
interfaces of the disclosure to be displayed on display 514. Further, input to device
500 is optionally provided by remote 510 via remote interface 512, which is
optionally a wireless or a wired connection. It is understood that the embodiment of
Fig. 5A is not meant to limit the features of the device of the disclosure, and that other
components to facilitate other features described in the disclosure are optionally
included in the architecture of Fig. 5A as well. In some embodiments, device 500
optionally corresponds to one or more of multifunction device 100 in Figs. 1A and 2
and device 300 in Fig. 3; network interface 502 optionally corresponds to one or more
of RF circuitry 108, external port 124, and peripherals interface 118 in Figs. 1A and 2,
and network communications interface 360 in Fig. 3; processor 504 optionally
corresponds to one or more of processor(s) 120 in Fig. 1A and CPU(s) 310 in Fig. 3;

display controller 508 optionally corresponds to one or more of display controller 156
in Fig. 1A and I/O interface 330 in Fig. 3; memory 506 optionally corresponds to one
or more of memory 102 in Fig. 1A and memory 370 in Fig. 3; remote interface 512

corresponds to one or more of touch-sensitive display system 112 in Figs. 1A and 2,
and display 340 in Fig. 3.
[00115]          Fig. 5B illustrates an exemplary structure for remote 510 according to
some embodiments of the disclosure. Remote 510 optionally includes touch-sensitive
surface 451. In some embodiments, touch-sensitive surface 451 is edge-to-edge (e.g.,
it extends to the edges of remote 510, such that little or no surface of remote 510
exists between the touch-sensitive surface 451 and one or more edges of remote 510,
as illustrated in Fig. 5B). Touch-sensitive surface 451 is optionally able to sense
contacts as well as contact intensities (e.g., clicks of touch-sensitive surface 451), as
previously described in this disclosure. Remote 510 also optionally includes buttons
516, 518, 520, 522 and 524. Buttons 516, 518, 520, 522 and 524 are optionally
mechanical buttons or mechanical button alternatives that are able to sense contact
with, or depression of, such buttons to initiate corresponding action(s) on, for
example, device 500. In some embodiments, selection of "menu" button 516 by a
user navigates device 500 backwards in a currently-executing application or currently
displayed user interface (e.g., back to a user interface that was displayed previous to
the currently-displayed user interface), or navigates device 500 to a one-higher-level
user interface than the currently-displayed user interface. In some embodiments,
selection of "home" button 518 by a user navigates device 500 to a main, home, or
root user interface from any user interface that is displayed on device 500 (e.g., to a
home screen of device 500 that optionally includes one or more applications
accessible on device 500). In some embodiments, selection of "play/pause" button
                                              34

520 by a user toggles between playing and pausing a currently-playing content item
on device 500 (e.g., if a content item is playing on device 500 when "play/pause"
button 520 is selected, the content item is optionally paused, and if a content item is
paused on device 500 when "play/pause" button 520 is selected, the content item is
optionally played). In some embodiments, selection of "+" 522 or "-" 524 buttons by
a user increases or decreases, respectively, the volume of audio reproduced by device
500 (e.g., the volume of a content item currently-playing on device 500). In addition
or alternatively to the functionalities described above, touch-sensitive surface 451 and
buttons 516, 518, 520, 522 and 524 are optionally utilized in the manners provided in
the descriptions of embodiments set forth below.
               USER INTERFACES AND ASSOCIATED PROCESSES
                             Content Navigation and Playing
[00116]          Users interact with electronic devices in many different manners,
including interacting with content (e.g., music, movies, etc.) that may be available
(e.g., stored or otherwise accessible) on the electronic devices. In some
circumstances, the users desire to navigate through content available on the electronic
devices, and/or play content available on the electronic devices. The embodiments
described below provide ways in which electronic devices allow users to navigate and
play content items available on the electronic devices, thereby enhancing users'
interactions with the electronic devices. Enhancing interactions with a device reduces
the amount of time needed by a user to perform operations, and thus reduces the
power usage of the device and increases battery life for battery-powered devices. It is
understood that people use devices. When a person uses a device, that person is
optionally referred to as a user of the device.
[001171          Figs. 6A-6Z and 6AA-6CC illustrate exemplary ways in which
electronic devices allow users to navigate and play content items available on the
electronic devices in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. The
embodiments in these figures are used to illustrate the processes described below,
including the processes described with reference to Figs. 7A-71.
[00118]          It should be noted that the examples illustrated in Figs. 6A-6Z and
6AA-6CC are directed to electronic devices that display information on non-touch
                                             35

sensitive displays, though it is understood that the electronic devices may instead
display information on displays having touch-sensitive capability (e.g., touch screens).
For example, the electronic devices may include touch screens, or the electronic
devices may be capable of outputting display information for display on separate
touch screens, as previously described in this disclosure-in such circumstances, the
displays described below optionally correspond to the touch screens mentioned above,
and the inputs described below are optionally detected on the touch screens.
[00119]          Fig. 6A illustrates exemplary display 514. Display 514 optionally
displays one or more user interfaces that include various content. In the example
illustrated in Fig. 6A, display 514 optionally displays an application for navigating
and playing content (e.g., music, movies, etc.) running on an electronic device (e.g.,
electronic device 500 of Fig. 5A) of which display 514 is a part, or to which display
514 is connected. The application is optionally in a playlist mode, and display 514
optionally displays a corresponding playlist user interface 602.
[00120]          The playlist user interface 602 optionally includes a plurality of
representations 606 of content items (e.g., music, movies, etc.) available on the
electronic device. The representations 606 optionally include album artwork or other
graphics related to the content items to which they correspond. In the embodiment of
Fig. 6A, the playlist user interface 602 optionally includes five representations of
content items available on the electronic device (representations 606-1, 606-2, 606-3,
606-4 and 606-5), and the representations optionally correspond to songs (content
items A-E) available on the electronic device. The representations 606 are optionally
displayed in a bar or line 604 along an axis in the playlist user interface 602 (e.g.,
horizontally, as in Fig. 6A). Representation 606-3 optionally has a current focus,
which is optionally reflected by representation 606-3 being larger than the remaining
representations (e.g., representations 606-1, 606-2, 606-4 and 606-5). Additional or
alternative visual characteristics are optionally implemented to indicate a
representation having the current focus (e.g., highlighting the representation, changing
the color of the representation, outlining the representation, etc.). The representation
with current focus-representation 606-3 in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 6A
optionally has description 608 displayed adjacent to the representation (e.g., below the
representation). Description 608 optionally includes information relating to the
content item with current focus-in the embodiment of Fig. 6A, description 608
                                             36

optionally includes the name of the artist ("Green Day") and the name of the song
("Longview") corresponding to the representation with current focus, though other
information, such as the name of the music album to which the content item belongs,
is optionally additionally or alternatively included in description 608
[00121]          Playlist user interface 602 also optionally includes a current-play
indicator 610, which optionally indicates which content item is currently-playing on
the electronic device. In the embodiment of Fig. 6A, the content item corresponding
to representation 606-3 (Green Day's Longview) is optionally playing on the
electronic device, and the current-play indicator 610 is optionally displayed adjacent
to representation 606-3 (e.g., below representation 606-3) to reflect this fact.
[00122]          The playlist user interface 602 optionally displays a background behind
representations 606, which optionally corresponds to the currently-playing content
item on the electronic device. In the embodiment of Fig. 6A, the background
optionally corresponds to the content item corresponding to representation 606-3 (e.g.,
background C optionally corresponds to content item C). In some embodiments, the
background in the playlist user interface 602 is a combination of two versions of
artwork for the currently-playing content item (e.g., album artwork for content item
C), the two versions of the artwork being visually manipulated (e.g., rotating and
scaling) at different rates (e.g., the combination is optionally a union of two instances
of the same artwork for the currently-playing content item, the two instances rotating
at different rates, and/or scaling larger and smaller at different rates). In some
embodiments, the artwork is the same artwork as is displayed in the representation of
the currently-playing content item (e.g., representation 606-3). Representations 606
are optionally scrollable (e.g., the representation with the current focus is optionally
changeable) in accordance with one or more inputs detected by the electronic device.
[001231          Fig. 6B illustrates scrolling of representations 606 in accordance with
an input detected by the electronic device. The electronic device optionally detects a
swipe input on touch-sensitive surface 451. Touch-sensitive surface 451 is optionally
a touch-sensitive surface on a second electronic device, such as a remote control (e.g.,
remote 510 in Figs. 5A-5B). The swipe input optionally includes contact 603 moving
from left to right in a horizontal manner, as illustrated in Fig. 6B. In response to
detecting the swipe input, representations 606 are optionally scrolled. Specifically,
representation 606-2 optionally now has the current focus (e.g., the current focus
                                              37

optionally shifts left in the representations 606 in response to a left-to-right swipe
input detected at touch-sensitive surface 451). As such, representation 606-2 is now
optionally displayed with a larger size than the remaining representations, as
illustrated in Fig. 6B. Further, in some embodiments, the representation 606 with the
current focus remains at the same location in the playlist user interface 602 (e.g., in
the center, as illustrated in Fig. 6B), and thus a swipe input detected at touch-sensitive
surface 451 optionally moves representations 606 with respect to the playlist user
interface 602 displayed on display 514. In some embodiments, such swipe inputs
detected while the electronic device is in the playlist mode optionally change the
representation 606 with the current focus, but do not change the currently-playing
content item on the electronic device. As such, current-play indicator 610 optionally
remains with representation 606-3, even though representation 606-2 optionally now
has the current focus. In some embodiments, because the background of the playlist
user interface 602 is determined by the currently-playing content item on the
electronic device, the background in Fig. 6B optionally remains unchanged with
respect to the background in Fig. 6A (e.g., background C) in response to receiving the
swipe input on touch-sensitive surface 451, because the swipe input optionally does
not change the currently-playing content item, as mentioned above, but rather
optionally merely changes the representation 606 with the current focus.
[00124]          Description 608, however, optionally does change when the current
focus changes. Specifically, description 608 optionally now includes information
related to the content item corresponding to representation 606-2 (content item B),
because representation 606-2 now optionally has the current focus. In the
embodiment of Fig. 6B, representation 606-2 optionally corresponds to Michael
Jackson's Thriller, and thus description 608 optionally includes that information.
[00125]          Fig. 6C illustrates further scrolling of representations 606 in
accordance with a further input detected by the electronic device. Specifically,
another left-to-right swipe input is optionally detected on touch-sensitive surface 451,
as illustrated in Fig. 6C. In response to the swipe input, representations 606 are
optionally further scrolled to the left, such that representation 606-1 optionally now
has the current focus. Description 608 is optionally updated again to include
information about the content item corresponding to the representation 606 with
current focus-namely, content item A corresponding to representation 606-1. The
                                              38

current-play indicator 610 optionally remains with representation 606-3, as previously
discussed.
[001261          Fig. 6D illustrates selection of a representation 606 corresponding to a
content item that is not currently playing on the electronic device. Specifically, touch
sensitive surface 451 optionally includes a plurality of predefined regions 612, such as
a top-left region 612a, a top-center region 612b, and additional such regions as
illustrated in Fig. 6D. The electronic device optionally detects a selection input at
touch-sensitive surface 451 in Fig. 6D. A selection input optionally corresponds to a
click (e.g., contact 603 having an intensity greater than an intensity threshold)
detected in center region 612e of touch-sensitive surface 451. In some embodiments,
the selection input is a tap (e.g., contact 603 having an intensity less than the intensity
threshold) in center region 612e of touch-sensitive surface 451, rather than a click. In
response to detecting the selection input at touch-sensitive surface 451, the electronic
device optionally starts to play the content item corresponding to the selected
representation 606-1-the Spice Girls' Wannabe. Current-play indicator 610 is
optionally updated to be displayed with representation 606-1, and the background of
the playlist user interface 602 is optionally also updated to correspond to content item
A (background A).
[001271          In contrast to Fig. 6D, Figs. 6E-6G illustrate selection of a
representation 606 in the playlist user interface 602 corresponding to a content item
that is currently playing on the electronic device. For example, starting at Fig. 6B,
instead of detecting input to scroll to and select representation 606-1, the electronic
device in Fig. 6E optionally detects a right-to-left swipe on touch-sensitive surface
451, as illustrated in Fig. 6E. In response, the electronic device optionally scrolls
back to representation 606-3, corresponding to content item C, which is optionally
currently-playing on the electronic device. Fig. 6E illustrates representation 606-3
having the current focus in response to the input detected on touch-sensitive surface
451.
[00128]          In Fig. 6F, the electronic device optionally detects a selection input on
touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a click or tap detected in center region 612e of
touch-sensitive surface 451) selecting representation 606-3-the representation with
the current focus. Because content item C-the content item optionally
corresponding to selected representation 606-3-is optionally currently-playing on the
                                              39

electronic device when the selection input is received, the electronic device optionally
transitions to a now playing mode in response to detecting the selection input on
touch-sensitive surface 451, as illustrated in Fig. 6G. In some embodiments, the
electronic device transitions from the now playing mode back to the playlist mode in
response to selection of "menu" button 516 on remote 510 in Fig. 5B. Further, in
some embodiments, the electronic device transitions from the playlist mode back to
the now playing mode in response to further selection of "menu" button 516 on
remote 510 in Fig. 5B.
[00129]         Fig. 6G illustrates an exemplary now playing user interface 603
displayed by the electronic device while in the now playing mode of the electronic
device. Specifically, when transitioning from the playlist mode to the now playing
mode, the electronic device optionally maintains display of the representation
corresponding to the currently-playing content item (representation 606-3,
corresponding to content item C), but ceases display of the remaining representations
(e.g., representations 606-1, 606-2, 606-4 and 606-5). In some embodiments,
description 608 continues to be displayed in the now playing user interface 603. In
this way, a user is able to easily determine which content item is playing on the
electronic device.
[00130]         Fig. 6H illustrates display of a progress bar 614 in the now playing
user interface 603. Progress bar 614 optionally indicates a current play position in the
currently-playing content item-in the embodiment of Fig. 6H, content item C
corresponding to representation 606-3. The progress bar 614 optionally includes a
current-play position indicator 616 that reflects the current-play position in the
currently-playing content item. In some embodiments, the current-play position
indicator 616 includes a time display of the current play position (e.g., 23 seconds),
and the scrubber bar 614 optionally includes a time display of a total length of the
currently-playing content item (e.g., 2 minutes and 10 seconds). In some
embodiments, the progress bar is optionally displayed in the now playing user
interface 603 in response to a determination that an input device to the electronic
device (e.g., remote 510 including touch-sensitive surface 451) has been picked up by
a user of the electronic device.
[00131]         Fig. 61 illustrates scrubbing through the currently-playing content item
while in the now playing mode of the electronic device. Specifically, a left-to-right
                                             40

swipe input has been detected on touch-sensitive surface 451, as illustrated in Fig. 61.
In response to detecting the swipe input, the electronic device optionally scrubs
through the currently-playing content item, as reflected by the movement of the
current-play position indicator 616 from 00:23 to 00:38 (a forward scrubbing of 15
seconds). In some embodiments, the amount and/or speed of scrubbing through the
currently-playing content item is dependent on the speed and/or length of the swipe
input detected on touch-sensitive surface 451. In some embodiments, while in the
now playing mode, no progress bar 614 is displayed in the now playing user interface,
and the currently-playing content item is optionally scrubbed as described above
despite the lack of progress bar 614 displayed in the now playing user interface 603
(e.g., progress bar 614 is optionally not required to scrub through the currently
playing content item while in the now playing mode of the electronic device).
[00132]          In some embodiments, the currently-playing content item is optionally
also able to be scrubbed while in the playlist mode of the electronic device. Fig. 6J
illustrates an exemplary playlist user interface 602, as previously described with
reference to Fig. 6A, for example. Fig. 6K illustrates display of a scrubber bar 615 in
the playlist user interface 602. An input has optionally been detected on touch
sensitive surface 451 that corresponds to navigation to the scrubber bar 615.
Specifically, a downward swipe input has optionally been detected on touch-sensitive
surface 451 while a representation 606 had a current focus (e.g., representation 606-3,
as illustrated in Fig. 6J). In response to the downward swipe, scrubber bar 615 is
optionally displayed in the playlist user interface 602, as illustrated in Fig. 6K, and the
scrubber bar 615 is optionally selected (e.g., representation 606-3 optionally no longer
has the current focus, as reflected by its reduction in size to match the other
representations 606). Scrubber bar 615 optionally has the same structure as progress
bar 614 described with reference to Figs. 6H-61.
[00133]          Scrubber bar 615 is optionally usable to scrub through the currently
playing content item (e.g., content item C) while the electronic device is in the playlist
mode. Fig. 6L illustrates scrubbing through the currently-playing content item using
the scrubber bar 615. While the scrubber bar 615 is selected, a left-to-right swipe
input is optionally detected on touch-sensitive surface 451. In response to detecting
the input, the currently-playing content item is optionally scrubbed forward in
accordance with the swipe input, as reflected by the change in the current-play
                                             41

position indicator 616. A right-to-left swipe detected on touch-sensitive surface 451
optionally correspondingly scrubs backwards through the currently-playing content
item.
[00134]         Fig. 6M illustrates skipping through the currently-playing content item
by a predetermined amount while in the playlist mode of the electronic device. While
the scrubber bar 615 is selected, a click input is optionally detected in center-right
region 612f of touch-sensitive surface 451. In response to detecting the click, the
electronic device optionally skips through the currently-playing content item by a
predetermined amount (e.g., 10 seconds, as illustrated in Fig. 6M). In some
embodiments, a simple click (e.g., contact 603 having an intensity greater than an
intensity threshold for less than a predetermined amount of time, such as .5 seconds)
results in skipping through the currently-playing content item by a predetermined
amount, while a click-and-hold (e.g., contact 603 having an intensity greater than the
intensity threshold for longer than the predetermined amount of time) results in
skipping through the currently-playing content items until the click is released (e.g.,
until the intensity of the contact falls below the intensity threshold). In some
embodiments, a click or click-and-hold in the center-left region 612d of touch
sensitive surface 451 causes backwards skipping through the currently-playing
content item, while a click or click-and-hold in the center-right region 612f of touch
sensitive surface 451 causes forwards skipping through the currently-playing content
item.
[001351         Figs. 6N and 60 illustrate toggling between playing and pausing the
currently-playing content item while in the playlist mode of the electronic device.
Specifically, while the scrubber bar 615 is selected, a click detected in center region
612e optionally toggles between playing and pausing the currently-playing content
item. In Fig. 6N, a click has optionally been detected in center region 612e of touch
sensitive surface 451. In response, the electronic device has optionally paused
playback of content item C-the currently-playing content item. Visual indicator 618
also optionally reflects that the currently-playing content item has been paused. In
Fig. 60, another click has optionally been detected in center region 612e of touch
sensitive surface 451. In response, the electronic device has optionally resumed
playback of content item C. Visual indicator 618 also optionally reflects that
playback of the currently-playing content item has resumed. In some embodiments,
                                             42

the currently-playing content item is playable and pausable, whether in the now
playing mode or the playlist mode of the electronic device, and whether or not
scrubber bar 615 is selected in the user interface, in response to selection of
"play/pause" button 520 in remote 510 in Fig. 5B, as previously discussed.
[00136]          In some embodiments, in response to determining that no input has
been detected for longer than a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 5, 10 or 20
seconds) at touch-sensitive surface 451, the electronic device optionally determines
that a timeout has occurred, and optionally performs specified actions in response.
For example, in Fig. 6P, the electronic device is optionally in the playlist mode.
Representation 606-1 optionally has the current focus, while content item C,
corresponding to representation 606-3, is optionally the currently-playing content
item. Optionally, no input has been detected on touch-sensitive surface 451 for longer
than a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 5, 10 or 20 seconds).
[001371          Fig. 6Q illustrates an exemplary response of the electronic device to
the above timeout determination. Specifically, because the representation
corresponding to the currently-playing content item optionally did not have the
current focus when the above timeout occurred, the electronic device optionally
updates the current focus such that the representation corresponding to the currently
playing content item has the current focus in response to the above timeout, as
illustrated in Fig. 6Q. In particular, representation 606-3 now optionally has the
current focus in response to the above timeout determination.
[00138]          In some embodiments, another timeout optionally occurs while
representation 606-3, corresponding to the currently-playing content item, has the
current focus. Specifically, the electronic device optionally determines that no input
has been detected at touch-sensitive surface 451 for longer than a predetermined
amount of time (e.g., 5, 10 or 20 seconds) while the representation corresponding to
the currently-playing content item has the current focus. In response, the electronic
device optionally transitions to the now playing mode, as illustrated in Fig. 6R.
Therefore, two different timeouts and corresponding actions are optionally
implemented by the electronic device (e.g., a timeout to cause the currently-playing
content item to have the current focus, and a timeout to transition from the playlist
mode to the now playing mode), as described with reference to Figs. 6P-6R.
                                             43

[001391          In some embodiments, the currently-playing content item is optionally
changed while in the now playing mode of the electronic device. Fig. 6S illustrates a
contact 603 detected in center-right region 612f of touch-sensitive surface 451 while
in the now playing mode of the electronic device. The now playing user interface 603
optionally includes a background corresponding to the currently-playing content item,
as previously discussed with reference to Figs. 6A-6D (e.g., background C,
corresponding to content item C, in Fig. 6S). Contact 603 is optionally a contact that
does not correspond to a click (e.g., has an intensity less than an intensity threshold
required to be a click). Because contact 603 optionally is not a click, the electronic
device optionally does not change the currently-playing content item in response to
detecting contact 603 in center-right region 612f of touch-sensitive surface 451 while
in the now playing mode. Also, as discussed above, the now playing user interface
603 optionally displays a background corresponding to the currently-playing content
item-in the embodiment of Fig. 6S, content item C. Thus, in Fig. 6S, the now
playing user interface 603 optionally includes background C, and contact 603 detected
in center-right region 612f of touch-sensitive surface 451 optionally does not change
the background of the now playing user interface 603, because the contact optionally
does not change the currently-playing content item, as discussed above.
[00140]          Fig. 6T illustrates a click detected in center-right region 612f of touch
sensitive surface 451 while in the now playing mode of the electronic device. The
click optionally corresponds to contact 603 having an intensity greater than an
intensity threshold, as previously discussed. In response to detecting the click in
center-right region 612f of touch-sensitive surface 451, the electronic device
optionally changes the currently-playing content item from content item C (in Fig. 6S)
to content item D (in Fig. 6T). In other words, a click detected in center-right region
612f of touch-sensitive surface 451 optionally results in the electronic device skipping
to the next song in the playlist. Analogously, a click detected in center-left region
612d of touch-sensitive surface 451 optionally results in the electronic device
skipping to the previous song in the playlist (e.g., content item B, in the embodiments
illustrated in the figures). In some embodiments, the electronic device optionally
displays skip indicator 620 in the now playing user interface 603 to provide a visual
indication that the currently-playing content item is being changed to the next content
item in the playlist (or, in the case of a backwards skip, the previous content item in
                                              44

the playlist). Additionally, in some embodiments, the background displayed in the
now playing user interface 603 changes along with the change in the currently-playing
content item, so that the background continues to correspond to the currently-playing
content item. In the embodiment of Fig. 6T, the background optionally changes from
background C (in Fig. 6S) to background D (in Fig. 6T).
[00141]         Fig. 6U illustrates a further click detected in center-right region 612f of
touch-sensitive surface 451 while in the now playing mode of the electronic device.
In response to the click detected in center-right region 612f of touch-sensitive surface
451, the electronic device optionally again skips forward in the playlist to content
item E, corresponding to representation 606-5. Like in Fig. 6T, skip indicator 620
optionally similarly indicates the forward skip through the playlist, and the
background is optionally similarly changed from background D (in Fig. 6T) to
background E (in Fig. 6U).
[00142]         In some embodiments, contacts or clicks detected in center-right 612f
or center-left 612d regions of touch-sensitive surface while the electronic device is in
the playlist mode optionally result in corresponding actions to be taken by the
electronic device. Fig. 6V illustrates an exemplary playlist user interface 602, as
previously described. Touch-sensitive surface 451 optionally includes a plurality of
predefined regions 612, as illustrated in Fig. 6V. In Fig. 6W, the electronic device has
optionally detected a contact 603 (e.g., a tap) in center-right region 612f of touch
sensitive surface 451. In response to the contact 603 detected in center-right region
612f of touch-sensitive surface 451, the electronic device optionally shifts the current
focus to the right by one, from representation 606-3 to 606-4, without changing the
currently-playing content item. A contact detected in center-left region 612d of
touch-sensitive surface 451 optionally analogously shifts the current focus to the left
by one. Similarly, in Fig. 6X, the electronic device has optionally detected a click in
center-right region 612f of touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., contact 603 having an
intensity greater than an intensity threshold). In response to the click detected in
center-right region 612f of touch-sensitive surface 451, the electronic device
optionally shifts the current focus to the right by one, from representation 606-4 to
606-5, without changing the currently-playing content item. A click detected in
center-left region 612d of touch-sensitive surface 451 optionally analogously shifts
the current focus to the left by one. Thus, either a tap or a click detected in center
                                             45

right region 612f or center-left region 612d of touch-sensitive surface 451 while the
electronic device is in the playlist mode optionally results in the electronic device
moving the current focus to the right or left by one, respectively, without changing the
currently-playing content item.
[00143]          In some embodiments, while in the now playing mode, if the electronic
device detects a click (or, in some embodiments, a tap) in center region 612e of touch
sensitive surface 451, the electronic device optionally transitions to the playlist mode.
Fig. 6Y illustrates the now playing user interface 603 while the electronic device is in
the now playing mode. A click has been detected in center region 612e of touch
sensitive surface 451. In response, the electronic device optionally transitions to the
playlist mode, as illustrated in Fig. 6Z.
[00144]          In some embodiments, an action menu is optionally accessible from the
playlist user interface to perform one or more actions relating to the content item with
the current focus in the user interface. Fig. 6AA illustrates an exemplary playlist user
interface 602. Representation 606-3, corresponding to content item C, optionally has
the current focus. An upward swipe is optionally detected on touch-sensitive surface
451, as illustrated in Fig. 6AA. In response, action menu indicator 622 is optionally
displayed in the playlist user interface 622 above the representation 606 with the
current focus (e.g., representation 606-3), and the representation with the current
focus optionally loses the current focus, which optionally shifts to the action menu
indicator 622, as illustrated in Fig. 6BB.
[00145]          While the action menu indicator 622 has the current focus, the
electronic device optionally detects a click in center region 612e of touch-sensitive
surface 451 to select the action menu indicator 622, as illustrated in Fig. 6BB. In
some embodiments, action menu indicator 622 is optionally directly selected from
Fig. 6AA by detection of a click in top-center region 612b of touch-sensitive surface
451, instead of detection of an upward swipe followed by a click in center region
612e. In response to the click input in center region 612e of touch-sensitive surface
451 in Fig. 6BB, the electronic device optionally displays action items 624 in an
action menu user interface 605, as illustrated in Fig. 6CC. In some embodiments, the
action items 624 are overlaid on the playlist user interface 602 illustrated in Fig. 6BB.
The action items 624 optionally include a plurality of selectable user interface
elements, each element corresponding to an action related to the content item whose
                                            46

representation 606 had the current focus when the action menu indicator 622 was
selected (content item C, in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 6AA). For example,
action items 624 optionally include navigating to an album associated with the content
item with current focus 624a, playing the content item with current focus next 624b,
adding the content item with current focus to a list of content items up next 624c,
playing a station of content items associated with the content item with current focus
624d, adding the content item with current focus to a library of content items 624e,
adding the content item with current focus to a playlist 624f, and configuring speakers
of the first electronic device 624g. In some embodiments, selection of action menu
indicator 622 in Fig. 6CC (e.g., a click detected in top-center region 612b of touch
sensitive surface 451, or navigation to the action menu indicator 622 with an upwards
swipe followed by selection of the action menu indicator 622 with a click detected in
center region 612e of touch-sensitive surface 451) causes the electronic device to
return to the playlist user interface 602 (e.g., as illustrated in Fig. 6AA).
[00146]          Figs. 7A-71 are flow diagrams illustrating a method 700 of navigating
and playing content items available on an electronic device in accordance with some
embodiments of the disclosure. The method 700 is optionally performed at an
electronic device such as device 100, device 300 or device 500 as described above
with reference to Figs. 1A-1B, 2-3 and 5. Some operations in method 700 are,
optionally, combined and/or the order of some operations is, optionally, changed.
[001471          As described below, the method 700 provides ways in which a user
interacts with a device for playing and navigating content items available on the
device. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when interacting with a
user interface (e.g., a playlist or now playing user interface) of the device of the
disclosure, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery
operated electronic devices, increasing the efficiency of the user's interaction with the
user interface conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.
[00148]          In some embodiments, a first electronic device (e.g., device 100, 300
or 500) with a display (e.g., a display device included in or coupled to the first
electronic device, such as display 514 in Fig. 5A) and one or more input devices (e.g.,
one or more input devices included in or coupled to the first electronic device; for
example, a second electronic device, such as a remote control, with a touch-sensitive
surface, such as remote 510 in Figs. 5A-5B), during a playlist mode of the first
                                             47

electronic device (e.g., such as in Fig. 6A), displays (702), on the display, a plurality
of representations of content items (e.g., music, movies, television shows, etc.)
available on the first electronic device (e.g., during the playlist mode, graphics
corresponding to the content items available on the first electronic device are
optionally displayed, such as in Fig. 6A). In some embodiments, the content items are
songs, and the representations of the songs are corresponding album artwork for those
songs. In some embodiments, the representations of the content items are displayed
along a first axis, such as horizontally, on the display (e.g., as illustrated in Fig. 6A).
In some embodiments, while in the playlist mode, the first electronic device receives
(704) a first input (e.g., a click or a tap of a touch-sensitive surface of a second
electronic device, such as illustrated in Figs. 6D and 6F), via the one or more input
devices, selecting a respective representation of a respective content item from the
plurality of representations of content items. In some embodiments, in response to
receiving the first input (706), in accordance with a determination that the respective
content item was playing on the first electronic device when the first input was
received, the first electronic device transitions (708) to a now playing mode of the
first electronic device, including: maintaining the display of the respective
representation of the respective content item on the display, and ceasing the display of
the representations of content items other than the respective representation of the
respective content item on the display (e.g., if the content item that was selected was
already playing on the first electronic device when it was selected, the first electronic
device optionally transitions to a now playing mode in which the representation of the
content item that was selected remains on the display, while the other representations
of the other content items stop being displayed on the display, such as illustrated in
Figs. 6F-6G). In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the
respective content item was not playing on the first electronic device when the first
input was received (e.g., because a different content item in the playlist was playing
instead of the respective content item), the first electronic device plays (710) the
respective content item on the first electronic device while remaining in the playlist
mode of the first electronic device (e.g., if the content item that was selected was not
already playing on the first electronic device when it was selected, the first electronic
device optionally remains in the playlist mode in which the representations of the
                                               48

content items remain on the display, and starts playing the selected content item, such
as illustrated in Figs. 6C-6D).
[00149]          After determining that the respective content item was not playing on
the first electronic device when the first input was received and while playing the
respective content item on the first electronic device in the playlist mode of the first
electronic device in response to receiving the first input, the first electronic device
optionally receives (712) a second input, via the one or more input devices, selecting
the respective representation of the respective content item (e.g., receiving a second
selection of the respective representation of the respective content item, such as a
click or a tap of a touch-sensitive surface of a second electronic device). In some
embodiments, the first electronic device, in response to receiving the second input,
transitions (714) to the now playing mode of the first electronic device, including:
maintaining (716) the display of the respective representation of the respective content
item on the display, and ceasing (718) the display of the representations of content
items other than the respective representation of the respective content item on the
display (e.g., the first electronic device optionally transitions to a now playing mode
in which the representation of the content item that was selected remains on the
display, while the other representations of the other content items stop being displayed
on the display, such as illustrated in Fig. 6G).
[00150]          In some embodiments, while the respective content item is playing on
the first electronic device (and, optionally, after receiving the first input), the first
electronic device receives (720) a second input comprising a swipe input detected at a
touch-sensitive surface of the one or more input devices (e.g., a horizontal swipe
detected on the touch-sensitive surface, such as illustrated in Figs. 6B-6C). In some
embodiments, in response to receiving the second input (722), in accordance with a
determination that the first electronic device was in the playlist mode when the second
input was received, the first electronic device scrolls (724) through the plurality of
representations of content items in accordance with the swipe input (e.g., scrolling left
through the representations of content items if the swipe is a rightward horizontal
swipe, and scrolling right through the representations of content items if the swipe is a
leftward horizontal swipe, such as illustrated in Figs. 6B-6C). In some embodiments,
in accordance with a determination that the first electronic device was in the now
playing mode when the second input was received, the first electronic device scrubs
                                             49

(726) through the respective content item in accordance with the swipe input (e.g.,
scrubbing forward through the respective content item if the swipe is a rightward
horizontal swipe, and scrubbing backward through the respective content item if the
swipe is a leftward horizontal swipe, such as illustrated in Fig. 61). Therefore, a swipe
while in the playlist mode optionally scrolls through the content items available on the
first electronic device, while a swipe in the now playing mode optionally scrubs
through the currently-playing content item on the first electronic device.
[00151]          In some embodiments, after receiving the first input and while the
respective content item is playing in the playlist mode of the first electronic device,
the first electronic device receives (728) a second input comprising a swipe input
(e.g., a horizontal swipe) detected at a touch-sensitive surface of the one or more input
devices. In some embodiments, in response to receiving the second input (730), in
accordance with a determination that the second input comprises navigation to a
scrubber bar (e.g., a downward swipe while in the playlist mode that gives a scrubber
bar a current focus, such as illustrated in Fig. 6K) before the swipe input, the first
electronic device scrubs (732) through the respective content item in accordance with
the swipe input (e.g., scrubbing forward through the respective content item if the
swipe is a rightward horizontal swipe, and scrubbing backward through the respective
content item if the swipe is a leftward horizontal swipe, such as illustrated in Fig. 6L).
In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the second input does
not comprise the navigation to the scrubber bar before the swipe input, the first
electronic device scrolls (734) through the plurality of representations of content items
in accordance with the swipe input (e.g., scrolling left through the representations of
content items if the swipe is a rightward horizontal swipe, and scrolling right through
the representations of content items if the swipe is a leftward horizontal swipe, such as
illustrated in Figs. 6B-6C). Therefore, a swipe while in the playlist mode will
optionally only scrub through the currently-playing content item if the swipe was
inputted while a scrubber bar was selected/activated. In some embodiments, the
appearance of the scrubber bar is changed when the scrubber bar is selected. In some
embodiments, the scrubber bar is selected in response to a prior input that is detected
before detecting the second input (e.g., a separate downward swipe input detected
prior to detecting the horizontal swipe input).
                                             50

[001521          In some embodiments, in accordance with the determination that the
second input comprises the navigation to the scrubber bar before the swipe input, and
while the scrubber bar has a current focus, the first electronic device receives (736) a
third input at the touch-sensitive surface of the one or more input devices, the third
input comprising a contact having an intensity greater than an intensity threshold
detected in a first or a second predefined region of the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a
click in a right or left region of a touch-sensitive surface of a remote control, such as
illustrated in Fig. 6M). In some embodiments, in response to receiving the third input
(738), in accordance with a determination that the intensity of the contact is greater
than the intensity threshold for less than a time threshold (e.g., a click input with a
duration less than .3, .5 or 1 second), the first electronic device skips (740) through
the respective content item by a predetermined amount (e.g., in 10, 15 or 30 second
intervals) in accordance with whether the contact was detected in the first or the
second predefined region of the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., if the click was detected
in the left region of the touch-sensitive surface, the first electronic device optionally
skips backwards 10 seconds in the currently-playing content item; if the click was
detected in the right region of the touch-sensitive surface, the first electronic device
optionally skips forwards 10 seconds in the currently-playing content item, such as
illustrated in Fig. 6M). In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination
that the intensity of the contact is greater than the intensity threshold for greater than
the time threshold (e.g., a click-and-hold input with a duration greater than .3, .5 or 1
second), the first electronic device skips (742) through the respective content item
until the intensity of the contact falls below the intensity threshold (e.g., until the
click-and-hold is released) in accordance with whether the contact was detected in the
first or the second predefined region of the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., if the click
and-hold was detected in the left region of the touch-sensitive surface, the first
electronic device optionally skips backwards in the currently-playing content item
until the click-and-hold is released; if the click-and-hold was detected in the right
region of the touch-sensitive surface, the first electronic device optionally skips
forwards in the currently-playing content item until the click-and-hold is released). In
some embodiments, the change in intensity is detected with one or more intensity
sensors (e.g., pressure sensors) that detect changes in intensity of the contact based on
force measurements and/or contact capacitance measurements. In some
                                              51

embodiments, the change in intensity is detected based on a pressure required to
depress a mechanical switch.
[001531          In some embodiments, after receiving the first input and while the
respective content item is playing in the playlist mode of the first electronic device,
the first electronic device receives (744) a second input comprising a contact detected
in a predefined region of a touch-sensitive surface of the one or more input devices
(e.g., a click or a tap detected in a center region of the touch-sensitive surface). In
some embodiments, in response to receiving the second input (746), in accordance
with a determination that a scrubber bar had current focus when the second input was
received, the first electronic device toggles (748) between playing and pausing the
respective content item in accordance with the second input (e.g., if the respective
content is playing when the click or tap is received, the first electronic device
optionally pauses the respective content item, and if the respective content item is
paused when the click or tap is received, the first electronic device optionally plays
the respective content item, such as illustrated in Figs. 6N-60). In some
embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the scrubber bar did not have
the current focus when the second input was received, the first electronic device
forgoes toggling (750) between playing and pausing the respective content item (e.g.,
switches between the playlist mode and the now playing mode, instead, such as
illustrated in Figs. 6Y-6Z). Therefore, a click or a tap input detected while the
scrubber bar has current focus optionally toggles between playing and pausing a
currently-playing content item, while a click or a tap input detected while the scrubber
bar does not have the current focus optionally does not toggle between playing and
pausing the currently-playing content item.
[00154]          In some embodiments, after receiving the first input and while in the
playlist mode of the first electronic device, the first electronic device makes a first
determination (752) that a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 5, 10 or 20 seconds)
has elapsed without receiving input at the one or more input devices. In some
embodiments, in response to the first determination (754), in accordance with a
second determination that a content item was playing at the first electronic device
when the first determination was made (e.g., a determination that a content item was
playing when 5, 10 or 20 seconds had elapsed without receiving input at the input
devices), the first electronic device transitions (756) to the now playing mode of the
                                              52

first electronic device, including displaying a representation of the playing content
item on the display and ceasing the display of the representations of content items
other than the representation of the playing content item on the display, such as
illustrated in Figs. 6P-6R. In some embodiments, in accordance with a third
determination that a content item was not playing when the first determination was
made, the first electronic device forgoes transitioning (758) to the now playing mode
of the first electronic device. Therefore, if a predetermined amount of time elapses
(e.g., 5, 10 or 20 seconds) without receiving input, and if a content item is currently
playing, the first electronic device optionally transitions to the now playing mode in
which the currently playing content item is displayed. If a content item is not playing
when the predetermined amount of time elapses (e.g., 5, 10 or 20 seconds) without
receiving input, the first electronic device optionally does not transition to the now
playing mode.
[00155]          In some embodiments, after making the first determination that the
predetermined amount of time has elapsed without receiving input at the one or more
input devices and while playing the playing content item in the now playing mode of
the first electronic device, the first electronic device determines (760) that at least one
of the input devices has been picked-up by a user (e.g., using outputs from one or
more of a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and/or similar components in the input
devices, for example, in a remote control). In some embodiments, in response to
determining that the at least one of the input devices has been picked up by the user,
the first electronic device displays (762) a progress bar on the display in the now
playing mode, the progress bar indicating a current play position in the playing
content item (e.g., the progress bar is optionally a horizontal graphic with a length
corresponding to the length of the playing content item, and a current play position
indicator that is positioned in the progress bar at a location corresponding to the
current play position in the playing content item, such as illustrated in Fig. 6H). In
some embodiments, in response to determining that the one or more input devices
have been picked up by a user, the first electronic device optionally also changes an
appearance of the representation of the playing content item by, for example,
darkening the background on the display.
[00156]          In some embodiments, after receiving the first input and while playing
a currently-playing content item on the first electronic device, the first electronic
                                              53

device receives (764) a second input comprising a tap (e.g., a contact having an
intensity less than an intensity threshold for shorter than a time threshold, such as .3,
.5 or 1 second) detected in a first or a second predefined region (e.g., a left or a right
region) of a touch-sensitive surface of the one or more input devices. In response to
receiving the second input (766), in accordance with a determination that the first
electronic device was in the playlist mode when the second input was received, the
first electronic device optionally changes (768) a representation of a content item with
a current focus in accordance with whether the tap was detected in the first or the
second predefined region of the touch-sensitive surface while maintaining the playing
of the currently-playing content item on the first electronic device (e.g., moving the
current focus through the representations of the content items one-by-one, but not
changing the currently-playing content item, such as illustrated in Fig. 6W). For
example, if the tap was detected in the left region of the touch-sensitive surface, the
current focus is optionally moved to the left by one, and if the tap was detected in the
right region of the touch-sensitive surface, the current focus is optionally moved to the
right by one. In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the first
electronic device was in the now playing mode when the second input was received,
the first electronic device forgoes changing (770) the representation of the content
item with the current focus (e.g., a tap in the left or right region of the touch-sensitive
surface while the first electronic device is in the now playing mode optionally does
not move a current focus, such as illustrated in Fig. 6S).
[001571          In some embodiments, after receiving the first input and while playing
a currently-playing content item on the first electronic device, the first electronic
device receives (772) a second input comprising a click (e.g., a contact having an
intensity greater than an intensity threshold) detected in a first or a second predefined
region (e.g., a left or a right region) of a touch-sensitive surface of the one or more
input devices. In response to receiving the second input (774), in accordance with a
determination that the first electronic device was in the playlist mode when the second
input was received, the first electronic device optionally changes (776) a
representation of a content item with a current focus in accordance with whether the
click was detected in the first or the second predefined region of the touch-sensitive
surface while maintaining the playing of the currently-playing content item on the
first electronic device (e.g., moving the current focus through the representations of
                                               54

the content items one-by-one, but not changing the currently-playing content item,
such as illustrated in Fig. 6X). For example, if the click was detected in the left
region of the touch-sensitive surface, the current focus is optionally moved to the left
by one, and if the click was detected in the right region of the touch-sensitive surface,
the current focus is optionally moved to the right by one. In some embodiments, in
accordance with a determination that the first electronic device was in the now
playing mode when the second input was received, the first electronic device changes
(778) the currently-playing content item in accordance with whether the click was
detected in the first or the second predefined region of the touch-sensitive surface
(e.g., changing the currently-playing content item one-by-one, such as illustrated in
Figs. 6T-6U). For example, if the click was detected in the left region of the touch
sensitive surface, the content item previous to the currently-playing content item in
the playlist is optionally played, and if the click was detected in the right region of the
touch-sensitive surface, the content item after the currently-playing content item in the
playlist is optionally played.
[001581          In some embodiments, after receiving the first input and while in the
now playing mode of the first electronic device, the first electronic device receives
(780) a second input via the one or more input devices. In response to receiving the
second input (782), in accordance with a determination that the second input
comprises a click or a tap detected in a predefined region (e.g., a center region) of a
touch-sensitive surface of the one or more input devices, the first electronic device
optionally transitions (784) to the playlist mode of the first electronic device (e.g., a
center click or tap while in the now playing mode optionally transitions the first
electronic device to the playlist mode, such as illustrated in Figs. 6Y-6Z), and in
accordance with a determination that the second input does not comprise a click or a
tap detected in the predefined region of the touch-sensitive surface of the one or more
input devices, the first electronic device optionally maintains (786) display of the now
playing mode of the electronic device (e.g., does not transition to the playlist mode,
but rather remains in the now playing mode).
[00159]          In some embodiments, after receiving the first input and while in the
playlist mode of the first electronic device, the first electronic device receives (788) a
second input, via the one or more input devices, corresponding to navigation to an
action menu including a plurality of actions that can be performed related to a content
                                             55

item with current focus (e.g., the navigation to the action menu optionally comprises
an upward swipe on a touch-sensitive surface of the one or more input devices, such
as illustrated in Fig. 6AA). Selection of the action menu is optionally accomplished
by selection of the action menu after navigating to the action menu, such as illustrated
in Fig. 6BB. In some embodiments, the navigation to the action menu optionally
comprises a click in a top region of the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., region 612b of
touch-sensitive surface 451 in Fig. 6BB). The actions optionally include actions such
as navigating to an album associated with the content item with current focus, playing
the content item with current focus next, adding the content item with current focus to
a list of content items up next, starting playing a station of content items associated
with the content item with current focus, adding the content item with current focus to
a library of content items, adding the content item with current focus to a playlist, and
configuring speakers of the first electronic device, such as illustrated in Fig. 6CC.
After receiving the second input (790), the first electronic device optionally receives
(792) a third input (e.g., a click or a tap on the touch-sensitive surface of the one or
more input devices) selecting a respective action of the plurality of actions, and
optionally performs (794) the selected action with respect to the content item with
current focus (e.g., content item 606-3 in Fig. 6AA).
[00160]          In some embodiments, after receiving the first input and while playing
a currently-playing content item in the now playing mode of the first electronic
device, the first electronic device displays (796) a background on the display (e.g., a
background behind a representation of the currently-playing content item) that
comprises a combination of two versions of artwork for the currently-playing content
item (e.g., album artwork for the currently-playing content item), the two versions of
the artwork being visually manipulated (e.g., rotating and scaling) at different rates
(e.g., the combination is optionally a union of two instances of the same artwork for
the currently-playing content item, the two instances rotating at different rates, and/or
scaling larger and smaller at different rates). In some embodiments, the artwork is the
same artwork as displayed in the representation of the currently-playing content item
displayed on the display.
[00161]          In some embodiments, after receiving the first input and while playing
a currently-playing content item, the first electronic device receives (798) a second
input via the one or more input devices. In response to receiving the second input
                                              56

(798-2), in accordance with a determination that the second input corresponds to a
request to change the currently-playing content item (e.g., a click in a right or left
region of a touch-sensitive surface of the one or more input devices while in the now
playing mode, such as illustrated in Figs. 6S-6U, or a selection of a not currently
playing content item while in the playlist mode, such as illustrated in Figs. 6C-6D),
the first electronic device optionally changes (798-4) the currently-playing content
item in accordance with the second input and switches a background of the display
(e.g., switching to a background based on artwork associated with the new currently
playing content item, such as illustrated in Figs. 6C-6D and 6S-6U), and in
accordance with a determination that the second input corresponds to a request to
change a representation of a content item with a current focus (e.g., as illustrated in
Figs. 6A-6C), the first electronic device optionally changes (798-6) the representation
of the content item with the current focus without switching the background of the
display, such as in Figs. 6A-6C (e.g., the background of the display is optionally only
changed when the content item playing on the first electronic device is changed).
[00162]          In some embodiments, after receiving the first input and while playing
a currently-playing content item in the playlist mode of the first electronic device, the
first electronic device makes a first determination (798-8) that a predetermined
amount of time (e.g., 5, 10 or 20 seconds) has elapsed without receiving input at the
one or more input devices, and in response to the first determination, in accordance
with a determination that a representation of the currently-playing content item did
not have a current focus when the first determination was made, the first electronic
device shifts (798-10) the current focus to the representation of the currently-playing
content item (e.g., bringing the current focus back to the representation of the
currently-playing content item if more than a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 5,
10 or 20 seconds) has elapsed without receiving input while in the playlist mode, such
as illustrated in Figs. 6P-6Q). Thus, in some embodiments, if a representation of a
non-playing content item has the current focus, after a first timeout the focus shifts
back to the currently-playing content item while remaining in the playlist mode, such
as illustrated in Figs. 6P-6Q, and after a second timeout, the device shifts to the now
playing mode, such as illustrated in Figs. 6Q-6R.

content item in the now playing mode of the first electronic device, display (e.g., with
the display enabling unit 806) a background on the display (e.g., the displaying unit
818) that comprises a combination of two versions of artwork for the currently
playing content item, the two versions of the artwork being visually manipulated at
different rates.
[00178]          In some embodiments, the receiving unit 816 is further configured to,
after receiving the first input and while playing (e.g., with the playing unit 812) a
currently-playing content item, receive a second input via the one or more input
devices. In some embodiments, the processing unit 804 is further configured to, in
response to receiving the second input (e.g., with the receiving unit 816): in

[001791          In some embodiments, the processing unit 804 is further configured to:
after receiving (e.g., with the receiving unit 816) the first input and while playing
(e.g., with the playing unit 812) a currently-playing content item in the playlist mode
of the first electronic device (e.g., first electronic device 800), make a first
determination (e.g., with the determining unit 808) that a predetermined amount of
time has elapsed without receiving input at the one or more input devices, and in
response to the first determination, in accordance with a determination (e.g., with the
determining unit 808) that a representation of the currently-playing content item did
not have a current focus when the first determination was made, shift (e.g., with the
display enabling unit 806) the current focus to the representation of the currently
playing content item.
[001801          The operations described above with reference to Figs. 7A-71 are,
optionally, implemented by components depicted in Figs. 1A-1B and 8. For example,
displaying operation 702, receiving operation 704, transitioning operation 708 and
playing operation 710 are, optionally, implemented by event sorter 170, event
recognizer 180, and event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects
a contact on touch-sensitive display 112 (or detects another input, such as an air
gesture input or an input from a remote control if the electronic device does not have a
touch-sensitive display, for example), and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the
event information to application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of
application 136-1 compares the event information to respective event definitions 186,
and determines whether a first contact at a first location on the touch-sensitive surface
corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as selection of an object on a
user interface. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is detected, event
recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the
event or sub-event. Event handler 190 optionally utilizes or calls data updater 176 or
object updater 177 to update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments,
event handler 190 accesses a respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed
by the application. Similarly, it would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the
                                               65

art how other processes can be implemented based on the components depicted in
Figs. 1A-1B and 8.
