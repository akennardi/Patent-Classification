DOWNHOLE COMMUNICATION
Cross-Reference to Related Application
[0001] The content of Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn> is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety.
Field
[0002] The present invention relates to a method and system for downhole communication or
detection for use, in particular though not exclusively, for communicating information to and/or
from a downhole tool in an oil or gas well.
Background
[0003] Once an oil or gas well has been formed it is common to install completion infrastructure
in the well to control production of hydrocarbon fluids from a hydrocarbon-bearing formation
surrounding the well to surface. The completion infrastructure may comprise a string of
downhole tools joined by a string of production tubing to surface. The downhole tools are
generally flow control or circulation devices such as packers, injection sleeves, production
sleeves and the like. Such downhole tools are generally activated mechanically using a shifting
tool attached to a work string to open, close or otherwise shift the position of sliding sleeves.
[0004] Typically a shifting tool is run on a work-string through the completion infrastructure to
mechanically actuate the various downhole tools in a desired sequence. In order to
mechanically actuate a downhole tool, the shifting tool is manipulated (via the work-string)
from surface. Typically, actuation is achieved by locking the shifting tool onto profiles
provided on the downhole tools and pulling (work-string in tension), pushing (work-string in
compression), jarring, or rotating the work string to deliver the necessary force or impact to the
downhole tool with which it is engaged.
[0005] As will be appreciated, it can be difficult to accurately control the operations of the
shifting tool especially when it is situated at the end of several kilometres of work string and/or
the shifting tool is located in a horizontal or highly deviated wellbore. In these situations it is
usually not possible to accurately predict at surface whether the intended actuation has been

                                                  2
successful. An additional disadvantage of these conventional shifting tools is the difficultly of
use. For example, jarring down or slacking off to cause compression of the work-string risks
that the work string will 'catch' on other downhole tools or land on an unintended component
with some force thereby causing damage.
[0006] In view of the aforementioned problems with the use of conventional shifting tools, the
Applicant developed a method for operating a downhole tool described in co-pending UK patent
application no. 1205985.3, in which a work-string is first run into a well without actuating any
downhole tools. The work-string is then used to operate a plurality of downhole tools in a
desired sequence as it is pulled out of the well whilst being maintained in tension. This may
provide an operator at surface with a more positive indication of the location of the shifting tool
and a more accurate log of the operations performed using the shifting tool since every action
requires a positive step in order to perform a subsequent operation. Such a system does not,
however, provide conclusive confirmation that a shifting tool has actually actuated or shifted a
sliding sleeve of a particular downhole tool. Moreover, such a system does not provide any
information about the degree to which a sliding sleeve of a particular downhole tool has been
actuated or shifted.
[0007] It is known to use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags in oil and gas wells for
conveying information between surface and a downhole tool. Although such RFID tags may
have no built-in power supply or battery, such RFID tags do include active electronics (i.e. one
or more electronic devices which are configured to electrically control a flow of electrons or an
electrical current) for storing and communicating information to a tag reader. Such RFID tags
generally include a memory, such as a memory defined on an integrated circuit, for storing
information such a binary code which uniquely identifies the RFID tag.
[0008] For example, it is known to use "Type I" RFID arrangements and methods in which an
RFID tag is located with or embedded into a downhole tool which is installed downhole. An
RFID reader is subsequently run or conveyed downhole past the RFID tag. In response to
reading information from the RFID tag, the RFID reader may communicate directly with the
downhole tool causing the downhole tool to perform a downhole operation. Alternatively, the
RFID reader may be incorporated into a shifting tool which is run or conveyed downhole and
which is configured so that, in response to information read from the tag by the RFID reader, the
shifting tool acts upon the downhole tool and causes the downhole tool to perform a downhole

                                                  3
operation. Additionally or alternatively, the RFID reader may communicate the presence of the
RFID tag to a surface controller. For example, the RFID reader may communicate the presence
of the RFID tag to the surface controller over a cable such as a wireline or the like which
supports the RFID reader, or the RFID reader may communicate the presence of the RFID tag to
the surface controller along a work-string to which the RFID reader is connected. As such, the
use of "Type I" RFID technology may permit bi-directional communications between a
downhole tool and a surface controller. This may not only provide the capability to actuate a
downhole tool, but may also provide real-time access to downhole measurement data, such as
logging data.
[0009] "Type II" RFID arrangements and methods are also known in which an RFID reader is
located with or embedded into a downhole tool which is installed downhole. An RFID tag is
subsequently dropped or pumped downhole where the RFID reader reads the stored information
from the RFID tag and, in response, actuates the downhole tool thereby causing the downhole
tool to perform a downhole operation.
[0010] RFID tags may harvest energy from an electromagnetic field generated by an RFID
reader and store the harvested energy in the form of charge on a capacitance located within the
RFID tag. The charge is subsequently used to power the RFID tag for the wireless
communication of the information stored in the memory of the RFID tag to the RFID reader.
For example, the RFID tag may inductively couple the stored information to the RFID reader
and/or may radiate the stored information to the RFID reader as an electromagnetic signal. In
either case, the RFID tag wirelessly communicates the stored information to the RFID reader by
modulating a harmonically varying electromagnetic field. For example, it is known for a RFID
tag to modulate the amplitude or frequency of a harmonically varying electrical carrier signal
according to a baseband information carrying signal, and to apply the modulated electrical
carrier signal to an antenna of the RFID tag in order to wirelessly communicate information
stored in the memory of the RFID tag to an RFID reader. Accordingly, such RFID downhole
communication methods require the RFID reader and the RFID tag to have active electronics,
for example integrated active electronics for the modulation of the electrical carrier signal.
Active electronics may, however, be prone to failure in the harsh environment of an oil and gas
well. For example, commercially available RFID tags and RFID tag readers and are generally
only rated to 150 0C and may malfunction or may have a limited lifetime at temperatures in
excess of 150 0C. This is particularly true for a RFID tag or a RFID tag reader which is installed

                                                   4
in an oil or gas well for the lifetime of the well which may extend for many years.
Consequently, the use of RFID technology may be prohibited, or the reliability of RFID
technology may be limited, at such temperatures.
[0011] Moreover, as temperature increases, the charge stored on the capacitance of a RFID tag
may dissipate more rapidly thereby reducing a time period over which the RFID tag can
wirelessly communicate information stored in a memory of the RFID tag to the RFID reader. In
practice, this may impose a further restriction on the operating temperature range.
[0012] Accordingly, for the case of Type II RFID technology, it is not uncommon to drop or
pump multiple RFID tags downhole to increase the probability that information stored on at
least one of the RFID tags is wirelessly communicated to an RFID reader for actuation of a
downhole device such as a downhole tool. Even then, actuation of the downhole device may not
be sufficiently reliable depending on the operating temperature.
[0013] It is also known to use inductive coupling downhole for the wireless communication of
data across a pressure barrier between different housing sections of a downhole tool string. For
example, US 6,021,095 entitled "Method and Apparatus for Remote Control of Wellbore End
Devices" discloses the wireless communication of data along an axial direction across a pressure
barrier between different housing sections of a downhole tool string by modulating a
harmonically varying electromagnetic field coupled between a first coil mounted within a first
housing section of a downhole tool string and a second coil mounted within a second housing
section of a downhole tool string.
[0014] It is also known to use an array of electromagnets downhole to move objects along a
throughbore along which the electromagnets are arranged. For example, US 2008/0053662
entitled "Electrically Operated Well Tools" discloses an operating member which includes an
array of permanent magnets and which is moved along a throughbore using an array of
electromagnets arranged along the throughbore. Similarly, US 2008/0202768 entitled "Device
for Selective Movement of Well Tools and also a Method of Using Same" discloses a movable
check valve which comprises a magnetizable material and which is moved along a throughbore
using an array of electromagnets arranged along the throughbore.

Summary of Invention
[0015] It should be understood that one or more of the features, for example the optional
features, defined in relation to any one of the following aspects of the present invention may
apply alone or in any combination in relation to one or more of the other aspects of the present
invention.
[0016] According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a system or
apparatus for use in downhole communication or detection comprising:
        a downhole arrangement defining a throughbore; and
        a primary element and a secondary element,
        wherein one of the primary and secondary elements is provided on the downhole
arrangement and the other of the primary and secondary elements is provided in the
throughbore, and the primary and secondary elements are configurable for coupling of an
electromagnetic field therebetween.
[0017] The electromagnetic field may comprise a magnetic field and/or an electric field. Such a
system may be beneficial for use in determining a degree of coupling of the electromagnetic
field between the primary and secondary elements.
[0018] The secondary element may be configured to provide a characteristic electromagnetic
field. The secondary element may have a geometry and/or may be formed from one or more
materials selected to provide the characteristic electromagnetic field.
[0019] The secondary element may be configured to provide the electromagnetic field coupled
between the first and second elements with one or more characteristic features.
[0020] The secondary element may have a geometry and/or may be formed from one or more
materials selected to provide the electromagnetic field coupled between the first and second
elements with one or more characteristic features.
[0021] Detection of a coupled electromagnetic field between the primary and secondary
elements having one or more features which are characteristic of, or are associated with, the
secondary element may allow the proximity of the secondary element to the primary element to
be detected.

                                                 6
[0022] The secondary element may be incapable of electrically controlling a flow of electrons or
an electrical current.
[0023] The secondary element may be electronically passive.
[0024] In contrast to known RFID tags for use in downhole communication systems, such a
system does not rely upon the modulation of an electrical carrier signal such as a harmonic
electrical carrier signal by a baseband information carrying signal. Accordingly, unlike known
RFID tags, there is no requirement for the secondary element to include any active electronics
for modulating an electrical carrier signal.
[0025] Nor is there any requirement for the secondary element to include any active electronics
for storing information such as a code in a memory. Accordingly, the secondary element may
be formed using robust technology which is able to withstand and operate reliably at
temperatures in excess of 150 'C. In particular, there is no requirement for the secondary
element to include any temperature sensitive semiconductor circuitry. Moreover, due to the
absence of any active electronics in the secondary element, there is no requirement to store
energy in the secondary element that may otherwise be required to power any active electronics.
Consequently, relative to an RFID system, the system may tolerate a greater range of operating
temperatures.
[0026] In contrast to known systems comprising an array of electromagnets for moving objects
along a throughbore along which the electromagnets are arranged, the system of the present
invention is configured for use in downhole communication. In particular, the system of the
present invention is configured for detecting and/or confirming coupling of the electromagnetic
field between the primary and secondary elements. Such a system may provide an indication of
the proximity of the primary and secondary elements.
[0027] The secondary element may be provided on the downhole arrangement which defines the
throughbore. The primary element may be positioned or located in the throughbore of the
downhole arrangement. The primary element may be provided on a tool deployable through the
throughbore of the downhole arrangement. The deployable tool may be movable along the
throughbore of the downhole arrangement so that the primary element passes the secondary
element. Such a system may avoid any requirement for any active electronics to be located
downhole with the downhole arrangement. This may be advantageous where the downhole

                                                 7
arrangement is to be installed downhole for an extended period of time, for example for one or
more years.
[0028] The primary element may be provided on a downhole arrangement which defines a
throughbore. The secondary element may be positioned or located in the throughbore of the
downhole arrangement. The secondary element may be provided on a tool deployable through
the throughbore of the downhole arrangement. The deployable tool may be movable along the
throughbore of the downhole arrangement so that the secondary element passes the primary
element. The secondary element may be configured to be dropped, pumped or otherwise
conveyed along the throughbore of the downhole arrangement so that the secondary element
passes the primary element.
[0029] The downhole arrangement may comprise a downhole tool.
[0030] The deployable tool may comprise a shifting tool for actuating the downhole tool.
[0031] When used in conjunction with a downhole tool, the system may be beneficial for use in
measuring a degree of coupling of the electromagnetic field between the primary and secondary
elements and any changes arising therein on actuation and/or de-actuation of the downhole tool.
Such a system may be used to detect the presence of a downhole tool. Such a system may be
used to provide positive confirmation of a state of the downhole tool before, during and/or after
actuation and/or de-actuation of the downhole tool.
[0032] The system may be configured to measure any degree of coupling of the electromagnetic
field between the primary and secondary elements including the case where the primary and
secondary elements are completely uncoupled and the degree of coupling of the electromagnetic
field between the primary and secondary elements is zero.
[0033] The downhole arrangement may be configurable for at least one of fluid injection,
stimulation, fracturing and production.
[0034] The electromagnetic field may comprise a time-varying magnetic field.
[0035] Coupling of the electromagnetic field may comprise inductively coupling the primary
and secondary elements.

                                                  8
[0036] An alternating electrical signal may be applied to the primary element. When the
primary element is sufficiently close to the secondary element, this may induce an alternating
current in the secondary element. The secondary element may be configured to provide a
characteristic frequency response which is imposed upon the induced alternating current and
coupled to the primary element. The alternating current induced in the primary element may be
detected and analysed. The alternating current induced in the primary element may be
representative of, or be dependent upon, the characteristic frequency response of the secondary
element. As such, the primary element may be used to read information from the secondary
element.
[0037] The electromagnetic field may comprise a time-varying electric field.
[0038] Coupling of the electromagnetic field may comprise capacitively coupling the primary
and secondary elements.
[0039] The electromagnetic field may comprise a static magnetic field.
[0040] The electromagnetic field may comprise a static electric field.
[0041] The primary element may comprise a primary electromagnetic element.
[0042] The secondary element may comprise a secondary electromagnetic element.
[0043] The primary and secondary elements may be configured for alignment along a radial
direction relative to a longitudinal axis defined by the throughbore of the downhole
arrangement.
[0044] The primary and secondary elements may be arranged for coupling of the
electromagnetic field therebetween along a radial direction relative to a longitudinal axis defined
by the throughbore of the downhole arrangement.
[0045] The primary and secondary elements may be configurable for coupling of an
electromagnetic field at a frequency in the range of 10 kHz to 1 MHz, 50 kHz to 500 kHz, or
100 kHz to 150 kHz.

[0046]          Coupling of an electromagnetic field may be possible in such frequency ranges
through any wellbore fluids that may be present between the primary and secondary elements.
[0047] The system may comprise a controller.
[0048] The controller may be electrically coupled to the primary element.
[0049] The controller may be configured to generate and apply an electrical signal to the
primary element.
[0050] The controller may be configured to measure an electrical signal existing on the primary
element.
[0051] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling of the
electromagnetic field between the primary and secondary elements from the measured electrical
signal.
[0052] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling of the
electromagnetic field between the primary and secondary elements according to a frequency
spectrum of the measured electrical signal.
[0053] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling of the
electromagnetic field between the primary and secondary elements according to the shape of the
frequency spectrum of the measured electrical signal.
[0054] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling of the
electromagnetic field between the primary and secondary elements according to a resonant
feature in the frequency spectrum of the measured electrical signal.
[0055] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling of the
electromagnetic field between the primary and secondary elements according to a resonant peak
or dip in the frequency spectrum of the measured electrical signal.

                                               10
[0056] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling of the
electromagnetic field between the primary and secondary elements according to a shape or Q
factor of the resonant feature.
[0057] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling of the
electromagnetic field between the primary and secondary elements according to a frequency of
the resonant feature.
[0058] The controller may be configured to log the determined degree of coupling of the
electromagnetic field between the primary and secondary elements in a memory.
[0059] The deployable tool may comprise the controller.
[0060] The downhole arrangement may comprise the controller.
[0061] The controller may be configured for communication to surface.
[0062] The controller may be located at surface.
[0063] The system may comprise a power source for providing power to the controller.
[0064] The deployable tool may comprise the power source.
[0065] The downhole arrangement may comprise the power source.
[0066] A deployable tool which comprises the controller, the power source and the primary
element may be used to probe or determine a status of a downhole arrangement such as a
downhole tool.
[0067] The primary element may comprise an insulated conductor.
[0068] The primary element may comprise copper.
[0069] The primary element may comprise an electrically conductive turn, loop, coil or ring.

                                                  11
[0070] The primary element may comprise a plurality of electrically conductive turns, loops,
coils or rings.
[0071] The plurality of electrically conductive turns, loops, coils or rings may be connected
electrically in series. Thus, when an electrical current is applied to such a plurality of
electrically conductive turns, loops, coils or rings, each of the turns, loops, coils or rings
generate a respective electromagnetic field at the same time.
[0072] The plurality of electrically conductive turns, loops, coils or rings may be connected
electrically in parallel.
[0073] The primary element may be coiled.
[0074] The primary element may comprise a coil of insulated wire.
[0075] The primary element may have a helical configuration.
[0076] The primary element may extend circumferentially around the deployable tool.
[0077] The primary element may extend completely around the deployable tool. This may
enhance the strength of any electromagnetic coupling between the primary and secondary
elements. This may allow coupling of the electromagnetic field between the primary and
secondary elements if the secondary element is circumferentially non-continuous.
[0078] The primary element may extend part-way around the deployable tool.
[0079] The primary element may be arranged helically around the deployable tool.
[0080] The primary element may be arranged helically around a body portion of the deployable
tool. Such an orientation of the primary element may be accommodated on the deployable tool
without unduly increasing the radial extent of the deployable tool.
[0081] The primary element may be encapsulated in a potting compound. Encapsulation of the
primary element may provide protection for the primary element from an environment
surrounding the primary element.

                                                 12
[0082] The system may comprise a primary enclosure.
[0083] The deployable tool may comprise the primary enclosure.
[0084] The downhole arrangement may comprise the primary enclosure.
[0085] The primary element may be housed within the primary enclosure. The primary
enclosure may provide mechanical protection for the primary element.
[0086] The primary enclosure may be filled with the potting compound. Filling the primary
enclosure with a potting compound may provide support for the primary enclosure and provide
enhanced environmental and mechanical protection for the primary element.
[0087] The potting compound may comprise an epoxy or an elastomeric compound.
[0088] The primary enclosure may comprise a generally tubular base member and a generally
tubular lid member.
[0089] The primary element may be wrapped around the base member.
[0090] At least part of the primary enclosure may be transparent to an electromagnetic field at a
frequency in the range of 10 kHz to 1 MHz, 50 kHz to 500 kHz, or 100 kHz to 150 kHz.
[0091] The primary enclosure may comprise a polyether ether ketone (PEEK) material. As well
as being relatively transparent to an electromagnetic field in the frequency range of the
electromagnetic field, PEEK is a relatively inert material and may be formed and/or machined.
[0092] The primary element may extend around an axis arranged radially relative to a
longitudinal axis of the downhole arrangement. Such an orientation of the primary element may
serve to generate a magnetic field which is directed radially outward towards the secondary
element of the downhole arrangement. This may serve to enhance any coupling of the
electromagnetic field between the primary and secondary elements.
[0093] The primary element may be formed separately from the deployable tool and then fitted
around the deployable tool.

                                                 13
[0094] The primary element may be formed separately from the downhole arrangement and
then fitted around the throughbore defined by the downhole arrangement.
[0095] The primary element may be formed on a substrate.
[0096] The substrate may be generally planar.
[0097] The substrate may be electrically insulating.
[0098] The substrate may be flexible.
[0099] The use of a flexible substrate may allow the substrate to extend or be fitted around, to
adopt or to comply with a non-planar geometry.
[0100] The substrate may extend or be fitted around the deployable tool.
[0101] The substrate may extend or be fitted around the base member of the primary enclosure.
[0102] The substrate may extend or be fitted around the throughbore defined by the downhole
arrangement.
[0103] The substrate may be rigid.
[0104] The primary element may be formed by printing, writing, depositing or otherwise
applying an electrically conductive material to the substrate.
[0105] The primary element may comprise an electrically conductive path or track defined on
the substrate.
[0106] The primary element may have a generally convoluted configuration.
[0107] The primary element may have a spiral configuration.
[0108] Each turn of the primary element may have a curvature which increases towards a centre
of the primary element.

                                                   14
[0109] Each turn of the primary element may comprise one or more straight sections. Each turn,
loop, coil or ring of the primary element may extend around a different axis, each axis arranged
along a different radial direction relative to a longitudinal axis of the deployable tool. The
secondary element may extend circumferentially around the throughbore of the downhole
arrangement.
[0110] The secondary element may extend completely around the throughbore of the downhole
arrangement. This may enhance the strength of any coupling of the electromagnetic field
between the primary and secondary elements. This may allow coupling of the electromagnetic
field between the primary and secondary elements if the primary element is circumferentially
non-continuous.

[0117] The secondary element may have a helical configuration.
[0118] The secondary element may be arranged helically about the throughbore of the downhole
arrangement.

[0120] The capacitance may be electrically connected between two ends of the insulated
conductor.
[0121] The secondary element may comprise a capacitor.

[0125] The downhole arrangement may comprise the secondary enclosure.The secondary
element may be housed within the secondary enclosure.
[0126] The secondary enclosure may be filled with the potting compound.
[0127] The potting compound may comprise an epoxy or a elastomeric compound.
[0128] The secondary enclosure may comprise a generally tubular base member and a generally
tubular lid member. The base member and the lid member may define a generally annular
cavity therebetween. The radial extent of the annular cavity may be selected so that, when the
downhole arrangement comprises the secondary enclosure,
        coupling of the electromagnetic field between the secondary element and a body portion
of the downhole arrangement is avoided or at least reduced. Such coupling of the
electromagnetic field may alter any coupling of the electromagnetic field between the primary
and secondary elements. This may make measurement of a degree of coupling of the
electromagnetic field between the primary and secondary elements from the frequency spectrum
of the measured electrical signal more difficult.
[0129] The deployable tool may comprise the secondary enclosure.
[0130] The secondary element may be wrapped around the base member.
[0131] At least part of the secondary enclosure may be transparent to an electromagnetic field at
a frequency in the range of 10 kHz to 1 MHz, 50 kHz to 500 kHz, or 100 kHz to 150 kHz.
[0132] The secondary enclosure may comprise a polyether ether ketone (PEEK) material.

                                                 16
[0133] The secondary element may extend around an axis arranged radially relative to a
longitudinal axis of the downhole arrangement.
[0134] The secondary element may be formed separately from the downhole arrangement and
then fitted around the throughbore of the downhole arrangement.
[0135] The secondary element may be formed separately from the deployable tool and then
fitted around the deployable tool.
[0136] The secondary element may be formed on a substrate.
[0137] The substrate may be generally planar.
[0138] The substrate may be electrically insulating.
[0139] The substrate may be flexible.
[0140] The use of a flexible substrate may allow the substrate to extend or be fitted around, to
adopt or to comply with a non-planar geometry.
[0141] The substrate may extend or be fitted around the throughbore of the downhole
arrangement.
[0142] The substrate may extend or be fitted around the base member of the secondary
enclosure.
[0143] The substrate may extend or be fitted around the deployable tool.
[0144] The substrate may be rigid.
[0145] The secondary element may be formed by printing, writing, depositing or otherwise
applying an electrically conductive material to the substrate.
[0146] Such a manufacturing process may be controlled more readily than a winding process.
This may enhance the uniformity and/or accuracy of the resonant features and frequencies
associated with a frequency response of the secondary element.

                                                 17
[0147] The secondary element may comprise an electrically conductive path or track defined on
the substrate.
[0148] The secondary element may have a generally convoluted configuration.
[0149] The secondary element may have a spiral configuration.
[0150] The secondary element may comprise one or more turns.
[0151] Each turn of the secondary element may have a curvature which increases towards a
centre of the secondary element.
[0152] Each turn of the secondary element may comprise one or more straight sections.
[0153] A capacitance may be defined on the substrate.
[0154] The substrate may comprise a dielectric material.
[0155] The substrate may comprise a layer of dielectric material.
[0156] The substrate may comprise an electrically conductive layer which is separated from the
electrically conductive path or track by a layer of dielectric material so as to define a
predetermined capacitance between two ends of the electrically conductive path or track.
[0157] The substrate may comprise a dielectric material.
[0158] The substrate may comprise an electrically conductive back-plane.
[0159] The back-plane may be separated from the electrically conductive path or track by the
thickness of the substrate.
[0160] The secondary element may comprise an electrically conductive pad defined on the
substrate.
[0161] The pad may be electrically connected to one end of the electrically conductive path or
track.

                                                 18
[0162] The pad may be defined by an extension or a portion of the electrically conductive path
or track.
[0163] The pad may be defined by a portion of the electrically conductive path or track having a
greater width than the remainder of the electrically conductive path or track.
[0164] The pad may be formed integrally with the electrically conductive path or track.
[0165] The other end of the electrically conductive path or track may be electrically connected
to the back-plane through the substrate so as to define a predetermined capacitance between the
pad and the back-plane. Such a capacitance may be more robust and, therefore, less susceptible
to damage or change in a hostile downhole environment than a capacitor component such as a
surface mount capacitor component.
[0166] The substrate may support a capacitor component which is electrically connected
between two ends of the electrically conductive path or track defined on the substrate.
[0167] The substrate may support a surface mount capacitor.
[0168] The secondary element may comprise an electrically conductive ring.
[0169] The ring may comprise a metal.
[0170] The ring may extend around the throughbore of the downhole arrangement.
[0171] The ring may be defined by an annular portion of the downhole arrangement.
[0172] The secondary element may be configured such that coupling of the electromagnetic
field between the primary and secondary elements as a function of frequency of an electrical
signal applied to the primary element provides a corresponding measured electrical signal on the
primary element having a characteristic frequency spectrum. In other words, the secondary
element may be configured so as to have a characteristic frequency response.
[0173] The predetermined frequency spectrum may have a predetermined shape.

                                                  19
[0174] The predetermined frequency spectrum may include a resonant feature having a
predetermined shape.
[0175] The resonant feature may comprise a resonant peak or dip.
[0176] The resonant feature may have a predetermined Q-factor.
[0177] The resonant feature may have a predetermined resonant frequency.
[0178] The predetermined resonant frequency may be predetermined for a given temperature
and/or pressure to which the secondary element is exposed.
[0179] A material and/or geometry of the secondary element may be selected so as to provide
the secondary element with a characteristic frequency response. This may result in the
measured electrical signal on the primary element having a characteristic frequency spectrum.
[0180] A capacitance of the secondary element may be selected so as to provide the secondary
element with a characteristic frequency response.
[0181] The system may comprise a tertiary element.
[0182] The tertiary element may comprise any of the features of which the primary element may
comprise.
[0183] The tertiary element may be provided with the primary element but may be electrically
insulated from and, therefore, independent of the primary element.
[0184] The tertiary element may be coupled to the electromagnetic field which is coupled
between the primary and secondary elements.
[0185] Such a tertiary element may at least partially isolate an electrical signal induced in the
tertiary element from an electrical signal applied to the primary element. This may reduce
electrical noise induced in the tertiary element, thereby improving measurement sensitivity.
[0186] The tertiary element may extend circumferentially or helically relative to a longitudinal
axis of the deployable tool. The primary element may comprise a plurality of electrically

                                                   20
conductive turns, loops, coils or rings connected electrically in series, each turn, loop, coil or
ring of the primary element may extend around a different axis, each axis may be arranged along
a different radial direction relative to a longitudinal axis of the deployable tool, and each turn,
loop, coil or ring of the primary element may be elongated in an axial direction relative to a
longitudinal axis of the deployable tool.
[0187] Conversely, the primary element may extend circumferentially or helically relative to a
longitudinal axis of the deployable tool. The tertiary element may comprise a plurality of
electrically conductive turns, loops, coils or rings, the electrically conductive turns, loops, coils
or rings of the tertiary element may be connected electrically in series, each turn, loop, coil or
ring of the tertiary element may extend around a different axis, wherein each axis is arranged
along a different radial direction relative to a longitudinal axis of the deployable tool, and each
turn, loop, coil or ring of the tertiary element may be elongated in an axial direction relative to a
longitudinal axis of the deployable tool.
[0188] Such arrangements of the primary and the tertiary elements may mean that the
electromagnetic field coupled from the primary element is generally orthogonally oriented
relative to an electromagnetic field coupled to the tertiary element. This may further reduce any
cross-coupling of a signal from the primary element directly to the tertiary element without first
inducing an AC current in the secondary element. This may reduce noise on the signal induced
in the tertiary element, thereby improving measurement sensitivity.
[0189] The tertiary element may be electrically connected to the controller.
[0190] The controller may be configured to measure an electrical signal existing on the tertiary
element.
[0191] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling of the
electromagnetic field between the secondary element and the tertiary element. The
electromagnetic field coupled from the primary element to the secondary element may be
separated in space and/or in time from the electromagnetic field coupled from the secondary
element to the tertiary element.

                                                 21
[0192] The electromagnetic field coupled from the primary element to the secondary element
may at least partially overlap in space and/or in time with the electromagnetic field coupled
from the secondary element to the tertiary element.
[0193] The electromagnetic field coupled from the primary element to the secondary element
may be orthogonal to the electromagnetic field coupled from the secondary element to the
tertiary element.
[0194] The electromagnetic field coupled from the primary element to the secondary element
may have the same frequency as the electromagnetic field coupled from the secondary element
to the tertiary element.
[0195] The electromagnetic field coupled from the primary element to the secondary element
may have a different frequency to the electromagnetic field coupled from the secondary element
to the tertiary element.
[0196] The controller may be configured to determine a characteristic frequency response of the
secondary element.
[0197] The secondary element may be configured to modify the electromagnetic field coupled
thereto from the primary element by imposing the characteristic frequency response on the
electromagnetic field coupled thereto from the primary element.
[0198] The primary element may be configured to stimulate the secondary element with a
stimulating electromagnetic field as a function of frequency and the tertiary element may be
configured to sense an electromagnetic field provided by the secondary element as a function of
frequency in response to stimulation of the secondary element with the stimulating
electromagnetic field.
[0199] The controller may be configured to detect the proximity of the tertiary element to the
secondary element according to a result of a comparison between the frequency spectrum of the
electromagnetic field sensed by the tertiary element and a characteristic frequency spectrum
associated with the secondary element.
[0200] The downhole arrangement may comprise a plurality of secondary elements.

                                               22
[0201] Each secondary element of the plurality of secondary elements may comprise one or
more of the features of which the secondary element may comprise.
[0202] At least two of the secondary elements may be configured so that an electrical signal
existing on the primary element when a respective electromagnetic field is coupled between the
primary element and each of the at least two secondary elements has a different predetermined
frequency spectrum over a frequency range of the electromagnetic field.
[0203] Each secondary element may be configured such that coupling of a respective
electromagnetic field from each secondary element and the primary element provides a
corresponding measured electrical signal having a characteristic frequency spectrum. In other
words, each secondary element may be configured so as to have a characteristic frequency
response. The resulting series of frequency responses may be used to encode information. For
example, such an arrangement may permit a number to be encoded as a series of different
frequency responses. The number may, for example, be a unique identification code for the
downhole arrangement with which the plurality of secondary elements is associated or on which
the plurality of secondary elements is mounted. This may allow the downhole arrangement to
be distinguished from other downhole arrangements in the same completion string. This may
allow the downhole arrangement to be uniquely identified.
[0204] Each secondary element may be configured so that an electrical signal existing on the
primary element when a respective electromagnetic field is coupled between the primary
element and each secondary element has a different predetermined frequency spectrum over a
frequency range of the electromagnetic field.
[0205] Each predetermined frequency spectrum may have a predetermined shape.
[0206] Each predetermined frequency spectrum may include a resonant feature having a
predetermined shape.
[0207] Each resonant feature may comprise a resonant peak or dip.
[0208] Each resonant feature may have a predetermined Q-factor.
[0209] Each resonant feature may have a predetermined resonant frequency.

                                                 23
[0210] Each predetermined resonant frequency may be predetermined for a given temperature
and/or pressure to which each secondary element is exposed.
[0211] Each secondary element may be configured so as to avoid the resonant frequency of any
one secondary element being a multiple of the resonant frequency of any other secondary
element. This may avoid the possibility of harmonic effects.
[0212] A material and/or geometry of each secondary element may be selected so as to provide
the secondary e element with a characteristic frequency spectrum.
[0213] A capacitance of each secondary element may be selected so as to provide the secondary
element with a characteristic frequency spectrum.
[0214] The configuration of each secondary element may be selected from a finite set of
different secondary element configurations. Each secondary element configuration may have a
corresponding characteristic frequency response. This may permit a secondary element
configuration to be determined from the measurement of the frequency response.
[0215] Each characteristic frequency response may be associated with a different symbol of a
code. Accordingly, each secondary element configuration may be associated with or may
represent a different symbol of a code. The plurality of frequency responses associated with the
plurality of secondary elements may define the code.
[0216] Each secondary element may be unconnected electrically to the other secondary
elements.
[0217] One or more of the secondary elements may be configured to be selectively altered.
[0218] Such secondary elements may allow a code to be selectively written to the plurality of
secondary elements before and/or after deployment of the downhole arrangement. This may
allow a unique identification code to be selectively written to the plurality of secondary
elements for the unique identification of the downhole tool on which the secondary elements are
mounted. This may allow the downhole tool to be identified unambiguously when deployed as
part of a completion string which includes multiple downhole tools.

                                                 24
[0219] When the downhole tool is deployed as part of a completion string which includes
multiple downhole tools, each downhole tool may be configured to have a plurality of secondary
elements, wherein each of the pluralities of secondary elements of the different downhole tools
are initially identically configured. Each of the identically configured pluralities of secondary
elements of the different downhole tools may be later selectively written with a unique
identification code for the corresponding downhole tool on which the secondary elements are
mounted. This may allow each downhole tool to be manufactured with an identically
configured plurality of secondary elements which is later selectively written with a unique
identification code either later during the manufacturing process or at the point of use either at
the wellhead or downhole. This may simplify logistics and reduce or eliminate any inventory
problems that may be associated with the manufacture of downhole tools which each have a
differently configured plurality of secondary elements.
[0220] Additionally or alternatively, other information may be written to the secondary
elements. For example, the number and/or nature of operations performed by the downhole tool
on which the secondary elements are mounted may be selectively written to the secondary
elements.
[0221] One or more of the secondary elements may be configured to be irreversibly altered.
[0222] One or more of the secondary elements may be configured for selective alteration of a
frequency response of the secondary element.
[0223] One or more of the secondary elements may be configured for selective alteration of a
resonant feature of the frequency response of the secondary element.
[0224] One or more of the secondary elements may be configured for selective alteration of a
shape of a resonant feature of the frequency response of the secondary element.
[0225] One or more of the secondary elements may be configured for selective alteration of a
frequency of a resonant feature of the frequency response of the secondary element.
[0226] One or more of the secondary elements may be configured for selective suppression of a
resonant feature of the frequency response of the secondary element.

                                                 25
[0227] One or more of the secondary elements may be configured for selective elimination of a
resonant feature of the frequency response of the secondary element.
[0228] One or more of the secondary elements may be configured for selective alteration by
melting, fusing, burning and/or breaking.
[0229] One or more of the secondary elements may be configured for selective alteration by
exposing the secondary element to an electromagnetic field of sufficient strength. The
controller may be configured to generate and apply an electrical signal to the primary element of
sufficient strength for this purpose.
[0230] The material and/or geometry of one or more of the secondary elements may be
configured for selective alteration by coupling an electromagnetic field of sufficient strength
with the secondary element.
[0231] One or more of the secondary elements may comprise an electrical conductor having a
resistivity and/or a cross-sectional geometry configured to fuse and/or break on coupling an
electromagnetic field of sufficient strength with the secondary element.
[0232] One or more of the secondary elements may comprise an electrically conductive portion
having a resistivity and/or a cross-sectional geometry configured to fuse and/or break on
coupling of an electromagnetic field of sufficient strength with the secondary element.
[0233] Each secondary element may extend circumferentially around the throughbore of the
downhole arrangement.
[0234] Each secondary element may extend completely around the throughbore of the downhole
arrangement. This may enhance the strength of any coupling of an electromagnetic field
between the primary element and each secondary element.
[0235] Each secondary element may extend part-way around the throughbore of the downhole
arrangement.
[0236] The plurality of secondary elements may be axially distributed.

                                                   26
[0237] The different secondary elements may be axially separated or axially adjacent to one
another.
[0238] Each secondary element may comprise an insulated conductor.
[0239] Each secondary element may comprise copper.
[0240] Each secondary element may comprise an electrically conductive core surrounded by an
electrically insulating outer layer.
[0241] Each secondary element may be coiled.
[0242] Each secondary element may have a helical configuration.
[0243] Each secondary element may be arranged helically about the throughbore of the
downhole arrangement.
[0244] Each secondary element may comprise a capacitance.
[0245] The capacitance may be electrically connected between two ends of the insulated
conductor of the secondary element.
[0246] Each secondary element may comprise a capacitor.
[0247] The capacitor may be electrically connected between two ends of the insulated
conductor.
[0248] Each secondary element may extend around an axis arranged along a radial direction
relative to a longitudinal axis of the downhole arrangement.
[0249] The secondary elements may be circumferentially distributed.
[0250] Each secondary element may extend around a different axis, each axis arranged along a
different radial direction relative to a longitudinal axis of the downhole arrangement.

                                                 27
[0251] Each secondary element may be formed separately from the downhole arrangement and
then fitted around the throughbore of the downhole arrangement.
[0252] Each secondary element may be formed on a common substrate.
[0253] Each secondary element may be formed on a different substrate.
[0254] Each substrate may be generally planar.
[0255] Each substrate may be electrically insulating.
[0256] Each substrate may be flexible.
[0257] Each substrate may be fitted around the throughbore of the downhole arrangement.
[0258] Each substrate may be fitted around the base member of the secondary enclosure.
[0259] The use of one or more flexible substrates may allow the one or more substrates to be
fitted around, to adopt or to comply with a non-planar geometry. For example, this may allow
the one or more substrates to be fitted around, to adopt or to comply with the throughbore of the
downhole arrangement or an outer surface of the base member of the secondary enclosure.
[0260] Each secondary element may be formed by printing, writing, depositing or otherwise
applying an electrically conductive material to a substrate. Thus, each secondary element may
be formed using a relatively inexpensive manufacturing technique.
[0261] Each secondary element may comprise an electrically conductive path or track defined
on a substrate.
[0262] Each secondary element may define an electrically conductive path or track on a
substrate having a different configuration to the electrically conductive path or track of every
other secondary element.
[0263] Each secondary element may have a generally convoluted configuration.
[0264] Each secondary element may have a spiral configuration.

                                                 28
[0265] Each secondary element may comprise one or more turns.
[0266] Each turn of each secondary element may have a curvature which increases towards a
centre of the secondary element.
[0267] Each turn of each secondary element may comprise one or more straight sections.
[0268] Each substrate may be configured to support a capacitor which is electrically connected
between two ends of the electrically conductive path or track defined on the substrate.
[0269] Each substrate may define a capacitance between two ends of the electrically conductive
path or track defined on the substrate.
[0270] Each substrate may comprise a dielectric material.
[0271] Each substrate may comprise a layer of dielectric material.
[0272] Each substrate may comprise an electrically conductive layer which is separated from
the electrically conductive path or track by a layer of dielectric material so as to define a
predetermined capacitance between two ends of the electrically conductive path or track.
[0273] Each substrate may comprise a dielectric material which extends through a thickness of
the substrate.
[0274] Each substrate may comprise an electrically conductive back-plane which is separated
from the electrically conductive path or track by the dielectric material of the substrate so as to
define a predetermined capacitance between two ends of the electrically conductive path or
track.
[0275] The plurality of secondary elements may comprise a plurality of electrically conductive
rings distributed axially along a longitudinal axis of the downhole arrangement, each ring
extending around the throughbore of the downhole arrangement.
[0276] The rings may be arranged axially adjacent to one another.

                                               29
[0277] Each ring may be configured such that coupling of an electromagnetic field between
each ring and the primary element provides a corresponding measured electrical signal having a
characteristic frequency spectrum. In other words, each ring may have a corresponding
characteristic frequency response.
[0278] Each ring may be configured such that coupling of an electromagnetic field between
each ring and the primary element provides a corresponding measured electrical signal having a
characteristic frequency spectrum over a frequency range of the electromagnetic field.
[0279] The configuration of each ring may be selected from a finite set of different ring
configurations. Each ring configuration may have a corresponding characteristic frequency
response. This may permit a ring configuration to be determined from the measurement of the
frequency response.
[0280] Each characteristic frequency response may be associated with a different symbol of a
code. Accordingly, each ring configuration may be associated with or may represent a different
symbol of a code. The plurality of frequency responses associated with the plurality of rings
may define the code.
[0281] Each ring configuration may be defined at least in part by an inner profile of the ring.
[0282] Each ring configuration may be defined at least in part by an inner diameter of the ring.
[0283] Each ring configuration may be defined at least in part by a material from which the ring
is formed.
[0284] Each ring configuration may be defined at least in part by an axial extent of the ring.
[0285] The finite set of ring configurations may comprise a first ring configuration and a second
ring configuration.
[0286] The first ring configuration may represent a first symbol of a binary code and the second
ring configuration may represent a second symbol of the binary code.

                                                   30
[0287] The finite set of ring configurations may comprise a plurality of data ring configurations
and a checking ring configuration which is different from the data ring configurations. A ring
configured according to the checking ring configuration may have an inner diameter which is
different to the inner diameter of a ring configured according to any of the data ring
configurations. A ring configured according to the checking ring configuration may be formed
from an electrically insulating material and a ring configured according to a data ring
configuration may be formed from an electrically conductive material. A ring configured
according to the checking ring configuration may have a different axial extent to a ring
configured according to a data ring configuration.
[0288] The plurality of rings may define a series of rings in which a checking ring is included
repeatedly. In such a series of rings, the repeated appearance of a checking ring may enable a
checking function to be performed in which the series of frequency responses corresponding to
the series of ring configurations is checked to ascertain whether the frequency response
corresponding to the checking ring configuration is measured in the correct repeating series.
This may permit a series of readings obtained while the primary element is stationary relative to
the series of rings to be distinguished from a series of readings obtained as the primary element
is run past the series of rings.
[0289] The plurality of rings may define a series of rings in which a checking ring is included
with a regular axial periodicity.
[0290] Alternate rings in the series of rings may be checking rings.
[0291] The plurality of rings may define a series of rings which are configured to permit a
change in a direction of the primary element relative to the secondary element to be determined
when the primary element is located adjacent to the secondary element. For example, the
plurality of rings may define a series of rings in which a series of ring configurations is repeated
at least once. This may also provide a way of checking the accuracy of a series of frequency
responses obtained from a series of rings. This may provide a more reliable code detection
method and/or provide greater confidence in the code detection method.
[0292] The plurality of secondary elements may comprise an axially inner plurality of rings, a
first axially outer plurality of rings, and a second axially outer plurality of rings.

                                                   31
[0293] The series of ring configurations of the first axially outer plurality of rings may be
different to the series of ring configurations of the axially inner plurality of rings and the second
axially outer plurality of rings.
[0294] The series of ring configurations of the second axially outer plurality of rings may be
different to the series of ring configurations of the axially inner plurality of rings and the first
axially outer plurality of rings.
[0295] One of the series of ring configurations of the first and second axially outer plurality of
rings may define a unique start code and the other may define a unique end code. This may
permit the code extracted from reading the axially inner plurality of rings to be interpreted as
data. The use of such start and end codes may serve to avoid false readings.
[0296] The downhole arrangement may be configurable between a first configuration in which
coupling of an electromagnetic field between the primary and secondary elements is prevented
and a second configuration in which coupling of an electromagnetic field between the primary
and secondary elements is permitted.
[0297] The secondary element may be covered so as to prevent coupling with an
electromagnetic field generated by the primary element when the downhole arrangement is in
the first configuration. The secondary element may be accessible by an electromagnetic field
generated by the primary element when the downhole arrangement is in the second
configuration.
[0298] The downhole arrangement may be configurable between the first and second
configurations on actuation or de-actuation of the downhole arrangement. Thus, detection of a
change in a degree of coupling of an electromagnetic field between the primary and secondary
elements may provide a positive indication of actuation or de-actuation of the downhole
arrangement.
[0299] The downhole arrangement may comprise a cover member.
[0300] The cover member may comprise a cover sleeve.

                                                 32
[0301] The secondary element may be arranged radially outwardly of the cover sleeve relative
to a longitudinal axis of the throughbore of the downhole arrangement.
[0302] The secondary element and the cover member may be moveable relative to one another.
[0303] The cover member may extend at least partially between the secondary element and the
throughbore of the downhole arrangement in the first configuration and the cover member may
be at least partially withdrawn from between the secondary element and the throughbore of the
downhole arrangement in the second configuration.
[0304] The secondary element may be attached to a body portion of the downhole arrangement
and the cover member may be slideable relative to the body portion on actuation or de-actuation
of the downhole arrangement.
[0305] The cover member may be attached to a body portion of the downhole arrangement and
the secondary element may be slideable relative to the body portion on actuation or de-actuation
of the downhole arrangement.
[0306] The downhole arrangement may comprise a plurality of further secondary elements for
coupling of an electromagnetic field with the primary element.
[0307] The plurality of further secondary elements may comprise one or more of the features of
which the plurality of secondary elements may comprise. The further secondary elements may
be accessible for coupling of an electromagnetic field with the primary element regardless of a
status of the downhole arrangement. The presence of such further secondary elements may
permit identification of the downhole arrangement regardless of whether the downhole
arrangement is in an actuated or a de-actuated state.
[0308] The further secondary elements may be configured for location downhole of the
secondary element. This may permit the primary element of the deployable tool to detect the
further secondary elements before it detects the secondary element or elements as the deployable
tool is pulled uphole from a position downhole of the further secondary elements. If the further
secondary elements are accessible for coupling of an electromagnetic field with the primary
element regardless of a status of the downhole arrangement, this may permit the deployable tool
to identify the downhole arrangement via electromagnetic coupling between the primary

                                                 33
element and the further secondary elements and then check the status of the downhole
arrangement via the coupling of an electromagnetic field between the primary element and the
secondary element or elements.
[0309] The system may be configured to apply an electrical signal such as a harmonically
varying electrical signal to the primary element during a transmit period and to detect an
electrical signal present on the primary element during a receive period which is subsequent to
the transmit period. The electrical signal present on the primary element during the receive
period may be characteristic of the configuration of any secondary element coupled with the
primary element. The electrical signal present on the primary element during the receive period
may be caused by a characteristic time-variant response or ringing of any secondary element
coupled with the primary element.
[0310] The secondary element may be configured to provide a characteristic time-variant
response during the receive period when coupled to the primary element during the transmit
period. For example, the geometry and/or materials of which the secondary element are formed
may be selected to provide a characteristic time-variant response during the receive period when
coupled to the primary element during the transmit period.
[0311] Applying and detecting electrical signals via the primary element during different
sequential transmit and receive periods in this way may serve to improve measurement
sensitivity compared to the case where an electrical signal is applied to the primary element and
detected from the primary element during the same time period. Applying and detecting
electrical signals via the primary element during different sequential transmit and receive
periods allows the primary and secondary elements to be arranged to maximise coupling of the
electromagnetic field. This may serve to improve measurement sensitivity compared to the case
where an electrical signal is applied to a primary element to stimulate or excite a secondary
element via the coupled electromagnetic field and an electrical signal is detected on a separate
tertiary element because the primary and tertiary elements must be generally orthogonal to
reduce cross-talk.
[0312] The system may comprise a signal generator for applying the electrical signal to the
primary element during the transmit period.

                                                 34
[0313] The system may comprise a signal receiver for detecting the electrical signal present on
the primary element during the receive period.
[0314] The signal generator may be configured to apply a first electrical signal at a first
frequency to the primary element during a first transmit period and the signal receiver may be
configured to detect an electrical signal present on the primary element during a first receive
period which is subsequent to the first transmit period.
[0315] The signal generator may be configured to apply a second electrical signal at a second
frequency to the primary element during a second transmit period and the signal receiver may be
configured to detect an electrical signal present on the primary element during a second receive
period which is subsequent to the second transmit period.
[0316] The signal generator may apply electrical signals at different frequencies to the primary
element, one frequency at a time. For each frequency, the signal receiver may subsequently
detect an electrical signal present on the primary element. This may allow the system to step or
sweep through a frequency range searching for a characteristic response which is known to be
associated with a given secondary element, thereby indicating the proximity of the given
secondary element to the primary element.
[0317] The deployable tool may comprise a plurality of primary elements.
[0318] The plurality of primary elements may be electrically unconnected. Each primary
element may be independently electrically connected to the controller. The controller may be
configured to measure an electrical signal existing on each of the primary elements. The
controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling of a corresponding
electromagnetic field between each of the primary elements and the secondary element from the
measured electrical signals.
[0319] Each primary element may allow measurement of a degree of coupling of a
corresponding electromagnetic field with a secondary element. As such, the plurality of primary
elements may allow repeated detection of the secondary element. This may improve accuracy
and/or confidence in the detection of the secondary element. A plurality of primary elements
may also provide one or more spare primary elements which may be relied upon in the event of
failure of one of the primary elements.

                                                   35
[0320] Each primary element may comprise one or more of the features of which the primary
element may comprise.
[0321] The plurality of primary elements may be axially distributed.
[0322] The plurality of primary elements may be axially separated or axially adjacent.
[0323] Each primary element may extend around an axis arranged along a radial direction
relative to a longitudinal axis of the throughbore of the downhole arrangement.
[0324] The plurality of primary elements may be circumferentially distributed.
[0325] Each primary element may extend around a different axis, each axis arranged along a
different radial direction relative to a longitudinal axis of the throughbore of the downhole
arrangement. Such a plurality of primary elements may permit discrimination of the
circumferential position of the secondary element relative to the plurality of primary elements.
[0326] The system may be configured to apply an electrical signal to each primary element.
This may establish a more uniform electromagnetic field around the plurality of primary
elements for the detection of one or more secondary elements. For example, where the primary
elements are arranged extend around a different axis, each axis arranged along a different radial
direction relative to a longitudinal axis of the throughbore of the downhole arrangement, this
may result in a more circumferentially uniform electromagnetic field. This may be important
when the primary elements are being moved along the throughbore of the downhole
arrangement but where the rotational alignment of the primary and secondary elements relative
to an axis of the throughbore is unknown.
[0327] The system may be configured to apply an electrical signal to each primary element
sequentiallyThe system may be configured to apply a harmonically varying electrical signal to
each primary element sequentially.
[0328] The system may be configured to apply different electrical signals to different primary
elements at different times.

                                                  36
[0329] The system may be configured to apply an electrical signal having a first frequency
sequentially to each primary element and then to apply an electrical signal having a second
frequency sequentially to each primary element.
[0330] The system may be configured to sequentially apply electrical signals having different
frequencies to a first primary element. The system may be configured to sequentially apply
electrical signals having different frequencies to a second primary element.
[0331] The system may be configured to apply an electrical signal to each primary element
simultaneously.
[0332] The system may be configured to apply different electrical signals to each primary
element simultaneously.
[0333] The system may be configured to apply different electrical signals to each primary
element at the same frequency but with a different phase.
[0334] Each primary element may comprise a pair of coils which are connected electrically in
parallel. Both coils of each primary element may be located diametrically opposite one another
relative to a throughbore of a downhole arrangement. The use of such primary elements may
reduce the complexity of the electronic circuitry used to drive the primary elements. For
example, the use of such primary elements may mean that the number of signal generator
channels required to drive the primary elements is half the number of coils. Each primary
element may be mounted on a body such as a body of the deployable tool.
[0335] The body may be formed of a non-magnetic material or may be non-magnetisable. This
may at least partially suppress any coupling of the electromagnetic field through the body. This
may serve to provide a more uniform electromagnetic field around the body.
[0336] The body may be formed of a magnetic or a magnetisable material such as a ferrite or the
like. This may serve to enhance any coupling of the electromagnetic field through the body.
This may be advantageous for providing a more uniform electromagnetic field around the body.
Where each primary element comprises a pair of parallel connected diametrically opposed coils,
the coils may be connected together so that the electromagnetic fields provided by the coils add
constructively or re-enforce one another.

                                                   37
[0337] The coils of each primary element may have a circumferential extent of 30' - 1500, 600
1200, or approximately 900 relative to an axis of the throughbore of the downhole arrangement.
Such a circumferential extent of the coils of each primary element may provide a
circumferentially more uniform electromagnetic field.
[0338] A coil of each primary element may overlap circumferentially with a coil of an adjacent
primary element. Overlapping the circumferential extent of adjacent coils in this way may
provide a circumferentially more uniform electromagnetic field and may, in particular, avoid the
presence of any dips or nulls in the electromagnetic field around the plurality of primary
elements.
[0339] The circumferential overlap may be between 00 - 400, 100 - 300, or approximately 200
relative to an axis of the throughbore of the downhole arrangement.
[0340] The system may be configured to apply an electrical signal to the coils of each primary
element one at a time to ensure that the electromagnetic field is swept circumferentially around
the plurality of primary elements.
[0341] The frequency of the electrical signal may be stepped over a desired frequency range
which is known to include the characteristic frequencies, such as the characteristic frequencies
of any resonant frequencies associated with the secondary elements to be detected.
[0342] The frequency step size may be selected so as to be smaller than a bandwidth of resonant
features in the frequency responses of the secondary elements.
[0343] The system may be configured to apply an electrical signal at a first frequency to the
coils of the first primary element during a first transmit period.
[0344] The system may be configured to detect any residual response of one of the secondary
elements such as any residual ringing of one of the secondary elements present on the coils of
the first primary element at the first frequency during a first receive period subsequent to the
first transmit period.
[0345] The system may be configured to apply an electrical signal at a second frequency to the
coils of the first primary element during a second transmit period.

                                                    38
[0346] The system may be configured to detect any residual response of one of the secondary
elements such as any residual ringing of one of the secondary elements present on the coils of
the first primary element at the second frequency during a second receive period subsequent to
the second transmit period.
[0347] The system may be configured to repeat the transmit and receive steps for the first
primary element for each frequency in the desired frequency range. The system may be
configured to repeat the transmit and receive steps for each frequency in the desired frequency
range for each of the other primary elements to ensure a sweep of the electromagnetic field both
circumferentially around the plurality of primary elements and through the desired frequency
range.
[0348] Alternatively, the system may be configured to apply an electrical signal at a first
frequency to the coils of the first primary element during a first transmit period and to detect an
electrical signal present on the coils of the first primary element during a first receive period
subsequent to the first transmit period and to then apply an electrical signal at the first frequency
to the coils of the second primary element during a second transmit period and to detect an
electrical signal present on the coils of the second primary element during a second receive
period subsequent to the first transmit period. The system may be configured to repeat the
transmit and receive steps for the coils of the remaining primary elements before the frequency
is stepped up to the next frequency in the desired frequency range. The system may be
configured to repeat the process for each of the primary elements at each frequency in the
desired frequency range.
[0349] The one or more primary elements may be provided on the downhole arrangement and
the one or more secondary elements and/or the one or more further secondary elements may be
provided in the throughbore defined by the downhole arrangement. In such a system, the
downhole arrangement may also include a controller and a power supply. The one or more
secondary elements and/or the one or more further secondary elements may be run, dropped,
pumped or otherwise conveyed along the throughbore defined by the downhole arrangement. In
such a system, the one or more secondary elements and/or the one or more further secondary
elements may serve as a tag which may be provided from surface for the communication of
information from surface to the downhole arrangement. However, unlike an RFID tag which
incorporates active electronics, the one or more secondary elements and/or the one or more

                                                39
further secondary elements would be electronically passive and would therefore be more robust
and more reliable in a high temperature environment.
[0350] The one or more secondary elements and/or the one or more further secondary elements
may be mounted on a carrier such as a mandrel or the like. The carrier may be configured to be
dropped, pumped or otherwise conveyed in a fluid along the throughbore defined by the
downhole arrangement. The carrier may comprise a head portion and an elongated body
portion. Such a carrier may result in the one or more secondary elements and/or the one or more
further secondary elements adopting a preferred orientation relative to the throughbore of the
downhole arrangement when conveyed by a fluid flowing along the throughbore. This may
serve to improve the coupling of an electromagnetic field between the primary element located
on the downhole arrangement and the one or more secondary elements and/or the one or more
further secondary elements. The one or more secondary elements and/or the one or more further
secondary elements may be encapsulated for mechanical and/or environmental protection.

arrangement for use in downhole detection, the downhole arrangement defining a throughbore

perform a wellbore operation.
[0354] The downhole arrangement may be configurable for at least one of fluid injection,
stimulation, fracturing and production.
[0355] The downhole arrangement may be assembled with, connected to, coupled to or
otherwise joined to one or more further downhole arrangements to form a completion string for
an oil or gas well.

arrangement and the deployable tool comprising an element configurable for coupling of an
electromagnetic field with a further element provided on the downhole arrangement.
[0357] According to a fourth aspect of the present invention there is provided an element for use
in downhole communication or detection, the element being configured for deployment in a
throughbore defined by a downhole arrangement and the element being configured for coupling
of an electromagnetic field with a further element provided on the downhole arrangement.
[0358] Such an element may be run, dropped, pumped or otherwise conveyed along the
throughbore defined by the downhole arrangement. The downhole arrangement may include a
controller and a power supply and the element may serve as a tag which may be provided from
surface for the communication of information from surface to the further element provided on
the downhole arrangement. However, unlike an RFID tag which incorporates active electronics,
the element would be electronically passive and would therefore be more robust and more
reliable in a high temperature environment.
[0359] The element may be mounted on a carrier such as a mandrel or the like. The carrier may
be configured to be dropped, pumped or otherwise conveyed in a fluid along the throughbore
defined by the downhole arrangement. The carrier may comprise a head portion and an
elongated body portion. Such a carrier may result in the element adopting a preferred
orientation relative to the throughbore of the downhole arrangement when conveyed by a fluid
flowing along the throughbore. This may serve to improve the coupling of an electromagnetic
field between the element and the further element provided on the downhole arrangement. The
element may be encapsulated for mechanical and/or environmental protection.

[0597] The stimulator element may comprise an insulated electrical conductor.

                                                  63
[0598] The stimulator element may extend along a path having at least one loop or turn.
[0599] The stimulator element may extend along a helical path or a spiral path.
[0600] The stimulator element may comprise at least one turn, loop or coil of wire.
[0601] The stimulator element may comprise a ring.
[0602] The stimulator element may be likened to a primary coil of a transformer and each of the
indicator elements may be likened to a different secondary coil of a transformer. The sensor
element may be likened to a tertiary coil which is coupled to a time-varying magnetic field of
the transformer for interrogation thereof.
[0603] The stimulator element may be coupled to one or more of the indicator elements
simultaneously.
[0604] The stimulator element may be coupled to one or more of the indicator elements
sequentially.
[0605] The stimulator element may be provided on the deployable tool.
[0606] The stimulator element may be electrically isolated from and, therefore, independent of
the sensor element.
[0607] This may at least partially isolate an electrical signal induced in the sensor element from
an electrical signal applied to the stimulator element. This may reduce electrical noise induced
in the sensor element, thereby improving measurement sensitivity.
[0608] Each indicator element may have a characteristic frequency response.
[0609] The characteristic frequency response may include a characteristic resonant feature.
[0610] The characteristic resonant feature may be a resonant peak or a resonant dip.
[0611] The characteristic resonant feature may occur at a characteristic resonant frequency.

                                                64
[0612] The controller may be capable of discriminating a characteristic frequency response of
one indicator element from a characteristic frequency response of a different indicator element.
[0613] The controller may be capable of discriminating a characteristic resonant feature of one
indicator element from a characteristic resonant feature of a different indicator element.
[0614] The stimulator element may comprise an electrical conductor which extends
circumferentially around the deployable tool.
[0615] The stimulator element may extend completely around the deployable tool. This may
enhance the strength of any coupling between the between the stimulator element and the
indicator elements. This may allow coupling between the stimulator element and the indicator
elements if the indicator elements are circumferentially non-continuous.
[0616] The stimulator element may extend part-way around the deployable tool.
[0617] The stimulator element may be arranged helically around the deployable tool.
[0618] The stimulator element may be arranged helically around a body portion of the
deployable tool. Such an orientation of the stimulator element may be accommodated on the
deployable tool without unduly increasing the radial extent of the deployable tool.
[0619] The stimulator element may be encapsulated in a potting compound. Encapsulation of
the stimulator element may provide protection for the stimulator element from an environment
surrounding the stimulator element.
[0620] The stimulator element may be housed within the sensor element enclosure.
[0621] The stimulator element may extend around an axis arranged radially relative to a
longitudinal axis of the downhole arrangement. Such an orientation of the stimulator element
may serve to enhance coupling of a magnetic field extending from the stimulator element to the
indicator elements of the downhole arrangement.
[0622] The stimulator element may be formed separately from the deployable tool and then
fitted around the deployable tool.

                                                  65
[0623] The stimulator element may be formed on a substrate.
[0624] The substrate may be generally planar.
[0625] The substrate may be electrically insulating.
[0626] The substrate may be flexible.
[0627] The substrate may be fitted around the deployable tool.
[0628] The substrate may be fitted around the base member of the stimulator element enclosure.
[0629] The use of a flexible substrate may allow the substrate to be fitted around, to adopt or to
comply with a non-planar geometry. For example, this may allow the substrate to be fitted
around, to adopt or to comply with the deployable tool or an outer surface of the base member of
the stimulator element enclosure.
[0630] The substrate may be rigid.
[0631] The stimulator element may be formed by printing, writing, depositing or otherwise
applying an electrically conductive material to the substrate.
[0632] The stimulator element may comprise an electrically conductive path or track defined on
the substrate.
[0633] The stimulator element may have a generally convoluted configuration.
[0634] The stimulator element may have a spiral configuration.
[0635] Each turn of the stimulator element may have a curvature which increases towards a
centre of the stimulator element.
[0636] Each turn of the stimulator element may comprise one or more straight sections. Each
turn, loop, coil or ring of the stimulator element may extend around a different axis, each axis
arranged along a different radial direction relative to a longitudinal axis of the deployable tool.

                                                  66
[0637] The stimulator element and the sensor element may be oriented orthogonally to one
another. For example, the sensor element may be arranged helically around a body portion of
the deployable tool. The stimulator element may extend around one or more axes which are
arranged radially relative to a longitudinal axis of the deployable tool. Each turn, loop, coil or
ring of the stimulator element may be elongated in an axial direction relative to a longitudinal
axis of the deployable tool.
[0638] Conversely, the stimulator element may be arranged helically around a body portion of
the deployable tool. The sensor element may extend around one or more axes which are
arranged radially relative to a longitudinal axis of the deployable tool. Each turn, loop, coil or
ring of the sensor element may be elongated in an axial direction relative to a longitudinal axis
of the deployable tool.
[0639] Such orthogonal arrangements of the stimulator and sensor elements may mean that the
electromagnetic field coupled from the stimulator element is generally orthogonally oriented
relative to an electromagnetic field coupled to the sensor element. This may reduce any cross
coupling of the magnetic field from the stimulator element directly to the sensor element. This
may reduce noise on the signal induced in the sensor element, thereby improving measurement
sensitivity.
[0640] The controller may be electrically connected to the stimulator element.
[0641] The controller may be configured to generate and apply an electrical signal to the
stimulator element.
[0642] The controller may be electrically connected to the sensor element.
[0643] The controller may be configured to measure an electrical signal existing on the sensor
element.
[0644] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling between the
stimulator element and the sensor element via the indicator elements from the measured
electrical signal.

                                                67
[0645] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling between the
stimulator element and the sensor element via the indicator elements according to a frequency
spectrum of the measured electrical signal.
[0646] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling between the
stimulator element and the sensor element via the indicator elements according to the shape of
the frequency spectrum of the measured electrical signal.
[0647] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling between the
stimulator element and the sensor element via the indicator elements according to a resonant
feature in the frequency spectrum of the measured electrical signal.
[0648] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling between the
stimulator element and the sensor element via the indicator elements according to a resonant
peak or dip in the frequency spectrum of the measured electrical signal.
[0649] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling between the
stimulator element and the sensor element via the indicator elements according to a shape or Q
factor of the resonant feature.
[0650] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling between the
stimulator element and the sensor element via the indicator elements according to a frequency of
the resonant feature.
[0651] The deployable tool may comprise a plurality of stimulator elements.
[0652] This may allow measurements of any coupling between different stimulator elements
and the sensor element via the indicator elements. This may improve accuracy and/or
confidence in the measurement of a degree of coupling between a stimulator element and the
sensor element via the indicator elements. A plurality of stimulator elements may also provide
one or more spare stimulator elements which may be relied upon in the event of failure of one of
the stimulator elements.
[0653] Each stimulator element of the plurality of stimulator elements may comprise one or
more of the features of which the stimulator element may comprise.

                                                  68
[0654] The plurality of stimulator elements may be electrically unconnected.
[0655] Each of the stimulator elements may be independently connected to the controller.
[0656] The downhole arrangement may be configurable between a first configuration in which
coupling between one or more of the indicator elements and the sensor element is prevented and
a second configuration in which coupling between one or more of the indicator elements and the
sensor element is permitted.
[0657] One or more of the indicator elements may be covered so as to prevent coupling of an
electromagnetic field provided by one or more of the indicator elements to the sensor element
when the downhole arrangement is in the first configuration. One or more of the indicator
elements may be accessible for coupling of an electromagnetic field to the sensor element when
the downhole arrangement is in the second configuration.
[0658] The downhole arrangement may be configurable between the first and second
configurations on actuation or de-actuation of the downhole arrangement. Thus, detection of a
change in a degree of coupling between one or more of the indicator elements to the sensor
element may provide a positive indication of a degree of actuation or a degree of de-actuation of
the downhole arrangement.
[0659] The downhole arrangement may comprise a plurality of further indicator elements for
providing an electromagnetic field which may be coupled to the sensor element.
[0660] The plurality of further indicator elements may comprise one or more of the features of
which the plurality of indicator elements may comprise. The further indicator elements may be
accessible for coupling with the sensor element regardless of a status of the downhole
arrangement. The presence of such further indicator elements may permit identification of the
downhole arrangement regardless of a state of the downhole arrangement.
[0661] The plurality of further indicator elements may be configured for location downhole of
the plurality of indicator elements. This may permit the sensor element of the deployable tool to
couple with the plurality of further indicator elements before it detects the plurality of indicator
elements as the deployable tool is pulled uphole from a position downhole of the plurality of
further indicator elements. If the plurality of further indicator elements are accessible for

                                                  69
coupling with the sensor element regardless of a status of the downhole arrangement, this may
permit the deployable tool to identify the downhole arrangement via coupling between the
plurality of further indicator elements and the sensor element and then check the degree of
actuation and/or de-actuation of the downhole arrangement via coupling between the plurality of
indicator elements and the sensor element.
[0662] According to an eighteenth aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for
use in determining the relative position of first and second parts of a downhole arrangement, the
method comprising:
        providing a distinct electromagnetic field from each indicator element of a plurality of
indicator elements, the plurality of indicator elements having a predetermined spatial
arrangement relative to the first part of the downhole arrangement;
        sensing respective electromagnetic fields coupled from each of the indicator elements to
a sensor element; and

electromagnetic fields from each of the indicator elements to the sensor element.
[0664] The method may comprise determining the relative position of the first and second parts
of the downhole arrangement from the determined degree of coupling of the respective
electromagnetic fields from each of the indicator elements to the sensor element.
[0665] The method may comprise selectively extending the second part of the downhole
arrangement between the sensor element and one or more of the indicator elements so as to
prevent coupling of the respective electromagnetic fields between one or more of the indicator
elements and the sensor element.
[0666] The method may comprise selectively removing the second part of the downhole
arrangement from between the sensor element and one or more of the indicator elements so as to
permit coupling of the respective electromagnetic fields between one or more of the indicator
elements and the sensor element.

                                                    70
[0667] The method may comprise moving or running the sensor element past the plurality of
indicator elements.
[0668] According to a nineteenth aspect of the present invention there is provided a system for
use in determining the relative position of first and second parts of a downhole arrangement, the
system comprising:
         a first indicator element fixed relative to a first part of the downhole arrangement, the
first indicator element being capable of providing a first electromagnetic field;

the second indicator element being capable of providing a second electromagnetic field which is
distinct from the first electromagnetic field; and
         a sensor arrangement which is capable of sensing and discriminating between the first
and second electromagnetic fields coupled from the first and second indicator elements.
[0669] Such a system may be beneficial for use in determining a degree to which a downhole

[0674] Such a system does not require any active electronics to be incorporated or embedded
into the downhole arrangement.
[0675] The downhole arrangement may comprise a downhole tool.
[0676] When used in conjunction with a downhole tool, the system may be beneficial for use in
measuring a degree of coupling between each indicator element and the sensor arrangement and
any changes arising therein on actuation and/or de-actuation of the downhole tool. Such a

                                                71
system may be used to provide positive confirmation of a state of the downhole tool before,
during and/or after actuation and/or de-actuation of the downhole tool. Such a system may be
used to provide positive confirmation of degree to which the downhole tool has been actuated or
de-actuated before, during and/or after actuation and/or de-actuation of the downhole tool.

extending from two or more of the indicator elements at the same time.

extending from two or more of the indicator elements at different times.
[0685] The sensor arrangement may comprise a plurality of sensor elements.
[0686] The plurality of sensor elements may be electrically unconnected.

[0701] The deployable tool may comprise the power source.
[0702] The downhole arrangement may comprise the power source.
[0703] The sensor arrangement may be separate from the downhole arrangement.
[0704] The downhole arrangement may define a throughbore.

[0716] The time-varying magnetic field may have a frequency in the range of 10 kHz to 1 MHz,
50 kHz to 500 kHz, or 100 kHz to 150 kHz.
[0717] Coupling of a magnetic field may be possible in such frequency ranges through any
wellbore fluids that may be present between the indicator elements and the sensor arrangement.
[0718] Each indicator element may have a characteristic frequency response.
[0719] The characteristic frequency response may include a characteristic resonant feature.
[0720] The characteristic resonant feature may be a resonant peak or a resonant dip.
[0721] The characteristic resonant feature may occur at a characteristic resonant frequency.

one indicator element from a characteristic frequency response of a different indicator element.

[0730] Each indicator element may comprise a capacitance.
[0731] Each indicator element may comprise a capacitance which is electrically connected
between two ends of the electrical conductor.

                                               75
[0732] Such an indicator element may provide a resonant frequency response.

[0735] Each indicator element may extend circumferentially around the throughbore of the
downhole arrangement.
[0736] Each indicator element may extend completely around the throughbore of the downhole
arrangement. This may enhance the strength of any coupling between the each indicator
element and the sensor arrangement. This may allow coupling between each indicator element
and the sensor arrangement if the sensor arrangement is circumferentially non-continuous.
[0737] Each indicator element may extend part-way around the throughbore of the downhole

[0746] The indicator element enclosure may comprise a generally tubular base member and a
generally tubular lid member. The base member and the lid member may define a generally
annular cavity therebetween. The radial extent of the annular cavity may be selected so as to
avoid coupling between the first and second indicator elements and a body portion of the
downhole arrangement. Such coupling may alter any coupling between the indicator elements

[0761] The use of one or more flexible substrates may allow the one or more substrates to be
fitted around, to adopt or to comply with a non-planar geometry. For example, this may allow
the one or more substrates to be fitted around, to adopt or to comply with the throughbore of the
downhole arrangement or an outer surface of the base member of the indicator element
enclosure.
[0762] Each indicator element may be formed by printing, writing, depositing or otherwise
applying an electrically conductive material to a substrate. Thus, each indicator element may be
formed using a relatively inexpensive manufacturing technique.

a substrate.

                                               80
[0798] The sensor arrangement may comprise an electrical conductor which extends
circumferentially around the deployable tool.
[0799] The sensor arrangement may extend completely around the deployable tool. This may
enhance the strength of any coupling between the between the indicator elements and the sensor
arrangement. This may allow coupling between the indicator elements and the sensor
arrangement if the indicator elements are circumferentially non-continuous.
[0800] The sensor arrangement may extend part-way around the deployable tool.
[0801] The sensor arrangement may be arranged helically around the deployable tool.

[0811] Each sensor element may be coupled to one or more of the indicator elements
sequentially.
[0812] Each sensor element may be provided on the deployable tool.
[0813] The sensor elements may be circumferentially distributed around the deployable tool.
[0814] The sensor elements may have a uniform circumferential distribution around the
deployable tool.
[0815] The controller may be configured to determine the position of the first indicator element
with respect to the plurality of sensor elements from the electromagnetic field coupled to each of
the sensor elements from the first indicator element.
[0816] The controller may be configured to determine the position of the second indicator with
respect to the plurality of sensor elements from the electromagnetic field coupled to each of the
sensor elements from the second indicator element.
[0817] The controller may be configured to determine a relative position of the first and second
parts of the downhole arrangement from each of the determined positions of the first and second

                                                  82
[0825] The use of a flexible substrate may allow the substrate to be fitted around, to adopt or to
comply with a non-planar geometry. For example, this may allow the substrate to be fitted
around, to adopt or to comply with the deployable tool or an outer surface of the base member of
the sensor arrangement enclosure.

arranged along a different radial direction relative to a longitudinal axis of the deployable tool.
[0833] The sensor arrangement may be encapsulated in a potting compound. Encapsulation of
the sensor arrangement may provide protection for the sensor arrangement from an environment
surrounding the sensor arrangement.
[0834] The deployable tool may comprise a sensor arrangement enclosure.
[0835] The sensor arrangement may be housed within the sensor arrangement enclosure.
[0836] The sensor arrangement enclosure may be filled with the potting compound. Filling the

arrangement enclosure and provide enhanced environmental and mechanical protection for the
sensor arrangement.
[0837] The potting compound may comprise an epoxy or an elastomeric compound.
[0838] The sensor arrangement enclosure may comprise a generally tubular base member and a
generally tubular lid member.
[0839] The sensor elements may be wrapped around the base member.
[0840] At least the lid member of the sensor arrangement enclosure may be transparent to a

[0851] The plurality of stimulator elements may have a fixed spatial arrangement.
[0852] Each stimulator element may be likened to a primary coil of a transformer and each of
the indicator elements may be likened to a different secondary coil of a transformer. The sensor
arrangement may be likened to a tertiary coil which is coupled to a time-varying magnetic field
of the transformer for interrogation thereof.
[0853] Each stimulator element may be coupled to one or more of the indicator elements
simultaneously.
[0854] Each stimulator element may be coupled to one or more of the indicator elements
sequentially.
[0855] Each stimulator element may be provided on the deployable tool.
[0856] Each stimulator element may be electrically independent of the sensor arrangement.
[0857] This may at least partially isolate an electrical signal induced in the sensor arrangement
from electrical signals applied to the stimulator elements. This may reduce electrical noise
induced in the sensor arrangement, thereby improving measurement sensitivity.
[0858] The stimulator elements may be circumferentially distributed around the deployable tool.
[0859] The stimulator elements may have a uniform circumferential distribution around the
deployable tool.
[0860] The controller may be configured to determine the position of the first indicator with
respect to the plurality of stimulator elements from the electromagnetic field coupled to the
sensor arrangement from the first indicator element for each stimulator element.

[0862] The controller may be configured to determine a relative position of the first and second
parts of the downhole arrangement from each of the determined positions of the first and second
indicators with respect to the plurality of stimulator elements.
[0863] Each of the stimulator elements may comprise an electrical conductor which extends
circumferentially around the deployable tool.
[0864] Each of the stimulator elements may extend completely around the deployable tool. This
may enhance the strength of any coupling between the between each stimulator element and the
first and/or second indicator elements. This may allow coupling between each stimulator
element and the first and/or second indicator elements if the first and/or second indicator
elements are circumferentially non-continuous.
[0865] Each of the stimulator elements may extend part-way around the deployable tool.
[0866] Each of the stimulator elements may be arranged helically around the deployable tool.
[0867] Each of the stimulator elements may be arranged helically around a body portion of the
deployable tool. Such an orientation of the stimulator elements may be accommodated on the
deployable tool without unduly increasing the radial extent of the deployable tool.
[0868] Each of the stimulator elements may be encapsulated in a potting compound.
Encapsulation of the stimulator elements may provide protection for the stimulator elements
from an environment surrounding the stimulator element.
[0869] Each of the stimulator elements may be housed within the sensor arrangement enclosure.
[0870] The stimulator elements may extend around an axis arranged radially relative to a
longitudinal axis of the downhole arrangement. Such an orientation of the stimulator elements
may serve to enhance coupling of a respective magnetic field extending from each of the
stimulator elements to the indicator elements of the downhole arrangement.
[0871] The stimulator elements may be formed separately from the deployable tool and then
fitted around the deployable tool.

                                                  86
[0872] The stimulator elements may be formed on a substrate.
[0873] The substrate may be generally planar.
[0874] The substrate may be electrically insulating.
[0875] The substrate may be flexible.
[0876] The substrate may be fitted around the deployable tool.
[0877] The substrate may be fitted around the base member of the stimulator element enclosure.
[0878] The use of a flexible substrate may allow the substrate to be fitted around, to adopt or to
comply with a non-planar geometry. For example, this may allow the substrate to be fitted
around, to adopt or to comply with the deployable tool or an outer surface of the base member of
the stimulator element enclosure.
[0879] The substrate may be rigid.
[0880] Each of the stimulator elements may be formed by printing, writing, depositing or
otherwise applying an electrically conductive material to the substrate.
[0881] Each of the stimulator elements may comprise an electrically conductive path or track
defined on the substrate.
[0882] Each of the stimulator elements may have a generally convoluted configuration.
[0883] Each of the stimulator elements may have a spiral configuration.
[0884] Each turn of each stimulator element may have a curvature which increases towards a
centre of the stimulator element.
[0885] Each turn of each stimulator element may comprise one or more straight sections. Each
turn, loop, coil or ring of each stimulator element may extend around a different axis, each axis
arranged along a different radial direction relative to a longitudinal axis of the deployable tool.

                                                  87
[0886] The stimulator arrangement may be oriented orthogonally to the sensor arrangement.
For example, the sensor arrangement may be arranged helically around a body portion of the
deployable tool. The stimulator arrangement may extend around one or more axes which are
arranged radially relative to a longitudinal axis of the deployable tool. Each turn, loop, coil or
ring of the stimulator arrangement may be elongated in an axial direction relative to a
longitudinal axis of the deployable tool.
[0887] Conversely, the stimulator arrangement may be arranged helically around a body portion
of the deployable tool. The sensor arrangement may extend around one or more axes which are
arranged radially relative to a longitudinal axis of the deployable tool. Each turn, loop, coil or
ring of the sensor arrangement may be elongated in an axial direction relative to a longitudinal
axis of the deployable tool.
[0888] Such orthogonal arrangements of the stimulator and sensor arrangements may mean that
the electromagnetic field coupled from the stimulator arrangement is generally orthogonally
oriented relative to an electromagnetic field coupled to the sensor arrangement. This may
reduce any cross-coupling of the magnetic field from the stimulator arrangement directly to the
sensor arrangement. This may reduce noise on the signal induced in the sensor arrangement,
thereby improving measurement sensitivity.
[0889] The controller may be electrically connected to each of the stimulator elements.
[0890] The controller may be configured to generate and apply an electrical signal to each of the
stimulator elements.
[0891] The controller may be configured to generate and apply an electrical signal to each of the
stimulator elements one at a time.
[0892] The controller may be configured to measure an electrical signal existing on the sensor
arrangement when stimulating the indicator elements using each of the stimulator elements.
[0893] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling between the
stimulator arrangement and the sensor arrangement via the indicator elements from the
measured electrical signal.

                                                88
[0894] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling between the
stimulator arrangement and the sensor arrangement via the indicator elements according to a
frequency spectrum of the measured electrical signal.
[0895] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling between the
stimulator arrangement and the sensor arrangement via the indicator elements according to the
shape of the frequency spectrum of the measured electrical signal.
[0896] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling between the
stimulator arrangement and the sensor arrangement via the indicator elements according to a
resonant feature in the frequency spectrum of the measured electrical signal.
[0897] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling between the
stimulator arrangement and the sensor arrangement via the indicator elements according to a
resonant peak or dip in the frequency spectrum of the measured electrical signal.
[0898] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling between the
stimulator arrangement and the sensor arrangement via the indicator elements according to a
shape or Q-factor of the resonant feature.
[0899] The controller may be configured to determine a degree of coupling between the
stimulator arrangement and the sensor arrangement via the indicator elements according to a
frequency of the resonant feature.
[0900] The downhole arrangement may comprise a plurality of further indicator elements for
providing an electromagnetic field which may be coupled to the sensor arrangement.
[0901] The plurality of further indicator elements may comprise one or more of the features of
which the plurality of indicator elements may comprise. The further indicator elements may be
accessible for coupling with the sensor arrangement regardless of a status of the downhole
arrangement. The presence of such further indicator elements may permit identification of the
downhole arrangement regardless of the state of the downhole arrangement.
[0902] The plurality of further indicator elements may be configured for location downhole of
the plurality of indicator elements. This may permit the sensor arrangement of the deployable

                                                  89
tool to couple with the plurality of further indicator elements before it detects the plurality of
indicator elements as the deployable tool is pulled uphole from a position downhole of the
plurality of further indicator elements. If the plurality of further indicator elements are
accessible for coupling with the sensor arrangement regardless of a status of the downhole
arrangement, this may permit the deployable tool to identify the downhole arrangement via
coupling between the plurality of further indicator elements and the sensor arrangement and then
check the degree of actuation and/or de-actuation of the downhole arrangement via coupling
between the plurality of indicator elements and the sensor arrangement.
[0903] According to a twentieth aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for
use in determining the relative position of first and second parts of a downhole arrangement, the
method comprising:
        coupling a first electromagnetic field from a first indicator element to a sensor
arrangement, the first indicator element being fixed relative to a first part of the downhole
arrangement;
        coupling a second electromagnetic field from a second indicator element to the sensor
arrangement, the second electromagnetic field being distinct from the first electromagnetic field,
and the second indicator element being fixed relative to a second part of the downhole
arrangement; and
        using the sensor arrangement to sense and discriminate between the first and second
electromagnetic fields.
[0904] The method may comprise determining a degree of coupling of the first and second
electromagnetic fields to the sensor arrangement.
[0905] The method may comprise determining the relative position of the first and second parts
of the downhole arrangement from the determined degree of coupling of the first and second
electromagnetic fields to the sensor arrangement.
[0906] The method may comprise selectively moving the first and second parts of the downhole
arrangement relative to one another so as to change the first and second electromagnetic fields
coupled to the sensor arrangement.
[0907] The method may comprise moving or running the sensor arrangement past the first and
second indicator elements.

Description of Embodiments
[0939] Terms such as "up", "down", "upward", "downward", "uphole", "downhole" and the
like are used in the following description of the drawings for ease of illustration only. One
skilled in the art will understand that such terms are intended to refer to the particular orientation
of the features shown in drawings, but are not intended to be limiting. For example, terms such
as "up", "upward" and "uphole" may be used to refer to a direction along a borehole towards a

                                                   93
point of entry of the borehole into the ground or the seabed, whilst terms such as "down",
"downward" and "downhole" may be used to refer to a direction along a borehole away from
the point of entry. As such, when a borehole is deviated from the vertical or is horizontal, such
terms may refer to a direction which differs significantly from a vertical direction and may even
refer to a horizontal direction.
[0940] Referring initially to Figure 1(a) there is shown a system for downhole detection
generally designated 10 installed within a wellbore 12. The wellbore 12 may comprise a
borehole wall of an open hole section of an oil or gas well or may comprise a liner or a casing
installed within an oil or gas well. The system 10 comprises a deployable tool in the form of a
shifting tool generally designated 14 deployed within a through bore 16 of a downhole
arrangement in the form of a downhole tool generally designated 18. The downhole tool 18 may
be configured for at least one of injection, stimulation, fracturing and production. It should,
however, be understood that the system 10 of Figure 1(a) is not limited to use in such downhole
operations, but may be used in other downhole operations.
[0941] The shifting tool 14 comprises a generally tubular body 20, a primary element in the
form of an electrically insulated primary coil 22 housed within a generally annular primary
enclosure 23, a controller 24 and a power source 26. The power source 26 is connected to the
controller 24 for the provision of power thereto. The controller 24 is connected to the primary
coil 22 for the application of an electrical signal thereto as will be described in more detail
below.
[0942] The downhole tool 18 comprises a generally tubular body 30 which defines the through
bore 16, a cover sleeve 32 which is slideable relative to the tubular body 30, and a secondary
element 33 which includes an electrically insulated secondary coil 34 and a capacitor which is
described in more detail with reference to Figure 3 below. The secondary element 33 is housed
within a generally annular secondary enclosure 35. The cover sleeve 32 is arranged radially
inwardly of the secondary element 33 relative to a longitudinal axis 36 of the downhole tool 18.
The downhole tool 18 is configured so that the cover sleeve 32 slides relative to the tubular body
30 of the downhole tool 18 in response to actuation of the downhole tool 18.
[0943] Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the primary coil 22 housed within the primary enclosure 23.
The primary enclosure 23 is formed from a polyether ether ketone (PEEK) material. The

                                                  94
primary enclosure 23 comprises a generally tubular base member 40 and a tubular lid member
42. The base member 40 defines an annular recess 44 in an outer surface 48 thereof. The
primary coil 22 is wrapped around the base member 40 within the recess 42. The lid member 42
is configured to fit around the outer surface 48 of the base member 40 so as to define an annular
cavity 49 which encloses the primary coil 22. The cavity 49 is filled with the epoxy potting
compound (not shown) so as to encapsulate the primary coil 22 thereby providing mechanical
support to the primary enclosure 23 and enhancing the environmental protection provided by the
primary enclosure 23 to the primary coil 22.
[0944] Figure 3 shows the secondary coil 34 housed within the secondary enclosure 35. The
secondary enclosure 35 is formed from a polyether ether ketone (PEEK) material. The
secondary enclosure 35 comprises a generally tubular base member 50 and a tubular lid member
52 which co-operate so as to define a generally annular cavity 54. The secondary coil 34 is
wrapped around the base member 50 within the cavity 54. The secondary enclosure 35 is
configured so as to provide a radial separation between the secondary coil 34 and an outer
surface 55 of the lid member 52. Such a radial separation may serve to reduce any
electromagnetic coupling between the secondary coil 34 and the body 30 of the downhole tool
18. The two ends of the electrically conductive core of the secondary coil 34 are electrically
connected to the capacitor 56 of the secondary element 33. The cavity 54 is filled with the
epoxy potting compound (not shown) so as to encapsulate the secondary coil 34 and the
capacitor 56 thereby providing mechanical support to the secondary enclosure 35 and enhancing
the environmental protection provided by the secondary enclosure 35 to the secondary coil 34
and the capacitor 56.
[0945] In use, the shifting tool 14 is deployed downwardly through the through bore 16 defined
by the downhole tool 18 until the shifting tool 14 is located downhole from the downhole tool
18. The controller 24 generates and applies an alternating current (AC) electrical signal to the
primary coil 22 and measures an electrical signal existing on the primary coil 22. The controller
24 repeatedly sweeps the frequency of the applied electrical signal from 100 kHz to 150 kHz as
shown in the uppermost traces in Figures 4(a) and 4(b) and monitors the measured electrical
signal as the shifting tool 14 is pulled uphole from a position in which the primary coil 22 is
located downhole from the secondary coil 34.

                                                  95
[0946] Prior to actuation of the downhole tool 18 as shown in Figure 1(a), the cover sleeve 32
extends between the secondary coil 34 and the longitudinal axis 36 so as to cover the secondary
coil 34. Accordingly, inductive coupling between the primary and secondary coils 22, 34 is
prevented by the cover sleeve 32 prior to actuation of the downhole tool 18. The corresponding
measured electrical signal in the absence of any electromagnetic coupling between the primary
and secondary coils 22, 34 is shown in the middle trace in Figure 4(a) as a function of time and
the corresponding envelope of the measured electrical signal as a function of time is shown in
the lowermost trace of Figure 4(a). Since the frequency is proportional to time within any given
frequency sweep period, one skilled in the art will understand that the electrical signal shown in
the lowermost trace of Figure 4(a) is representative of a magnitude frequency spectrum of the
electrical signal.
[0947] As shown in Figure 4(a), the measured electrical signal in the absence of any inductive
coupling between the primary and secondary coils 22, 34 generally decreases as the frequency
of the applied electrical signal is swept from 100 kHz to 150 kHz. The controller 24 is
configured to interpret detection of such a measured electrical signal as an indication that the
downhole tool 18 is in a de-actuated state.
[0948] After actuation of the downhole tool 18 as shown in Figure 1(b), the cover sleeve 32 is
withdrawn from between the secondary coil 34 and the longitudinal axis 36 so as to reveal or
provide access to the secondary coil 34 from the throughbore 16. Accordingly, after actuation
of the downhole tool 18 inductive coupling between the primary and secondary coils 22, 34 may
occur when the primary and secondary coils 22, 34 are axially aligned as shown in Figure 1(b).
This results in the induction of an alternating current in the secondary coil 34. This in turn
modifies the electrical signal existing on the primary coil 22. The electrical signal measured on
the primary coil when the primary and secondary coils 22, 34 are inductively coupled is shown
in the middle trace of Figure 4(b) as a function of time and the corresponding envelope of the
measured electrical signal as a function of time is shown in the lower trace of Figure 4(b).
[0949] As for Figure 4(a), since the frequency is proportional to time within any given
frequency sweep period, one skilled in the art will understand that the electrical signal shown in
the lowermost trace of Figure 4(b) is representative of a magnitude frequency spectrum of the
electrical signal.

                                                   96
[0950] As shown in Figure 4(b), the envelope of the measured electrical signal when the
primary and secondary coils 22, 34 are inductively coupled displays a resonant peak close to a
frequency of 125 kHz at the centre of the swept frequency range of 100 kHz to 150 kHz. The
controller 24 is configured to interpret detection of such a resonant peak in the envelope of the
measured electrical signal as an indication that the downhole tool 18 is in an actuated state.
[0951] In view of the foregoing description, the system 10 may be used to determine the status
of the downhole tool 18. The controller 24 may log the determined status of the downhole tool
18 for analysis after recovery of the shifting tool 14 to surface. Additionally or alternatively, the
controller 24 may comprise a transmitter (not shown) for transmission of the determined status
to a surface receiver, for example via an electric line which connects the shifting tool 14 to
surface.
[0952] With reference now to Figure 5, there is shown an alternative system for downhole
detection generally designated 110. The system 110 and the system 10 comprise many like
features, and, as such, like features are identified with like reference numerals. The system 110
comprises a deployable tool in the form of a shifting tool generally designated 114 deployed
within a through bore 116 of a downhole arrangement in the form of a downhole tool generally
designated 118. The shifting tool 114 comprises a generally tubular body 120, a primary
element in the form of a primary coil 122 housed within a generally annular primary enclosure
123, a controller 124 and a power source 126. The power source 126 is connected to the
controller 124 for the provision of power thereto. The controller 124 is connected to the primary
coil 122 for the application of an electrical signal thereto as will be described in more detail
below.
[0953] The downhole tool 118 comprises a generally tubular body 130 which defines the
through bore 116, a cover sleeve 132 which is slideable relative to the tubular body 130, and a
secondary element 133 which includes an electrically insulated secondary coil 134 and a
capacitor (not shown) housed within a generally annular secondary enclosure 135. The cover
sleeve 132 is arranged radially inwardly of the secondary coil 134 relative to a longitudinal axis
136 of the downhole tool 118. The downhole tool 118 is configured so that the cover sleeve 132
slides relative to the tubular body 130 of the downhole tool 118 in response to actuation of the
downhole tool 118.

                                                    97
[0954] Unlike the downhole tool 18, the downhole tool 118 comprises a plurality of further
secondary elements in the form of a plurality of rings or a ring arrangement generally designated
170. The ring arrangement 170 is located downhole of the secondary coil 134 as shown in detail
in Figure 6(a). Each ring of the ring arrangement 170 has a first data configuration, a second
data configuration or a checking configuration. In Figure 6(a), rings configured according to the
first data configuration are identified by reference numeral 172, rings configured according to
the second data configuration are identified by reference numeral 174 and rings configured
according to the checking configuration are identified by reference numeral 176. The rings 172,
174 and 176 have the same inner diameter. The rings 172, 174 and 176 have the same outer
diameter.
[0955] Rings 172, 174 of the first and second data configurations are formed from steel. A
checking ring 176 is formed from an electrically insulating material such as PEEK and or an
elastomeric material. Rings 172 of the first data configuration have an axial extent which is
twice the axial extent of the rings 174 of the second data configuration. The checking rings 176
have the same axial extent as the rings of the second data configuration 174.
[0956] The ring arrangement 170 comprises a first axially outer series of rings 180 at a
downhole end 182 of the ring arrangement 170, a second axially outer series of rings 184 at an
uphole end 186 of the ring arrangement 170, and an axially inner series of rings 188 located
axially intermediate the first and second axially outer series of rings 180, 184. In order of
appearance from the downhole end 182 of the ring arrangement 170, the first axially outer series
of rings 180 comprises a ring 174, a ring 172 and a ring 174. As will be described in more
detail below, the first axially outer series of rings 180 may serve to indicate a start or downhole
end of the axially inner series of rings 188.
[0957] In the axially inner series of rings 188, alternate rings are checking rings 176 and each
checking ring 176 is intermediate a ring 172 or a ring 174. As will be described in more detail
below, the rings 172, 174 of the axially inner series of rings 188 define a binary code.
[0958] In order of appearance from the downhole end 182 of the ring arrangement 170, the
second axially outer series of rings 184 comprises a ring 172, a ring 174 and a ring 172. As will
be described in more detail below, the second axially outer series of rings 184 may serve to
indicate an uphole end of the axially inner series of rings 188.

                                                   98
[0959] In use, the controller 124 generates and applies an alternating current (AC) electrical
signal to the primary coil 122 and measures an electrical signal existing on the primary coil 122.
The controller 124 repeatedly sweeps the frequency of the applied electrical signal from 100
kHz to 150 kHz and monitors the measured electrical signal as the shifting tool 114 is pulled
uphole from a position in which the primary coil 122 is located downhole from the ring
arrangement 170.
[0960] As the primary coil 122 passes the ring arrangement 170, the controller 124 repeatedly
measures a magnitude frequency spectrum of the measured electrical signal. The magnitude
frequency spectrum of the measured electrical signal varies according to any inductive coupling
between the primary coil 122 and each ring 172, 174 and 176 of the ring arrangement 170. The
first data configuration, the second data configuration and the checking configuration are
designed such that rings configured according to different configurations provide different
characteristic frequency spectra. The different characteristic frequency spectra may, for
example, differ in shape. The different characteristic frequency spectra may have different
spectral features. The different spectral features may, for example, have a different frequency.
The different characteristic frequency spectra may have different resonant features. The
different characteristic frequency spectra may have resonant features of a different shape. The
different characteristic frequency spectra may have resonant features having a different Q-factor
or the like.
[0961] The controller 124 is configured so as to identify the characteristic frequency spectrum
of a ring 172 as a first binary symbol or a '1', and to identify the characteristic frequency
spectrum of a ring 174 as a second binary symbol or a '0'. As the primary coil 122 passes the
first axially outer series of rings 180, the controller 124 detects a code of '010'. The controller
124 treats the subsequent frequency spectra of the measured electrical signal for each of the
rings of the axially inner series of rings 188 as symbols of a code until the primary coil 122
passes the second axially outer series of rings 184 and the controller 124 detects a code of '101'.
The repeated appearance of a checking ring 176 enables the controller 124 to perform a
checking function in which the series of frequency spectra of the measured electrical signal is
checked to ascertain whether the frequency spectrum of the measured electrical signal
corresponding to the checking rings 176 is detected in the correct repeating sequence. This may
permit a series of readings obtained while the primary coil 122 is stationary relative to the ring

                                                 99
arrangement 170 to be distinguished from a series of readings obtained as the primary coil 122
is run past the ring arrangement 170.
[0962] The code defined by the rings of the axially inner series of rings 188 may define a unique
identification number for the downhole tool 118. Once the controller 124 has determined the
code defined by the rings of the axially inner series of rings 188, the controller 124 may actuate
the downhole tool 118. The secondary coil 134 may subsequently be used to determine whether
the downhole tool 118 has been successfully actuated. Additionally or alternatively, the
controller 124 may log the determined code or transmit the same to a surface receiver (not
shown). Additionally or alternatively, the controller 124 may be configured to receive a
command from a surface transmitter (not shown) for actuating the downhole tool depending on
the code transmitted to the surface receiver (not shown).
[0963] An alternative plurality of further secondary elements in the form of a plurality of rings
or a ring arrangement 270 is shown Figure 6(b). The ring arrangement 270 of Figure 6(b) shares
many like features with the ring arrangement 170 of Figure 6(a) and, as such, like features share
like reference numerals. Each ring of the ring arrangement 270 has a first data configuration, a
second data configuration or a checking configuration. In Figure 6(b), rings configured
according to the first data configuration are identified by reference numeral 272, rings
configured according to the second data configuration are identified by reference numeral 274
and rings configured according to the checking configuration are identified by reference
numeral 276. The rings 272, 274 and 276 have the same axial extent and the same outer
diameter, but different inner diameters. The difference in inner diameter of the different
configurations of rings 272, 274 and 276 means that the controller 124 measures a different
characteristic frequency spectrum of the measured electrical signal for each different
configuration.
[0964] A second alternative plurality of further secondary elements 370 is shown in Figure 7(a).
Each further secondary element comprises a corresponding coil of insulated wire 371 - 378
which is arranged circumferentially around a further base member 150 of a type similar to the
base member 50 of the secondary enclosure 35 shown in Figure 3. Each further secondary
element further comprises a corresponding capacitor (not shown) electrically connected between
the ends of each wire 371 - 378. Each further secondary element of the second alternative
plurality of further secondary elements 370 is configured such that electromagnetic coupling

                                                  100
between the primary element 122 and each further secondary element provides a corresponding
measured electrical signal having a characteristic frequency spectrum. In other words, each
further secondary element may be configured so as to have a characteristic frequency response.
In particular, each further secondary element may be configured so as to have a characteristic
resonant feature at a corresponding resonant frequency fl - f8.
[0965] The particular combination of resonant frequencies fl - f8 may define a number or code
such as a unique identification code for the downhole tool 118. The resonant frequencies fl - f8
may together define a finite set of eight frequencies. The detection of one of the resonant
frequencies fl - f8 is indicative of the presence of the corresponding coil of insulated wire 371
378 and may be taken to represent a first binary symbol or a '1'. The absence of one of the
resonant frequencies fl - f8 is indicative of the absence of the corresponding coil of insulated
wire 371 - 378 and may be taken to represent a second binary symbol or a '0'. Each resonant
frequency may represent a different binary digit of an eight digit binary number permitting
decimal numbers from 0 to 255 to be encoded. In principle, therefore, the use of eight further
secondary elements may permit up to 256 downhole tools to be identified in a completion string.
[0966] In practice, it may be necessary to dedicate one or more of the resonant frequencies fl
f8 or to use additional further secondary elements for checking purposes. For example, an
identically configured further secondary element or checking element may be used for every
downhole tool in a workstring so that detection of a downhole tool can be positively verified
before the downhole tool in question is identified. The use of a checking element in this way
may serve to at least partially reduce the risk of any false readings. The use multiple checking
elements, for example, checking elements at either end of the plurality of further secondary
elements of every downhole tool may further reduce the risk of any false readings. The use of
checking elements at either end of the plurality of further secondary elements of every downhole
tool may also permit correction for changes in downhole conditions such as downhole
temperature and pressure which might cause the resonant frequencies fl - f8 to shift.
[0967] Although the coils of wire 371 - 378 are shown in Figure 7(a) as being axially separated,
one skilled in the art will appreciate that the separation of the coils of wire 371 - 378 may be
greater or less than that shown in Figure 7(a) and may even be zero so that the coils of wire 371
- 378 are all located at the same axial position.

                                                   101
[0968] A third alternative plurality of further secondary elements 470 is shown in Figure 7(b).
Each further secondary element comprises a corresponding coil of insulated wire 471 - 478
arranged around a different radial direction relative to a longitudinal axis 136 of the downhole
tool 118. Each further secondary element further comprises a corresponding capacitor (not
shown) electrically connected between the ends of each wire 471 - 478. The coils of insulated
wire 471 - 478 are circumferentially distributed around a further base member 150 of a type
similar to the base member 50 of the secondary enclosure 35 shown in Figure 3. The third
alternative plurality of further secondary elements 470 of Figure 7(b) may be more easily
manufactured than the second alternative plurality of further secondary elements 370 of Figure
7(a) because each coil of wire 471 - 478 may be wound or otherwise formed separately from the
base member 150 of the secondary enclosure 135 and then mounted on or attached to the base
member 150.
[0969] Each further secondary element of the third alternative plurality of further secondary
elements 470 is configured such that electromagnetic coupling between the primary element 122
and each further secondary element provides a corresponding measured electrical signal having
a characteristic frequency spectrum. In other words, each further secondary element may be
configured so as to have a characteristic frequency response. In particular, each further
secondary element may be configured so as to have a characteristic resonant feature at a
corresponding resonant frequency fl - f8. The particular combination of resonant frequencies
fl - f8 may define a number or code such as a unique identification code for the downhole tool
118.
[0970] A fourth alternative plurality of further secondary elements 570 is shown in Figures 8(a)
and 8(b) before the further secondary elements 570 are mounted around a further base member
(not shown). Each further secondary element comprises a corresponding insulated conductor
571 - 578 which defines a generally spiral path on a first surface 590 of an electrically
insulating substrate 592.
[0971] The spiral path of each conductor 571 - 578 extends from a first end 594 located in the
vicinity of a centre of the spiral path to an electrically conductive pad 596 located at a second
end. The first end 594 of the conductor 575 is electrically connected by a through conductor
597 which extends through the substrate 592 to an electrically conductive back-plane 598 on a
second surface 599 of the substrate 592. The pad 596 and the back-plane 598 may together

                                                  102
define a capacitor which is connected between the first and second ends of each conductor 571
578. Such a capacitor may be more robust and may, therefore, be less prone to failure in a
hostile downhole environment compared with a surface mount capacitor. Alternatively,
depending on the environmental conditions, a surface mount capacitor may be used as this may
avoid the need for the through conductor 597 or the back-plane 598.
[0972] Moreover, the conductors 571 - 578, the pad 596 and the back-plane 598 may be formed
by printing, painting, depositing or otherwise applying an electrically conductive material to a
planar substrate. This may not only improve control of the manufacturing process and therefore
enhance the accuracy of the resonant frequency for each further secondary element, but this may
also simplify the manufacturing process and reduce manufacturing costs.
[0973] The substrate 592 may be sufficiently flexible to permit the substrate 592 and the
plurality of further secondary elements 570 defined thereon to be mounted together around a
base member (not shown) of a secondary enclosure (not shown) so that each conductor 571
578 is arranged around a different radial direction relative to a longitudinal axis 136 of the
downhole tool 118.
[0974] Alternatively, if the substrate 592 is rigid or is not sufficiently flexible, then the plurality
of further secondary elements 570 may be diced and mounted separately around a further base
member (not shown) of a type similar to the base member 50 of the secondary enclosure 35
shown in Figure 3 so that each conductor 571 - 578 is arranged around a different radial
direction relative to a longitudinal axis 136 of the downhole tool 118.
[0975] Once mounted around the further base member, a cover or sleeve is fitted over the
further base member to define a further secondary enclosure (not shown) similar to the
secondary enclosure 35 shown in Figure 3. The further secondary enclosure is filled with an
epoxy potting compound (not shown) so as to encapsulate the further secondary elements 570
defined on the substrate 592 thereby providing mechanical support to the further secondary
enclosure and enhancing the environmental protection provided by the further secondary
enclosure to the further secondary elements 570.
[0976] The spiral path of each conductor 571 - 578 and the pad 596 of each conductor are
configured such that electromagnetic coupling between the primary element 122 and each
further secondary element provides a corresponding measured electrical signal having a

                                                 103
characteristic frequency spectrum. In other words, each further secondary element may be
configured so as to have a characteristic frequency response. In particular, each further
secondary element of the fourth alternative plurality of further secondary elements 570 may be
configured so as to have a characteristic resonant feature at a corresponding resonant frequency
fl - f8.
[0977] Regardless of which plurality of further secondary elements 370, 470 or 570 is used, the
characteristic frequency spectrum of one or more of the further secondary elements may be
selectively and irreversibly altered by selectively exposing one or more of the further secondary
elements to an electromagnetic field of sufficient strength. Such an electromagnetic field may
be used to selectively fuse, melt, burn, and/or break an electrical conductor of one or more of the
further secondary elements. The one or more of the further secondary elements may be
configured for this purpose. For example, the resistivity and/or cross-section of the electrical
conductor of the one or more further secondary elements may be selected to fuse, melt, burn,
and/or break for electromagnetic field strengths in excess of a predetermined threshold
electromagnetic field strength.
[0978] Depending on the strength of the electromagnetic field, the characteristic resonant
feature may be irreversibly altered, for example irreversibly suppressed or eliminated. This may
be used to irreversibly alter a code defined by the resonant frequencies fl - f8 of any of the
plurality of further secondary elements 370, 470 or 570.
[0979] Figure 9 shows a primary and tertiary element arrangement 630 comprising a primary
element 622 and a tertiary element 625 for use in the system 10 of Figures 1(a) and 1(b) or the
system 110 of Figures 5(a) - 5(c).
[0980] The tertiary element 625 is circumferentially or helically wound around a generally
tubular base member 640 and is electrically insulated from the primary element 622.
[0981] The primary element 622 comprises a plurality of primary coils 622a, 622b, 622c etc
connected electrically in series. Each primary coil 622a, 622b, 622c etc extends around a
corresponding axis, each axis arranged along a different radial direction relative to a
longitudinal axis 636 of a downhole tool (not shown). Each primary coil 622a, 622b, 622c etc is
elongated in a direction along the longitudinal axis 636. The primary coils 622a, 622b, 622c etc
are mounted on the base member 640 of a primary enclosure (not shown) of a type similar to the

                                                  104
primary enclosure 23 shown in Figure 2. The primary enclosure is subsequently mounted on the
shifting tool 114.
[0982] Since the primary coils 622a, 622b, 622c etc are connected electrically in series, when an
electrical current is applied to the primary coils 622a, 622b, 622c etc, all of the primary coils
622a, 622b, 622c etc generate respective electromagnetic fields at the same time. One skilled in
the art will appreciate that when used with one of the further secondary elements of Figure 7(b)
or Figures 8(a) and 8(b), it may be advantageous for the axial extent of the primary coils 622a,
622b, 622c etc to be greater or equal to the axial extent of the coils 471 - 478 or the conductors
571 - 578 for improved electromagnetic coupling therebetween. Moreover, the angular
separation of the primary coils 622a, 622b, 622c etc around the circumference of the base
member 640 upon which the primary coils 622a, 622b, 622c etc are mounted should be selected
according to the angular separation of the different conductors of the further secondary elements
of Figure 7(b) or of Figures 8(a) and 8(b) so as to avoid the possibility of reduced
electromagnetic coupling when the primary coils and the further secondary elements are
rotationally misaligned.
[0983] In use, a controller (not shown in Figure 9) such as controller 124 of Figures 5(a) - 5(c)
generates and applies an alternating current (AC) to the primary element 622 on the shifting tool
114 which produces an AC electromagnetic field. When the primary element 622 is
electromagnetically coupled to further secondary elements (for example, the coils 471 - 478 of
Figure 7(b) or the conductors 571 - 578 of Figures 8(a) and 8(b) of the downhole tool 118), an
AC current is induced in the further secondary elements 471 - 478, 571 - 578. The resonant
frequency response of each further secondary element 471 - 478, 571 - 578 is imposed upon the
AC current induced in the further secondary element. The AC current induced in each further
secondary element 471 - 478, 571 - 578 produces an AC electromagnetic field which is
electromagnetically coupled to the tertiary element 625 on the shifting tool 114. The controller
124 detects the AC current signal received by the tertiary element 625 and monitors the received
signal as a function of swept frequency as previously described above with reference to Figures
4(a) and 4(b). The generally orthogonal orientation of the axially elongated primary coils 622a,
622b, 622c etc of the primary element 622 and the generally circumferential coil of the tertiary
element 625 reduces any cross-coupling of the signal from the primary element 622 directly to
the tertiary element 625 without first inducing an AC current in one or more of the further

                                                  105
secondary elements 471 - 478, 571 - 578. This may improve a signal to noise ratio of the
detected signal received at the tertiary element 625, thereby improving measurement sensitivity.
[0984] Figure 10 shows a plurality of primary elements 722 for use in the system 10 of Figures
1(a) and 1(b) or the system 110 of Figures 5(a) - 5(c). The plurality of primary elements 722
comprises a first primary element 722a (illustrated using solid lines in Figures 10 and 11), a
second primary element 722b (illustrated using dashed lines in Figures 10 and 11) and a third
primary element 722c (illustrated using dotted lines in Figures 10 and 11). Each primary
element 722a, 722b and 722c is arranged around a base member 740 which defines an axis 736.
In use, the axis 736 is aligned co-axially with the axis 36 of system 10 or the axis 136 of system
110.
[0985] Each primary element 722a, 722b and 722c comprises a pair of coils which are
connected electrically in parallel. Both coils of each primary element 722a, 722b and 722c are
located diametrically opposite one another. It should be understood that both coils of the third
primary element 722c are visible in Figure 10 (illustrated using dotted lines) but that only one of
the coils of the primary element 722a and only one of the coils of the primary element 722b are
visible in Figure 10.
[0986] The plurality of primary elements 722 is shown in use in Figure 11 which represents a
cross-section taken perpendicular to the axis 136 of the system 110 when used with the third
alternative plurality 470 of further secondary elements 471 - 478 shown in Figure 7(b). As
shown in Figures 10 and 11, the coils of each primary element 722a, 722b and 722c have a
circumferential extent of 90' around the body 120 of the shifting tool 114. A coil of each
primary element 722a, 722b and 722c overlaps circumferentially with a coil of an adjacent
primary element 722a, 722b and 722c by approximately 20'. As will be described in more
detail below such an arrangement of primary coils may be used to provide an electromagnetic
field which is circumferentially more uniform for coupling to any of the secondary elements 471
- 478 as the shifting tool 114 is run through the throughbore 116 defined by the downhole tool
118.
[0987] In use, an electrical signal is applied to the coils of each primary element 722a, 722b and
722c one at a time to ensure that the electromagnetic field swept circumferentially around the
shifting tool 114 and the frequency of the electrical signal is stepped over a desired frequency

                                                   106
range which is known to include the resonant frequencies fl - f8 of the secondary elements 471
- 478 to be detected as the shifting tool 114 is run through the throughbore 116. The frequency
step size is selected so as to be smaller than a bandwidth of each of the resonant peaks in the
frequency response of the secondary elements 471 - 478 at the respective resonant frequencies
fl - f8.
[0988] During a first transmit period, the controller 124 applies an electrical signal at a first
frequency to the coils of the first primary element 722a. During a first receive period
subsequent to the first transmit period, the controller 124 detects any residual response such as
any residual ringing of one of the secondary elements 471 - 478 present on the coils of the first
primary element 722a at the first frequency. The transmit and receive steps are repeated for the
first primary element 722a for each frequency in the desired frequency range. The transmit and
receive steps are then repeated for each frequency in the desired frequency range for each of the
other primary elements 722b and 722c to ensure a sweep of the electromagnetic field both
circumferentially around the shifting tool 114 and through the desired frequency range.
[0989] In an alternative method, the controller 124 applies an electrical signal at a first
frequency to the coils of the first primary element 722a during a first transmit period and detects
an electrical signal present on the coils of the first primary element 722a during a first receive
period subsequent to the first transmit period. The controller 124 then applies an electrical
signal at the first frequency to the coils of the second primary element 722b during a second
transmit period and detects an electrical signal present on the coils of the second primary
element 722b during a second receive period subsequent to the first transmit period. The
transmit and receive steps are repeated for the coils of the third primary element 722c before the
frequency is stepped up to the next frequency in the desired frequency range. The process is
repeated for each of the primary elements 722a, 722b and 722c at each frequency in the desired
frequency range.
[0990] One skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications are possible to the
downhole detection systems 10 and 110. For example, rather than comprising a secondary coil
134, the secondary element 133 may comprise a series of rings such as one of the series of rings
170, 270. Although such a secondary element would be covered by the cover sleeve 132 and
would not be accessible when the downhole tool 118 is in a de-actuated state, such a secondary

                                                  107
element may be used to not only indicate the status of the downhole tool 118, but to also
identify the downhole tool 118 after actuation of the downhole tool 118.
[0991] One or both of the shifting tools 14, 114 may comprise a further primary element in the
form of a further primary coil (not shown) wound around the shifting tool 14, 114. The addition
of such a further primary coil may provide redundancy for more accurate and/or more reliable
detection of the status and/or identity of a downhole tool 18, 118. Such a further primary coil
may also serve as a spare primary coil which may be used in the event of failure of the primary
coil 22, 122.
[0992] Rather than using eight further secondary elements, more or fewer further secondary
elements may be used. This may permit numbers such as identification codes to be associated
with a downhole tool which are greater than or less than 255.
[0993] Each further secondary element may define a different resonant frequency to every other
further secondary element. At least two of the further secondary elements may define the same
resonant frequency.
[0994] A converse orthogonal arrangement of primary and tertiary elements may be used to that
shown in Figure 9. In such a converse arrangement, the primary and tertiary elements are still
mounted on a base member and are still electrically insulated from one another, but it is the
primary element that is circumferentially or helically wound around the base member and the
tertiary element which comprises a plurality of tertiary coils connected electrically in series.
Each tertiary coil extends around a corresponding axis, each axis arranged along a different
radial direction relative to a longitudinal axis of the downhole tool. Each tertiary coil is
elongated in a direction along the longitudinal axis.
[0995] The following description of Figures 12 - 19(b), refers to one or more stimulator
elements, one or more indicator elements, one or more sensor elements, and one or more further
indicator elements. It should understood that each stimulator element may comprise a primary
element described with reference to any of Figures 1 - 11, each indicator element may comprise
a secondary element as described with reference to any of Figures 1 - 11, each sensor element
may comprise a tertiary element as described with reference to any of Figures 1 - 11, and each
further indicator element may comprise any further secondary element as described with
reference to any of Figures 1 - 11.

                                                  108
[0996] Referring now to Figure 12, there is shown a downhole system generally designated
1002 comprising a downhole arrangement in the form of a downhole completion tool generally
designated 1004 and a deployable tool in the form of a shifting tool 1006. The completion tool
1004 extends along a longitudinal axis 1005 and defines a through bore 1007 internally thereof.
The shifting tool 1006 is deployed within the through bore 1007. The downhole completion tool
1004 is installed adjacent to a hydrocarbon bearing formation 1008. It should be understood
that the downhole direction is to the right in Figure 12. The same is true of Figures 13, 14, 16,
18 and 19(a).
[0997] The downhole completion tool 1004 may be configured to perform various downhole
operations. For example, the downhole completion tool 1004 may be used for the purposes of
fracturing the formation 1008 and/or controlling the production of hydrocarbon fluids from the
formation 1008 into the through bore 1007. Such operations are typically performed by opening
or closing flow ports (not shown) of the downhole completion tool 1004 to permit fluid to flow
between the formation 1008 and the through bore 1007. The downhole completion tool 1004
comprises a first part in the form of a main body 1012 and a second part in the form of a sleeve
1014 which is configured for sliding relative to the main body 1012. The main body 1012
defines a first set of apertures (not shown). The sleeve 1014 defines a second set of
corresponding apertures (not shown). The sliding sleeve 1014 is moveable relative to the main
body 1012 until the first and second sets of apertures (not shown) are fully aligned so as to
define the flow ports (not shown). To close the flow ports (not shown), the sliding sleeve 1014
is moved until the first and second sets of apertures (not shown) are mis-aligned.
[0998] In some applications, it may be desirable to provide a flow restriction on the flow of
fluids between the formation 1008 and the through bore 1007. This may require that the first
and second sets of apertures (not shown) are only partially aligned. The shifting tool 1006 is
deployed within the through bore 1007 on a support member (not shown), such as wireline,
slickline, E-line, coiled tubing or the like and, as will be described in more detail below, is used
to determine the position of the sliding sleeve 1014 relative to the main body 1012 of the
completion tool 1004. This may provide an indication of the degree to which the first and
second sets of apertures (not shown) are aligned and, therefore, an indication of the size of flow
restriction provided by the flow ports (not shown).

                                                  109
[0999] The completion tool 1004 comprises a circumferential recess 1015 which accommodates
a plurality of axially distributed indicator elements 1016. Each indicator element 1016
comprises an electrical conductor which defines an electrically conductive path having a
plurality of turns or loops. More specifically, each indicator element 1016 comprises a helical
coil of wire extending helically around a corresponding axis which is aligned radially relative to
the longitudinal axis 1005 of the completion tool 1004. Each indicator element 1016 further
comprises a capacitor (not shown) connected between the ends of the corresponding coil of
wire. The geometry of the wire coil and the size of the capacitor are selected so as to provide
the indicator element 1016 with a characteristic resonant frequency response having a
characteristic resonant feature at a predetermined resonant frequency. Each indicator element
1016 is configured to have a different resonant frequency fl - f8 in the frequency range of 100
150 kHz.
[01000]         The shifting tool 1006 comprises a main body 1020 and a stimulator element in
the form of a primary coil 1022 wound circumferentially around an outer diameter of the main
body 1020. The shifting tool 1006 further comprises a controller 1024 and a power source 1026
for providing power to the controller 1024. The controller 1024 is electrically connected to the
ends of the primary coil 1022. The controller 1024 is configured to generate and apply an
alternating current electrical signal to the primary coil 1022 and to measure an electrical signal
existing on the primary coil 1022.
[01001]         In use, the shifting tool 1006 is deployed downhole of the completion tool 1004
and pulled upwardly past the completion tool 1004. The shifting tool 1006 actuates the sliding
sleeve 1014 to a position corresponding to a desired flow restriction and the primary coil 1022
and is pulled upwardly past the indicator elements 1016 to determine the relative position of
sliding sleeve 1014 relative to the main body 1012 of the completion tool 1004 as will be
described in more detail below.
[01002]         The controller 1024 generates and applies a swept frequency alternating current
electrical signal to the primary coil 1022 and monitors the electrical signal existing on the
primary coil 1022 as the primary coil 1022 and is pulled upwardly past the indicator elements
1016. The frequency of the alternating current electrical signal applied to the primary coil 1022
is repeatedly swept between 100 - 150 kHz. As the primary coil 1022 is pulled upwardly past
the indicator elements 1016, the controller monitors the frequency spectrum of the electrical

                                                  110
signal existing on the primary coil 1022. With reference to the position of the sliding sleeve
1014 relative to the main body 1012 of the completion tool 1004 shown in Figure 1, as the
primary coil 1022 is pulled upwardly past all of the indicator elements 1016, the controller 1024
detects a resonant feature at resonant frequencies f8, f7, f6 and f5. No resonant features are
detected at resonant frequencies f4, f3, f2 or fl because the sliding sleeve 1014 prevents
coupling of the magnetic field from the primary coil 1022 to the indicator element 1016 having
these resonant frequencies. The controller 1024 is pre-programmed with the predetermined
axial distribution of the indicator elements 1016 and subsequently uses this information together
with the detected resonant frequencies f8, f7, f6 and f5 to determine the position of the sliding
sleeve 1014 relative to the main body 1012 of the completion tool 1004.
[01003]         Figure 13 shows an alternative arrangement of indicator elements 1116 for use
with the system 1002 of Figure 12. The indicator elements 1116 are identical to the indicator
elements 1016 of Figure 12 in all respects except that the indicator elements 1116 are arranged
helically around the through bore 1007 of the completion tool 1004. As shown in Figure 13,
this allows the indicator elements 1116 to be arranged with an axial overlap so as to enhance the
resolution of the measurement of the axial position of the sliding sleeve 1014 relative to the
main body 1012 of the completion tool 1004 in the axial direction relative to the longitudinal
axis 1005.
[01004]         Figure 14 illustrates the primary and tertiary element arrangement 630 of Figure
9 in use for stimulating and sensing a single indicator element or secondary element 1016 of the
completion tool 1004 of Figure 12. The primary and tertiary element arrangement 630 is
arranged symmetrically about a lateral plane 1040 which is perpendicular to the longitudinal
axis 1005 of the completion tool 1004. Similarly, the secondary element 1016 has a resonant
frequency f8 and is arranged symmetrically about a lateral plane 1042 which is also
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 1005 of the completion tool 1004. The separation of the
lateral planes 1040 and 1042 defines an axial offset between the secondary element 1016 and the
primary and tertiary element arrangement 630. It has been discovered that when one of the coils
622a, 622b, 622c of the primary element 622 is aligned axially (zero axial offset) and
circumferentially with the secondary element 1016, the resonant feature in the frequency
spectrum of the signal measured on the tertiary element 625 by the controller 1024 is
suppressed. Moreover, the suppression of the resonant feature is relatively sensitive to the
misalignment of the coils 622a, 622b, 622c of the primary element 622 and the secondary

                                                  111
element 1016. For coils having a major dimension of the order of several tens of millimetres,
the suppression of the resonant feature disappears for misalignments on the order of a few
millimetres. The suppression of the resonant feature in the frequency spectrum has been
attributed to the inversion of the phase of the electrical signal measured on the tertiary element
625 as the tertiary element 625 passes the secondary element 1016. Such suppression of the
resonant feature may provide a relatively high resolution method of determining the position of
the sliding sleeve 1014 relative to the main body 1012 of the completion tool 1004.
[01005]         Figure 15 shows a further downhole system generally designated 1202
comprising a downhole arrangement in the form of a downhole completion tool generally
designated 1204 and a deployable tool in the form of a shifting tool 1206. The completion tool
1204 extends along a longitudinal axis 1205 and defines a through bore 1207 internally thereof.
The shifting tool 1206 is deployed within the through bore 1207. The downhole completion tool
1204 is installed adjacent to a hydrocarbon bearing formation 1208.
[01006]         The downhole system 1202 of Figure 15 shares many like features with the
downhole system 1002 of Figure 12 and, as such, like features share like reference numerals.
Like the completion tool 1004 of the system of Figure 12, the completion tool 1204 of the
system 1202 of Figure 15 comprises a main body 1212 and a sleeve 1214. Unlike the
completion tool 1004 of the system of Figure 12, however, the sleeve 1214 of the completion
tool 1204 shown in Figure 15 rotates relative to the main body 1212 so as to circumferentially
align or misalign apertures (not shown) and thereby control flow restriction. The sleeve 1214
defines a transparent window 1250 which extends circumferentially around a portion of the
circumference of the sleeve 1214. The shifting tool 1206 comprises a stimulator element in the
form of a primary coil 1222 which extends circumferentially around the main body 1220 of the
shifting tool 1206.
[01007]         In use, when the window 1250 is circumferentially aligned between the primary
coil 1222 and an indicator element 1216, the controller 1224 (not shown) detects the
characteristic resonant feature and determines the relative alignment of the sleeve 1214 relative
to the main body 1212 from the frequency of the detected resonant feature and from knowledge
of the circumferential distribution of the indicator elements 1216.

                                                  112
[01008]         Figure 16 shows a downhole system generally designated 1302 comprising a
downhole arrangement in the form of a downhole completion tool generally designated 1304
and a deployable tool in the form of a shifting tool 1306. The completion tool 1304 extends
along a longitudinal axis 1305 and defines a through bore 1307 internally thereof. The shifting
tool 1306 is deployed within the through bore 1307. The downhole completion tool 1304 is
installed adjacent to a hydrocarbon bearing formation 1308.
[01009]         The downhole system 1302 of Figure 16 shares many like features with the
downhole system 1002 of Figure 12 and, as such, like features share like reference numerals.
Like the completion tool 1004 of the system of Figure 12, the completion tool 1304 of the
system 1302 of Figure 16 comprises a main body 1312 and a sleeve 1314. Unlike the
completion tool 1004 of the system of Figure 12, however, the downhole system 1302 of Figure
16 comprises a plurality of indicator elements in the form of a plurality of permanent magnets
1316, wherein each magnet 1316 is configured so as to provide a different or a distinctive
magnetic field HI - H8 to every other magnet 1316. The magnets 1316 may be configured
differently for this purpose. For example, the magnets 1316 may be structurally identical but
oriented differently. Some of the magnets 1316 may have a north pole directed towards the
through bore 1307 and some of the magnets 1316 may have a south pole directed towards the
through bore 1307. Each magnet 1316 may have a different magnetic attenuator (not shown)
inserted between the magnet 1316 and the through bore 1307. Each magnet 1316 may have a
different sized aperture (not shown) inserted between the magnet 1316 and the through bore
1307. Unlike the shifting tool 1006 of Figure 12, the shifting tool 1306 does not comprise a
stimulator element of any kind. Unlike the shifting tool 1006 of Figure 12, the shifting tool
1306 of Figure 16 comprises a sensor arrangement in the form of a circumferentially distributed
plurality of magnetic field sensor elements in the form of a circumferentially distributed
plurality of Hall effect sensors 1354.
[01010]         In use, as the shifting tool 1306 is pulled upwardly, the Hall effect sensors 1354
move past the magnets 1316. From knowledge of the axial distribution of the magnets 1316 and
from the magnetic filed measurements provided by the Hall effect sensors 1354, the controller
1324 may determine the position of the sliding sleeve 1314 relative to the main body 1312 of
the completion tool 1304.

                                                   113
[01011]          Figure 17 shows a downhole system generally designated 1402 comprising a
downhole arrangement in the form of a downhole completion tool generally designated 1404
and a deployable tool in the form of a shifting tool 1406. The completion tool 1404 extends
along a longitudinal axis 1405 and defines a through bore 1407 internally thereof. The shifting
tool 1406 is deployed within the through bore 1407. The downhole completion tool 1404 is
installed adjacent to a hydrocarbon bearing formation 1408. The completion tool 1404
comprises a main body 1412 and a sleeve 1314 which is rotatable relative to the main body
1412. Like the system 1302 of Figure 16, the system 1402 of Figure 17 relies upon a plurality
of magnets 1416, wherein each magnet 1416 provides a different magnetic field to every other
magnet 1416. The shifting tool 1406 comprises a plurality of circumferentially distributed Hall
effect sensors 1454.
[01012]          In use, as the shifting tool 1406 is pulled upwardly, the Hall effect sensors 1454
move past the magnets 1416. From knowledge of the circumferential distribution of the
magnets 1416 and from the magnetic field measurements provided by the Hall effect sensors
1454, the controller (not shown) may determine the position of the rotatable sleeve 1414 relative
to the main body 1412 of the completion tool 1404.
[01013]          Figure 18 shows a downhole system generally designated 1502 comprising a
downhole arrangement in the form of a downhole completion tool generally designated 1504
and a deployable tool in the form of a shifting tool 1506. The completion tool 1504 extends
along a longitudinal axis 1505 and defines a through bore 1507 internally thereof. The shifting
tool 1506 is deployed within the through bore 1507. The downhole completion tool 1504 is
installed adjacent to a hydrocarbon bearing formation 1508. The completion tool 1504
comprises a first part 1512 and a second part 1514 which is rotatable relative to the first part
1512 so as to adjust a degree of flow restriction provided by the completion tool 1504. As
shown in Figure 18, the completion tool 1504 only comprises two indicator elements 1516. A
first indicator element in the form of a coil and capacitor (not shown) having a first resonant
frequency fl is mounted on the first part 1512 of the completion tool 1504. A second indicator
element in the form of a coil and capacitor (not shown) having a second resonant frequency f2 is
mounted on the second part 1514 of the completion tool 1504.
[01014]          The shifting tool 1506 comprises a plurality 1532 of stimulator elements in the
form of a plurality of circumferentially distributed coils 1534 which are electrically insulated

                                                   114
from one another. The stimulator elements 1534 are independently electrically connected to the
controller (not shown). The shifting tool 1506 further comprises a sensor element in the form of
a coil 1533 which extends circumferentially around the shifting tool 1506. The coil 1533 is also
independently electrically connected to the controller (not shown).
[01015]          In use, as the shifting tool 1506 is pulled upwardly, the stimulator elements 1534
move past the indicator elements 1516. The controller (not shown) sequentially stimulates each
of the different stimulator elements 1534 with a swept frequency electrical signal until magnetic
coupling with the second indicator element having the second resonant frequency f2 occurs.
The controller then records the stimulator element used for the detection of the resonant
frequency f2. The shifting tool 1506 continues upwardly until magnetic coupling with the first
indicator element having the first resonant frequency fl occurs. The controller then records the
stimulator element used for the detection of the resonant frequency fl. From knowledge of the
circumferential distribution of the stimulator elements 1534 and from the recorded stimulator
elements used for the detection of the resonant frequencies fl and f2, the controller determines
the relative rotational positions of the first and second parts 1512 and 1514 of the completion
tool 1504.
[01016]          In a variant (not shown) of the system 1502 of Figure 18 for measuring the
relative linear position between first and second parts of a completion tool, the completion tool
may comprise a mechanical arrangement which converts relative linear motion between the first
and second parts into rotational motion of part 1514 relative to part 1512. For example, the
completion tool may comprise a helical groove and pin arrangement (not shown) for this
purpose.
[01017]          Figures 19(a) and 19(b) show a downhole system generally designated 1602
comprising a downhole arrangement in the form of a downhole completion tool generally
designated 1604 and a deployable tool in the form of a shifting tool 1606. The completion tool
1604 extends along a longitudinal axis 1605 and defines a through bore 1607 internally thereof.
The shifting tool 1606 is deployed within the through bore 1607. The downhole completion tool
1604 is installed adjacent to a hydrocarbon bearing formation 1608. The completion tool 1604
comprises a first part 1612 and a second part 1614 which is rotatable relative to the first part
1612 so as to adjust a degree of flow restriction provided by the completion tool 1604. As
shown in Figure 19, the completion tool 1604 only comprises two indicator elements 1616. A

                                                   115
first indicator element 1616 is mounted on the first part 1612 of the completion tool 1604 and
takes the form of a first permanent magnet having its north pole directed towards the through
bore 1607. A second indicator element 1616 is mounted on the second part 1614 of the
completion tool 1606 and takes the form of a second permanent magnet having its south pole
directed towards the through bore 1607.
[01018]          The shifting tool 1606 comprises a circumferentially distributed array of Hall
effect sensors 1654. Each of the Hall effect sensor 1654 are independently electrically
connected to the controller (not shown).
[01019]          In use, as the shifting tool 1606 is pulled upwardly, the controller (not shown)
sequentially monitors the magnetic field strength around the circumference of the shifting tool
1606 using the Hall effect sensors 1654 until a magnetic field is detected from the N pole. The
controller then records the Hall effect sensor 1654 which detected the N pole. The shifting tool
1606 continues upwardly until a magnetic field is detected from the S pole. The controller then
records the Hall effect sensor 1654 which detected the S pole. From knowledge of the
circumferential distribution of the Hall effect sensors 1654 and from the Hall effect sensors
which detected the N and S poles, the controller determines the relative rotational positions of
the first and second parts 1612 and 1614 of the completion tool 604. The system 1602 is
particularly advantageous because it only requires permanent magnets to be located downhole
with the completion tool 1604.
[01020]          In a variant (not shown) of the system 1602 of Figure 19 for measuring the
relative linear position between first and second parts of a completion tool, the completion tool
may comprise a mechanical arrangement which converts relative linear motion between the first
and second parts into rotational motion of part 1614 relative to part 1612. For example, the
completion tool may comprise a helical groove and pin arrangement (not shown) for this
purpose.
[01021]          One skilled in the art will understand that various modifications of the systems of
Figures 12 to 19(b) are possible without departing from the scope of the present invention. For
example, the indicator elements 1016 shown in Figure 12 may extend circumferentially around
the through bore 1007. The number of stimulator elements, the number of indicator elements
and/or the number of sensor elements may be greater or fewer than illustrated in Figures 12 to

                                                  116
19(b). Rather than only using one indicator element 1516 on each part 1512, 1514 of the
completion tool 1504 of Figure 18, more than one indicator element 1516 may be used on each
part 1512, 1514, wherein each indicator element 1516 has a different resonant frequency.
[01022]         One skilled in the art will understand that various modifications of any of the
systems of Figures 1 to 19(b) are possible without departing from the scope of the present
invention. For example, with reference to the system 10 of Figures 1(a) and 1(b) and the system
110 of Figures 5(a) - 5(c), rather than the primary element 22, 122, the controller 24, 124 and
the power supply 26, 126 being located on the shifting tool 14, 114 and the secondary element
34, 134, and/or the further secondary element 170 being located on the downhole tool 18, 118,
the primary element 22, 122, the controller 24, 124 and the power supply 26, 126 may be
located on the downhole tool 18, 118 and the secondary element 34, 134, and/or the further
secondary element 170 may be located on the shifting tool 14, 114.
[01023]         In a further alternative variant shown in Figures 20(a) and 20(b), primary
elements 1722a, 1722b and 1722c etc, a controller 1724 and a power supply 1726 may be
located on a downhole tool 1718 and a plurality of secondary elements 1734 may be mounted on
a carrier 1714 which is run, dropped, pumped or otherwise conveyed along a throughbore 1716
defined by the downhole tool 1718. It should be appreciated that, in the interests of clarity, only
primary element 1722b is shown in Figure 20(a). Like the primary elements 722a, 722b and
722c etc described with reference to Figures 10 and 11, the primary elements 1722a, 1722b and
1722c etc each comprise a pair of diametrically opposed, parallel connected coils. The
operation of the primary elements 1722a, 1722b and 1722c is identical to the operation of the
primary elements 722a, 722b and 722c etc described with reference to Figures 10 and 11. The
carrier 1714 may comprise a head portion 1714a and an elongated body portion 1714b. As a
consequence of this configuration of the carrier 1714, the secondary elements 1734 may adopt a
preferred orientation relative to the throughbore 1716 of the downhole tool 1718 when conveyed
by a fluid flowing along the throughbore 1716. This may serve to improve the coupling of an
electromagnetic field between the primary elements 1722a, 1722b and 1722c etc located on the
downhole tool 1718 and the secondary elements 1734. The secondary elements 1734 may also
be encapsulated for mechanical and/or environmental protection. In such a further alternative
variant, the secondary elements 1734 may provide the function of a tag which may be provided
from surface. However, unlike an RFID tag which incorporates active electronics, the carrier
1714 and the secondary elements 1734 would be electronically passive and would therefore be

                                              117
more robust and more reliable in a high temperature environment. It should be understood that
other primary element arrangements may also be used in connection with the carrier 1714 and
the secondary elements 1734. For example, there may be more or fewer primary elements than
shown in Figures 20(a) and 20(b). There may be only one primary element. The one or more
primary elements may be oriented differently. For example, the one or more primary elements
may extend circumferentially or helically around the throughbore 1716.
