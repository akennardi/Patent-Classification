                                  BACKGROUND
[0003]         There exist today many types of hand-held electronic devices,
each of which utilizes some sort of user interface. The user interface typically
includes an output device in the form of a display, such as a Liquid Crystal
Display (LCD), and one or more input devices, which can be mechanically
actuated    (e.g., switches, buttons, keys, dials, joysticks, joy pads)           or
                                          1

 WO 2006/094308                                                   PCT/US2006/008349
electrically activated (eg., touch pads or touch screens).        The display is
typically configured to present visual information such as text and graphics,
and the input devices are typically configured perform operations such as
issuing commands, making selections or moving a cursor or selector in the
electronic device. Each of these well known devices has considerations such
as size and shape limitations, costs, functionality, complexity, etc. that must
 be taken into account when designing the hand-held electronic device. In
 most cases, the user interface is positioned on the front face (or front
surface) of the hand-held device for easy viewing of the display and easy
 manipulation of the input devices.
 [0004]          Figs. 1A-IF are diagrams of various hand-held electronic
 devices including for example a telephone 10A (Fig. 1A), a PDA 10B (Fig. 11),
 a media player 10C (Fig. 1C), a remote control 1OD (Fig. 1D), a camera IE
 (Fig. 1E), and a GPS module 1OF (Fig. 1F). In each of these devices 10, a
 display 12, which is secured inside the housing of the device 10 and which
 can be seen through an opening in the housing, is typically positioned in a
 first region of the electronic device 10. Each of these devices also include one
 or more input devices 14, which are typically positioned in a second region of
 the electronic device 10 next to the display 12.
 [0005]          To elaborate, the telephone 10A typically includes a display 12
 such as a character or graphical display, and input devices 14 such as a
 number pad and in some cases a navigation pad. The PDA 10B typically
 includes a display 12 such as a graphical display, and input devices 14 such as
 a stylus based resistive touch screen and buttons. The media player 1OC
 typically includes a display 12 such as a character or graphic display and input
 devices 14 such as buttons or wheels. The iPod@ media player manufactured
  by Apple Computer, Inc. of Cupertino, California is one example of a media
  player that includes both a display and input devices disposed next to the
  display. The remote control 10D typically includes an input device 14 such as
  a keypad and may or may not have a character display 12. The camera 10E
  typically includes a display 12 such as a graphic display and input devices 14
  such as buttons. The GPS module 1OF typically includes a display 12 such as
                                          2

WO 2006/094308                                                   PCT/US2006/008349
graphic display and input devices 14 such as buttons, and in some cases a joy
 pad.
 [0006]         Recently, traditionally separate hand-held electronic devices
 have begun to be combined in limited ways. For example, the telephone 10A
 has been combined with the PDA 10B.             One problem that has been
encountered is in the way inputs are made into the device. Each of these
devices has a particular set of input mechanisms for providing inputs into the
device. Some of these input mechanisms are generic to all the devices (e.g.,
 power button) while others are not.       The ones that are not generic are
typically dedicated to a particular functionality of the device.     By way of
example, PDAs typically include four dedicated buttons while cell phones
typically include a numeric keypad and at least two dedicated buttons.
 [0007]         Thus it is a challenge to design a .merged device with limited
input devices without adversely affecting the dedicated inputs for each
device. As will be appreciated, it is preferable, not to overload the hand-held
devices with a large number of input mechanisms as this tends to confuse the
user and take up valuable space, ie., "real estate." In the case of hand-held
devices, space is at a premium because of their small size. At some point
there is not enough space on the device to house all the necessary buttons
and switches, etc. This is especially true when considering that all these
devices need a display that typically takes up a large amount of space on its
own. To increase the number of input devices beyond some level, designers
would have to decrease the size of the display. However, this will often leave
a negative impression on the user because the user typically desires the
largest display possible. Alternatively, to accommodate more input devices
designers may opt to increase the size of the device. This, too, will often
leave a negative impression on a user because it would make one-handed
operations difficult, and at some point, the size of the device becomes so
large that it is no longer considered a hand-held device.
[0008]         Therefore what is needed in the art is an improved user
interface that works for multi-functional hand-held devices.

                                    SUMMARY
[0009]         Disclosed herein is a multi-functional hand-held device capable
of configuring user inputs based on how the device is to be used. Preferable,
the multi-functional hand-held device has at most only a few physical buttons,
keys, or switches so that its display size can be substantially increased. In
other words, by eliminating physical buttons, keys,.or switches from a front
surface of an electronic device, additional surface area becomes available for
 a larger display.    Ultimately this strategy would allow a substantially full
 screen display.     As used herein, a full screen display is a display that
 consumes, or at least dominates, a surface (e.g., front surface) of an
 electronic device.
 [0010]        Various embodiments of a multi-functional hand-held device are
 discussed below with reference to Figs. 2-28. However, those skilled in the
 art will appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to
 these figures is exemplary and not exhaustive and that many variations on
 these embodiments are possible.

                            DETAILED DESCRIPTION
I.     MULTI-FUNCTIONALITY
[0040]         Electronic device manufacturers have discovered the advantages
of combining separate hand-held electronic devices to form multi-function
devices. By having a single multi-function device, a user is not burdened with
carrying, purchasing, and maintaining multiple devices. Further, the user is
not limited in the operations that can be performed, i e., the user can perform
different operations with a single device that would have otherwise required
the use of a different devices.
[0041]         As used herein, the term "multi-functional" is used to define a
device that has the capabilities of two or more traditional devices in a single
device. The multi-functional device may, for example, include two or more of
the following device functionalities: PDA, cell phone, music player, video
player, game player, digital camera, handtop, Internet terminal, GPS or
remote control. For each new device functionality that is added to a single
device, the complexity and size of the device tends to increase. Therefore,
with hand-held devices, there is typically a trade-off between beeping the
footprint small and complexity low while still maximizing the functionality of
the device.
[0042]         In some cases, combing devices may result in redundant
hardware components, which allows components to be used for multiple
different, device functionalities. In other cases, certain hardware components
are distinct to each device and therefore additional space and connectivity
must be made available. Furthermore, each device functionality typically has
its own programming or application software and, therefore, the multifunction
device must be designed with enough memory to accommodate all the
various software components.

 [0043]       -A personal digital assistant (PDA) is a mobile hand-held device
that provides computing and information storage and retrieval capabilities for
personal and/or business use. PDAs are severally capable of tracking names,
addresses, phone numbers and appointments. They are also often capable of
taking notes, performing calculations, paging, data messaging, and electronic
mail.   PDAs may also include functionality for playing simple games, music,
and other media files. Examples of PDAs include the Palm Pilot and
Blackberry.
[0044]          Like most hand-held devices, PDAs typically include a display
and various input devices. The input devices may include a stylus and touch
screen that work in combination with a handwriting recognition program,
keypads, mini-keyboards, navigation pads, and/or soft or fixed function
buttons.
[0045]         Cell phones are mobile telephones that allow a user to connect
to other telephones using a cellular network. Cell phones typically include a
transceiver for transmitting and receiving telephone calls, controls such as a
navigation pad for traversing through a display, a keypad for making numeric
entries (and in some cases alphabetic entries), and soft or fixed function
buttons. For example, in many cell phones one fixed function button is used
for starting a call and another fixed function button is used for ending a call.
[0046]         Media players come in a variety of forms.       Music players are
generally configured to store, process and output music. Music players can
be based on the MP3 or AAC format, which is a compression system for
music.    Music Players typically include a microprocessor, memory, display,
audio jack, data port and playback controls. The playback controls typically
include features such as menu, play/pause, next, previous, volume up, and
volume down. Video players are similar to music players in most respects. In
some cases, they may include a data storage device for receiving a removable
storage medium such as a DVD. The iPod@ media player manufactured by
Apple Computer, Inc.      of Cupertino, California is one example of a media
player.

[0047]         Handtops are general purpose computers similar to laptops, but
in a smaller form factor.      Handtops typically include a display and a full
keyboard.
[0048]         Fig. 2 is a simplified diagram of a multi-functional hand-held
device 100. The multi-functional hand-held device 100 integrates at least two
devices 102 into a single device. Each device 102 includes both hardware
and software components 104 and 106, which are integrated into multi
functional hand-held device 100.      It should be pointed out that the multi
functional hand-held device 100 is not limited to only two devices, and may in
fact integrate any number of devices.
[0049]         Multi-functional device 100 also includes switch 110, which that
allows multi-functional device 100 to be switched from one device operating
mode to another device operating mode. For example, switch 110 may allow
a user to cycle through cell phone, media player, and PDA modes of
operation. Once a particular operating mode is selected, the multi-functional
device 100 operates as the selected device. For example, the programming
related to the selected device is activated for use by the multi-functional
hand-held device. The programming may include reconfiguring the UI based
on the selected device so that the inputs made by the user correlate to the
device in use. For example, the functions of any physical buttons, switches or
dials as well as soft buttons, switches or dials can be reconfigured to
correspond to the selected device.
[0050]         However, the operating modes of multi-functional hand-held
device 100 need not completely independent.           In many cases, it will be
desirable to allow the multiple functionalities to interact with each other. For
Example, a user may look up a telephone number of a contact in the PDA and
pass this number to the phone to be dialed.

II.     FORM FACTOR
[0051]         The form factor of a hand-held device is generally a device that
can easily be held in one hand. A typical hand-held device includes a small
display in an upper portion of the front surface of the device and input
controls in a lower portion of the front surface of the device. The device may
additionally include controls and ports on the top, bottom, and side surfaces.
 Prior art hand-held devices have typically had small displays which causes
some dissatisfaction for users of these devices. It is generally preferred to
 have larger displays so that more information can be displayed or the
 information being displayed can be more easily viewable (e.g., larger text).
 In the case of video players and game players in particular, larger displays are
 much preferred over smaller ones.
 [0052]        However, the use of large displays has been limited in the past
 because the required input controls often take up substantial portions of the
 available space. Furthermore, as device functionality converges, the number
 of controls on the device typically increases as each device includes its own
 dedicated controls. Therefore devices must be made larger or the displays
 must be smaller to accommodate all the new controls. Both of these
 outcomes are unsatisfactory. Larger devices are bulky and hard to use, and
 smaller screens are difficult to utilize for both relaying information and
 reading information from the screen.
 A.     ONE-HANDED VS. TWO-HANDED OPERATION
 [0053]        A hand-held electronic device may be directed at one-handed
 operation or two-handed operation. In one-handed operation, a single hand
 is used to both support the device as well as to perform operations with the
 user interface during use. Cellular phones and media players are examples of
 hand-held devices are generally intended to can be operated solely with one
 hand. In the case of a cell phone, for example, a user may grasp the phone
 in one hand between the fingers and the palm and use the thumb to make
 entries using keys, buttons or a # joy pad.
                                         9

WO 2006/094308                                                    PCT/US2006/008349
[0054]          In two-handed operation, one hand is used to support the
device while the other hand performs operations with a user interface during
use or, alternatively, both hands support the device as well as perform
operations during use. PDA's and game players are examples of hand-held
device that are typically operated with two hands. In the case of a PDA, for
example, the user may grasp the device with one hand and make entries
using the other hand, for example, using a stylus. In the case of a game
player, the user typically grasps the device in both hands and make entries
using either or both hands while holding the device.
B.       FOOTPRINT/SIZE
[0055]           Hand-held devices may have a variety different footprints or
sizes. The footprint is typically associated with how the device is going to be
used. Devices such as PDAs are typically used with both hands and thus they
tend to be larger. Alternatively, cell phone handsets are typically used with
only one hand, and thus they tend to be smaller. When integrating multiple
devices, it is important task to determine the appropriate footprint of the
device. For example, some believe that PDAs are too large for phone use
while cell phones are too small for PDA use. Designers generally must
consider the primary use of the device and gear the footprint towards that
 use. Although there are different footprints, there are typically minimum and
 maximum footprints. If the footprint is too large or too small, the device may
 be difficult to use.
 [0056]          Because of their size, the smaller devices are typically placed in
 a pocket while the larger devices are not. A media player is one example of a
 hand-held device that is sized for placement into a pocket of the user. By
 being pocket-sized, the user does not have to directly carry the device and
 therefore the device can be taken almost anywhere the user travels (e.g., the
 user is not limited by carrying a large, bulky and often heavy device, as in a
 laptop or notebook computer).

WO 2006/094308                                                     PCT/US2006/008349
 [0057]         Generally it is preferred, although not necessary, that hand-held
 devices of the type disclosed herein have dimensions of about 5 in x 3 in x 1
 in and perhaps about 4.1 in x 2.4 in x 0.75 in.
 C.      FULL SCREEN DISPLAY
 [0058]         Because the footprint of a multifunctional hand-held device is
 substantially fixed by the intended primary use of the device, it becomes
 important for designers to determine an appropriate layout for the UI. For
 example, some devices may work better with a limited number of buttons and
 a large display while others may work better with a large number of buttons
 or a complete keyboard and a small display.
 [0059]         A preferred multi-functional hand-held device may be configured
 with a full screen display or a near full screen display. A full screen display
 consumes substantially the entire front surface of the device. The display
 may extend edge to edge or may fit within a small bezel of the housing at the
 edge of the device. The full screen display may consumes 90% or more of a
 front surface of a housing for a hand-held electronic device.
 [0060]         The full screen display may have a variety of different
 configurations depending on the overall footprint of the device. If the device
 is wide, the full screen display may have a traditional aspect ratio of about
 4:3. If the device is elongated, the full screen display may have an aspect
 ratio that is more panoramic such as 16:9.
 D.      LIMITED NUMBER OF MECHANICAL ACTUATORS
 [0061]         To accommodate a full screen display, the multi-functional
 hand-held device is preferably configured with a limited number of physical
 buttons.    Because a limited number of physical buttons are provided, the
 hand-held device preferably uses a touch screen as the primary input device.
Touch screens are transparent touch sensing devices that are positioned over
displays. They typically work in conjunction with a GUI presented on the
display. For example, the GUI may present an on-screen button, and the
touch screen may detect when a user presses the on-screen button (e.g.,
                                          11

WO 2006/094308                                                     PCT/US2006/008349
places their finger or stylus over the on-screen button). Touch screens and
GUI's are described in greater detail below.
[0062]          The hand-held device may be constructed with only cross
functional physical buttons, i.e., there are no buttons dedicated to individual
devices. These type of buttons may include power buttons and hold
switches. In another embodiment, the hand-held device may not include any
 physical buttons at all. In some embodiments, the physical buttons are
 limited to only the sides and back surface of the hand-held device. In other
 embodiments, the physical buttons of the hand-held device are limited to the
 upper and lower portion of the sides so that there are no buttons in the
 regions of the sides where a user would physically support the device (i.e.,
 holding region).     In still other embodiments, the physical buttons may be
 located on the front surface, but only in the bezel region surrounding the
 display. In some embodiments, the buttons may be located on only the top
 and bottom surfaces of the device.
  [0063]         Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a substantially full screen multi
 functional hand-held device 120 with a limited number of buttons. There are
  no physical buttons on the front and side surfaces 124 and 126. The front
  surface is used entirely for the display 122. Further, because the sides 126
  are used for grasping the device 120 it may be preferred to leave the sides
  free from buttons to prevent accidental actions in the event a user
  inadvertently presses a button while supporting the device. Although the top
  surface 128 and bottom surface 13 0 would not typically be used to hold the
  device, these surfaces are not ideal locations for buttons that are often
  actuated because it would be awkward to reach these buttons when
  operating the device with one hand.
   [0064]        The top surface 128 may be reserved for buttons that have
   limited action and generic functions that are cross-functional, for example,
   power and hold switches. The top and bottom surfaces 128 and 130 are also
  well suited for placement of I/O and communication ports. The top surface
   128 may, for example, include a headset/microphone jack and an antenna,
   and the bottom surface 130 may include power and data ports.
                                           12

WO 2006/094308                                                    PCT/US2006/008349
[0065]          In some cases, it may be desirable to place buttons in the upper
or lower regions of the side surfaces 126 out of the way of the grasping hand.
This may be particularly well suited for elongated devices that are larger than
the width of the grasping hand. As shown in Fig. 4, the hand-held device 120
includes a button 140 in the upper region on the side surface 126 of the
 hand-held device 120. Because the button 140 is in the upper region, it tends
to be out of the way of the grasping hand and therefore accidental activation
 is substantially eliminated. The upper button may be configured to switch the
functionality of the multi-functional device i.e., button 140 may be switch 110
 of Fig.2. For example, by pressing the button 140, a new device functionality
 is activated, and the current device functionality is deactivated. Although the
 term button is used, it should be appreciated that the button 140 may
 correspond to a dial, wheel, switch and/or the like.
 [0066]          Generally it would be preferred, although not required, to limit
 the number of physical buttons to eight or fewer, and perhaps five or fewer.
 III.    ADAPTABLITY
 [0067]         To limit the number of physical controls on the device (thereby
 maximizing the display area), the multi-functional hand-held device is'
 preferable adaptable, i.e., the device is capable of changing its UI based on
 how the device is to be used. For example, if a cell phone functionality of the
 multi-functional device is to be used, the UI changes to accommodate the cell
 phone. Alternatively, if the PDA aspect of the multi-functional device is to be
 used, the UI changes to accommodate the PDA, etc. In essence, the multi
 functional device is capable of reconfiguring its user interface based on the
 state or mode of the device.
  [0068]         Adaptability may be accomplished by reassigning the functions
 of the limited number of physical buttons for each device functionality. For
 example, a button may perform one function when a first device is activated
 and another when another device is activated. While this may work, it suffers
 from physical limitations (i.e., the number of buttons) and can be confusing to
 the user (who must keep track of different button meanings).
                                         13

WO 2006/094308                                                  PCT/US2006/008349
[0069]         Alternatively adaptability may be accomplished by virtually
incorporating the physical inputs for each functionality into the GUI in
conjunction with a touch screen. This allows the GUI to adapt to whatever
device is selected, and the touch screen can receive inputs corresponding to
the GUI. With a GUI for each functionality, the UI for the hand-held device
adapts such that the multi-function device, in effect, becomes a particular
device. For example, if the cell phone functionality is selected, the GUI
 presents a set of virtual or soft controls that look similar to the physical
 controls typically used on a cell phone, such as a keypad, function buttons
 and possibly a navigation pad, for example.
 [0070]         The entire display may be used to present this information, or
 only a portion of the display may be used for the GUI controls. In the later
 case, referring to Figs. 5-8, the GUI 150 may be separated into a standard
 region 152 and a control region 154. The standard region 152 represents
 what would normally be displayed on the display 122 when using a particular
 device. That is, the standard GUI screens associated with the selected device
 are displayed in the standard region. For example, in the case of the PDA, a
 main menu (window with a set of icons), calendar, address book or date book
 may be displayed in the standard region 152. The control region 154, on the
 other hand, virtually represents the physical controls that would normally be
  physically placed on a particular device. That is, the virtual controls that
  mimic the physical controls are displayed in the control region 154. For
  example, in the case of the PDA, the control region 154 may include virtual
  representations of a hand writing recognition area, a navigation pad and the
  standard function buttons.
  [0071]        The standard and control regions 152 and 154 can be positioned
  at any position on the display 122 (top, bottom, sides, center, etc.). For
  example, as shown in Fig. 5, they may be positioned vertically relative to one
  another (one on top of the other) or as shown in Fig. 6, they may be
  positioned horizontally relative to one another (side by side). These
  configurations can be used in either portrait or landscape modes. By way of
  example, in cases where the device is operated in landscape mode, the
                                         14

 WO 2006/094308                                                    PCT/US2006/008349
standard region 152 may be placed on one side and the control region may
be placed on the opposite side.       Landscape orientation may, for example,
facilitate one handed operation.       In some cases, the side on which the
controls are displayed is based on the handedness of the user. For example,
the controls may be place on the right side for right-handed users, and the
controls may be placed on the left side for left-handed users. Alternatively,
the controls may be placed on both sides as shown in Fig. 7. This
 arrangement is particularly well suited for game playing. Furthermore, the
 amount of area dedicated to each portion may be widely varied. For
 example, the screen may be divided equally and in other cases one or the
 other portion constitutes a greater amount of the display. In some cases, the
 standard region 154 is maximized to increase the normal viewing area of the
 display.
 [0072]         When a particular functionality is selected for use, the hand-held
 device loads the software for the selected functionality and configures the
 GUI 150 including the standard region 152 and the control region 154. The
 controls in the control region 154 can therefore be used to control whatever is
 being shown in the standard region 152. In some cases, the control region
 154 may even change in accordance with the needs of each displayed window
 for the particular device.
 [0073]         Alternatively, as shown in Fig. 8, virtual controls 160 may be
 overlaid on top of the standard region 152 so that the standard region 152
 can fully utilize the entire display 122. In fact, the virtual controls 160 may
 appear and disappear as needed. For example, the user may touch the
 screen and this may drive the device to display the controls over a portion of
 the display including whatever is already displayed. Examples of virtual
  controls that operate in this manner can be found in U.S. Patent Application
  No.: 11/038,590, titled "Mode-Based Graphical User Interfaces for Touch
  Sensitive Input Devices," filed on January 18, 2005.
  A.      GUI BASED ON FUNCTIONALITY
                                         15

WO 2006/094308                                                     PCT/US2006/008349
[0074]         Figs. 9-17 illustrate various examples of GUIs for different
states or modes of the multi-functional device.
[0075]          Fig. 9 is a diagram of a GUI 170 that is used in a PDA mode. As
shown, the GUI is divided into a standard region 152 and a control region
154. Located inside the control region 154 are a virtual handwriting pad 172,
four virtual buttons 174 and a virtual navigation pad 176.
[0076]          Fig. 10 is a diagram of a GUI 180 that is used in a cell phone
mode. As shown, the GUI 180 is divided into a standard region 152 and a
control region 154. Located inside the control region 154 are a virtual keypad
 182, a virtual navigation pad 184 and two virtual buttons 186.
 [0077]         Fig. 11 is a diagram of a GUI 190 that is used in a music player
 mode. As shown, the GUI 190 is divided into a standard region 152 and a
control region 154. Located inside the control region 154 are a virtual scroll
wheel 192 and five virtual buttons 194. Additional details on a virtual scroll
wheel are provided in U.S. Patent Application No.: 11/038,590, titled "Mode
 Based Graphical User Interfaces for Touch Sensitive Input Devices," filed on
January 18, 2005.
 [0078]         Fig. 12 is a diagram of a GUI 200 that is used in a video player
 mode. As shown, the GUI 200 is divided into a standard region 152 and a
 control region 154. Located inside the control region 154 are a plurality of
 virtual buttons 202. Alternatively, the controls may appears and disappears
 as needed since the video player is primarily used in conjunction with a full
 screen viewing mode.
 [0079]         Fig. 13 is a diagram of a GUI 210 that is used in a game player
 mode. As shown, the GUI 210 is divided into a standard region 152 and two
 control regions 154A and 154B on the sides of the standard region 152. The
 left side control region 154A includes a navigation or directional pad 212, and
 the right side control region includes four virtual buttons 214 (or vice versa
 depending on the users particular needs, left or right handed).
 [0080]         Fig. 14 is a diagram of a GUI 220 that is used in a camera
 mode. As shown, the GUI 220 is divided into a standard region 152 and a
 control region 154. The standard region 152 may represent the view finder.

Located inside the control region 154 are various buttons 222 including for
example picture click, zoom, flash, etc. A navigation pad 224 may also be
included so that the pictures can be scrolled through or for menu navigation.
[0081]         Fig. 15 is a diagram of a GUI 230 that is used in a GPS receiver
mode. As shown, the GUI 230 is divided into a standard region 152 and a

222 including for example zoom, pan, etc. A navigation pad 224 may also be
included.

control mode. As shown, the GUI 250 is divided into a standard region 152
and a control region 154. Located inside the control region 154 are various
keys and buttons 252 associated with controlling a remote device such as a
TV, DVD player, A/V amplifier, VHS, CD player, etc.
B.     SWITCHING BETWEEN DEVICES (GUI)
[0084]         Before a particular device functionality can be used, it typically
must be selected for use. The selection can come in a variety of forms. For
example, the selection may be made via a main menu that includes soft
buttons or icons that, when selected, activate the device functionality
associated with the soft button. During activation, the GUI for that particular
device is brought into view on the display (see Figs. 9-17) and the software
associated with the device is installed, loaded or activated. From that point
on, the multi-functional device operates like the selected device.
[0085]         Fig. 18 illustrated an exemplary main menu GUI 260 of a multi
functional device.    As shown, the GUI 260 includes icons/buttons 262 for
launching each of the various device functionalities.         In this particular
example, the main menu page 260 includes a PDA button 262A, a cell phone
button 262B, a music player button 262C, a game player button 262D, a
                                         17

WO 2006/094308                                                   PCT/US2006/008349
video player button 262E, a GPS button 262F, a remote control button 262G,
 a camera button 262H and a handtop button 2621. The various buttons 262
 are virtual buttons. When a button is pressed, the main page for the selected
 functionally (e.g., as shown in Figs. 9-17) is brought into view on the display.
To select another device, the user simply selects a soft home button 264
 located in the GUI of each device to return to the main menu page 260, and
thereafter selects the desired functionality in the main menu page 260.
 [0086]        The selection of alternative       functionalities may also     be
 accomplished by flipping (or scrolling) through the various GUIs until the
 desired GUI is found. For example, the different GUIs may be incrementally
 brought into view page after page (or frame after frame) when a next (flip)
 command signal is generated (e.g., slide show effect).           The transition
 between pages may be widely varied. The transition may be from side to
 side, top to bottom or center to center.       The transition may also include
fading in and out, popping in and out, or enlarging and reducing.             The
command signal may be generated by a physical or virtual button or wheel.
 Using a button, each press may cause a new page to be displayed. Using a
wheel, a predetermined amount of rotation may cause a new page to be
displayed.
 [0087]        The command signal may also be generated in a variety of other
ways. For example, the command signal may also be generated by gestures
initiated on the touch screen. For example, sliding a finger (or stylus) across
the display may cause a new page to be displayed. If slid to the right, the
next page may be displayed. If slid to the left, the previous page may be
displayed.     The command signal may also be generated by 3D device
gestures created when the entire hand-held device is moved spatially.          By
way of example, shaking the device may cause a new page to be displayed.
[0088]         The command signal may also be generated by forces that are
applied to the device. By way of example, squeezing the device may cause a
new page to be displayed. The command signal may also be generated by
sensing the orientation of the device either relative to the ground, as sensed
by accelerometers, or relative to a compass direction indicated by an internal
                                        18

WO 2006/094308                                                   PCT/US2006/008349
compass. For example, if the device is at 0 degrees, a first page is displayed,
at 90 degrees a second page is displayed, at 180 degrees a third page is
displayed and at 270 degrees a fourth page is displayed.
[0089] -       The command signal may also be generated by monitoring a
user's voice (i.e., voice recognition). If the user calls out "PHONE," the page
associated with the phone is displayed, if the user calls out "PDA," the page
associated with the PDA is displayed.
[0090]         The command signal may also be generated by monitoring
incoming signals from other systems (whether transmitted wirelessly or via a
cable).    For example, if a call is received, the device may automatically
configure the system as a phone. Alternatively, it may only present a control
panel for taking or passing on the call.
 [0091]        As an alternative to integrating functionalities, the device may
be configured to keep the various modes separate. That is, the device does
not merge the functionality together (integrated layers and GUIs), but instead.
keeps them distinct from one another. In some cases, by keeping different
functionalities distinct, user confusion may be reduced.
C.      OPERATING AT LEAST TWO FUNCTIONALITIES SIMULTANEOUSLY
[0092]         Preferably, the user may be able to activate two or more device
functionalities simultaneously. In such a case, the software for the multiple
functionalities is activated simultaneously and the display operates in a split
screen mode where the screen is parsed into different sections, each section
including a particular device GUI. Generally this would require the GUI for
each functionality to fit on the screen.      The multi-function mode may be
selected in a variety of ways.         In one implementation, when the user
simultaneously touches two or more device icons, the device activates the
multiple device functionalities and brings the appropriate GUIs into view on
the screen.
D.      CONFIGURABLE GUI (USER PREFERENCES)
[0093]         The GUI control panels for each device functionality may be
configurable by the user. For example, the user may design or customize his
                                         19

WO 2006/094308                                                  PCT/US2006/008349
 own UI for each device, and assign functions to the various elements of the
 UI.    The functions may include initiating commands, selecting an item,
 opening a file or document, launching a program, executing instructions,
 viewing a menu on the display screen, etc. The parameters configurable by
 the user may include selecting the number and type of GUI elements
 (buttons) as well as the location of the GUI elements on the page. In some
 cases, the system may include a design palette that allows a user to review
 and/or customize the UI layout, i.e., the user may quickly and conveniently
 review    preconfigured or default layout and make changes thereto. Once
 changed, the modified layout will be automatically saved and thereby
 employed to handle future events.
 IV.     INPUT DEVICES
 [0094]        There are a number of problems with current input devices for
 hand-held computers.     For example, there is no realistic way to fit all the
 dedicated physical buttons that are needed for each device because more and
 more buttons must be fit into a small space. A related problem arises in that
 as more physical buttons are incorporated into the device, the buttons must
 get closer together thereby challenging the dexterity of the               user.
 Furthermore, because physical buttons stick out they are often accidentally
 activated during normal use or while the device is transported e.g., in a user's
 pocket. Finally, large numbers of small physical buttons can be confusing to
the user as well as aesthetically unpleasing.
 [0095]        To overcome these and other problems a variety of alternative
 inputs arrangements are proposed (in addition to or in place of physical
 buttons, switches, etc.). The basic idea is to reduce the number of physical
and mechanical input mechanisms (and therefore the amount of dedicated
space needed on the surface of the device) and/or eliminate the physical and
mechanical input mechanisms altogether.        By reducing or eliminating the
physical input devices, the display of the electronic device can be maximized,
or alternatively the size of the electronic device can be minimized.
Furthermore, such a device is more aesthetically pleasing. In some cases, the
                                       20

WO 2006/094308                                                     PCT/US2006/008349
  hand-held device can be configured so that it appears to only have a display
  and no dedicated physical input devices.
  [0096]        The alternative input means may also be hidden from view such~
  that they are not visible to the user. As a result, the hand-held electronic
  device may appear to only have a display with no visible buttons, switches,
  etc. Such a device is more aesthetically pleasing (e.g., may comprise smooth
  surfaces with no breaks gaps or lines), and, in many cases, can be made
  smaller without sacrificing screen size and input functionality.
 A.      TOUCH SCREEN
  [0097]        One particularly suitable input arrangement is a touch screen. A
 touch screen in conjunction with GUI may be configured as the primary input
 arrangement for a hand-held device. A touch screen is basically a transparent
 input panel positioned in front of the display. A touch screen generates input
 signals when an object such as a finger or stylus touches or is moved across
 the surface of the touch screen. In most cases, touch screens allow a user to
 make selections and initiate movements in a GUI by simply touching the
 display screen via a finger. For example, a user may make a selection by
 pointing directly to a graphical object displayed on the display screen.
 Corresponding to an on-screen button for performing specific actions in the
 hand-held electronic device. In general, the touch screen recognizes the
 touch and position of the touch on the display and a controller of the hand
 held electronic device interprets the touch and thereafter performs an action
 based on the touch event. There are several types of touch screen
technologies including resistive, capacitive, infrared and surface acoustic
wave.
[0098]         A preferred touch screen for a multi-functional hand-held
computer is a multipoint capacitive touch screen. Such a touch screen
comprises several independent and spatially distinct sensing points, nodes, or
regions that are positioned throughout the touch screen. The sensing points
are dispersed about the touch screen with each sensing point representing a
different position on the surface of the touch screen. The sensing points may
                                         21

WO 2006/094308                                                   PCT/US2006/008349
  be positioned in a grid or a pixel array where each sensing point is capable of
  generating a signal. A signal is produced each time an object is positioned
  over a sensing point. When an object is placed over multiple sensing points
  or when the object is moved between or over multiple sensing point, multiple
  signals can be generated. The sensing points generally map the touch screen
  plane into a coordinate system such as a Cartesian coordinate system or polar
 coordinate system. One example of such a touch screen is disclosed in U.S.

  B.     TOUCH SENSITIVE HOUSING
  [0099]        A hand-held electronic device may also incorporate one or more
 include a touch sensitive surfaces of the device housing itself that provide
 either a larger surface for tracking touch inputs or smaller dedicated areas
 such as touch buttons for performing dedicated functions. Such surfaces may
 be located on any surface of the housing, any side of the housing, any portion
 of any side of the housing or at dedicated locations on the surface of the
 housing. For example, the touch regions may be located on the sides or back
 surface of the housing, and may even be located at the bezel located at the
 front surface of the housing. In all of these cases, a large portion of the front
 surface of the housing is saved for the display so that the viewing area of the
 hand-held electronic device can be maximized. The touch sensitive surfaces
 of the housing may take the form of one or more touch panels that are
 positioned within the housing.         The touch sensitive surface may be
alternatively or additionally be provided directly by the housing. That is, the
touch sensing components may be integrated or incorporated into or disposed
underneath the housing such that the housing itself is the touch sensing
device (rather than using a separate touch panel). Similarly to a touch
screen, a touch sensitive housing recognizes the touch and position of a touch
on the surface and a controller of the hand-held electronic device interprets
the touch and thereafter performs an action based on the touch event.

 Touch surfaces are constructed in basically the same manner as a touch
 screen, except the surfaces need not be substantially transparent.
 [0100]         By way of example, the touch sensitive housing may generally
 correspond to the touch sensitive housing described in greater detail U. S.

 Multiple Touch Sensing Devices," filed April 26, 2005.
 C.      DISPLAY ACTUATOR
 [0101]         A hand-held multi-functional electronic device may also include
 a display actuator, which is an input device that mechanically uses the display
 of the hand-held device to provide inputs into the device (rather than
 electrically as with a touch screen).      The display actuator may be used
 separately or in combination with the touch screen. The display actuator may
 include a movable display that causes one or more input signals to be
 generated when moved.        The input signals then can be used to initiate
 commands, make selections, or control motion in a display.
 [0102]        The movable display may be configured to translate, slide, pivot,
 and/or rotate relative to the frame. The display is typically movable relative
to a frame or housing that movably supports the display in its various
 positions. In some cases, the display is movably coupled to the frame, and in
 other cases the frame movably restrains a floating display.
 [0103]        The input signals may be generated by movement indicator(s)
that monitor the movements of the display and produces signals indicative of
such movements. The detection mechanism may, for example, one or more
switches, sensors, encoders, and/or the like.          Any suitable mechanical,
electrical and/or optical switch, sensor or encoder may be used. For example,
tact switches, force sensitive resistors, pressure sensors, proximity sensors,
infrared sensors, mechanical or optical encoders and/or the like may be used.
The movement indicators may be placed underneath the display or at the
sides of the display as appropriate.        Alternatively or additionally, these
movement indicators may be attached to the display or some component of
the display.

 2005.
 D.     PRESSURE OR FORCE SENSING DEVICES
 [0105]        The multi-functional hand-held electronic device described
above may further include force or pressure sensing devices such as a force
sensing display or housing.
 1.     Force Sensitive Display
 [0106]        A force sensitive display causes one or more input signals to be
generated when pressure is exerted on the display screen of the device. The
input signals can be used to initiate commands, make selections, or control
 motion in a display. Such displays generally provide a slight amount of flex
(unnoticeable to the user) so, that any forces exerted thereon can be
measured by a force detection arrangement generally provided underneath
the display. The force detection arrangement monitors the forces exerted on
the display and produces signals indicative thereof.         The force detection
arrangement may include one or more force sensors such as force sensitive
resistors, force sensitive capacitors, load cells, pressure plates, piezoelectric
transducers, strain gauges, etc. The force sensors may be attached to the
back of the display or to a structural platform located within the housing of
the device. When a force is applied to the display, it is transmitted through
the display to the force sensor located underneath the display.
[0107]          Fig. 19 is a side elevation view, in cross section, of a hand-held
device 300 incorporating a force sensitive display 302. The force sensitive
display 302 includes a display 308 and one or more force sensors 310
disposed underneath the display 308 (between the display and a structural
platform 306).     In most cases, the force sensitive display 302 includes a
plurality of sensors 310 that are laid out in an array.          For example, the
sensors 310 may be positioned side by side in rows and columns. The force
sensors 310 measure the amount of force being applied to the display and
when a desired force threshold is reached a control signal is generated. In
                                         24

WO 2006/094308                                                 PCT/US2006/008349
 some cases, an elastomer 312 is placed between the display and the
 structural platform to help transmit the force being exerted on the surface of
 the display to the force sensors disposed below the display.
 [0108]         Force sensing may be provided in conjunction with a touch
 screen to differentiate between light and hard touches. The determination of
 whether a touch is a light touch or a hard touch may be made by monitoring
 the force with the force sensors and comparing the force to a predetermined
 threshold. When the force threshold is not exceeded, the touch is considered
 a light touch. When the force threshold is exceeded, the touch is considered
 a hard touch. Each type of touch may be used to control different aspects of
 the device.    Light touches may be associated with passive events such as
 navigation (e.g., cursor control scrolling, panning, zoom, rotation, etc.) and
 hard touches may be associated with active events such as selections or
 commands (e.g., button click).
 [0109]        Fig. 20 illustrates an input device 320 that combines touch
 sensing and force sensing devices to provide x, y and z components when
touched. The touch sensing device provides position sensing in the x and y
 directions, and the force sensing device provides force sensing in the z
direction.   These devices cooperate to output x, y location and z pressure
 information whenever there is a touch on the touch surface.
 [0110]        Fig. 21 is a side elevation view of an I/O device 330 that
combines a display 332 with touch screen 334 and a force sensing mechanism
336. The touch screen 334 provides high resolution touch locations, and the
force sensing mechanism 336 provides a measure of where the force is
coming from as well the total force. Touch screen 334 is disposed over the
display 332, and the force sensing mechanism 336 is disposed below the
display 332 although other arrangements are possible.
[0111]         Force sensing mechanism 336 may also be widely varied. In the
illustrated embodiment, the force sensing mechanism 336 is based on
capacitance, and more particularly, self capacitance.     The illustrated force
sensing mechanism 336 is formed from various layers including an electrode
layer 338, an elastomer layer 340 and a conductive layer 342.
                                       25

WO 2006/094308                                                    PCT/US2006/008349
[0112]          Electrode layer 338 includes a plurality of spatially separated
electrodes 339 that are positioned across the bottom of the display 332.
Electrodes 339 are typically positioned in an array of rows and columns
although often configuring are possible. Any number of electrodes may be
used.
[0113]          Elastomer layer 340 includes one or more elastic members 341
positioned between the electrode layer 338 and the conductive layer 342.
Elastic members 341 allow the display 332 to move inwardly with a limited
amount of displacement. In one implementation, elastic members 441 are
silicone patches with a thickness of about 0.2 mm.
 [0114]         Conductive layer 342 typically takes the form of a grounded
 metal plate 343.       A capacitive circuit is formed between each of the
electrodes 339 and the grounded metal plate 343. When a user pushes down
on the display 332, the force being exerted thereon causes the display 332 to
displace inwardly against the elastic members 341 compressing the elastic
 members. This causes a change in the capacitance between the electrodes
 339 and the metal plate 343.        This change in capacitance is sensed by a
 control circuit operatively coupled to each of the electrodes 339. Capacitance
 sensing circuits are disclosed in the various incorporated references.
 [0115]         Fig. 22 is a side elevation view of an input device 350 that may
 be positioned over a display. The input device 350 combines touch sensing
 and force sensing into a single device. In this embodiment, both the touch
 sensing and force sensing is provided by mutual capacitance. As shown, the
 input device 350 is formed from various layers including a top drive layer 352,
 a middle sense layer 354, and a bottom drive layer 356. Furthermore, the
 middle sense layer 354 is positioned on an elastomer layer 358 disposed
 between the middle sense layer 354 and the bottom drive layer 356. The top
 and bottom drive layers 353 and 356 include a plurality of spatially separated
 lines in rows and the middle sense layer 354 includes a plurality of spatially
 separated lines in columns. The top and middle layers 352 and 354 therefore
form a grid, and the bottom and middle layers 356 and 354 form a grid.
                                          26

WO 2006/094308                                                    PCT/US2006/008349
 [0116]        During operation, the lines on the top layer 352 are scanned,
and thereafter the lines on the bottom layer 356 are scanned (or vice versa).
When there is a touch, the mutual capacitance measured between the top
drive layer 352 and the middle sense layer 354 provide the x and y location of
the touch.      In addition, the mutual capacitance measured between the
 bottom drive layer 356 and the middle sense layer 354 provide the amount of
force of the touch. This particular arrangement provides a full image of force
superimposed on a full image of touch. The input device including the touch
 layers and the force layers may be operated similarly to the methods
described in U.S. Patent Application No.: 10/840,862, titled "Multipoint Touch
Screen," filed on May 6, 2004.
 2.      Force Sensitive Housing
 [0117]        The hand-held device may also include a force sensitive
 housing. The force sensitive housing provides inputs when forces are applied
to the housing of the hand-held device. A force sensitive housing is similar to
 a force sensitive screen in that. The housing provides a slight amount of flex
 (possibly unnoticeable to the user) so that any forces exerted thereon can be
 distributed to a force detection arrangement located within the housing. The
force detection arrangement monitors the forces on the housing and produces
 signals indicative thereof. As with the force sensitive display discussed above,
the force detection mechanism may include one or more force sensors
 disposed with in the housing such as force sensitive resistors, force sensitive
 capacitors, load cells, pressure plates, piezoelectric transducers, strain gauges
and/or the like. When a force is applied to the housing (squeezing or pushing
on the housing), it is transmitted through the housing to the force sensor
 located within the housing.
 [0118]        The force sensitive portions of the housing may be located on
any surface of the housing, any side of the housing, any portion of any side of
the housing or at dedicated locations on the surface of the housing.           The
sides of the housing are ideal places for implementing a squeeze feature.
This is because the users fingers are typically positioned on one side of the
                                         27

WO 2006/094308                                                   PCT/US2006/008349
device and thumb on the other and therefore the hand may easily squeeze
the sides via a pinching action. Because it is so convenient to activate the
squeeze feature, special care must be taken when designing the squeeze
feature so that it will not be accidentally activate during normal use. Thus the
device needs to be able to differentiate between light and hard squeezes. If
the squeeze feature is implemented using force sensitive resistors (FSRs)
which exhibit, a decrease in resistance with an increase in force applied to the
active surface a comparator circuit can be used to output a signal to indicate
activation when a preset force threshold is reached.
 [0119]        Fig. 23 is a side view, in cross section, of a hand-held device
 370 that incorporates a squeeze feature. As shown, the device 370 includes a
 housing 372 and a support platform 374 inside the housing 372. Between the
 support platform 374 and the inner surface of the housing 372 are a pair of
 force sensors 376. When a force is applied to the housing 372 as for example
 by the pinching nature of the hand, the housing 372 flexes inwardly under the
 pressure. This causes the force sensors 376 to be sandwiched between the
 housing 372 and the support platform 374. The force sensors 376 measure
 the amount of force being exerted and when a desired force threshold is
 reached, the force sensors 376 generate a control signal. For example, as a
 result of being sandwiched, a force resistive sensor may exhibit a reduced
 resistance and when a desired threshold is reached, a control signal is
 generated.
 [0120]        The force sensitive housing may be is provided in conjunction
 with a touch sensitive housing as discussed above.
 E.     MOTION ACTUATED INPUT DEVICE
 [0121]        The hand-held electronic device may also include a motion
 actuated input device.      The motion actuated input device provides inputs
 when the hand-held device is in motion or is placed in a certain orientation. A
 motion actuated input device typically includes a motion sensor, such as an
 accelerometer, that monitors the motion of the device along the x, y, and/or z
 axis and produces signals indicative thereof. The motion sensor may, for
                                         28

WO 2006/094308                                                    PCT/US2006/008349
example, include an accelerometer. Alternatively, the motion sensor could be
an orientation sensor, such as an electronic compass, that allows the device
to determine its orientation in a generally horizontal plane.        The motion
sensors may be attached to the housing or to some other structural
component located within the housing of the device. When motion is applied
to the device (gesturing, shaking, hand waving, etc.), it is transmitted
through the housing to the motion sensor.
[0122]         Because motion sensors typically measure all motion, not just
intended motion, the intended motion information typically must be separated
from the other motion information to produce an accurate command signal.
 For example, large scale movements such as shaking the device will produce
 primarily low frequency information.       Conversely, small scale movements,
such as vibrations, primarily produce high frequency information. The high
frequency information can be filtered out thereby leaving only low frequency
 information indicative of the large scale movements (e.g., shaking).         The
filtered information can then be converted into a control signal.
 [0123]        Fig. 24 is a side view, in cross section, of a hand-held electronic
 device 380. The hand-held device 380 includes an accelerometer 382 that is
 attached to a housing 384 of the hand-held device 380. When the device 380
 is moved about by the user, the accelerometer 382 recognizes the motion and
 a controller of the hand-held electronic device 380 interprets the motion and
 thereafter performs an action based on the motion event.
 F.     MECHANICAL ACTUATORS
 [0124]        While one would like to eliminate all surface mounted actuators
 such as buttons and wheels, it is sometimes impractical. Therefore the hand
 held device may include some number of surface mounted actuators.
 Preferably, these actuators are generic to each of the integrated devices.
That is, their meaning is the same regardless of what device functionality is
 activated. It is also preferred that the surface mounted actuators be placed
 on surfaces other than the front surface, which houses the viewing region of
 the display, although this is not required.
                                         29

WO 2006/094308                                                   PCT/US2006/008349
[0125]         One particularly useful mechanical actuator is a hold switch.
The hold switch may be configured to activate and deactivate the primary
input means, e.g., the touch screen.          This permits a user to prevent
unwanted entries, for example, when the device is stored inside a user's
pocket. In one implementation, the hold switch may be placed on the top
surface out of the way of the grasping hand, but in a position for easy access
(as opposed to the bottom surface). The hold switch can not only deactivate
the touch screen but also mechanical actuators and other input and other
input devices.
[0126]         Another particularly useful mechanical actuator is a power
switch. When the power switch is turned on, the device is powered up and
ready to go. When the power switch is turned off, the device is shut down.
In one implementation, the power switch may be placed on the top surface
out of the way of the grasping hand, but in a position for easy access (as
opposed to the bottom surface).
 [0127]        Another useful mechanical actuator is a navigation pad.       The
 navigation pad is typically included with many hand-held devices.           The
functionality of the navigation pad may be changed according to the current
 operating mode of the device. In the case of a music player, for example, the
 directional keys may be assigned, play/pause, next, previous, and volume up
 and down. Other assignable buttons may also be included on the device.
 [0128]         Still another useful mechanical actuator is a switching actuator.
The switching actuator may be configured to change the functionality of the
 device, i.e., by activating the switching actuator the functionality or state of
 the device switches from one mode to another. The switching actuator may
 be widely varied.
 [0129]         For example, the switching actuator may be a dial or wheel. By
 incrementally rotating the wheel, the device is incrementally switched from
 one device to the other (generally in some predetermined order).           A full
 rotation of each device generally cycles through the entire group of integrated
 devices.   The wheel or dial may for example operate like a scroll wheel.
 Although the placement may be widely varied, the switching wheel may be
                                        30

WO 2006/094308                                                     PCT/US2006/008349
placed in the upper region of the sides of the device. By placing the wheel
here, a users thumb may be used to easily rotate the wheel. For example,
the users thumb may be extended from the grasping action so that the wheel
can be rotated.
[0130]         Alternatively, the switching actuator may be a button. By
repetitively pressing on the button, the device is switched from one device to
another (generally in some predetermined order). Although the placement
may be widely varied, the switching button may be placed in the upper region
of the sides of the device. By placing the button here, a users thumb or index
finger may be used to easily press the button.
 [0131]        The hand-held device may also include any commercially
 available touch pad. Several examples of touch pads may be found in U.S.
 Patent Application No.: 10/188,182, titled "Touch Pad for Handheld Device,"
 filed on July 1, 2002, U.S. Patent Application No.: 10/722,948, titled "Touch
 Pad for Handheld Device," filed on November 25, 2003, and U.S. Patent
 Application   No.:   10/643,256, titled "Movable       Touch Pad with Added
 Functionality," filed on August 18, 2003.
 [0132]        In another embodiment, the hand-held device may include a
 scroll wheel. Scroll wheels can be used in each functionality to scroll through
 a window.
 G.      MICROPHONE
  [0133]       The hand-held device may also include a microphone that picks
  up audio sounds. The microphone may be used in conjunction with a cell
  phone to transmit sounds, such as the user's voice. The microphone may
  also be used to record sounds or enter voice commands into the hand-held
  device. For example, using voice recognition software, the hand-held device
  may be able to recognize voice commands and generated control signals
  associated therewith. The microphone may be placed in the bottom surface
  of the hand-held device or possible in the front lower bezel. This particular
  configuration is well suited for picking up a user's voice during a phone call.
  H.     IMAGE SENSOR
                                           31

WO 2006/094308                                                  PCT/US2006/008349
[0134]         A hand-held electronic device may also include an image sensor
and lens related components so that the hand-held device can operate like a
camera.     The image sensor may, for example, include a charge coupled
device (CCD) camera.
I.      INPUT DEVICE FUNCTIONALITY
1.      TOUCH GESTURES
[0135]         A hand-held electronic device may be designed to recognize
touch gestures applied to a touch screen.and/or touch sensitive surface of the
housing and thereby control aspects of the hand-held electronic device.
Gestures are a stylized interaction with an input device that is mapped to one
or more specific computing operations. The gestures may be made through
various hand and finger motions.        Gestures generally comprise a contact
chord e.g., one or more fingers, and a motion associated with the chord.
Alternatively or additionally, the gestures may be made with a stylus. In all of
these cases, the input device i.e., touch screen and/or touch sensitive
surface) receive the gestures and a controller of the hand-held electronic
device executes instructions to carry out operations associated with the
gestures.     The hand-held electronic device may include a touch gesture
operational program, which may be part of the operating system or a
separate application. The gesture operation program generally includes a set
of instructions that recognizes the occurrence of gestures and informs one or
 more software agents of the gestures and/or what action(s) to take in
 response to the gestures.       For example, gestures that can be used are
disclosed in greater detail in U.S.    Patent Application No: 10/903,964, titled
"Gestures for Touch Sensitive Input Devices," filed on July 30, 2004, and U.S.
 Patent Application No.: 11/038,590, titled "Mode-Based          Graphical User
 Interfaces for Touch Sensitive Input Devices," filed on January 18, 2005.
 2.      3-D SPATIAL GESTURES
 [0136]        In accordance with one embodiment, the hand-held electronic
 device may be designed to recognize 3-D spatial gestures measured by an
                                         32

WO 2006/094308                                                   PCT/US2006/008349
accelerometer and to control aspects of the hand-held electronic device based
on the 3-D spatial gestures. Spatial gestures are stylized motions of the
device itself that are mapped to one or more specific computing operations.
The 3-D spatial gestures may be made through various hand and arm
motions, such as for example shaking, waving and the like.                   The
accelerometer measures the motion related to the 3-D spatial gestures and a
controller recognizes the motion as a 3-D spatial gesture and thereafter
executes instructions to carry out operations associated with the 3-D spatial
gestures. The hand-held electronic device may include a 3-D spatial gesture
operational program, which may be part of the operating system or a
separate application. The gesture operation, program generally includes a set
of instructions that recognizes the occurrence of gestures and informs one or
 more software agents of the gestures and/or what action(s) to take in
 response to the gestures.
 [0137]         One exemplary 3-D gesture is shaking the device. Shaking can
 cause the hand-held device causes the device to shift between modes or
 states. Alternatively, shaking the hand-held device can cause a selection
 event to occur.    For example, in the case of a media player, shaking the
 device may cause the device to randomly select a picture or song in group of
 pictures or songs. Alternatively, shaking the device may cause the device to
 select the next picture or song in a sequence of songs.
  [0138]        Other gestures may include translating or rotating the device.
 Translating the hand-held device (while it is face up) from side to side may be
  used to initiate panning or scrolling in the device, or moving the device up
  and down (while it is face up) may be used to initiate zooming. Rotating the
  device may be used to cause the device to change modes or states. In some
  cases, for example, the orientation of the device may correspond to a
  particular mode. For example, a first mode may be associated with 0
  degrees, a second mode may be associated with 90 degrees, a third mode
  may be associated with 180 degrees and a fourth mode may be associated
  with 270 degrees. In all these cases, the device can be configured to keep
                                         33

 WO 2006/094308                                                   PCT/US2006/008349
the displayed portion upright as the device is turned. That is, it maintains an
upright image no matter what orientation the device is in.
[0139]          The 3-D spatial gestures may even be based on more complex
motions such as sign language, writing motions, etc.
3.        PERFORM ACTION BASED ON MULTIPLE INPUTS
 [0140]         Because the device may have multiple input modes, the hand
 held device may be configured to receive simultaneous inputs from different
 inputs devices, and perform actions based on the multiple simultaneous
 inputs. The inputs that may be combined to produce new commands may be
 selected from voice, 2-D touch gestures, 3-D spatial gestures, actuators, etc.
 For example, this feature may be helpful when making calls via voice
 selection.    A caller may verbalize "TOM," which causes the device to dial
 "TOM" phone number. If "TOM" has multiple phone numbers, a user may
  combine the verbal command "TOM" with a 3-D spatial gesture such as
  shaking to select Tom's second phone number. Various other possibilities will
  be appreciated by those skilled in the art.
  4.       DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN LIGHT AND HARD TOUCHES
  [0141]         As noted above, force sensing in conjunction with touch sensing
  facilitates two distinct types of interactions, light touches and hard touches.
  Light touches may be used to perform passive actions such as navigating
  through content and content manipulation generally without causing a major
  event to occur. Examples of passive events include moving a cursor,
  scrolling, panning, etc. Hard touch interactions may be used to select on
  screen buttons or initiate commands (e.g., causes a significant change to
  occur).
   [0142]        Fig. 25 is a diagram of a touch method 400for implementing this
  technique. The method 400 begins at block 402 where one or more touches
   are detected. The touches include not only x any y components but also z
   components. The x and y components may be supplied by a touch sensing
   device such as touch screen, touch pad, or touch housing. The z component

  WO 2006/094308                                                    PCT/US2006/008349
                                                             located behind the

                                                                          where a
[0143]          Following block 402, the method proceeds to block 404
                                                                               The
determination is made as to whether the touch is a light or hard touch.
determination is generally based on the force or pressure of the touch (z
                                                               is smaller than a
component). For example, if the force of the touch
                                                                  touch and if the
 predetermined threshold then the touch is considered a light
 force of the touch is larger than the predetermined threshold then the touch
 is considered a hard touch. If it is determined that the touch is a light touch,
                                                                                the
 the method proceeds to block 406 where a passive action associated with
 touch is initiated. If it is determined that the touch is hard touch, an active
  action associated with the touch is performed (block 408).
                                                                                the
  [0144]        The touch method may additionally include a block where
  one or more touches are classified as a primary touch or a secondary touch.
  Primary touches are touches that are intended to cause an action while
  secondary touches are touches that are not intended to cause an action.
                                                                                 the
  Gestures are examples of primary touches while a thumb positioned over
                                                                                 the
  touch area to hold the device is an example of a secondary touch. Once
                                                                                  are
  touches are classified as primary or secondary, the secondary touches
  filtered out, and the determination of whether a touch is a light or hard touch
  is made with the primary touches.
  5.      EXAMPLE OF A NEW TOUCH VOCABULARY
                                                                                   be
   [0145]        The z pressure exerted on a touch sensing device can
   combined with the x and y locations of the touch to form a new touch
   vocabulary. As should be appreciated, up to this point touch vocabularies
   have only included x and y locations, not z pressure. A proposed touch
                                                                                    of
   vocabulary includes variety of variables including the UI mode, the force
                                                                                  not
   the touch (e.g., light or hard), the number of fingers used, whether or
   there is any movement during the touch, the duration of the touch, and the
   touch location, all or some of which can be combined to form a variety of
   behaviors and user feedback.

  WO 2006/094308                                                   PCT/US2006/008349
                                                                     state of the
[0146]          The UI mode is generally related to the mode or
                                                                         require a
device. Each device includes a variety of states and each state may
                                                                              a set
different UI mode. A media player (a mode) may, for example, include
of hierarchal layers (states) with each layer requiring a different UI.
[0147]           As noted above, the force of the touch may, for example, be
described as light or hard. A light touch may occur when a user lightly
                                                                             of the
touches the surface of the touch surface, i.e., the finger hovers on top
surface and is primarily moved in the x and y directions. A hard touch may
                                                                                  of
 occur when a user presses on the touch surface with a certain amount
                                                                             touch
 force, i.e., the finger is primarily moved in the z direction against the
 surface.
 [0148]           Motion during the touch is used to describe whether the finger
                                                                                  in
  has remained stationary during a touch event or has substantially moved
 the X-Y plane (e.g., translation, rotation,- etc.). The motion may be described
  as none at all or a swipe or twist in some particular direction. By way of
                                                                some combination
  example, the swipe may be up, down, right, left, or
  thereof, and the twist may be clockwise or counterclockwise.
   [0149]         Duration is defined as the amount of time the finger stays at
                                                           include states such as
  any one point. Duration may be variable or it may
                                                                            specific
   short and long. The touch location may be a random point or a
   location such as an onscreen button.
   [0150]         Fig. 26 is an additional touch method 500 implementing this
                                                                                  are
   technique. The method begins at block 502 when one or more touches
   detected. Thereafter, in block 504, the UI mode is determined. In block 506,
                                                                                 hard
   a determination is made as to whether the touches are light touches or
   touches. Alternatively, blocks 502 and 504 could be reversed, effectively
    resulting in an instance of the touch method for each mode. In block 508,
   the number of distinct touches (e.g., fingers) is determined. In block 510, a
    determination is made as to whether the touches are stationary or in motion.
    In block 512, the duration of the touches is determined. In block 514, the
    locations of the touches are determined. Following blocks 502-514, the
                                                                           on the UI
    method proceeds to block 516 where- an action is performed based

mode, the pressure of the touch, the number of touches, whether or not the
touch is moving, the duration of the touch, and the touch location. The
actions may be passive or active depending on the values of each
characteristic.
[0151]         One example of a touch vocabulary associated with a music
player is shown in Figs. 27A-E.
V.      OUTPUT DEVICES
A.      DISPLAY
 [0152]        The principle output of a hand-held electronic device is typically
 a display.    The display provides visual information in the form of text,
 characters or graphics. The display is usually a flat panel device although
 other types of displays may be used. The display may be a liquid crystal
 display (LCD) such as a character LCD that is capable of presenting text and
 symbols or a graphical LCD that is capable of presenting images, video, and
 graphical user interfaces (GUI). Alternatively, the display may correspond to
 a display based on organic light emitting diodes (OLED), or a display that is
 based on electronic inks.
 [0153]         Preferably, the display may be configured to substantially fill the
 front surface of the housing. The display may extend from one edge of the
 housing to the opposite edge of the housing, the housing may include a small
 bezel that surrounds the edges of the display. In either case, the display
 makes up a substantial portion of the front surface of the hand-held electronic
 device, thereby eliminating any space for buttons or switches associated with
 a conventional user interface.
 [0154]         As mentioned above, besides outputting visual information, the
 display may also act like an input device. For example, a touch screen may
 be positioned over the display, and/or sensors may be disposed underneath
 the display to sense when the device is pressed or otherwise moved. In most
 cases, the small form factor of hand-held devices requires central placement
 of the input interfaces to permit operation while being carried around and
                                         37

WO 2006/094308                                                  PCT/US2006/008349
used by the hand. The display region provides a central location, which can
be accessed by both the left and right hands.
[0155]         The display region may be formed by more than one display.
For example, the display region may be formed by a pair of displays that are
side by side or one on top of the other.       A first display may be used to
present the standard screen and a second display may be used to present the
control screen as described above with reference to Figs. 5-8. Furthermore,
a first display may be a conventional display while the second display may be
a display actuator. Moreover, a first display may comprise of a first type and
a second display may be of a second type. For example, the first display may
be an LCD while the second display may be a display based on electronic inks.
[0156]         The decision to use different types may be based on the fact
that one of the displays may be dedicated to a standard viewing area while
another may be dedicated to a control area. Because these two areas require
different resolutions, a higher resolution screen may be used in the standard
area while a lower resolution screen may be used in the control area.
Alternatively or additionally, one of the displays may be selected to reduce
battery consumption especially in the control area where lower resolution is
acceptable.    In some cases, although two different displays are used, the
images displayed thereon may be combined to form a single unified image.
B.      SPEAKER
[0157]         A hand-held device may also include a speaker. Speakers are
components that accept electronic signals representing audio information
from an amplifier and converts them into sound waves. The speakers may be
used to listen to music in conjunction with a music player functionality or to
listen to an incoming call in conjunction with a cell phone functionality. The
speaker may be placed on the top surface or possible on the front top bezel
of the hand-held device. This arrangement works particularly well when the
device is used as a cell phone.
C.      INDICATOR (LED)
                                        38

WO 2006/094308                                                    PCT/US2006/008349
 [0158]        A hand-held device may also include one or more indicators that
provide user feedback or indicate events associated with the device. The
events may relate to signals, conditions or status of the device. For example,
the indicators provide status of battery life or alert a user when there is an
incoming call.     The indicators, which include light sources such as light
emitting diodes (LED), are typically illuminated when an event occurs, and not
illuminated when the event is stopped. Furthermore, the indicator may turn
on and off (blink) or cycle with increasing or decreasing intensity, and in
some cases may even change colors in order to provide more detailed
information about the event that is being monitored.
 [0159]        The indicators may be conventional indicators that typically
 include a small clear plastic insert, which is located in front of the LED, and
which is inserted within an opening in the housing thus causing it to exist at
the surface of the housing. The LED itself may also be placed in the opening
in the housing rather than using an insert. Alternatively, the indicator can be
configured not to break the surface of the housing. In this configuration, the
light source is disposed entirely inside the housing, and is configured to
illuminate a portion of the housing thereby causing the housing to change its
appearance, i.e., change its color.
D.      AUDIO/TACTILE FEEDBACK DEVICES
[0160]         The hand-held device may include speakers or buzzers to give
audio feedback to the user.       These may work similarly to the indicators
described above, or they may be used to enhance the feel of actuating a GUI
element such as a soft button or scroll wheel. For example, the speaker may
be configured to output a "clicking" noise when a user presses on a virtual
button, or rotates a virtual scroll wheel. This particular feature enhances the
user experience and makes the virtual UI feel more like a physical UI.
[0161]         The hand-held device may also include a haptics mechanism.
Haptics is the science of applying tactile sensation and control to interaction
with computer applications.        Haptics essentially allows a user to feel
information, i.e., signals are sent to the hand. The haptics mechanisms may
                                         39

WO 2006/094308                                                   PCT/US2006/008349
be widely varied. They may include motors, vibrators, electromagnets, etc.,
all of which are capable of providing force feedback in the form of vibration or
shaking.    The haptics mechanisms may work similarly to the indicators
described above (alert), or they may be used to enhance the feel of actuating
a GUI element such as a soft button or scroll wheel. For example, the haptics
mechanism may be configured to vibrate when a user presses on a virtual
button, or rotates a virtual scroll wheel. This particular feature enhances the
users experience and makes the virtual UI feel more like a physical UI.
Haptics may also be used simultaneously with onscreen actions. For example,
during movies or game playing, the haptics mechanism can simulate the
action being displayed.     For example, the haptics mechanism may provide
force feedback in the form of vibration when a car explodes during a movie or
game.
 [0162]        In cases where haptics is used to enhance the feel of actuating
a GUI element, such as a soft button or scroll wheel, the haptics mechanism
 may be located in the region of the display and further underneath the display
 so as to provide force feedback directly underneath the user action. In fact,
 multiple haptics mechanisms may be used regionally across the display to
further enhance the feel. It is generally believed that the closer the vibration
 is to the user action, the greater the haptics effect. In one implementation,
the haptics mechanisms are spaced out in an array underneath the display.
That is, they are spatially separated and placed at different locations. By way
 of example, they may be positioned in a 2x2, 2x4, 4x4, 4x8, 8x8 array and so
 on underneath the display.
 [0163]        Audio and/or tactile feedback may be used to alert a user that a
 user input has been made.      For example, in response to touching a virtual
 button on the GUI, the haptics may provide force feedback in the form of
 vibration and the speaker may provide audio feedback in the form of a click.
The tactile audio feedback can be used in conjunction with an input event
 including touch events, motion events, squeeze events. The feedback may
 provide information so that the user knows that they actually implemented an
 input (simulates the audio and tactile feel of a button or switch).      In one
                                        40

WO 2006/094308                                                  PCT/US2006/008349
implementation, the feedback is tied to the level of force being applied to the
force sensing devices. For example, when a certain force threshold is
reached, the audio feedback device may create a "click" on the press and a
"clock" on the release. The force threshold used may be similar to the
threshold used to determine whether a touch is a light or hard touch. The
"click" and "clock" may be used to simulate a button click when a hard touch
is made.
VI.     COMMUNICATION DEVICES
A. WIRED
 [0164]        The hand-held device may also include one or more connectors
for receiving and transmitting data to and from the device. By way of
 example, the device may include one or more audio jacks, video jacks, data
 ports, docking ports, etc. The hand-held device may also include one or more
 connectors for receiving and transmitting power to and from the hand-held
 device.
 [0165]        The hand-held device may include a headphone/microphone
 jack and a data port. The jack is capable of receiving a speaker and/or
 microphone plug so that audio may be input to and output from the device.
 The data port is capable of receiving a data plug/cable assembly configured
 for transmitting and receiving data to and from a host device, such as a
 general purpose computer (e.g., desktop computer, portable computer). For
 example, the data port may be used to upload or download data to and from
 the hand-held device.     Such data may include songs and play lists, audio
 books, e-books, photos, address books, documents, appointments, etc. into
 the hand-held device. The data port may be a PS/2 port, serial port, parallel
  port, network interface port, USB port, Firewire port etc. The hand-held
 device may also include a power port that receives a power plug/cable
 assembly configured for delivering powering to the hand-held device.          In
 some cases, the data port may serve as both a data and power port by
 employing either standard or proprietary connectors.

B.       WIRELESS
[0166]          To send and receive data wirelessly, the device generally
requires a transmitter, a receiver (or a transceiver) and some sort of antenna.
The wireless communication link may correspond to Bluetooth, WiFi (802.11),
IR (infrared), etc. The antenna may be fully contained within the device or
they may extend outside the device. The antenna may take a variety of
forms depending on the frequency to be used, etc. For example be a rugged
 rubber duck that consists of a coiled up element encased in rubber.
 Alternatively, the antenna may be printed on a circuit board within the device.
 [0167]          The hand-held device may also include a radio transceiver for
 communications via a cellular network or a GPS receiver.
 C.       CHANGE UI BASED ON RECEIVED COMMUNICATION SIGNALS
  [0168]         A hand-held electronic device may be configured to actively look
 for signals in the surrounding environment, and change its mode based on
 the signal. That is, the device tries to match the mode with the signal. If the
  device receives a phone signal over the cellular network, the device may turn
  into a phone, i.e., the phone mode is activated or brought forward relative to
  the other modes. If a device receives an email, the device may turn into an
  email terminal. As another example, when a user walks into a home theater
  room, the device may sense signals from the media control unit and turn itself
  into a remote control including functionality to control the various devices of
  the home theater (TV, amp, DVD, lighting). In other cases, the device may
  sense signals, which are being broadcast in physical stores, and turn itself
   into a device that is well suited for that store. For example, in a bank, the
   device may change into a calculator or bring a money program into view, or
   in a grocery store, the device may turn into a money payment device or bring
   a grocery list into view.
   VII.    OTHER COMPONENTS OF HAND-HELD DEVICE
   [0169]         The hand held device may additionally include one or more of
   the following hardware components: a controller (e.g., microprocessor, DSP,
                                          42

WO 2006/094308                                                PCT/US2006/008349
A/D, D/A, converters, codes), memory (e.g., RAM, ROM, solid state (flash),
hard disk (micro-drive)), storage (SD card slots, mini-DVD), battery (e.g.,
lithium ion ), etc.
VIII.   OVERALL BLOCK DIAGRAM
[0170]         Fig. 28 is a block diagram of an exemplary hand-held device
600. The hand-held device 600 typically includes a controller 602 (e.g., CPU)
configured to execute instructions and to carry out operations associated with
the hand-held device. For example, using instructions retrieved for example
from memory, the controller 602 may control the reception and manipulation
of input and output data between components of the hand-held device 600.
The controller 602 can be implemented on a single chip, multiple chips or
 multiple electrical components.   For example, various architectures can be
 used for the controller 602, including dedicated or embedded processor,
 single purpose processor, controller, ASIC, etc.    By way of example, the
 controller may include microprocessors, DSP, A/D converters, D/A converters,
 compression, decompression, etc.
 [0171]        In most cases, the controller 602 together with an operating
 system operates to execute computer code and produce and use data. The
 operating system may correspond to well known operating systems such as
 OS/2, DOS, Unix, Linux, and Palm OS, or alternatively to special purpose
 operating system, such as those used for limited purpose appliance-type
 devices. The operating system, other computer code and data may reside
 within a memory block 604 that is operatively coupled to the controller 602.
 Memory block 604 generally provides a place to store computer code and
 data that are used by the hand-held device. By way of example, the memory
 block 604 may include read-only memory (ROM), random-access memory
 (RAM),   hard disk drive (e.g., a micro drive), flash memory, etc.          In
 conjunction with the memory block 604, the hand-held device may include a
 removable storage device such as an optical disc player that receives and
 plays DVDs, or card slots for receiving mediums such as memory cards (or
                                       43

WO 2006/094308                                                  PCT/US2006/008349
memory sticks). Because the form factor of the hand-held device is small, the
optical drive may only be configured for mini DVDs.
[0172]         The hand-held device 600 also includes various input devices
606 that are operatively coupled to the controller 602. The input devices 606
are configured to transfer data from the outside world into the hand-held
device 600. As shown, the input devices 606 may correspond to both data
entry mechanisms and data capture mechanisms.           In particular, the input
devices 606 may include touch sensing devices 608 such as touch screens,
touch pads and touch sensing surfaces, mechanical actuators 610 such as
 button or wheels or hold switches (611), motion sensing devices 612 such as
accelerometers, force sensing devices 614 such as force sensitive displays and
 housings, image sensors 616, and microphones 618. The input devices 606
 may also include a clickable display actuator 619.
 [0173]        The hand-held device 600 also includes various output devices
 620 that are operatively coupled to the controller 602. The output devices
 620 are configured to transfer data from the hand-held device 600 to the
 outside world. The output devices 620 may include a display 622 such as an
 LCD, speakers or jacks 624, audio/tactile feedback devices 626, light
 indicators 628, and the like
 [0174]        The hand-held device 600 also includes various communication
 devices 630 that are operatively coupled to the controller 602.             The
communication devices 630 may, for example, include both wired and
wireless connectivity selected from I/O ports 632 such as IR, USB, or Firewire
 ports, GPS receiver 634, and a radio receiver 636.
 [0175]        The hand-held device 600 also includes a battery 650 and
 possibly a charging system 652.      The battery may be charged through a
transformer and power cord or through a host device or through a docking
station. In the cases of the docking station, the charging may be transmitted
through electrical ports or possibly through an inductance charging means
that does not require a physical electrical connection to be made.
 [0176]        The various aspects, features, embodiments or implementations
of the invention described above can be used alone or in various
                                        44

combinations.     The methods of this invention can be implemented by
software, hardware or a combination of hardware and software.              The
invention can also be embodied as computer readable code on a computer
readable medium. The computer readable medium is any data storage device
that can store data which can thereafter be read by a computer system,
including both transfer and non-transfer devices as defined above. Examples
of the computer readable medium include read-only memory, random access
memory, CD-ROMs, flash memory cards, DVDs, magnetic tape, optical data
storage devices, and carrier waves. The computer readable medium can also
be distributed over network-coupled computer systems so that the computer
readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion.
 [0177]        While this invention has been described in terms of several
 preferred embodiments, there are alterations, permutations, and equivalents,
which fall within the scope of this invention.   It should also be noted that
there are many alternative ways of implementing the methods and
apparatuses of the present invention.      It is therefore intended that the
following appended claims be interpreted as including all such alterations,
 permutations, and equivalents as fall within the true spirit and scope of the
 present invention.
