                                    FORMULATIONS, AND METHODS
            The present application is a divisional application from Australian patent application number
 5 <removed-apn>, which in turn is a divisional application from Australian patent application number
   2015202390, which in turn is a divisional application from Australian patent application number
   2011292146, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
                                                  Background
            There has been an effort in recent years, with significant success, to discover new drug
10 compounds that act by stimulating certain key aspects of the immune system, as well as by suppressing
   certain other aspects (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,039,969 (Tomai et al.) and 6,200,592 (Tomai et al.).
   These compounds, referred to herein as immune response modifiers (IRMs), appear to act through
   basic immune system mechanisms known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to induce selected cytokine
   biosynthesis, induction of co-stimulatory molecules, and increased antigen-presenting capacity.
15          Many IRMs may be useful for treating a wide variety of diseases and conditions. For example,
   certain IRMs may be useful for treating viral diseases (e.g., human papilloma virus, hepatitis, herpes),
   neoplasias (e.g., basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis, melanoma), TH2
   mediated diseases (e.g., asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis), and auto-immune diseases. Certain
   IRMs may also be useful, for example, as vaccine adjuvants.
20          Many known IRMs are imidazoquinoline amine derivatives (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,338
   (Gerster)), but other compound classes are known as well (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,446,153
   (Lindstrom et al.); 6,194,425 (Gerster et al.); and 6,110,929 (Gerster et al.); and International
   Publication Number W02005/079195 (Hays et al.).
            In view of the great therapeutic potential for IRMs in the treatment of a wide variety of
25 diseases and conditions, and despite the important work that has already been done, new compounds
   that can effectively modulate the immune response, by induction of cytokine biosynthesis or other
   mechanisms, are still needed.

                                                   Summary
  The present invention provides, in one aspect, a new compound useful for inducing cytokine
  biosynthesis.      The    compound        (i.e.,     N-(4- { [4-amino-2-butyl- lH-imidazo [4,5-c]quinolin
  lyl]oxy}butyl)octadecanamide) has the following formula (I):

                                                            I.
             Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound may also be used.
             The compound of Formula I has unexpectedly beneficial properties in terms of biologic activity.
 5 It is particularly desirable for incorporation into liposome based formulations. It appears that such
   formulations are surprisingly effective at boosting localized immune response with reduced systemic TNF
   induction.
             The ability to induce cytokine biosynthesis in animals makes the compound of Formula I useful
   for treating a variety of conditions such as viral diseases and tumors that are responsive to such changes
10 in the immune response. Accordingly, the present invention further provides methods of inducing
   cytokine biosynthesis in an animal, treating a viral infection and/or treating a neoplastic disease in an
   animal by administering an effective amount of a compound of Formula I to the animal. The present
   invention further provides a method of vaccinating an animal comprising administering an effective
   amount of a compound of Formula I to the animal as a vaccine adjuvant.
15           The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically
   acceptable carrier and a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I. In some
   embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises an antigen (e.g., a vaccine). In some
   embodiments of the pharmaceutical composition, the compound of Formula I is incorporated in a
   homogeneously dispersed formulation. In some embodiments of the pharmaceutical composition, the
20 compound of Formula I is incorporated in an emulsified formulation. In some embodiments of the
   pharmaceutical composition, the compound of Formula I is incorporated in an oil-in-water formulation
   (for example formulations comprising soybean oil, TWEEN 80, SPAN 85, and PBS). In some
   embodiments of the pharmaceutical composition, the compound of Formula I is incorporated into a
   liposome-based formulation.
25           Used as a vaccine adjuvant to an antigen vaccine, the compound of Formula I increases the
   antibody response to the vaccine. It can decrease the amount of antigen vaccine required to achieve a
   desired\therapeutically effective antibody response. For example, it can reduce the amount of vaccine
   antigen needed by 2-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 25-fold, 50-fold, or as much as 100-fold or more.
                                                           -2-

       WO 2012/024284                                                                   PCT/US2011/047901
            As illustrated in part by the non-limiting examples set forth herein, the compound of Formula I is
   useful for a wide range purposes, including but not limited to such things as a vaccine adjuvant for
   influenza vaccines. For example, when used as a vaccine adjuvant, the compound of Formula I in
   combination with an influenza vaccine antigen provides protection for H IN 1 influenza infection (as well
 5 as influenza A, B, and swine flu). In particular, when used as a vaccine adjuvant, the compound of
   Formula I in combination with hemagglutinin antigens provides protection for H IN 1 influenza infection.
            The compound of Formula I induces cytokine production primarily at the site of administration
   (or at a local site of application) and can do so without substantial systemic cytokine induction, which
   may be important for reducing side effects. For example, the compound of Formula I can induce TNF
10 production primarily at the site of administration (or at a local site of application) without inducing
   systemic TNF levels above the background level (i.e. the level measured systemically prior to
   administration of the compound of Formula I). In some applications subcutaneous injection of the
   compound of Formula I can be used to induce cytokine production (such as TNF production) in the local
   draining lymph nodes, but not peripheral lymph nodes. For example, subcutaneous injection of the
15 compound of Formula I can induce cytokine production (such as TNF production) in the local draining
   lymph nodes at levels at least 2 times, 3 times, 5 times, 10 times, or as much as 100 times greater or more
   than in the peripheral lymph nodes
            In addition to the compound of Formula I, it is believed that the compound N-(4- { [4-amino-2
   butyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl]oxy}butyl)hexadecanamide may be synthesized using a similar
20 synthetic route and may also be used for the same uses, pharmaceutical compositions, and formulations as
   the compound of Formula one set forth herein.
            The terms "comprises" and variations thereof do not have a limiting meaning where these terms
   appear in the description and claims.
25          As used herein, "a", "an", "the", "at least one", and "one or more" are used interchangeably.
            Also herein, the recitations of numerical ranges by endpoints include all numbers subsumed
   within that range (e.g., I to 5 includes 1, 1.5, 2, 2.75, 3, 3.80, 4, 5, etc.).
             "Ameliorate" refers to any reduction in the extent, severity, frequency, and/or likelihood of a
   symptom or clinical sign characteristic of a particular condition.
30           "Antigen" refers to any substance that may be bound by an antibody in a manner that is
   immunospecific to some degree.
             "Induce" and variations thereof refer to any measurable increase in cellular activity. For example,
   induction of an immune response may include, for example, an increase in the production of a cytokine,
   activation, proliferation, or maturation of a population of immune cells, and/or other indicator of
35 increased immune function.

            A solution of valeric anhydride (6.03 g) and pyridine hydrochloride (0.198 g) in pyridine (8.28 g)
   was added to a solution of 3-amino-4-chloroquinoline (2.94 g) in pyridine (5.0 g) and the reaction was
   stirred at room temperature for 16 hours followed by heating at 60 0C for 3 hours. The reaction was
   concentrated under reduced pressure and sodium carbonate (15 mL of a 10% aqueous solution) was
 5 added. The reaction was stirred for 30 minutes and then filtered. The resulting solid was washed with
   water (60 mL) and dried under vacuum for 4 hours to provide 4.59 g of crude N-(4-chloroquinolin-3
   yl)valeramide as brown flakes. The crude product was recrystallized from heptane (10 mL) and the
   recovered product was further purified by soxhlet extraction using refluxing heptane for 16 hours. The
   collection flask from the soxhlet extraction apparatus was cooled in a freezer for 2 hours. The resulting
10 solid was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to yield 2.00 g of N-(4-chloroquinolin-3
   yl)valeramide as a white solid.
   Part B
            A solution of 4-amino-1-butanol (7.68 g) and pyridine (7.00 g) in dichloromethane (100 mL) was
15 chilled in an ice bath and a solution of benzylchloroformate (14.37 g) in dichloromethane (100 mL) was
   slowly added with stirring over a period of thirty minutes. The ice bath was removed and the reaction
   was stirred for an additional 16 hours. Hydrochloric acid (1.2 M, 200 mL) was added and phases were
   separated. The organic phase was dried (MgSO 4 ), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The
   resulting residue was recrystallized from toluene and dried under vacuum to provide 5.15 g of benzyl (4
20 hydroxybutyl)carbamate.
            A solution of N-hydroxyphthalimide (3.36 g), benzyl (4-hydroxybutyl)carbamate (4.18 g) and
   triphenylphosphine (7.41 g) in dichloromethane (100 mL) was chilled in an ice bath and approximately
   two-thirds of a solution of diisopropylazodicarboxylate (DIAD, 5.68 g) in dichloromethane (50 mL) was
   slowly added with stirring. The internal temperature of the reaction was monitored and the addition of
25 the DIAD solution was stopped when an exotherm could no longer be detected. The ice bath was
   removed and the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature. The reaction was concentrated
   under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was dissolved in ethanol (200 proof, 100 mL).
   Hydrazine (1.98 g, 35% in water) was added and the reaction was stirred for 6 hours. The reaction was
   cooled in the freezer and the resulting solid was removed by filtration. The solid was washed with
30 ethanol (50 mL). The combined filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and diethyl ether (100
   mL) was added. Insoluble impurities were removed by filtration and 2.0 M HCl in ether (10 mL) was
   added to the solution. A precipitate formed immediately. The crude product was added to toluene (100
   mL) and heated at reflux temperatue for one hour. After cooling to room temperature, the solid product
   was recovered by filtration, washed with toluene, and dried under vacuum to yield 3.76 g of benzyl (4
35 aminooxybutyl)carbamate.

   Part C
            N-(4-chloroquinolin-3-yl)valeramide (1.97 g), benzyl (4-aminooxybutyl)carbamate (2.99 g),
   triethylamine (0.89 g) and 2-propanol (40.69 g) were combined and heated at 80 0C for 3.5 hours. The
   reaction was cooled to room temperature, filtered, and the filtrate concentrated under reduced pressure.
 5 Dichloromethane (20 mL) was added to the resulting solid and the mixture was stirred for twenty
   minutes. Undissolved solid was removed by filtration and the filtrate was washed with two 10 mL
   portions of water that had been made slightly acidic by the addition of 20 drops of hydrochloric acid (1.2
   M). The organic fraction was dried and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude solid was
   recrystallized from tetrahydrofuran to provide 2.56 g of benzyl 4-{[2-butyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin
10  1-yl]oxy}butylcarbamate.
   Part D
            Benzyl 4-{[2-butyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl]oxy}butylcarbamate hydrochloride (10.05 g)
   was dissolved in dichloromethane (80 mL) and extracted with a solution of sodium carbonate (2.02 g) in
15 30 ml H20. The organic layer was cooled in an ice bath and a solution of m-chloroperbenzoic acid (5.93
   g, 1.24 eq) dissolved in dichloromethane (30 mL) was slowly added. After 6 hr, ammonium hydroxide
   (10 mL of a 28-30% aqueous solution) was added to the reaction. A solution of benzenesulfonyl chloride
   (6.96 g) dissolved in 10 ml dichloromethane was slowly added with vigorous stirring. The cooling bath
   was removed and the reaction was stirred for an additional 12 hours. The reaction was diluted with water
20 (100 mL) and the organic and aqueous fractions were separated. The aqueous fraction was extracted
   with dichloromethane (30 mL). The combined organic fractions were washed with two 90 ml portions of
   5% sodium carbonate.
            The dichloromethane solution was transferred to a distillation apparatus and 1 -pentanol (50 mL)
   was added. This was warmed to 400 C and the dichoromethane was removed under reduced pressure.
25 Concentrated hydrochloric acid (50 ml) was then added and the reaction was stirred and heated to 80'.
   After 11 hoursr, the solution was cooled to room temperature and diluted with water (100 mL). The
   aqueous fraction was separated from the 1-pentanol and the 1 -pentanol was extracted with water (25 mL).
   The aqueous fractions were combined. 1-Pentanol (50 mL) was added to the combined aqueous fraction
   and this was cooled in an ice-bath. With vigorous stirring, solid sodium carbonate was added to bring the
30 pH to 9-10. The mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel and the fractions were separated. The
   aqueous fraction was extracted with two 25 ml portions of 1-pentanol. The combined 1-pentanol
   fractions were dried over sodium sulfate and filtered to provide 1-(4-aminobutoxy)-2-butyl- 1H
   imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine dissolved in 1-pentanol.
   The maleate salt of 1-(4-aminobutoxy)-2-butyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine was prepared by
35 dissolving maleic acid (4.83 g) in 1-pentanol (50 mL) and adding it with stirring to the solution of 1-(4
   aminobutoxy)-2-butyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine in 1-pentanol. The resulting precipitate was
                                                       -6-

   Broad peaks for the ammonium protons are seen at approximately 6 7.8 and 6 8.7.
 5           As an alternative the fumarate salt of 1-(4-aminobutoxy)-2-butyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4
   amine was prepared by the following procedure. 1-(4-aminobutoxy)-2-butyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin
   4-amine (6.53 g) was dissolved in 2-propanol (75 mL) and decolorizing carbon was added. The reaction
   was heated to reflux, filtered while hot, and cooled to room temperature. A solution of fumaric acid (2.5
   g) in 2-propanol was added and the reaction was heated at reflux temperature for 5 minutes. Upon
10 cooling to room temperature a precipitate formed. Filtration followed by drying the product under
   vacuum yielded 6.6 g of 1-(4-aminobutoxy)-2-butyl- 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine fumarate.

   Part E
             1-(4-Aminobutoxy)-2-butyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine fumarate (1.30 g) was dissolved
   in dichloromethane (25 mL) and the solution washed with 3x 15 ml portions of saturated sodium
   carbonate. The organic fraction was then washed with 15 ml saturated sodium chloride and dried over
20 MgSO 4 . The solution was filtered, the solvent removed under reduced pressure and the product was
   dried under vacuum to give 0.79 g of 1-(4-aminobutoxy)-2-butyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine as
   the free base.
             The 1-(4-aminobutoxy)-2-butyl- 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine was dissolved in
   dichloromethane (20 mL) and methanol (5 mL). Stearic acid (0.71 g) was added and the reaction was
25 stirred to dissolve the stearic acid. 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide HCl (EDC, 0.45 g)
   was added and the reaction was stirred at ambient temperature for 16 hours. An additional portion of
   EDC was added (0.23 g) and the reaction was stirred for an additional 24 hours. Final portions of stearic
   acid (0.22 g) and EDC (0.37 g) were added to drive the reaction to completion and the reaction was
   stirred at ambient temperature for another 24 hours. The reaction was concentrated under reduced
30 pressure and the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography using a Biotage
   chromatography system (Si40+ M2358-1 SiGel column, 85:15 dichloromethane/methanol isocratic
   elution). The semi-pure product was purified by flash column chromatography two more times using a
   90:10 dichloromethane/methanol isocratic elution, followed by a 95:5 dichloromethane/methanol isocratic
   elution The fractions containing product were concentrated to yield 1.12 g of N-(4-{[4-amino-2-butyl-1H
35 imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl]oxy}butyl)octadecanamide as an off white waxy solid.

            The vaccine adjuvant activity of N-(4- { [4-amino-2-butyl- 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin- 1
   yl]oxy}butyl)octadecanamide (Cmpd of Example 1) was evaluated in mice immunized with recombinant
   hemagglutinin 1 (HA). IgG2a antigen specific antibody response was measured using five different
   preparations (1. HA alone (control); 2. HA + resiquimod (comparator preparation); 3. HA + Cmpd of
10 Example 1 formulated in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) (liposome formulation); 3. HA + Cmpd of
   Example 1; 5. HA + DOPC (control).
            The Cmpd of Example 1 and resiquimod were individually prepared as aqueous suspensions in
   phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The Cmpd of Example 1 formulated in DOPC liposome formulation
   was prepared as follows. A stock solution of the Cmpd of Example 1 was prepared in chloroform at a
15 concentration of 10 mg/ml. A stock solution of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) was also prepared
   in chloroform at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Aliquots of each stock solution were combined to provide
   a solution containing DOPC and the Cmpd of Example 1 at a mass ratio of 10:1, respectively. The
   solution was blown to dryness and resuspended in sterile PBS by probe sonication.
             Groups of 5 mice each were immunized subcutaneously with 10 ig of HA antigen in PBS, alone
20 or in combination with 1 mg/Kg of the compounds cited in Table 1. DOPC control animals received the
   same amount of DOPC as that prepared with the Cmpd of Example 1. The mice were boosted with the
   same combinations 2 weeks and 4 weeks following the initial immunization.                   At 7 weeks post
   immunization, the mice were bled and the HA-specific IgG2a titers were determined. This determination
   was performed by serial dilution of the serum samples by standard serum ELISA in HA-coated microtiter
25 plates. IgG2a data is presented as the serum dilution achieving the end point (2X baseline) and is the
   geometric mean for the 5 mice per group.

   cultures established from the same animals for which IgG2a antibody responses were determined in
   Example 2. The spleens from the animals were removed, combined to form two pools for each group of 5
 5 animals, minced to create single cell suspensions, and placed in culture in 96 well microtiter plates. Each
   pool generated three wells for a control PBS challenge and three wells for a 10 mg HA challenge. The
   cultures were then incubated at 37 0C for 72 hours. The medium was then removed and the interferon
   gamma generated was measured (pg/ml) by an ELISA assay (Table 2). The IFNgamma data is reported as
   the geometric mean value for each pool using triplicate measurements.

   (Cmpd of Example 1) to induce the formation of systemic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in vivo was
   evaluated in mice. Systemic TNF induction was measured using four different preparations (1. PBS
 5 (control); 2. resiquimod (comparator preparation); 3. resiquimod formulated in
   dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) (comparator preparation); 4. Cmpd of Example 1 formulated in
   dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) (liposomes).
             Compound of Example 1 formulated in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) liposomes was
   prepared as described in Example 2. Resiquimod formulated in DOPC was prepared in an analogous
10 manner to the Cmpd of Example 1 in DOPC. The resiquimod preparation was made as an aqueous
   suspension in PBS.
             Mice were injected subcutaneously with preparations containing 1 mg/Kg of each test compound
   (i.e. resiquimod or Cmpd of Example 1). At one hour and at three hours post dose, the mice were bled and
   systemic TNF was measured in the serum (pg/mL) by ELISA assay. The results are presented as the
15 geometric means obtained for each group of five animals. The data in Table 3 shows that subcutaneous
   injection of resiquimod in various formulations induces a systemic TNF response, while N-(4- { [4-amino
   2-butyl- 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin- 1-yl]oxy}butyl)octadecanamide (Cmpd of Example 1) does not
   induce a systemic TNF response. This can be important in providing localized immune system
   enhancement without systemic TNF side effects.

   immunization model. Groups of C57/B1 male mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were immunized
   and boosted twice at two week intervals with 1) PBS; 2) 20 ptg ovalbumin; or 3) 20 ptg ovalbumin + 1.0
10 mg/Kg Cmpd of Example 1. One week following the final boost, each mouse was injected intradermally
   with 4E5 B16Ova melanoma tumor cells.                       Mice were sacrificed 11 days following tumor injection,
   tumors were measured at their major and minor diameters, and the products of the two measurements
   were determined.             The mean tumor size in mm2             +/-     standard deviation (s.d.) for each group was
   determined. The results are presented in Table 8.

   (Charles River) and compared to the activity of resiquimod (a comparator compound). Solutions of the
15 Cmpd of Example 1 or resiquimod were injected subcutaneously into four separate groups of mice for
   evaluation at the time points of 1 hour, 3 hour, 6 hours, and 18 hours post dose. The final dose for either
   compound was 1.0 mg/kg. At each time point, the mice were bled, sacrificed, and the draining axial and
   brachial lymph nodes were removed and placed in RNA preservation fluid (RNAlater reagent obtained
   from Ambion Corporation, Austin, TX). Serum samples were analyzed for TNF protein concentration
20 (pg/ml) by ELISA as a measure of systemic presence of this cytokine. The draining lymph nodes were
   processed for measurement of TNF mRNA gene expression by quantitative PCR (7900HT Thermocycler
   obtained from Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).            The data reported (Table 10) is the mean +/
   standard deviation (s.d.) for each group. The "not detected" level for serum TNF concentration was less
   than 10 pg/ml. The induction of TNF mRNA gene expression in the draining lymph nodes without
25 detection of TNF protein in the serum after the injection of the Cmpd of Example 1 demonstrates that the
   cytokine induction effects of the Cmpd of Example 1 are primarily local.

            The present invention thus provides the compound of Formula I, as well as pharmaceutical
   compositions and formulations thereof. In some embodiments, the compound of Formula I is
 5 incorporated into a liposome based formulation. One may also incorporate an antigen admixed with or
   administered separately but in combination with such formulation. For example, an antigen may be
   formulated within the lumen of the self - assembling liposome particle. Such liposomes would include
   composites of such substances in proportions best suited to yield stable particles of desired sizes and
   diameters. Sizes can be of the sub micron range to mimic viral pathogens and micron size to mimic
10 bacterial antigens. These sizes can be controlled by particle composition and process of formation.
            In some embodiments of the methods disclosed herein, the compound of Formula I (e.g., in a
   pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein) is administered to a localized tissue region, such as into a
   tumor mass. In some of these embodiments, the compound of Formula I is administered to localized
   tissue, such as a tumor mass, in a liposome formulation. A cancer vaccine may also be included.
15          A "localized tissue region" will generally be a relatively small portion of the body, e.g., less than
    10 percent by volume, and often less than 1 percent by volume. For example, depending on the size of,
   e.g., a solid tumor or cancerous organ, the localized tissue region will typically be on the order of no more
   than about 500 cubic centimeters (cm 3 ), often less than about 100 cm 3 , and in many instances 10 cm 3 or
   less. For some applications the localized tissue region will be 1 cm 3 or less (e.g., for small tumor nodules,
20 viral lesions, or vaccination sites). However, in certain instances the localized tissue region may be a
   particularly large region, up to several liters, for example, to treat metastasized cancer within the entire
   peritoneal cavity. The localized tissue region may be, for example, a cancer, a viral infected lesion, or
   organ, or vaccination site. It may be, for example, a solid tumor, lymph tissue, reticuloendothelial
   system, bone marrow, mucosal tissue, etc. The localized tissue region may be, e.g., a breast cancer tumor,
25 stomach cancer tumor, lung cancer tumor, head or neck cancer tumor, colorectal cancer tumor, renal cell
   carcinoma tumor, pancreatic cancer tumor, basal cell carcinoma tumor, cervical cancer tumor, melanoma
   cancer tumor, prostate cancer tumor, ovarian cancer tumor, or bladder cancer tumor. Delivery of the

             In some embodiments of the pharmaceutical compositions and methods disclosed herein, the
   pharmaceutical composition further comprises an antigen in an amount effective to generate an immune
 5 response against the antigen. In some embodiments, the antigen is a vaccine. Vaccines include any
   material administered to raise either humoral and/or cell mediated immune response, such as live or
   attenuated viral and bacterial immunogens and inactivated viral, tumor-derived, protozoal, organism
   derived, fungal, and bacterial immunogens, toxoids, toxins, polysaccharides, proteins, glycoproteins,
   peptides, cellular vaccines (e.g., using dendritic cells), DNA vaccines, recombinant proteins,
10 glycoproteins, and peptides. Exemplary vaccines include vaccines for cancer, BCG, cholera, plague,
   typhoid, hepatitis A, B, and C, influenza A and B, parainfluenza, polio, rabies, measles, mumps, rubella,
   yellow fever, tetanus, diphtheria, hemophilus influenza b, tuberculosis, meningococcal and pneumococcal
   vaccines, adenovirus, HIV, chicken pox, cytomegalovirus, dengue, feline leukemia, fowl plague, HSV- 1
   and HSV-2, hog cholera, Japanese encephalitis, respiratory syncytial virus, rotavirus, papilloma virus,
15 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), anthrax, and yellow fever. See also, e.g., vaccines disclosed
   in International Publication No. WO 02/24225 (Thomsen et al.).
             Antigens can be co-delivered with a compound of Formula I, for example, in admixture in a
   pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention. Such pharmaceutical compositions may
   include the compound in Formula I in liposomes. This may allow the compound of Formula I to reach,
20 for example, antigen presenting cells at or around the same time as the antigen. In other embodiments,
   the compound of Formula I and the antigen may be administered separately at or about the same time.
   Co-delivering a vaccine adjuvant (e.g., an IRM compound such as a compound of Formula I) and an
   antigen to an immune cell can increase the immune response to the antigen and improve antigen-specific
   immunological memory. Optimal delivery may occur, for example, when the adjuvant and the antigen
25 are processed within an antigen presenting cell at the same time.
             In addition to the delivery methods mentioned specifically above, a compound of Formula I (e.g.,
   in a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein) may be administered in any other suitable manner
   (e.g., non-parenterally or parenterally). As used herein, non-parenterally refers to administration through
   the digestive tract, including by oral ingestion. Parenterally refers to administration other than through
30 the digestive tract which would include nasal (e.g., transmucosally by inhalation), topical, ophthalmic,
   and buccal adminstration, but in practice usually refers to injection (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular,
   subcutaneous, intratumoral, or transdermal) using, for example, conventional needle injection, injection
   using a microneedle array, or any other known method of injection.
             The compound of Formula I may be provided in any pharmaceutical composition suitable for
35 administration to a subject and may be present in the pharmaceutical composition in any suitable form
   (e.g., a solution, a suspension, an emulsion, or any form of mixture). The pharmaceutical composition

   may be formulated with any pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, or vehicle. In some
   embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier comprises water (e.g., phosphate or citrate buffered
   saline). In some embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier comprises an oil (e.g., corn,
   sesame, squalene, cottonseed, soybean, or safflower oil). The pharmaceutical composition may further
 5 include one or more additives including skin penetration enhancers, colorants, fragrances, flavorings,
   moisturizers, thickeners, suspending agents, surfactants, and dispersing agents.
            In addition to antigens specifically described above, the pharmaceutical compositions and
   methods of the present disclosure can include other additional active agents, e.g., in admixture or
   administered separately. Such additional agents can include a chemotherapeutic agent, a cytotoxoid
10 agent, an antibody, an antiviral agent, a cytokine, a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) agonist, or an
   additional immune response modifier. TNFR agonists that may be delivered in conjunction with the
   compound of Formula I include CD40 receptor agonists, such as disclosed in copending application U.S.
   Patent Publication 2004/0141950 (Noelle et al.). Other active ingredients for use in combination with an
   IRM preparation of the present invention include those disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No.
15 2003/0139364 (Krieg et al.).
            In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention may be a
   conventional topical dosage formulation (e.g., a cream, an ointment, an aerosol formulation, a non-aerosol
   spray, a gel, or a lotion). Suitable types of formulations are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No.

   2003/0199538 (Skwierczynski et al.).
            The compound of Formula I has been shown to induce the production of TNF-a as described
   above. The ability to induce TNF production indicates that the compound of Formula I is useful as an
   immune response modifier that can modulate the immune response in a number of different ways,
25 rendering it useful in the treatment of a variety of disorders. Other cytokines whose production may be
   induced by the administration of the compound of Formula I generally include Type I interferons (e.g.,
   INF-a), IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, MIP-1, MCP-1, and a variety of other cytokines. Among other
   effects, these and other cytokines inhibit virus production and tumor cell growth, making the compound
   of Formula I useful in the treatment of viral diseases and neoplastic diseases. Accordingly, the invention
30 provides a method of inducing cytokine biosynthesis in an animal comprising administering an effective
   amount of the compound of Formula I (e.g., in a pharmaceutical composition) to the animal. The animal
   to which the compound of Formula I is administered for induction of cytokine biosynthesis may have a
   disease (e.g., a viral or neoplastic disease), and administration of the compound may provide therapeutic
   treatment. Also, the compound of Formula I may be administered to the animal before the animal
35 acquires the disease so that administration of the compound of Formula I may provide a prophylactic
   treatment.

            In addition to the ability to induce the production of cytokines, the compound of Formula I may
   affect other aspects of the innate immune response. For example, natural killer cell activity may be
   stimulated, an effect that may be due to cytokine induction. IRM activity of the compound of Formula I
   also may include activating macrophages, which in turn stimulate secretion of nitric oxide and the
 5 production of additional cytokines. IRM activity of the compound of Formula I also may include
   inducing cytokine production by T cells, activating T cells specific to an antigen, and/or activating
   dendritic cells. Further, IRM activity of the compound of Formula I may include proliferation and
   differentiation of B-lymphocytes. IRM activity of the compound of Formula I also may affect the
   acquired immune response. For example, IRM activity can include inducing the production of the T
10 helper type 1 (THI) cytokine IFN-y and/or inhibiting the production of the T helper type 2 (TH2)
   cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and/or IL-13.
            Exemplary conditions that may be treated by administering the compound of Formula I include:
            (a) viral diseases such as diseases resulting from infection by an adenovirus, a herpesvirus (e.g.,
   HSV-I, HSV-II, CMV, or VZV), a poxvirus (e.g., an orthopoxvirus such as variola or vaccinia, or
15 molluscum contagiosum), a picornavirus (e.g., rhinovirus or enterovirus), an orthomyxovirus (e.g.,
   influenzavirus), a paramyxovirus (e.g., parainfluenzavirus, mumps virus, measles virus, and respiratory
   syncytial virus (RSV)), a coronavirus (e.g., SARS), a papovavirus (e.g., papillomaviruses, such as those
   that cause genital warts, common warts, or plantar warts), a hepadnavirus (e.g., hepatitis B virus), a
   flavivirus (e.g., hepatitis C virus or Dengue virus), or a retrovirus (e.g., a lentivirus such as HIV);
20          (b) bacterial diseases such as diseases resulting from infection by bacteria of, for example, the
   genus Escherichia, Enterobacter, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Shigella, Listeria, Aerobacter,
   Helicobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Pneumococcus,
   Neisseria, Clostridium, Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium, Campylobacter, Vibrio, Serratia,
   Providencia, Chromobacterium, Brucella, Yersinia, Haemophilus, or Bordetella;
25          (c) other infectious diseases such as chlamydia, fungal diseases (e.g., candidiasis, aspergillosis,
   histoplasmosis, or cryptococcal meningitis), or parasitic diseases (e.g., malaria, pneumocystis carnii
   pneumonia, leishmaniasis, cryptosporidiosis, toxoplasmosis, and trypanosome infection);
            (d) neoplastic diseases such as intraepithelial neoplasias, cervical dysplasia, actinic keratosis,
   basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, melanoma,
30 leukemias (e.g., myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, non
   Hodgkin's lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma, and hairy cell leukemia), breast
   cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, and other cancers;
            (e) TH2-mediated, atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis or eczema, eosinophilia, asthma,
   allergy, allergic rhinitis, and Ommen's syndrome;

   thrombocythaemia, multiple sclerosis, discoid lupus, and alopecia areata; and

             (g) diseases associated with wound repair such as inhibition of keloid formation and other types
   of scarring (e.g., enhancing wound healing, including chronic wounds).
             The mechanism for the antiviral and antitumor activity of the compound of Formula I may be due
   in substantial part to enhancement of the immune response by induction of various important cytokines
 5 (e.g., at least one of tumor necrosis factor, interferons, or interleukins). Such compounds have been
   shown to stimulate a rapid release of certain monocyte/macrophage-derived cytokines and are also
   capable of stimulating B cells to secrete antibodies which play an important role in these IRM
   compounds' antiviral and antitumor activities.
             It will be understood that in the treatment of the diseases mentioned above, for example, the
10 compound of Formula I can be used in combination with other therapies such as the active agents
   mentioned above and other procedures (e.g., chemoablation, laser ablation, cryotherapy, and surgical
   excision).
             An amount of a compound effective to induce cytokine biosynthesis is an amount sufficient to
   cause one or more cell types, such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and B-cells to produce an
15 amount of one or more cytokines such as, for example, IFN-a, TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, IL-1O and IL-12 that is
   increased over a background level of such cytokines. The precise amount will vary according to factors
   known in the art but is expected to be a dose of about 100 nanograms per kilograms (ng/kg) to about 50
   milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), in some embodiments about 10 micrograms per kilogram (pg/kg) to
   about 5 mg/kg. The invention also provides a method of treating a viral infection in an animal and a
20 method of treating a neoplastic disease in an animal comprising administering an effective amount of a
   compound or pharmaceutical composition of the invention to the animal. An amount effective to treat or
   inhibit a viral infection is an amount that will cause a reduction in one or more of the manifestations of
   viral infection, such as viral lesions, viral load, rate of virus production, and mortality as compared to
   untreated control animals. The precise amount that is effective for such treatment will vary according to
25 factors known in the art but is expected to be a dose of about 100 ng/kg to about 50 mg/kg, in some
   embodiments about 10 pg/kg to about 5 mg/kg. An amount of a compound or pharmaceutical
   composition effective to treat a neoplastic condition is an amount that will cause a reduction in tumor size
   or in the number of tumor foci. Again, the precise amount will vary according to factors known in the art
   but is expected to be a dose of about 100 ng/kg to about 50 mg/kg, in some embodiments about 10 pg/kg
30 to about 5 mg/kg. The methods of the present invention may be performed on any suitable subject.
   Suitable subjects include animals such as humans, non-human primates, rodents, dogs, cats, horses, pigs,
   sheep, goats, or cows.
             The composition of a formulation suitable for practicing the invention, the precise amount of a
   compound of Formula I effective for methods according to the present invention, and the dosing regimen,
35 for example, will vary according to factors known in the art including the nature of the carrier, the state of
   the subject's immune system (e.g., suppressed, compromised, stimulated), the method of administering

        WO 2012/024284                                                                 PCT/US2011/047901
   the compound of Formula I, and the species to which the formulation is being administered. Accordingly,
   it is not practical to set forth generally the composition of a formulation that includes a compound of
   Formula I, an amount of a compound of Formula I that constitutes an effective amount, or a dosing
   regimen that is effective for all possible applications. Those of ordinary skill in the art, however, can
 5 readily determine appropriate formulations, amounts of the compound of Formula I, and dosing regimen
   with due consideration of such factors.
              In some embodiments, the methods of the present invention include administering a compound of
   Formula I to a subject in a formulation, for example, having a concentration of the compound from about
   0.0001% to about 20% (unless otherwise indicated, all percentages provided herein are weight/weight
10 with respect to the total formulation), although in some embodiments the compound of Formula I may be
   administered using a formulation that provides the compound in a concentration outside of this range. In
   some embodiments, the method includes administering to a subject a formulation that includes from about
   0.01% to about 1% of the compound of Formula I, for example, a formulation that includes about 0.1 %
   to about 0.5% compound of Formula I.
15            In some embodiments, the methods of the present invention include administering sufficient
   compound to provide a dose of, for example, from about 100 ng/kg to about 50 mg/kg to the subject,
   although in some embodiments the methods may be performed by administering compound in a dose
   outside this range. In some of these embodiments, the method includes administering sufficient
   compound to provide a dose of from about 10 pg/kg to about 5 mg/kg to the subject, for example, a dose
20 of from about 100 gg/kg to about 1 mg/kg. In some embodiments, the methods of the present invention
   may include administering sufficient compound to provide a dose of, for example, from about 0.01 mg/m 2
   to about 10 mg/m 2 . Alternatively, the dose may be calculated using actual body weight obtained just
   prior to the beginning of a treatment course. For the dosages calculated in this way, body surface area
                                                                                                   2         425
   (M2 )  is calculated prior to the beginning of the treatment course using the Dubois method: m = (wt kg.
25 x height cmo.2s) X 0.007184.
              In some embodiments of the methods disclosed herein, the compound of Formula I may be
   administered, for example, from a single dose to multiple doses per week, although in some embodiments
   the methods of the present invention may be performed by administering the compound of Formula I at a
   frequency outside this range. In some embodiments, the compound of Formula I may be administered
30 from about once per month to about five times per week. In some embodiments, the compound of
   Formula I is administered once per week.
              Since the compound of Formula I can be formulated to provide reduced systemic levels of the
   compound while inducing a high levels of cytokines, it is believed to be very useful for providing an
35 enhanced local immune response while minimizing undesirable systemic side effects. This may be
   advantageous for many uses, such as direct administration to a tumor and/or as a vaccine adjuvant.
