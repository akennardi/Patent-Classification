   ANTIBODY VARIANTS HAVING MODIFICATIONS IN THE CONSTANT REGION
   FIELD OF INVENTION
            The present invention relates to modified antibodies that may be used in
   therapeutic applications. The invention also relates to methods for producing the
 5 antibodies, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the antibodies and use thereof
   for different therapeutic applications.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
            Native   antibodies   and   immunoglobulins     are   usually   heterotetrameric
   glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains
10 and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one
   covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the
   heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each light chain is comprised of a
   light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant
   region (abbreviated herein as CL). Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain
15 variable region (VH) and a heavy chain constant region (CH) consisting of three
   domain, CH1, CH2 and CH3). CH1 and CH2 of the heavy chain are separated from
   each other by the so-called hinge region. The hinge region normally comprises one
   or more cysteine residues, which may form disulphide bridges with the cysteine
   residues of the hinge region of the other heavy chain in the antibody molecule.
20          Recently, antibodies have become a major focus area for therapeutic
   applications, and many antibody drug products have been approved or are in the
   process of being approved for use as therapeutic drugs. The desired characteristics
   of therapeutic antibodies may vary according to the specific condition which is to be
   treated. For some indications, only antigen binding is required, for instance where the
25 therapeutic effect of the antibody is to block interaction between the antigen and one
   or more specific molecules otherwise capable of binding to the antigen. For such
   indications, the use of Fab fragments, the only function of which is to bind antigen,
   may be preferred. For other indications, further effects may also be required, such as
   for instance the ability to induce complement activation and/or the ability to for
30 instance bind Fc receptors, protect from catabolism, recruit immune cells, etc. For
   such use, other parts of the antibody molecule, such as the Fc region, may be
   required. Some full-length antibodies may exhibit agonistic effects (which may be
   considered to be undesirable) upon binding to the target antigen, even though the
   antibody works as an antagonist when used as a Fab fragment. In some instances,
35 this effect may be attributed to "cross-linking" of the bivalent antibodies, which in turn

                                                    2
   promotes target dimerization, which may lead to activation, especially when the
   target is a receptor. In the case of soluble antigens, dimerization may form
   undesirable immune complexes.
            For some indications, monovalent antibodies may thus be preferable. The
 5 presently available Fab fragments show inferior pharmacokinetics due to their small
   size resulting to filtration in the kidneys as well as their inability to interact with the
   Brambell receptor FcRn (Junghans RP et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 93(11), 5512-6
   (1996)), therefore being unstable in vivo and having very rapid clearance after
   administration.
10          There is thus a need for stable monovalent antibodies which can be used as
   therapeutics.
            Dimeric, monovalent antibodies (Fab/c), wherein the Fc region comprises two
    Fc polypeptides, have been described (W0200563816 to Genentech and Parham P,
   J Immunol. 131(6), 2895-902 (1983).
15          Ig half-molecules, which have a dimeric configuration consisting of only one
   light chain and only one heavy chain, have been described as the result of rare
   deletions in human and murine plasmacytomas. Studies on the biochemical nature of
   these half-molecules showed that they consist of IgG1 molecules in which the heavy
   chain CH1, hinge and CH2 regions appeared normal, whereas deletions were found
20 in the CH3 region. The mutations appeared to be located in CH3 and the hinge
   peptide appeared normal (Hobbs, JR et al., Clin Exp Immunol 5, 199 (1969); Hobbs,
   JR, Br Med J 2, 67 (1971); Spiegelberg, HL et al., Blood 45, 305 (1975); Spiegelberg,
    HL et al., Biochemistry 14, 2157 (1975); Seligmann ME et al., Ann Immunol (Paris)
    129C, 855-870 (1978); Gallango, ML et al., Blut 48, 91 (1983)). It was also showed
25 that this human IgG1 half-molecule is rapidly catabolized (half-life in man was 4.3
   days) and, in monomeric form, is unable to bind Clq or Fc receptors on human
   lymphocytes, monocytes or neutrophils (Spiegelberg, HL. J Clin Invest 56, 588
   (1975)).
            Murine IgA half-molecules which were generated by somatic mutation have
30 also been described (Mushinski, JF, J Immunol 106, 41 (1971); Mushinski, JF et al.,
   J Immunol 117, 1668 (1976); Potter, M et al., J Mol Biol 93, 537 (1964); Robinson,
    EA et al., J Biol Chem 249, 6605 (1974); Zack, DJ et al., J Exp Med 154, 1554
   (1981)). These molecules were shown to all contain deletions of the CH3 domain or
   mutations at the CH2-CH3 boundary.
35          W02007059782         (Genmab)    describes   human     monovalent       antibodies
   comprising a light chain and a heavy chain, wherein

                                                  3
            a) said light chain comprises the amino acid sequence of the variable (VL)
   region of a selected antigen specific antibody and the amino acid sequence of the
   constant (CL) region of an Ig, and wherein, in case of an IgG1 subtype, the amino
   sequence of the constant (CL) region has been modified so that it does not contain
 5 any amino acids capable of participating in the formation of disulfide bonds or
   covalent bonds with other peptides comprising an identical amino acid sequence of
   the constant (CL) region of the Ig, in the presence of polyclonal human IgG or when
   administered to an animal or human being, and
            b) said heavy chain comprises the amino acid sequence of the variable (VH)
10 region of said selected antigen specific antibody and the amino acid sequence of the
   constant (CH) region of human Ig, wherein the amino acid sequence of the constant
   (CH) region has been modified so that the hinge region and, as required by the Ig
   subtype, other regions of the CH region, such as the CH3 region, does not contain
   any amino acid residues which participate in the formation of disulphide bonds or
15 covalent or stable non-covalent inter-heavy chain bonds with other peptides
   comprising an identical amino acid sequence of the constant (CN) region of the
   human Ig, in the presence of polyclonal human IgG or when administered to an
   animal or human being.
            As shown in W02007059782, these monovalent antibodies have a more
20 favorable in vivo half-life than Fab fragments. W02008145140 describes variants of
   these monovalent antibodies wherein intermolecular CH3-CH3 interactions are
   destabilized. The present application describes alternative and improved variants of
   the monovalent antibodies disclosed in W02007059782 and W02008145140. These
   variants remain monovalent even under conditions that favor intermolecular CH3
25 CH3 interactions.
            Human IgG4 molecules exist in various molecular forms which differ by the
   absence or presence of inter-heavy chain disulphide bonds located in the hinge
   region. Thus IgG4 molecules exist in which two, one or no inter-heavy chain
   disulphide bonds have been formed (Schuurman, J. et al., Mol Immunol 38, 1
30 (2001)). Under physiological conditions, these molecular forms of IgG4 may be in
   equilibrium with each other. Human IgG4s exist as tetramers in solution consisting of
   two Ig heavy and two light chains, as common for immunoglobulin G molecules,
   irrespective of the absence or presence of these interchain disulphide bonds
   (Schuurman 2001 supra; Gregory, L. et al. Mol Immunol 24, 821 (1987)). Only upon
35 denaturation under non-reducing conditions, the two non-covalently associated half
   molecules dissociate as demonstrated by size-determination analysis such as SDS
   PAGE (Schuurman, J. et al. Mol Immunol 38, 1 (2001); Deng, L. et al. Biotechnol

                                                   4
   Apple Biochem 40, 261 (2004)). It has been shown that mutation of the residues of the
   hinge region which are involved in inter-chain disulphide bond formation or deletion
   of the hinge region lead to creation of a homogeneous pool of IgG4 molecules in
   solution, which pool consists of tetrameric molecules consisting of two light chains
 5 and two heavy chains (Schuurman, J. et al. Mol Immunol 38, 1 (2001); Horgan, C. et
   al. J Immunol 150, 5400 (1993)). The IgG4 hinge-deleted and mutated antibodies
   also demonstrated an improved capability of antigen crosslinking when compared to
   native IgG4 molecules (Horgan, C. (1993) supra).
           It has been shown that administration of two recombinant monoclonal IgG4
10 antibodies having different antigen-binding specificities to a mouse leads to in vivo
   formation of bispecific antibodies. The phenomenon can be reproduced in vitro by
   incubating IgG4 antibodies with cells or under reducing conditions. It has been shown
   that IgG4 antibodies having different antigen-binding specificities engage in Fab arm
   exchange which is stochastic and in which all IgG4 molecules seem to participate.
15 Thus, IgG4 antibodies form bispecific antibodies without concomitant formation of
   aggregates.
           IgG4 antibodies therefore have unusual properties which are undesirable in
   vivo: IgG4 antibodies are unstable, dynamic, molecules which engage in Fab arm
   exchange.      An   administered therapeutic    IgG4 antibody    may    exchange with
20 endogenous IgG4 antibodies with undesired specificities. The random nature of this
   process     introduces   unpredictability which   is highly   undesirable for    human
   immunotherapy.
           In one aspect, the present invention relates to stabilized forms of IgG4
   antibodies that have a reduced ability to undergo Fab-arm exchange. Stabilized
25 forms of IgG4 have previously been described in W02008145142 (Genmab). It has
   now surprisingly been found that specific alternative substitutions in human IgG4 can
   prevent Fab arm exchange, and thus stabilize IgG4.
           In summary, the present invention relates to positions in the constant region
   of antibodies, in particular the CH3 region of IgG4, which affect the strength of CH3
30 CH3 interactions. Mutations that either stabilize or destabilize this interaction are
   disclosed herein.
           When      introduced   in the    monovalent  antibody   context   described  in
   W02007059782, the destabilizing mutations contribute to keeping the antibodies
   monovalent even under conditions that favor intermolecular CH3-CH3 interactions.
35 When introduced in the IgG4 context, the stabilizing mutations contribute to
   preventing undesired Fab arm exchange.

                                                   5
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
    In a first main aspect, the invention relates to a monovalent antibody, which
   comprises
            (i)     a variable region of a selected antigen specific antibody or an antigen
 5 binding part of the said region, and
            (ii)    a CH region of an immunoglobulin or a fragment thereof comprising
   the CH2 and CH3 regions, wherein the CH region or fragment thereof has been
   modified such that the region corresponding to the hinge region and, if the
   immunoglobulin is not an IgG4 subtype, other regions of the CH region, such as the
10 CH3 region, do not comprise any amino acid residues which are capable of forming
   disulfide bonds with an identical CH region or other covalent or stable non-covalent
   inter-heavy chain bonds with an identical CH region in the presence of polyclonal
   human IgG,
            wherein the antibody is of the IgG4 type and the constant region of the heavy
15 chain has been modified so that one or more of the following amino acid substitutions
   have been made relative to the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4: Tyr (Y) in
   position 217 has been replaced by Arg (R), Leu (L) in position 219 has been replaced
   by Asn (N) or GIn (Q), Glu (E) in position 225 has been replaced by Thr (T), Val (V)
   or lie (I), Ser (S) in position 232 has been replaced by Arg (R) or Lys (K), Thr (T) in
20 position 234 has been replaced by Arg (R), Lys (K) or Asn (N), Leu (L) in position 236
   has been replaced by Ser (S) or Thr (T), Lys (K) in position 238 has been replaced
   by Arg (R), Asp (D) in position 267 has been replaced by Thr (T) or Ser (S), Phe (F)
   in position 273 has been replaced by Arg (R), GIn (Q), Lys (K) or Tyr (Y), Tyr (Y) in
   position 275 has been replaced by GIn (Q), Lys (K) or Phe (F), Arg (R) in position
25 277 has been replaced by Glu (E), Thr (T) in position 279 has been replaced by Asp
   (D), Val (V) and Asn (N),
            or the antibody is of another IgG type and the constant region of the heavy
   chain has been modified so that one or more of the same amino-acid substitutions
   have been made at the positions that correspond to the before-mentioned positions
30 for IgG4.
            As explained above, mutations at the above specified positions disfavor
   intermolecular CH3-CH3 interactions. Thus, monovalent antibodies carrying these
   mutations are less likely to dimerize through non-covalent interactions. This may be
   an advantage for therapeutic applications wherein such dimerization is highly
35 undesired. Furthermore, a reduced tendency of the monovalent antibodies to
   associate non-covalently through the CH3 regions may make pharmaceutical

                                                   6
   compositions comprising such antibodies more stable and homogenous than
   pharmaceutical compositions of monovalent antibodies that do not comprise the
   above-specified mutations.
           Thus,    in another aspect, the      invention   relates to a    pharmaceutical
 5 composition comprising the monovalent antibody according the invention as defined
   herein.
           In a further aspect, the invention relates to a method of treating a disease or
   disorder as described herein, wherein said method comprises administering to a
   subject in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a monovalent
10 antibody according to the invention.
           In a further aspect, the invention relates to a stabilized IgG4 antibody for use
   as a medicament, comprising a heavy chain and a light chain, wherein said heavy
   chain comprises a human IgG4 constant region having the sequence set forth in
   SEQ ID NO:2, wherein Lys (K) in position 250 has been replaced by GIn (Q) or Glu
15 (E) and wherein the antibody optionally comprises one or more further substitutions,
   deletions and/or insertions in the constant region as set forth in SEQ ID NO:2.
           As explained above, and shown herein below in the Examples, the mutations
   at position 250 stabilize the IgG4 molecule and prevent undesired Fab arm
   exchange.

30 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   Definitions
            The term "antibody" as referred to herein includes whole antibody molecules,
   antigen binding fragments, monovalent antibodies, and single chains thereof.
   Antibody molecules belong to a family of plasma proteins called immunoglobulins,
35 whose basic building block, the immunoglobulin fold or domain, is used in various

                                                  9
   forms in many molecules of the immune system and other biological recognition
   systems. Native antibodies and immunoglobulins are usually heterotetrameric
   glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains
   and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one
 5 covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the
   heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain may
   also have regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each light chain is comprised
   of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant
   region (abbreviated herein as CL). Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain
10 variable region (VH) and a heavy chain constant region (CH) consisting of three
   domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3, and the hinge region). The three CH domains and the
   hinge region have been indicated for IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 in SEQ ID NO: 7, 8,
   9 and 2, respectively (see below) The constant domain of the light chain is aligned
   with the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable
15 domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain forming what is known
   as the "Fab fragment". CH1 and CH2 of the heavy chain are separated form each
   other by the so-called hinge region, which allows the Fab "arms" of the antibody
   molecule to swing to some degree. The hinge region normally comprises one or
   more cysteine residues, which are capable of forming disulphide bridges with the
20 cysteine residues of the hinge region of the other heavy chain in the antibody
   molecule.
           The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain
   that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate
   the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of
25 the immune system (for instance effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the
   classical complement system
            Depending on the amino acid sequences of the constant domain of their
   heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are at
   least five (5) major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, and
30 several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), for instance IgG1,
   IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4; IgAl and IgA2. The genes for the heavy chains constant
   domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha
   (a), delta (6), epsilon (F), gamma (y) and mu (p), respectively. Immunoglobulin
   subclasses are encoded by different genes such as yl, y2, y3 and y4. The genes for
35 the light chains of antibodies are assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called
   kappa   (K) and lambda (A), based on the amino sequences of their constant domain.
   The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of

                                                   10
   immunoglobulins are well known. Distinct allotypes of immunoglobulins exist within
   the human population such as G1m(a), G1m(x), G1m(f) and G1m(z) for IgG1 heavy
   chain and Km1, Km1,2 and Km3 for the kappa light chain. These allotypes differ at
   distinct amino acids in their region encoding the constant regions.
 5          The term antibody also encompasses "derivatives" of antibodies, wherein one
   or more of the amino acid residues have been derivatised, for instance by acylation
   or glycosylation, without significantly affecting or altering the binding characteristics
   of the antibody containing the amino acid sequences.
            In addition, the term antibody covers variants, e.g. variants wherein the in vivo
10 half-life of the antibodies has been improved by modifying the salvage receptor
   epitope of the Ig constant domain or an Ig-like constant domain such that the
   molecule does not comprise an intact CH2 domain or an intact Ig Fc region, cf.
   US 6121022 and US 6194551. The in vivo half-life may be furthermore increased by
   making mutations in the Fc region, for instance by substituting threonine for leucine
15 at the position corresponding to position 252 of an intact antibody molecule,
   threonine for serine at the position corresponding to position 254 of an intact antibody
   molecule, or threonine for phenylalanine at the position corresponding to position 256
   of an intact antibody molecule, cf. US 6277375.
            Furthermore, antibodies, and particularly Fab or other fragments, may be
20 pegylated to increase the half-life. This can be carried out by pegylation reactions
   known in the art, as described, for example, in Focus on Growth Factors 3, 4-10
   (1992), EP 154 316 and EP 401 384.
            The term "antibody half-molecule" is used herein to mean an antibody
   molecule as described above, but comprising no more than one light chain and no
25 more than one heavy chain, and which exists in water solutions as a heterodimer of
   said single light and single heavy chain. Such antibody is by nature monovalent as
   only one antigen-binding portion is present.
            The term "human antibody", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies
   having variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin
30 sequences. The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues
   not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (for instance mutations
   introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in
   vivo). However, the term "human antibody", as used herein, is not intended to include
   antibodies in which CDR1 or CDR2 sequences derived from the germline of another
35 mammalian species, such as a mouse, or the CDR3 region derived from an antibody
   from another species, such as mouse, have been grafted onto human framework
   sequences. Human monoclonal antibodies directed may be generated                     using

                                                   11
   transgenic or transchromosomal mice carrying parts of the human immune system
   rather than the mouse system. Such transgenic and transchromosomic mice include
   mice referred to herein as HuMAb mice and KM mice, respectively, and are
   collectively referred to herein as "transgenic mice".
 5          The HuMAb mouse contains a human immunoglobulin gene miniloci that
   encodes unrearranged human heavy (p and y) and            K light chain immunoglobulin
   sequences, together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous p and      K
   chain loci (Lonberg, N. et al., Nature 368, 856-859 (1994)). Accordingly, the mice
   exhibit reduced expression of mouse IgM or      K and in response to immunization, the
10 introduced human heavy and light chain transgenes, undergo class switching and
   somatic mutation to generate high affinity human IgG,K monoclonal antibodies

            The HCo7 mice have a JKD disruption in their endogenous light chain
   (kappa) genes (as described in Chen et al., EMBO J. 12, 821-830 (1993)), a CMD
25 disruption in their endogenous heavy chain genes (as described in Example 1 of WO
   01/14424), a KCo5 human kappa light chain transgene (as described in Fishwild et
   al., Nature Biotechnology 14, 845-851 (1996)), and a HCo7 human heavy chain
   transgene (as described in US 5,770,429).
            The HCo12 mice have a JKD disruption in their endogenous light chain
30 (kappa) genes (as described in Chen et al., EMBO J. 12, 821-830 (1993)), a CMD
   disruption in their endogenous heavy chain genes (as described in Example 1 of WO
   01/14424), a KCo5 human kappa light chain transgene (as described in Fishwild et
   al., Nature Biotechnology 14, 845-851 (1996)), and a HCo12 human heavy chain
   transgene (as described in Example 2 of WO 01/14424).
35          In the KM mouse strain, the endogenous mouse kappa light chain gene has
   been homozygously disrupted as described in Chen et al., EMBO J. 12, 811-820
   (1993) and the endogenous mouse heavy chain gene has been homozygously

                                                  12
   disrupted as described in Example 1 of WO 01/09187. This mouse strain carries a
   human kappa light chain transgene, KCo5, as described in Fishwild et al., Nature
   Biotechnology 14, 845-851 (1996). This mouse strain also carries a human heavy
   chain transchromosome composed of chromosome 14 fragment hCF (SC20) as
 5 described in WO 02/43478.
           Splenocytes from      these transgenic mice      may be used         to generate
   hybridomas that secrete human monoclonal stabilized IgG4 antibodies according to
   well known techniques. Such transgenic non-human animals, non-human animals
   comprising an operable nucleic acid sequence coding for expression of antibody
10 used in the invention, non-human animals stably transfected with one or more target
   encoding nucleic acid sequences, and the like, are additional features of the present
   invention. The term   "KD"  (M), as used herein, refers to the dissociation equilibrium
   constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.
           The terms "monoclonal antibody" or "monoclonal antibody composition" as
15 used herein refer to a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular
   composition. A monoclonal antibody composition displays a single binding specificity
   and affinity for a particular epitope. Accordingly, the term "human monoclonal
   antibody" refers to antibodies displaying a single binding specificity which have
   variable and constant regions derived from           human germline immunoglobulin
20 sequences.
           The term "monovalent antibody" means in the present context that an
   antibody molecule is capable of binding a single molecule of the antigen, and thus is
   not able of antigen crosslinking.
           As used herein, "specific binding"' refers to the binding of an antibody, or
25 antigen-binding fragment thereof, to a predetermined antigen. Typically, the antibody
   binds with an affinity corresponding to a   KD of about 10-7 M or less, such as about
   10-8 M or less, such as about 10-9 M or less, about 10-10 M or less, or about 10-11 M or
   even less, when measured for instance using sulfon plasmon resonance on BlAcore
   or as apparent affinities based on IC50 values in FACS or ELISA, and binds to the
30 predetermined antigen with an affinity corresponding to a    KD  that is at least ten-fold
   lower, such as at least 100 fold lower, for instance at least 1000 fold lower, such as
   at least 10,000 fold lower, for instance at least 100,000 fold lower than its affinity for
   binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined
   antigen or a closely-related antigen. The amount with which the affinity is lower is
35 dependent on the     KD  of the antigen binding peptide, so that when the       KD  of the
   antigen binding peptide is very low (that is, the antigen binding peptide is highly

                                                   13
   specific), then the amount with which the affinity for the antigen is lower than the
   affinity for a non-specific antigen may be at least 10,000 fold.
            The terms "transgenic, non-human animal" refers to a non-human animal
   having a genome comprising one or more human heavy and/or light chain
 5 transgenes or transchromosomes (either integrated or non-integrated into the
   animal's natural genomic DNA) and which is capable of expressing human
   antibodies. For example, a transgenic mouse can have a human light chain
   transgene and either a human heavy chain transgene or human heavy chain
   transchromosome,       such   that the   mouse    produces    human    antibodies when
10 immunized with an antigen and/or cells expressing an antigen. The human heavy
   chain transgene can be integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the mouse, as is the
   case for transgenic, for instance HuMAb mice, such as HCo7 or HCo12 mice, or the
   human heavy chain transgene can be maintained extrachromosomally, as is the case
   for transchromosomal KM mice as described in WO 02/43478. Such transgenic and
15 transchromosomal mice are capable of producing multiple classes and isotypes of
   monovalent antibodies to a given antigen (for instance IgM, IgG, IgA and/or IgE) by
   undergoing V-D-J recombination and isotype switching.
            The term "acceptor site for N-linked glycosylation" refers to a site on a
   polypeptide which is susceptible of becoming glycosylated on an Asn residue. The
20 typical consensus site for this type of glycosylation is Asn-X-Ser/Thr, wherein X can
   be any amino acid, except for Pro.
            As explained above, the characteristic IgG structure in which two heavy-light
   chain heterodimers are linked is maintained by the inter-heavy chain disulphide
25 bridges of the hinge region and the non-covalent interactions of the CH3 domains.
             It has been shown in W02007059782 that removal of the hinge region in
    IgG4 results in the formation of monovalent antibodies in which the linkage between
   the two heavy-light chain heterodimers is lost or diminished. Consequently, changes
   in hinge region disulphide bridges of other IgG subclasses alone or in combination
30 with mutations in the CH3 domain interactions may result in the formation of
   monovalent antibodies for these other subclasses as well.          It is well within the
   capability of the skilled artisan to use the intimate knowledge of structure of Ig
   subclasses, and the knowledge provided in the present invention, to select and to
   modify selected amino acids to prevent light chain interactions.
35
    In a first main aspect, the invention relates to a monovalent antibody, which
   comprises

                                                  14
           (i)     a variable region of a selected antigen specific antibody or an antigen
   binding part of the said region, and
           (ii)    a CH region of an immunoglobulin or a fragment thereof comprising
   the CH2 and CH3 regions, wherein the CH region or fragment thereof has been
 5 modified such that the region corresponding to the hinge region and, if the
   immunoglobulin is not an IgG4 subtype, other regions of the CH region, such as the
   CH3 region, do not comprise any amino acid residues which are capable of forming
   disulfide bonds with an identical CH region or other covalent or stable non-covalent
   inter-heavy chain bonds with an identical CH region in the presence of polyclonal
10 human IgG,
           wherein the antibody is of the IgG4 type and the constant region of the heavy
   chain has been modified so that one or more of the following amino acid substitutions
   have been made relative the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4: Tyr (Y) in position
   217 has been replaced by Arg (R), Leu (L) in position 219 has been replaced by Asn
15 (N) or GIn (Q), Glu (E) in position 225 has been replaced by Thr (T), Val (V) or lie (I),
   Ser (S) in position 232 has been replaced by Arg (R) or Lys (K), Thr (T) in position
   234 has been replaced by Arg (R), Lys (K) or Asn (N), Leu (L) in position 236 has
   been replaced by Ser (S) or Thr (T), Lys (K) in position 238 has been replaced by Arg
   (R), Asp (D) in position 267 has been replaced by Thr (T) or Ser (S), Phe (F) in
20 position 273 has been replaced by Arg (R), GIn (Q), Lys (K) or Tyr (Y), Tyr (Y) in
   position 275 has been replaced by GIn (Q), Lys (K) or Phe (F), Arg (R) in position
   277 has been replaced by Glu (E), Thr (T) in position 279 has been replaced by Asp
   (D), Val (V) and Asn (N),
           or the antibody is of another IgG type and the constant region of the heavy
25 chain has been modified so that one or more of the same amino-acid substitutions
   have been made at the positions that correspond to the before-mentioned positions
   for IgG4. See e.g. SEQ ID NO: 7, 8 and 9 for the corresponding positions in other
   isotypes.
            In one embodiment, the monovalent antibody comprises
30         (i)     a variable region of a selected antigen specific antibody or an antigen
   binding part of the said region, and
           (ii)    a CH region of an immunoglobulin or a fragment thereof comprising
   the CH2 and CH3 regions, wherein the CH region or fragment thereof has been
   modified such that the region corresponding to the hinge region and, if the
35 immunoglobulin is not an IgG4 subtype, other regions of the CH region, such as the
   CH3 region, do not comprise any amino acid residues which are capable of forming
   disulfide bonds with an identical CH region or other covalent or stable non-covalent

                                                  15
   inter-heavy chain bonds with an identical CH region in the presence of polyclonal
   human IgG,
            wherein the antibody is of the IgG4 type and the constant region of the heavy
   chain has been modified so that one or more of the following amino acid substitutions
 5 have been made relative the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4: Glu (E) in position
   225 has been replaced by Val (V), Ser (S) in position 232 has been replaced by Arg
   (R), Leu (L) in position 236 has been replaced by Ser (S) or Thr (T), Asp (D) in
   position 267 has been replaced by Thr (T) or Ser (S), Phe (F) in position 273 has
   been replaced by Arg (R), GIn (Q) or Tyr (Y), Tyr (Y) in position 275 has been
10 replaced by GIn (Q) or Lys (K).
            In another embodiment, the antibody is of the IgG4 type and the constant
   region of the heavy chain has been modified so that one or more of the following
   combinations of amino acid substitutions have been made relative the sequence set
   forth in SEQ ID NO: 4:
15 - Asp (D) in position 267 has been replaced by Ser (S) and Tyr (Y) in position 275
   has been replaced by GIn (Q) or Lys (K), Arg (R),
   - Asp (D) in position 267 has been replaced by Thr (T) and Tyr (Y) in position 275
   has been replaced by GIn (Q) or Lys (K), Arg (R),
            or the antibody is of another IgG type and the constant region of the heavy
20 chain has been modified so that the same combinations of amino-acid substitutions
   have been made at the positions that correspond to the before-mentioned positions
   for IgG4.
            Typically, the variable region and the CH region of the monovalent antibody
   are connected to each other via peptide bonds and are produced from a single open
25 reading frame. Without being bound to any theory, it is believed that the monovalent
   antibodies according to the invention are capable of binding to the FcRn. Such
   binding may be determined by use of methods for determining binding as it is known
   in the art, for instance by use of ELISA assays. The binding of a monovalent antibody
   of the invention to FcRn may for instance be compared to the binding of a F(ab') 2
30 fragment, which F(ab') 2 fragment has a VH region and a VL region, which are
   identical to the VH region and the VL region of the monovalent antibody of the
   invention, to FcRn in the same assay. In one embodiment, the binding of a
   monovalent antibody of the invention to FcRn is more than 10 times stronger than the
   binding of the F(ab') 2 fragment to FcRn.
35          In one embodiment, the antibody (further) comprises a CH1 region.
            In another embodiment, the monovalent antibody consists of said variable
   region and said CH region.

                                                  16
           In another embodiment, the variable region is a VH region. In a further
   embodiment, the variable region is a VL region. In an even further embodiment, the
   antibody does not comprise a CL region.
           In an important embodiment, the monovalent antibody of the invention
 5 comprises a heavy chain and a light chain, wherein the heavy chain comprises
           (i) a VH region of a selected antigen specific antibody or an antigen binding
           part of the said region, and
           (ii) a CH region as defined above,
   and the light chain comprises
10         (i) a VL region of a selected antigen specific antibody or an antigen binding
           part of the said region, and
           (ii) a CL region which, in case of an IgG1 subtype, has been modified such
           that the CL region does not contain any amino acids, which are capable of
           forming disulfide bonds with an identical CL region or other covalent bonds
15         with an identical CL region in the presence of polyclonal human IgG.
           Typically, the light chain and the heavy chain of the monovalent antibody
   defined above are connected to each other via one or more disulfide bonds. It is
   evident that for such disulphide bonds, neither of the binding partners in the
   disulphide bond is present in the region corresponding to the hinge region. In one
20 embodiment however the light chain and the heavy chain of the monovalent antibody
   are connected to each other via one or more amide bonds.
           Furthermore, typically, the VL region and the CL region of the light chain are
   connected to each other via peptide bonds and produced from a single open reading
   frame.
25         In one embodiment, the VH and VL region of an antibody molecule of the
   invention are derived from the same antigen specific antibody.
           According to the invention, the sequence of the CL region of the light chain of
   the antibody molecule may be derived from the sequence of CL region of an
   immunoglobulin. In one embodiment, the CL region is the constant region of the
30 kappa light chain of human IgG. In one embodiment, the CL region comprises the
   amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No: 2. In one embodiment, the CL region is the
   constant region of the lambda light chain of human IgG. In one embodiment, the CL
   region comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No: 4.
           In one embodiment, the monovalent antibody of the invention is an IgG1,
35 IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA or IgD antibody, such as an IgG1, IgG2 or IgG4 antibody. In a
   further embodiment, the monovalent antibody is a human antibody.

                                                   17
             A monovalent antibody of the present invention may also be a variant of any
   of the above isotypes. For example, a variant IgG4 antibody may be an antibody that
   differs from a IgG4 antibody by one or more suitable amino acid residue alterations,
   that is substitutions, deletions, insertions, or terminal sequence additions, for
 5 instance in the constant domain, and/or the variable regions (or any one or more
   CDRs thereof) in a single variant antibody. Typically, amino acid sequence
   alterations, desirably do not substantially change the structural characteristics of the
   parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to disrupt
   secondary structure that characterizes the function of the parent sequence), but
10 which may be associated with advantageous properties, such as changing the
   functional or pharmacokinetic properties of the antibodies, for example increasing the
   half-life, altering the immunogenicity, providing a site for covalent or non-covalent
   binding to another molecule, reducing susceptibility to proteolysis or reducing
   susceptibility to oxidation. Examples of variants include variants which have a
15 modification of the CH3 region, such as a substitution or deletion at any one or more
   of the positions 225, 234, 236, 238, 273 or 275 of SEQ ID NO: 4 or the
   corresponding residues in non-IgG4 isotypes. Modifications at these positions may
   e.g. further reduce intermolecular interactions between hinge-modified antibodies of
   the invention. Other examples include variants which have a modification of the
20 constant region, such as a substitution or deletion, at any one or more of the
   positions 118, 120, 122, 124, 175, 248, 296, 302 of SEQ ID NO: 4 or the
   corresponding residues in non-IgG4 isotypes. Modifications at these positions may
   e.g. increase the half-life of hinge-modified antibodies of the invention.
             In one embodiment, the monovalent antibody of the invention comprises the
25 CH3 region as set as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 7, but wherein the CH3 region has
   been modified so that one or more of the following amino acid substitutions have
   been made: Arg (R) in position 238 has been replaced by GIn (Q); Asp (D) in position
   239 has been replaced by Glu (E); Thr (T) in position 249 has been replaced by Ala
   (A); Leu (L) in position 251 has been replaced by Ala (A); Leu (L) in position 251 has
30 been replaced by Val (V); Phe (F) in position 288 has been replaced by Ala (A); Phe
   (F) in position 288 has been replaced by Leu (L); Tyr (Y) in position 290 has been
   replaced by Ala (A); Lys (K) in position 292 has been replaced by Arg (R); Lys (K) in
   position 292 has been replaced by Ala (A); GIn (Q) in position 302 has been replaced
   by Glu (E); and Pro (P) in position 328 has been replaced by Leu (L).
35           In a further embodiment hereof, one or more of the following amino acid
   substitutions have been made: Arg (R) in position 238 has been replaced by GIn (Q);
   Asp (D) in position 239 has been replaced by Glu (E); Lys (K) in position 292 has

                                                    18
   been replaced by Arg (R); Gin (Q) in position 302 has been replaced by Glu (E); and
   Pro (P) in position 328 has been replaced by Leu (L). In an even further embodiment:
     (i) Arg (R) in position 238 has been replaced by Gin (Q),
   (ii) Arg (R) in position 238 has been replaced by Gin (Q), and Pro (P) in position 328
 5 has been replaced by Leu (L), or
   (iii) all five substitutions as defined above have been made.
               In another further embodiment hereof, the monovalent antibody further
   comprises the CH1 and/or CH2 regions as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 7, with the
   proviso that the CH2 region has been modified so that it does not comprise any
10 acceptor sites for N-linked glycosylation.
               In one embodiment, the monovalent antibody of the invention comprises the
   kappa CL region having the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 6, but
   wherein the sequence has been modified so that the terminal cysteine residue in
   position 106 has been replaced with another amino acid residue or has been deleted.
15             In another embodiment, the monovalent antibody of the invention comprises

              In further embodiments, the monovalent antibody according to the invention

   by Ala (A).
            In a yet other embodiment, the monovalent antibody comprises the CH2

25 replaced by Ala (A) and Thr (T) in position 175 has been replaced by Ala (A) and Glu

                                                  22
           In one embodiment of the invention, the monovalent antibody does not bind to
   the synthetic antigen (Tyr, Glu)-Ala-Lys.
           The hinge region is a region of an antibody situated between the CH1 and
   CH2 regions of the constant domain of the heavy chain. The extent of the hinge
 5 region is determined by the separate exon, which encodes the hinge region. The
   hinge region is normally involved in participating in ensuring the correct assembly of
   the four peptide chains of an antibody into the traditional tetrameric form via the
   formation of disulphide bonds, or bridges, between one or more cysteine residues in
   the hinge region of one of the heavy chains and one or more cysteine residues in the
10 hinge region of the other heavy chain. A modification of the hinge region so that none
   of the amino acid residues in the hinge region are capable of participating in the
   formation of disulphide bonds may thus for instance comprise the deletion and/or
   substitution of the cysteine residues present in the unmodified hinge region. A region
   corresponding to the hinge region should for the purpose of this specification be
15 construed to mean the region between region CH1 and CH2 of a heavy chain of an
   antibody. In the context of the present invention, such a region may also comprise no
   amino acid residues at all, corresponding to a deletion of the hinge region, resulting
   in the CH1 and CH2 regions being connected to each other without any intervening
   amino acid residues. Such a region may also comprise only one or a few amino acid
20 residues, which residues need not be the amino acid residues present in the N- or
   C-terminal of the original hinge region.
           Accordingly, in one embodiment of the antibody of the invention, the CH
   region has been modified such that the region corresponding to the hinge region of
   the CH region does not comprise any cysteine residues. In another embodiment, the
25 CH region has been modified such that at least all cysteine residues have been
   deleted and/or substituted with other amino acid residues. In a further embodiment,
   the CH region has been modified such that the cysteine residues of the hinge region
   have been substituted with amino acid residues that have an uncharged polar side
   chain or a nonpolar side chain. Preferably, the amino acids with uncharged polar side
30 chains are independently selected from asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine,
   tyrosine, and tryptophan, and the amino acid with the nonpolar side chain are
   independently     selected   from   alanine,   valine,  leucine,  isoleucine,  proline,
   phenylalanine, and methionine.
           In an even further embodiment, the monovalent antibody is a human IgG4,
35 wherein the amino acids corresponding to amino acids 106 and 109 of the CH
   sequence of SEQ ID No: 2 have been deleted.

                                                   23
            In a yet further embodiment, the monovalent antibody is a human IgG4,
   wherein one of the amino acid residues corresponding to amino acid residues 106
   and 109 of the sequence of SEQ ID No: 2 has been substituted with an amino acid
   residue different from cysteine, and the other of the amino acid residues
 5 corresponding to amino acid residues 106 and 109 of the sequence of SEQ ID No: 2
   has been deleted.
            In a yet further embodiment, the amino acid residue corresponding to amino
   acid residue 106 has been substituted with an amino acid residue different from
   cysteine, and the amino acid residue corresponding to amino acid residue 109 has
10 been deleted.
            In a yet further embodiment, the amino acid residue corresponding to amino
   acid residue 106 has been deleted, and the amino acid residue corresponding to
   amino acid residue 109 has been substituted with an amino acid residue different
   from cysteine.
15          In a yet further embodiment, the monovalent antibody is a human IgG4,
   wherein at least the amino acid residues corresponding to amino acid residues 106
   to 109 of the CH sequence of SEQ ID No: 2 have been deleted.
            In a yet further embodiment, the monovalent antibody is a human IgG4,
   wherein at least the amino acid residues corresponding to amino acid residues 99 to
20  110 of the sequence of SEQ ID No: 2 have been deleted.
            In a yet further embodiment, the CH region comprises the amino acid
   sequence of SEQ ID No: 4.
            In a yet even further embodiment, the monovalent antibody is a human IgG4,
   wherein the CH region has been modified such that the entire hinge region has been
25 deleted.
            In a further embodiment, the sequence of the antibody has been modified so
   that it does not comprise any acceptor sites for N-linked glycosylation. In a further
   embodiment hereof, the NST acceptor site for N-linked glycosylation in the CH2
   region has been modified to a sequence selected from the group consisting of: GST,
30 MST, CSE, DSE, DSP, ESP, GSP, HSE, NSE, PSP and SSE.
            In one embodiment, the monovalent antibody of the invention is monovalent
   in the presence of physiological concentrations of polyclonal human IgG.
            The antibodies of the present invention has the advantage of having a long
   half-life in vivo, leading to a longer therapeutic window, as compared to e.g. a FAB
35 fragment of the same antibody which has a considerably shorter half-life in vivo.
            Further, due to the long half-life and small size, the monovalent antibodies of
   the invention will have a potential having a better distribution in vivo, in example by

                                                    24
   being able to penetrate solid tumors. This leads to a great use potential of the
   monovalent antibodies of the invention, e.g. for treatment of cancer, since the
   antibodies of the invention could be used either to inhibit a target molecule, or as a
   target specific delivery mechanism for other drugs that would treat the disease.
 5          Accordingly, in one embodiment, the monovalent antibody of the invention
   has a plasma concentration above 10 pg/ml for more than 7 days when administered
   in vivo at a dose of 4 mg per kg, as measured in an pharmacokinetic study in SCID
   mice (for instance as shown in the W02007059782). The clearance rate of a
   monovalent antibody of the invention may be measured by use of pharmacokinetic
10 methods as it is known in the art. The antibody may for instance be injected
   intravenously (other routes such as i.p. or i.m. may also be used) in a human or
   animal after which blood samples are drawn by venipuncture at several time points,
   for instance 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days and 28 days
   after initial injection). The concentration of antibody in the serum is determined by an
15 appropriate assay such as ELISA. Pharmacokinetic analysis can performed as
   known in the art and described in W02007059782. Monovalent antibodies of the
   invention may have a plasma residence time, which is as much as 100 times longer
   than the plasma residence time of for instance Fab fragments which are frequently
   used as monovalent antibodies.
20          In one embodiment, a monovalent antibody of the invention has a plasma
   clearance, which is more than 10 times slower than the plasma clearance of a F(ab') 2
   fragment, which has a comparable molecular size. This may be an indication of the
   capability of the antibodies of the invention to bind to FcRn. FcRn is a major
   histocompatibility complex class I-related receptor and plays a role in the passive
25 delivery of immunoglobulin (Ig)Gs from mother to young and in the regulation of
   serum IgG levels by protecting IgG from intracellular degradation (Ghetie V et al.,
   Annu Rev Immunol. 18, 739-66 (2000)). In one embodiment, the F(ab') 2 fragment is
   directed at the same antigen as the monovalent antibody of the invention. In one
   embodiment, the F(ab') 2 fragment is directed at the same epitope as the monovalent
30 antibody of the invention. In one embodiment, the VH region and the VL region of the
   F(ab') 2 fragment are identical to the VH region and the VL region of the monovalent
   antibody of the invention.
            In one embodiment, a monovalent antibody of the invention has a half-life of
   at least 5 days when administered in vivo. The half-life of a monovalent antibody of
35 the invention may be measured by any method known in the art, for instance as
   described above.

                                                    25
            In one embodiment, a monovalent antibody of the invention has a half-life of
   at least 5 days and up to 14 days, when administered in vivo.
            In one embodiment, the monovalent antibody of the invention has a half-life of
   at least 5 days and up to 21 days, when administered in vivo.
 5          In an even further embodiment, the monovalent antibody has a serum half-life
   of at least 5 days, such as of at least 14 days, for example of from 5 and up to 21
   days when administered in vivo to a human being or a SCID mouse.
            In one embodiment, the monovalent antibody of the invention binds to a
   tumor antigen with a dissociation constant     (kd) of 10-7 M or less, such as 10-8 M or
10 less.
            In another embodiment, the monovalent antibody of the invention binds to a
   cell surface receptor with a dissociation constant   (kd) of 10-7 M or less, such as 10-8 M
   or less, which cell surface receptor is activated upon receptor dimerization.
            In a further embodiment, the monovalent antibody binds to a target with a
15 dissociation constant   (kd) of 10-7 M or less, such as 10-8 M or less, which target is
   selected from: erythropoietin, beta-amyloid, thrombopoietin, interferon-alpha (2a and
   2b), -beta (1b), -gamma, TNFR I (CD120a), TNFR II (CD120b), IL-1R type 1
   (CD121a), IL-1R type 2 (CD121b), IL-2, IL2R (CD25), IL-2R-beta (CD123), IL-3, IL-4,
    IL-3R (CD123), IL-4R (CD124), IL-5R (CD125), IL-6R-alpha (CD126), -beta (CD130),
20  IL-10, IL-11, IL-15BP, IL-15R, IL-20, IL-21, TCR variable chain, RANK, RANK-L,
   CTLA4, CXCR4R, CCR5R, TGF-betal, -beta2, -beta3, G-CSF, GM-CSF, MIF-R
   (CD74), M-CSF-R (CD115), GM-CSFR (CD116), soluble FcRI, sFcRII, sFcRIII,
    FcRn, Factor VII, Factor VIII, Factor IX, VEGF, VEGFxxxb, anti-psychotic drugs, anti
   depressant drugs, anti-Parkinson drugs, anti-seizure agents, neuromuscular blocking
25 drugs, anti-epileptic drugs, adrenocorticosteroids, insulin, proteins or enzymes
   involved in regulation of insulin, incretins (GIP and GLP-1) or drugs mimicking
   incretin action such as Exenatide and sitagliptin, thyroid hormones, growth hormone,
   ACTH, oestrogen, testosterone, anti-diuretic hormone, diuretics, blood products such
   as heparin and EPO, beta-blocking agents, cytotoxic agents, anti-viral drugs, anti
30 bacterial agents, anti-fungal agents, anti-parasitic drugs, anti-coagulation drugs, anti
   inflammatory drugs, anti-asthma drugs, anti-COPD drugs, Viagra, opiates, morphine,
   vitamins (such as vitamin C for conservation), hormones involved in pregnancy such
   as LH and FSH, hormones involved in sex changes, anti-conceptives and antibodies.
            In one embodiment, a monovalent antibody of the invention specifically binds
35 a cell surface receptor that is activated upon receptor dimerization. Monovalent
   antibodies, such as the monovalent antibodies of the invention, may often be useful
   in the treatment of diseases or disorders, where receptor activation is undesirable,

                                                   26
   since the antibody molecules of the inventions due to their monovalent nature are
   unable to induce such dimerization and thereby such activation. Without being limited
   to specific receptors, examples of such receptors could be erb-B1, erb-B2, erb-B3,
   erb-B4 and members of the ephrins and ephrin receptors such as ephrin-A1 through
 5 A6, ephAl through A8, ephrin B1 through B3 and eph-B1       through eph-B6.
           In one embodiment, a monovalent antibody of the invention, when bound to a
   target molecule, inhibits target molecule multimerization (such as dimerization).
   Again, monovalent antibodies, such as the monovalent antibodies of the invention,
   may often be useful in the treatment of diseases or disorders, where multimerization
10 of the target antigen is undesirable, since the antibody molecules of the inventions
   due to their monovalent nature are unable to induce such multimerization. In the case
   of soluble antigens, multimerization may form undesirable immune complexes.
   Without being limited to specific targets, examples of such targets could be Toll-like
   receptors such as TLR-3 and TLR-9, or angiopoietin-1, or angiopoietin-2, or TNF
15 receptor family members such as CD30, CD40 and CD95.
           In one embodiment, a monovalent antibody of the invention is an inhibitor of
   TNF-alpha. In one embodiment of the invention, the monovalent antibody of the
   invention is a monovalent form of adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab.
           In a further embodiment, the monovalent antibody binds to a target with a
20 dissociation constant  (kd)  of 10-7 M or less, such as 10-8 M or less, which target is
   selected   from   VEGF,     c-Met,   CD20,   CD38,   IL-8,  CD25,    CD74,    FcalphaRI,
   FcepsilonRI, acetyl choline receptor, fas, fasL, TRAIL, hepatitis virus, hepatitis C
   virus, envelope E2 of hepatitis C virus, tissue factor, a complex of tissue factor and
   Factor VII, EGFr, CD4, and CD28.
25         In one embodiment, an anti-VEGF monovalent antibody is used for treatment
   of AMD (acute macular degeneration), and other diseases.
           In one embodiment,         the anti-VEGF    monovalent antibody used is          a
   monovalent form of bevacizumab (Avastin).
           In an even further embodiment, the monovalent antibody is a human IgG4
30 antibody and which binds to c-Met with a dissociation constant    (kd) of 10-7 M or less,
   such as 10-8 M or less.'
           In one embodiment, a monovalent antibody of the invention is incapable of
   effector binding. The expression "incapable of effector binding" or "inability of effector
   binding" in the present context means that a monovalent antibody of the invention is
35 incapable of binding to the Clq component of the first component of complement
   (Cl) and therefore is unable of activating the classical pathway of complement
   mediated cytotoxicity. In addition, the monovalent antibodies of the invention are

                                                  27
   unable to interact with Fc receptors and may therefore be unable to trigger Fc
   receptor-mediated effector functions such as phagocytosis, cell activation, induction
   of cytokine release
           In one embodiment, a monovalent antibody of the invention is produced by
 5 use of recombinant       DNA technologies. Antibodies may be              produced using
   recombinant eukaryotic host cells, such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, NS/0
   cells, HEK293 cells, insect cells, plant cells, or fungi, including yeast cells. Both
   stable as well as transient systems may be used for this purpose. Transfection may
   be done using plasmid expression vectors by a number of established methods, such
10 as electroporation, lipofection or nucleofection. Alternatively, infection may be used to
   express proteins encoded by recombinant viruses such as adeno, vaccinia or
   baculoviruses. Another method may be to use transgenic animals for production of
   antibodies.
           Thus, in a further main aspect, the invention relates to a nucleic acid
15 construct encoding the monovalent antibody of the invention as described herein. In
   one embodiment, said nucleic acid construct is an expression vector.
           Furthermore, the invention relates to a method of preparing a monovalent
   antibody according to the invention comprising culturing a host cell comprising a
   nucleic acid construct according to invention, so that the monovalent antibody is
20 produced, and recovering the said monovalent antibody from the cell culture.
           A DNA sequence encoding the antibody may be prepared synthetically by
   established standard methods. The DNA sequence may then be inserted into a
   recombinant expression vector, which may be any vector, which may conveniently be
   subjected to recombinant DNA procedures. The choice of vector will often depend on
25 the host cell into which it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an
   autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector that exists as an extrachromosomal
   entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, for
   instance a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into
   a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome and replicated together with the
30 chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. In the vector, a DNA sequence
   encoding the antibody should be operably connected to a suitable promoter
   sequence. The coding DNA sequence may also be operably connected to a suitable
   terminator and the vector may further comprise elements such as polyadenylation
   signals (for instance from SV40 or the adenovirus 5 Elb region), transcriptional
35 enhancer sequences (for instance the SV40 enhancer) and translational enhancer
   sequences (for instance the ones encoding adenovirus VA RNAs). Other such
   signals and enhancers are known in the art.

                                                  28
            To obtain recombinant monovalent antibodies of the invention, the DNA
   sequences encoding different parts of the polypeptide chain(s) of the antibody may
   be individually expressed in a host cell, or may be fused, giving a DNA construct
   encoding the fusion polypeptide, such as a polypeptide comprising both light and
 5 heavy chains, inserted into a recombinant expression vector, and expressed in host
   cells.
            Thus, in a further aspect, the invention relates to a host cell comprising a
   nucleic acid according to the invention.
            The invention also relate to a non-human transgenic animal comprising a
10 nucleic acid construct according to the invention.
            The host cell into which the expression vector may be introduced, may be any
   cell which is capable of expression of full-length proteins, and may for instance be a
   prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell, such as yeast, insect or mammalian cells. Examples of
   suitable mammalian cell lines are the HEK293 (ATCC CRL-1573), COS (ATCC CRL
15 1650), BHK (ATCC CRL-1632, ATCC CCL-10), NS/0 (ECACC 85110503) or CHO
   (ATCC CCL-61) cell lines. Other suitable cell lines are known in the art. In one
   embodiment, the expression system is a mammalian expression system, such as a
   mammalian cell expression system comprising various clonal variations of HEK293
   cells.
20          Methods of transfecting mammalian cells and expressing DNA sequences
   introduced in the cells are well known in the art. To obtain a monovalent antibody of
   the invention, host cells of the expression system may in one embodiment to be
   cotransfected with two expression vectors simultaneously, wherein first of said two
   expression vectors comprises a DNA sequence encoding the heavy chain of the
25 antibody, and second of said two expression vectors comprises a DNA sequence
   encoding the light chain of the antibody. The two sequences may also be present on
   the same expression vector, or they may be fused giving a DNA construct encoding
   the fusion polypeptide, such as a polypeptide comprising both light and heavy chains.
            The recombinantly produced monovalent antibody may then be recovered
30 from the culture medium by conventional procedures including separating the host
   cells from the medium by centrifugation or filtration, precipitating the proteinaceous
   components of the supernatant or filtrate by means of a salt, for instance ammonium
   sulphate, purification by a variety of chromatographic procedures, for instance HPLC,
   ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, Protein A chromatography,
35 Protein G chromatography, or the like.
            The present invention also relates to a method of preparing a monovalent
   antibody of the invention, wherein said method comprises the steps of:

                                                     29
           (a)    culturing a host cell comprising          a nucleic acid encoding     said
                  monovalent antibody; and
           (b)    recovering the monovalent antibody from the host cell culture.
            In one embodiment, said host cell is a prokaryotic host cell. In one
 5 embodiment, the host cell is an E. coli cell. In one embodiment, the E. coli cells are of
   a strain deficient in endogenous protease activities.
            In one embodiment, said host cell is a eukaryotic cell. In one embodiment, the
   host cell is a HEK-293F cell. In another embodiment, the host cell is a CHO cell.
            In one embodiment, the monovalent antibody is recovered from culture
10 medium. In another embodiment, the monovalent antibody is recovered from cell
   lysate.
            In a further main aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical
   composition comprising the monovalent antibody according to the invention. In one
   embodiment, the composition further comprises one or more further therapeutic
15 agents described herein.
           The pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated with pharmaceutically
   acceptable carriers or diluents as well as any other known adjuvants and excipients
   in accordance with conventional techniques such as those disclosed in Remington:
   The Science and Practice of Pharmacy,       1 91h Edition, Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing
20 Co., Easton, PA, 1995. As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier"
   includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal
   agents, isotonicity agents, antioxidants and absorption delaying agents, and the like
   that are physiologically compatible.
           The pharmaceutical composition may be administered by any suitable route
25 and mode. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the route and/or mode of
   administration will vary depending upon the desired results.
            In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is suitable for parenteral
   administration.    The     phrase   "parenteral     administration"   means  modes      of
   administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and
30 includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal,
   intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal,
   subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal,
   epidural    and   intrasternal  injection  and     infusion.  In   one  embodiment    the
   pharmaceutical     composition is administered         by intravenous or subcutaneous
35 injection or infusion.
           Regardless of the route of administration selected, the monovalent antibodies
   of the present invention, which may be used in the form of a pharmaceutically

                                                   30
   acceptable salt or in a suitable          hydrated form,    and/or the pharmaceutical
   compositions of the present          invention, are formulated    into pharmaceutically
   acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.
            Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (for
 5 instance a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered,
   several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be
   proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic
   situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in
   dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit
10 form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for
   the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of monovalent
   antibody calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the
   required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the
   invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of
15 the monovalent antibody and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b)
   the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such a monovalent antibody for the
   treatment of sensitivity in individuals.
           Actual dosage levels of the monovalent antibodies in the pharmaceutical
   compositions of the present invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the
20 active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a
   particular patient, composition, and mode of administration. The selected dosage
   level will depend upon a variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of
   the particular monovalent antibodies of the present invention employed, the route of
   administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular
25 monovalent antibody being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs,
   compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compositions
   employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of
   the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.
           A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily
30 determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition
   required. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the
   compounds of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels
   lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and
   gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. In general, a
35 suitable dose of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention will be that amount of
   the monovalent antibody which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic
   effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described

                                                   31
   above. As another example, the physician or veterinarian may start with a high
   loading dose followed by repeated administration of lower doses to rapidly build up a
   therapeutically effective dose and maintain it over longer periods of time.
            A pharmaceutical composition of the invention may contain one or a
 5 combination of different monovalent antibodies of the invention. Thus, in a further
   embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions include a combination of multiple (for
   instance two or more) monovalent antibodies of the invention which act by different
   mechanisms. The monovalent antibodies may also be thus combined with divalent
   antibodies.
10          The monovalent antibody of the present invention have numerous in vitro and
   in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic utilities involving the diagnosis and treatment of
   disorders involving cells expressing the antigen which the antibody can recognize
   and bind to. In certain pathological conditions, it is necessary and/or desirable to
   utilize monovalent antibodies. Also, in some instances, it is preferred that a
15 therapeutic antibody effects its therapeutic action without involving immune system
   mediated activities, such as the effector functions, ADCC, phagocytosis and CDC. In
   such situations, it is desirable to generate forms of antibodies in which such activities
   are substantially reduced or eliminated. It is also advantageous if the antibody is of a
   form that can be made efficiently and with high yield. The present invention provides
20 such antibodies, which may be used for a variety of purposes, for example as
   therapeutics, prophylactics and diagnostics.
            In one embodiment, a monovalent antibody of the invention is directed to
   CD74 and inhibits MIF-induced signaling, but lacks Fc-mediated effector functions.
            In one embodiment, a monovalent antibody of the invention may prevent
25 binding of a virus or other pathogen to its receptor, such as inhibition of HIV binding
   to CD4 or coreceptor such as CCR5 or CXCR4.
            The scientific literature is abundant with examples of targets, where the
   binding of antibodies against said target, or specific epitopes of said target, is shown
   to have, or is expected to have, a therapeutic effect. Given the teaching of this
30 specification and as described elsewhere herein, it is within the skill of a person
   skilled in the art to determine, whether the use of a monovalent antibody, such as a
   monovalent antibody of the present invention, against such targets would be
   expected to produce the therapeutic effect.
            Accordingly, in a further aspect, the invention relates to the monovalent
35 antibody according to the invention as described herein for use as a medicament.
            In another aspect, the invention relates to the monovalent antibody according
   to the invention for use in the treatment of cancer.

10 disorder is treatable by administration of an antibody against a certain target, wherein
   the involvement of immune system-mediated activities is not necessary or is
   undesirable for achieving the effects of the administration of the antibody, and
   wherein said antibody specifically binds said antigen.
            In a further aspect, the invention relates to the monovalent antibody according
15 to the invention for use in the treatment of a disease or disorder, which disease or
   disorder is      treatable by    blocking  or inhibiting   a soluble antigen,    wherein
   multimerization of said antigen may form undesirable immune complexes, and
   wherein said antibody specifically binds said antigen.
            In a further aspect, the invention relates to the monovalent antibody according
20 to the invention for use in the treatment of a disease or disorder, which disease or
   disorder is treatable by blocking or inhibiting a cell membrane bound receptor,
   wherein said receptor may be activated by dimerization of said receptor, and wherein
   said antibody specifically binds said receptor.
            In one embodiment of any of the above treatments, the treatment comprises
25 administering one or more further therapeutic agents.
           Similarly, the invention relates to the use of the monovalent antibody
   according to the invention as described herein as a medicament.
           The invention also relates to a method of treating a disease or disorder as
   defined herein, wherein said method comprises administering to a subject in need of
30 such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a monovalent antibody
   according the invention, a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention or a

   comprises administering one or more further therapeutic agents.
            Furthermore, the invention relates to the use of the monovalent antibody
35 according to the invention in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a
   disease or disorder as defined herein.

                                                   33

   internalized    by  the cell,   resulting in   increased    therapeutic   efficacy of the
   immunoconjugate in killing the target cell to which it binds. In one embodiment, the
   cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with nucleic acid in the target cell.
            Examples of such cytotoxic agents include any of the chemotherapeutic
 5 agents noted herein (such as a maytansinoid or a calicheamicin), a radioactive
   isotope, or a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease.
            Monovalent antibodies of the invention may be used either alone or in
   combination with other compositions in a therapy. For instance, a monovalent
   antibody of the invention may be co-administered with one or more other antibodies,
10 such     as   monovalent    antibodies   of  the    present   invention,    one   or more
   chemotherapeutic agent(s) (including cocktails of chemotherapeutic agents), one or
   more other cytotoxic agent(s), one or more anti-angiogenic agent(s), one or more
   cytokines, one or more growth inhibitory agent(s), one or more anti-inflammatory
   agent(s), one or more disease modifying antirheumatic drug(s) (DMARD), or one or
15 more immunosuppressive agent(s), depending on the disease or condition to be
   treated. Where a monovalent antibody of the invention inhibits tumor growth, it may
   be particularly desirable to combine it with one or more other therapeutic agent(s)
   which also inhibits tumor growth. For instance, anti-VEGF antibodies blocking VEGF
   activities may be combined with anti-ErbB antibodies (for instance Trastuzumab
20 (Herceptin), an anti-HER2 antibody) in a treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
   Alternatively, or additionally, the patient may receive combined radiation therapy (for
   instance external beam irradiation or therapy with a radioactive labeled agent, such
   as an      antibody).  Such   combined therapies       noted above include combined
   administration (where the two or more agents are included in the same or separate
25 formulations), and separate administration, in which case, administration of the
   antibody of the invention may occur prior to, and/or following, administration of the
   adjunct therapy or therapies.
            In one embodiment, the monovalent antibody of the invention is a monovalent
   form of trastuzumab, for treatment of Her2 positive cancer.
30          For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of a
   monovalent antibody of the invention (when used alone or in combination with other
   agents such as chemotherapeutic agents) will depend on the type of disease to be
   treated, the type of antibody, the severity and course of the disease, whether the
   monovalent antibody is administered for preventive, therapeutic or diagnostic
35 purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the
   antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The monovalent antibody

                                                37
   may be suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of
   treatments.
            Such dosages may be administered intermittently, for instance every week or
   every three weeks (for instance such that the patient receives from about two to
 5 about twenty, for instance about six doses of the monovalent antibody). An initial
   higher loading dose, followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An
   exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4
   mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg/kg of the monovalent
   antibody. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. In one embodiment, the
10 monovalent antibodies of the invention are administered in a weekly dosage of from
   50 mg to 4000 mg, for instance of from 250 mg to 2000 mg, such as for example
   300 mg, 500 mg, 700 mg, 1000 mg, 1500 mg or 2000 mg, for up to 8 times, such as
   from 4 to 6 times. The weekly dosage may be divided into two or three subdosages
   and administered over more than one day. For example, a dosage of 300 mg may be
15 administered over 2 days with 100 mg on day one (1), and 200 mg on day two (2). A
   dosage of 500 mg may be administered over 3 days with 100 mg on day one (1), 200
   mg on day two (2), and 200 mg on day three (3), and a dosage of 700 mg may be
   administered over 3 days with 100 mg on day 1 (one), 300 mg on day 2 (two), and
   300 mg on day 3 (three).The regimen may be repeated one or more times as
20 necessary, for example, after 6 months or 12 months.
            The dosage may be determined or adjusted by measuring the amount of
   circulating monovalent antibodies of the invention upon administration in a biological
   sample for instance by using anti-idiotypic antibodies which target said monovalent
   antibodies.
25          In one embodiment, the monovalent antibodies of the invention may be
   administered by maintenance therapy, such as, for instance once a week for a period
   of 6 months or more.
            In one embodiment, the monovalent antibodies of the invention may be
   administered by a regimen including one infusion of a monovalent antibody of the
30 invention followed by an infusion of same monovalent antibody conjugated to a
   radioisotope. The regimen may be repeated, for instance 7 to 9 days later.
            In another main aspect, the invention relates to the use of a monovalent
   antibody according to the invention as a diagnostic agent.
35          As described above, in a further aspect, the invention relates to a stabilized
   IgG4 antibody for use as a medicament, comprising a heavy chain and a light chain,
   wherein said heavy chain comprises a human IgG4 constant region having the

                                                   38
   sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, wherein Lys (K) in position 250 has been
   replaced by Gin (Q) or Glu (E) and wherein the antibody optionally comprises one or
   more further substitutions, deletions and/or insertions in the constant region as set
   forth in SEQ ID NO:2.
 5          In one embodiment thereof, the human IgG4 constant region has the
   sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, wherein X1 at position 189 is Leu and X2 at
   position 289 is Arg. In another embodiment thereof, the human IgG4 constant region
   has the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, wherein X1 at position 189 is Leu and
   X2 at position 289 is Lys. In yet another embodiment thereof, the human IgG4
10 constant region has the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, wherein X1 at position
   189 is Val and X2 at position 289 is Arg.
            In one further aspect, the invention relates to an isolated stabilized IgG4
   antibody for use as a medicament, comprising a heavy chain and a light chain,
   wherein said heavy chain comprises a human IgG4 constant region having the
15 sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, wherein Lys (K) in position 250 has been
   replaced by GIn (Q) or Glu (E) and wherein the antibody optionally comprises one or
   more further substitutions, deletions and/or insertions in the constant region as set
   forth in SEQ ID NO:2.
            In one embodiment thereof, the human IgG4 constant region has the
20 sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, wherein X1 at position 189 is Leu and X2 at
   position 289 is Arg. In another embodiment thereof, the human IgG4 constant region
   has the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, wherein X1 at position 189 is Leu and
   X2 at position 289 is Lys. In yet another embodiment thereof, the human IgG4
   constant region has the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, wherein X1 at position
25 189 is Val and X2 at position 289 is Arg.
            The stabilized IgG4 antibodies according to the invention have the advantage
   that they contain a minimal number of sequence changes in the constant region as
   compared to naturally occurring IgG4. This reduces the risk of immunogenicity when
   the antibody is used for human therapy.
30          In one embodiment thereof the stabilized IgG4 antibody does not comprise a
   Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys sequence in the hinge region.
            In one embodiment thereof the CH3 region of the stabilized IgG4 antibody
   has been replaced by the CH3 region of human IgG1, of human IgG2 or of human
   IgG3.
35          In one embodiment thereof the stabilized IgG4 antibody does not comprise a
   substitution of the Leu (L) residue at the position corresponding to 115 by a Glu (E).

                                                   39
           In one embodiment thereof the stabilized IgG4 antibody does comprise a

   position 198, an Ala (A) at position 200, an Ala (A) or GIn (Q) at position 202.
           In one embodiment thereof the stabilized IgG4 antibody comprises a CXPC or
   CPXC sequence in the hinge region, wherein X can be any amino acid except for Pro
   (P).
10         In one embodiment thereof the stabilized IgG4 antibody does not comprise an
   extended IgG3-like hinge region, such as the extended hinge region as set forth in
   figure 14.
           In one embodiment thereof the stabilized IgG4 antibody comprises a CPSC
   sequence in the hinge region.
15         In one embodiment thereof the stabilized IgG4 antibody has less than 25,
   such as less than 10, e.g. less than 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2 substitutions, deletions
   and/or insertions in the constant region as set forth in SEQ ID NO:2.
           Typically, the stabilized IgG4 antibody of the invention has a lower ability to
   activate effector functions as compared to IgG1 and IgG3. In one embodiment
20 thereof the antibody is less efficient in mediating CDC and/or ADCC than a
   corresponding IgG1 or IgG3 antibody having the same variable regions. Assays for
   measuring CDC or ADCC activity are well known in the art.
           In one embodiment thereof the stabilized IgG4 antibody is selected from the
   group consisting of a human monoclonal antibody, a humanized monoclonal antibody
25 and a chimeric monoclonal antibody.
           In one embodiment thereof the stabilized IgG4 antibody comprises a human
   kappa light chain.
           In one embodiment thereof the stabilized IgG4 antibody comprises a human
   lambda light chain.

   for example an antibody which is bivalent even in the presence of excess of
   irrelevant antibodies, as explained in the Examples herein.
           In one embodiment thereof the stabilized IgG4 antibody is a full-length
   antibody.
35         Methods for the production of stabilized IgG4 antibodies are well-known in the
   art. In a preferred embodiment, antibodies of the invention are monoclonal
   antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies may e.g. be produced by the hybridoma method

                                                 40
   first described by Kohler et al., Nature 256, 495 (1975), or may be produced by
   recombinant DNA methods. Monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage
   antibody libraries using the techniques described in, for example, Clackson et al.,
   Nature 352, 624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222, 581-597 (1991).
 5 Monoclonal antibodies may be obtained from any suitable source. Thus, for example,
   monoclonal antibodies may be obtained from hybridomas prepared from murine
   splenic B cells obtained from mice immunized with an antigen of interest, for instance
   in form of cells expressing the antigen on the surface, or a nucleic acid encoding an
   antigen of interest. Monoclonal antibodies may also be obtained from hybridomas
10 derived from antibody-expressing cells of immunized           humans or non-human
   mammals such as rats, dogs, primates, etc.
            Further modifications, such as amino acid substitutions, deletions or insertion
   as described above, may be performed using standard recombinant DNA techniques
   well-known in the art.

   embodiments (i) to (xxxxiii).
            The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples which
   should not be construed as further limiting.
   EXAMPLES
15 EXAMPLE 1
   Structural analysis of CH3-CH3 interface
            In human IgG1, the non-covalent interaction between the CH3 domains
   involves 16 residues located on four anti-parallel p-strands that make intermolecular
   contacts and burry 1090 A2 from each surface (Deisenhofer, J.; Biochemistry, 1981.
20 20(9): p. 2361-70). Alanine scanning mutagenesis showed that stabilization of the
    IgG1 CH3-CH3 interaction was largely mediated by 6 of these residues, including
   K409 (Dall'Acqua, W., et al.; Biochemistry, 1998. 37(26): p. 9266-73). To get a better
   understanding of the role of K409 in the IgG1 CH3-CH3 interaction, the 1.65 A 1L6X
   crystal structure (Idusogie, E.E., et al.; J Immunol, 2000. 164(8): p. 4178-84) was
25 studied in more detail using the Brugel modelling package (Delhaise, P., et al., J.
   Mol. Graph., 1984. 2(4): p. 103-106).
            In order to propose mutations that should lead to a desired stabilization (or
   destabilization) of IgG4, a quantitative structure-based scoring methodology was
   employed (Desmet, J., et al.,; Proteins, 2005. 58(1): p. 53-69). Briefly, each position
30 in the CH3-CH3 dimer interface was subjected to mutagenesis to all natural amino
   acids, except cysteine and proline. Subsequent to mutagenesis, Exploration of the
   conformational space was obtained by interdependent optimization of the side chains
   of all residues located in a sphere of 12 A of the mutated residue, using the FASTER
   algorithm (Desmet, J., et al.,; Proteins, 2002. 48(1): p. 31-43), performed on all
35 macro-rotameric states for the side chain under investigation. Subsequently, on each
   macro-rotameric state thus obtained, a scoring function for the side chain under

                                                  48
   investigation was evaluated, as described (Desmet, J., et al.,; Proteins, 2005. 58(1):
   p. 53-69). Finally, per position in the CH3-CH3 dimer interface, the highest scores for
   each mutation were compared, and visual inspection of the resulting conformation
   was carried out in selected cases.
 5
   EXAMPLE 2
   Water hypothesis
           In the IgG1 structure, K409 forms a hydrogen bond with D399' on the
   opposite CH3 domain. Furthermore, K409 is part of a water-binding pocket together
10 with S364 and T411 in the same CH3 domain and K370' on the opposite CH3
   domain. The presence of the water molecule prevents an electrostatic clash between
   K409 and K370'.
           The K409R substitution (as in IgG4) was modelled in the 1L6X structure by
   optimizing the side chain conformations of the arginine residue and its surrounding
15 residues, using the FASTER algorithm (Desmet, J., et al.,; Proteins, 2002. 48(1): p.
   31-43). In this model, the guanidinium group of R409 takes up the position of the
   water molecule and causes an electrostatic clash with K370'. The side-chains of
   T41 1 and K370' loose their interactions compared to the case with water present (as
   in IgG1), but D399 keeps its interaction with the side chain at position R409.

    Destabilization of IqG4
           The mutations in the Table below were made in order to destabilize the CH3
   CH3 interaction of an IgG4.

   EXAMPLE 4
   Various technical procedures
   The following      techniques were       performed   as described    in W02007059782:
 5 Oligonucleotide primers and PCR amplification, agarose gel electrophoresis, analysis
   and purification of PCR products and enzymatic digestion products, quantification of
   DNA by UV spectroscopy, restriction enzyme digestions, ligation of DNA fragments,
   transformation of E. coli, screening of bacterial colonies by PCR, plasmid DNA
   isolation from E. coli culture, site-directed mutagenesis, DNA sequencing and
10 transient expression in HEK-293F cells.
   EXAMPLE 5
   Constructions and biochemical analysis of CH3 variants of 2F8-HG
            The above-described mutations were introduced into the CH3 region of
15 hingeless anti-EGFR antibody 2F8-HG, described in W02007059782. To make the
   constructs for the expression of the CH3 mutants, the mutations were introduced into
   pTomG42F8HG (described in W02007059782) using site-directed mutagenesis. The
   constructs were expressed transiently and purified as described in W02007059782.
            In order to investigate whether CH3 variant HG molecules exist as monomers
20 or dimers,     a mass      spectrometry     method    was   employed     as described  in
   W02007059782.
            Figure 1 shows a summary of the monomer/dimer ratios obtained for each
   HG mutant using non-covalent nano-electrospray mass spectrometry. CH3 mutants
   showed a substantial increase in monomer/dimer ratio compared to 2F8-HG (WT).
25 The percentage molecules present as monomers increased from 15 % in 2F8-HG
   (WT) to >80% in most CH3 mutants, except for mutation R277A. HG mutation
   R277K, which introduces an IgG1 sequence into the IgG4 backbone, was used as
   negative control. As expected, this mutant behaved as dimer.
            The monomer or dimer configuration of CH3 mutants was verified using
30 NativePAGETM         Novex@     Bis-Tris   gel   electrophoresis  (Invitrogen,  Carlsbad,
   California) according to the instructions of the manufacturer as shown in figure 2.
   This native gel electrophoresis technique uses Coomassie G-250 as a charge-shift

                                                 51
   molecule instead of SDS and is able to maintain native protein conformation and
   protein complex quaternary structures (Schagger H and von Jagow G 1991 Blue
   native gel electrophoresis for isolation of membrane complexes in enzymatically
   active form. Anal. Biochem. 199:223-244).
 5           Under these experimental conditions, 2F8-HG (WT) and R277K and R277A
   showed a protein band corresponding to the size of a full tetrameric (two heavy and
   two light chains) molecule. The CH3 mutants T234A, L236A, L236V, F273A, F273L,
   and Y275A were shown to be half molecules (only one heavy and one light chain).
10 EXAMPLE 6
   Functional analysis of CH3 mutants of 2F8-HG
            Binding of 2F8-HG (WT) and variants was determined in the absence and
   presence of 200 pg/ml polyclonal human IgG (Intravenous Immunoglobulin, IVIG,
   Sanquin Netherlands) (as described in Example 57 of W02007059782).
15           Figures 3 and 4 show that the binding curve of 2F8-HG in the presence of
   IVIG clearly right-shifts with respect to the binding curve of 2F8-HG without IVIG.
   This difference in avidity for the EGFr coat is consistent with the idea that, in the
   presence of IVIG, 2F8-HG binds monovalently (see Example 57 of W02007059782).
   The binding curves of several of the tested mutations, 2F8-HG-T234A, 2F8-HG
20 L236V, 2F8-HG-L236A and 2F8-HG-Y275A, become insensitive to the addition of
   IVIG and were super-imposable on the monovalent binding curve of 2F8-HG in the
   presence of IVIG. These differences in avidity for the EGFr coat are consistent with
   the idea that the 2F8-HG-T234A, 2F8-HG-L236V, 2F8-HG-L236A and 2F8-HG
   Y275A mutations prevent dimerization of the HG molecules.
25
   EXAMPLE 7
   Functional analysis of CH3 mutants of 2F8-HG
            CH3 mutants of 2F8-HG were shown to bind EGFr with lower apparent
   affinities than 2F8-HG in a binding ELISA coated with EGFr protein (see above). The
30 potency of 2F8-HG CH3 mutants to inhibit ligand-induced EGFr phosphorylation in
   cells in vitro was compared to that of 2F8-HG (WT) and 2F8-Fab fragments in the
   Phosphorylation      Inhibition Assay   (PIA)  as   described  in  example    54    of
   W02007059782.
            CH3 HG mutants were less potent to inhibit EGFr phosphorylation than 2F8
35 HG (WT) and the control mutants R277K and R277A, in line with the increase in
   monomer/dimer ratio of these mutants (figure 5).

                                                     52
   EXAMPLE 8
   Concentration dependent configuration of CH3 mutants of HG
           The monomer/dimer configuration of CH3 mutants F273A, L236V, and Y275A
   was further investigated at different concentrations, ranging from 0.01-10 pM using
 5 non-covalent nano-electrospray mass spectrometry as described in W02007059782.
   The monomer/dimer configuration of these CH3 mutants was compared to the
   configuration of 2F8-HG (WT) and R277K.
            Figure 6 shows that all HG mutants were               100% monomeric at low
   concentrations (except for R277K which behaved as dimer). With increased
10 concentration of HG mutants, a decrease in monomericity was observed. However,
   the figure shows that the CH3 mutants exhibited such decrease in monomericity at
   much higher concentration than 2F8-HG (WT). Hence, the CH3 mutants contained a
   higher percentage of monomer molecules at higher molar concentrations.
            For 2F8-HG (WT) and mutants E225A, E225V, S232R, T234A, L236A,

   F273L, F273Y, F273D, F273T, F273R, F273Q, Y275A, Y275Q, Y275K, Y275E,
   R277A, R277K, D267S+Y275E, D267S+Y275K, D267S+Y275Q, F273D+Y275E and
   F273T+Y275E signals corresponding to the monomeric (M,) and dimeric (D,)
   configurations were integrated and the relative proportion of each configuration at
20 each concentration ([M]o) was determined using the following equations:
           [M]eq = Ms/ (Ms + Ds).[M]o ; concentration monomer at equilibrium
           [D]eq = ([M]O - [M]eq) / 2; concentration dimer at equilibrium
            Dissociation constant (KD) values were subsequently calculated for all
   mutants by plotting the [D]eq against [M]eq2 values of each concentration and
25 determining the gradient by least-squares linear regression using Excell software
   (Microsoft). The   KD   measured for 2F8-HG (WT) was 5.0 x 10-8 M. The relative  KD   of
   each mutant compared to the        KD of 2F8-HG (WT) was calculated and plotted.
            Figure 7 shows that all HG mutants (except for R277K, K238A and K238T)
   had a higher relative KD, which translates into an increase in monomeric behavior
30 compared to 2F8-HG (WT). The R277K, K238A and K238T mutants showed a lower
   relative KD, meaning that they stabilize the CH3-CH3 interaction.
   EXAMPLE 9
   Removal of glycosylation sites
35         To remove (potential) acceptor sites for N-linked glycosylation ("glycosylation
   sites") from the monovalent antibody, alterations to the sequence were made. To
   examine how this could be achieved with introducing a minimum of T cell epitopes,

                                                   53
   and without perturbing the native structure of the molecule, an in silico analysis was
   performed. The HLA binding specificities of all possible 10-mer peptides derived from
   a target sequence were analyzed (Desmet et al. 1992, 1997, 2002, 2005; Van Walle
   et al. 2007 Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy 7:405-418). Profiling was done at
 5 the allotype level for 20 DRB1, 7 DRB3/4/5, 14 DQ and 7 DP, i.e. 48 HLA class ||
   receptors in total. Quantitative estimates of the free energy of binding deltaGbind of a
   peptide for each of the 48 HLA class || receptors were calculated. These data were
   then further processed by classifying peptides as strong, medium, weak and non
   binders.
10         The table below shows the 27 sequence variants which contain only medium
   epitopes, specific for no more than three different DRB1 allotypes.

    Table: Summary of sequence variants containing either a single medium DRB1
   epitope, or multiple medium epitopes affecting three or less MHC allotypes. The first
   column contains the specific sequence, the second column the number of medium
   DRB1 binding epitopes present in the sequence fragment, and the subsequent
 5 columns describe the specificity of these epitopes. Allotypes for which no epitopes
    were found in any of these sequence fragments were not included in the table.
           The lowest epitope content found in the study was within sequence variants
   which bind with medium strength to two different DRB1 allotypes (GST, MST, CSE,
10  DSE, DSP, ESP, GSP, HSE, NSE, PSP and SSE). A negative selection for
   mutations that:
           -   substitute any positions to cysteine,
           -   change the final threonine to proline, or
           -   replace the initial asparagines residue by an aliphatic side chain,
15 lead to the selection of the following preferred candidates: GST, NSE, DSE, HSE and
   SSE.
           To make the constructs for the expression of deglycosylated 2F8-HG, the
   GST and NSE mutations as identified by the above-described analysis were
   introduced into pTomG42F8HG (described in WO 2007059782) using site-directed
20 mutagenesis. The constructs were expressed transiently and binding was determined
   in the absence and presence of polyclonal human IgG (Intravenous Immunoglobulin,
    IVIG, Sanquin Netherlands) (as described in Example 57 of WO 2007059782).
           Figure 8 shows that the binding curves of 2F8-HG-GST and 2F8-HG-NSE in
   the absence and presence of IVIG were identical to the binding curve of 2F8-HG in

                                                 55
   the absence and presence of IVIG, respectively. This is consistent with the
   hypothesis that deglycosylation does not effect the binding affinity of the HG
   molecules or sensitivity to IVIG.
 5 EXAMPLE 10
   Biochemical analysis of non-glycosylation mutants of 2F8-HG
            Absence of glycosylation in the glycosylation site mutants of 2F8-HG was
   confirmed using High pH Anion Exchange Chromatography - Pulse Amperometric
   Detection (HPAEC-PAD).
10          To investigate the monomeric or dimeric configuration of the mutated HG
   molecules, a specialized mass spectrometry method was employed to preserve non
   covalent interactions between molecules.
            HG mutant samples were prepared in aqueous 50 mM ammonium acetate
   solutions and introduced into an LC-T nano-electrospray ionization orthogonal time
15 of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK), operating in positive ion
   mode. Source pressure conditions in the LC-T mass spectrometer and nano
   electrospray voltages were optimized for optimal transmission, the pressure in the
   interface region was adjusted by reducing the pumping capacity of the rotary pump
   by closing the valve (Pirani Pressure 6.67e0 mbar).
20          Spraying conditions were as follows: needle voltage 1275 V, cone voltage
   200 V, and source temperature 80 C. Borosilicate glass capillaries (Kwik-FilTM,
   World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, FL) were used on a P-97 puller (Sutter
   Instrument Co., Novato, CA) to prepare the nano-electrospray needles. They were
   subsequently coated with a thin gold layer using an Edwards Scancoat six Pirani 501
25 sputter coater (Edwards High Vacuum International, Crawley, UK).
            Figure 9 shows a summary of the monomer/dimer ratios obtained for each
   HG mutant using non-covalent nano-electrospray mass spectrometry at 1 pM protein
   concentrations. In agreement with the observations described in Example 54 of
   W02007059782, the data indicate that in the absence of polyclonal human IgG, 2F8
30 HG may behave as a bivalent antibody.
            Under these experimental conditions, non-glycosylation mutants exhibited the
   same monomer/dimer ratio as 2F8-HG (WT).
   EXAMPLE 11
35 Functional analysis of non-qlycosylation mutants of 2F8-HG
            Non-glycosylation HG mutants 2F8-HG-GST, 2F8-HG-NSE, 2F8-HG-DSE,
   2F8-HG-HSE, and 2F8-HG-SSE were shown to bind EGFr with apparent affinities

                                                 56
   similar to 2F8-HG (WT) in a binding ELISA, using EGFr protein as coat (see above).
   The potency of non-glycosylation 2F8-HG mutants to inhibit ligand-induced EGFr
   phosphorylation in cells in vitro was compared to that of 2F8-HG (WT) and 2F8-Fab
   fragments in the Phosphorylation Inhibition Assay (PIA) as described in example 54
 5 of W02007059782. Figure 10 shows that the potency of non-glycosylation HG
   mutants to inhibit EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFr in vitro was similar to that of
   2F8-HG (WT).
   EXAMPLE 12
10 Pharmacokinetic evaluation of non-glycosylation mutants
           Pharmacokinetic characteristics of non-glycosylation mutant 2F8-HG-GST
   and 2F8-HG-NSE were analyzed in SCID mice supplemented with 0.1 mg 7D8-IgG1
   as internal control. Pharmacokinetic analysis is explained in detail in example 50 of
   W02007059782. Internal control 7D8-IgG1 exhibited an equal clearance rate in all
15 mice investigated and was comparable to the clearance rate of 2F8-IgG4.
           Figure 11 shows that absence of glycosylation of 2F8-HG did not affect
   plasma clearance.

20 Generation of IqG1 and IqG4 antibodies with hinge region and/or CH3 domain
   mutations
           To investigate the structural requirements for Fab arm exchange, five IgG1
   mutants were made: an IgG1 with an IgG4 core-hinge (IgG1-P228S) (corresponds to
   111 in SEQ ID NO:7), two CH3 domain swap mutants (IgG1-CH3(y4) and IgG1
25 P228S-CH3(y4)), one CH3 point mutant in which lysine present at position 409 of
   IgG1 (within the CH3 domain) (corresponds to 292 in SEQ ID NO:7) is replaced for
   arginine (IgG1-K409R), and one IgG1 with an IgG4 core hinge and K409R mutation
   (IgG1-P228S-K409R) (Figure 12). These mutants were made with either Bet v 1 or
   Fel d 1 specificity. Please see WO 2008/119353 (Genmab A(S), especially the
30 examples, for a further description of production of antibody mutants as well as the
   Bet v 1 and Fel d 1 specificities.
           Two IgG4 mutants were made: one CH3 point mutant in which arginine
   present at position 409 of IgG4 (within the CH3 domain) (corresponds to 289 in SEQ
   ID NO:2) is replaced for lysine (IgG4-R409K), and one CH3 swap mutant (IgG4
35 CH3(yl)) (Figure 12). These mutants were also made with either Bet v 1 or Fel d 1
   specificity.

                                                   57
           Site directed mutagenesis was used to introduce a P228S mutation in the
   hinge of IgG1 using pEE-G1-wt a Bet v 1 as a template. Quickchange site-directed
   mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create the pEE-G1-CPSC mutant. The
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mix consisted of 5 pl pEE-G1 a Betv1 DNA
 5 template (-35 ng), 1,5 pl mutagenic primer-forward (-150 ng), 1,5 pl mutagenic
   primer-reverse (-150 ng), 1 pl dNTP mix, 5 pl reaction buffer (10x), 36 pl H20 and
   finally 1 pl Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase. Then the mix was applied to the PCR: 30"
   950C,    30" 950C (denaturating), 1' 550C         (annealing) and   17 minutes 680C
   (elongating). This cycle was repeated 20 times.
10          DNA digesting and ligation was used to create CH3 domain swap mutant
   constructs IgG1-CH3(y4) and IgG1-P228S-CH3(y4). Digestion reactions to obtain
   CH3 domains and vectors without CH3 domains were as follows: -1500 ng DNA
   (pEE-G1-betvl, pEE-G1-CPSC and pEE-G4-betvl), 2 pl BSA, 2 pl Neb3 buffer, 1 pl
   Sall and H2 0 added to a volume of 20 pl. Incubation at 370C for 30'. DNA was
15 purified and eluted with 30 pl H2 0 before 1 pl SanDI and 3 pl universal buffer was
   added     and   incubated   at 370C    for 30'.   Fragments   were subjected    to gel
   electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels with ethidium bromide. Fragments were cut from
   the gel under ultraviolet light and dissolved using a DNA purification kit (Amersham).
   The pEE-G4-wt Sall/SanDI (which contained IgG4 CH3 domain) fragment was
20 ligated into pEE-G1-wt and pEE-G1-CPSC using following procedure: 1 pl template
   DNA (Sall/SanDI digested pEE-G1-wt and pEE-G1-CPSC), 5 pl Sall/SanDI insert, 4
   pl Ligate-it buffer, 9 pl H20 and 1 pl ligase in a total volume of 20 pl. Ligation was
   stopped after 5'.
            DNA digestion (using Apal and Hindil) and ligation was used to replace the
25 VH domain of the bet v 1 mutant antibodies with that of pEE-G4-a-feldl wt, following
   a similar procedure as above.
           Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce point mutations (K409R or
   R409K) into the pEE-y4 wt, pEE-yl and PEE-yl-P228S constructs. Site-directed
   mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis
30 Kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's
   instructions, with changes as indicated below to increase mutagenic efficiency. This
   method included the introduction of a silent extra Accl site to screen for successful
   mutagenesis. First, a prePCR mix was used containing 3 pl 1Ox pfu reaction buffer, 1
   pl dNTP mix (10 mM), 275 ng forward or reverse primer, 50 ng template DNA and
35 0.75 pl Pfu turbo hotstart polymerase. A prePCR was run using a GeneAmp PCR
   system 9700 (Applied Biosystems): initial denaturation at 940C for 5 min; 4 cycles of
   940C for 30 sec, 50     0C  for 1 min and 68   0C  for 14 min. 25 pl of forward primer

                                                      58
   containing prePCR mix was added to 25 pl of reverse primer containing prePCR mix.
   0.5 pl Pfu turbo hotstart was added and amplification was performed: denaturing at
   94  0C  for 1 min; 14 cycles of 94  0C   for 1 min, 50 0C  for 1 min and 68 C for 8 min; 12
   cycles of 94  0C  for 30 sec, 55 0C  for 1 min and 68   0C  for 8 min.
 5          PCR mixtures were stored at 40C until further processing. Next, PCR mixtures
   were incubated with 1 pl DpnI for 60 min at 370C and stored at 40C until further
   processing. 2 pl of the digested PCR products was transformed in One Shot DNH5a
   T1R competent E. coli cells (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands) according to the
   manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Next, cells were plated on Luria-Bertani (LB)
10 agar plates containing 50 pg/ml ampicillin. Plates were incubated for 16-18 hours at
   370C until bacterial colonies became evident. After screening by colony PCR and
   Accl digestion to check for successful mutagenesis, plasmid was isolated from the
   bacteria and the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To check if no
   unwanted extra mutations were introduced the whole HC coding region was
15 sequenced and did not contain any additional mutations.
             Recombinant antibodies from these constructs were transiently expressed in
   HEK 293 cells in 3 ml, 6-wells plates (NUNC) or in 125 or 250 erlenmeyers (Corning)
   with 293 Fectin (Invitrogen) as transfection reagent.
20 EXAMPLE 14
   Fab arm exchange of IqG1 and IqG4 hinge region or CH3 domain mutants
            Antibodies were mixed and subsequently incubated with reduced glutathione
   (GSH) to investigate the exchange of half molecules. GSH (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
   MO) was dissolved in water before use.
25          The exchange of half molecules was evaluated by incubating an antibody
   mixture consisting of Bet v 1 specific antibody (200 ng) and Fel d 1 specific antibody
   (200 ng) in PBS/Azide containing GSH (1 or 10 mM) at 370C. Total incubation
   volume was 50 pl. After 24 hours samples were drawn from the incubation mixture in
   PBS-AT (PBS supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween-20 and
30 0.05% (w/v) NaN 3). For samples containing 10 mM GSH an equimolar amount of
   iodine-acetamide, a strongly alkylating agent that inhibits the GSH activity, was
   added. Samples were stored at 40C for measuring of antigen binding and bispecific
   activity
            Levels of Bet v 1 binding antibodies were measured in the antigen binding
35 test. Samples were incubated with 0.75 mg of protein G Sepharose (Amersham
   Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) in 750 pl PBS-IAT (PBS-AT supplemented with 1
                                     12 5
   pg/ml IVIg) in the presence of        I-labeled Bet v 1 for 24h. Next, the Sepharose was

                                                  59
   washed with PBS-T (PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.05% (w/v) NaN 3 )
   and the amount of radioactivity bound relative to the amount of radioactivity added
   was measured. The concentration of Bet v 1 specific IgG was calculated using
   purified Bet v 1 specific antibodies as a standard (range 0-200 ng per test as
 5 determined by nephelometer).
           The concentration of bispecific IgG (i.e. Fel d 1-Bet v 1 cross-linking activity)
   was measured in the heterologous cross-linking assay. In this assay, a sample was
   incubated for 24h with 0.5 mg Sepharose-coupled cat extract, in which Fel d 1
   antigen is present, in a total volume of 300 pl in PBS-IAT. Subsequently, the
                                                                      12 5
10 Sepharose was washed with PBS-T and incubated for 24h with             I-labeled Bet v 1,
   after which the Sepharose was washed with PBS-T and the amount of radioactivity
   bound relative to the amount of radioactivity added was measured. The concentration
   of bispecific IgG (Fel d 1-Bet v 1) was calculated using the same calibration curve as
   used in the Bet v 1 binding test, which was obtained from purified Bet v 1 binding
15 IgG. Tests were performed using antibody-containing supernatants in FreeStyle 293
   expression medium, GIBCO/Invitrogen Corporation.
           The following antibody mixtures were used:
   -   Betv1-IgG1 wt with Feld1-IgG1 wt (indicated as IgG1 wt in Figure 13)
   -   Betv1-IgG1 P228S with Feldl-IgGl-P228S (IgGl-P228S in Figure 13)
20 -   Betv1-IgG4-CH3(yl) with Feld1-IgG4-CH3(yl) (IgG4-CH3(yl) in Figure 13)
   -   Betv1-IgG4-R409K with Feld1-IgG4-R409K (IgG4-R409K in Figure 13)
   -   Betv1-IgG1-CH3(y4) with Feld1-IgG1-CH3(y4) (IgG1-CH3(y4) in Figure 13)
   -   Betv1-IgG1-K409R with Feld1-IgG1-K409R (IgG1-K409R in Figure 13)
   -   Betv1-IgG4 wt with Feld1-IgG4 wt (IgG4 wt in Figure 13)
25 -   Betv1-IgG1-P228S-CH3(y4)        with  Feld 1-IgG1 -P228S-CH3(y4)       (IgG1-P228S
       CH3(y4) in Figure 13)
   -   Betvl-IgG1-P228S-K409R with Feld1 -IgG1 -P228S-K409R (IgG1-P228S-K409R
       in Figure 13)
           The results (Figure 13) showed that at 1 mM GSH, half molecule exchange
30 occurs between IgG4 wt, IgGl-P228S-K409R or IgG1-P228S-CH3(y4) antibodies.
   Under these conditions, IgG1 wt, IgGl-P228S, IgG4-CH3(yl), IgG4-R409K, IgG1
   CH3(y4) or IgG1-K409R antibodies showed no or only minimal exchange of half
   molecules. At 10 mM GSH, half molecule exchange was also seen in the reactions
   containing IgG1-CH3(y4) or IgG1-K409R antibodies.

 5 be inhibited by using HG IgG4 molecules in the presence of an excess of irrelevant
   antibodies. WO/2007/059782 describes a hingeless IgG4 anti-EGFR antibody 2F8
    HG.
            Construction of pHG-2F8: A vector for the expression of the heavy chain of
   2F8-HG: The heavy chain cDNA encoding region of 2F8-HG was codon optimized
10 and cloned in the pEE6.4 vector (Lonza Biologics, Slough, UK). The resulting vector
   was named pHG-2F8.
            Construction of pKappa2F8: A vector for the production of the light chain of
   2F8 antibodies: The VL region encoding antibody 2F8 was codon optimized and
   cloned in the pKappa2F2 vector (a vector encoding the codon optimized cDNA
15 region of antibody 2F2 (described in W02004035607) in vector pEE12.4 (Lonza)),
   replacing the 2F2 VL region with the 2F8 VL region. The resulting vector was named
   pKappa-2F8.
            Hingeless   IgG4 anti-EGFR antibody 2F8-HG          has  been described      in
   WO/2007/059782. The additional mutations given in the Table below were introduced
20 into   the CH3     region  of hingeless    IgG4 antibody 2F8-HG        by site-directed
   mutagenesis.

           To make the constructs for the expression of the CH3 mutants, the mutations
   were introduced into pHG2F8 using site-directed mutagenesis.
           The    constructs   were  expressed    transiently   in  HEK-293F    cells  by
   cotransfecting the heavy-chain- and light-chain-encoding plasmids and binding to
 5 purified EGFr was determined in the absence and presence of 200 pg/ml polyclonal
   human IgG (Intravenous Immunoglobulin, IVIG, Sanquin Netherlands).
           Binding affinities were determined using an ELISA in which purified EGFr
   (Sigma, St Louis, MO) was coated to 96-well Microlon ELISA plates (Greiner,
   Germany), 50 ng/well. Plates were blocked with PBS supplemented with 0.05%
10 Tween 20 and 2% chicken serum. Subsequently, samples, serially diluted in a buffer
   containing 100 pg/ml polyclonal human IgG (Intravenous Immunoglobulin, IVIG,
   Sanquin Netherlands) were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature (RT).
   Plates were subsequently incubated with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit-anti-human
   kappa light chain (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) as detecting antibody and developed
15 with 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS; Roche, Mannheim,
   Germany). Absorbance was measured in a microplate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT)
   at 405 nm.
           Figure 14 shows that the binding curve of 2F8-HG in the presence of IVIG
   (thick dotted line with closed boxes) clearly right-shifts with respect to the binding
20 curve of 2F8-HG without IVIG (thick closed line with open boxes). This difference in
   avidity for the EGFr coat is consistent with the idea that, in the presence of IVIG,
   2F8-HG binds monovalently. The binding curves of the tested mutations, 2F8-HG
   F405L, 2F8-HG-F405A, 2F8-HG-R409A and 2F8-HG-R409KA, become insensitive to
   the addition of IVIG and were super-imposable on the bivalent binding curve of 2F8
25 HG in the absence of IVIG. These differences in avidity for the EGFr coat are
   consistent with the idea that the 2F8-HG-F405L, 2F8-HG-F405A, 2F8-HG-R409A
   and 2F8-HG-R409K mutations stabilize dimerization of the HG molecules.
   EXAMPLE 16
30 Additional CH3 domain mutations to stabilize dimerization of human IqG4 antibodies
           Following the analysis described in Examples 1 and 2, it was hypothesized
   that in human IgG4, mutations relieving the electrostatic strain between R409 and
   K370 (indicated with # in the table below) could possibly be used to stabilize IgG4
   and prevent Fab-arm exchange. Mutations were introduced into the CH3 domains of
35 IgG4-CD20 and IgG4-EGFr by site-directed mutagenesis.
           Mutations as given in the Table below were introduced into the CH3 domains
   of IgG4-CD20 and IgG4-EGFr by site-directed mutagenesis.

            Figure 16 shows that bispecific anti-EGFr/CD20 antibodies were formed in
   mixtures of IgG4 antibodies as well as in mixtures of CH3 domain mutants Q235R,
 5 E299Q, L325P, R289A and S244D. No bispecific activity was measured in mixtures
   of CH3 domain mutants R289K, R289M, R289L, K250E and K250Q, indicating that
   these mutations stabilized dimerization of human IgG4 antibodies. For CH3 domain
   mutants L231K, Y229D, F285A, F285L, R289W and E237T diminished bispecific
   activity was measured. The CH3 domain mutant T291V was unique in that it slowed
10 down the exchange reaction, but reached the same level of exchange as wild-type
   IgG4 after 24 hrs.

15          In order to investigate the CH3-CH3 interaction strength of IgG4, his-tagged
   constructs were designed based on the Fc-domains human IgG4 lacking the hinge
   region to prevent covalent inter-heavy chain disulfide bonds, his-CH2-CH3(G4).
   Subsequently, variants of these constructs containing mutations in the CH3-CH3
   interface listed below were generated by site-directed mutagenesis.

            The monomer/dimer configuration of the his-CH2-CH3(G4) and CH3 mutants
   was investigated at different concentrations, ranging from 0.01-10 pM using non
   covalent nano-electrospray mass spectrometry as described in W02007059782. For
 5 his-CH2-CH3(G4) and CH3 mutants signals corresponding to the monomeric (M,)
   and dimeric (D,) configurations were integrated and the relative proportion of each
   configuration at each concentration ([M]o) was determined as described in example 8.
            The  KD measured for his-CH2-CH3(G4) (WT) was 4.8 x 10-8 M. The relative
   KD  of each mutant compared to the    KD  of his-CH2-CH3(G4) (WT) was calculated and
10 plotted.
            Figure 17 shows that CH3 mutants K250E, K250Q, R289L, R289M and
   R289K had a lower relative KD, which translates into stabilization of the CH3-CH3
   interaction compared to his-CH2-CH3(G4) (WT). The S244D mutant had a KD.value,
   which was comparable to his-CH2-CH3(G4) (WT). The CH3 mutants Y229D, L231K,
15 E237T, F285A, F285L, R289A and R289W showed a higher relative KD, meaning an
   increase in monomeric behavior compared to his-CH2-CH3(G4) (WT).
            Figure 18 shows the correlation between the    KD values of the CH3 mutants in
   relation to the % of bispecific activity (after 24 hrs compared to WT IgG4). Mutants
   that are stabilized do not show bispecific activity, indicating that Fab-arm exchange
20 does not occur in these mutants. Mutants that have        KD  values comparable to WT
   IgG4 behave similar in the generation of bispecific antibodies. Figure 16 and figure
   18 together show that mutants that have a weaker CH3-CH3 interaction do form
   bispecific antibodies, but the amount of bispecific antibodies is much lower and are
   not stable over time.
