   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention relates to containers. In a typical application, an embodiment
   of the disclosure may be used to display and store food.
10 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Food sold in retail environments, such as a supermarket, is often presented for sale in
   transparent containers including a storage area (or base) and a lid. When purchasing
   food from a supermarket in such containers, it is important that a consumer can have
   confidence that the contents of the container has not been accessed by another
15 consumer or otherwise opened and contaminated or spoilt, whether accidentally or
   maliciously.
   One approach for protecting the contents of a food container from incidental or
   malicious tampering is to wrap the container with a protective film or wrap which
20 prevents removal of the lid from the storage area or base without first removing the
   film or wrap. However, such an approach involves additonal packaging operations
   and the use of additional packaging materials after the food has been placed in the
   container, which may add to the cost of the packaging process.
25 Another approach for protecting the contents of a food container from incidental
   opening is to attach a frangible seal, such as an adhesive strip or label,which joins the
   lid to the base and which must be broken to remove the lid from the storage area.
   However, such an approach also involves additonal packaging operations after the
   food has been placed in the container and may render opening the container more
30 difficult, or require a cutting tool, such as a knife or scissors.
   Yet another approach involves including a joining mechanism which joins the lid to
   the base in a way which impedes opening of the container. However, a potential
                                                  2

   problem with these types of arrangements is that it may not be evident from
   inspection whether the lid has been opened.
   It would be preferable to provide a container which provides a tamper protection
 5 mechanism which provides an indication to the consumer when the container has
   been tampered with or otherwise opened.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   According to a first aspect of the disclosure there is provided a container including:
10          a base;
            a lid attached to the base to close an opening in the base; and
            a frangible connection connecting the base to the lid;
            wherein the frangible connection includes at least one shaped line of weakness
   along which the connection is breakable for removal of the lid from the base.
15
   In embodiments, the shaped line of weakness provides a visible and/or tactile
   indication when the frangible connection is broken. The tactile and/or visible
   indication of breakage of the frangible connection may provide a consumer with an
   indication that the container has been opened and/or tampered with.
20
   In embodiments, the shaped line of weakness is formed to provide plural spaced apart
   projections or tabs when the connection is broken.
   In one embodiment, the spaced apart projections or tabs comprise a series of
25 corrugations extending along at least an extent of the shaped line of weakness.
   In another embodiment, the spaced apart projections or tabs comprise a series of
   serrations extending along at least an extent of the shaped line of weakness.
30 In yet another embodiment, the spaced apart projections or tabs form a rippled edge
   profile.
   In an embodiment, the lid is not normally removable from the base to open the
   container without breaking the frangible connection.
                                                 3

   In an embodiment, the at least one shaped line of weakness includes first and second
   lines of weaknesses and a tearable strip connects the first shaped line of weakness and
   the second shaped line of weaknesses. The tearable strip is removable to break the
   frangible connection. In such an embodiment, the or each shaped line of weakness
 5 may comprise a plurality of linkages with the tearable strip which are broken to
   remove the tearable strip and break the frangible connection
   The lid preferably includes a downwardly projecting lip extending about its periphery.
10 In embodiments, the downwardly projecting lip includes a bottom surface, an outer
   side wall and an inner side wall. The downwardly projecting lip may be shaped for
   cooperating with a correspondingly shaped portion of the upper rim portion to form
   the interlocking relationship therewith.
15 In embodiments, the correspondingly shaped portion of the base includes a ledge
   extending about an inner side wall of the base. In use, when the lid is depressed into
   the base, the bottom surface of the lip interfaces with the ledge of the base.
   The outer sidewall of the lip may be shaped to form, with a correspondingly shaped
20 sidewall of the upper rim portion, the interlocking relationship between the lid and the
   base. In an embodiment, the outer sidewall of the lip slants laterally outwardly as it
   depends downwardly so that when the lid is depressed into the upper rim portion, the
   interlocking relationship resists removal of the lid from the base.
25 According to another aspect of an embodiment there is provided a container
   including:
           a base having a rim portion defining an opening;
           a lid for forming an interlocking relationship with the rim portion to close the
   opening; and
30         a frangible connection connecting an edge of the rim portion with an edge of
   lid;
           wherein the frangible connection includes at least one shaped line of weakness
   along which the connection is breakable for removal of the lid from the opening, and
                                                4

   wherein the shaped line of weakness provides a visible and/or tactile indication when
   the connection is so broken.

   DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
25 Embodiments of the present invention are expected to find application with food
   containers and/or packaging.
   Figures 1 to 10 illustrate a container 100 according to an embodiment of the
   disclosure. The container has a base 102, a lid or cover 104 and a frangible connection
30 106. In the following description, the frangible connection 106 will be referred to as
   "the connection" 106.
   The container 100 shown here is a transparent disposable plastic container suitable for
   use, for example, for containing food stuffs for display and sale in a retail
                                               6

   environment, such as a supermarket. However, it is to be appreciated that containers
   according to embodiments of the disclosure are not limited to food containers.
   Indeed, it is envisaged that containers according to embodiments may be used for
   containing any item(s) for sale for which a consumer may require assurance that the
 5 contents of the container has not been tampered with, such as for example, items
   requiring a particular quantity.
   In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 1 to 10, the container 100 is manufactured
   from a single piece of a suitable material. One example of a suitable material is
10 Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET). Other suitable materials include Polylactide,
   Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), or other rigid polymers.
   With reference initially to Figure 1, the base 102 shown here includes an upper rim
   portion 108 forming an opening 110. As shown in Figures 5 and Figure 6, the upper
15 rim portion 108 includes a continuous ledge 200 depending about the opening 110. A
   raised lip 202 is located outwardly of the ledge 200.
   As shown is in more detail in Figure 10, the raised lip 202 includes an inner sidewall
   204 which slants laterally inwardly as it extends upwardly. The combination of the
20 slanted inner sidewall 204 and the ledge 200 form a region for receiving an opposed
   downwardly depending portion 206 (when the lid 104 is positioned to close the
   opening 110 as is shown in Figure 5) extending about a periphery of the lid 104, as
   will be explained in more detail below.
25 Before continuing, it is to be noted that Figure 10 shows the container 100 when the
   lid 104 is depressed into the base 106 (and thus when the lid 104 closes the opening)
   with the base 106 located on a surface considered as a horizontal reference surface.
   Where used in this specification, directional terms used are used to describe the
   container 100 and its components with respect to the orientation illustrated in Figure
30 10. Accordingly, in the orientation shown in Figure 10, the directional terms
   "inwardly" and "outwardly" and the like are used herein with respect to the described
   container 100 to refer to directions relative to the geometric centre of the container.
   Additionally, the terms "upper", "lower", "downwardly" and the like are used to
                                                7

   describe spatial relationships among structures when the lid 104 of the container 100
   is depressed into the base 102 in the orientation shown in Figure 10.
   Continuing now with reference to Figures 1 to 10, the lid 104 is configured to form an
 5 interlocking relationship with the upper rim portion 108 to close the opening 110
   when the lid 104 is depressed into the base 102. The lid 104 shown here includes a
   downwardly depending lip 206 including a lower surface, shown here as a lower flat
   portion 208, and an outer sidewall 210 which slants laterally outwardly as it depends
   downwardly. An outer lip 212 projects outwardly from an upper edge 213 of the
10 outer sidewall 210 to form an outer perimeter about the lid 104.
   Upwardly projecting lugs 130, 132, 134, 136 are provided on the lid 104 to assist with
   stacking containers 100. In the present case, stacking may involve vertically stacking
   two or more containers 100 such that a lower most or bottom perimeter of a supported
15 container 100 (that is, a top container of a pair of stacked containers) is located
   between a holding region formed by each of the upstanding plural lugs 130, 132, 134,
   136 of a supporting container (that is, a bottom container of a pair of stacked
   cntainers) to thereby restrict horizotnal translation of the supported container.
20 In use, when the lid 104 is depressed into the the base 102 to close the opening 110,
   the outer sidewall 210 of the lid 104 and the inner sidewall 204 of the base 110
   resiliently engage to thereby to thereby interlock the lid 104 with the outer rim portion
   108 of the base 102. As shown in Figure 9, when so interlocked, the outer lip 212 is
   seated on a shoulder 214 of the outer rim portion 108 so as to be recessed relative to
25 an upper face 216 of the raised lip 202.
   By depressing the lid 104 into the base 102 and engaging the downwardly depending
   lip 206 of the lid 104 into the upper rim portion 108 of the base 102 so that the outer
   lip 212 of the lid 104 is recessed relative to the upper face 216 of the raised lip 202,
30 the resultant interlocking engagement provides an arrangment in which it is not
   normally possible to grip the outer lip 212 of the lid 104 to remove the lid 104 from
   the base 102.
                                                 8

   In embodiments, once the lid 104 is depressed into the base 102 to close the opening
   110, the lid 104 is not normally removable from the base 102 to open the container
   100 without breaking the connection 106.
 5 Turning now to Figure 7, in embodiments the connection 106 flexibly connects an
   edge 112 of the upper rim portion 108 with an edge 114 of lid 104. In the present
   case, the connection 106 includes a shaped line of weaknesses 116 (refer to Figure 8)
   extending along a length extent of the connection 106.
10 As shown in Figures 9 and 10, once the lid 104 is depressed into the base 102 to close
   the opening 110, the connection 106 provides an edge profile 118 which extends
   along the length extent of the connection 106. As will be explained below, the
   connection 106 is frangible along at least one shaped line of weakness 116 to form a
   modified edge profile.
15
   In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 3, the shaped line of weakness 116 is formed
   to provide a linear arrangement of bends 117-1 and straight sections 117-2 extending
   across a length extent of the connection 106. The shaped line of weakness 116 shown
   here includes plural individually frangible interconnections 126 in a spaced apart
20 arrangement along the shaped line of weakness 116.
   In the embodiment illustrated, breaking the connection 106 along the shaped line of
   weakness 116 involves breaking each of the individually frangible interconnections
   126.
25
   Although in the present case the shaped line of weakness 116 includes a plurality of
   individually frangible interconnections 126, it is to be understood that in other
   embodiments a different arrangement may be used. For example, the shaped line of
   weakness 116 may include a weakened groove, a series of perforations, or a
30 fracturable bond, such as a fracturable adhesive.
   Before continuing further, although the illustrated embodiment includes a single
   shaped line of weakness 116, it is possible that containers according to other
   embodiments may include more than one shaped line of weakness. In this respect,
                                               9

   Figures 11 to 13 illustrate one example of an embodiment of a container 300
   including include a first 302 and a second 304 shaped line of weakness (shown as
   broken). The container 300 shown here is substantially the same as the container 100
   described above except that the connection 106 includes a tearable strip 306 which
 5 connects the first 302 shaped line of weakness and the second 304 shaped line of
   weaknesses. As shown in Figure 11, the tearable strip 306 may be removable to break
   the connection 106 and thereby modify the edge profile 118 so as to provide a visible
   and/or tactile indication, which in this example comprises a series of spaced apart
   tabs.
10
   Figures 15 to 18 illustrate another example of an embodiment of a container 400
   including include a first 402 and a second 404 shaped line of weakness (shown in
   Figures 15 to 17 as broken) and a tearable strip 406. The container 400 shown here is
   similar to the container 300 described above except that the tearable strip 406 which
15 connects the first 402 shaped line of weakness and the second 404 shaped line of
   weaknesses has a different configuration to tearable strip 306. As shown in Figure 18,
   in this embodiment the tearable strip 406 is removable by pulling tab 408 to break
   each of a plurality spaced apart of linkages thereby remove the tearable strip and
   break the frangible connection connection 106 and thereby modify the edge profile
20 118 so as to provide a visible and/or tactile indication, which in this example is
   provided by a series of serrations 410 formed upon removal of the tearable strip 406.
   Returning now to Figure 8, embodiments may include fold lines, shown here as
   perforated lines 122, 124, which allow the connection 106, and therefore the lid 104,
25 to move so that the lid 104 can be positioned to close the opening 110. It is not
   essential that fold lines 122, 124 be provided since in some embodiments the
   connection may be sufficiently flexible to allow the required movement of the lid 104.
   Nevertheless, it is preferred that fold lines be provided. In the present case,
   positioning the lid 104 to close the opening 110 causes the fold lines 122, 124 to
30 crease along their length, thus forming the edge profile 118.
   In embodiments, and as shown in Figure 17, when the lid 104 is in an interlocking
   relationship with the upper rim portion 108 to close the opening 110, modification of
   the edge profile 118 by breaking the connection 106 along the shaped line of
                                                10

   weakness 116 provides a tactile and/or visible indication of breakage of the
   connection 106. The tactile and/or visible indication of breakage of the connection
   106 may provide a consumer with an indication that the container 100 has been
   opened and/or tampered with.
 5
   In some embodiments, modification of the edge profile 118 by breaking the
   connection 106 involves modifying the edge profile 118 from a linear or straight edge
   profile to an edge profile comprising plural spaced apart tabs 120 having a geometry
   defined by the shaped line of weakness 116. In the embodiments shown in Figures 1
10 to 14, the modified edge profile includes a series of spaced apart projections or tabs
   500. However, it will be appreciated that other arrangements are possible, such as the
   arrangement illustrated and described with reference to Figures 15 to 18 comprising a
   series of serrations 410. In embodiments, the serrations 410 provide a visible and/or
   tactile indication that the frangible connection has been broken.
15
   Returning now to Figures 3 and 14, embodiments may include gripping taps 130, 132
   located adjacent to one or each end of the or each shaped line of weakness 116. In
   some embodiments, each pair 128 includes a first tab 130 located on the lid 104 and a
   second tab 132 located on the base 106. In use, a consumer may grip the tabs 130,
20 132 of either pair 128 of the gripping taps 130, 132 and pull the tabs 130, 132 apart to
   thereby exert a breaking force on the connection 106 sufficient to break the
   connection 106 along the shaped line of weakness 116. Once so broken, the lid 104
   may be removed from the base 102 to open the container 100.
25 In embodiments including a tearable strip, it is possible that a gripping tab may be
   provided on the or each end of the tearable strip so as to allow for the tearable strip to
   be gripped and pulled or "torn off' the container by a pulling force sufficient to
   remove the tearable strip and thereby break the connection along the shaped lines of
   weakness. In such embodiments, gripping taps 130, 132 need not be located on the
30 lid 104 and/or the base 106.
   Although a preferred embodiment has been described in the foregoing detailed
   description, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiment
   disclosed, but is capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications and substitutions
                                                11

  without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth and defined by the
  following claims.
  Throughout the specification and the claims that follow, unless the context requires
5 otherwise, the words "comprise" and "include" and variations such as "comprising"
  and "including" will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group
  of integers, but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.
