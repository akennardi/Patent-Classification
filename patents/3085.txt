                                      Background of the Invention
   1. Field of the Invention
                [0002]   Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to surgical
10 instruments and methods for the treatment of bones or joints, in some instances surgical
   instruments that are matched to a particular patient's anatomy, are described herein. Also
   described are methods of designing and using such surgical instruments.
   2. Related Art
15              [0003]   Conventional patient-matched instruments are provided with large surfaces
   that are configured to conform to a patient's unique anatomy. Successful surgical outcomes
   depend on the ability of patient-matched instruments to provide a reproducible, "confident"
   3D-fit between the patient-matched instrument and the anatomy that they are designed to rest
   against. If there is any doubt by an end user that a patient-matched instrument fits well upon
20 repeated engagement with a patient's unique anatomy, or if the instrument appears to fit well
   with the patient's anatomy in multiple spatial orientations with respect to the anatomy, the
   instrument is typically discarded, and the surgery is carried out with the use of conventional,
   non-patient specific instruments.
                [0004]   To date, at least some patient-matched surgical instruments for use in total
25 knee arthroplasty have employed anatomy-contacting surfaces that are substantially
                                                    -1

   WO 2014/026083                                                                PCT/US2013/054278
    "negatives" of distal femoral and proximal tibial articular joint surfaces. The anatomy
    contacting surfaces are generally large surface areas that conform in a continuous manner to
    substantial areas of a patient's anatomy. In some instances, the custom surgical instruments
    are provided by obtaining 3D image data of the patient's anatomy (e.g., via an MRI scan),
 5  segmenting the 3D         image data to clearly delineate surfaces         of the bony     and/or
    cartilegeneous anatomy from surrounding tissues, converting the segmented data to a
    computer model via CAD or other software, performing one or more optional secondary
    processes (e.g., smoothing functions), using a computer model to customize one or more
    surfaces of an instrument to the patient's anatomy, and manufacturing the custom instrument
10  such that it is adapted to conform to the patient's anatomy in a single spatial orientation.
         [0005]       In at least some current practices, substantially all portions of the joint
    anatomy shown in each 3D image data slice are segmented and conventional patient
    matched      instruments   are  provided    with   anatomy-contacting     portions  that  contact
    substantially continuous areas of the patient's anatomy. Such anatomy-contacting portions
15  have large continuous surface areas of contact with the patient's bone and cartilage, and
    therefore, it is critical that the engineers or automated programs creating the patient
    matched instruments maintain a high level of accuracy and precision throughout each step
    of the entire segmentation process. Even if only one or two points on anatomy-contacting
    surfaces of a patient-matched         instrument are    inaccurate,   misaligned, or otherwise
20  misrepresent the true unique anatomy of the patient, the patient-matched instrument may not
    fit well, sit proud, teeter, wobble, or may not fit at all. In such instances, an end user is less
    likely to use the instrument. In many cases, poor patient-matched instrument fit may be
    attributed to even a few minor errors in the segmentation process.

   WO 2014/026083                                                             PCT/US2013/054278
                              Detailed Description of the Embodiments
         [0024]     Referring to the accompanying drawings in which like reference numbers
    indicate like elements, Figure 1 illustrates a patient matched instrument that is designed to
    provide improved repeatability and reproducibility over the prior art. FIG. 1 illustrates a
 5  patient matched (PM) instrument 100 placed on a tibia 2. The patient matched instrument
    100 has a first paddle 110, a second paddle 112, a body 114, and a cutting slot 116. The
    paddles 110, 112 extend from the body 114 and are spaced apart from one another such that
    the paddles 110, 112 generally contact the medial 6 and lateral 8 tibial condyles. The body
    114 may include one or more fixation holes 118. In the depicted embodiment, the body has
10  three fixation holes but any number of holes may be used. The fixation holes 118 are
    dimensioned to receive pins (not shown) to temporarily fix the patient matched instrument
    100 to the tibia 2. The cutting slot 116 is dimensioned to receive a cutting instrument, such
    as a reciprocating blade (not shown). The body 114 has sufficient depth to provide adequate
    strength to the cutting slot 116 such that bending of the body and skiving of the cutting
15  instrument may be reduced. In some embodiments, the body 114 includes a groove 120 that
    may be used for gaging alignment.
         [0025]     In use, the tibia 2 is exposed via surgical incision. The patient matched
    cutting block 100 is placed on the tibia 2 and located in a home position. Pins (not shown)
    are inserted into the fixation holes 118. The cutting instrument is reciprocated in the cutting
20  slot 116 to remove bone from a proximal end of the tibia 2.
         [0026]     As best seen in FIG. 2, one of the paddles 110, 112 may be thinner or thicker
    than the other paddle. In the depicted embodiment, the medial paddle has a thickness of
    about 5 mm. The thickness of the paddles may range from about 2 mm to about 15 mm, and
    more preferably from about 3 mm to about 5 mm. It is beneficial to the consistent and
25  accurate placement of the PM instrument to minimize unintended potential contact with
                                                  -5 -

   WO 2014/026083                                                              PCT/US2013/054278
    anatomic structures. For instance, some PM tibia instruments utilize tall or thick proximal
    paddles with the intent of stiffening the instrument to resist deformation errors, however, the
    thicker paddles may actually lead to an inability to properly place the PM instrument due to
    unintended contact between the paddles and one or both femoral condyles. Also, an
 5  operator, in attempting to avoid this unintentional contact may alter his or her surgical
    technique in order to make all femur resections prior to placing the PM tibial instrument.
    This is a limiting disadvantage because in doing so excludes many techniques that rely on
    alternating resections on the femur and tibia for the purpose of making resections based on
    joint balance rather than strictly based on measured resection. By designing the proximal
10  paddles of the PM tibial instrument shorter and by limiting the posterior extent of the
    paddles, an operator is much more likely to place the instrument with greater accuracy as
    well as incorporate soft tissue balance techniques into his or her surgical technique. These
    benefits far outweigh the very small errors associated with deflection of the PM
    instrument's thinner paddles during placement.
15      [0027]      FIG. 3 illustrates an interior, patient matched surface of the body 130. The
    patient matched surface 130 contacts an anterior surface 10 of the tibia 2. In the depicted
    embodiment, the patient matched surface 130 is illustrated using a cross-hatch pattern. This
    is merely to highlight the area and does not indicate a texture or other surface modification;
    although, the patient matched area 130 could have a surface roughness different than that of
20  the body 114. In some embodiments, the patient matched surface 130 also contacts the
    anterior-proximal ridge of the tibia such that the patient matched surface contacts the tibia
    both superior and inferior of the cutting slot 116. This is significant as the dual contact
    provides greater repeatability and reproducibility. In addition to the patient matched surface
    130, each paddle 110,112 has a contact surface 132. The patient matched surface 130 and
25  the contact surfaces 132 are used to locate the cutting slot 116 relative to the tibia.

         [0028]    As best seen in Fig. 4, the cutting slot 116 may include a ledge 140. A user
    may place the cutting instrument on the ledge 140 and use it as a planar guide for cutting.
    The ledge 140 may extend beyond an exterior surface 142 of the body 114.
         [0029]    FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate a second embodiment of the patient matched
 5  instrument 200. In this second embodiment, the patient matched instrument 200 includes a
    built-in alignment checker 210. The built-in alignment checker has a receiver 212 and a
    bridge 214. The bridge 214 spaces the receiver 212 away from a body 216 of the patient
    matched instrument 200. A user places a drop rod (not shown) in the receiver 212 to
    physically check the alignment of a cutting slot 218 before making a cut. Due to the
10  material properties of some PM instruments, the shape of the bridge has a significant
    functional effect which can be advantageous. In the embodiment shown, the bridge is
    designed to rigidly constrain the alignment rod (not shown) to the PM instrument in the
    sagittal plane but to flexibly constrain in the coronal plane. The intent of this particular
    embodiment is to allow the operator to alter the sagittal alignment (posterior slope) of the
15  PM tibial instrument while greatly reducing the operator's unintentional alteration of the
    coronal alignment (varus/valgus) of the PM tibial instrument. It has been found that the
    coronal alignment of the PM block is more consistent than the sagittal alignment. By
    allowing users to more accurately alter the sagittal alignment with the use of the alignment
    rod one but minimizing the effect of the alignment rod on the coronal alignment, the bridge
20  shape preserves the inherent consistency of the PM instrument and allows operators to
    correct for any inconsistency in the sagittal plane. Other embodiments may also be
    beneficial to other users or with other PM instrument designs, such as a bridge which is
    shaped to constrain in both sagittal and coronal alignment or a bridge which is shaped to
    constrain coronal rather than sagittal alignment.

        [0030]      FIG. 7 illustrates a third embodiment of the patient matched instrument 300.
    In this third embodiment, the patient matched instrument 300 includes a quick connect
    handle 310. Any number of instruments may be connected to the quick connect handle3 10.
    For example, an alignment checker may be connected to the quick connect handle.
 5      [0031]      FIG. 8 illustrates an alignment checker guidance tab 400. The alignment
    checker guidance tab 400 includes a drop rod holder 410 and a quick connect handle 412.
    The drop rod holder 410 has one or more locations 414 to receive a drop rod (not shown).
    The alignment checker guidance tab 400 conveniently mates with the patient matched
    instrument 100 via the cutting slot 116. In some embodiments, the alignment checker
10  guidance tab 400 may include an indentation 416 such that a user can align the groove 120
    of the patient matched instrument 100 with the indentation 416 of the alignment checker
    guidance tab 400.
        [0032]      As best seen in FIG. 9, the patient matched instrument 100 may include a
    positive stop 150 for locating the alignment checker guidance tab 400. In the depicted
15  embodiment, the positive stop 150 is a hook-feature that engages a corner 420 of the
    alignment checker guidance tab 400. The alignment checker guidance tab 400 may include
    cantilevered tabs or flaps 430. The flaps 430 may engage the cutting slot 116. The flaps 430
    may act as a locking mechanism to temporarily lock the alignment checker guidance tab
    400 to the patient matched instrument 100 or they may simply frictionally engage the
20  cutting slot 116 to make movement less likely.

    with a patient matched instrument 100, 200, 300. The pin fixation holes 500 may be located
    both superior and inferior of the cutting slot 116, 218. In the depicted embodiment, four
    pins are used in four holes but any number of holes and/or pins may be used. Fixation above
25  and below the cutting guide has the effect of reducing resection error due to deformation of

         [0034]     FIG. 11 illustrates a patient matched instrument 500. The patient matched
    instrument 500 has a first paddle 510, a second paddle 512, a body 514, and a cutting slot
 5  516. The paddles 510, 512 extend from the body 514 and are spaced apart from one another
    such that the paddles 510, 512 generally contact the medial 6 and lateral 8 tibial condyles.
    The body 514 may include one or more fixation holes 518. In the depicted embodiment, the
    body has five fixation holes but any number of holes may be used. The fixation holes 518
    are dimensioned to receive pins (not shown) to temporarily fix the patient matched
10  instrument 500 to the tibia 2. The cutting slot 516 is dimensioned to receive a cutting
    instrument, such as a reciprocating blade (not shown). The body 514 has sufficient depth to
    provide adequate strength to the cutting slot 516 such that bending of the body and skiving
    of the cutting instrument may be reduced.
         [0035]     One of the paddles 510, 512 may be thinner or thicker than the other paddle.
15  In the depicted embodiment, both paddles have a thickness of about 4 mm. The thickness of
    the paddles may range from about 2 mm to about 15 mm, and more preferably from about 3
    mm to about 5 mm. Moreover, the paddles 510, 512 may be trimmed at different angles to
    achieve an overall desired height. The overall height of the paddles 510, 512 may be
    determined by an offset function relative to the proximal tibia bone surface. Paddles with a
20  sufficient minimum thickness may provide an advantage of allowing for tibial placement
    prior to making posterior femoral resections.
         [0036]     As best seen in FIG. 13, the body has an interior, patient matched surface
    530. The patient matched surface 530 contacts the anterior surface 10 of the tibia 2. In the
    depicted embodiment, the patient matched surface 530 is illustrated using a cross-hatch
25  pattern. This is merely to highlight the area and does not indicate a texture or other surface

    modification; although, the patient matched area 530 could have a surface roughness
    different than that of the remainder of the body 514. In some embodiments, the patient
    matched surface 530 also contacts the anterior-proximal ridge of the tibia such that the
    patient matched surface contacts the tibia both superior and inferior of the cutting slot 516.
 5  This is significant as the dual contact provides greater repeatability and reproducibility. In
    addition to the patient matched surface 530, each paddle 510,512 has a contact surface 532.
    The patient matched surface 530 and the contact surfaces 532 are used to locate the cutting
    slot 516 relative to the tibia 2.
         [0037]     FIG. 13 also illustrates an anterior-proximal-lateral tibia body contact portion
10  570 and an anterior medial contact portion 572.
         [0038]     The patient matched instrument 500 also includes a hook 550.The hook 550
    is adapted to contact a posterior surface of the tibia 2. The height and width of the hook 550
    may a set size for all patient matched instruments or may be sized based upon a particular
    patient's anatomy. Although the hook 550 is depicted as being upon the medial paddle, it
15  could also be formed as part of lateral paddle, or both paddles.
         [0039]     As best seen in FIG. 17, the patient matched instrument 500 includes an area
    560 wherein the body 514 is configured to contact a portion of the anterior of the tibia 2 and
    provides support for the cutting slot 516. The area 560 is matched to the particular patient's
    anatomy.
20       [0040]     In use, the tibia 2 is exposed via surgical incision. The patient matched
    cutting block 500 is placed on the tibia 2 and located in a home position. Pins (not shown)
    are inserted into the fixation holes 518. The cutting instrument is reciprocated in the cutting

   WO 2014/026083                                                             PCT/US2013/054278
    intersection of first member 610 and second member 612. The confidence point may be
    placed over the ACL attachment point or some other anatomical landmark. Confidence
    point 614 may be just a visual aid provided by the intersection of members 610, 612 or a
    hole location. For example, a pin (not shown) may be inserted into the confidence point
 5  614. A user, such as a surgeon, may view the anatomical landmark (e.g., ACL attachment)
    relative to the confidence point 614.
         [0042]      In some embodiments, in order to give a user more confidence in placing a
    patient matched instrument and/or to minimize the chance of false placement, the patient
    matched instrument may be provided with certain combined features that act in synergy to
10  enhance the patient matched instrument's fit, stability, and/or constraint. As examples, such
    features may be larger paddles, anterior medial contact, slot contact, and/or the posterior
    hook. The location, dimensions, and combinations of particular features may be worked into
    an algorithm based upon the patient's anatomy and/or user preference. For example, to
    improve varus/valgus constraint, the features may focus on constraint provided by the
15  medial and lateral paddles. Alternatively, to enhance flexion and extension, the features may
    focus on constraint provided by the hook and the body along the anterior portion.
    Otherwise, to enhance rotation, the features may focus on constraint provided by the slot
    contact and the anterior-proximal-lateral tibia body contact.
         [0043]      Any of the features of the embodiments disclosed herein may be combined in
20  various combinations to form alternative embodiments.
         [0044]      As various modifications could be made to the exemplary embodiments, as
    described above with reference to the corresponding illustrations, without departing from
    the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the foregoing
    description and shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative
25  rather than limiting. Thus, the breadth and scope of the invention should not be limited by

    principles of the invention and its practical application to thereby enable others skilled in the
    art to best utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are
    suited to the particular use contemplated.
         [0047]       As various modifications could be made in the constructions and methods
10  herein described and illustrated without departing from the scope of the invention, it is
    intended that all matter contained in the foregoing description or shown in the accompanying
    drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative rather than limiting. For example, while Fig. 5
    illustrates built-in alignment checker, other structure and/or methods may be used to check the
    alignment of the patient matched instrument. Thus, the breadth and scope of the present
15  invention should not be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments, but
    should be defined only in accordance with the following claims appended hereto and their
    equivalents.
