Traction elevator steel shaft structure installation as shown:
Install the weld bases of four columns of traction elevator steel
structure(1) on the ground or pit (2), at same time, the crossbeam (3)
and four vertical columns(4) to make up traction elevator steel shaft
structure basement to connect the traction machine frame (5) through
the guide rail bracket (1 1),the traction machine frame (5) fixed up on
the top of counterweight guide rail (7) and bolt with side of top car
guide rail (8) to make up the traction machine steel structure and
guide rail into integration through L type bracket(1O) .

Descriptions
About the traction elevator steel shaft structure combines guide rail and
traction machine frame integration patent technology
This technology is realizable to improve the building convenience and
accessibility with working & living conditions by adding the elevator
inside or outside the building, especially for adding the elevator in the
existing buildings in a limit space to play an important role, the effect
is particular significantly.

  THE PATENT TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION OF TRACTION
 ELEVATOR STEEL SHAFT STRUCTURE AND GUIDE RAIL
                          INTEGRATION
The following statement is full description of this invention, including
the best method of performing it known to me:

                                     2
The claims of defining the invention technology are stated as
follows:
State 1: The traction elevator steel shaft structure is made by a frame
that consist of four columns and crossbeams to connect guide rail and
traction machine frame through the guide rail bracket integration.
State 2: According to the installation method from state 1, the traction
elevator steel shaft structure and guide rail make up the whole integral
bearing frame.
State 3: According to the installation method from state 1, through
counterweight guide rail on the both ends, traction machine framework
combines on the top of cabin guide rail on the side end. Guide rail
brackets and steel shaft structure makes up an integral frame.
State 4: According to the installation method from state 1, Weld base
of four vertical columns steel shaft structure to connect with ground or
pit floor by bolts.
State 5: According to the installation method from state 1, make steel
structure shaft frame into integration through adding cross member on
the top and bottom.

The advantages of this technology as following
1. The lower the cost of elevator shaft construction and elevator
  installation;
2. Easy transportation of the steel shaft structure and installation.
3. Machine room-less steel shaft structure design saves the
  construction cost of machine room.
4. In case of fire inside the building, the outside traction elevator
  steel shaft structure combines guide rail and traction machine
  frame integration as a fast speed escape route to saving people
  life.
