                                                  1
                             Attachment for a Hand Held Appliance
   This invention relates to an attachment for a hand held appliance, in particular a hair
 5 care appliance such as a hot styling brush.
   Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
   considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
   general knowledge in the field.
10
   In a conventional hot styling brush, air is sucked into an inlet by a fan unit and directed
   towards the hair by an attachment or head. Depending on the style desired, the air may
   or may not be heated. The head or attachment often includes bristles onto which hair is
   wrapped and held for styling. The air is generally blown out of the head or attachment
15 normal to the surface of the head.
   The present invention provides an attachment for a hand held appliance comprising a
   body having a first wall; the first wall having a first edge and a second edge; a second
   wall, the second wall being moveable relative to the first wall and extending between
20 the first edge and the second edge of the first wall; and a slot formed along at least part
   of the length of the attachment, wherein a first side of the slot is is the first edge of the
   first wall and a second side of the slot is a surface of the second wall.
   Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims,
25 the words "comprise", "comprising", and the like are to be construed in an inclusive
   sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of
   "including, but not limited to".
   Preferably, the first wall is generally tubular.
30
   It is preferred that the surface of the second wall is substantially linear.

                                                   2
   Preferably, the second wall extends out from the first wall. Fluid that exits from the
   outlet will flow along the second wall and pull hair towards the second wall increasing
   drying speed and helping to align the individual hair strands.
 5
   It is preferred that the second wall is moveable relative to the first wall. Preferably, the
   second wall is rotatable with respect to the first wall.
   It is preferred that the second wall is generally triangular.
10
   Preferably, two slots are provided and the second wall separates the two slots.
   It is preferred that the second wall divides the slot into two. It is preferred that a slot is
   provided either side of the second wall.
15
   Alternatively, the slot is formed on one side of the second wall or the other side of the
   second wall.
   Preferably, the second wall has a first indexed position defining a first slot position.
20
   It is preferred that the second wall has a second indexed position defining a second slot
   position.
   Preferably, an indexed position is defined by a detent mechanism. It is preferred that
25 the detent mechanism includes an actuator biased into a recess. Preferably, the actuator
   is a ball bearing. It is preferred that the actuator is biased by a spring.
   Preferably, an external surface of the attachment includes at least one row of bristles. It
   is preferred that the external surface is an external surface of the first wall. Preferably,
30 the external surface comprises a first set of bristles comprising at least one row of
   bristles and a second set of bristles comprising at least one row of bristles.

                                                     3
   It is preferred that the first set of bristles and the second set of bristles are spaced apart
   on the external surface. Preferably, the external surface is forms at least part of the
   circumference of a circle and the first set of bristles is radially spaced from the second
 5 set of bristles.
   According to a second aspect, the invention provides a hand held appliance comprising
   a handle having a fluid flow path from a fluid inlet to a fluid outlet and a fan unit for
   drawing fluid into the fluid inlet and an attachment for attaching to the handle, the
10 attachment comprising a body having a first wall, the first wall having a first edge and a
   second edge; a second wall, the second wall being moveable relative to the first wall;
   and extending between the first edge and the second edge of the first wall; a slot
   formed along at least part of the length of the attachment, wherein a first side of the slot
   is the first edge of the first wall and and a second side of the slot is a surface of the
15 second wall.
   In one embodiment the appliance is a hair care appliance.
   In another embodiment the appliance is a hot styling appliance such as a hot styling
20 brush.

   Figures 16a and 16b show an alternative sock for the other attachment.
 5 Figures la and lb shows a hot styling brush 10 with a handle 20 and a detachable head
   or attachment 30 which is attaches at the distal end 22 of the handle 20 to the fluid inlet
   40.
   The handle 20 has an outer wall 26 which is generally tubular and includes the fluid
10 inlet 40 at and adjacent one end 24. The fluid inlet 40 comprises a first set of apertures
   44 which extend radially around the handle 20 and along the outer wall 26 of the handle
   from the handle end 24. The handle end 24 is covered by an end wall 42 which is also
   perforated with a second set of apertures 46 that extend through the end wall 42 of the
   handle. Thus, the fluid inlet 40 extends around, along and across the handle 20. The
15 end wall 42 is orthogonal to the outer wall 26 and an inner wall 60 of the handle.
   The handle 20 also includes a fan unit 70 which comprises a fan and a motor which
   drives the fan and in use, draws fluid in through the fluid inlet 40, along a fluid flow
   path 50 which extends through the length of the handle 20. The fluid is optionally
20 heater by a heater 80 before entering an inner cavity 38 of the head 30.
   The head 30 includes a fluid outlet 100 which in this example comprises parallel slots
   102 each extending towards a second end 36 of the head and radially around the head
   30. This arrangement enables fluid to exit the head all the way around the head and for
25 the majority of the length of the head 30 maximising a hair styling region of the
   product.
   In use, hair is wrapped around the head 30 whilst air or fluid exits through the slots 102
   drying the hair and/or styling the hair into curls or waves. The hair wraps automatically
30 due to the flow of air around the surface of the head 30. The air or fluid can be heated
   but this is not essential.

                                                  6
   Power is provided to the appliance via a power cable 48 which preferably extends from
   a plug or other power source through the end wall 42 of the handle 20. The handle 20
   also houses a PCB 75 which is electrically connected to the cable 48, the fan unit 70 and
 5 the heater 80 by internal wiring (not shown). An on/off switch 52 and control buttons
   54 are provided and connected to the PCB 75 to allow the user to select one of a range
   of temperature and flow settings.
   Figure 2a shows an exploded view of various parts of the handle 20 in more detail. The
10 handle 20 is tubular and the outer wall 26 of the handle 20 is a cylindrical sleeve made
   from for example an extruded tube or rolled sheet of metal such as aluminium, an
   aluminium alloy or a steel. The handle connects to a head 30 at a first end 22 and at the
   distal, second end 24 a fluid inlet 40 is provided. The fluid inlet 40 is a first means of
   filtering fluid that enters the fluid flow path 50.
15
   The fluid inlet 40 comprises a plurality of apertures extending around, along and across
   the handle 20. Having an inlet that extends in three dimensions has advantages
   particularly when used with hair grooming appliances. Firstly, if the appliance is placed
   on a surface whilst switched on only a small part of the inlet surface area will be
20 blocked or have restricted flow of fluid into the appliance. This protects the fan unit
   and particularly the motor of the fan unit from running with too low a flow rate as this
   can cause overheating of the motor and cause damage to the motor.
   Secondly, often hair care appliances are used with a styling product such as a mousse,
25 gel or spray. These products are typically either applied by a hand or directly to the hair
   as a mist. After application by a hand, some of the product will be retained on the skin
   which is then transferred to the appliance when held. This can block at least some of
   the apertures 44 that extend around and along the handle 20. However, the apertures 46
   that extend under the handle and across the end wall 42 of the handle will be unaffected.
30 When a product is applied as a mist, it can settle on the appliance and again block or
   restrict at least some of the apertures of the fluid inlet 40. However, by having apertures

                                                  7
   that extend around, along and across the handle 20 the risk of blocking the fluid inlet 40
   is reduced.
   The apertures are preferably circular with a diameter of 0.2 to 1.6 mm. The diameter of
 5 the apertures can vary along, around and across the handle 20. It is advantageous to
   space the apertures regularly around, along and across the fluid inlet 40. Not only is this
   visually pleasing but it also has the technical advantage that there is no weak region of
   the fluid inlet 40 where blockage of a portion is more likely or would have more impact
   on the flow into the fluid inlet 40. The inlet is designed so that the flow into the inlet is
10 even at least around the circumference of the handle 20.
   A foam block 48 is provided which in use is inserted into the second end 24 of the
   handle 20. The foam block 48 is a second means of filtering the fluid that passes
   through the primary fluid inlet 40 into the primary fluid flow path 50. It is
15 advantageous that the foam block 48 extends beyond or further towards the first end 22
   of the handle than the primary fluid inlet 40 as this ensures that fluid that has entered the
   primary fluid inlet 40 has passed through the foam block 48 so has had two stages of
   filtration. In other words, the foam block 48 extends from the second end 24 of the
   handle 20 past the downstream end 44a of the fluid inlet.
20
   The foam block 48 shown is cylindrical and substantially fills the area within the handle
   20 at the primary fluid inlet 40. This is to ensure that all fluid that enters the primary
   fluid inlet through first apertures 44 that extend around and along the handle and fluid
   that enters through second apertures 46 that extend across and through the end wall 42
25 of the handle 20 passes through this second stage of filtration. The foam block 48
   extends longitudinally from the second end 24 of the handle 20 further than the first
   apertures 42 of the primary fluid inlet 40.
   The first apertures 44 that extend along and around the outer wall 26 are machined,
30 punched or laser cut from the extruded tube or sheet metal that the outer wall 26 is
   formed from.

                                                 8
   The handle 20 has an outer wall 26 and an inner wall 60, the outer wall 26 slides over
   the inner wall 60 to form the finished product. The inner wall 60 is a duct which
   surrounds and defines a fluid flow path 50 through the appliance. The outer wall 26
 5 includes a grippable portion and in these examples, includes the fluid inlet 40 into the
   fluid flow path 50. An insulting layer of material 28 is provided within the inner wall
   60. The insulating layer is a foam or a felt and insulates the handle from noise produced
   by the fan unit 70, heat produced by the operation of the appliance, vibrations caused by
   the fan unit and noise produced within the appliance by the flow of fluid through the
10 fluid flow path 50. The insulating layer absorbs energy including airborne noise.
   The inner wall 60 provides a housing 62 in which a fan unit 70 is disposed. The
   housing 62 is cylindrical and has an inwardly protruding ledge 64,66 disposed one at
   each end of the housing 62 which maintain the position of the fan unit 70 within the
15 handle 20. The inner wall 60 is made from two parts a first part 60a and a second part
   60b which is moulded separately. This enables easier assembly of the fan unit 70 within
   the handle 20 than a one piece inner wall. A similar pair of inwardly protruding ledges
   68, 72 maintains the position of the heater 80 within the handle 20.
20 Although the outer wall 26 of the handle 20 has been described as being made from an
   extruded tube or a rolled sheet of metal, alternatives methods of manufacture and
   materials could be used; these include, but are not limited to, a plastic
   extrusion/moulded tube or a composite tube such as carbon fibre reinforced plastic.
25 The fluid outlet 100 of the head 30 will now be described in more detail, referring in
   particular to Figures 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 5a and 5b. The head 30 is essentially cylindrical and
   has a first end 32 for connection to a handle 20 and a second end 36 distal to the first
   end 32. The head 30 extends longitudinally from the first end 32 to the second end 26
   continuing a line described by the handle 20 (Figure 1a) so is approximately the same
30 diameter as the handle. Within the head 30 is an inner cavity 38 and fluid that has been

                                                  9
   drawn into the fluid flow path 50 within the handle 20 by the fan unit 70 enters the inner
   cavity 38 via an aperture 302 in the first end 32 of the head 30.
   The fluid outlet 100 is formed from a number of parallel slots 102 which extend along
 5 the length of the head 30 from the first end 32 to the second end 36. The slots 102 are
   formed from an overlap 120 (Figure 5b) formed between adjacent plates 110 which
   results in fluid being directed between a radially inner surface 104 formed from the
   outer surface 112 of a first plate 110a and a radially outer surface 106 formed from the
   inner surface 114 of a second plate 1 Ob. The fluid 122 flowing out of the slot 102 is
10 tangential 130 to the outer surface 112 of the plate 110a and joins with the fluid flowing
   out of the other slots of the fluid outlet 100 forming a fluid flow around the
   circumference of the head 30. Thus, the fluid 122 is blown out along the external
   surface of the head and this encourages hair to wrap around the head 30 automatically.
15 The fluid 122 exiting the slots 102 is attracted to the curved surface of the head 30 by
   the Coanda effect. This in turn causes hair that is presented to the head 30 to
   automatically wrap around the surface and then styled into curls. As air is blown down
   the length of the hair, wet hair is dried more quickly than conventionally and as the
   wrapping process occurs without the use of bristles, the hair can slide off the head 30
20 once it is dry or styled so there is no tangling.
   To maintain the size of each slot 102, spacers 108 are provided. In this example, a pair
   of spacers 108 is provided to maintain each slot 102 size. Each one of the pair of
   spacers 108 is longitudinally spaced along the slot 102 and the plate 110. The spacers
25 108 join adjacent plates 110 together.
   Advantageously, each plate 110 is lined with a felt like material 308 such as Kevlar or
   wool (see Figure 3b). The material 308 does not extend over each slot 102 so the fluid
   exiting the fluid outlet 100 does not pass through the layer of material 308. This layer
30 serves to absorb some of the noise produced by the fluid flowing through the head 30
   from the inlet to the head 30 at aperture 302 to the fluid outlet 100. Such a layer of

                                                 10
   material 308 is as applicable for other heads herein described such as heads 130, 180
   and 230.
   Figures 6a and 6b show an alternative head 130, all features identical to those
 5 previously described have the same reference numerals. The head 130 has a larger
   diameter than the handle 20 so is used to create larger curls. The head 130 has a first
   end 32 for connection to the handle 20 and this is the same diameter as the handle 20,
   within a collar 132 of the head 130, the diameter of the head 130 increases to the larger
   diameter prior to the fluid outlet 100 formed by slots 142 and then continues at a
10 constant diameter to the second end 136. An inner fluid cavity (not shown) is larger
   than for the head 30 of Figure 3a. In this example the number of plates 110 and slots
   102 is the same i.e. six as for the head described with respect to Figure 3a.
   Alternatively, a larger or smaller number of plates 110 and slots 142 could be used.
15 Figure 7a shows a further head 230. This head 230 has a reduced diameter compared
   with the handle 20. The first end 32 is substantially the same diameter as the handle 20
   for connection thereto, and then within a collar 232 the diameter of the head 230
   decreases to the reduced diameter prior to the fluid outlet 200 formed by slots 202 and
   continues at a constant diameter to the second end 236.     This head 230 is used to create
20 tighter curls.
   The slots 202 for this head extend longitudinally straight from the first end 32 to the
   second end 236 as was the case for slots 102 in heads 30, 130.
25 In another embodiment, as shown in Figures 7b and 7c, a further head 280 has slots 282
   which curve around the head 280 forming a spiral or helical pattern around the head
   230. The slots 282 curve by an angle a of 45' from the longitudinal axis A-A of the
   handle 20 and head 280. In this example the slots 282 curve in a clockwise direction
   from the first end 34 of the head 280 towards the second end 236 of the head. The slots
30 282 are formed as before between adjacent overlapping plates 210 however, in order to
   form the curved slots 282, the plates 210 do not extend along the longitudinal axis of the

                                                  11
   head 280 but also curve by an angle of 45'. Using angled slots changes the profile of
   the fluid exiting from the head. The airflow exiting from the slots is more normal to the
   slot when angled slots are used. This has benefits including enabling more hair to be
   wrapped around the head also, the hair is retained on the head more easily leading to a
 5 potentially quicker styling process.
   The slots can be curved in a clockwise or and anticlockwise direction from the
   longitudinal axis A-A of the handle 20. Whilst an angle of 450 has been illustrated,
   improved wrapping is seen even at an angle of 10.
10
   Figure 8a shows a head 180 which is substantially the same diameter as the handle 20.
   The slots 182 are curved or spiral around the head 180 in the same manner as head 280.
   Figure 8b shows a head 380 which has a larger diameter than the handle, and is similar
15 to head 130 except it has curved or spiralling slots 382 around the head 380.
   Figures 9a and 9b show a way of assembling head 30. A first part 150 is formed from
   the first end 32 and has a collar 152 and a first set of plates 154 which are joined to or
   formed integrally with the collar 152. A second part 160 is formed from the second end
20 36 and has an end wall 162 and a second set of plates 164 which are joined to or formed
   integrally with the end wall 162. The first set of plates 154 and second set of plates 164
   each comprise non-adjacent plates 110 enabling the first part 150 and the second part
   160 to be slotted together to form the head 30. Between each of the first set of plates
   154, a recess 156 is provided in the connecting ring 152 adapted to accommodate the
25 distal end 164a of the second set of plates 164 from the end wall 162. A similar set of
   recesses 166 is provided in the end wall 162 and is adapted to accommodate the distal
   end 154a of the first set of plates from the collar 32.
   In order to retain the first part 150 and the second part 160 of the head 30 in the
30 assembled condition, a protruding screw hole 168 is provided. Near the distal end 154a
   of the first set of plates 154 a support scaffold 170 is provided and this has two

                                                12
   functions. A first function is to support the first set of plates 154 and maintain their
   relative positions towards the distal end 154a and a second function is to provide part of
   the fixing mechanism. In this example, the support scaffold 170 has a central aperture
   172 through which the protruding screw hole 168 passes on assembly of the head 30a
 5 and a screw, for example can be inserted to fix the two parts 150, 160 of the head
   together.
   Figures 15a, 15b, 15c, 15d and 15e show a head 400 all features identical to those
   previously described have the same reference numerals. This head 400 has a reduced
10 diameter compared with the handle 20. The slots 102 extend longitudinally from the
   first end 32 to the second end 236, however the slots could be curved as described with
   respect to Figures 7a and 7b.
   Internal of the head 400, within the cavity 418 formed within the head 400, an internal
15 sock 420 is provided. This sock 420 is a mesh formed from a metal wire. The sock 420
   can be in the knitted form 426 shown in Figure 15b. Alternatively as shown in Figures
   16a and 16b the sock 420 is a tube 424 formed from a woven mesh 422 having
   generally square apertures.
20 The sock 420 diffuses the fluid flowing in the cavity 418 within the head 400 and slows
   down the longitudinal velocity of the flow. This results in more even wrapping of hair
   around the head 400 as the direction of fluid exiting the head 400 is more normal to the
   slots 102. The sock 420 extends along the length of the slots 102 within the head 400.
   The size of the apertures in the mesh is important; if they are too small the flow
25 becomes too restricted and there is an increased chance of them clogging over time. An
   aperture size of around 1.6mm has been found to provide the benefit without undue
   restriction.
   Figures IOa, lOb, 11 a- I1c and 12 show various views of another head 300 which has a
30 directed fluid flow. The head 300 has a first cylindrical part 310 and a second triangular
   part 330 that together form the fluid outlet 320.

                                                 13
   The first cylindrical part 310 has a first end 312 for connection to a handle 20 via a
   collar 328 and extends longitudinally to a second end 314 which comprises an end wall
   316. An inner cavity 318 is formed within the first cylindrical part 310. The first
 5 cylindrical part 310 has an aperture 322 extending from the collar 328 to the second end
   314. The aperture 322 is defined by a first edge 324 and a second edge 326.
   The second triangular part 330 has a first end 332 and a second end 334 and if formed
   from a first side 336, a second side 338 and an internal wall 340. The second triangular
10 part 330 fits within the aperture 322 and extends outwardly beyond the first cylindrical
   part 310.
   The second triangular part 330 is movable relative to the first cylindrical part 310. In
   this example, the second triangular part 330 is fixed with respect to the handle 20 and
15 the first cylindrical part 310 is moveable relative to both the second triangular part 30
   and the handle 20. This enables the outlet slot 342 to be partially defined by one or the
   other of the first edge 324 and the second edge 326.
   In one position, referring now to Figures 12a and 12b, the first edge 324 along with a
20 first side 336 of the second triangular part 330 define the limits of the outlet slot 342.
   The second triangular part 330 moves with respect to the first cylindrical part 310 so the
   outlet slot 342 is alternatively defined by the second edge 326 and the second side 338
   as shown in Figures 13a and 13b.
25 The second triangular part 330 rotates with respect to the first cylindrical part 310 in
   order to change the position of the outlet slot 342. The first cylindrical part 310 is
   temporarily retained in a position by the use of a detent mechanism.
   The end wall 316 of the first cylindrical part 310 includes a first recess 340 and a
30 second recess 350 each of which adapted to partially accommodate a ball bearing 360.
   The ball bearing 360 is biased towards the end wall 316 by a spring 362 (see Figure

                                                  14
   1 1b). There are a number of suitable alternatives that could be used instead of this
   method of retaining one part with respect to the other part such as a plastic bump feature
   or a piece of sprung metal.
 5 Referring now to Figures 12a and 12b, when the second triangular part 330 is in a first
   position with respect to the first cylindrical part 310, the outlet slot 342 is formed from
   first side 336 and first edge 324 and the ball bearing 360 is accommodated by the first
   recess. By manually rotating the second triangular part 330 with respect to the first
   cylindrical part 310 the force of the spring 362 retaining the ball bearing 360 within the
10 first recess 340 is overcome and the second triangular part 330 can be rotated with
   respect to the first cylindrical part 310 to move the ball bearing 360 into the second
   recess 350 and changing the position of the outlet slot 328 so it is now formed from the
   second edge 326 and the second side 338.
15 The first cylindrical part 310 includes bristles 350 arranged in this example in parallel
   rows 352 on either side of the aperture 322. The rows 352 of bristles 350 extend from
   near the outlet slot 342 around the head 300 but in this example the bristles 350 do not
   extend all the way around the head 300, there is a gap in the rows 352 diametrically
   opposite the outlet slot 320.
20
   Referring now to Figure 14, when hair 354 is being styled, the action of drawing the
   bristles 350 down through the hair 354 opens the outlet slot 342 on the side next to the
   hair 354. The position of the outlet slot 342 is movable by hand or by the friction or
   force of combing through the hair.
25
   The use of a combination of a directed outlet slot 342 and bristles 350 means that the
   hair is dried and/or styled more quickly than conventionally as the fluid exiting from the
   outlet slot 342 is blown down the hair 354. The fluid exiting the outlet slot 342 is
   attracted to the surface of the second triangular part 330 which in turn attracts the hair
30 354 to the second triangular part 330. The bristles 350 separate and detangle individual
   strands of the hair 354 and this combination gives fast drying and a smother result.

                                                 15
   In use as shown in Figure 14, this head is designed to be pulled through the hair with the
   slot 328 adjacent the hair 354. Fluid is blown out of the slot 328 as the appliance is
   moved along the hair 354 so the hair is both heated and brushed. Having the slot 328 on
 5 either side of the head 356 means that the same head 300 can be used for both sides of
   the head and both the underside and the topside of the hair 354.
   In each of the examples given, the head 30, 130, 180, 230, 300 in connected to handle
   20 via a collar and a twist lock joint. Referring to Figure 7b, three protrusions 234 are
10 provided on the internal surface of the collar 232 (one not shown). The protrusions 234
   are adapted to engage a slot 90 (see Figure Ib) or three separate slots provided near the
   distal end 22 of the handle 20. The slot 90 extends at least partially around an outer
   surface of the inner wall 60 and is helical so both a rotational and longitudinal
   movement is required to attach or remove the head from the handle 20. This is one
15 example of a fixing mechanism, it will be apparent to the skilled person that other
   equally acceptable alternative mechanisms could be used.
   The heads 30, 130, 180 and 230 described with respect to Figures 3a to 9 could be
   provided with bristles. For these heads 30, 130, 180 and 230 as the slots are arranged
20 all the way around the head, any bristles would be arranged all the way around the head.
   An example would be to have one or more rows of bristles at least located on every
   other plate 110, 210.
   The invention has been described in detail with respect to a hot styling brush however, it
25 is applicable to any appliance that draws in a fluid and directs the outflow of that fluid
   from the appliance including a hairdryer.
   The appliance can be used with or without a heater; the action of the outflow of fluid at
   high velocity has a drying effect.
30

                                                16
   The heads have been described as being manufactured by attaching a first part to the
   second part using a screw however, as the skilled person will be aware, a number of
   different fixing methods can be used such as, but not limited to gluing or using
   ultrasonic welding.
 5
   The fluid that flows through the appliance is generally air, but may be a different
   combination of gases or gas and can include additives to improve performance of the
   appliance or the impact the appliance has on an object the output is directed at for
   example, hair and the styling of that hair. Such additives include but are not limited to
10 hairspray and serums for example.
   The heads 30, 130, 230 are all generally cylindrical in shape, however as the skilled
   person would realise, alternative shapes could be used such as ovals.
15 The invention is not limited to the detailed description given above. Variations will be
   apparent to the person skilled in the art.
