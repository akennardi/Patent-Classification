                                     ABSTRACT
 The Mobile Quad Lattice Mast is an Innovation to the industry standard, designed to
minimise maintenance and make it easier to deploy and stow with Less pinch points.
Mast sections are fabricated into an aluminium 4 post Lattice style, dimensions
300mm x 300mm. The 2 sections are Locked together on all 4 posts with a coupling
style tapered pin system.
The mast provides more flexibility, is modular and the system is scalable with ease.
They are engineered with exceptional strength to allow for more weight on the mast
and to except more wind Load and most importantly it allows for easy cable
management. The simplistic design of the Lattice mast allows you to secure the
cabling from the inside of the mast as a permanent fixture.
System is rigid and stable but very Lightweight, only weighing in at approximately
40kgs. The system has multi point attachments and is deployed to its vertical position
by means of a brake winch, supported by 3.8T 316 Stainless Steel cable, into its fixed
Locked position. In the stow position, the base is a 5m Long section and the hinged
section which unfolds around to 1 side at 1800, increases the height of the mast to
8m's. One Large advantage to the system design allows the mast to be retrofitted onto
almost anything and suit a range of different applications such as surveittlance, time
Lapse photography, mobile Lighting, disaster relief, surveying/mapping and
temporary communications.

                      Quad Lattice Mast System
The Mobile Quad Lattice Mast is an Innovation to the industry standard, designed to
minimise maintenance and make it easier to deplay and stow with less pinch points.
Mast sections are fabricateci [Into an aLuminium 4 post latte style, dimensions
300mm x 300mm. The 2 sections are locked together on all 4 posts wEth a coupling
style tapered pin system.
The mast provides more flex ibility, is modular and the system is scatable with ease.
They are engineered with exception[ strength to allow for more weight on the mast
and to except more wind load and most importantly [t allows for easy cable
management
The sLim plistic design of the Lattice mast allows you to secure the cabling from the
inside of the mast as a permanent fixture.
Mas I system is rigid and stable but very lightweight, only weigh Ing in at
approximateLy 40kgs.
The mast system has multi point attachments and Is deployed to its vertical position
by means of a brake winchr supported by 3.8T 316 Stainless Steel cable, into its
fixed Locked position. In the stow position, the base [s a 5m long section and the
hinged section which unfolds around to 1 side at 180, increases the height of the
mast to 8m's.
One large advantage to the system design allows the mast to be retrofitted onto
almost anything and suit a range of different applications such as surveilance, time
tapse photography, mobile lighting, disaster relief, surveying/mapping and
temporary communications.
The standard mast height is 8m's with the ability to extend higher in the future if
required depending on additional windshear and headLoad.
