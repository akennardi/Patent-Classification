ABSTRACT
The present invention is an improved method and assembly for repairing a pipe
or the junction of two pipes, such as sewer pipes. The assembly includes a
launcher device having a launcher device body, a launcher device opening
disposed on the launcher device body, and a main bladder substantially
surrounding the launcher device body. The main bladder includes an opening that
substantially aligns with the launcher device opening. The assembly further
includes an absorbent liner and a lateral bladder having a tubular lateral bladder
body portion and a flange portion. The flange portion of the lateral bladder is
attached to the exterior of the launcher device body. A method of using the
assembly includes impregnating the liner with resinous material; inserting at least
a portion of the liner into the lateral bladder; inflating the bladders; pressing the
liner against the pipe; and allowing the resinous material to cure and harden.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
               The invention relates generally to sewer pipe repair. More particularly, but
not exclusively, the invention relates to an improved method and apparatus for
repairing the junction of a main and lateral pipe.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
                One method of repairing a damaged sewer pipe is known as cured-in-place
pipelining (CIPP). CIPP involves using a lining assembly including a main
bladder, a lateral bladder tube extending from the main bladder, and a lateral liner
tube. The lateral bladder tube may be separate from the main bladder to
accommodate instances when a different diameter of lateral pipe needs repaired.
Such a liner assembly and a method of use are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,950,682,
which is owned by the applicant and hereby incorporated by reference in its
entirety (and attached as Appendix A).
                                                              1

                However, problems exist with such methods and apparatus. Because the
lateral bladder tube extends from the main bladder, the two bladders must be
inflated at the same time in some embodiments. This increases the internal
pressure on the connection between the main and lateral bladder. If the seal is not
tight, a leak may form. The leak makes it difficult to fully inflate the bladders to
press the lateral liner and liner collar against the wall of the lateral pipe and the
junction between the main and lateral pipe. When this pressure is not great
enough, the liner will not cure properly. There may be folds in the liner, or the
liner may cure away from the wall of the pipe. If folds are formed, they would
have to be cut or sanded out. If the liner cures away from the wall, it would have
to be redone. In either case, it would be both expensive and time consuming to fix
the problem of the liner assembly not inflating properly.
                A separate problem exists with methods and apparatus that include
independent main and lateral bladders. In those embodiments, the means of
connecting the bladders to a launcher interferes with the process of installing a
cured-in-place liner. Specifically, the lateral or auxiliary bladder disclosed in U.S.
Pat. No. 5,950,682 is attached to the interior of a rim protruding from a launcher
device. Such an attachment can create voids between the launcher device and the
bladders, allowing resin to interact with the launcher device. This increases clean
up time and potentially damages the launcher device. Therefore, there is a need in
the art for an improved or alternative method and apparatus for repairing the
junction of a main and lateral pipe that incorporates the use of a separate main
and lateral bladder to expand to press a lateral liner tube and/or a main line liner
member against the wall of a lateral pipe and the junction of a main and lateral
pipe.
                There is also a need in the art for a method and apparatus for repairing the
junction of a main and lateral pipe that is easily changeable at a job site to account
                                                             2

H:\gw\!nriterwoveinNRP         W\160550 65_1.doc-1 1/28/2017
for varying diameters of pipes. A limitation of U.S. Pat. No. 5,950,682 is that the
opening of the launcher device must be substantially the same diameter as the
lateral bladder. This limitation may be unnecessary, due to the fact that many
different diameters of lateral pipes may be used in sewer systems. Therefore, a
separate launcher would be required to repair a sewer system having lateral pipes
of varying diameters. It can be both expensive and time consuming to provide
separate launchers to repair different pipes within the same sewer system.
                Lastly, there is a need in the art for a method and apparatus for repairing
the junction of a main and lateral pipe that includes a fully reusable lateral
bladder. Known methods employ pushing a liner into a lateral bladder using a
rod, which requires an end of the lateral bladder to be open, in order to string the
liner along the lateral bladder. The open end of the bladder is then closed for the
inversion process. The bladder may be discarded after the inversion and curing
process. If an attempt to reuse the bladder was to be made, such a reuse can be
impractical and inconvenient. Because the end of the lateral bladder must be open
during placement of the liner, the lateral bladder must be cut after a first use to
place a second liner within the lateral bladder. This must be done in order to gain
access to the interior of the bladder. The cutting makes the lateral bladder shorter.
After placing a second liner within the lateral bladder, the bladder must be
reclosed, using even more bladder material to make the seal. For many
applications, the loss of such a bladder length would make reuse of the bladder
impractical, as the bladder is unfit for pipe repair lengths equal to or greater than
the first pipe repair. Furthermore, the process of cutting the lateral bladder and
reclosing it is a time intensive process. Therefore, there is a need in the art for an
improved or alternative method and apparatus for repairing the junction of a
main and lateral pipe that incorporates the use of a fully reusable lateral bladder
that is configured for rapid reuse.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE
INVENTION
                FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a lateral bladder 22 used with embodiments
of the present invention. The present invention allows a bladder to be field
changeable, reusable, and/or custom made on the job site. As shown in FIG. 1, the
embodiment comprises a first end 24 comprising a lateral connect 26, a second
lateral end 28 and a lateral bladder body 30 there between. The lateral bladder
body 30 may be made from a roll of bulk bladder material that is cut to length and
diameter. For example, a lateral pipe may be measured to be 4" in diameter and an
area of repair measured to be 39' 7" in length. The lateral bladder body 30 may be
cut from a bulk material from a bulk roll of 4" diameter material to get the 39' 7"
length needed.
                Next, the lateral bladder body 30 is connected to the lateral connect 26, to
form the lateral bladder 22. The lateral connect 26 is generally a hat shaped
                                                          6

bladder piece. The lateral connect 26 may consist of a flange portion 54 and a
tubular portion 78 extending from the flange portion 54. Flange portion 54 and
tubular portion 78 of the lateral connect 26 can be constructed of the same
material, and can be the bladder material used for the bladder body 30. Some
materials that may be used for the lateral connect 26 may include PVC,
polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane, or any other material capable of being
used as bladder material. Alternatively, the flange portion 54 and tubular portion
78 may be made of different materials. For instance, the flange portion 54 could be
made of a PVC material and could be fused to the tubular portion 78, constructed
of another bladder material such as polyethylene. Many materials are
contemplated for the lateral connect 26, as long as the material is compatible with
or capable of being attached to the bladder body 30. It should be noted that the
lateral bladder depicted in FIG. 1 is for an embodiment of the invention that can
be rapidly prepared in the field. In other embodiments, the lateral bladder 22 may
be formed at a remote location by heat welding bladder material together to form
a lateral bladder comprising a tubular body portion and a flange portion.
                In attaching the lateral bladder body 30 to the lateral connect 26, the tubular
portion 78 is generally the same diameter as the diameter of the bladder body 30
previously cut to length. In addition, the flange portion 54 of the lateral connect 26
may include a plurality of holes 80 for connecting to a launcher device, as will be
discussed in greater detail below. To fit the lateral connect 26 to the bladder
body 30 to form a lateral bladder 22, the tubular portion 78 of the lateral connect
 26 is inserted within the lateral bladder body 30. A glue or solvent is added
around the periphery of the tubular portion 78 of the lateral connect 26 before it is
inserted into the lateral bladder body 30. Next, a pneumatic plug (not shown) or
the like is inserted through the lateral connect 26 adjacent the tubular portion 78 of
the lateral connect 26 within the lateral bladder body 30. The portion of the lateral
                                                             7

bladder body 30 and lateral connect 26 to be fused is optionally placed within a
rigid tube, the pneumatic plug is inflated, and the pressure is maintained within
the pneumatic plug to allow the lateral connect 26 to bond to the lateral bladder
body 30. This bonding process also acts to smooth out wrinkles which may occur
when the tubular portion 78 of the lateral connect 26 is inserted into the lateral
bladder body 30. The pneumatic plug remains inflated until the glue or solvent
material between the tubular portion 78 of the lateral connect 26 and the lateral
bladder body 30 has bonded the two members to form the lateral bladder 22. The
lateral bladder 22 is then attached to a launcher device.
                FIGS. 2 a and 2 b illustrate the connection of the lateral bladder 22 to a
launcher device 12. The launcher device 12 is a pipe or other member that is used
to transport the bladders and liner to a position within a pipe. The launcher
device 12 may generally comprise an open end 14, a closed end 16, and an opening
18 there between. The launcher device 12 may include a ramped interior that may
act to hold the lateral bladder 22. Further, the launcher device 12 may optionally
include a collar 20. The collar 20 includes a plurality of holes 52 corresponding to
the holes 80 of the flange portion of the lateral connect 26. Therefore, the lateral
bladder 22 may be connected directly to the launcher device 12 via the lateral
connect 26 and the collar 20. The collar 20 may also include a protruding rim (not
shown) to support the lateral connect 26 of the lateral bladder 22. Such an
embodiment would be effective with the lateral bladder body 30, because the
protruding rim would provide a portion of the launcher device 12 to act as point
of attachment for the lateral bladder body 30 in addition to providing structural
support. For example, tubular portion 78 of the lateral connect 26 may be placed
over the protruding rim, a band or clamp may be applied to the outside of the
lateral connect 26, and the flange portion 54 may be folded upward and taped to
the clamp or band. Such an embodiment is discussed further in relation to FIGS.
                                                             8

9-11. Alternatively, another structural point of attachment for the lateral
bladder 22 may be the open end 14 of the launcher device 12. In such an
alternative embodiment, the first end 24 of the lateral bladder 30 is attached to a
rim of the open end 14 of the launcher device 12 instead of the collar 20. The flange
portion 54 of the lateral connect 26 may be folded over the rim and secured to the
outer surface of the launcher device 12.
                The embodiment of FIGS. 2 a and 2 b show where the lateral bladder 22 and
launcher device 12 are connected by the use of bolts 19 are inserted through the
holes 80 in the flange portion 54 of the lateral connect 26 and into threaded
holes 52 on the collar 20 of the launcher device 12. Alternatively, the flange
portion 54 of the lateral connect 26 may be connected to the launcher device 12 by
use of a glue or solvent between the flange portion 54 and the launcher device 12.
In certain embodiments, a retaining ring and a gasket (not shown) may be used to
secure the flange portion 54 to the launcher device collar 20. A gasket would be
used for instances when a seal between the lateral bladder 22 and the launcher
device 12 is desired. It should be noted that a seal between the lateral bladder 22
and launcher device 12 is not required to practice this invention, because in
operation, a main bladder 32 may be inflated first, covering the lateral connect
portion 26 of the lateral bladder tube 22, sealing it against the launcher device 12.
                FIG. 3 is a sectional view of a launcher device 12, lateral bladder 22, and
main bladder 32 used with the present invention located at a junction 74 between
a main pipe 70 and a lateral pipe 72. The lateral bladder 22 is inverted through the
opening 18 of the launcher device 12 either before or after attachment to the
launcher device 12. The second end 28 of the lateral bladder 22 is closed by a band
or clamp 64. Connected to this band or clamp 64 may be a loop 66 and a line 58.
The clamp, loop, and line connections allow the lateral bladder 22 to be inverted
within a space inside the launcher device 12. Generally, the lateral bladder 22 will
                                                             9

be inverted along the ramp in the launcher device 12. Also connected to the
launcher device 12 and lateral bladder 22 is a fluid line 56, which will be discussed
in greater detail below.
                Shown in FIG. 3 to be at least partially surrounding the launcher device 12
and flange portion 54 of the lateral bladder 22 is a main bladder 32. The main
bladder 32 comprises two layers of expandable material having a generally
tubular shape with a first end 34, a second end 36, and a main bladder opening 38
there between. The two layers of expandable material are fused together around
the main bladder opening 38 such that the two layers form a barrier which is air or
fluid impermeable, as illustrated in FIG. 4. The main bladder opening 38
corresponds to the opening 18 in the launcher device. The first end 34 of the main
bladder 32 is secured at the open end 14 of the launcher device such that the first
end 34 is air tight. The second end 36 of the main bladder 32 is then secured at the
closed end 16 of the launcher device 12 in such a way that the second end 36 of the
main bladder 32 is air tight as well. A port 60 (see also FIGS. 2 a and 2 b) is
included in the launcher device 12 to provide a second fluid source to inflate the
main bladder. When the main bladder 32 is inflated, the fluid within the two
layers of expandable material creates a pillow that secures the launcher device 12
to the main pipe, and optionally seals the lateral connect 26 to the launcher
device 12.
                One of the objects of this invention is to provide independent inflation of
the main bladder 32 and lateral bladder 22 by connecting the lateral bladder 22 to
the launcher device 12 without the need for the lateral bladder 22 to be connected
to the main bladder 32. This is accomplished by providing a separate port 60 in the
launcher device that provides for inflation of the main bladder 32. The port 60
may include a variety of means for providing fluid to the main bladder 32. The
port 60 may comprise a pin or needle-like protrusion to provide inflation, as the
                                                             10

H:\gw\!nriterwovetnNRP         W\160550 65_1.doc-1 1/28/2017
inner layer of bladder material could be punctured by the protrusion.
Alternatively, the port 60 could simply be a hole that aligns with an opening on
the inner layer of the main bladder 32. Another embodiment includes placing a
Schrader valve on the inner layer of the main bladder 32 and attaching it to
port 60, providing a controlled, independent inflation of the main bladder 32, even
if a single source of fluid is used. In a first embodiment, the fluid to provide
inflation is provided by a single air hose 56 to the launcher device 12. In another
embodiment, a second air hose (not shown) is used with the launcher device 12.
The first air hose provides inflation means for the main bladder 32 by attaching to
the port 60 within the launcher device, and a second air hose provides a separate
inflation means for the lateral bladder 22 by attaching to the open end 14 of the
launcher device 12.
                FIG. 5 is a view of an alternative embodiment of a lateral liner 40. The
lateral liner 40 is formed from a rectangular sheet of resin absorbent material. The
bulk material is cut to form the desired length and width of the rectangle. The
rectangle may then be rolled into a tubular shape by overlapping the edges of the
rectangle. Alternatively, the edges of the rectangle may be stitched or fused
together to form a tube. In either alternative, the lateral liner 40 should be in a
tubular shape after expansion of the bladder and setting of a curable resin. It
should further be appreciated that the liner material may have a resin
impermeable coating on one side, but that is not a necessity.
                The lateral liner 40 should include an anchor point to either the lateral
bladder 22 or to the pipe junction. The anchor point serves to immobilize the
lateral liner 40 after it is loaded onto the launcher device 12 and assures accurate
placement of the lateral liner 40 within the pipes to be repaired. For applications
where the lateral liner 40 is used for a repair solely within a lateral pipe, the
anchor point may be provided by frangibly connecting the lateral liner 40 to the
                                                             11

lateral bladder 22 by the use of an adhesive or solvent. Once the lateral liner 40 is
installed within the lateral pipe and the resinous material has cured, the lateral
bladder 22 is removed. When the lateral bladder 22 is removed, the frangible
connection is broken and the liner is left within the pipe. For applications where
the liner assembly is used to repair the junction of a main and lateral pipe, an
anchor point for the lateral liner 40 may be provided by the use of a main liner
member attached to an end of the lateral liner 40. Such an anchor point may be
created by connecting the lateral liner 40 to a sheet of liner material cut to fit at
least partially within the main pipe to be repaired. Another way to provide such
an anchor point is to flare a portion of the lateral liner 40 after placing it into a
tubular shape. The flared portion of lateral liner 40 is configured to fit at least
partially within the main pipe to be repaired.
                FIG. 5 illustrates an embodiment where a gasket 50 is included with the
lateral liner 40. To attach the gasket 50 to the lateral liner 40, the lateral liner 40 is
placed on a table with a first end 42 spread out to form a flared portion. A circular
gasket 50 (shown in plan view in FIG. 5) having an aperture through the center of
it is then placed over the second end 46 of the lateral liner 40 along the lateral liner
body 48 and is placed adjacent the flared portion of the first end 42 of the lateral
liner 40. The gasket 50 and the lateral liner 40 are then optionally secured together
by either stitching the gasket 50 to the lateral liner 40 or fusing the gasket 50 to the
liner body 48. If the gasket 50 is attached or fused to the lateral liner 40, the
gasket 50 may serve as an anchor point. While the lateral liner 40 is generally
comprised of a resin absorbent material, the gasket 50 may be comprised of a
hydrophilic material which is capable of expanding in the presence of water. The
gasket 50 may also be a rubber material as well.
                FIG. 6 is a view similar to FIG. 3 showing the lateral liner 40 and gasket 50
also included with the liner assembly 10 at the junction 74 of the main pipe 70 and

lateral pipe 72. The lateral liner 40 is resin saturated with a resinous material
capable of curing and hardening, and then drawn into the lateral bladder 22 as
shown in FIG. 6. To do so, holes may be placed through the second end 46 of the
lateral liner 40. A rope or line is inserted through the holes and then inserted
through the inverted lateral bladder 22 in the launcher device 12. The rope or line
is pulled to invert the lateral liner 40 into the inverted lateral bladder 22. Pulling
the lateral liner 40 into the lateral bladder 22 inverts the lateral liner 40 within the
lateral bladder 22. The rope or line is then removed from the second end 46 of the
lateral liner 40, the lateral bladder 22 is clamped closed, and the open end 14 of the
launcher device 12 is closed. Alternatively, the lateral liner 40 may be placed
within a lateral bladder 22 that has already been clamped closed, which will be
described in further detail below. In this position, if the lateral liner 40 has a
coated side, the coated side of the lateral liner 40 will be next to the body 30 of the
lateral bladder 22 and the non-coated side of the lateral liner 40 will be facing
inwards. The liner assembly 10 is now ready to be positioned in a main pipe 70
adjacent a lateral pipe 72.
                The liner assembly 10 is pulled or pushed through a main pipe 70 to be
positioned adjacent a lateral pipe 72. A line may be connected to the launcher
device 12 and liner assembly 10 to pull the device, or a positioning robot (not
shown) may be used to position the liner assembly 10 within the main pipe 70.
FIG. 6 shows the correct positioning of the liner assembly 10 within a main pipe 70
such that the opening 18 of the launcher device 12 is directly adjacent the opening
of the lateral pipe 72.
                FIG. 7 is a view similar to FIG. 6 showing the liner assembly 10 inflated in
the main pipe 70 and lateral pipe 72 with the lateral liner 40 pressed against the
lateral pipe 72 and the junction 74. Air, or another fluid, is added to the main
bladder 32 and the lateral bladder 22. The fluid may be added by a fluid line 56
                                                             13

and a port 60. However, it should be noted that the lateral bladder 22 and main
bladder 32 are separately inflated in this embodiment, as previously described.
The inflation of the lateral bladder 22 will cause the lateral bladder 22 and the
lateral liner 40 to evert through the opening 18 of the launcher device 12 and into
the lateral pipe 72. The evertion causes the non-coated side of the lateral liner 40 to
be pressed against the wall of the lateral pipe 72. In addition, the main bladder 32
is inflated to press the gasket 50 or collar portion of the lateral liner 40 against the
junction 74 between the main pipe 70 and lateral pipe 72. Because the main
bladder 32 includes a main bladder opening 38, the lateral bladder 22 and lateral
liner 40 are able to evert through the opening 18 and into the lateral pipe 72. The
inflation is maintained until the resinous material, which has been saturated into
the lateral liner 40, has been allowed to cure and harden. At this point, the fluid is
removed and the lateral bladder 22 must be removed from the lateral pipe 72.
                The lateral bladder 22 is removed by pulling a line 58 connected to a loop
66 at the second end 28 of the lateral bladder 22, which peels the lateral bladder 22
away from the lateral liner 40. Thus, the lateral liner 40 remains in the lateral
pipe 72 providing a repaired wall of the lateral pipe 72. Likewise, the main
bladder 32 is deflated to leave the hydrophilic gasket 50 at the junction 74 between
the main pipe 70 and lateral pipe 72. The hydrophilic gasket 50 helps seal the
junction 74 from water by expanding in the presence of water to block the flow of
water behind the gasket 50, which could increase the damage at the junction 74
between the main pipe 70 and lateral pipe 72. Once the lateral bladder 22 has been
reinverted into the launcher device 12 and the main bladder 32 has been deflated,
the launcher device 12 may be removed from the main pipe 70.
                FIG. 8 is a second embodiment according to the invention configured for
rapid reuse. The configuration is similar to the one depicted in FIG. 3, with two
main alterations. First, the use of a lay flat hose 100 is depicted. If the length of the
                                                             14

lateral pipe to be repaired is longer than the length of the launcher device 12, a lay
flat hose 100 may be included with the liner assembly to accommodate longer
lengths of lateral bladder and lateral liner. The lay flat hose 100 is connected to the
open end 14 of the launcher device 12. The lay flat hose allows an additional
length of lateral liner 40 (not shown) and lateral bladder 22 to be inverted through
the opening 18 of the launcher device 12. It should be noted that the use of the lay
flat hose 100 is optional and does not affect the method of inflating and everting
the lateral bladder 22 and lateral liner into the lateral pipe. In the embodiment
depicted in FIG. 8, the launcher device 12 is connected to the lay flat hose 100 by
the use of a sealing mechanism. The sealing mechanism for the lay flat hose 100
may be a cam lock 104 or other mechanism that is capable of releasably attaching
the lay flat hose 100 to the launcher device 12. Such a mechanism should allow for
a quick and easy release from the launcher device 12, allowing for easy access and
rapid reloading of the lateral bladder 22.
                A second alteration of the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 8 is that an
opening 102 is inserted into the second end 28 of the lateral bladder 22. The
primary role of the opening 102 is to provide a means to load a new lateral liner
into the same lateral bladder 22 by allowing a rope 108 or line to be received by a
technician to place a new lateral liner within the lateral bladder 22. After the new
lateral liner is loaded, the opening 102 may remain open to act as a steam exhaust
port for applications where the resin is cured by steam. In applications where an
ambient cure resin is employed, a blocking member may be placed over the
opening 102. The blocking member may be any member that is capable of
temporarily blocking the opening 102. For example, the blocking member could be
duct tape. When the lateral bladder 22 is everted into the lateral pipe, the blocking
member will be on the interior of the lateral bladder 22 and the pressure of the
                                                             15

fluid on the interior of the lateral bladder 22 will act to keep the blocking member
in place.
                In operation, a first lateral liner is installed into a lateral pipe as described
in relation to FIGS. 1-7. The lateral bladder 22 is removed from a first lateral pipe
and is pulled and inverted through the opening 18 of the launcher device 12. The
lateral bladder 22 is long enough to extend into the lay flat hose 100. The lay flat
hose 100 is disconnected from the launcher device 12 by use of cam-locks 104. The
lay flat hose 100 is removed, exposing the lateral bladder 22. A rod 106 including a
rope 108 is inserted into the lateral bladder 22 at the opening 18 of the launcher
device 12, and extends to the second end 28 of the lateral bladder 22 so that the
rope 108 passes through the opening 102 in the second end 28 of the lateral
bladder 22. A new lateral liner soaked in a resinous material may now be pulled
into the lateral bladder 22 using the rope 108. Alternatively, the rope 108 may be
doubled and attached to the new lateral liner by a hole in the new lateral liner. The
new lateral liner may then be loaded in the same manner as described in relation
to FIG. 6. In such an embodiment, the rope 108 is threaded through a hole in the
new lateral liner, the new lateral liner is placed into the lateral bladder 22, and
both ends of the rope 108 are pushed toward opening 102 by the rod 106. The new
lateral liner is secured and pulled into place by a technician. Once the new lateral
liner is in place, one end of the rope 108 is released, and the other end of the rope
108 is pulled through the hole in the new lateral liner and through the opening 102
in the lateral bladder 22. The new lateral liner is now in place. The opening 102 is
optionally closed with a blocking member, the lay flat hose 100 is connected to the
launcher device 12, the new liner assembly is positioned within a main pipe for
deployment, the main bladder and the lateral bladder 22 are inflated with a fluid,
the lateral bladder 22 and new lateral liner are inverted into a second lateral pipe,
and the resinous material is allowed to cure and harden. The fluid is removed

from the lateral bladder 22, the lateral bladder 22 is removed from the second
lateral pipe using line 58, and the process may be repeated.
                The embodiment depicted in FIG. 8 provides a method and apparatus
where the lateral bladder 22 remains intact, unchanged, and attached to the
launcher device 12. Therefore, a new lateral liner may be quickly reloaded into the
launcher device 12. Since no changes to the assembly were required after the
placement of a first lateral liner, a plurality of lateral liners may be rapidly
installed into a plurality of lateral pipes using the same lateral bladder 22.
                FIGS. 9-11 depict a third embodiment according to the present invention
where the lateral bladder 122 may be prepared at a remote location from the
installation site, where the launcher device 112 includes a protruding collar 120,
where the lateral bladder 122 is attached to the exterior of the collar 120 of the
launcher device 112, and where the launcher device includes separate fluid
sources 124, 126. This embodiment addresses deficiencies in the art where a two
bladder system is employed to repair either a junction of a main and lateral sewer
pipe or a section of a lateral pipe.
                FIG. 9 shows the launcher device 112, including a first launcher end 114, an
opposite second launcher end 116, and a launcher device body 118 there between,
and a collar 120 having an interior and an exterior protruding from an
opening 130 on the launcher device body 118. FIG. 9 shows where a main
bladder 132 has been placed onto the launcher device 112 and substantially
surrounds the launcher device body 118. The main bladder 132 has a first main
bladder end 134, an opposite second main bladder end 136, and a main bladder
opening 138 there between, and the main bladder 132 is placed onto the launcher
device 112 such that the collar 120 enters the main bladder opening 138. As in the
previous embodiments, the main bladder 132 comprises two layers of expandable
                                                             17

material having a generally tubular shape. The two layers of expandable material
are fused together around the main bladder opening 138 such that the two layers
form a barrier which is air or fluid impermeable, as illustrated in FIG. 4. The first
main bladder end 134 is secured at the first launcher end 114 such that the
connection is air tight. The main bladder end 136 is then secured at the second
launcher end 116 in such a way that the connection is air tight as well. In this
embodiment, the main bladder 132 can be unattached to the launcher device 112 at
or near the main bladder opening 138. A lay flat hose 100 provides a fluid
source 126 to the interior of the launcher device 112 once attached to the first
launcher end 114. A port 160 and fluid source 124 are included in the launcher
device 112 to provide a second fluid source to inflate the main bladder 132. When
the main bladder 132 is inflated, the fluid within the two layers of expandable
material creates a pillow that secures the launcher device 112 to the main pipe.
                A lateral bladder 122 is attached to the launcher device, as illustrated in
FIG. 10. FIG. 10 shows the lateral bladder 122 attached to the launcher device 112
at the exterior of the collar 120 by a band 140. Alternatively, lateral bladder 122
may be attached to the exterior of the collar 120 of the launcher device 112 by the
use of a clamp, clip, adhesive, strap, screw, or other fastener. The lateral bladder
may be produced at a location remote to the installation site, because the lateral
bladder 122 should be made to easily fit the collar 120 of the launcher device 112.
In cases where a flange portion is desired for lateral bladder 122, the flange
portion may be attached to the lateral bladder 122 in the field or attached at a
factory using heat welding, adhesives, or mechanical connections such as stitches.
The flange portion could be folded over the band 140, attached to the launcher
device body 118, or attached to the exterior of the protruding collar 120. In the
illustrated embodiment, lateral bladder 122 comprises a one-piece tubular bladder.
It should be noted that lateral bladder 122 has been attached to the launcher
                                                             18

device 112 after main bladder 132 in the illustrated embodiment, but the lateral
bladder 122 may be attached before main bladder 132. Once the main bladder 132
and lateral bladder 122 are attached to the launcher device 112, a liner 142 must be
loaded onto the launcher device 112.
                FIG. 11 is a sectional view of the third embodiment showing a liner 142
included with the launcher device 112 at the junction 74 of a main pipe 70 and
lateral pipe 72. The liner 142 is shown to have a lateral portion 146 and a main line
portion 144 which acts as an anchor point. Alternatively, the liner 142 may include
other anchor points as discussed above. The liner 142 is saturated with a resinous
material capable of curing and hardening and drawn onto or into the lateral
bladder 122. The lateral bladder 122 may be inverted into launcher device
body 118 to load the liner 142. The lateral portion 146 of liner 142 may be drawn
into lateral bladder 122 until main line portion 144 sits on top of main bladder 132,
remaining outside of launcher device body 118. The lay flat hose may then be
attached to the first launcher end 114.
                In operation, the loaded launcher device 122 is inserted into a main pipe 70
and the launcher device opening 130 is aligned with the opening of a lateral
pipe 72 as previously described. The first fluid source 124 inflates the main
bladder 132 with a fluid, pressing the main bladder 132 and main line portion 144
of liner 142 against the walls of the main pipe 70. A fluid is then provided by the
second fluid source 126 to the interior of the launcher device body 118 to the
lateral bladder 122, forcing the lateral bladder 122 to evert into the lateral pipe 72.
Since the main line portion 144 of liner 142 has been pressed against the walls of
the main pipe, lateral portion 146 of liner 142 is easily pressed against the walls of
the lateral pipe 72 with minimal shifting or movement. The resinous material in
the liner 142 is then allowed to cure and harden. Since lateral bladder 122 has been
attached to the exterior of the collar 120 of the launcher device 112, there is
                                                             19

minimal resin migration into the junction between the main bladder 132 and
lateral bladder 122. After the resinous material has cured and hardened, the
bladders 122, 132 are deflated, and the launcher device 112 is removed from the
junction 74. This embodiment may be configured for rapid reuse, as in the second
embodiment.
                Embodiments according to the present invention allow a user to install any
length and diameter of lateral liner to renew the wall of a lateral pipe and the
junction between the lateral and main pipes. This is done by having a lateral
bladder which can be quickly constructed at a job site by including a lateral
connect to any diameter of a lateral bladder and sizing the length of lateral
bladder as needed for the particular job. Because the main bladder will work with
any size, it does not need to be constructed on site or connected to the lateral
bladder. This will accommodate a wide range of pipe sizes needing repair. In
addition, the main bladder will last for approximately 20 installs such that it will
not have to be replaced on the launcher device. While the lateral bladder may
need to be changed for each job, if a similar sized pipe diameter and length needs
repair, a constructed lateral bladder is used for 3-5 installs providing the length is
sufficient for all repairs. There are at least two advantages of utilizing the methods
of this disclosure. First, the installer and customer will share a substantial cost
savings because the assembly is reusable. Secondly, productivity will be increased
as the reusable liner assembly may be constructed, loaded, and/or reloaded in a
short amount of time.
