                                                   OVERVIEW
           One        of      the       problems          during            a     catheter          ablation
   procedure,             such      as     ablation           of      the      pulmonary           vein,       is
   visualization of                 the procedure.                   Typically, the pulmonary
 5 vein     is      presented           as   a    three-dimensional                    (3D)     image,       and
   as   a     surgeon           performs          the     ablation            he/she         re-positions
   and/or        rotates          and/or         changes          the      magnification               of    the
   image      to observe the progress of the procedure.                                             Surgeons
   using       this       method        for     tracking           the      procedure           have      found
10 the    use        and    manipulation              of    a     3D    image,        typically           while
   ablating,            both        complicated               and        difficult             to      execute
   efficiently.
           An       embodiment            of    the    present            invention           solves       this
   problem          by    acquiring           a    3D    map       of     a     lumen,       such       as   the
15 pulmonary           vein,       that      is     inside         a   body       of    a   subject.         The
   3D   map       is    transformed             into      a     two-dimensional                  (2D)     image
   by   projecting               the      3D    map     onto         an     annulus,           and     the     2D
   image is presented to the surgeon on a display screen.
           Using         this      method,         the     surgeon           is    able       to    view     and
20 manipulate             a    3D    image        of    a     region          of     an     ablation,          as
   described            above,          while        being          simultaneously                 presented
   with       a      stationary             two-dimensional                    (2D)       image        of    the
   region.
           In       one     embodiment,             in    the        ablation          of     a    pulmonary
25 vein,        the       region         of     ablation             comprises            a    cylindrical
   structure.              A processor acquiring the 3D image                                    transforms
   this     cylindrical               structure          into         a   2D      annulus,          with     the
   two    edges         of     the     cylindrical              structure           transformed            into
   the    inner         and      outer       circumferences                  of    the      annulus,         and
30 the    area         of     the     cylindrical              structure            transformed            into
                                                              6
           3447779v1

   the     area        of    the    annulus.         The     display      screen          that       the
   surgeon            observes        during        the      ablation       procedure,                 is
   divided          into     two   areas:        The    manipulable       3D    image of             the
   region          of     ablation,        together        with     other     parts          of      the
 5 heart,         is     displayed       in    one    area     of   the   display            screen,
   whereas           the    stationary         2D    annulus       is   displayed             in     the
   other area.
             In        another       embodiment,             once     the       surgeon             has
   determined              the     starting        point       of    the     ablation,               the
10 processor calculates,                   based on this          starting point and on
   the     known        geometry       of    the    pulmonary       vein,     a    recommended
   path        for     the     ablation       procedure.           This    path        is      marked
   both       in     the    3D   image      and   in    the    2D   annulus       in      order        to
   guide the            surgeon.       The    recommended path is             a path around
15 the        pulmonary           vein,       such       that,      when      the          ablation
   procedure has been                 completed, a heartbeat               activation wave
   will be blocked.
             In     yet    another      embodiment,          while    an   ablation            lesion
   is   growing during the procedure,                         the processor calculates
20 the      locations           where     the     surgeon       should     start         the       next
   ablation lesion in order to ensure the elimination of                                             any
   gaps      between the ablation                 lesions.        There will usually be
   two     such        locations,        one     on   either      side    of    the        existing
   ablation lesions.                 These locations             are marked on both the
25 3D    image         and    the   2D    annulus,       and    they    are    re-calculated
   and moved as the ablation lesions grow.
             In      a   disclosed        embodiment,          the    dimensions             of      any
   given         ablation        lesion       is    calculated        by    the      processor,
   using         measurements          of    force      exerted      by   the      tip        of    the
30 catheter,            the    radio-frequency           power     emitted      from the             tip
                                                        7
             3447779v1

   of the catheter,              and the elapsed time                     for the lesion.                In
   a   successful           ablation           procedure,              the     surgeon          sees        a
   contiguous      chain of calculated images of ablation                                       lesions
   growing    around         the pulmonary              vein,        until     a   complete          ring
 5 of  ablation        lesions         has      been      formed.            The    visualization
   of both    the progress               and     the     completeness            of    the     ring      of
   calculated          images           of       ablation             lesions          is       greatly
   facilitated        by       the     display          of     the       2D   annulus,          as     the
   entire ablated region can be seen at once.

         Fig.     1    is      a    schematic          illustration             of     an     invasive
   medical     procedure            using        apparatus             12,    according           to     an
   embodiment       of      the      present         invention.              The     procedure           is
   performed      by      a    surgeon         14,     and,      by     way    of    example,          the
15 procedure      in      the      description             hereinbelow           is      assumed         to
   comprise     ablation           of   a portion           of     a    pulmonary        vein       16   of
   a  heart    46    of      a   human       patient         18.         However,       it     will     be
   understood       that       embodiments            of     the     present       invention           are
   not  just     applicable            to     this      specific           procedure,          and     may
20 include substantially any procedure on biological tissue.
         In order to perform the                        ablation,           surgeon 14          inserts
   a  probe    20,       typically           a    catheter,            into    a    lumen        of    the
   patient,      so     that       a    distal        end      22      of    the     probe       enters
   pulmonary       vein          16     of      the       patient.              Distal         end       22
25 comprises      electrodes             24      mounted          on     the    outside         of     the
   distal      end,           the        electrodes               contacting             respective
   locations      of      pulmonary           vein      16.          A   proximal        end      28     of
   probe 20     is coupled to a console 32 of apparatus 12.

         3447779v1

             Apparatus         12     is     controlled         by    a    processor          30,     which
   is    located in           console          32.      Console        32    comprises          controls
   34     which       are      used        by     surgeon         14     to     communicate             with
   processor            30.            During          the     procedure,             processor              30
 5 typically          tracks       a     location         and    an    orientation            of    distal
   end     22     of   the    probe,          using       any   method        known      in     the     art.
   For      example,         processor            30     may    use      a    magnetic          tracking
   method, wherein magnetic transmitters external                                           to patient
   18    generate        signals          in coils positioned in distal end 22.
10 The       Carto®        system          produced           by     Biosense           Webster,             of
   Diamond Bar, CA, uses such a tracking method.
             The     software         for      processor         30    may      be    downloaded             to

   example.           Alternatively               or additionally, the software may
15 be     provided         on     non-transitory                tangible           media,        such        as
   optical,            magnetic,                or       electronic              storage            media.
   Processor          30   is    coupled to             a   display        screen       36,     which        is
   divided into a left display 38                             and a right display 40,                        as
   is     detailed        below.          While       for    simplicity            the     description
20 herein assumes that the                        screen is divided into a left                            and
   a   right       display,        it     will      be    understood          that      the     scope        of
   the       present         invention             includes          any       other        convenient
   method        for    screen        division          and    image      display,          such      as     an
   upper and lower display, or a first screen and a separate
25 second screen.
             In     order       to       operate          apparatus           12,      processor             30
   communicates            with       electronics            42,     which       has     a    number         of
