Description for 'Book A Look' by Valentina LEVAK.
'Book A Look' will be a downloaded application that will give its users access to a digital
platform where make-up artists, eyebrow and eye lash specialists, skin and wax specialists,
nail artists, hair dressers/stylists/barbers and massage therapists will display their services
and instant availability. The users and service providers will be able to organise where the
specified service is to be carried i.e. service providers home or users home.
Service providers and users will be rated by one another for quality control. Both user and
service provider will have control of their profile. They will be able to upload digital imagery
of their work and their instant availability via the in-built calendar. The service providers will
also be able to display their preferred products and brands which will be a form of
advertisement throughout the application.
All the products service providers use will be hyperlinked so that the user can be easily
directed to a brands product page where they can purchase their desired product. Book A
Look will absorb an agreed fee from every purchase.
Location services will be utilised so that the user or the service provider can be easily
located. The services will be conducted in the privacy of either parties home or agreed
location.
Registered service providers will be able to simply register their services with the application
as well as the users will be able to simply register for use of the application. Both the service
providers and users will be rated on the application.
No cash will be exchanged by either the service provider or the user rather it will be online
digital transfers utilising services such as Paypal etc. The service will deduct a fee for access
to the platform as well as any advertising for beauty products which may displayed
throughout the application.
