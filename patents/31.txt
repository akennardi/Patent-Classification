         BINDING MACHINE AND AUXILIARY MEMBER FOR BINDING
                                          MACHINE
   TECHNICAL FIELD
 5 [0001] The disclosure relates to a binding machine and an auxiliary member for
   binding machine.
   BACKGROUND
   [0002] For example, a binding machine is used to bind a binding target such as
 0 reinforcing bars at a construction site (refer to Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent
   No. 5,126,101B).
   [0003] When the binding machine is used, since it is possible to securely speed up
   an operation, it is expected that the spread of the binding machine will be
   increased.
 5 [0004] The binding machine has a curl guide configured to guide a wire in a loop
   shape around the binding target.
   [0005] However, according to the binding machine of the related art, when
   binding the binding target put on a ground, for example, it takes time because it is
   necessary to lift the binding target put on the ground with a hand opposite to a
 o hand holding the binding machine.
                                         SUMMARY
   [0006] It is therefore an object of the disclosure to mainly solve the above
   problem.
25 [0007] In order to solve the above problem, the disclosure provides a binding
   machine including a curl guide configured to guide a wire in a loop shape around a
   binding target, and a twisting part configured to bind the binding target by
   twisting the wire guided in the loop shape around the binding target, wherein the
   curl guide has a tapered protrusion at a tip end-side.
30 [0008] According to the disclosure, since the tapered protrusion is provided at the
   tip end-side of the curl guide, it is possible to scoop up (lift) the binding target put
   on a ground, for example.       Therefore, when binding the binding target, it is
                                                1

   possible to omit the labor of lifting the binding target with a hand opposite to a
   hand carrying the binding machine.

                               DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0010] Hereinafter, embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the
   drawings.    FIGS. 1 to 25C depict the embodiments.
30 [Embodiment 1]
   [0011] <Configuration>
           In the below, a configuration of the embodiment is described.
                                              4

   [0012] FIG. 1 depicts a binding machine 1.      In FIG. 1, arrows indicate a front and
   back direction 2, a height direction 3, and a width direction 4 of the binding
   machine 1.    A direction in which a main body (binding machine main body 5) of
   the binding machine 1 extends is the front and back direction 2.        A side of the
 5 binding machine 1 facing toward the binding target 6 is a front side of the front
   and back direction 2.      In FIG. 1, the height direction 3 is an upper and lower
   direction.   The width direction 4 is a direction perpendicular to the drawing sheet.
   An intermediate part of the binding machine main body 5 in the front and back
   direction 2 is provided with a gripping part (grip) 7 substantially extending
 0 downward.     An upper part of the gripping part 7 is provided with a trigger switch
   8.   When the trigger switch 8 is pulled at a state where a power supply is ON, the
   binding machine 1 is operated.
   [0013] A wire 9 for binding the binding target 6 is wound on a reel (wire reel) 11.
   The reel 11 has a shaft part 11a, and flange parts 1Ib provided at both end portions
 5 of the shaft part 11a in the width direction 4.
   [0014] A rear part of the binding machine main body 5 is provided with a
   mounting part (a reel mounting part) 12 capable of rotatably mounting the reel 11
   thereto.   However, a position of the mounting part 12 is not limited to the rear
   part of the binding machine main body 5.       The mounting part 12 is provided with
 0 a brake member 13 configured to restrain rotation of the reel 11.           The brake
   member 13 is configured to brake the rotation of the reel 11 at a time point at
   which the feeding of the wire 9 ends, for example.      In this case, the flange parts
   1lb of the reel 11 are configured as a ratchet gear and the brake member 13 is
   configured as a claw part to be meshed with the ratchet gear, so that the rotation of
25 the reel 11 in one direction (a direction in which the wire 9 is to be pulled out) and
   reverse rotation thereof by one tooth of the ratchet gear are allowed.
   [0015] The wire 9 pulled out from the reel 11 mounted to the mounting part 12 is
   sent to a front side of the binding machine main body 5 by a wire feeding part (a
   wire feeding mechanism) 15.      The wire feeding part 15 includes an electric motor
30 (a feeding motor) 16 and feeding rollers 17 to be driven by the electric motor 16.
   The feeding rollers 17 are configured by a pair of right and left feeding gears
   having a gear shape.      The wire 9 is sent forward by rotations of the pair of
                                               5

   feeding rollers 17 at a state where the wire has passed between the pair of feeding
   rollers 17.
   [0016] A front end portion of the binding machine main body 5 is provided with
   curl guides 21, 22 configured to curl the wire 9 and to guide the same in a loop
 5 shape around the binding target 6.    The wire 9 is enabled to circulate one or more
   times around the binding target 6 by the curl guides 21, 22.
   [0017] The curl guides 21, 22 are provided as a pair with an interval in the height
   direction 3 (the upper and lower direction).     An opening (insertion part) 23 for
   inserting therein the binding target 6 is formed with an interval between tip end
 0 portions of the pair of upper and lower curl guides 21, 22.    The upper curl guide
   21 is a fixed curl guide.   The lower curl guide 22 may be fixed or moveable.     In
   the embodiment, the lower curl guide 22 is configured as a moveable curl guide.
   The curl guides 21, 22 will be described later.
   [0018] As shown in FIG. 2, the binding machine main body 5 is provided with a
 5 twisting part 24 configured to perform the binding by twisting the wire 9 wound in
   the loop shape around the binding target 6 to reduce a diameter of the loop.     The
   twisting part 24 includes a twisting mechanism 26 having a shaft 25 extending in
   the front and back direction 2,       and an electric motor 27 (twisting motor)
   configured to rotatively drive the shaft 25 of the twisting mechanism 26.
 0 [0019] The twisting mechanism 26 includes a pair of hook parts 28 provided at a
   tip end-side of the shaft 25 and configured to grip and open a portion of the wire 9
   of the loop shape, and a sleeve 29 to be screwed to a screw part provided on an
   outer periphery of the shaft 25.     When the shaft 25 is rotated by the electric
   motor 27, the sleeve 29 is moved forward or backward or rotated with respect to
25 the shaft 25, so that the hook parts 28 are enabled to perform gripping/opening
   movement, movement in forward or backward direction or rotational movement.
   [0020] The diverse driving devices such as the electric motor 16, the electric
   motor 27 and the like mounted to the binding machine              1 are sequentially
   controlled by a control circuit.
30 [0021] As shown in FIG. 3, at least the upper curl guide 21 of the upper and lower
   curl guides 21, 22 has a substantially C-shaped or U-shaped section opening
   downward and having an outer periphery-side surface 32 (outer periphery wall
                                              6

   part) having a shape substantially conforming to a locus 31 (refer to FIG. 2) for
   circulating the wire 9 in the loop shape and a pair of right and left side surfaces 33,
   34 (sidewall parts) erected from both sides of the outer periphery-side surface 32
   toward an inner side of the locus 31.         The outer periphery-side surface 32 is
 5 configured to guide the wire 9 in the loop shape, and the pair of right and left side
   surfaces 33, 34 is configured to guide and keep the wire 9 circulating in the loop
   shape from sides.
   [0022] Like the upper curl guide 21,         the lower curl guide 22 may have a
   substantially C-shaped or U-shaped section opening upward and having an outer
 o periphery-side surface (outer periphery wall part), and a pair of right and left side
   surfaces (sidewall parts) erected from both sides of the outer periphery-side
   surface.
   [0023] As shown in FIG. 4, the upper curl guide 21 has a linear part 36 extending
   in the front and back direction 2 and a curved part 37 provided at a tip end-side of
 5 the linear part 36, as seen from a side (the width direction 4).    The curved part 37
   has a circular arc shape substantially conforming to the locus 31 for circulating the
   wire 9 in the loop shape, for example.
   [0024] In the upper curl guide 21, a guide member 41 configured to guide forward
   the wire 9 extends up to a front side of the curved part 37, and a cutting part (a
 0 cutter mechanism) 42 configured to cut the wire 9 to a necessary length is
   provided in front of the guide member 41.        In the curved part 37, a curl plate 43
   configured to reform and curl the wire 9 is provided in front of the cutting part 42.
   In addition, the upper curl guide 21 is provided therein with a wire guide member
   44 for guiding the wire 9 along the locus 31 for circulating the same in the loop
25 shape, and the like.     The wire guide member 44 is configured as a member for
   wear prevention, such as a carbide pin, a ceramic pin or the like extending in the
   width direction 4.    The wire guide member 44 is provided in a singular or plural
   number.
   [0025] In the embodiment, an auxiliary member 61 for binding machine (for
30 example, FIGS. 1OA and 10B) is provided to the binding machine 1, as shown in
   FIGS. 5 to 7, and can be used as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9.             In the below, the
   binding machine      1 having the auxiliary member 61 for binding machine             is
                                               7

   described.
   [0026] (1) As shown in FIG. 9 (or FIG. 6) and the like, the binding machine 1
   includes the curl guides 21, 22 configured to guide the wire 9 in the loop shape
   around the binding target 6, and the twisting part 24 configured to bind the
 5 binding target 6 by twisting the wire 9 guided in the loop shape around the binding
   target 6.   The curl guides 21, 22 have a tapered protrusion 62 at a tip end-side.
   [0027] Herein, the auxiliary member 61 for binding machine is a member
   (attachment) that is to be used for the binding machine 1 in an auxiliary manner
   and can add a new function to the binding machine 1.         The auxiliary member 61
 0 for binding machine is made of metal or the like.          In this case, the auxiliary
   member 61 for binding machine is configured as a scoop-up member capable of
   scooping up (or lifting) the binding target 6, which is arranged to be in contact
   with a contact surface 63, without using a hand.
   [0028] In the drawings, the auxiliary member 61 for binding machine is mounted
 5 to the upper curl guide 21.     In the below, the configuration where the auxiliary
   member 61 is mounted to the upper curl guide 21 is mainly described.         However,
   as described later, the auxiliary member 61 for binding machine may be mounted
   to the lower curl guide 22.   Meanwhile, in the drawings, the auxiliary member 61
   for binding machine is configured as a member different from the binding machine
 0 1.   However, a structure and a function of the auxiliary member 61 for binding
   machine may be integrally incorporated to the binding machine 1, depending on
   situations.
   [0029] The protrusion 62 is a part that protrudes beyond the tip end portions of the
   curl guides 21, 22 when using the auxiliary member 61 for binding machine.
25 [0030] The tapered shape is a pointed shape such as a claw shape, a beak shape
   and the like.    The tapered shape may be any shape inasmuch as a tip of the
   protrusion 62 is thinned.   For example, the tapered shape may include a variety of
   states such as a state where the tip of the protrusion 62 is thinned as seen in the
   front and back direction 2, a state where the tip is thinned as seen in the height
30 direction 3, a state where the tip is thinned as seen in the width direction 4, a state
   where a thickness of the protrusion 62 gradually decreases and the tip is thus
   thinned, and the like.
                                               8

   [003 1]The binding target 6 may be a rod-shaped member such as a reinforcing bar,
   for example.      When constructing      a floor heating,      the binding target 6     is
   configured of a pipe member 6a such as a pipe for heating or the like and a rod
   shaped member 6b such as a mesh bar, for example.
 5 [0032] (2) The protrusion 62 has a guide part 64 provided on an outer periphery
   side thereof and arranged substantially perpendicularly to an extension line 25a of
   the shaft 25 of the twisting part 24.
   [0033] Herein, the guide part 64 is preferably configured to be moveable along the
   contact surface 63 with which the binding target 6 is arranged to be in substantial
 0 contact (the moveable guide part).       The contact surface 63 may be any surface
   inasmuch as it is a surface on which the binding target 6 is arranged to be in
   substantial contact.    The contact surface 63 may be a horizontal surface such as a
   floor, a vertical surface such as a wall, and the other surfaces (an inclined surface
   and the like), for example.        When constructing a floor heating, the contact
 5 surface 63 is a horizontal surface (floor surface) such as a concrete floor.         The
   pipe for heating and the mesh bar are directly placed with being vertically
   superimposed on the concrete floor.          However, the binding target 6 may be
   arranged with being slightly floated from the contact surface 63.       In this case, the
   contact surface 63 is a placement surface on which the binding target 6 is arranged.
 0 In the below, it is assumed that the contact surface 63 includes the placement
   surface of the binding target 6.
   [0034] In other words, the curl guides 21, 22 have the tapered protrusion 62
   formed to be thinned toward the tip end-side, as seen in a first direction (width
   direction 4) perpendicular to the extension line 25a of the shaft 25 of the twisting
25 part 24, and the protrusion 62 has the guide part 64 configuring an outer surface,
   as seen in the first direction (width direction 4).     The guide part 64 is configured
   as a surface perpendicular to the extension line 25a and substantially conforming
   to a second direction (height direction 3) perpendicular to the first direction
   (width direction 4).    In this case, the first direction is the width direction 4 but is
30 not limited thereto.
   [0035] The description "substantially perpendicular" indicates that the guide part
   64 and the extension line 25a of the shaft 25 are substantially perpendicular to
                                                 9

   each other but an error of about ±80 is allowed.      However, preferably, about   ±50,
   and more preferably, about     ±3'  is set.   The guide part 64 is preferably set to a
   length or longer within which it actually intersects with the extension line 25a of
   the shaft 25.
 5 [0036] (3)  As shown in FIG. 11, the protrusion 62 may be configured to be
   detachably mounted to the curl guides 21, 22 or the binding machine main body 5
   configured to support the curl guides 21, 22 (the detachable protrusion).
   [0037] Herein, according to the binding machine of the related art, when binding a
   binding target put on a ground, for example, the curl guide may collide with the
 o ground and may be thus damaged.          In this case, the binding machine should be
   disassembled to replace the curl guide, which takes labor.       Therefore, in order to
   prevent the damage of the curl guides 21, 22, the detachable protrusion 62
   configured to be mounted and demounted to and from the binding machine 1 is
   provided.     The mounting and demounting of the protrusion 62 to and from the
 5 curl guides 21, 22 or the binding machine 1 can be performed using a dedicated
   fixing tool 67 or the like.   The dedicated fixing tool 67 may be a screw or the like.
   The dedicated fixing tool 67 (a screw or the like) may be provided in a singular or
   plural number.    In the drawings, the dedicated fixing tool 67 is configured as two
   screws extending in the width direction 4.
 0 [0038] In contrast, when the protrusion 62 is directly fixed to the curl guides 21,
   22 or the binding machine 1 by welding or adhesion, it cannot be detachable.
   [0039] As described above, the guide part 64 is a part becoming a guide of the
   binding machine 1.      The guide part 64 is a guide part that enables the protrusion
   62 to smoothly move with the binding machine 1 by moving the guide part in a
25 longitudinal direction with keeping a contact state of two or more points with the
   contact surface 63.    Specifically, the guide part may be configured as follows.
   [0040] (4) The guide part 64 is preferably configured as a planar surface.          For
   example, as shown in FIG. 24A, the guide part 64 may be configured by a linear
   guide part (or a planar guide part) 64a, which is substantially linear, as seen from
30 a side.
   [0041] (5)  The guide part 64 may be configured as a planar surface having a
   convex portion or a concave portion.         For example, the guide part 64 may be
                                                10

   configured by a concavo-convex guide part 64b having a concavo-convex portion
   shown in FIG. 24B, as seen from a side, a two-point-like guide part 64c having
   two projections shown in FIG. 24C, as seen from a side, or the like provided for
   the linear guide part (or a planar guide part) 64a shown in FIG. 24A.     The convex
 5 portions of the guide part 64 are preferably configured so that apexes are linearly
   aligned side by side, as seen from a side.     A direction of the convex portions may
   be the width direction 4 of the binding machine main body 5, as shown in FIG.
   24B, or the front and back direction 2, the extension direction (protrusion
   direction) of the protrusion 62 or the like, like a plurality of concave recesses 64e
 0 shown in FIG. 10A.      In this way, the guide part 64 is configured by the concavo
   convex guide part 64b, the two-point-like guide part 64c, the concave recesses 64e
   or the like, so that it is possible to reduce a frictional resistance by reducing a
   contact area with the contact surface 63.
   [0042] (6) The guide part 64 may be configured as a curved surface approximate
 5 to a planar surface.    For example, as shown in FIG. 24D, the guide part 64 may
   be configured by a gently curved guide part 64d, which has a large radius of
   curvature and is similar to the linear guide part 64a shown in FIG. 24A.
   [0043] The guide part 64 may be provided within a range greater than the tip end
   portion of the outer periphery-side of the protrusion 62.        In the meantime, for
 o example, a part that has a linear part at the outer periphery-side but cannot be used
   as the guide part is excluded from the guide part 64.
   [0044] In this case, a protrusion length of the protrusion 62 having the guide part
   64 at the tip end portion of the outer periphery-side is a distance from a position
   of the tip end portion of the curl guides 21, 22 to the tip end portion (of the guide
25 part 64) beyond a position       intersecting with the extension line 25a.        The
   protrusion 62 is preferably set to have a length within which it is possible to
   sufficiently secure an opening 23a for inserting the binding target 6 between the
   protrusion and the tip end of the opposite one of the curl guides 21, 22.       In the
   meantime, the opening 23 between the tip end portions of the curl guides 21, 22
30 becomes an opening 23a narrower than the opening 23 as the auxiliary member 61
   for binding machine is mounted.
   [0045] (7) The protrusion 62 may be configured to have a pointed tip end and may
                                               11

   be provided at an inner periphery-side opposite to the guide part 64 with an
   inclined guide part 65 for guiding the binding target 6 from a tip end-side toward a
   base end-side.
   [0046] Herein, the description "pointed tip end" indicates a side surface shape of
 5 the protrusion 62 configured by the guide part 64 and the guide part 65 when the
   binding machine 1 is seen from a side (the width direction 4).     The guide part 65
   may be configured to have a continuous constant inclination shape from a tip end
   side toward a base end-side so as to smoothly pass between an inside and an
   outside   of the loop-shaped    locus 31   of the wire 9,    for example.     In the
 o embodiment, the guide part 65 is set as an inclination part inclined relative to the
   guide part 64 by about 15' to 30' and having a substantially linear shape or a
   curved shape close to a straight line.
   [0047] (7-1)   The guide part 65 is configured to have a boundary part 65p at a
   position beyond the extension line 25a of the shaft 25 of the twisting part 24.
 5 The boundary part 65p guides the binding target 6 from the outside toward the
   inside of the locus 31 of the wire 5.
   [0048] That is, the guide part 65 has a shape having a part 65a positioned outside
   the loop-shaped locus 31 of the wire 9 at the tip end-side of the continuous
   constant inclination shape part and a part 65b positioned inside the loop-shaped
 0 locus 31 of the wire 9 at the base end-side (a side facing toward the binding
   machine main body 5) and passing between the inside and the outside of the loop
   shaped locus 31 of the wire 9.
   [0049] A side of the guide part 65 closer to the tip-end side than the boundary part
   65p becomes the part 65a positioned outside the locus 31 of the wire 9, and a side
25 (a side facing toward the binding machine main body 5) of the guide part 65 closer
   to the base end-side than the boundary part 65p becomes the part 65b positioned
   inside the locus 31 of the wire 9.
   [0050] A tip end portion 65c (of the continuous constant inclination shape part) of
   the guide part 65, which is positioned at the tip end of the tapered protrusion 62,
30 may be configured as a corner portion intersecting with the guide part 64 at an
   acute angle, a round portion obtained by rounding the corner portion, a step
   portion   obtained  by notching     the corner  portion   or  the  like.   However,
                                             12

   (particularly, when the tip end portion is configured as a step portion or the like),
   a distance (step amount) between the tip end portion 65c of the guide part 65 and
   the guide part 64 in the front and back direction 2 of the binding machine main
   body 5 is preferably set to a height (for example, a height equal to or smaller than
 5 about a radius of the binding target 6: 8mm or the like) within a range in which the
   tip end portion 65c of the guide part 65 can be inserted at least between the
   binding target 6 and the contact surface 63 without difficulty and there occurs no
   problem, which is caused as the tip end portion 65c of the guide part 65 collides
   with the binding target 6.    The tip end portion 65c of the guide part 65 is set to
 o the above height, so that it is possible to smoothly guide the binding target to the
   continuous constant inclination shape part of the guide part 65.
   [0051] In this case, since the protrusion 62 is preferably configured to insert the
   tip end thereof between the binding target 6 and the contact surface 63, (a length
   in the extension direction of the protrusion 62 of) the part 65a positioned outside
 5 the loop-shaped locus 31 of the wire 9 located at the tip end-side of the guide part
   65 is made to be short.   However, the part 65a positioned outside the loop-shaped
   locus 31 of the wire 9 located at the tip end-side may be made to be long by
   lengthening the guide part 64.     In the meantime, structurally, the boundary part
   65p of the guide part 65 may be set at a position not exceeding the extension line
 0 25a.
   [0052] As shown in each embodiment of FIGS. 12A to 15B (mainly, refer to FIGS.
   12A and 12B), the protrusion 62 may be mounted to be displaceable relative to the
   curl guides 21, 22 (a replaceable protrusion).
   [0053] The description "displaceable"      indicates that the protrusion 62 can be
25 mounted with a position thereof being changed relative to the curl guides 21, 22.
   Alternatively, the description "displaceable"      indicates that a position of the
   protrusion 62 can be changed with being mounted to the curl guides 21, 22.       The
   position change can be implemented by additionally forming the protrusion 62
   with screw holes 69 of which the number is greater than the number of the
30 dedicated fixing tools 67 and configuring any one of the screw holes 69 to be
   selectively useable for fixing, as shown in FIGS. 12A and 12B (or FIGS. 13A and
   13B), for example.     Meanwhile, in the embodiment of FIGS. 12A and 12B, the
                                               13

   protrusion 62 is configured so that it can be displaced in the substantially vertical
   direction.   Also, in the embodiment of FIGS. 13A and 13B, the protrusion 62 is
   configured so that it can be displaced in the substantially front and back direction.
   [0054] (8-1) As shown in an embodiment of FIGS. 14A and 14B (or FIGS. 15A
 5 and 15B), the protrusion 62 may be mounted to be rotatable relative to the curl
   guides 21, 22 (a rotatable protrusion).
   [0055] The description "rotatable" indicates that a position of the protrusion 62
   can be changed by moving the same in a circular arc shape or the like with the
   protrusion 62 being mounted to the curl guides 21, 22.         In order to move the
 o protrusion 62 in the circular arc shape, one dedicated fixing tool 67 may be
   provided, the screw hole 69 of the auxiliary member 61 for binding machine may
   be formed as a circular arc-shaped long hole 69a, and the protrusion 62 may be
   moved in a circular arc shape along the circular arc-shaped long hole 69a, as
   shown in the embodiment of FIGS. 14A and 14B, for example.           In this case, the
 5 protrusion 62 is configured so that it can be largely rotatively displaced in the
   substantially front and back direction.
   [0056] Also, as shown in an embodiment of FIGS. 15A and 15B, the two dedicated
   fixing tools 67 may be provided, one of the dedicated fixing tools may be
   configured as a rotation shaft 67a and the other may be configured as a guide shaft
 0 67b, the screw hole 69 of the auxiliary member 61 for binding machine provided
   at the rotation shaft 67a-side may be formed as a circular hole, the screw hole 69
   provided at the guide shaft 67b-side may be formed as a circular arc-shaped long
   hole 69a of which a center is a position of the rotation shaft 67a, and the
   protrusion 62 may be moved along the circular arc-shaped long hole 69a.        In this
25 case, the protrusion 62 is configured so that it can be rotatively displaced in the
   substantially vertical direction.
   [0057] (8-2) The protrusion 62 may be mounted to be slidable relative to the curl
   guides 21, 22 (a slidable protrusion).
   [0058] The description "slidable" indicates that a position of the protrusion 62 can
30 be changed by linearly or curvedly moving (sliding) the same with the protrusion
   62 being mounted to the curl guides 21, 22.          In order to linearly move the
   protrusion 62, the protrusion 62 is provided with a linear long hole (slide hole) as
                                              14

   the screw hole 69, for example.     For instance, in the embodiment of FIGS. 12A
   and 12B (or FIGS. 13A and 13B), the screw hole may be formed as a long hole
   (slide hole) connecting the screw holes 69 therebetween before and after the
   movement.
 5 [0059] Also, in order to curvedly slide and move the protrusion 62, the large
   circular arc-shaped long hole 69a may be provided along a movement path, like
   the embodiment of FIGS. 14A and 14B.
   [0060] (8-3) As shown in FIG. 1, the curl guides 21, 22 have the opening 23 in
   which the binding target 6 can be inserted.   As shown in the embodiment of FIGS.
 0 13A and 13B (or FIGS. 15A and 15B), the protrusion 62 may be mounted so that a
   size of the opening 23 can be changed.
   [0061] Herein, as described above, the opening 23 between the tip end portions of
   the curl guides 21, 22 becomes the opening 23a between the tip end portions of the
   curl guides 21, 22 and the protrusion 62 by mounting the auxiliary member 61 for
 5 binding machine to the curl guides 21, 22.
   [0062] In order to change the size of the opening 23a, the protrusion 62 may be
   mounted so that it can be displaced (linearly) forward relative to the binding
   machine main body 5, as shown in the embodiment of FIGS. 13A and 13B.         Also,
   as shown in the embodiment of FIGS. 15A and 15B, the protrusion 62 may be
 o mounted so that it can be rotatable in a direction getting away from the opposite
   one of the curl guides 21, 22.
   [0063] Meanwhile, in the embodiment of FIGS. 12A and 12B or the embodiment
   of FIGS. 14A and 14B, the size of the opening 23a can be changed.      However, the
   corresponding embodiment is mainly configured to be switched to one of an aspect
25 where the auxiliary member 61 for binding machine is used and an aspect where
   the auxiliary member 61 for binding machine is not used.
   [0064] (9)   As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 11,          a protection part 71
   configured to be continuous to the protrusion 62 and to cover at least a part of the
   outer surfaces of the curl guides 21, 22 from an outside may be provided.
30 [0065] Herein, the protection part 71 is a part configured to cover at least the
   outer surfaces of the tip end portions of the curl guides 21, 22 from the outside.
   The protection part 71 is preferably provided integrally with the protrusion 62 at a
                                              15

   base part of the protrusion 62.     The protection part 71 may be used as a mounting
   part 72 of the protrusion 62 to the curl guides 21, 22 or the like.       On the other
   hand, the mounting part 72 may be provided separately from the protection part 71.
   [0066] That is, during the binding operation, when the curl guides 21, 22 collide
 5 with the binding target 6, the ground, a wall or the like, the curl guides 21, 22 may
   be damaged.     Thereby, a malfunction such as a curl formation defect of the wire 9,
   a jamming of the wire 9 and the like may be caused.         Therefore, for example, as
   shown in FIGS. 25A to 25C, when the protection part 71 configured to protect
   surfaces including the tip end portions of the curl guides 21, 22 is provided, it is
 o possible to protect the damage of the curl guides 21, 22 and to prolong the lifetime
   of the curl guides 21, 22.
   [0067] Also, in this embodiment, the protection part 71 is arranged at a position
   including the surface for protecting the tip end portions of the curl guides 21, 22.
   However, the protection part 71 may be appropriately arranged at the tip end
 5 portions of the curl guides 21, 22, the outer peripheral surfaces thereof or the like.
   [0068] In the meantime,      structurally, the protection part 71 may be directly
   provided with the guide part 64 such as a linear guide part 64a having a linear
   portion, as shown in FIG. 25A, a concavo-convex guide part 64b having a
   concavo-convex portion, as shown in FIG. 25B, or a two-point-like guide part 64c
 0 having two-point protrusions, as shown in FIG. 25C.        In the below, the protection
   part 71 is described in detail.
   [0069] (9-1) The protection part 71 may have a protection surface 73 configured to
   protect at least one of surfaces (an outer periphery-side surface 32 and both side
   surfaces 33, 34) configuring the curl guides 21, 22.
25 [0070] Herein, the protection surface 73 is at least one of the surfaces configuring
   the curl guides 21, 22.    That is, for example, the protection surface 73 may be the
   outer periphery-side surface 32 of the curl guides 21, 22.       The protection surface
   73 may be the right side surface 33 of the curl guides 21, 22.          The protection
   surface 73 may be the left side surface 34 of the curl guides 21, 22.        Preferably,
30 following configurations are possible.
   [0071] (10)   More specifically, as shown in an embodiment of FIG. 16, the
   protection part 71 may have an outer periphery protection surface 73a configured
                                               16

   to cover the outer periphery-side surface 32 of the outer surfaces of the curl guides
   21, 22.
   [0072] Herein, the protection part 71 has only the outer periphery protection
   surface 73a to protect at least a part of one surface of the curl guides 21, 22.  The
 5 outer periphery protection surface 73a has a curved and substantial band shape
   having a width size, which is equal to or slightly greater than the outer periphery
   side surface 32 of the curl guides 21, 22, and extending along the outer periphery
   side surface 32.    In this case, the protrusion 62 may be configured to have only
   an outer periphery constituting surface 62a extending integrally from the outer
 0 periphery protection surface 73a.
   [0073] (11)  As shown in an embodiment of FIG. 17, the protection part 71 may
   have an outer periphery protection surface 73a configured to cover the outer
   periphery-side surface 32 of the outer surfaces of the curl guides 21, 22 and a side
   surface protection surface 73b configured to cover one of the side surfaces 33, 34
 5 of the curl guides 21, 22.
   [0074] Herein, the protection part 71 is configured to protect at least a part of two
   surfaces of the curl guides 21, 22 by the outer periphery protection surface 73a
   and one side surface protection surface 73b.      The side surface protection surface
   73b may be configured to cover the right side surface 33.            The side surface
 o protection surface 73b may be configured to cover the left side surface 34.         In
   this embodiment, the side surface protection surface 73b covers the left side
   surface 34.    In this case, the protrusion 62 may be configured to have an L
   shaped section having an outer periphery constituting surface 62a extending from
   the outer periphery protection surface 73a and a side constituting surface 62b
25 extending from one side surface protection surface 73b.
   [0075] (12) As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 11, the protection part 71 may be
   configured to have a C-shaped or U-shaped section part having the outer periphery
   protection surface 73a configured to cover the outer periphery-side surface 32 of
   the outer surfaces of the curl guides 21, 22 and a pair of side surface protection
30 surfaces 73b, 73b configured to cover both the side surfaces 33, 34.
   [0076] Herein, the protection part 71 is configured to protect at least a part of
   three surfaces of the curl guides 21, 22 by the outer periphery protection surface
                                               17

   73a and the pair of side surface protection surfaces 73b, 73b.      In this case, the
   protrusion 62 may be configured to have a C-shaped or U-shaped section having
   an outer periphery constituting surface 62a extending from the outer periphery
   protection surface 73a and a pair of side constituting surfaces 62b, 62b extending
 5 from both the side surface protection surfaces 73b, 73b.
   [0077] (13) For example, as shown in the embodiment of FIG. 16, the protrusion
   62 may have an outer periphery constituting surface 62a configuring an outer
   periphery-side surface, and the outer periphery constituting surface 62a may have
   a width-narrowed part 75 of which a width gradually decreases toward a tip end
 o side.
   [0078] (14) The protrusion 62 may have a pair of side constituting surfaces 62b,
   62b configuring side surfaces, and the width-narrowed part 75 may have a shape
   tapered toward one side constituting surface 62b.
   [0079] (15) The protrusion 62 may have a pair of side constituting surfaces 62b,
 5 62b configuring side surfaces, and the side constituting surfaces 62b, 62b may
   have a shape tapered toward a tip end-side.
   [0080] Herein, the width-narrowed part 75 is a part formed by tapering a width of
   the tip end portion of the protrusion 62.       The width-narrowed part 75 may be a
   part formed by narrowing a width of the outer periphery constituting surface 62a
 o toward the tip end-side.    In this case, the width-narrowed part 75 is a part (one
   side inclined part) formed by inclining the outer periphery constituting surface 62a
   in a tapered shape toward the left side surface 34.
   [0081] Also, for example, as shown in an embodiment of FIGS. 18A and 18B, the
   width-narrowed part 75 may be a part formed by narrowing a width of the outer
25 periphery constituting surface 62a and reducing inward the side constituting
   surfaces 62b, 62b in conformity to the tapered shape of the outer periphery
   constituting surface 62a.    In this case, the width-narrowed part 75 is a part (both
   side inclined part) formed by inclining the outer periphery constituting surface 62a
   in a tapered shape toward a width center part.
30 [0082] (16) As shown in an embodiment of FIG. 19, the protrusion 62 may be
   configured to have a mark 81 indicative of a position, through which the wire 9 is
   to pass, on an outer periphery or inner periphery-side surface.
                                                18

   [0083] Herein, the mark 81 is provided at least at a position of the outer periphery
   constituting surface 62a, which can be easily seen (by an operator of the binding
   machine 1).     Any mark 81 may be provided as long as a position through which
   the wire 9 is to pass can be seen by the mark.     The mark 81 may be configured by
 5 a letter, a symbol and the like.   The width-narrowed part 75 can also be used as a
   kind of the mark 81.    Specifically, following configurations are possible.
   [0084] (16-1)   The mark 81 may be configured by a projection portion 81a or a
   concave portion 81b.
   [0085] Herein, the projection portion 81a is a portion protruding outward from the
 0 outer periphery constituting surface 62a.      The concave portion 81b is a portion
   recessed    inward  from   the outer periphery     constituting  surface   62a.    The
   projection portion 81a or the concave portion 81b may have a short point shape.
   As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 19, the projection portion 81a or the concave
   portion 81b may have a long line shape such as a projection, a concave recess
 5 (refer to the concave recess 64e of FIG. 10A, too), or the like.             Also, the
   projection portion 81a or the concave portion 81b may have a shape obtained by
   appropriately   combining linear shapes.       In this embodiment,     the projection
   portion 81a or the concave portion 81b is configured as a projection or a concave
   recess   provided  at a width     intermediate   part between   the   outer periphery
 0 constituting surface 62a of the protrusion 62 and the outer periphery protection
   surface 73a of the protection part 71 and extending in the front and back direction
   2.
   [0086] (16-2) The mark 81 may be provided on the outer periphery-side or inner
   periphery-side of the protrusion 62.
25 [0087] Herein, the mark 81 may be provided (at a position that is easy to see) on
   any one of the outer periphery-side (front surface-side) of the protrusion 62 and
   the inner periphery-side (back surface-side) of the protrusion 62.     Also, the mark
   81 may be provided on both the outer periphery-side of the protrusion 62 and the
   inner periphery-side of the protrusion 62.      For example, the projection portion
30 81a and the concave portion 81b becoming the mark 81 may be provided at the
   same time on both the outer periphery-side of the protrusion 62 and the inner
   periphery-side of the protrusion 62 by performing concavo-convex processing of
                                              19

   making a plate thickness substantially constant for a metal plate configuring the
   protrusion 62.    In this case, one of the projection portion 81a and the concave
   portion 81b is provided on the outer periphery-side of the protrusion 62, and the
   other is provided on the inner periphery-side of the protrusion 62.
 5 [0088] (16-3) As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 11, the protrusion 62 may be
   mounted and fixed to a mounting member 85 provided at a position deviating from
   the locus 31 (refer to FIG. 9) for guiding the wire 9 in the loop shape within the
   curl guides 21, 22.
   [0089] Herein,   the mounting     member    85 may be configured by a metallic
 0 reinforcement plate (a screw receiving plate) having a screw hole 86 in which a
   screw as the dedicated fixing tool 67 is to be screwed, for example.               The
   mounting member 85 is mounted to an inner surface of one side surface 33 of the
   upper curl guide 21, for example.
   [0090] For example, as shown in FIG. 20, the mounting member 85 may be
 5 mounted at a position closer to the inner periphery than a wire guide member 44 (a
   member for wear prevention) between a guide member 41 and a cutting part 42
   within the upper curl guide 21.
   [0091] Alternatively, the mounting member 85 may be mounted to a part 87 shown
   with hatched lines, which is closer to the inner periphery than the guide member
 0 41, within the upper curl guide 21.
   [0092] The above parts are positions through which the wire 9 is not to pass, and
   are also positions avoiding a moveable region of the cutting part 42 and a region
   in which the wire 9 is to be curled by the curl plate 43 and the like.
   [0093] (16-4) As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 11, the protrusion 62 may be
25 mounted to the curl guides 21, 22.      In this case, the curl guides 21, 22 may be
   configured so that at least a part, to which the protrusion 62 is mounted, can be
   replaced.
   [0094] Herein,   as described above,     the curl guides    21,  22    have the outer
   periphery-side surface 32 and the pair of right and left side surfaces 33, 34.     For
30 example, the outer periphery-side surface 32 may be configured as a member
   integrated with the left side surface 34, and a member configuring the right side
   surface 33 may be detachably attached thereto by a fixing tool 89.          The fixing
                                              20

   tool 89 may be configured by a screw extending in the width direction 4, for
   example.
   [0095] The protrusion 62 may be configured so that the protection part 71 or a
   mounting part 72 provided for the protection part 71 is to be mounted to one side
 5 surface 33 of the curl guides 21, 22 by using the dedicated fixing tool 67 (screw)
   or the like.
   [0096] In this way, the curl guides 21, 22 can be demounted and replaced from the
   binding    machine   main   body    5  with   the  protrusion   62   being   mounted.
   Alternatively, the protrusion 62 can be demounted and replaced from the binding
 0 machine main body 5 with being mounted to the curl guides 21, 22.
   [0097] Also, when the fixing tool 89 is unfastened with the dedicated fixing tool
   67 (screw) being screwed, one side surface 33 can be demounted from the other
   parts (the outer periphery-side surface 32 and the left side surface 34) of the curl
   guides 21, 22 fixed to the binding machine main body 5,            together with the
 5 protrusion 62.    Alternatively, the protrusion 62 can be demounted and replaced
   from the other parts (the outer periphery-side surface 32 and the left side surface
   34) of the curl guides 21, 22 with being mounted to one side surface 33, together
   with the one side surface 33.
   [0098] (16-5) As shown in an embodiment of FIGS. 21A and 21B, the protrusion
 0 62 may be made to extend from the binding machine main body 5 configured to
   support the curl guides 21, 22.
   [0099] Herein, the description "extending from the binding machine main body 5"
   indicates that the protrusion 62 is provided at a tip end portion of a part extending
   from the binding machine main body 5.       Alternatively, the description "extending
25 from the binding machine main body 5" indicates a state where the protection part
   71 integrally provided at the base end-side (a side facing toward the binding
   machine main body 5) of the protrusion 62 covers the entire curl guides 21, 22,
   extends to reach the binding machine main body 5 and is directly mounted to the
   binding machine main body 5 and thus the protrusion extends from the binding
30 machine main body 5.
   [0100] In this embodiment, the protection part 71 has a C-shaped or U-shaped
   section having the outer periphery protection surface 73a and a pair of side surface
                                              21

   protection surfaces 73b and covers the entire upper curl guide 21.
   [0101] Also, the protrusion 62 is mounted so that a base part of the protection part
   71 can be vertically rotatable relative to the binding machine main body 5 by the
   rotation shaft 67a extending in the width direction 4.      Thereby, it is possible to
 5 change a shape of the binding machine 1 to any one of a state where there is the
   protrusion 62 and a state where there is no the protrusion 62.
   [0102] Furthermore, the protrusion 62 has the width-narrowed part 75 on the outer
   periphery constituting surface 62a.
   [0103] (17) The protrusion 62 may be provided on at least one side surface 33 or
 o side surface 34 of the outer surfaces of the curl guides 21, 22.
   [0104] In each embodiment of FIGS. 5 to 21B, the protrusion 62 is provided on
   the outer surface of the curl guides 21, 22, and can be provided on at least one side
   surface 33 or side surface 34.
   [0105] (17-1)   Also, as shown in an embodiment of FIGS. 22A to 22C, the
 5 protrusion 62 may be mounted at an inner side of the curl guides 21, 22.
   [0106]Herein, the description "mounted at the inner side of the curl guides 21, 22"
   indicates that the protrusion 62 is mounted at a state where the protrusion 62 or at
   least a portion of a part provided integrally with the protrusion 62 is positioned
   inside the curl guides 21, 22.
 0 [0107] In this embodiment, the protrusion 62 has a surface parallel with the right
   and left side surfaces 33, 34 of the curl guides 21, 22.    The protrusion 62 has an
   integrated extension part 91 (refer to FIG. 22B) that is provided at the base end
   side thereof and can be inserted and arranged in the curl guides 21, 22.          The
   extension part 91 has a length that substantially reaches the binding machine main
25 body 5.    Also, the protrusion 62 is coupled to the mounting part 72 via a coupling
   part 92.   The mounting part 72 has a surface positioned outside the side surface
   34 of the curl guides 21, 22 and parallel with the side surface 34.     The mounting
   part 72 can be detachably fixed to the side surface 34 from an outside by using the
   dedicated fixing tool 67.       In the meantime,    the mounting part 72 may be
30 configured to have a size and a shape becoming the protection part 71 configured
   to protect the side surface 34 of the curl guides 21, 22.
   [0108] In the above descriptions, the protrusion 62 (and the protection part 71) is
                                              22

   mounted to the upper curl guide 21.       However, as shown in an embodiment of
   FIG. 23, the protrusion 62 (and the protection part 71) having a similar function
   may be mounted to the lower curl guide 22.       In this case, an angle, a length and
   the like of the guide part 64 may be optimized so that it can be easily used in
 5 conformity to the lower curl guide 22.
   [0109] Also, in the drawings, the reference numerals are omitted for convenience
   sake, and each embodiment may have the configurations shown in the other
   embodiments, as required.
   [0110] (18) The auxiliary member 61 for binding machine may be mounted to the
 o curl guides 21, 22 configured to guide the wire 9 in the loop shape around the
   binding target 6 or to the binding machine main body 5 configured to support the
   curl guides 21, 22.   The auxiliary member 61 for binding machine has the tapered
   protrusion 62 that is positioned at the tip end-side of the curl guides 21, 22 when
   the auxiliary member is mounted to the curl guides 21, 22 or the binding machine
 5 main body 5.     The auxiliary member 61 for binding machine may be configured
   to be detachably mounted to the curl guides 21, 22 or the binding machine main
   body 5.
   [0111] (19) The protrusion 62 may have the guide part 64 at the outer periphery
   side, which is arranged substantially perpendicularly to the extension line 25a of
 0 the shaft 25 of the twisting part 24 configured to bind the binding target 6 by
   twisting the wire 9 guided in the loop shape around the binding target 6.
   [0112] <Operations>
           In the below, the operations of the embodiments are described.
   [0113] In the binding machine 1, at a state where the reel 11 is set to the mounting
25 part 12 and a power supply is ON, the binding target 6 such as reinforcing bars is
   inserted between the pair of upper and lower curl guides 21, 22 from the opening
   23, and the trigger switch 8 is pulled, so that the binding target 6 is bound by the
   wire 9.
   [0114] At this time, the pair of feeding rollers 17 of the feeding part 15 is first
30 rotated, so that the wire 9 wound on the reel 11 is pulled out from the reel 11 and
   is sent into the upper curl guide 21 via the guide member 41.      Then, in the upper
   curl guide 21, the wire 9 sent from the guide member 41 is curled by the curl plate
                                              23

   43 and is delivered toward the lower curl guide 22.        The lower curl guide 22
   receives the wire 9 from the upper curl guide 21 and circulates the wire around the
   binding target 6.    Thereby, the wire 9 is curled by the pair of upper and lower
   curl guides 21, 22, the wire 9 is guided in the loop shape around the binding target
 5 6, and the wire 9 is circulated one or more times around the binding target 6.
   When the wire 9 formed in the loop shape is sent by a predetermined amount, it is
   cut at the cutting part 42.   Further, the wire 9 is twisted by the twisting part 24
   with being wound around the binding target 6, so that a diameter of the loop is
   reduced.    By the above processes, the binding target 6 is bound.
 0 [0115] When binding the binding target 6 arranged to be in contact with the
   surface (the contact surface 63) such as a floor, a wall or the like by using the
   binding machine 1, it is necessary to lift the binding target 6 with a hand opposite
   to a hand carrying the binding machine 1 or to forcibly scoop up the binding target
   6 with the exposed curl guides 21, 22 of the binding machine 1, which increases
 5 the operation burden.
   [0116] <Effects>
           According to the embodiments, following effects can be accomplished by
   the above configurations.
   [0117] (Effect 1)
 0         As shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, the curl guides 21, 22 have the protrusion 62
   having a tapered shape (for example, a claw shape) at the tip end-side.     Thereby,
   when the binding machine 1 is moved as it scrapes the contact surface 63 with the
   protrusion 62, it is possible or easy to directly scoop up the binding target 6 in
   contact with the contact surface 63 by the binding machine            1 (having the
25 protrusion 62).   Therefore, when binding the binding target 6 in contact with the
   contact surface 63, it is not necessary to lift the binding target 6 with a hand
   opposite to a hand holding the binding machine 1 or to forcibly scoop up the
   binding target 6 by the exposed curl guides 21, 22 (of the binding machine 1
   without the protrusion 62), so that it is possible to easily perform the binding
30 operation with one hand.      As a result, it is possible to reduce the operation
   burden and to shorten the operation time.
   [0118] At this time, since the guide part 64 is provided at the outer periphery-side
                                              24

   of the protrusion 62, when the binding machine 1 is moved in one extension
   direction of the guide part 64 along the contact surface 63 while keeping the
   contact state of the guide part 64 with the contact surface 63, it is possible to
   stably move the binding machine 1 and to keep the protrusion 62 at the most
 5 favorable state where it is possible to scoop up the binding target 6.     Therefore, it
   is possible to easily and securely scoop up the binding target 6.
   [0119] (Effect 2)
           The guide part 64 is arranged substantially perpendicularly to the extension
   line 25a of the shaft 25 of the twisting part 24 of the binding machine 1.     Thereby,
 o when the guide part 64 is contacted to the contact surface 63, since the binding
   machine main body 5 is substantially perpendicular to the contact surface 63, it is
   possible to smoothly scoop up the binding target 6 on the ground without turning
   over the wrist and to perform the operation with a posture at which the load is
   least applied to the wrist carrying the binding machine 1.     Also, the guide part 64
 5 becomes a length to exactly contact the contact surface 63, so that it can optimally
   stabilize the linear movement of the binding machine 1.       Therefore, it is possible
   to configure the favorable guide part (i.e., the guide part capable of effortlessly
   and securely scooping up the binding target 6) simply by moving the protrusion 62
   along the contact surface 63.
 0 [0120] In contrast, for example, in case that a linear part similar to the linear
   guide part 64a of FIG. 24A or 25A is provided at an angle (for example, an angel
   sufficiently greater or smaller than 900) different from the above, when it is
   intended to bring the linear part into linear contact with the contact surface 63, the
   binding machine main body 5 is largely inclined relative to the contact surface 63,
25 so that the wrist is unnaturally bent.   Thereby, the linear part cannot be used or is
   difficult to be used as the guide part configured to move with being in contact with
   the contact surface 63.     In addition, it is not possible to skillfully scoop up the
   binding target 6 simply by linearly moving the protrusion 62 along the contact
   surface 63.
30 [0121] For this reason, for example, it is necessary to jointly use the complex
   movement of linearly moving the binding machine 1 so as to insert the tapered
   protrusion 62 between the contact surface 63 and the binding target 6 and then
                                               25

   scooping up the binding target 6 by using a lever principle.
   [0122] However,       when   the   guide part   64   is   arranged   to  be  substantially
   perpendicular to the shaft 25 of the twisting part 24 of the binding machine 1, like
   the above embodiment, it is possible to simply scoop up the binding target 6 just
 5 by linearly moving the binding machine 1 along the guide part 64 and it is not
   necessary to perform the movement using the lever principle.            Therefore, during
   the operation, it is possible to reduce the fatigue and the burden on the wrist and
   the like, so that it is possible to reduce the wrist pain.
   [0123] Also, for example, since it is not necessary to lift the binding target 6 in
 o contact with the contact surface 63 with the hand (opposite to the hand carrying
   the binding machine 1) or to forcibly scoop up the binding target 6 by bringing the
   exposed curl guides 21, 22 (of the binding machine 1 without the protrusion 62)
   into direct contact with the contact surface 63, so that it is possible to prevent
   problems that a fingertip or a glove is damaged or the curl guides 21, 22 are worn,
 5 deformed or distorted.       As a result, it is possible to prevent a problem that a
   malfunction such as a curl defect of the wire 9 and a jamming of the wire 9 due to
   the damage of the curl guides 21, 22 is likely to occur, and to reduce the number
   of replacement times of the curl guides 21, 22.
   [0124] In the meantime, the situation where the binding target 6 in contact with
 0 the contact surface 63 is to be bound actually occurs at a construction site of floor
   heating, for example.      Even in this case, since it is possible to stably bind a mesh
   bar (the binding target 6) and a pipe for heating on the contact surface 63 such as a
   concrete floor, it is possible to securely speed up the operation.            The contact
   surface 63 is not limited to the horizontal surface such as a floor, and may be a
25 vertical surface such as a wall and the other surfaces, for example.
   [0125] (Effect 3)
            As shown in FIG. 11, the protrusion 62 may be detachably mounted to the
   curl guides 21, 22 or the binding machine 1.            Thereby, for example, when the
   protrusion 62 is used to scoop up the binding target 6 and is thus damaged, it is
30 possible to simply replace the protrusion 62.      At this time, since it is sufficient to
   replace only the protrusion 62, it is possible to restore the function of the
   protrusion    62 easily    and inexpensively.      Also,    since  the protrusion   62   is
                                                26

   detachably mounted, it is possible to dividedly use the binding machine 1 for a
   case where the protrusion 62 is required and for a case where the protrusion 62 is
   not required, so that it is possible to widen the uses of the binding machine 1.
   Furthermore, the detachable protrusion 62 can be mounted to the existing binding
 5 machine 1 so as to add the scoop-up function.
   [0126] In contrast, for example, when the protrusion 62 provided as a separate
   member is fixed to the curl guides 21, 22, the binding machine 1 or the like so as
   not to be detachable, the binding machine 1 becomes a dedicated device for scoop
   up, so that it cannot be used by a normal using method.
 0 [0127] (Effect 4)
            The guide part 64 may be configured as a planar surface.       For example,
   when the guide part 64 is configured as the linear guide part 64a having a linear
   portion as shown in FIG. 24A, it is possible to most smoothly guide the guide part
   along the contact surface 63.
 5 [0128] (Effect 5)
            The guide part 64 may be configured as a planar surface having a convex
   portion or a concave portion.     For example, when the guide part 64 is configured
   as the concavo-convex guide part 64b having a concavo-convex portion as shown
   in FIG. 24B or a two-point-like guide part 64c having two-point projections as
 0 shown in FIG. 24C, as compared to the linear guide part 64a shown in FIG. 24A, it
   is possible to reduce a contact area with the contact surface 63, thereby reducing
   the frictional resistance.
   [0129] (Effect 6)
            The guide part 64 may be configured as a curved surface approximate to a
25 planar surface.    For example, when the guide part 64 is configured as a gently
   curved guide part 64d, which has a large radius of curvature and is similar to the
   linear guide part 64a shown in FIG. 24A, it is possible to smoothly guide the guide
   part along the contact surface 63, in the substantially similar manner to the planar
   surface configuration.
30 [0130] (Effect 7)
            The inclined guide part 65 is provided at the inner periphery-side of the
   protrusion 62, so that it is possible to smoothly guide the binding target 6 from the
                                              27

   tip end-side toward the base end-side via the inclined guide part 65.
   [0131] (Effect 7-1)
           The guide part 65 has the boundary part 65p at the position beyond the
   extension line 25a of the shaft 25 of the twisting part 24, and the boundary part
 5 65p guides the binding target 6 from the outside toward the inside of the locus 3 1
   of the wire 5, so that it is possible to widely secure the range in which it is
   possible to keep the binding target 6 inside the guide part 65.          Therefore, it is
   possible to improve the stability when scooping up the binding target 6.           Also,
   since the scooped-up position of the binding target 6 is close to the shaft 25 of the
 o twisting part 24, it is also possible to improve the stability of the binding.
   [0132] The part located closer to the tip end-side of the guide part 65 than the
   boundary part 65p is the part 65a positioned outside the locus 31 of the wire 5, and
   the part located closer to the base end-side of the guide part 65 than the boundary
   part 65p is the part 65b positioned inside the locus 31 of the wire 5, so that it is
 5 possible to securely and smoothly guide the binding target 6 to the inner side of
   the guide part 65 from the part 65a positioned outside the locus 31 of the wire 5
   toward the part 65b positioned inside the locus 31 of the wire 5.
   [0133] Thereby,    for example,      the substantially    entire  region of the inner
   periphery-side of the protrusion 62 is positioned outside the locus 31 of the wire 9
 0 formed in the loop shape.      As a result, it is possible to prevent a problem that the
   wire 9 is contacted to the binding target 6 entering the inside of the locus 31 from
   the outside thereof and the curl defect is thus caused when the wire is shifted from
   the protrusion 62 to the curl guides 21, 22, like a case where the inner periphery
   side of the protrusion 62 does not have a function as the guide part 65.
25 [0134] (Effect 8)
           As shown in the embodiments of FIGS. 12A to 15B, the protrusion 62 may
   be mounted to be displaceable relative to the curl guides 21, 22.          Thereby, it is
   possible to change the shape of the binding machine 1 or to adjust the function of
   the protrusion 62 by using the displacement of the protrusion 62, without
30 mounting and demounting the protrusion 62.           For example, when the protrusion
   62 is required or is not required, it is possible to dividedly use the binding
   machine 1 for an aspect where there is the protrusion 62 and for an aspect where
                                                28

   there is no protrusion 62, so that it is possible to widen the uses of the binding
   machine 1.
   [0135] (Effect 8-1)
           As shown in the embodiment of FIGS. 14A and 14B (or FIGS. 15A and
 5 15B), the protrusion 62 may be displaced by the rotation relative to the curl guides
   21, 22.    When the protrusion 62 is displaced by the rotation, it is possible to
   further increase an amount of the displacement of the protrusion 62 and to
   conceive a method of displacing the protrusion 62.
   [0136] (Effect 8-2)
 0         The protrusion 62 may be displaced by the sliding relative to the curl
   guides 21, 22.    When the protrusion 62 is displaced by the sliding, the protrusion
   62 is displaced with keeping the substantially constant posture, for example, so
   that the protrusion 62 can be displaced to refrain from interfering.
   [0137] (Effect 8-3)
 5         As shown in the embodiment of FIGS. 13A and 13B (or FIGS. 15A and
   15B), the size of the opening 23 between the tip end portions of the curl guides 21,
   22 (or the opening 23a between the tip end portion of the protrusion 62 and the tip
   end portions of the curl guides 21, 22) may be changed by the displacement of the
   protrusion 62.    Thereby, it is possible to optimally adjust the size of the opening
 0 23 (opening 23a) in correspondence to the diameter of the binding target 6.
   [0138] (Effect 9)
           As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 11, at least a part of the outer
   surfaces of the curl guides 21, 22 may be covered from the outside by the
   protection part 71 provided to continue to the protrusion 62.          Thereby, it is
25 possible to prevent the damage of the curl guides 21, 22 and to prolong the
   lifetime of the curl guides 21, 22.         Therefore, it is possible to reduce the
   necessity of replacing the curl guides 21, 22.
   [0139] (Effect 9-1)
           The protection part 71 may have the protection surface 73 configured to
30 protect at least one of the surfaces (the outer periphery-side surface 32 and both
   the side surfaces 33, 34) configuring the curl guides 21, 22.          Thereby, it is
   possible to efficiently protect at least one of the surfaces configuring the curl
                                               29

   guides 21, 22 by the protection surface 73.
   [0140] (Effect 10)
           As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 16, the protection part 71 may have
   the outer periphery protection surface 73a configured to cover the outer periphery
 5 side surface 32 of the outer surfaces of the curl guides 21, 22.         Thereby, it is
   possible to efficiently protect the outer periphery-side surface 32 of the curl
   guides 21, 22, which is most important to form the wire 9 in the loop shape, by the
   outer periphery protection surface 73a.    Also, the outer periphery-side surface 32
   of the curl guides 21, 22 is located at the center in the width direction 4 and both
 0 sides thereof are reinforced by the pair of right and left side surfaces 33, 34, so
   that the sufficient strength is secured.   Therefore, even when the protection part
   71 having the outer periphery protection surface 73a is mounted to the curl guides
   21, 22, it is possible to keep the state where the curl guides 21, 22 are difficult to
   be deformed or damaged, so that it is possible to stably mount the protrusion 62
 5 and the protection part 71 to the curl guides 21, 22.
   [0141] In contrast, for example, when the protrusion 62 is fixed to only one side
   surface 33, 34 of the curl guides 21, 22 from the outside by welding or the like,
   one side surface 33, 34 of the curl guides 21, 22 may be distorted due to the
   welding heat and the strengths of the right and left side surfaces 33, 34 of the curl
 o guides 21, 22 are unbalanced.     As a result, the curl guides 21, 22 are likely to be
   deformed or damaged due to the protrusion 62.
   [0142] (Effect 11)
           As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 17, the protection surface 73 may
   have the L-shaped section part having the outer periphery protection surface 73a
25 and the side surface protection surface 73b configured to cover at least one of the
   side surfaces 33, 34 of the outer surfaces of the curl guides 21, 22.     Thereby, it is
   possible to efficiently protect the outer periphery-side surface 32 and one of the
   side surfaces 33, 34 of the curl guides 21, 22 by the L-shaped protection surface
   73.   Also, the protection part 71 is formed to have the L-shaped section having
30 the outer periphery protection surface 73a and one side surface protection surface
   73b, so that it is possible to keep the state where the curl guides 21, 22 are
   difficult to be deformed or damaged.     Therefore, it is possible to stably mount the
                                              30

   protrusion 62 and the protection part 71 to the curl guides 21, 22.
   [0143] (Effect 12)
           As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 11, the protection part 71 may have
   the C-shaped or U-shaped section part having the outer periphery protection
 5 surface 73a and the pair of side surface protection surfaces 73b, 73b.        Thereby,
   the protection part 71 has the sectional shape, which is substantially the same as
   (substantially similar to) the tip end portions of the curl guides 21, 22, so that it is
   possible to protect the entire tip end portions of the curl guides 21, 22 more
   widely and more efficiently.      Therefore, it is possible to increase the durability
 0 and wear resistance of the entire curl guides 21, 22, thereby efficiently preventing
   the damage and deformation of the curl guides 21, 22.        Also, the protection part
   71 is configured to have the C-shaped or U-shaped section having the outer
   periphery protection surface 73a and the pair of side surface protection surfaces
   73b, 73b, so that it is possible to keep the state where the curl guides 21, 22 are
 5 more difficult to be deformed or damaged.          Therefore, it is possible to more
   stably mount the protrusion 62 and the protection part 71 to the curl guides 21, 22.
   [0144] (Effect 13)
           As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 16 or FIGS. 18A and 18B, the
   protrusion 62 may have the outer periphery constituting surface 62a configuring
 0 the outer periphery-side surface, and the outer periphery constituting surface 62a
   may have the width-narrowed part 75 of which the width gradually decreases
   toward the tip end-side.    Thereby, since the width-narrowed part 75 indicates the
   position through which the wire 9 is to pass, it is possible to easily check the
   position through which the wire 9 is to pass, and to improve the operability.
25 [0145] Also, the width-narrowed part 75 is provided at the tip end portion of the
   outer periphery-side of the protrusion 62, so that it is possible to make it difficult
   for the protrusion 62 to interfere with the binding target 6 at a part at which the
   binding targets 6 intersect with each other, and to bring the tip end portion of the
   protrusion 62 close to the part at which the binding targets 6 intersect with each
30 other.   Therefore, it is possible to correctly bind the binding targets at a position
   closer to the intersection part.
   [0146] (Effect 14)
                                               31

           The protrusion 62 may have the pair of side constituting surfaces 62b, 62b
   configuring the side surfaces, and the width-narrowed part 75 may have a shape
   tapered toward one side constituting surface 62b.
   [0147] (Effect 15)
 5         The protrusion 62 may have the side constituting surfaces            62b, 62b
   configuring the side surfaces, and the side constituting surfaces 62b, 62b may have
   a shape tapered toward the tip end-side.
   [0148] (Effect 16)
           As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 19, the protrusion 62 may have the
 0 mark 81 on the outer periphery-side or inner periphery-side surface.          Thereby,
   when the protrusion 62 is provided, it is possible to easily check the position
   through which the wire 9 is to pass, and to improve the operability.
   [0149] (Effect 16-1)
           The mark 81 may be configured by the projection portion 81a or the
 5 concave portion 81b.      Thereby, the mark 81 can be configured so that it can be
   easily made and easily distinguished from the outside.
   [0150] (Effect 16-2)
           The mark 81 may be provided at the outer periphery-side or the inner
   periphery-side of the protrusion 62.      Thereby, it is possible to provide the mark
 0 81 at a position at which it is most noticeable during the operation.
   [0151] (Effect 16-3)
           As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 11 or FIG. 20, the protrusion 62 may
   be mounted and fixed to the mounting member 85 that is provided at the position
   deviating from the locus 31 along which the wire 9 in the curl guides 21, 22 is to
25 be guided in the loop shape.        Thereby, it is possible to provide the mounting
   member 85 within the curl guides 21, 22 without interfering with the loop-shaped
   locus 31 of the wire 9.    Also, it is possible to secure the mounting strength of the
   curl guides 21, 22 to the protrusion 62 by the mounting member 85.
   [0152] (Effect 16-4)
30         As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 11, the protrusion 62 may be directly
   mounted to the curl guides 21, 22.      Thereby, it is possible to make the protrusion
   62 small.    At least the part of the curl guides 21, 22 to which the protrusion 62 is
                                               32

   mounted may be configured to be replaceable.           Alternatively, the protrusion 62
   may be mounted to the replaceable part of the curl guides 21, 22.         Thereby, it is
   possible to replace (at least a part of) the curl guides 21, 22 and the protection part
   71 at one time and at relatively low cost.
 5 [0153] (Effect 16-5)
           As shown in the embodiment of FIGS. 21A and 21B, the protrusion 62 may
   be configured to extend from the binding machine main body 5.             Thereby, it is
   possible to securely mount the protrusion 62 by using the binding machine main
   body 5, and to cover and protect the substantially entire curl guides 21, 22 by the
 0 protection part 71.
   [0154] (Effect 17)
           As shown in each embodiment of FIGS. 5 to 21B, the protrusion 62 may be
   mounted to at least one side surface of the outer surfaces of the curl guides 21, 22.
   Thereby, it is possible to simply mount the protrusion 62 from the outside of the
 5 curl guides 21, 22, and to efficiently protect the outer side of the curl guides 21,
   22.   Also, it is possible to more simply mount and demount the protection part 71.
   [0155] (Effect 17-1)
           As shown in the embodiment of FIGS. 22A to 22C, the protrusion 62 may
   be mounted inside the curl guides 21, 22.         Thereby, it is possible to make the
 o protection part 71 small.    Also, it is possible to provide the protrusion 62 without
   increasing an outer shape of the curl guides 21, 22.      Furthermore, it is possible to
   mount the protrusion 62 by using a component and the like provided inside the
   curl guides 21, 22.

25 may be provided with a configuration (for example, a detachable structure, a
   displaceable structure, the protection part 71, the mark 81 and the like) similar to
   the protrusion 62 mounted outside the curl guides 21, 22.
   [0157] (Effect 18)
           According    to the auxiliary member        61  for binding machine      of the
