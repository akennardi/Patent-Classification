   Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
10 having a game controller arranged to implement a game
   wherein the same plurality of combinations of symbol
   positions are evaluated irrespective of the bet placed by
   the player. As a result, in embodiments where the game
   involves win lines, the same number of win lines is always
15 evaluated irrespective of the bet.
   General construction of gaming system
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
20 a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
25 wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
30 wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
35 operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
                                            10084553_1 (GHMatters) P77223.AU.4 16/03/18

   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.   For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
 5 and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.     For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
10 and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system comprises
   several core components. At the broadest level, the core
15 components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
20 instructions and play the game.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
25 and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 that enables a player to input game play
   instructions  (e.g. to place bets), and one or more
   speakers 58.
30 The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play instructions are stored
35 as program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
                                             10084553_1 (GHMatters) P77223.AU.4 16/03/18

                               - 8
   accordance with game play rules and may include:              a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.

   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
10 by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
15 chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.    Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   A player marketing module  (not shown) having a
   reading device may also be provided for the purpose of
20 reading a player tracking device, for example as part of a
   loyalty program.   The player tracking device may be in the
   form of a card, flash drive or any other portable storage
   medium capable of being read by the reading device.
25 A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.         Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
30 beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
35 device.   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
                                              10084553_1 (GHMatters) P77223.AU.4 16/03/18

                               - 9
   electromechanical device.   The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
   type.

   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
10 The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102.   Instructions and data to control
   operation of the processor 102 are stored in a memory 103,
   which is in data communication with the processor 102.
   Typically, the gaming machine 100 will include both
15 volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
   type of memory, with such memories being collectively
   represented by the memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
20 including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.  The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
25 own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.          Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
30 random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 comprise one or more displays 106, a touch
35 screen and/or buttons 107, a card and/or ticket reader
   108, a printer 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input
   mechanism 110 and a coin output mechanism 111.           Additional
                                             10084553_1 (GHMatters) P77223.AU.4 16/03/18

                              - 10
   hardware may be included as part of the gaming machine
   100, or hardware may be omitted as required for the
   specific implementation.
 5 In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a central controller, server or database and receive
10 data or commands from the central controller, server or
   database.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
15 103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.              The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.              The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
20 103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
25 It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
30 Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
35 network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
                                            10084553_1 (GHMatters) P77223.AU.4 16/03/18

                              - 11
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
 5
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
10 associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
15 part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
20 management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
25 accounting functions for the Jackpot game.      A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
30 machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.  With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
35 return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
                                            10084553_1 (GHMatters) P77223.AU.4 16/03/18

                              - 12
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
 5 administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
10 network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
15 for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
20 plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
25 could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.

   Further detail of gaming system
   Referring to Figure 6, the player operates game play
   mechanism 56 to input an initiate play instruction
35 selected from one of a plurality of available initiate
   play instructions.  As described above, the game play
   mechanism can be in the form of a touch screen and/or
                                             10084553_1 (GHMatters) P77223.AU.4 16/03/18

                              - 13
   buttons. In the embodiment, irrespective of the initiate
   play instruction that is entered the outcome evaluator 623
   evaluates the same plurality of combinations of display
   positions in accordance with at least one game rule 642.
 5
   In one embodiment, the outcome evaluator 623 will evaluate
   a plurality of win lines specified by game rule data 641.
   Figure 8 shows an example of a game play mechanism 56 for
   such an embodiment. In this example, there are 25 win
10 lines evaluated. A player can choose between four
   different initiate play instructions by pressing (or
   touching in a touch screen embodiment) one of buttons
   561,562,563,564. Button 561 corresponds to a bet of 25
   credits, button 562 corresponds to a bet of 50 credits and
15 button 563 corresponds to a bet of 250 credits. "Play
   Again" button 564 may be employed to initiate play using
   the previously placed bet again.
   The outcome generator 622 operates in response to the
20 player's operation of game play mechanism 56 to generate a
   game outcome which will then be evaluated by outcome
   evaluator 623. The outcome generator forms the game
   outcome by employing random number generator 621 to
   randomly select symbols from a set of symbols specified by
25 symbol data 641. The selected symbols are advised to the
   display controller 625 which causes them to be displayed
   on display 54 at a set of display positions. Outcome
   generator 622 selects symbols for display from a plurality
   of symbol sets corresponding to respective ones of a
30 plurality of spinning reels. Thus, the symbol sets 641
   specify a sequence of symbols for each reel such that the
   outcome generator 622 can, in one example, select symbols
   for display by selecting a stopping position in the
   sequence. One example, three symbols of each of five reels
35 may be displayed such that symbols are displayed at
   fifteen display positions on display 54. To obtain a
   desired return to player, a probability table having
                                            10084553_1 (GHMatters) P77223.AU.4 16/03/18

                               - 14
   weighted outcomes is typically employed when selecting the
   symbols.
   Outcome evaluator 623 evaluates each of the plurality of
 5 win lines to determine which, if any, of the win lines
   corresponds to a winning combination specified in the
   prize data 642A based on game rules. For example, the game
   rules may specify that all combinations are evaluated left
   to right or can be evaluated right to left or both.
10 Depending on the specific rules of the game implemented by
   the embodiment, the outcome evaluator may evaluate the win
   lines to determine whether they provide a trigger for a
   feature  (or secondary) game.
15 The outcome evaluator 623 may also make additional
   evaluations known in the art, for example "scatters" where
   a player is awarded a prize or a feature game for a
   designated number of symbols, irrespective of whether they
   are on a win line. By way of example, the feature game may
20 be a series of free games, in which case outcome evaluator
   623 triggers outcome generator 622 to carry out a series
   of free games and outcome evaluator 623 evaluates each of
   these games to determine any awards to be made. Prize
   awarder 624 determines the quantum of the award to be made
25 from the initiate play instruction (e.g. based on the size
   of the bet) and the prizes are accumulated to a win meter
   stored as meter data 643. Once all outcomes have been
   generated and a further game play instruction is required
   before any further play can occur, credits are transferred
30 to a credit meter in meter data 643. In embodiments, where
   a gamble feature is offered it may be possible, for
   example to seek to double the accumulated win at the risk
   of losing it. In such embodiments, it may be necessary for
   a player to operate the game play mechanism 56 to indicate
35 they want to take an accumulated win or to initiate                a
   further play of the game before credits are transferred
   from the win meter to the credit meter.

   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that win lines
   are formed by a combination of displayed symbol positions,
   one from each reel, the symbol positions being located
 5 relative to one another such that they form a line.
   Examples of win lines are given in Australian patent
   684195 owned by Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty.
   Ltd.
10 Figure 6 shows an operator interface 66 which is deployed
   in some embodiments to enable the operator of the venue at
   which the game can be played to configure the number of
   lines which constitute the plurality of win lines. In this
   example, the operator can select between 4 options,
15 661,662,663,664 corresponding to different numbers of a
   plurality of win lines offerable under the game rules 642.
   For example, 6, 9, 15 or a maximum of 25 lines.             In such
   embodiments, the game rules 641 may default to the maximum
   number of lines offerable under the game rules. In such
20 embodiments, it may be desirable for the game play
   mechanism to be provided by touch screen buttons to make
   it easy to change the text displayed to each player on the
   buttons.
25 In the above description it will be appreciated that the
   various of the above functional modules are implemented by
   processor 62 executing code stored in memory 64. Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that other embodiments
   are possible including dedicated circuits.
30
   Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, the outcome evaluator may evaluate symbol
   combinations in a different way. For example, in the
   manner in which outcomes are evaluated in games marketed
35 under the trade name "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure
   Industries Pty Ltd and described in US 6,093,102. In such
   games symbol combinations are made by forming combinations
                                            10084553_1 (GHMatters) P77223.AU.4 16/03/18

                                 - 16
   from each selected reel by combining it with all the
   selected positions of other reels. In other words, all
   symbol positions of a selected reel can be used to form
   symbol combinations with designated, symbol display
 5 positions of other reels. This means that in embodiments
   where there are three symbols displayed for each reel and
   five reels, there are 243 different symbol combinations
    (35) to be evaluated by the outcome evaluator (also known
   as "ways"  to win).   Thus in  this embodiment,     the game rules
10 641 may specify for example the evaluation of 2,3,4 or 5
   reels irrespective of the game play instruction. This may
   be configurable by the operator in the manner described
   above.
15 The method 700 is summarised in Figure 7 and involves
   receiving 710 an initiate game play instruction,
   generating 720 a game outcome, and evaluating 730 plural
   different combination of symbol positions irrespective of
   the initiate play instruction.

   Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate that the
   method of the embodiment could be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a computer readable medium, such as a
25 disc or a memory    (for example, that could replace part of
   memory 103) or as a data signal     (for example, by
   downloading it from a server which results in the program
   code being transmitted from the server to a gaming machine
   or computer which receives it).
