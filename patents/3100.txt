1.      RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial
No. 61/363,981, filed July 13, 2010 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No.
61/497,897, filed June 16, 2011, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference
herein in their entirety.
2.      FIELD
[0002] Provided herein are methods of producing a population of natural killer cells, e.g.,
natural killer cells derived from placenta, for example, from placental perfusate (e.g., human
placental perfusate) such as placenta-derived intermediate natural killer cells, or other tissues,
for example, umbilical cord blood or peripheral blood. Also provided herein are expanded
natural killer cell populations produced by the methods presented herein. Further provided
herein are methods of using the placental perfusate, and the natural killer cells therefrom, to
suppress the proliferation of tumor cells. In certain embodiments, the natural killer cells are
used in combination with, or treated with, one or more immunomodulatory compounds, e.g.,
immunomodulatory compounds referred to as IMiDsTM.
3.      BACKGROUND
[0003] Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that constitute a major component
of the innate immune system. NK cells do not express T-cell antigen receptors (TCR), CD3 or
surface immunoglobulins (Ig) B cell receptor. NK cells generally express the surface markers
CD16 (FcyRIII) and CD56 in humans, but a subclass of human NK cells is CD16-. NK cells
are cytotoxic; small granules in their cytoplasm contain special proteins such as perforin and
proteases known as granzymes. Upon release in close proximity to a cell targeted for killing,
perforin forms pores in the cell membrane of the target cell through which the granzymes and
associated molecules can enter, inducing apoptosis. One granzyme, granzyme B (also known
as granzyme 2 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated serine esterase 1), is a serine protease
crucial for rapid induction of target cell apoptosis in the cell-mediated immune response.
[0004] NK cells are activated in response to interferons or macrophage-derived cytokines.
Activated NK cells are referred to as lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells.           NK cells
                                                  1

    WO 2012/009422                                                         PCT/US2011/043831
possess two types of surface receptors, labeled "activating receptors" and "inhibitory
receptors," that control the cells' cytotoxic activity.
[0005] Among other activities, NK cells play a role in the host rejection of tumors. Because
cancer cells have reduced or no class I MHC expression, they can become targets of NK cells.
Accumulating clinical data suggest that haploidentical transplantation of human NK cells
isolated from peripheral blood monomuclear cells (PBMC) or bone marrow mediate potent
anti-leukemia effects without incurring detectable graft versus host disease (GVHD). See
Ruggeri et al., Science 295:2097-2100 (2002)). Natural killer cells can become activated by
cells lacking, or displaying reduced levels of, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
proteins. Additionally, the activating receptors expressed on NK cells are known to mediate
detection of "stressed" or transformed cells with express ligands to activating receptors and
therefore trigger the NK cell activation. For instance, NCR1 (NKp46) binds viral
hemagglutinins. NKG2D ligands include CMV UL16-binding protein 1 (ULB 1), ULB2,
ULB3 and MHC-class-I-polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) and MICB proteins. NK
protein 2B4 binds CD48, and DNAM-1 binds Poliovirus receptor (PVR) and Nectin-2, both
are consistently detected in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). See Penda et al., Blood 105:
2066-2073 (2004). Moreover, lysis of AML has been described to be mainly natural
cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) dependent. See Fauriat et al., Blood 109: 323-330 (2007).
Activated and expanded NK cells and LAK cells from peripheral blood have been used in
both ex vivo therapy and in vivo treatment of patients having advanced cancer, with some
success against bone marrow related diseases, such as leukemia; breast cancer; and certain
types of lymphoma. LAK cell treatment requires that the patient first receive IL-2, followed
by leukopheresis and then an ex vivo incubation and culture of the harvested autologous
blood cells in the presence of IL-2 for a few days. The LAK cells must be reinfused along
with relatively high doses of IL-2 to complete the therapy. This purging treatment is
expensive and can cause serious side effects. These include fluid retention, pulmonary
edema, drop in blood pressure, and high fever.
[0006] In spite of the advantageous properties of NK cells in killing tumor cells and virus
infected cells, they remain difficult to work with and to apply in immunotherapy, primarily
due to the difficulty in maintaining their tumor-targeting and tumoricidal capabilities during
culture and expansion. Thus, there is a need in the art to develop an efficient method to
produce and expand natural killer cells that retain tumoricidal functions.

6.       DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0061] Provided herein is a novel method of producing and expanding NK cells from
hematopoietic cells, e.g., hematopoietic stem cells or progenitor cells. The hematopoietic
cells used to produce the NK cells may be isolated from any source, for example, without
limitation, placenta, umbilical cord blood, placental blood, peripheral blood, spleen or liver.
In certain embodiment, the NK cells are produced from expanded hematopoietic cells, e.g.,
hematopoietic stem cells and/or hematopoietic progenitor cells. In one embodiment,
hematopoietic cells are collected from a source of such cells, e.g., placental perfusate,
umbilical cord blood, placental blood, peripheral blood, spleen, liver and/or bone marrow. In
a specific embodiment, the hematopoietic cells are expanded and differentiated, continuously,
in a first medium without the use of feeder cells. The cells are then cultured in a second
medium in the presence of feeder cells. Such isolation, expansion and differentiation can be
performed in a central facility, which provides expanded hematopoietic cells for shipment to
decentralized expansion and differentiation at points of use, e.g., hospital, military base,
military front line, or the like.

hematopoietic stem cells, or the like. Hematopoietic cells can be obtained from tissue
sources such as, e.g., bone marrow, cord blood, placental blood, peripheral blood, liver or the
like, or combinations thereof. Hematopoietic cells can be obtained from placenta. In a
specific embodiment, the hematopoietic cells are obtained from placental perfusate.
Hematopoietic cells from placental perfusate can comprise a mixture of fetal and maternal
hematopoietic cells, e.g., a mixture in which maternal cells comprise greater than 5% of the
total number of hematopoietic cells. Preferably, hematopoietic cells from placental perfusate
comprise at least about 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 99.5% fetal cells.

embodiment, the hematopoietic cells, e.g., hematopoietic stem cells or progenitor cells, from
which the TSNK cells are produced, are combined cells from placental perfusate and cord
blood, e.g., cord blood from the same placenta as the perfusate. In another specific
embodiment, said umbilical cord blood is isolated from a placenta other than the placenta
from which said placental perfusate is obtained. In certain embodiments, the combined cells
can be obtained by pooling or combining the cord blood and placental perfusate. In certain

to 1:3. In another specific embodiment, the cord blood and placental perfusate are combined
at a ratio of 10:1, 5:1, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, 1:5 or 1:10. In a more specific embodiment, the cord
blood and placental perfusate are combined at a ratio of 8.5:1.5 (85%:15%).
[0064] In certain embodiments, the cord blood and placental perfusate are combined at a ratio
of 100:1, 95:5, 90:10, 85:15, 80:20, 75:25, 70:30, 65:35, 60:40, 55:45: 50:50, 45:55, 40:60,

[0065] In another specific embodiment, the hematopoietic cells, e.g., hematopoietic stem
cells or progenitor cells from which said TSNK cells are produced are from both umbilical
cord blood and placental perfusate, but wherein said umbilical cord blood is isolated from a
placenta other than the placenta from which said placental perfusate is obtained.
[0066] In certain embodiments, the hematopoietic cells are CD34 cells. In specific
embodiments, the hematopoietic cells useful in the methods disclosed herein are
CD34VCD38       or CD34vCD38-. In a more specific embodiment, the hematopoietic cells are
CD34CD38-Lin . In another specific embodiment, the hematopoietic cells are one or more
of CD2-, CD3-, CD1 1b-, CD1 1c-, CD14, CD16-, CD19-, CD24-, CD56-, CD66b- and/or
glycophorin A-. In another specific embodiment, the hematopoietic cells are CD2-, CD3-,
CD11b-, CD11c-, CD14-, CD16-, CD19-, CD24-, CD56-, CD66b- and glycophorin A. In
another more specific embodiment, the hematopoietic cells are CD34CD38-CD33-CD1 17-.

hematopoietic cell is Thy-1V. In a specific embodiment, the hematopoietic cell is CD34vThy
1. In another embodiment, the hematopoietic cells are CD133v. In specific embodiments,
the hematopoietic cells are CD34VCD133 or CD133vThy-1v.            In another specific
embodiment, the CD34 hematopoietic cells are CXCR4.            In another specific embodiment,
the CD34 hematopoietic cells are CXCR4-. In another embodiment, the hematopoietic cells
are positive for KDR (vascular growth factor receptor 2). In specific embodiments, the
hematopoietic cells are CD34VKDR, CD133KDR or Thy-1vKDR.                   In certain other
embodiments, the hematopoietic cells are positive for aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH+), e.g.,
the cells are CD34+ALDH+.
[0068] In certain other embodiments, the CD34+ cells are CD45-. In specific embodiments,
the CD34+ cells, e.g., CD34+, CD45- cells express one or more, or all, of the miRNAs hsa
miR-380, hsa-miR-512, hsa-miR-517, hsa-miR-518c, hsa-miR-519b, and/or hsa-miR-520a.

   WO 2012/009422                                                            PCT/US2011/043831
[0070] The hematopoietic cells can also lack certain markers that indicate lineage
commitment, or a lack of developmental naivete. For example, in another embodiment, the
hematopoietic cells are HLA-DR . In specific embodiments, the hematopoietic cells are
CD34vHLA-DR-, CD133vHLA-DR-, Thy-l' HLA-DR- or ALDHVHLA-DR                         In another

markers CD2, CD3, CD11b, CD11c, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD24, CD56, CD66b and
glycophorin A.
[0071] Thus, hematopoietic cells can be selected for use in the methods disclosed herein on
the basis of the presence of markers that indicate an undifferentiated state, or on the basis of
the absence of lineage markers indicating that at least some lineage differentiation has taken
place. Methods of isolating cells, including hematopoietic cells, on the basis of the presence
or absence of specific markers is discussed in detail, e.g., in Section 6.1.2, below.
[0072] Hematopoietic cells used in the methods provided herein can be a substantially
homogeneous population, e.g., a population comprising at least about 95%, at least about
98% or at least about 99% hematopoietic cells from a single tissue source, or a population
comprising hematopoietic cells exhibiting the same hematopoietic cell-associated cellular
markers. For example, in various embodiments, the hematopoietic cells can comprise at least
about 95%, 98% or 99% hematopoietic cells from bone marrow, cord blood, placental blood,
peripheral blood, or placenta, e.g., placenta perfusate.
[0073] Hematopoietic cells used in the methods provided herein can be obtained from a
single individual, e.g., from a single placenta, or from a plurality of individuals, e.g., can be
pooled. Where the hematopoietic cells are obtained from a plurality of individuals and
pooled, the hematopoietic cells may be obtained from the same tissue source. Thus, in
various embodiments, the pooled hematopoietic cells are all from placenta, e.g., placental
perfusate, all from placental blood, all from umbilical cord blood, all from peripheral blood,
and the like.
[0074] Hematopoietic cells used in the methods disclosed herein can, in certain embodiments,
comprise hematopoietic cells from two or more tissue sources. For example, in certain
embodiments, when hematopoietic cells from two or more sources are combined for use in
the methods herein, a plurality of the hematopoietic cells used to produce TSNK cells
comprise hematopoietic cells from placenta, e.g., placenta perfusate. In various embodiments,
the hematopoietic cells used to produce TSNK cells comprise hematopoietic cells from
placenta and from cord blood; from placenta and peripheral blood; from placenta and
placental blood, or placenta and bone marrow. In a preferred embodiment, the hematopoietic

cells comprise hematopoietic cells from placental perfusate in combination with
hematopoietic cells from cord blood, wherein the cord blood and placenta are from the same
individual, i.e., wherein the perfusate and cord blood are matched. In embodiments in which
the hematopoietic cells comprise hematopoietic cells from two tissue sources, the
hematopoietic cells from the sources can be combined in a ratio of, for example, 1:10, 2:9,
3:8, 4:7:, 5:6, 6:5, 7:4, 8:3, 9:2, 1:10, 1:9, 1:8, 1:7, 1:6, 1:5, 1:4, 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1,
6:1, 7:1, 8:1 or 9:1.
                 6.1.1.  Placental Hematopoietic Stem Cells
[0075] In certain embodiments, the hematopoietic cells used in the methods provided herein
are placental hematopoietic cells. As used herein, "placental hematopoietic cells" means
hematopoietic cells obtained from the placenta itself, and not from placental blood or from
umbilical cord blood. In one embodiment, placental hematopoietic cells are CD34v. In a
specific embodiment, the placental hematopoietic cells are predominantly (e.g., at least about
50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 98%) CD34vCD38- cells. In
another specific embodiment, the placental hematopoietic cells are predominantly (e.g., at
least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 98%) CD34CD38
cells. Placental hematopoietic cells can be obtained from a post-partum mammalian (e.g.,
human) placenta by any means known to those of skill in the art, e.g., by perfusion.
[0076] In another embodiment, the placental hematopoietic cell is CD45-. In a specific
embodiment, the hematopoietic cell is CD34vCD45-. In another specific embodiment, the
placental hematopoietic cells are CD34VCD45.
        6.2.     Production of Natural Killer Cells
[0077] Production of NK cells by the present method comprises expanding a population of
hematopoietic cells. During cell expansion, a plurality of hematopoietic cells within the
hematopoietic cell population differentiate into NK cells.
[0078] In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of producing a population of
activated natural killer (NK) cells, comprising: (a) seeding a population of hematopoietic
stem or progenitor cells in a first medium comprising interleukin- 15 (IL-15) and, optionally,
one or more of stem cell factor (SCF) and interleukin-7 (IL-7), wherein said IL-15 and
optional SCF and IL-7 are not comprised within an undefined component of said medium,
such that the population expands, and a plurality of hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells
within said population of hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells differentiate into NK cells

    WO 2012/009422                                                           PCT/US2011/043831
during said expanding; and (b) expanding the cells from step (a) in a second medium
comprising interleukin-2 (IL-2), to produce a population of activated NK cells.
[0079] In another embodiment, NK cells provided herein are produced by a two-step process
of expansion/ differentiation and maturation of NK cells. The fist and second steps comprise
culturing the cells in media with a unique combination of cellular factors. In certain
embodiments, the process involves (a) culturing and expanding a population of hematopoietic
cells in a first medium, wherein a plurality of hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells within
the hematopoietic cell population differentiate into NK cells; and (b) expanding the NK cells
from step (a) in a second medium, wherein the NK cells are further expanded and
differentiated, and wherein the NK cells are maturated (e.g., activated or otherwise
possessing cytotoxic activity). In certain embodiments, the method includes no intermediary
steps between step (a) and (b), no additional culturing steps prior to step (a), and/or no
additional steps (e.g., maturation step) after step (b).
                 6.2.1.  First Culturing Step
[0080] In certain embodiments, the methods provided herein comprises a first step of
culturing and expanding a population of hematopoietic cells in a first medium, wherein a
plurality of hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells within the hematopoietic cell population
differentiate into NK cells.
[0081] Without wishing to be bound by any parameter, mechanism or theory, culture of the
hematopoietic cells as provided herein results in continuous expansion of the hematopoietic
cells and differentiation of NK cells from said cells. In certain embodiments, hematopoietic
cells, e.g., stem cells or progenitor cells, used in the methods provided herein are expanded
and differentiated in the first step using a feeder layer. In other embodiments, hematopoietic
cells, e.g., stem cells or progenitor cells, are expanded and differentiated in the first step
without the use of a feeder layer.
[0082] Feeder cell-independent expansion and differentiation of hematopoietic cells can take
place in any container compatible with cell culture and expansion, e.g., flask, tube, beaker,
dish, multiwell plate, bag or the like. In a specific embodiment, feeder cell-independent
expansion of hematopoietic cells takes place in a bag, e.g., a flexible, gas-permeable
fluorocarbon culture bag (for example, from American Fluoroseal). In a specific embodiment,
the container in which the hematopoietic cells are expanded is suitable for shipping, e.g., to a
site such as a hospital or military zone wherein the expanded NK cells are further expanded
and differentiated.

[0083] In certain embodiments, hematopoietic cells are expanded and differentiated, e.g., in a
continuous fashion, in a first culture medium. In one embodiment, the first culture medium is

or any modified variants or combinations thereof.
[0084] In preferred embodiments, the first culture medium comprises one or more of medium
supplements (e.g., nutrients, cytokines and/or factors). Medium supplements suitable for use
in the methods provided herein include, for example without limitation, serum such as human
serum AB, fetal bovine serum (FBS) or fetal calf serum (FCS), vitamins, bovine serum
albumin (BSA), amino acids (e.g., L-glutamine), fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid, linoleic acid or
palmitic acid), insulin (e.g., recombinant human insulin), transferrin (iron saturated human
transferrin), P-mercaptoethanol, stem cell factor (SCF), Fms-like-tyrosine kinase 3 ligand

thrombopoietin (Tpo), heparin, or O-acetyl-carnitine (also referred to as acetylcamitine, 0
acetyl-L-camitine or OAC). In a specific embodiment, the medium used herein comprises
human serum AB. In another specific embodiment, the medium used herein comprises FBS.
In another specific embodiment, the medium used herein comprises OAC.
[0085] In certain embodiments, the first medium does not comprise one or more of,

[0086] Thus, in one aspect, provided herein is a two-step method of producing NK cells,
wherein said first step comprises expanding and differentiating a population of hematopoietic

[0092] In a specific embodiment, expansion of the hematopoietic cells is performed in
IMDM supplemented with 20% BITS (bovine serum albumin, recombinant human insulin
and transferrin), SCF, Flt-3 ligand, IL-3, and 4-(Amino)-2-(2,6-dioxo(3-piperidyl))
isoindoline-1,3-dione (10 [tM in 0.05% DMSO). In a more specific embodiment, about 5 x
107 hematopoietic cells, e.g., CD34* cells, are expanded in the medium to from about 5 x 1010
cells to about 5 x 101 cells, which are resuspended in 100 mL of IMDM to produce a
population of expanded hematopoietic cells. The population of expanded hematopoietic cells
is preferably cryopreserved to facilitate shipping.

    WO 2012/009422                                                             PCT/US2011/043831
[0093] In various specific embodiments, at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%. 75%, 80%,
85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or 99% of the hematopoietic cells are differentiated to NK cells.
[0094] In certain embodiments, the method of expansion and differentiation of the
hematopoietic cells, as described herein, comprises maintaining the cell population
comprising said hematopoietic cells at between about 2 x 104 and about 2 x 105 cells per
milliliter during expansion and differentiation. In certain other embodiments, the method of
expansion and differentiation of the hematopoietic cells, as described herein, comprises
maintaining the cell population comprising said hematopoietic cells at no more than about 1 x
105 cells per milliliter.
[0095] The time for expansion and differentiation of hematopoietic cells into NK cells can be,
for example, from about 3 days to about 120 days. In one embodiment, the differentiation
time is about 7 days to about 75 days. In another embodiment, the differentiation time is
about 14 days to about 50 days. In a specific embodiment, the differentiation time is about
21 days to about 28 days.
                 6.2.2.   Second Step
[0096] In the method provided herein, the hematopoietic cells, e.g., stem cells or progenitor
cells, and natural killer cells, resulting from the first step, are further expanded and
differentiated in a second step, e.g., without the use of feeder layer or in the presence of
feeder cells. Culture of the cells as provided herein results in continuous expansion,
differentiation as well as maturation of the NK cells from the first step. In the second step,
the NK cells are expanded, differentiated and maturated, in a continuous fashion, in a second
culture medium, e.g., comprising different cytokines and/or bioactive molecules than said
first medium. In certain embodiments, the second culture medium is an animal component
free medium. Exemplary animal component-free cell culture media are described in Section
6.2.1, above.
[0097] Thus, in one aspect, provided herein is a method of producing NK cells, comprising
expanding the NK cells from the first step, described above, in a second medium in the
presence of feeder cells and in contact with interleukin-2 (IL-2). In specific embodiments,
said second medium comprises cell growth medium comprising IL-2, e.g., 10 IU/mL to 1000
IU/mL, and one or more of: human serum (e.g., human serum AB), fetal bovine serum (FBS)
or fetal calf serum (FCS), e.g., 5%-15% FCS v/v; transferrin, e.g., 10 [tg/mL to 50 [tg/niL;
insulin, e.g., 5 [tg/mL to 20 [tg/mL; ethanolamine, e.g., 5 x 10-4 to 5 x 10-5 M; oleic acid, e.g.,
0.1 ptg/nL to 5 [tg/mL; linoleic acid, e.g., 0.1 [tg/mL to 5 [tg/mL; palmitic acid, e.g., 0.05

    WO 2012/009422                                                            PCT/US2011/043831
ptg/mL to 2 [tg/mL; bovine serum albumin (BSA), e.g., 1 [ig/mL to 5 [ig/mL; and/or
phytohemagglutinin, e.g., 0.01 ptg/mL to 1 [tg/mL. In a more specific embodiment, said
second medium comprises cell growth medium comprising FBS or FCS, e.g., 10% FCS v/v,
IL-2, transferrin, insulin, ethanolamine, oleic acid, linoleic acid, palmitic acid, bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and phytohemagglutinin. In a more specific embodiment, said second
medium comprises Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM), 10% FBS or FCS, 400
IU IL-2, 35    g/mL transferrin, 5 ig/mL insulin, 2 x 10-5 M ethanolamine, 1 [ig/mL oleic acid,
1 [tg/mL linoleic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2 ptg/mL palmitic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 2.5 pig/mL
BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1 ptg/mL phytohemagglutinin.
[0098] In certain embodiments, the second medium does not comprise one or more of,
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating
factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), macrophage inflammatory Protein 1 a (MIPla), or
leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF).
[0099] In addition to the method, provided herein are any of the media described above as
compositions.
[00100]          Feeder cells, when used, can be established from various cell types. Examples
of these cell types include, without limitation, fibroblasts, stem cells (e.g., tissue culture
adherent placental stem cells), blood cells (e.g., peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)),
and cancerous cells (e.g., chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells such as K562). In a
specific embodiment, said culturing in said second medium comprises culturing using feeder
cells, e.g., K562 cells and/or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), e.g., at the time
the cells are started in said second medium, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days thereafter. In
certain embodiments, feeder cells are optionally from a different species as the cells they are
supporting. For example, human NK cells can be supported by mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(from primary culture or a telomerized line).
[00101] In certain embodiments, feeder cells are optionally inactivated by irradiation (e.g., y
irradiation) or treatment with an anti-mitotic agent such as mitomycin C, to prevent them
from outgrowing the cells they are supporting, but permit synthesis of important factors that
support the NK cells. For example, cells can be irradiated at a dose to inhibit proliferation
but permit synthesis of important factors that support human embryonic stem (hES) cells
(about 4000 rads gamma irradiation).
[00102] Culture of NK cells for the second step can take place in any container compatible
with cell culture and expansion, e.g., flask, tube, beaker, dish, multiwell plate, bag or the like.
In a specific embodiment, feeder cell-dependent culture of NK cells takes place in a bag, e.g.,

    WO 2012/009422                                                           PCT/US2011/043831
a flexible, gas-permeable fluorocarbon culture bag (for example, from American Fluoroseal).
In a specific embodiment, the container in which the NK cells are cultured is suitable for
shipping, e.g., to a site such as a hospital or military zone wherein the expanded NK cells are
further expanded, differentiated and maturated.
[00103] Differentiation of the cells from step 1 into TSNK cells can be assessed by detecting
NK cell-specific markers, e.g., by flow cytometry. NK cell-specific markers include, but are
not limited to, CD56, CD94, CD 117 and NKp46. Differentiation can also be assessed by the
morphological characteristics of NK cells, e.g., large size, high protein synthesis activity in
the abundant endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and/or preformed granules.
[00104] The time for expansion and differentiation of cells from step 1 into TSNK cells can
be, for example, from about 3 days to about 120 days. In one embodiment, the
differentiation time is about 7 days to about 75 days. In another embodiment, the
differentiation time is about 14 days to about 50 days. In a specific embodiment, the
differentiation time is about 10 days to about 21 days.
[00105] Differentiation of hematopoietic cells into NK cells can be assessed by detecting
markers, e.g., CD56, CD94, CD1 17, NKG2D, DNAM-1 and NKp46, by, for example, flow
cytometry. Differentiation can also be assessed by the morphological characteristics of NK
cells, e.g., large size, high protein synthesis activity in the abundant endoplasmic reticulum
(ER), and/or preformed granules. Maturation of NK cells (e.g., TSNK cells) can be assessed
by detecting one or more functionally relevant makers, for example, CD94, CD 161, NKp44,
DNAM-1, 2B4, NKp46, CD94, KIR, and the NKG2 family of activating receptors (e.g.,
NKG2D). Maturation of NK cells (e.g., TSNK cells) can also be assessed by detecting
specific markers during different developmental stages. For example, in one embodiment,
pro-NK cells are CD34*, CD45RA7, CD10*, CD117- and/or CD161-. In another
embodiment, pre-NK cells are CD34*, CD45RA7, CD1O-, CD117, and/or CD161-. In
another embodiment, immature NK cells are CD34-, CD117, CD16 1, NKp46- and/or
CD94/NKG2A-. In another embodiment, CD 5 6 bright NK cells are CD1 I1, NKp46*,
CD94/NKG2A*, CD16-, and/or KIR/ . In another embodiment, CD56dim NK cells are
CD 117-, NKp46*, CD94/NKG2A-, CD 16+, and/or KIR+. In a specific embodiment,
maturation of NK cells (e.g., TSNK cells) is determined by the percentage of NK cells (e.g.,
TSNK cells) that are CD161-, CD94+ and/or NKp46+. In a more specific embodiment, at
least 10%, 20%, 25 %, 30%, 35%, 40%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65 % or 70% of mature NK cells
(e.g., TSNK cells) are NKp46+. In another more specific embodiments, at least 10%, 20%,
25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% of mature NK cells (e.g., TSNK cells) are CD94+. In

    WO 2012/009422                                                          PCT/US2011/043831
another more specific embodiments, at least 10%, 20%, 25 %, 30%, 35 %, 40%, 45 % or 50%
of mature NK cells (e.g., TSNK cells) are CD161.
[00106] In certain embodiments, the differentiation of hematopoietic cells into NK cells are
assessed by detecting the the expression level of, e.g., CD3, CD7 or CD127, CD10, CD14,
CD15, CD16, CD33, CD34, CD56, CD94, CD117, CD161, NKp44, NKp46, NKG2D,
DNAM-1, 2B4 or TO-PRO-3, using, e.g., antibodies to one or more of these cell markers.
Such antibodies can be conjugated to a detectable label, for example, as fluorescent label, e.g.,
FITC, R-PE, PerCP, PerCP-Cy5.5, APC, APC-Cy7 or APC-H7.
         6.3.    Isolation of TSNK Cells
[00107] Methods of isolating natural killer cells are known in the art and can be used to
isolate the TSNK cells. Natural killer cells can be isolated or enriched by staining cells from
a tissue source, e.g., peripheral blood, with antibodies to CD56 and CD3, and selecting for
CD56CD3- cells. TSNK cells can be isolated using a commercially available kit, for
example, the NK Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). TSNK cells can also be isolated or
enriched by removal of cells other than NK cells in a population of cells that comprise the
TSNK cells. For example, TSNK cells may be isolated or enriched by depletion of cells
displaying non-NK cell markers using, e.g., antibodies to one or more of CD3, CD4, CD14,
CD19, CD20, CD36, CD66b, CD123, HLA DR and/or CD235a (glycophorin A). Negative
isolation can be carried out using a commercially available kit, e.g., the NK Cell Negative
Isolation Kit (Dynal Biotech). Cells isolated by these methods may be additionally sorted,
e.g., to separate CD16- and CD16- cells.
[00108] Cell separation can be accomplished by, e.g., flow cytometry, fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS), or, preferably, magnetic cell sorting using microbeads conjugated with
specific antibodies. The cells may be isolated, e.g., using a magnetic activated cell sorting
(MACS) technique, a method for separating particles based on their ability to bind magnetic
beads (e.g., about 0.5-100 ptm diameter) that comprise one or more specific antibodies, e.g.,
anti-CD56 antibodies. Magnetic cell separation can be performed and automated using, e.g,
an AUTOMACSTM Separator (Miltenyi). A variety of useful modifications can be performed
on the magnetic microspheres, including covalent addition of antibody that specifically
recognizes a particular cell surface molecule or hapten. The beads are then mixed with the
cells to allow binding. Cells are then passed through a magnetic field to separate out cells
having the specific cell surface marker. In one embodiment, these cells can then isolated and
re-mixed with magnetic beads coupled to an antibody against additional cell surface markers.

The cells are again passed through a magnetic field, isolating cells that bound both the
antibodies. Such cells can then be diluted into separate dishes, such as microtiter dishes for
clonal isolation.
         6.4.   Placental Perfusate
[00109] TSNK cells may be produced from hematopoietic cells, e.g., hematopoietic stem or
progenitors from any source, e.g., placental tissue, placental perfusate, umbilical cord blood,
placental blood, peripheral blood, spleen, liver, or the like. In certain embodiments, the
hematopoietic stem cells are combined hematopoietic stem cells from placental perfusate and
from cord blood from the same placenta used to generate the placental perfusate. Placental
perfusate comprising placental perfusate cells that can be obtained, for example, by the
methods disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 7,045,148 and 7,468,276, the disclosures of which are
hereby incorporated in their entireties.
                6.4.1.  Cell Collection Composition
[00110] The placental perfusate and perfusate cells, from which hematopoietic stem or
progenitors may be isolated, or useful in tumor suppression or the treatment of an individual
having tumor cells, cancer or a viral infection, e.g., in combination with the TSNK cells, as
provided herein, can be collected by perfusion of a mammalian, e.g., human post-partum
placenta using a placental cell collection composition. Perfusate can be collected from the
placenta by perfusion of the placenta with any physiologically-acceptable solution, e.g., a
saline solution, culture medium, or a more complex cell collection composition. A cell
collection composition suitable for perfusing a placenta, and for the collection and
preservation of perfusate cells is described in detail in related U.S. Application Publication
No. 2007/0190042, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[00111] The cell collection composition can comprise any physiologically-acceptable
solution suitable for the collection and/or culture of stem cells, for example, a saline solution
(e.g., phosphate-buffered saline, Kreb's solution, modified Kreb's solution, Eagle's solution,
0.9% NaCl. etc.), a culture medium (e.g., DMEM, H.DMEM, etc.), and the like.
[00112] The cell collection composition can comprise one or more components that tend to
preserve placental cells, that is, prevent the placental cells from dying, or delay the death of
the placental cells, reduce the number of placental cells in a population of cells that die, or the
like, from the time of collection to the time of culturing. Such components can be, e.g., an
apoptosis inhibitor (e.g., a caspase inhibitor or JNK inhibitor); a vasodilator (e.g., magnesium

    WO 2012/009422                                                           PCT/US2011/043831
sulfate, an antihypertensive drug, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), adrenocorticotropin,
corticotropin-releasing hormone, sodium nitroprusside, hydralazine, adenosine triphosphate,
adenosine, indomethacin or magnesium sulfate, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, etc.); a
necrosis inhibitor (e.g., 2-(1H-Indol-3-yl)-3-pentylamino-maleimide, pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate, or clonazepam); a TNF-a inhibitor; and/or an oxygen-carrying
perfluorocarbon (e.g., perfluorooctyl bromide, perfluorodecyl bromide, etc.).
[00113] The cell collection composition can comprise one or more tissue-degrading enzymes,
e.g., a metalloprotease, a serine protease, a neutral protease, a hyaluronidase, an RNase, or a
DNase, or the like. Such enzymes include, but are not limited to, collagenases (e.g.,
collagenase I, II, III or IV, a collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum, etc.); dispase,
thermolysin, elastase, trypsin, LIBERASE, hyaluronidase, and the like.
[00114] The cell collection composition can comprise a bacteriocidally or bacteriostatically
effective amount of an antibiotic. In certain non-limiting embodiments, the antibiotic is a
macrolide (e.g., tobramycin), a cephalosporin (e.g., cephalexin, cephradine, cefuroxime,
cefprozil, cefaclor, cefixime or cefadroxil), a clarithromycin, an erythromycin, a penicillin
(e.g., penicillin V) or a quinolone (e.g., ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin), a
tetracycline, a streptomycin, etc. In a particular embodiment, the antibiotic is active against
Gram(+) and/or Gram(-) bacteria, e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Staphylococcus aureus,
and the like.
[00115] The cell collection composition can also comprise one or more of the following
compounds: adenosine (about 1 mM to about 50 mM); D-glucose (about 20 mM to about
100 mM); magnesium ions (about 1 mM to about 50 mM); a macromolecule of molecular
weight greater than 20,000 daltons, in one embodiment, present in an amount sufficient to
maintain endothelial integrity and cellular viability (e.g., a synthetic or naturally occurring
colloid, a polysaccharide such as dextran or a polyethylene glycol present at about 25 g/l to
about 100 g/l, or about 40 g/l to about 60 g/l); an antioxidant (e.g., butylated hydroxyanisole,
butylated hydroxytoluene, glutathione, vitamin C or vitamin E present at about 25 pM to
about 100 pM); a reducing agent (e.g., N-acetylcysteine present at about 0.1 mM to about 5
mM); an agent that prevents calcium entry into cells (e.g., verapamil present at about 2 pM to
about 25 pM); nitroglycerin (e.g., about 0.05 g/L to about 0.2 g/L); an anticoagulant, in one
embodiment, present in an amount sufficient to help prevent clotting of residual blood (e.g.,
heparin or hirudin present at a concentration of about 1000 units/l to about 100,000 units/l);
or an amiloride containing compound (e.g., amiloride, ethyl isopropyl amiloride,

    WO 2012/009422                                                          PCT/US2011/043831
hexamethylene amiloride, dimethyl amiloride or isobutyl amiloride present at about 1.0 pM
to about 5 pM).
                 6.4.2. Collection and Handling of Placenta
[00116] Generally, a human placenta is recovered shortly after its expulsion after birth. In a
preferred embodiment, the placenta is recovered from a patient after informed consent and
after a complete medical history of the patient is taken and is associated with the placenta.
Preferably, the medical history continues after delivery.
[00117] Prior to recovery of perfusate, the umbilical cord blood and placental blood are
removed. In certain embodiments, after delivery, the cord blood in the placenta is recovered.
The placenta can be subjected to a conventional cord blood recovery process. Typically a
needle or cannula is used, with the aid of gravity, to exsanguinate the placenta (see, e.g.,
Anderson, U.S. Patent No. 5,372,581; Hessel et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,415,665). The needle
or cannula is usually placed in the umbilical vein and the placenta can be gently massaged to
aid in draining cord blood from the placenta. Such cord blood recovery may be performed
commercially, e.g., LifeBank Inc., Cedar Knolls, N.J., ViaCord, Cord Blood Registry and
CryoCell. Preferably, the placenta is gravity drained without further manipulation so as to
minimize tissue disruption during cord blood recovery.
[00118] Typically, a placenta is transported from the delivery or birthing room to another
location, e.g., a laboratory, for recovery of cord blood and collection of perfusate. The
placenta is preferably transported in a sterile, thermally insulated transport device
(maintaining the temperature of the placenta between 20-28'C), for example, by placing the
placenta, with clamped proximal umbilical cord, in a sterile zip-lock plastic bag, which is
then placed in an insulated container. In another embodiment, the placenta is transported in a
cord blood collection kit substantially as described in U.S. Patent No. 7,147,626. Preferably,
the placenta is delivered to the laboratory four to twenty-four hours following delivery. In
certain embodiments, the proximal umbilical cord is clamped, preferably within 4-5 cm
(centimeter) of the insertion into the placental disc prior to cord blood recovery. In other
embodiments, the proximal umbilical cord is clamped after cord blood recovery but prior to
further processing of the placenta.
[00119] The placenta, prior to collection of the perfusate, can be stored under sterile
conditions and at either room temperature or at a temperature of 5 to 25'C (centigrade). The
placenta may be stored for a period of longer than forty eight hours, and preferably for a
period of four to twenty-four hours prior to perfusing the placenta to remove any residual

    WO 2012/009422                                                          PCT/US2011/043831
cord blood. The placenta is preferably stored in an anticoagulant solution at a temperature of
5'C to 25'C (centigrade). Suitable anticoagulant solutions are well known in the art. For
example, a solution of heparin or warfarin sodium can be used. In a preferred embodiment,
the anticoagulant solution comprises a solution of heparin (e.g., 1% w/w in 1:1000 solution).
The exsanguinated placenta is preferably stored for no more than 36 hours before placental
perfusate is collected.
                  6.4.3. Placental Perfusion
[00120] Methods of perfusing mammalian placentae and obtaining placental perfusate are
disclosed, e.g., in Hariri, U.S. Patent Nos. 7,045,148 and 7,255,879, and in U.S. Application
Publication Nos. 2007/0190042 and 20070275362, the disclosures of which are hereby
incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.
[00121] Perfusate can be obtained by passage of perfusion solution, e.g., saline solution,
culture medium or cell collection compositions described above, through the placental
vasculature. In one embodiment, a mammalian placenta is perfused by passage of perfusion
solution through either or both of the umbilical artery and umbilical vein. The flow of
perfusion solution through the placenta may be accomplished using, e.g., gravity flow into
the placenta. Preferably, the perfusion solution is forced through the placenta using a pump,
e.g., a peristaltic pump. The umbilical vein can be, e.g., cannulated with a cannula, e.g., a
TEFLON@ or plastic cannula, that is connected to a sterile connection apparatus, such as
sterile tubing. The sterile connection apparatus is connected to a perfusion manifold.
[00122] In preparation for perfusion, the placenta is preferably oriented in such a manner that
the umbilical artery and umbilical vein are located at the highest point of the placenta. The
placenta can be perfused by passage of a perfusion solution through the placental vasculature,
or through the placental vasculature and surrounding tissue. In one embodiment, the
umbilical artery and the umbilical vein are connected simultaneously to a pipette that is
connected via a flexible connector to a reservoir of the perfusion solution. The perfusion
solution is passed into the umbilical vein and artery. The perfusion solution exudes from
and/or passes through the walls of the blood vessels into the surrounding tissues of the
placenta, and is collected in a suitable open vessel from the surface of the placenta that was
attached to the uterus of the mother during gestation. The perfusion solution may also be
introduced through the umbilical cord opening and allowed to flow or percolate out of
openings in the wall of the placenta which interfaced with the maternal uterine wall. In
another embodiment, the perfusion solution is passed through the umbilical veins and

    WO 2012/009422                                                          PCT/US2011/043831
collected from the umbilical artery, or is passed through the umbilical artery and collected
from the umbilical veins, that is, is passed through only the placental vasculature (fetal tissue).
[00123] In one embodiment, for example, the umbilical artery and the umbilical vein are
connected simultaneously, e.g., to a pipette that is connected via a flexible connector to a
reservoir of the perfusion solution. The perfusion solution is passed into the umbilical vein
and artery. The perfusion solution exudes from and/or passes through the walls of the blood
vessels into the surrounding tissues of the placenta, and is collected in a suitable open vessel
from the surface of the placenta that was attached to the uterus of the mother during gestation.
The perfusion solution may also be introduced through the umbilical cord opening and
allowed to flow or percolate out of openings in the wall of the placenta which interfaced with
the maternal uterine wall. Placental cells that are collected by this method, which can be
referred to as a "pan" method, are typically a mixture of fetal and maternal cells.
[00124] In another embodiment, the perfusion solution is passed through the umbilical veins
and collected from the umbilical artery, or is passed through the umbilical artery and
collected from the umbilical veins. Placental cells collected by this method, which can be
referred to as a "closed circuit" method, are typically almost exclusively fetal.
[00125] The closed circuit perfusion method can, in one embodiment, be performed as
follows. A post-partum placenta is obtained within about 48 hours after birth. The umbilical
cord is clamped and cut above the clamp. The umbilical cord can be discarded, or can
processed to recover, e.g., umbilical cord stem cells, and/or to process the umbilical cord
membrane for the production of a biomaterial. The amniotic membrane can be retained
during perfusion, or can be separated from the chorion, e.g., using blunt dissection with the
fingers. If the amniotic membrane is separated from the chorion prior to perfusion, it can be,
e.g., discarded, or processed, e.g., to obtain stem cells by enzymatic digestion, or to produce,
e.g., an amniotic membrane biomaterial, e.g., the biomaterial described in U.S. Application
Publication No. 2004/0048796. After cleaning the placenta of all visible blood clots and
residual blood, e.g., using sterile gauze, the umbilical cord vessels are exposed, e.g., by
partially cutting the umbilical cord membrane to expose a cross-section of the cord. The
vessels are identified, and opened, e.g., by advancing a closed alligator clamp through the cut
end of each vessel. The apparatus, e.g., plastic tubing connected to a perfusion device or
peristaltic pump, is then inserted into each of the placental arteries. The pump can be any
pump suitable for the purpose, e.g., a peristaltic pump. Plastic tubing, connected to a sterile
collection reservoir, e.g., a blood bag such as a 250 mL collection bag, is then inserted into
the placental vein. Alternatively, the tubing connected to the pump is inserted into the

   WO 2012/009422                                                               PCT/US2011/043831
placental vein, and tubes to a collection reservoir(s) are inserted into one or both of the
placental arteries. The placenta is then perfused with a volume of perfusion solution, e.g.,
about 750 ml of perfusion solution. Cells in the perfusate are then collected, e.g., by
centrifugation.
[00126] In one embodiment, the proximal umbilical cord is clamped during perfusion, and
more preferably, is clamped within 4-5 cm (centimeter) of the cord's insertion into the
placental disc.
[00127] The first collection of perfusion fluid from a mammalian placenta during the
exsanguination process is generally colored with residual red blood cells of the cord blood
and/or placental blood. The perfusion fluid becomes more colorless as perfusion proceeds
and the residual cord blood cells are washed out of the placenta. Generally from 30 to 100
mL of perfusion fluid is adequate to initially flush blood from the placenta, but more or less
perfusion fluid may be used depending on the observed results.
[00128] The volume of perfusion liquid used to perfuse the placenta may vary depending
upon the number of placental cells to be collected, the size of the placenta, the number of
collections to be made from a single placenta, etc. In various embodiments, the volume of
perfusion liquid may be from 50 mL to 5000 mL, 50 mL to 4000 mL, 50 mL to 3000 mL,
100 mL to 2000 mL, 250 mL to 2000 mL, 500 mL to 2000 mL, or 750 mL to 2000 mL.
Typically, the placenta is perfused with 700-800 mL of perfusion liquid following
exsanguination.
[00129] The placenta can be perfused a plurality of times over the course of several hours or
several days. Where the placenta is to be perfused a plurality of times, it may be maintained
or cultured under aseptic conditions in a container or other suitable vessel, and perfused with
a cell collection composition, or a standard perfusion solution (e.g., a normal saline solution
such as phosphate buffered saline ("PBS") with or without an anticoagulant (e.g., heparin,
warfarin sodium, coumarin, bishydroxycoumarin), and/or with or without an antimicrobial
agent (e.g., P-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mM); antibiotics such as streptomycin (e.g., at 40-100
ptg/ml), penicillin (e.g., at 40U/ml), amphotericin B (e.g., at 0.5 [tg/ml). In one embodiment,
an isolated placenta is maintained or cultured for a period of time without collecting the
perfusate, such that the placenta is maintained or cultured for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, or 24 hours, or 2 or 3 or more days before
perfusion and collection of perfusate. The perfused placenta can be maintained for one or
more additional time(s), e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24 or more hours, and perfused a second time with, e.g., 700-800 mL perfusion

    WO 2012/009422                                                          PCT/US2011/043831
fluid. The placenta can be perfused 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more times, for example, once every 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 or 6 hours. In a preferred embodiment, perfusion of the placenta and collection of
perfusion solution, e.g., placental cell collection composition, is repeated until the number of
recovered nucleated cells falls below 100 cells/ml. The perfusates at different time points can
be further processed individually to recover time-dependent populations of cells, e.g., total
nucleated cells. Perfusates from different time points can also be pooled.
                6.4.4. Placental Perfusate and Placental Perfusate Cells
[00130] Typically, placental perfusate from a single placental perfusion comprises about 100
million to about 500 million nucleated cells, including hematopoietic cells from which TSNK
cells may be produced by the method disclosed herein. In certain embodiments, the placental
perfusate or perfusate cells comprise CD34 cells, e.g., hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells.
Such cells can, in a more specific embodiment, comprise CD34m CD45- stem or progenitor
cells, CD34m CD45 stem or progenitor cells, or the like. In certain embodiments, the
perfusate or perfusate cells are cryopreserved prior to isolation of hematopoietic cells
therefrom. In certain other embodiments, the placental perfusate comprises, or the perfusate
cells comprise, only fetal cells, or a combination of fetal cells and maternal cells.
         6.5.   TSNK Cells
[00131] In one aspect, provided herein are TSNK cells, the NK cells produced by the
methods described herein (e.g., two-step method). Further provided herein is a population of
cells comprising the TSNK cells produced by the methods described herein (e.g., two-step
method). In a specific embodiment, said NK cells (e.g., TSNK cells) are CD3-CD56.           In a
specific embodiment, said NK cells (e.g., TSNK cells) are CD3-CD56 mCD16-. In another
specific embodiment, said NK cells (e.g., TSNK cells) are additionally CD94m CD117+. In
another specific embodiment, said NK cells (e.g., TSNK cells) are additionally CD161-. In
another specific embodiment, said NK cells (e.g., TSNK cells) are additionally NKG2D.          In
another specific embodiment, said NK cells are additionally NKp46.        In another specific
embodiment, said said NK cells are additionally CD226.
[00132] In certain embodiments, greater than 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 92%, 94%, 96%,
98% of said TSNK cells are CD56 and CD16-. In other embodiments, at least 50%, 60%,
70%, 80%, 82%, 84%, 86%, 88% or 90% of said TSNK cells are CD3- and CD56.                In other
embodiments, at least 50%, 52%, 54%, 56%, 58% or 60% of said TSNK cells are NKG2D.
In other embodiments, fewer than 30%, 20%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4% or 3% of said
cells are NKB1m . In certain other embodiments, fewer than 30%, 20%, 10%, 8%,6%, 4% or

    WO 2012/009422                                                                PCT/US2011/043831
2% of said TSNK cells are NKAT2*. In certain other embodiments, fewer than 30%, 20%,
10%, 8%, 6%, 4% or 2% of said TSNK cells are CD56* and CD16*. In more specific
embodiments, at least 10%, 20%, 250%, 30%, 350%, 40%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 650%or 7 0% of
said CD3-, CD56* TSNK cells are NKp46*. In other more specific embodiments, at least
10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 7 0%, 75%, 80% or 85% of said
CD3-, CD56* TSNK cells are CD117.            In other more specific embodiments, at least 10%,
20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% of said CD3-, CD56* TSNK cells are CD94*. In
other more specific embodiments, at least 10%, 20%, 250%, 30%, 350%, 40%, 450% or 50% of
said CD3-, CD56* TSNK cells are CD161-. In other more specific embodiments, at least
10%, 12%, 14%, 16%, 18% or 20% of said CD3-, CD56* TSNK cells are CD226*. In more
specific embodiments, at least 20%, 25%, 30%, 35% or 40% of said CD3-, CD56* TSNK
cells are CD7.     In more specific embodiments, at least 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55% or
60% of said CD3-, CD56* TSNK cells are CD5.
[00133] In various other embodiments, TSNK cells can be combined with, e.g., NK cells,
wherein said NK cells have been isolated from a tissue source and have not been expanded;
NK cells isolated from a tissue source and expanded, or NK cells produced by a different
method, e.g., CD56*CD16- natural killer cells, e.g., in ratios of, for example, about 1:10, 2:9,
3:8, 4:7:, 5:6, 6:5, 7:4, 8:3, 9:2, 1:10, 1:9, 1:8, 1:7, 1:6, 1:5, 1:4, 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1,
6:1, 7:1, 8:1 or about 9:1. As used in this context, "isolated" means that the cells have been
removed from their normal tissue environment.
[00134] TSNK cells can have a fetal genotype or a maternal genotype. For example, because
the post-partum placenta, as a source of hematopoietic cells suitable for producing TSNK
cells, comprises tissue and cells from the fetus and from the mother, placental perfusate can
comprise fetal cells only, or a substantial majority of fetal cells (e.g., greater than about 90%,
95%, 98% or 99%), or can comprise a mixture of fetal and maternal cells (e.g., the fetal cells
comprise less than about 90%, 80%, 7 0%, 60%, or 50% of the total nucleated cells of the
perfusate). In one embodiment, the TSNK cells are derived only from fetal placental
hematopoietic cells, e.g., cells obtained from closed-circuit perfusion of the placenta wherein
the perfusion produces perfusate comprising a substantial majority, or only, fetal placental
hematopoietic cells. In another embodiment, the TSNK cells are derived from fetal and
maternal cells, e.g., cells obtained by perfusion by the pan method (see above), wherein the
perfusion produced perfusate comprising a mix of fetal and maternal placental cells. Thus, in
one embodiment, provided herein is a population of placenta-derived intermediate natural
killer cells, the substantial majority of which have the fetal genotype. In another embodiment,

provided herein is a population of placenta-derived intermediate natural killer cells that
comprise natural killer cells having the fetal genotype and natural killer cells having the
maternal phenotype.
[00135] Also provided herein are populations of TSNK cells that comprise natural killer cells
not produced by the methods described herein. For example, in one embodiment, provided
herein is a population of TSNK cells that also comprises natural killer cells isolated from, e.g.,
umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, bone marrow, or a combination of two or more of the
foregoing, or NK cells expanded by a method other than the methods described herein. Such
populations of TSNK cells can comprise the TSNK cells and other NK cells in, e.g., a ratio of
about 1:10, 2:9, 3:8, 4:7:, 5:6, 6:5, 7:4, 8:3, 9:2, 10:1, 1:9, 1:8, 1:7, 1:6, 1:5, 1:4, 1:3, 1:2, 1:1,

1:75, 1:80, 1:85, 1:90, 1:95, or about 1:100, or the like.
[00136] In certain embodiments, the isolated natural killer cells (e.g., TSNK cells) or
populations enriched for natural killer cells (e.g., TSNK cells) can be assessed by detecting
one or more functionally relevant markers, for example, CD94, CD 161, NKp44, DNAM- 1,
2B4, NKp46, CD94, KIR, and the NKG2 family of activating receptors (e.g., NKG2D). In
some embodiments, the purity of the isolated or enriched natural killer cells can be confirmed
by detecting one or more of CD56, CD3 and CD 16.
[00137] Optionally, the cytotoxic activity isolated or enriched natural killer cells can be
assessed, e.g., in a cytotoxicity assay using tumor cells, e.g., cultured K562, LN-18, U937,
WERI-RB-1, U-i 18MG, HT-29, HCC2218, KG-i, or U266 tumor cells, or the like as target
cells.
        6.6.     TSNK Cells In Combination With Placental Perfusate
[00138] Further provided herein are compositions comprising TSNK cells in combination
with placental perfusate, placental perfusate cells and/or adherent placental cells, e.g., for use
in suppressing the proliferation of a tumor cell or plurality of tumor cells.
                 6.6.1.  Combinations of TSNK Cells and Perfusate or Perfusate Cells
[00139] Further provided herein are compositions comprising combinations of the TSNK
cells and placental perfusate and/or placental perfusate cells. In one embodiment, for
example, provided herein is a volume of placental perfusate supplemented with TSNK cells.

    WO 2012/009422                                                             PCT/US2011/043831
In specific embodiments, for example, each milliliter of placental perfusate is supplemented
with about 1 x 104, 5 x 104, 1 x 10', 5 x 10', 1 x 10', 5 x 10', 1 x 107, 5 x 107, 1 x 10', 5 x 10'
or more TSNK cells. In another embodiment, placental perfusate cells are supplemented with
TSNK cells. In certain other embodiments, when placental perfusate cells are combined with
TSNK cells, the placental perfusate cells generally comprise about, greater than about, or
fewer than about, 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 8%, 6%, 4%, 2% or
1%   of the total number of cells. In certain other embodiments, when TSNK cells are
combined with a plurality of placental perfusate cells and/or combined natural killer cells, the
NK cells generally comprise about, greater than about, or fewer than about, 50%, 45%, 40%,
35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 8%, 6%, 4%, 2% or 1% of the total number of cells. In
certain other embodiments, when TSNK cells are used to supplement placental perfusate, the
volume of solution (e.g., saline solution, culture medium or the like) in which the cells are
suspended comprises about, greater than about, or less than about, 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%,
30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 8%, 6%, 4%, 2% or 1% of the total volume of perfusate plus
cells, where the TSNK cells are suspended to about 1 x 104 , 5 x 104, 1 X 105, 5 x 105, 1 x 106,
5 x 106, 1 x 107 , 5 x 107, 1 x 108, 5 x 108 or more cells per milliliter prior to supplementation.
[00140] In other embodiments, any of the above combinations of cells is, in turn, combined
with umbilical cord blood or nucleated cells from umbilical cord blood.
[00141] Further provided herein is pooled placental perfusate that is obtained from two or
more sources, e.g., two or more placentas, and combined, e.g., pooled. Such pooled perfusate
can comprise approximately equal volumes of perfusate from each source, or can comprise
different volumes from each source. The relative volumes from each source can be randomly
selected, or can be based upon, e.g., a concentration or amount of one or more cellular factors,
e.g., cytokines, growth factors, hormones, or the like; the number of placental cells in
perfusate from each source; or other characteristics of the perfusate from each source.
Perfusate from multiple perfusions of the same placenta can similarly be pooled.
[00142] Similarly, provided herein are placental perfusate cells, and placenta-derived
intermediate natural killer cells, that are obtained from two or more sources, e.g., two or more
placentas, and pooled. Such pooled cells can comprise approximately equal numbers of cells
from the two or more sources, or different numbers of cells from one or more of the pooled
sources. The relative numbers of cells from each source can be selected based on, e.g., the
number of one or more specific cell types in the cells to be pooled, e.g., the number of CD34
cells, etc.

    WO 2012/009422                                                                PCT/US2011/043831
[00143] Further provided herein are TSNK cells, and combinations of TSNK cells with
placental perfusate and/or placental perfusate cells, that have been assayed to determine the
degree or amount of tumor suppression (that is, the potency) to be expected from, e.g., a
given number of TSNK cells, or a given volume of perfusate. For example, an aliquot or
sample number of cells is contacted with a known number of tumor cells under conditions in
which the tumor cells would otherwise proliferate, and the rate of proliferation of the tumor
cells in the presence of placental perfusate, perfusate cells, placental natural killer cells, or
combinations thereof, over time (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 weeks, or longer) is
compared to the proliferation of an equivalent number of the tumor cells in the absence of
perfusate, perfusate cells, placental natural killer cells, or combinations thereof. The potency
of the cells can be expressed, e.g., as the number of cells or volume of solution required to
suppress tumor cell growth, e.g., by about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%,
or the like.
[00144] In certain embodiments, TSNK cells are provided as pharmaceutical grade
administrable units. Such units can be provided in discrete volumes, e.g., 15 mL, 20 mL, 25
mL, 30 nL. 35 mL, 40 mL, 45 mL, 50 mL, 55 mL, 60 mL, 65 mL, 70 mL, 75 mL, 80 mL, 85
mL, 90 mL, 95 mL, 100 mL, 150 mL, 200 mL, 250 mL, 300 mL, 350 mL, 400 mL, 450 mL,
500 mL, or the like. Such units can be provided so as to contain a specified number of cells,
e.g., TSNK cells alone, or TSNK cells in combination with other NK cells or perfusate cells,
e.g., 1 x 104 , 5 x 104, 1 x 10', 5 x 10', 1 x 106 , 5 x 106, 1 x 107 , 5 x 107, 1 x 10', 5 x 10' or
more cells per milliliter, or 1 x 104, 5 x 104, 1 x 105, 5 x 105, 1 x 106, 5 x 106, 1 x 107, 5 x 107,

1 x 1011 or more cells per unit. Such units can be provided to contain specified numbers of
TSNK cells, and/or any of the other cells.
[00145] In the above embodiments, the TSNK cells or combinations of TSNK cells with
other NK cells, perfusate cells or perfusate can be autologous to a recipient (that is, obtained
from the recipient), or allogeneic to a recipient (that is, obtained from at last one other
individual from said recipient).
[00146] In certain embodiments, each unit of cells is labeled to specify one or more of
volume, number of cells, type of cells, whether the unit has been enriched for a particular
type of cell, and/or potency of a given number of cells in the unit, or a given number of

    WO 2012/009422                                                              PCT/US2011/043831
milliliters of the unit, that is, whether the cells in the unit cause a measurable suppression of
proliferation of a particular type or types of tumor cell.
                 6.6.2.   Combinations of TSNK Cells And Adherent Placental Stem Cells
[00147] In other embodiments, the TSNK cells, either alone or in combination with placental
perfusate or placental perfusate cells, is supplemented with isolated adherent placental cells,
e.g., placental stem cells and placental multipotent cells as described, e.g, in Hariri U.S.
Patent Nos. 7,045,148 and 7,255,879, and in U.S. Patent Application Publication No.
2007/0275362, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their
entireties. "Adherent placental cells" means that the cells are adherent to a tissue culture
surface, e.g., tissue culture plastic. The adherent placental cells useful in the compositions
and methods disclosed herein are not trophoblasts, embryonic germ cells or embryonic stem
cells. In certain embodiments, adherent placental stem cells are used as feeder cells during
the processes (e.g., two-step method) as described above.
[00148] The TSNK cells, either alone or in combination with placental perfusate or placental
perfusate cells can be supplemented with, e.g., 1 x 104, 5 x 104, 1 x 10', 5 x 10', 1 x 106, 5 x
106, 1 X 107, 5 x 107, 1 x 108, 5 x 108 or more adherent placental cells per milliliter, or 1 x 104,
5x   104, 1 x 105, 5x   105, 1 x 106, 5 x 106, 1 X 107, 5x  107, 1 x 108, 5 x 108, 1 x 109 , 5 x 109 , 1
x 1100, 5 x 1010, 1 x 1011 or more adherent placental cells. The adherent placental cells in the
combinations can be, e.g., adherent placental cells that have been cultured for, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, or 40 population
doublings, or more.
[00149] Isolated adherent placental cells, when cultured in primary cultures or expanded in
cell culture, adhere to the tissue culture substrate, e.g., tissue culture container surface (e.g.,
tissue culture plastic). Adherent placental cells in culture assume a generally fibroblastoid,
stellate appearance, with a number of cytoplasmic processes extending from the central cell
body. Adherent placental cells are, however, morphologically distinguishable from
fibroblasts cultured under the same conditions, as the adherent placental cells exhibit a
greater number of such processes than do fibroblasts. Morphologically, adherent placental
cells are also distinguishable from hematopoietic stem cells, which generally assume a more
rounded, or cobblestone, morphology in culture.
[00150] The isolated adherent placental cells, and populations of adherent placental cells,
useful in the compositions and methods provided herein, express a plurality of markers that
can be used to identify and/or isolate the cells, or populations of cells that comprise the

    WO 2012/009422                                                          PCT/US2011/043831
adherent placental cells. The adherent placental cells, and adherent placental cell populations
useful in the compositions and methods provided herein include adherent placental cells and
adherent placental cell-containing cell populations obtained directly from the placenta, or any
part thereof (e.g., amnion, chorion, amnion-chorion plate, placental cotyledons, umbilical
cord, and the like). The adherent placental stem cell population, in one embodiment, is a
population (that is, two or more) of adherent placental stem cells in culture, e.g., a population
in a container, e.g., a bag.
[00151] The adherent placental cells generally express the markers CD73, CD 105, and
CD200, and/or OCT-4, and do not express CD34, CD38, or CD45. Adherent placental stem
cells can also express HLA-ABC (MHC-1) and HLA-DR. These markers can be used to
identify adherent placental cells, and to distinguish the adherent placental cells from other
cell types. Because the adherent placental cells can express CD73 and CD 105, they can have
mesenchymal stem cell-like characteristics. Lack of expression of CD34, CD38 and/or CD45
identifies the adherent placental stem cells as non-hematopoietic stem cells.
[00152] In certain embodiments, the isolated adherent placental cells described herein
detectably suppress cancer cell proliferation or tumor growth.
[00153] In certain embodiments, the isolated adherent placental cells are isolated placental
stem cells. In certain other embodiments, the isolated adherent placental cells are isolated
placental multipotent cells. In a specific embodiment, the isolated adherent placental cells
are CD34-, CD 10* and CD105 as detected by flow cytometry. In a more specific
embodiment, the isolated CD34-, CD10-, CD105- adherent placental cells are placental stem
cells. In another more specific embodiment, the isolated CD34-, CD10, CD105 placental
cells are multipotent adherent placental cells. In another specific embodiment, the isolated
CD34-, CD 10-, CD 105 placental cells have the potential to differentiate into cells of a
neural phenotype, cells of an osteogenic phenotype, or cells of a chondrogenic phenotype. In
a more specific embodiment, the isolated CD34-, CD10-, CD105- adherent placental cells are
additionally CD200*. In another more specific embodiment, the isolated CD34-, CD10,
CD105+ adherent placental cells are additionally CD90+ or CD45-, as detected by flow
cytometry. In another more specific embodiment, the isolated CD34-, CD10, CD105
adherent placental cells are additionally CD90+ or CD45-, as detected by flow cytometry. In
a more specific embodiment, the CD34-, CD10, CD105+, CD200+ adherent placental cells
are additionally CD90+ or CD45-, as detected by flow cytometry. In another more specific
embodiment, the CD34-, CD10, CD105+, CD200+ adherent placental cells are additionally
CD90+ and CD45-, as detected by flow cytometry. In another more specific embodiment, the

                 6.6.3.  Compositions Comprising Adherent Placental Cell Conditioned Media
[00164] Also provided herein is the use of a composition comprising TSNK cells and
additionally conditioned medium, wherein said composition is tumor suppressive, or is
effective in the treatment of cancer or viral infection. Adherent placental cells as described in
Section 6.6.2, above can be used to produce conditioned medium that is tumor cell
suppressive, anti-cancer or anti-viral that is, medium comprising one or more biomolecules
secreted or excreted by the cells that have a detectable tumor cell suppressive effect, anti
cancer effect or antiviral effect. In various embodiments, the conditioned medium comprises
medium in which the cells have proliferated (that is, have been cultured) for at least 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or more days. In other embodiments, the conditioned medium
comprises medium in which such cells have grown to at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%,
80%, 90% confluence, or up to 100% confluence. Such conditioned medium can be used to
support the culture of a separate population of cells, e.g., placental cells, or cells of another
kind. In another embodiment, the conditioned medium provided herein comprises medium in
which isolated adherent placental cells, e.g., isolated adherent placental stem cells or isolated
adherent placental multipotent cells, and cells other than isolated adherent placental cells, e.g.,
non-placental stem cells or multipotent cells, have been cultured.
[00165] Such conditioned medium can be combined with any of, or any combination of
TSNK cells, placental perfusate, placental perfusate cells to form a composition that is tumor
cell suppressive, anticancer or antiviral. In certain embodiments, the composition comprises
less than half conditioned medium by volume, e.g., about, or less than about, 50%, 45%, 40%,

        6.7.    Preservation of Cells
[00169] Cells, e.g., TSNK cells or placental perfusate cells comprising hematopoietic stem
cells or progenitor cells, can be preserved, that is, placed under conditions that allow for long
term storage, or under conditions that inhibit cell death by, e.g., apoptosis or necrosis.
[00170] Placental perfusate can be produced by passage of a cell collection composition
through at least a part of the placenta, e.g., through the placental vasculature. The cell
collection composition comprises one or more compounds that act to preserve cells contained
within the perfusate. Such a placental cell collection composition can comprise an apoptosis
inhibitor, necrosis inhibitor and/or an oxygen-carrying perfluorocarbon, as described in
related U.S. Application Publication No. 20070190042, the disclosure of which is hereby
incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[00171] In one embodiment, perfusate or a population of placental cells are collected from a
mammalian, e.g., human, post-partum placenta by contacting the perfusate or population of
cells with a cell collection composition comprising an inhibitor of apoptosis and an oxygen
carrying perfluorocarbon, wherein said inhibitor of apoptosis is present in an amount and for
a time sufficient to reduce or prevent apoptosis in the population of placental cells, e.g.,
adherent placental cells, for example, placental stem cells or placental multipotent cells, as
compared to a population of cells not contacted with the inhibitor of apoptosis. For example,
the placenta can be perfused with the cell collection composition, and placental cells, e.g.,
total nucleated placental cells, are isolated therefrom. In a specific embodiment, the inhibitor

   WO 2012/009422                                                            PCT/US2011/043831
of apoptosis is a caspase inhibitor. In another specific embodiment, said inhibitor of
apoptosis is a JNK inhibitor. In a more specific embodiment, said JNK inhibitor does not
modulate differentiation or proliferation of adherent placental cells, e.g., adherent placental
stem cells or adherent placental multipotent cells. In another embodiment, the cell collection
composition comprises said inhibitor of apoptosis and said oxygen-carrying perfluorocarbon
in separate phases. In another embodiment, the cell collection composition comprises said
inhibitor of apoptosis and said oxygen-carrying perfluorocarbon in an emulsion. In another
embodiment, the cell collection composition additionally comprises an emulsifier, e.g.,
lecithin. In another embodiment, said apoptosis inhibitor and said perfluorocarbon are
between about 00 C and about 25 0 C at the time of contacting the placental cells. In another
more specific embodiment, said apoptosis inhibitor and said perfluorocarbon are between
about 20C and 10 C, or between about 20C and about 50C, at the time of contacting the
placental cells. In another more specific embodiment, said contacting is performed during
transport of said population of cells. In another more specific embodiment, said contacting is
performed during freezing and thawing of said population of cells.
[00172] In another embodiment, placental perfusate and/or placental cells can be collected
and preserved by contacting the perfusate and/or cells with an inhibitor of apoptosis and an
organ-preserving compound, wherein said inhibitor of apoptosis is present in an amount and
for a time sufficient to reduce or prevent apoptosis of the cells, as compared to perfusate or
placental cells not contacted with the inhibitor of apoptosis. In a specific embodiment, the
organ-preserving compound is UW solution (described in U.S. Patent No. 4,798,824; also
known as VIASPAN TM; see also Southard et al., Transplantation49(2):251-257 (1990) or a
solution described in Stern et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,552,267, the disclosures of which are
hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. In another embodiment, said organ
preserving composition is hydroxyethyl starch, lactobionic acid, raffinose, or a combination
thereof. In another embodiment, the placental cell collection composition additionally
comprises an oxygen-carrying perfluorocarbon, either in two phases or as an emulsion.
[00173] In another embodiment of the method, placental cells are contacted with a cell
collection composition comprising an apoptosis inhibitor and oxygen-carrying
perfluorocarbon, organ-preserving compound, or combination thereof, during perfusion. In
another embodiment, placental cells are contacted with said cell collection compound after
collection by perfusion.
[00174] Typically, during placental cell collection, enrichment and isolation, it is preferable
to minimize or eliminate cell stress due to hypoxia and mechanical stress. In another

    WO 2012/009422                                                          PCT/US2011/043831
embodiment of the method, therefore, placental perfusate or a population of placental cells is
exposed to a hypoxic condition during collection, enrichment or isolation for less than six
hours during said preservation, wherein a hypoxic condition is a concentration of oxygen that
is less than normal blood oxygen concentration. In a more specific embodiment, said
perfusate or population of placental cells is exposed to said hypoxic condition for less than
two hours during said preservation. In another more specific embodiment, said population of
placental cells is exposed to said hypoxic condition for less than one hour, or less than thirty
minutes, or is not exposed to a hypoxic condition, during collection, enrichment or isolation.
In another specific embodiment, said population of placental cells is not exposed to shear
stress during collection, enrichment or isolation.

[00223 Cytotoxicity assay using PKH26/TO-PRO-3 labeling. The target tumor cells were
labeled with PKH26 (Cat#PKH26GL, Sigma-Aldrich), a dye that inserts into cell plasma
membrane via its lipophilic aliphatic residue, then placed in 96-well U-bottom tissue culture
plates and incubated with expanded NK cells at various effector-target (E:T) ratios in 200tl
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. Cultures were incubated for 4 hours at 37'C in
5% CO 2 . After incubation, cells were harvested and TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen Cat# T3605), a
membrane-impermeable DNA stain, was added to cultures (1 pM final concentration)

(PKH26+TO-PRO-3+) within the total PKH26+ target tumor cells.
[00224] Optimization of CD34+cell expansion and differentiation into NK cells. Among the
medium formulations tested, NK1, NK2 and NK3, NK1 medium showed a 500-fold
expansion on Day 21 (D2 1). Neither NK2 nor NK3 medium maintained either cell
proliferation or differentiation. Further medium optimization was performed for NK1
medium and the subsequent media were named NK2A, NK2B, NK2C and NK2D. CD34
cells cultured with NK2A medium showed a 105 -fold expansion on Day 55 (D55). Based on
the results from fold expansion, differentiation, and cytotoxicity from NK1, 2 and 3 medium,
the second batch of NK2A, NK2B, NK2C and NK2D medium formulations were performed
and on D55, a 105-fold expansion was achieved (as shown in FIG 1). NK2B medium showed
an approximately 3 x 104 -fold expansion. Culture in NK2C medium resulted in 3 x 102 -fold
expansion in 21 days, followed by declined cell viability. NK2D medium did not maintain
cells through the duration of the experiment.
[00225] On Day 48 (D48), around 90% of the NK cells in NK2A medium were CD56VCD3-.
Within the CD56VCD3- population, over 98% of cells were CD56VCD16- (as shown in FIG
2), while 58% expressed the activating receptor NKG2D, 68% were NKp46 and 17% were
CD226 (as shown in Tables 4A and 4B).

        7.3.    Example 3: Culture of NK Cells In CNK Medium
                Enhances Expansion And Cytotoxicity Of NK Cells
[00227] On Day 27 (D27), CD34* cells cultured in NK2A medium were further cultured in
one of the following media:
    e   Two-stage Medium, which comprises CNK Medium and Maintenance Medium.
        CNK Medium is IMDM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS (Hyclone), 200
        IU/mL IL-2 (R&D Systems), 35 [tg/mL transferrin (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 ptg/mL insulin
        (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 x 10-5M ethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 [ig/mL oleic acid
        (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 [tg/niL linoleic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2 pig/mL palmitic acid
        (Sigma-Aldrich), 2.5 ptg/mL BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1 ptg/mL
        phytohemagglutinin (PHA-P, Sigma-Aldrich). CD56*CD3- NK cells cultured in
        NK2A medium were resuspended at 2.5x 105 live cells/mL in CNK Medium in cell
        culture treated 24-well plates or T flasks. Mitomycin C-treated allogeneic PBMC and
        K562 cells (chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line) were both added to the CNK
        Medium as feeder cells, to a final concentration of 1 x 106 per mL. NK cells were
        cultured for 5-6 days at 37'C in 5% CO 2 . After 5-6 days and then every 3-4 days an
        equal volume of Maintenance Medium (IMDM with 10% FCS, 2% Human AB serum,
        antibiotics, L-glutamine and 400 units of IL-2 per mL) was added to the culture.
    *   NK2A (PDAC) medium with mitomycin C treated CD34-, CD10-, CD105, CD200*
        tissue culture plastic-adherent placental stem cells as feeder cells;
    *   NK2A (MSC) medium with mitomycin C treated mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) as
        feeder cells; or
    *   Feeder-free NK2A (FF) medium as the control.
[00228] Two-stage medium enhanced the fold-expansion of the CD34* cells compared to
NK2A (FF), NK2A (PDAC) and NK2A (MSC), particularly between Day 27 (D27) and Day
48 (D48). See Figure 3.
[00229] By Day 35, the proportion of CD34* cells had already decreased to approximately
4% while the proportion of CD56*CD3- had increased to approximately 80% in the Two
stage medium. On Day 45 (D45), cells cultured in Two-stage medium showed highest
cytotoxicity as compared to NK cells cultured in NK2A (FF), NK2A (PDAC) and NK2A
(MSC) (as shown in Figure 3). Phenotypic characterization at Day 41 (as shown in Figure 5)
showed increased expression of NKp46 and CD226 in the cells, indicating a possible
explanation for the enhancement of cytotoxicity. At D41 the proportion of CD226* cells
increased from 0.9%  0.8% in NK2A medium to 13%  4% in Two-stage medium; the

proportion of NKp46 cells increased from 55.4%  8.7% in NK2A medium to 80%  7.85%
in Two-Stage medium. At D48 the proportion of CD226+ cells increased from 17.3%
14.3% in NK2A medium to 52.3%  11.64% in Two-Stage medium; the proportion of
NKp46 cells increased from 67.9%  5.4% in NK2A medium to 86%  4% in Two-Stage
medium. There was no significant difference of NKG2D expression among the conditions
tested. Changes in expression of CD226 and NKp46 are shown in Table 5, below.

        7.4.   Example 4: Comparison of Two-Stage Medium-Cultivated Natural Killer
               Cells and Natural Killer Cells Derived from Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs)
[00230] NK cells cultured in the Two-stage medium were compared with NK cells derived
from embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which were produced by the method of Woll et al., Blood
113(4):6094-6101 (2009). Specifically, a difference in expression levels of CD94 and
CD 117 was observed during the process of cultivation of both of the cell types. Figure 6
shows that the expression of CD 117 was high in the Two-stage NK cells, or "+", from Day 7
(D7) to Day 35 (D35), while the expression of CD94 gradually increased. On Day 35 (D35),
about 44% of the CD56VCD3- (Two-step) cells were CD94VCD117+ cells, 37.6% of the
CD56VCD3- cells were CD94-CD117+ and 14.7% of the CD56VCD3- cells were
CD94VCD 117-. As such, the NK cells produced by the Two-step method are distinguishable
from the NK cells derived from ESCs, 78% of which remained CD1 171ow/_ from Day 14 to
Day 35 of the cultivation. This difference in CD1 17 expression is useful because CD1 17+

    WO 2012/009422                                                         PCT/US2011/043831
NK cells are cytotoxic towards tumor cell lines from various tissues, as described in Example
6, below.
[00231] These results suggest that the differentiation progression of TSNK cells is different
from ESC-derived NK cells, and that TSNK cells are distinguishable from ESC derived NK
cells.
        7.5.    Example 5: PDACs Enhance Fold Expansion of
                Cultured Natural Killer Cells in NK2A Medium
[00232] To assess the effect of CD1O*, CD34-, CD105, CD200- tissue culture plastic
adherent placental stem cells (referred to in this Example as PDACs) on hematopoietic stem
cell (HSC) differentiation to natural killer cells, HSCs were stimulated with mitomycin C
treated PDACs or bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) at a ratio of 10:1
PDACs/MSC:HSC on Day 0 and Day 21, while a feeder-free culture was used as the control.
NK2A medium was used as culture medium. PDACs were found to enhance the fold
expansion of cultured NK cells compared to medium alone. However, no significant
difference in cytotoxicity between cells grown with or without the feeder layer was found.
Cells treated with MSC showed the highest fold expansion, but the lowest cytotoxicity, as
shown in Figure 7.
        7.6.    Example 6: Cytotoxic Activity of NK Cells Expanded Using Two-Stage
                Medium
[00233] This Example demonstrates that NK cells produced from CD34* cells expanded and
differentiated using the Two-stage process described above are cytotoxic to tumor cell lines.
[00234] Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)release assay. The LDH release assay was performed
using CYTOTOX 96@ non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega, Cat# G1780). In this
assay, cultured NK cells derived from donor-matched human placental perfusate (HPP) and
cord blood units (Combos units) were used as effector cells, while certain tumor cell line cells
were used as target cells. From three units used in this study, the percentage of HPP cells
was 56.6%  28.3%. Effector cells and target cells were placed in 96-well U-bottom tissue
culture plates and incubated at various effector-target (E:T) ratios in 100 tl RPMI 1640
without phenol red (Invitrogen, Cat# 11835-030) supplemented with 2% human AB serum
(Gemini, Cat# 100-512). Cultures were incubated for 4 hours at 37 0 C in 5% CO 2 . After
incubation, 50 tl supernatant was transferred to enzymatic assay plate, LDH activity was
detected as provided by the manufacturer, and absorption was measured at 490 nm in an
ELISA reader (Synergy HT, Biotek). The cytotoxicity was calculated according to the

    WO 2012/009422                                                          PCT/US2011/043831
following equation: % Cytotoxicity     = (Sample - Effector Spontaneous - Target
Spontaneous)/(Target maximum-Target Spontaneous)*100, where "Effector Spontaneous" is
a control for the spontaneous release of LDH from effector cells; "Target Spontaneous" is a
control for the spontaneous release of LDH from target cells; and "Target Maximum" is a
control for the maximum LDH release when essentially 100% of cells are lysed.
[00235 Isolation of Human PlacentalPerfusate (HPP)CD34+ Cells and Umbilical Cord
Blood (UCB) CD34+ Cells. HPP and UCB cells were purified using either Ficoll or
ammonium chloride to obtain total nucleated cells (TNCs). TNCs were then used in a
positive selection procedure to isolate CD34* cells using anti-CD34 beads and RoboSep
following the protocol provided by the manufacturer (StemCell Technologies, Inc.) In this
experiment, CD34* cells were isolated with greater than 90% purity.
[00236 Study of tumor cell susceptibility to cultured two-stage NK cells. Tumor cell lines
(Table 1), including human breast cancer (HCC2218), human colorectal adenocarcinoma
(HT-29), human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), human acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), human glioblastoma (LN- 18 and U-118MG), human multiple myeloma (U266),
human histiocytic lymphoma (U937), and human retinoblastoma (WERI-RB-1) were co
cultured with two-stage NK cells. The two-stage cultured NK cells included those cultured in
NK2A medium for 21 days, then cultured in CNK Medium for 21 days, and those cultured in
NK2A medium for 28 days and then CNK Medium for 14 days. The NK cell cytotoxicity
was measured by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay after 4-hour co-culture. At
effector to target (E:T) ratio of 10:1 the latter generally showed higher cytotoxicity than the
former (Table 6). Of the tumor cell lines, LN-18 was the most susceptible to NK-mediated
killing, followed by K562, U937, WERI-RB-1, U-i 18MG, HT-29, HCC2218, KG-I and
U266.
[00237] TSNK cells therefore showed significant cytotoxicity toward various cancer cell
lines. It further appears that the NK cytotoxicity can be improved by prolonging the culture
period in NK2A medium from 21 days to 28 days.

MicroRNA Profilingof Human PlacentalPerfusate (HPP)CD34+ Cells and Umbilical Cord
Blood (UCB) CD34+ Cells. Purified donor-matched HPP and UCB CD34+ cells were
subjected to microRNA (miRNA) preparation using a MIRVANA TM miRNA Isolation Kit
(Ambion, Cat# 1560). CD34* cells (0.5 to 1.5 x 106 cells) were disrupted in a denaturing
lysis buffer. The samples were then subjected to acid-phenol+chloroform extraction to
isolate RNA highly enriched for small RNA species. 100% ethanol was added to bring the
samples to 25% ethanol. When this lysate/ethanol mixture was passed through a glass fiber
filter, large RNA species were immobilized, and the small RNA species were collected in the
filtrate. The ethanol concentration of the filtrate was then increased to 55%, and the mixture
was passed through a second glass fiber filter where the small RNAs became immobilized.
This RNA was washed a few times, and eluted in a low ionic strength solution. The
concentration and purity of the recovered small RNA was determined by measuring its
absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. miRNAs found to be unique for HPP CD34+ cells in all
donors tested (n=3) included hsa-miR-380, hsa-miR-512, hsa-miR-517, hsa-miR-518c, hsa
miR-519b, and hsa-miR-520a.
          7.7.   Example 7: Isolation of CD34* Cells from pooled UCB and HPP
[00238] This example demonstrates the isolation of CD34* cells from pooled umbilical cord
blood (UCB) and human placental perfusate (HPP) (Combo). To evaluate the UCB:HPP
pooling ratio, side-by-side comparisons of 3 different pooling ratios were performed as as
follows: (1) Full pooling: 1x UCB (full volume) + 1x HPP (full volume); (2) Partial pooling
of HPP (33%): 1x UCB (full volume) + 0.33x HPP (1/3 of HPP volume); and (3) Partial
pooling of HPP (10%): 1x UCB (full volume) + 0.1Ox HPP (1/10 of HPP volume). A total of
N=3 experimental replicates were executed. The initial TNC and volumes were recorded.
The pooled samples were then purified for CD34* cells and CD34* purity was determined
post-thaw. The optimal pooling ratio was then determined graphically from the post-thaw
CD34* purity vs. volumetric or cell count (TNC) fractions (as a % of Combo) plots. As
shown in Figure 8, the end-point CD34* purity correlates well with the HPP volume content,

but not as much with the HPP TNC content. Overall, UCB 85% v/v, HPP 15% v/v was
found to to be the optimal pooling ratio to obtain CD34 cells with purity of 80% and above.
        7.8.    Example 8: Comparison of NK Cell Cultivation Using GBGM@-based media
[00239] This example desmonstrates the comparison of NK cell cultivation processes using
two GBGM-based media (the three-stage process and two-stage process). The two processes
are summaried in Table 10. Both processes utilized GBGM as the basal medium for the
differentiation of NK cells and CD34 cells of placenta in origin.

[00245] Seeding density: 20000 - 50000 cells / mL
[00246] CD34* cells from either fresh UCB or fresh combo were generated and
cryopreserved with methods described in Examples 7, 10 and 11. Cultures were maintained
in a 37 0C, >90% humidity, and 5% CO 2 incubator. Cell growth was monitored throughout
(cell count) and medium exchanges were performed twice per week to maintain cell
concentrations within the range of 5x10 4 - 1x10 6 per mL. Differentiation was monitored by
phenotypic analysis at Day 21 and 35. When feeders were used, at Day 21 of NK cultivation,
fresh 3-day cultured K562 and post-thaw allo-PBMC were inactivated with mitomycin-C (16
ptg/mL, 2 hrs, 37 0C) and were added to the two-stage process conditions at 1x106 per mL.
The differentiating NKs were normalized to 0.5x106 per mL. At Day35, after final cell
counts were performed, a flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity assay using freshly cultured and
PKH labeled K562 cells (10:1 E:T ratio, 4 hr, 37 0C) was performed to evaluate NK
functionality.
[00247] Results
[00248] The median of the TNC expansion fold for CD34* cells derived from fresh UCB
using the two processes were comparable at Day 35. The two-stage process appeared to yield
higher TNC expansion fold than the three-stage process for fresh combo-derived CD34* cells.
The overall TNC expansion folds were comparable for the CD34* cells derived from post
thaw combo using both processes, but were significantly lower than those derived from fresh
UCB or fresh combo. In all, both the three-stage and two-stage processes yielded similar cell
yield at end of cultivation.
[00249] At Day 21, there were no noticeable differences of phenotype on cells originated
from UCB or Combo. The two-stage process resulted in a higher percentage of CD56*CD3
NK cells (avg. 14.7%) than the three-stage process (avg. 6.10%). The extent of differentiation
(e.g., CD56*CD3- level) appeared to be donor-dependent. The percentage of both
CD3CD56- (T-cells) and CD3CD56* (NKT-like cells) populations were minimal in all
cases.
[00250] At Day 35, both processes were found to be effective for differentiating NK cells, as
evidenced by the high end-point CD56*CD3- purity levels (87.2% and 90.l1% for the two
stage and three-stage processes, respectively). The addition of feeders in the two-stage
process appeared to enhance NK phenotypic purity (75.3% without feeders; 87.2% with

    WO 2012/009422                                                         PCT/US2011/043831
feeders), while no observable benefit of feeders on NK purity was found (90.l1% without
feeders; 84.7% with feeders) with the three-stage process.
[00251] Cultivated NK cells maintained their CD16- phenotype throughout. The two-stage
process appeared to yield slightly more CD56CD3 cells in the absence of feeders (avg.
11.2%) than the other conditions (< 2%). The presence of PBMC and K562 feeders in both
processes significantly upregulated/activated certain NK functional markers (NKp46,
DNAM-1, CD94) on the NK cell population. Overall, the NK purity and functional marker
expression profiles were found to be comparable between the two processes, when the feeder
conditions are identical.
[00252] The functionality of cultivated NK cells, as determined by the 4 hour in vitro K562
cytotoxicity assay, was found to be comparable between the two processes when feeder
conditions are identical. Feeder-activated NK cells were highly effective in killing K562
cells in vitro, with average specify lysis of 93.2% and 93.6% specific lysis for the two-stage
and three-stage processes, respectively.
[00253] In summary, the two-stage and three-stage processes were found to yield comparable
growth, phenotype (purity and activation markers), and in vitro functionality for NK cells
when the same feeder condition was used. The two-stage process offers the ease and
convenience of culturing NK cells compared to the three-stage process.
        7.9.     Example 9: Comparison of NK Cell Cultivation Using Various Basal Media
[00254] This study is aimed to evaluate the differentiation and expansion of CD34-derived
NK cells using different basal media.
[00255] The experimental conditions are summarized in Table 11. The cells were cultured as
described in Example 11. All experiments were setup in the scale of multiwell dishes/T
flasks and were maintained in a 37 0C, >90% humidity, and 5% CO 2 incubator. Cell growth
was monitored throughout (cell count) and medium exchanges were performed twice per
week to maintain cell concentrations within the range of 5x10 4 - 1x10 6 per mE.
Differentiation was monitored by phenotypic analysis at Day 21 and 35. At Day 21, fresh 3
day cultured K562 and post-thaw allo-PBMC were inactivated and were added to developing
NK cell culture at 1x10 6 per mL. The NK cells were normalized to 0.5x10 6 per mL. At
Day35, after final cell counts were performed, a flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity assay
using freshly cultured and PKH labeled K562 cells (10:1 E:T ratio, 4 hr, 37 0C) was carried
out to evaluate NK functionality.

[00256] Growth yield

DMEM:F12 w/ 5 mM OAC showed lower growth yield than GBGM.
[00258] Phenotypic analysis
[00259] At Day 35 (end-point), GBGM yielded about 80% purity of CD56+CD3- cells.
OpTmizer and Stemspan H3000 yielded about 50% purity of CD56+CD3- cells. DMEM:F12
produced about 35% purity of CD56+CD3- cells. AIM-V, X-VIVO 10, X-VIVO 15, and
Cellgro media produced about <30% purity of CD56+CD3- cells. The addition of OAC to
DMEM:F12 basal medium during culture was found to greatly enhance the end-point NK
purity; the percentage of CD56+CD3- at Day 35 of culture increased from 35% to 72%.
[00260] Cytotoxicity/Functionality
[00261] The addition of 5 mM OAC to DMEM:F12 basal medium during culture was found
to greatly enhance the activation status and in vitro functionality of NK cells. The addition of
OAC also significantly increased the level of NK activation markers NKp46, NKG2D,
DNAM-1, and CD94. The in vitro functionality (K562 cytotoxicity) of Day-35 NK cells
increased substantially as well, from 21.4% to 97.1 % %.

[00262] Overall, the NK cell properties were significantly enhanced from the addition of 5
mM OAC.
        7.10.   Example 10: Storage and Cryopreservation of NK Cells
[00263] This Example demonstrates the methods of storing and cryopreserving NK cells.
CD34* hematopoietic stem cells isolated from human placental perfusate (HPP) and
umbilical cord blood cells were expanded and differentiated into NK cells using the protocols
described in the previous examples. Cells were cryoprevered right after being isolated from
HPP and umbilical cord blood (at Day 0) or during the first growth phase of the NK cells (at
Day 9, Day 14, Day 21 or Day 35 post isolation).
[00264] The cells were cryopreserved in the following cryopreservation formulations:
Formulation 1-dextran cryo medium: 5% DMSO (Sigma Aldrich, D2650), 55% dextran (10%
w/v in normal saline) (10% LMD in 0.9% sodium chloride injection, Hospira), 40% HAS
(Octapharma); Formulation 2 - Trehalose cryo medium: 5% DMSO, 55% trehalose (10% w/v
in normal saline), 40% HSA; Formulation 3 - CryoStor@ CS2 (BioLife Solutions);
Formulation 4 - CryoStor@ CS5 (BioLife Solutions); Formulation 5 - CryoStor@CS 10
(BioLife Solutions); Formulation 6 - Serum-free freezing media (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# 6295);
Formulation 7 - Glycerol freezing media (Sigma-Aldrich, CAT# C6039); or Formulation 8
DMSO and serum-free freezing media (Sigma-Aldrich, CAT# 2639).
[00265] Cells collected at different ime points were washed several times with culture media
or saline solution. The cells were then centrifuged to obtain cell pellets. The supernatants
were removed, and the cells pellets were suspended with cryopreservation media to about 1 x
106 - 1.5 x 107 or more cells per milliliter. The cell suspension was aliquoted to ImL or 2 mL
septum vials and incubated at 2-8'C for approximately 10 minutes. Subsequently, the cells
were frozen in a control rate freezer (Thermo) at 0.5 'C/min. Frozen vials were transferred to
a cryogenic freezer for storage in liquid nitrogen vapor. Cryopreserved NK cells can be
thawed quickly in a 37'C water bath with gentle swirling of the samples until all visible ice
melted. The cell samples can be diluted with pre-warmed culture media.

cord blood (at Day 0) or during the first growth phase of the NK cells (at Day 9, Day 14, Day

[00267] A Cell Suspension Solution was prepared by combining Dextran-40 and HSA in the
ration of 60% Dextran-40 v/v, 40% HSA (from a 25% solution) v/v).
[00268] A 2x Freezing Solution was prepared with 50% Dextran-40 v/v, 40% HSA (25%
solution) v/v, 10% DMSO v/v. DMSO was first slowly added to the Dextran-40 and mixed
well. Subsequently 25% solution of HSA was added to the solution slowly with mixing. The
resulting solution was mixed well and brought to room temperature prior to use.
[00269] CryopreservationProcedure
[00270] The cell number was estimated and normalized as a cell suspension to 15x 106 in Cell
Suspension Solution. The volume of the cell suspension was determined and an equal
volume of freshly prepared 2x Freezing Solution was slowly added and mixed. The final cell
suspension volume in Freezing Solution was recorded and the distributed to a number of vials.
MycoAlert testing was performed on saved culture supernants to detect mycoplasma
contamination. A post-thaw test was conducted on one retain vial to determine the post-thaw
viability, cell recovery and cell characterization.
        7.12.    Example 12: Analysis of of cryopreserved/thawed NK Cells
[00271] Viability assay. NK cells cryopreserved in various formulations as in Example 10 or
11 were thawed. Cells were frozen at the density of 2 x 106 - 3 x 107 cells/mL. Thawed NK
cells were evaluated for cell viability using the Countess@ Automated Cell Counter
(Invitrogen) at Day 0, Day 3 and Day 18 post thawing compared to fresh cells or prefreeze
cells. Briefly, 10 gl of cell samples were mixed with 10 gl of trypan blue. The cell mixtures
were pipeted into the Countess@ chamber slide. The slide was inserted into the instrument
and the cells were counted. Post-freeze-thaw cells showed cell viability about 80% to > 90%
of viability, depending on different cryopreservation formulations.
[00272] Apoptosis assay. Thawed NK cells were also evaluated for apoptosis using BD
AnnV/PI Apoptosis assay kit at Day 0, Day 3 and Day 18 post thawing. Briefly, cells were
washed twice with 1x cold PBS and re-suspended in 1x binding buffer(BD Annexin V/PI

for 15 minutes. Subsequently, 400 gL of 1x binding buffer was added. The samples were
analyzed within 1 hour. Controls used to set up quadrants and gates were unstained cells,
cells stained with AnnV-FITC only and not PI, cells stained with PI only and not AnnV. The
apoptotic cells were quantified as a % of the population of events gated as "cells" on the size
scatter (FSC vs SSC) plot. The post-freeze-thaw cells showed about 5-25% of dead/late
apoptotic cells and 10- 25% of early apoptotic cells, depending on different cryopreservation
formulations. Overall, formulation 1 (5% DMSO, 55% dextran (10% w/v in normal saline),
40% HAS), formulation 2 (5% DMSO, 55% trehalose (10% w/v in normal saline), 40%
HSA), formulation 4 - CryoStor@ CS5 (BioLife Solutions), and formulation 5
(CryoStor@CS 10 (BioLife Solutions)) showed higher cell viability and lower apoptotic cells
compared to other formulations.

[00273] This example demonstrates the evaluation of In-Process Cryopreserved Cell Banking.
The cell culture was initiated with UCB CD34* cells using the method as described by
Spanholtz et al, PLoS One. 5(2):e9221 (2010) using either HS-AB or FBS as the serum
source. The cell concentration was determined and adjusted, and the medium was
replenished as needed. At Day 7, 9, 10 or 14, approximately 106 - 3 x 106 cells were
removed from the cell culture, centrifuged and resuspended in cryopreservation medium
(5.5% v/v Dextran-40, 10% v/v HSA, 5% v/v DMSO). The cells were frozen in a controlled
rate freezer and transferred to liquid phase nitrogen storage for cryopreservation.
Approximately 1 mL cells each vial were cryopreserved at a concentration ranging from 106
-  10 7 per mL. The remaining culture was carried forward to the end-point (Day35), referred
to as "Fresh (no in-process cryopreservation)". Phenotypic analyses were performed on Day
21, 28, and 35 of the cell culture. In vitro functionality (K562 cytotoxicity, 10:1 E:T) was
assessed at Day35 (end-point) of the culture.
[00274] Post-thaw performance of the in-process cryopreserved culture samples (Day 9 and
14) were evaluated as follows. The cell bank vials were quickly thawed in the 37 0 C water
bath. The cells were then diluted with RPMI-FBS medium, centrifugated, resuspended, and
seeded in culture media. Each of the culture conditions were then carried forward to Day35,
cumulative from the start of culture process. Analytics (cell count, viability, phenotypic
analysis, functionality assessment) were done in the same manner as their "Fresh"
counterpart.

[00276] Day 9, 10, and 14 in-process cryopreserved samples all yielded excellent post-thaw
viability, regardless of in-process time point or cell concentration (96.2%- 9 7 .3 % Trypan Blue
negative, 86.1%-93.2% Annexin-V negative / TO-PRO-3 negative). The in-process banking
did not have negative effects on end-of-culture (Day35) yield loss. The final cell yield
between either Day9 or 14 post-thaw and "fresh" conditions are comparable, with either HS
AB or HS-AB as the serum source.
[00277] The phenotypic profiles of maturing NK cells at Day 21/28/35 time points were
found to be quite comparable between the "Fresh" and "Post-Thaw" culture, respectively.
The phenotypic purity (CD56CD3-) was found to be comparable as well. The expression of
certain NK functional markers (CD94, NKG2D) were slightly different due to run-to-run
variabilities.
[00278] In the K562 cytotoxicity assay, the Day9/14 post-thaw cultured NK cells were found
to yield ~0- 2 0 % lower specific K562 lysis readout comparing to non in-process
cryopreserved cultured NK cells. However, given the expression levels of surface markers
relevant to NK cytotoxic function (DNAM1, NKp46, NKG2D, etc.) were not concurrently
reduced, the trend would need to be confirmed with additional donors and assay repeats.
Overall, in-process cryopreservation at Day9/14 of cultivation had minimal impact on process
outcome.
        7.14.    Example 14: Development of Post-thaw medium for NK cell dosing
[00279] This example demonstrates the development of post-thaw medium for NK cell
dosing in animals. The effects of injection media and cell density were tested on NK cell's
viablilty, cytotoxicity, cell recovery and clump formation. Viability was assessed by trypan
blue staining; cytotoxicity was assessed by FACS (10:1 ratio of NK:K562) and clump
formulation was assessed by microscopic assay. Results are shown in Tables 9-12 for the
various types of injection media and cell density.

[00280] The results showed that the Plasmalyte+1 %HSA injection media maintained NK
cells with better viability and cytotoxicity than PBS+1%FBS injection media. Cytotoxicity
also decreased over time after the cells were suspended in injection media. There was no cell
density effect observed on viability and cytotoxicity when cells were suspended in
Plasmalyte+1%HSA. NK cells also settled down in PBS+1%FBS or Plasmalyte+1%HSA
media after 1 hour; however, cells did not appear to aggregate. Finally, there was no obvious
loss of cell recovery and viability observed from the freezing-thawing process.

[00281] The effects of various HSA concentrations were also tested on the NK cell's viability,
cytotoxicity, cell recovery and clump formation. The same methods were utilized from

[00282] The results show that viability was maintained well over 4 hour post-thaw in all three
injection media tested. Also, cytotoxicity decreased over time in all three injection media.
However, the level of reduction was smaller in higher concentrations of HSA whereas
Plasmalyte+5%HSA maintained the highest cytotoxicity. It was also observed that NK cells
did not aggregate in all three injection media. Overall, Plasmalyte appears to be a better
injection medium candidate than PBS.
        7.16.   Example 17: Cultivation of NK cells without IL-2
[00283] This example demonstrates cultivation of NK cells in the absence of IL-2. Cell
culture was performed by the two-stage process described in Example 11. Five different
concentration of IL-2 in the first medium was tested: 0, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 U/mL.
[00284] The results indicate that developing NK cells in culture did not appear to respond to
IL-2 on growth. The putiry of NK cells did not appear to depend on IL-2: the NK cells
differentiate into CD56VCD3- phenotype in theabsence of IL-2. The combination of IL-7, IL
15 and SCF appeared to be sufficient for in vitro NK cell development.
