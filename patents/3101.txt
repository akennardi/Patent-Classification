   Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a method of
10 community gaming and a gaming system for implementing the
   method.    In the embodiment, the method of gaming includes
   initiating a community game having a prize pool in
   response to an initiation condition being met by a first
   player, conducting the community game for the first player
15 and one or more further players to determine a winner of
   the community game, and making an award of a first prize
   from the prize pool to the first player which only the
   first player is eligible upon determining said first
   player as the winner of the community game or making an
20 award of a second prize from the prize pool to one of the
   further players upon determining said one of the further
   players as the winner of the community game.
   General System Configuration
25
   Depending on the embodiment, the gaming system for
   implementing the above method may take a number of
   different forms.    In one form, shown in Figure 1, a gaming
   system 40 includes a community game controller 70 in
30 communication with a plurality of gaming devices 100a,
   100b,..., 100n.  The community game controller 70 is
   arranged to conduct a community game for participating
   players of the plurality of gaming devices 100a, 100b,...,
   100n to determine a winner of the community game.                   In one
35 arrangement, the community game controller 70 is in data
   communication with a plurality of linked gaming devices
   100a, 100b,..., 100n, and the data communication may be
                                              10356504_1 (GHMatters) P83247.AU.4 13/06/18

                                   6
   performed over a network, such as the Internet.
   In the form shown in Figure 1, each gaming device 100a,
   100b,...,  100n has respective main game controllers 60a,
 5 60b,...,  60n arranged to conduct a main game for each player
   of the respective gaming devices 100a, 100b,...,           100n.            In
   an embodiment, a portion of amounts wagered in each main
   game contribute to a prize pool for the community game.
   The prize pool is used to pay out a first prize, such as a
10 jackpot, for which only the first player is eligible or a
   second prize for one of the further players depending on
   who is the winner of the game.     In this embodiment, each
   gaming device has respective player interfaces 50a, 50b,...,
   50n including game play mechanisms to allow respective
15 player input in the main game and the community game.                         In
   the main game, players input wagers using the respective
   player interfaces 50a, 50b,..., 50n.   In the community game,
   players input a selection using the respective player
   interfaces 50a, 50b,...,  50n to participate in the community
20 game, which is then used for determining a winner of the
   community game.
   Gaming Devices
25 Herein, the term gaming device is used to refer to any
   device used by a player to play a game and specifically
   includes stand alone gaming machines and interactive video
   terminals which implement games in a client/server
   architecture.
30
   A gaming device in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2.     The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
35 by a player.     A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
                                               10356504_1 (GHMatters) P83247.AU.4 13/06/18

                                 7
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
 5 reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   Other gaming machines may be configured for ticket
   in that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
10 shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
15 reading device.   In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
20 the player marketing module.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.         Further
25 artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
30 The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
35 electromechanical device.   The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
                                             10356504_1 (GHMatters) P83247.AU.4 13/06/18

                                 8
   type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
 5 different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
10 processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.   Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
15 memory 103.
   The gaming machine 100 has hardware meters 104 for
   purposes including ensuring regulatory compliance and
   monitoring player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface
20 105 for communicating with peripheral devices of the
   gaming machine 100.  The input/output interface 105 and/or
   the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with
   their own memory for storing associated instructions and
   data for use with the input/output interface or the
25 peripheral devices.  A random number generator module 113
   generates random numbers for use by the processor 102.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the
   reference to random numbers includes pseudo-random
   numbers.
30
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
35 mechanism), a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110, a
   coin output mechanism 111, and at least one speaker 115.
                                             10356504_1 (GHMatters) P83247.AU.4 13/06/18

                                9
   Additional hardware may be included as part of the gaming
   machine 100, or hardware may be omitted as required for
   the specific implementation.   For example, while buttons
   or touch screens are typically used in gaming machines to
 5 allow a player to place a wager and initiate a play of a
   game any input device that enables the player to input
   game play instructions may be used.   For example, in some
   gaming machines a mechanical handle is uses to initiate a
   play of the game.
10
   The game controller 101 determines based on game rules
   stored in memory 103, the outcomes of games including
   whether to award a win to a player.
15 In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
20 database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                    In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module - i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
25 communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
30 103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.   The mass storage device
35 103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
                                             10356504_1 (GHMatters) P83247.AU.4 13/06/18

                                10
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
 5 input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   A gaming device as indicated above may also be a gaming
   client of a client/server architecture where a portion of
10 the game is executed on the client and a portion of the
   game is executed on the server.  In such embodiments, the
   client typically takes the form of an interactive video
   terminal which has a similar outward appearance to the
   gaming machine described above but the terminal is only
15 responsible for limited functions, for example rendering
   graphically game outcomes generated by a server.               Further
   detail of a client/server gaming architecture may be found
   in WO 2006/052213 and WO 2007/086779, the disclosures of
   which are incorporated herein by reference.
20
   Further detail of gaming system and method
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
25 network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
30 machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
35
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
                                            10356504_1 (GHMatters) P83247.AU.4 13/06/18

                                 11
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
 5 promotional or informational material.
   In an embodiment, the game server 205 provides a community
   game controller 70  (shown in Figure 6) to conduct a
   community game for the plurality of gaming machines 202,
10 in addition to a main game conducted on the gaming
   machines by respective game controllers, herein referred
   to as main game controllers 60.
   A database management server 206 may manage storage of
15 game programs and associated data for downloading or
   access by the gaming devices 202 in a database 206A.
   Typically, if the gaming system enables players to
   participate in a Jackpot game, a Jackpot server 207 will
   be provided to perform accounting functions for the
20 Jackpot game.  A loyalty program server 212 may also be
   provided.  In an example, the database management server
   206 may manage a prize pool for the community game in
   which contributions from main game are made.            In addition,
   one prize for an eligible player may be a progressive
25 jackpot from the prize pool.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
30 licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.    An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
35 The gaming network 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
                                              10356504_1 (GHMatters) P83247.AU.4 13/06/18

                                12
   for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
 5 server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
10 Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
15 terminals.
   In an embodiment, the game server 205 provides a community
   game controller 70 to conduct a community game for one or
   more gaming machines 202.  A community game may have
20 different game rules, which may be stored in database
   206A, to a main game played on the plurality of gaming
   machines however it is to be appreciated that these rules
   may be the same.  Also, community games may enable players
   of gaming machines to either play against other players,
25 against a computer generated opponent, typically generated
   by the game server 205, or compete to achieve a
   predetermined outcome.  In one embodiment, players of the
   gaming machines 202 compete against other players to
   select a lowest unique number in a designated range of
30 numbers to be determined as the winner of the community
   game.
   It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art
   that an initiation condition to initiate a community game
35 may be determined from an event occurring in a main game,
   such as a triggering event (e.g. 3 scatter symbols in a
   spinning reel type main game),  and may be determined by
                                             10356504_1 (GHMatters) P83247.AU.4 13/06/18

                                 13
   either the respective main game controllers 60a, 60b,
   60n or the server 205 providing the community game
   controller 70.   In one example, the main game controller
   60a determines an initiation condition as being met in a
 5 main game by a player of the gaming device 100a and the
   community game controller 70 is subsequently advised to
   initiate a community game.   In the example, after the
   initiation condition is met, the main game controller 60
   prompts the player to make a wager to play for a first
10 prize which only the player is eligible.     In an example,
   the first prize is a progressive jackpot from the prize
   pool and the value of the wager is half of the credits
   accrued in the main game(s) played by the player.                  It will
   be appreciated however that the wager may be some other
15 value, such as a designated value, or there may be no
   wager at all.   Also, the player's wager may contribute to
   the prize pool.   The community game is subsequently
   initiated and further players are invited to participate
   in the community game for a second prize.       In an example,
20 the second prize corresponds in value to the credits
   accrued in the respective main game(s) of the further
   players however it will be appreciated that the second
   prize may also be some other value, such as any designated
   value.  In any event, the community game is then conducted
25 for the participating players to determine a winner so
   that a corresponding prize can be awarded.
   Referring now to Figure 6, there is shown a single gaming
   device with player interface 50 and main game controller
30 60 in communication with a community game controller 70.
   It would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that
   the community game controller 70 may be provided by the
   game server 205 as described above.
35 The player operates game play mechanism 56 of the player
   interface 50 to make a selection and input game
   instructions, selected from a plurality of available
                                             10356504_1 (GHMatters) P83247.AU.4 13/06/18

                                 14
   instructions, to the main game controller 60.            The player
   interface 50 may vary from embodiment to embodiment but
   will typically include a credit mechanism 52 to enable a
   player to input credits and receive payouts, one or more
 5 displays 54, the game play mechanism 56, and one or more
   speakers  (not shown).  The game play mechanism 56 of the
   player interface 50 may be in the form of an input device
   such as a touch screen and/or buttons to input player
   instructions to the main game controller 60.
10
   The main game controller 60 is in data communication with
   the player interface 50 and typically includes a processor
   62 to process game play instructions in accordance with
   game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
15 display 54.   Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:               a
20 microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   In an embodiment, the main game controller 60 conducts a
25 main game, in accordance with game play rules, in response
   to a wager being placed by a player operating the game
   play mechanism 56, and a contribution from the wager (e.g.
   a percentage of fixed amount) is made to the prize pool of
   the community game by the community game module 624
30 communicating contribution details to the community game
   controller 70.   The main game controller 60 includes an
   outcome generator 622, which operates in response to the
   player's operation of game play mechanism 56 to generate a
   main game outcome, which will then be evaluated by an
35 outcome evaluator 623.    The outcome evaluator 623
   evaluates the generated main game outcome and a community
   game module 624, incorporated within the main game
                                              10356504_1 (GHMatters) P83247.AU.4 13/06/18

                                15
   controller 60, includes an initiation condition determiner
   626 to evaluate the main game outcome to determine whether
   an initiation condition has been met.  For example, the
   initiation condition determiner 626 will evaluate the main
 5 game outcome to determine whether symbols occurring in the
   main game correspond to an initiation condition being met.
   In another example, the community game controller 70
   advises the main game controller 60 and, in turn, the
   community game module 624 that an initiation condition has
10 been met, such as when the prize pool reaches a designated
   value or a specific gaming device has been selected.
   Referring to an example of a spinning reel type main game,
   the outcome generator 622 generates a main game outcome by
15 employing random number generator 621 to randomly select
   symbols from a set of symbols specified by symbol data
   641.  The selected symbols are advised to the display
   controller 625 which causes them to be displayed on the
   display 54 at a set of display positions.      When selecting
20 symbols, the random number generator 621 may select
   symbols from the set of symbols 641 to correspond to an
   initiation condition for a community game.       For example,
   symbols, such as scatter symbols, may be employed in the
   main game according to the main game rules and may also
25 trigger the community game.
   The outcome evaluator 623 evaluates the main game outcome
   generated by the outcome generator 622, which is displayed
   as symbols arranged at a set of display positions, to
30 determine if the outcome corresponds to a winning
   combination specified in the prize data 642A based on game
   rules 642.  For example, the game rules of the main game
   may specify that all combinations are evaluated left to
   right or can be evaluated right to left or both.               Also, to
35 obtain a desired return to player, a probability table
   having weighted outcomes may be stored in the game rules
   642 and employed when selecting the symbols.          In addition,
                                            10356504_1 (GHMatters) P83247.AU.4 13/06/18

                                16
   further rules for determining initiation conditions for
   the community game may also be stored in memory 64, such
   as specifying which symbols are to be displayed at which
   designated display positions  (e.g. at a designated win
 5 line) to constitute an initiation condition.           Also, the
   game rules 642 may contain a probability table employed to
   determine how often an initiation condition is to be met
   by a player.
10 As described, the community game is a different game to
   the main game with different rules.   The rules of the
   community game are stored in memory 74 as game rule data,
   and the value of the prize pool is updated and also stored
   in the memory 74 as prize pool data 742.     The community
15 game controller 70 also includes a community game outcome
   determiner 722 to determine the outcome of the game in
   accordance with the stored rules.   In an alternative
   embodiment, the outcome evaluator 623 of each gaming
   device may perform this function.   Also, the community
20 game may be displayed on the display 54 via the display
   controller 625 so that a player operating the player
   interface 50 can participate in the community game.
   In an example, the community game rules specify that the
25 winner of the community game is the player having selected
   a lowest unique number in a designated range of numbers.
   For example, a first player of a linked gaming device
   triggers a community game from a main game by obtaining 3
   scatter symbols in the main game, which is determined by
30 the initiation condition determiner 626 as an initiation
   condition.   The first player then places a wager via the
   game play mechanism 56 to play for a first prize in the
   form of a jackpot, which only the first player is
   eligible, to initiate the community game and invite
35 players of other linked gaming devices to participate in
   the community game and play for a different prize.                   In the
   example, the players of other linked gaming devices play
                                             10356504_1 (GHMatters) P83247.AU.4 13/06/18

                                 17
   for prizes corresponding in value to the respective values
   of credits accrued in the respective main games, i.e. to
   double the value of their accrued credits.        It will be
   appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that in
 5 some embodiments the further players may be required to
   place a wager to participate in the community game or
   otherwise obtain eligibility, such as by having played
   their main game in a defined time period.
10 In the example, the community game controller 70 is in
   data communication with the linked gaming devices, which
   may be arranged in remote banks of gaming devices.                   For
   example, some banks of linked gaming devices may be
   located in a casino in one state while other banks may be
15 located in a casino in another state.   In any case, each
   of the plurality of linked gaming devices has a main game
   controller 60 and each is arranged to contribute to a
   prize pool for a community game, the value of which is
   stored as prize pool data 742 in the memory 74 of the
20 connected community game controller 70.    The main games
   will typically be different for some of the gaming
   devices.
   As described, the initiation condition determiner 624 of a
25 first linked gaming device determines that an outcome of a
   main game meets an initiation condition and the community
   game module 624 advises this to the player via the display
   controller 625.   In another example, the player is
   provided the opportunity to initiate the community game by
30 placing a wager as described, or play another feature game
    (e.g. 15 free spins).  If the player places the wager, the
   community game module 624 advises the community game
   controller 70 to initiate the community game and prompt
   the players of the other linked gaming devices to make a
35 selection of a number in a designated range of numbers
    (e.g. 1 to 100) to participate in the community game and
   play for a corresponding prize.   It will also be
                                             10356504_1 (GHMatters) P83247.AU.4 13/06/18

                                 18
   appreciated by those skilled in the art that the further
   players will be given a designated time period to make
   their selection, after which they will be deemed by the
   community game controller 70 as not participating in the
 5 community game.
   Using the above example, one bank of linked gaming devices
   may include three gaming devices, the players of which
   having selected numbers 8, 1 and 4 in the community game
10 respectively.   Also, the other bank of linked gaming
   devices includes three gaming devices, the players of
   which having selected numbers 1, 5 and 4 respectively.                        In
   this example, the player who selected the number 8 was the
   player that initiated (e.g. triggered) the community game
15 and thus the only player eligible for the jackpot prize.
   After these selections were inputted via the respective
   game play mechanisms and communicated to the community
   game controller 70, the community game outcome determiner
20 722 determines a winner of the community game as the
   player having selected a lowest unique number in the range
   of numbers.  As described, if the community game outcome
   determiner 722 determines the player who triggered the
   community game as the winner, the jackpot is made to the
25 first player.   If the community game outcome determiner
   722 determines one of the further players as the winner, a
   prize corresponding to the value of credits accrued in the
   respective main game(s) is made.   It can be seen from the
   above example that the community game outcome determiner
30 722 would determine the player who selected number 5 as
   the winner of the community game so the community game
   controller 70 could make an award of a prize corresponding
   to the value of credits accrued in the respective main
   game(s) to that player.
35
   The method 700 of an embodiment is summarised in Figure 7.
   The method 700 of gaming includes initiating 710 a
                                             10356504_1 (GHMatters) P83247.AU.4 13/06/18

                                 19
   community game having a prize pool in response to an
   initiation condition being met by a first player (e.g.
   three scatter symbols appearing in a main game),               the first
   player and one or more further players participating 820
 5 in the community game by making a selection.            For example,
   the players may make a selection from a designated range
   of numbers  (e.g. 1 to 100) to participate in the community
   game.   The method 700 includes conducting 730 the
   community game for the participating players to determine
10 a winner by determining 740 the winning player based on
   the respective selections of the players.        In the example,
   the winning player is the player who selected a lowest
   unique number in the designated range of numbers.                  The
   method 700 further includes making 750 an award of a first
15 prize  (e.g. a progressive jackpot) from the prize pool to
   the first player which only the first player is eligible
   upon determining the first player as the winner of the
   community game (e.g. having selected the lowest unique
   number),  or making 860 an award of a second prize from the
20 prize pool to one of the further players upon determining
   one of the further players as the winner of the community
   game  (e.g. having selected the lowest unique number).
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
25 above description of the system.    It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
   electronically (e.g. digitally) by a processor.                Persons
   skilled in the art will also appreciate that the method
   could be embodied in program code.    The program code could
30 be supplied in a number of ways, for example on a tangible
   computer readable storage medium, such as a disc or a
   memory  (for example, that could replace part of memory
   103) or as a data signal   (for example, by transmitting it
   from a server).   Persons skilled in the art will
35 appreciate that program code provides a series of
   instructions executable by the processor.
