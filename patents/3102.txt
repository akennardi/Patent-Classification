and

                                                  2
        permitting the fluid to travel beyond the fluid atomizer and out of the nozzle member in
an atomized spray pattern.
[0005] One embodiment of the disclosure provides a method of assembling a nozzle assembly.
The method may include the steps of: providing a nozzle member having a central passage
defined by at least an inner side surface and an inner distal surface; inserting a fluid atomizer
into the central passage of the nozzle member; and with a distal surface of the fluid atomizer
arranged adjacent the inner distal surface of the nozzle member, flexing legs of the fluid
atomizer in a radially-outward direction for engaging each leg of the legs with the inner side
surface of the nozzle member.
[0006] Implementations of the disclosure may include the flexing step being conducted in
response to applying an axial force to a proximal surface of the fluid atomizer.
[0007] Additionally, the applying step may be conducted in response to inserting a distal portion
of a spray gun into the central passage of the nozzle member.
[0008] In some examples, the method may include the steps of: providing a conical cap member
including an axial passage; and inserting a distal stem portion of the nozzle member through the
axial passage of the conical cap member for connecting the conical cap member to the distal
stem portion of the nozzle member. One or more radially outwardly projecting barbs may
extend from an outer side surface of the distal stem portion of the nozzle member.
[0009] In some implementations, the inserting step results in radially engaging and securing the
conical cap member for securing the conical cap member to the nozzle member.
[0010] In other implementations, the legs of the fluid atomizer may include a pair of opposing
legs.
[0011] In some instances, engaging each leg of the legs with the inner side surface of the nozzle
member results in spatially-fixing the fluid atomizer within the central passage of the nozzle
member.
[0012] Another embodiment of the disclosure provides a fluid atomizer. The fluid atomizer
may include a proximal portion having a body, an intermediate portion and a distal portion. The

                                                 3
intermediate portion may include legs connected to the body of the proximal portion. The distal
portion may include a shoulder portion connected to the legs of the intermediate portion. The
intermediate portion may be between the proximal portion and the distal portion. The distal
portion may further include a head portion adjacent to the shoulder portion.
[0013] Implementations of the disclosure may include the proximal portion being integrally
formed with the intermediate portion. The intermediate portion may be integrally-formed with
the distal portion.
[0014] Additionally, the body may include: a proximal surface, a distal surface, an outer side
surface and an inner side surface. The inner side surface defines a passage that extends through
the body from the proximal surface to the distal surface.
[0015] In some examples, each leg of the legs may include: a proximal portion, a distal portion
and an intermediate knee portion between the proximal portion and the distal portion. The
proximal portion of each leg of the legs may be integral with and extends away from the distal
surface of the body.
[0016] In some implementations, as each of the proximal portion and the distal portion of each
leg of the legs extend axially away from the proximal portion and the distal portion, each of the
proximal portion and the distal portion of each leg of the legs extend with a radially outward
component such that the intermediate knee portion of each leg defines a peak of each leg that
may be arranged at a position that may be radially beyond a width defined by the side surface of
the body.
[0017] In other implementations, the distal portion of each leg of the legs may be integral with
and extend away from a proximal surface of the shoulder portion of the distal portion.
[0018] In some instances, the shoulder portion may further include a distal surface and a side
surface between the proximal surface of the shoulder portion and the distal surface of the
shoulder portion.
[0019] Implementations of the disclosure may include the side surface of the shoulder portion
forming a radially inwardly projecting recess that extends along an entire height of the shoulder
portion.

                                                  4
[0020] Additionally, the head portion may axially extend from and may be integral with distal
surface of the shoulder portion. The head portion may include a distal surface and a side surface
between the distal surface of the head portion and the distal surface of the shoulder portion.
[0021] In some examples, the side surface of the head portion may be interrupted by a plurality
of radially inwardly projecting recesses and a plurality of arcuate surfaces. Each arcuate surface
of the plurality of arcuate surfaces may be arranged between radially inwardly projecting
recesses of the plurality of radially inwardly projecting recesses.
[0022] In some implementations, one of the arcuate surfaces of the plurality of arcuate surfaces
of the head portion may be aligned with the radially inwardly projecting recess of the shoulder
portion.
[0023] In other implementations, the body of the proximal portion may be a substantially
circular body.
[0024] In some instances, the legs of the intermediate portion may include a pair of opposing
legs.
[0025] In still yet another embodiment of the disclosure provides a nozzle assembly including a
nozzle member and a fluid atomizer. The nozzle member may include a proximal base portion
and a distal stem portion. The proximal base portion may include an inner side surface that
defines a passage that extends axially through the proximal base portion. The distal stem
portion may include an inner side surface that defines a passage that extends through the distal
stem portion. The fluid atomizer may include a proximal portion, an intermediate portion and a
distal portion. The proximal portion may include a body. The intermediate portion may include
legs connected to the body of the proximal portion. The distal portion may include a shoulder
portion connected to the legs of the intermediate portion. The intermediate portion may be
between the proximal portion and the distal portion. The distal portion may further include a
head portion adjacent to the shoulder portion. The fluid atomizer may be configured to connect
to the nozzle member when the fluid atomizer is arranged within the passage that extends
through the distal stem portion of the nozzle member.

                                                   5
[0026] Implementations of the disclosure may include a conical cap member including an axial
passage configured to accept insertion of the distal stem portion of the nozzle member
therethrough.
[0027] Additionally, the conical cap member may be formed from a soft, resilient material.
[0028] In some examples, one or more radially outwardly projecting barbs may extend from an
outer side surface of the distal stem portion of the nozzle member to radially engage the conical
cap member to the nozzle member.
[0029] In some implementations, the body of the proximal portion may include a substantially
circular body.
[0030] In other implementations, the legs of the intermediate portion may include a pair of
opposing legs.
[0031] In yet another aspect of the disclosure provides a method of utilizing a nozzle assembly
includes the steps of: providing a nozzle member having a central passage defined by at least an
inner side surface and an inner distal surface; assembling the nozzle assembly by inserting a
fluid atomizer into the central passage of the nozzle member; inserting a distal portion of a spray
gun into the central passage of the nozzle member for: firstly urging a distal surface of the fluid
atomizer adjacent the inner distal surface of the nozzle member then secondly flexing legs of the
fluid atomizer in a radially-outward direction in response to an application of an axial force to a
proximal surface of the fluid atomizer for radially engaging the legs with the inner side surface
of the nozzle member; actuating the spray gun for causing a fluid to travel from the spray gun
through the central passage of the nozzle member; atomizing the fluid as the fluid travels
through the central passage of the nozzle member; and permitting the fluid to travel beyond the
fluid atomizer and out of the nozzle member in an atomized spray pattern.
[0032] Additionally, prior to the actuating step, the method includes arranging the nozzle
assembly within a nasal passage of animalia. The fluid may be a drug, medicine or vaccination
that may be delivered into the nasal passage of the animalia in the atomized spray pattern.
[0033] In some examples, the spray pattern may include fluid droplets. The fluid droplets may
be defined by: a D10 particle size distribution value, a D50 particle size distribution value and a

                                                 6
D90 particle size distribution value. The D10 particle size distribution value is greater than
approximately 15 um (microns). The D50 particle size distribution value ranges between
approximately 50-65 um (microns). The D90 particle distribution value is less than
approximately 200 um (microns).
[0034] In some implementations, the D10 particle size distribution value ranges between
approximately 15-25 um, and, the D50 particle size distribution value ranges between
approximately 50-60 um, and, the D90 particle size distribution value ranges between
approximately 180-200 um (microns).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0059] Referring to FIGS. 1A-1B, a nozzle assembly 10 may be removably-connected to a spray
gun, G. As will be described in the following disclosure at FIGS. 8C-8D, the nozzle assembly
10 may be removably-connected to the spray gun, G.
[0060] As seen in FIG. 1A, in some implementations, the nozzle assembly 10 includes a first
portion 12, a second portion 14 and a third portion 16. In some examples, the first portion 12 is
a fluid atomizer. In some examples, the second portion 14 is a nozzle member that receivably
contains the fluid atomizer 12 (as seen in, e.g., FIGS. 8B-8D). In some examples, the third
portion 16 is a conical cap member that is connected to and disposed about an outer surface
portion of a distal end of the nozzle member 14 (as seen in, e.g., FIGS. lB and 8B-8D). The
conical cap member 16 may be made of a soft, resilient material (e.g., foam, rubber or the like).
[0061] Referring to FIG. 1B, upon actuating the spray gun, G (by, e.g., pressing a handle
member, GH, of the spray gun, G), fluid, F, may be guided from a fluid container, C (that is
attached to the spray gun, G), through the spray gun, G, and out of the nozzle assembly 10 such
that the fluid, F, may be sprayed in a pattern. The spray pattern is determined, at least in part, by
an outer surface profile of the fluid atomizer 12 and an inner surface fluid conduit profile of the
nozzle member 14. Although the container, C, is shown mounted to a top portion of the spray
gun, G, the mounting location of the container, C, is not limited to what is shown in the Figures;
for example in some instances, the container, C, may be a tube-shaped structure (not shown) that
is mounted to a rear portion of the spray gun, G.
[0062] In some instances, the spray pattern may be defined by fluid droplets. The fluid droplets
may be described in terms of particle size distributions (i.e., 'D values'). 'D values' of D10,
D50 and D90 may be used to represent the midpoint and range of particle sizes of a given
sample. The D1O particle size is the diameter at which 10% of a sample's mass is comprised of
smaller particles. The D50 may be known as the 'mass median diameter' as it divides the
sample equally by mass. The D90 particle size is the diameter at which 90% of a sample's mass
is comprised of smaller particles. In some examples, the D1O particle size may be greater than
approximately 15 um (microns) in order to minimize tracheobronchial and deep lung deposition
while maintaining a high nasal fraction; and in some examples, the D10 particle size may range
between approximately 15-25 um. In some instances, the D50 particle size may range between

                                                 9
approximately 50-65 um (microns) in order to maximize nasal deposition; and in some instances
the D50 particle size may range between approximately 50-60 um. In some implementations,
the D90 particle size may be less than approximately 200 um (microns) in order to minimize
gastrointestinal dosage; and in some implementations the D90 particle size may range between
approximately 180-200 um.
[0063] In some instances, prior to actuating the spray gun, G, a distal portion of the nozzle
assembly (e.g., including conical cap member 16 attached to the nozzle member 14) may be
arranged within nasal passage (not shown) of animalia. Animalia may include any animal
species including, but not limited to: humans, swine, cows, horses or the like. The fluid, F, that
is dispensed from the nozzle assembly 10 in a spray pattern may be directed into the nasal
passage for administering a drug, medicine, vaccination or the like to the animalia.
[0064] After one or more uses of the spray gun, G, as described above, a user may disconnect
the nozzle assembly 10 from the spray gun, G, in order to unclog or clean the nozzle assembly
10 of obstructions and contaminates, such as, for example, mucus. As will be described in the
following disclosure, upon disconnecting the nozzle assembly 10 from the spray gun, G, the
components 12, 14, 16 of nozzle assembly 10 may easily separate in order to access and clean
each component 12, 14, 16 of nozzle assembly 10.
[0065] Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3A-3C, an exemplary fluid atomizer 12 is shown according to
an embodiment. As seen in FIG. 2, the fluid atomizer 12 generally includes one-piece integral
body having a proximal portion 18, an intermediate portion 20 and a distal portion 22. A central
axis, A-A, is shown extending through an axial center of the fluid atomizer 12.
[0066] The proximal portion 18 includes a substantially circular body 24 having a proximal
surface 26 and a distal surface 28. The substantially circular body 24 also includes an outer side
surface 30 and an inner side surface 31 that both connect the proximal surface 26 to the distal
surface 28. The outer side surface 30 may define the substantially circular body 24 to include a
width 2 4 w. The inner side surface 31 defines a passage 32 that extends through the substantially
circular body 24 from the proximal surface 26 to the distal surface 28.
[0067] The intermediate portion 20 includes a pair of opposing legs 34. Each leg 34a, 34b
includes a proximal portion 36, a distal portion 38 and an intermediate knee portion 40 that joins
the proximal portion 36 to the distal portion 38. The proximal portion 36 of each leg 34a, 34b is

                                                  10
integral with and extends away from the distal surface 28 of the substantially circular body 24.
The distal portion 38 of each leg 34a, 34b is integral with and extends away from a proximal
surface 44 of a shoulder portion 42 of the distal portion 22. As each of the proximal portion 36
and the distal portion 38 of each leg 34a, 34b extends axially away from the proximal portion 18
and the distal portion 22 as described above, each of the proximal portion 36 and the distal
portion 38 of each leg 34a, 34b extends with a radially outward component such that the
intermediate knee portion 40 of each leg 34a, 34b defines a peak 41 of each leg 34a, 34b that is
arranged at a position that may be radially beyond the width     24w  defined by the side surface 30
of the substantially circular body 24.
[0068] The distal portion 22 includes a shoulder portion 42. The shoulder portion 42 includes a
proximal surface 44, a distal surface 46 and a side surface 48 connecting the proximal surface 44
to the distal surface 46. The side surface 48 may define the shoulder portion 42 to include a
diameter   4 2 D. In some instances, the diameter 42D  may subtly narrow along a height 4 2 H of the
shoulder portion 42 as the shoulder portion 42 axially extends from the proximal surface 44
toward the distal surface 46. The diameter    42D  defined by the side surface 48 is interrupted by a
radially inwardly projecting recess 50 formed in the side surface 48. The radially inwardly
projecting recess 50 may be defined by a flat surface 52 that extends along the entire height    42H
of the shoulder portion 42.
[0069] The distal portion 22 also includes a head portion 54 that axially extends from and is
integral with distal surface 46 of the shoulder portion 42. The head portion 54 includes a distal
surface 56 and a side surface 58 connecting the distal surface 56 of the head portion 54 to the
distal surface 46 of the shoulder portion 42. The side surface 58 may define the head portion 54
to include a diameter 5 4 D. In some instances, the diameter 5 4 D may subtly narrow along a
height 5 4 H of the head portion 54 as the head portion 54 axially extends from the distal surface
46 of the shoulder portion 42 toward the distal surface 56 of the head portion 54.
[0070] Referring to FIG. 3C, the side surface 58 is interrupted by a plurality of radially inwardly
projecting recesses 60 formed in the side surface 58. Each radially inwardly projecting recess
60a, 60b, 60c of the plurality of radially inwardly projecting recesses 60 may be defined by a
flat surface 62 that extends along the entire height 5 4 H of the head portion 54. As a result of the
formation of the plurality of radially inwardly projecting recesses 60, the side surface 58 of the

                                                   11
head portion 54 includes a plurality of arcuate surfaces 63 that generally define the diameter      54 D
defined by the side surface 58.
[0071] In some implementations, the plurality of radially inwardly projecting recesses 60 are
defined by three radially inwardly projecting recesses 60a-60c including a first radially inwardly
projecting recess 60a, a second radially inwardly projecting recess 60b and a third radially
inwardly projecting recess 60c. In some implementations the plurality of actuate surfaces 63 are
defined by three arcuate surfaces 63a-63c including a first arcuate surface 63a, a second arcuate
surface 63b and a third arcuate surface 63c. As seen in FIGS. 2 and 3C, in some examples, one
of the arcuate surfaces 63a-63c (e.g., the first arcuate surface 63a) of the plurality of arcuate
surfaces 63 of the head portion 54 is aligned with the radially inwardly projecting recess 50 of
the shoulder portion 42.
[0072] Referring to FIGS. 4-7, an exemplary nozzle member 14 is shown according to an
embodiment. The nozzle member 14 generally includes one-piece integral body having a
proximal base portion 64 and a distal stem portion 66. A central axis, A-A, is shown at FIGS. 4
6 extending through an axial center of the nozzle member 14.
[0073] Referring to FIGS. 4-5, the proximal base portion 64 includes a substantially tube
shaped body 68 having a proximal outer surface 70 and a distal outer surface 72. The
substantially tube-shaped body 68 also includes an outer side surface 74. The outer side surface
74 may define the substantially tube-shaped body 68 to include a diameter        6 8 D. The outer side
surface 74 connects the proximal outer surface 70 to the distal outer surface 72.
[0074] Referring to FIG. 5, the substantially tube-shaped body 68 further includes an inner
surface 76. The inner surface 76 is defined by an inner chamfered side surface 76a, an inner
side surface 76b and an inner distal surface 76c. The inner chamfered side surface 76a includes
a substantially conical surface portion connecting the proximal outer surface 70 to the inner side
surface 76b; the inner chamfered side surface 76a extends away from the proximal outer surface
70 at an angle, 0, which may range between approximately an angle greater than 00 and an angle
less than 90'. The inner side surface 76b includes a threaded surface. The inner distal surface
76c includes a substantially flat surface portion 76ci extending radially inwardly from the inner
side surface 76b toward the central axis, A-A. The inner distal surface 76c also includes a
substantially circumferential rib portion (see, e.g., reference numerals  7 6 c2A, 7 6 c2B) that

                                                        12
circumscribes the central axis, A-A, and projects axially away from the substantially flat surface
portion 76ci of the inner distal surface 76b. The circumferential rib portion includes a
substantially flat surface portion  7 6 c2A  connected to the substantially flat surface portion 76ci.
The circumferential rib portion also includes a chamfered surface portion               7 6 c2B   that extends
radially inwardly from the substantially flat surface portion        7 6 c2A.
[0075] The inner side surface 76 defines a passage 80 that extends through the substantially
tube-shaped body 68. In some instances, the passage 80 may extend between the proximal outer
surface 70 and the inner distal surface 76c such that the passage 80 extends through
approximately about 90% of a length        6 8 L of the  substantially tube-shaped body 68. In some
instances, the passage 80 includes a substantially constant diameter            7 6 cD defined by threaded
inner side surface 76b and a non-constant diameter 7 6 aD defined by the inner chamfered side
surface 76a.
[0076] Access to the passage 80 is permitted by a proximal passage opening 82 and a distal
passage opening 84. The proximal passage opening 82 may be defined by a diameter                          82 D
defined by the connection of the proximal outer surface 70 to the inner chamfered side surface
76a. The distal passage opening 84 may be defined by a diameter               8 4 D.  In some instances the
distal passage opening 84 may be defined by the chamfered surface portion                   7 6 c2B of the
substantially circumferential rib portion of the inner distal surface 76c.
[0077] The diameter    82D  of the proximal passage opening 82 may be approximately equal to the
largest diameter of the non-constant diameter 7 6 aD defined by the inner chamfered side surface
76a. The smallest diameter of the non-constant diameter 7 6 aD defined by the inner chamfered
side surface 76a may be approximately equal to the substantially constant diameter                    7 6 cD defined
by threaded inner side surface 76b. The diameter           84D defined by the distal passage opening 84
is less than the substantially constant diameter      7 6 cD defined by threaded inner side surface 76b.
[0078] With reference to FIGS. 4-5, the distal stem portion 66 includes a substantially tube
shaped body 86 having a distal outer surface 88 and an outer side surface 90. The outer side
surface 90 may define the substantially tube-shaped body 86 to include a diameter                    8 6 D.  The
outer side surface 90 connects the distal outer surface 72 of the tube-shaped body 68 of the
proximal base portion 64 to the distal outer surface 88 of the substantially tube-shaped body 86
of the distal stem portion 66.

                                                   13
[0079] Referring to FIG. 5, the substantially tube-shaped body 86 further includes an inner
surface 92. The inner surface 92 is defined by an inner side surface 92a and an inner distal
surface 92b. The inner side surface 92a includes a substantially circular surface portion that is
connected to and extends axially away from the chamfered surface portion 76 c2B       of the
substantially circumferential rib portion of the inner distal surface 76c of the substantially tube
shaped body 68 of the proximal base portion 64. The inner distal surface 92b includes a
substantially flat surface portion extending perpendicularly from the inner side surface 92a.
[0080] The inner side surface 92 defines a passage 94 that extends through the substantially
tube-shaped body 86. In some instances, the passage 94 may extend between the chamfered
surface portion 76 c2B of the substantially circumferential rib portion of the inner distal surface
76c of the substantially tube-shaped body 68 of the proximal base portion 64 and the inner distal
surface 92b such that the passage 94 extends through approximately about 90% of a length         86L
of the substantially tube-shaped body 86. In some instances, passage 94 includes a substantially
constant diameter   9 2 aD defined by substantially circular surface portion 92a.
[0081] Access to the passage 94 is permitted by a proximal passage opening 96 and a distal
passage opening 98. The proximal passage opening 96 is substantially equal to and may be
defined by the diameter     84D formed by the chamfered surface portion 76 c2B of the substantially
circumferential rib portion of the inner distal surface 76c as described above. The proximal
passage opening 96 may be slightly greater than the substantially constant diameter      9 2 aD
defined by the substantially flat surface portion 92a of the inner side surface 92 of the
substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the distal stem portion 66.
[0082] Referring to FIGS. 6-7, the distal passage opening 98 is defined by a recess 100 formed
in the inner distal surface 92b of the inner side surface 92 of the substantially tube-shaped body
86 of the distal stem portion 66. Referring to FIG. 7, the recess 100 is defined by a plurality of
radial recess portions 100a, a central recess portion 100b and an axial recess passage portion
100c. The plurality of radial recess portions 100a radially converge upon and are fluidly
connected to the central recess portion 100b, and, the axial recess passage portion 100c is fluidly
connected to the central recess portion 100b. In some examples, the plurality of radial recess
portions 100a may include three radial recess portions that are angularly spaced apart by
approximately 120'.

                                                   14
[0083] With reference to FIG. 5, the passages 80, 94 and openings 82, 84, 96, 98 described
above permit the nozzle member 14 to guide movement of the fluid, F, through the nozzle
assembly 10. For example, the proximal passage opening 82 of the passage 80 formed by the
proximal base portion 64 permits fluid to enter the nozzle member 14. Once the fluid has
entered the nozzle member 14, the passage 80 formed by the proximal base portion 64 is in fluid
communication with the passage 94 formed by the distal stem portion 66, and, therefore, the
passages 80, 94 cooperate by guiding the fluid, F, as the fluid, F, travels through the nozzle
member 14 after entering the proximal passage opening 82 of the passage 80. Thereafter, the
distal passage opening 98 of the passage 94 formed by the distal stem portion 66 permits fluid to
exit the nozzle member 14.
[0084] Referring to FIGS. lA-1B and 8A-8D, an exemplary method for assembling the nozzle
assembly 10 is described. As seen in FIG. 8A, a first step for assembling the nozzle assembly
10 may include arranging the distal surface 56 of the head portion 54 of the distal portion 22 of
the fluid atomizer 12 opposite the proximal passage opening 82 of the nozzle member 14. Then,
as seen in FIG. 8B, the fluid atomizer 12 may be firstly axially inserted into the passage 80
formed by the proximal base portion 64 of the nozzle member 14 and then secondly axially
inserted into the passage 94 formed by the distal stem portion 66 of the nozzle member 14. In
some instances, the diameter   42D (see, e.g., FIGS. 2 and 3A) formed by side surface 48 of the
shoulder portion 42 of the fluid atomizer 12 may be approximately equal to but slightly less than
the substantially constant diameter  9 2 aD of the passage 94 formed by the distal stem portion 66
of the nozzle member 14; in some examples, upon inserting the fluid atomizer 12 into the
passage 94 formed by the distal stem portion 66 of the nozzle member 14, at least one surface
portion (e.g., one or more of the side surface 48 of the shoulder portion 42and the distal surface
56 of the head portion 54) of the fluid atomizer 12 may be disposed adjacent a surface (e.g., the
inner side surface 92 of the substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the distal stem portion 66) of
the nozzle member 14 for connecting the fluid atomizer 12 to the nozzle member 14 for forming
the nozzle assembly 10.
[0085] As seen in FIG. 8B, the conical cap member 16 may connected to and disposed about the
outer side surface 90 of the substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the distal stem portion 66 of
the nozzle member 14. The conical cap member 16 includes an axial passage 102 (see, e.g.,
FIG. 8A) that permits insertion of the distal stem portion 66 of the nozzle member 14 there
through when connecting the conical cap member 16 to the distal stem portion 66. In some

                                                   15
instances, one or more radially outwardly projecting barbs 104 may extend from the outer side
surface 90 of the substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the distal stem portion 66 of the nozzle
member 14 in order to bite into and radially secure the conical cap member 16 to the nozzle
member 14 once the distal stem portion 66 of the nozzle member 14 is arranged within the axial
passage 102 of the conical cap member 16. The conical cap member 16 may include a conical
shape in order to easily facilitate insertion of the nozzle assembly 10 into an orifice (e.g., a
nostril) of an animalia; if the nozzle assembly 10 is to be utilized for the purpose of delivering a
nasal drug, a nasal medicine, a nasal vaccination or the like, the conical cap member 16 may be
sized for insertion into a nostril of an animalia.
[0086] Although the conical cap member 16 is illustrated in a separated orientation with respect
to the nozzle member 14 in FIG. 8A, the conical cap member 16 may be connected to and
disposed about the outer side surface 90 of the substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the distal
stem portion 66 of the nozzle member 14 before insertion of the fluid atomizer 12 within the
passage 94 of the nozzle member 14. Further, it should be noted that the conical cap member 16
may be considered an optional component of the nozzle assembly 10, and, accordingly, some
implementations of the nozzle assembly 10 may include the fluid atomizer 12 and the nozzle
member 14.
[0087] Once the nozzle assembly 10 is assembled as described above at FIGS. 8A-8B, the
proximal passage opening 82 of the nozzle member 14 is arranged opposite a distal portion GD
(see, e.g., FIG. 8B) of the spray gun, G. In some instances, the distal portion GD of the spray
gun, G, includes an outer threaded surface GT. The outer threaded surface GT of the distal
portion GD of the spray gun, G, corresponds to the threaded inner side surface 76b of the
substantially tube-shaped body 68 of the nozzle member 14 in order to permit the nozzle
member 14 (and, thereby, the nozzle assembly 10) to be removably-connected to the spray gun,
G.
[0088] As seen in FIG. 8B, a non-threaded surface portion GN of the distal portion GD of the
spray gun, G, includes a diameter, D, that is slightly less than that of the substantially constant
diameter   9 2 aD of the passage 94 of the nozzle member 14. Accordingly, as seen in FIG. 8C, as
the threaded inner side surface 76b of the nozzle member 14 is threadingly-connected to the
outer threaded surface GT of the distal portion GD of the spray gun, G, a distal surface GDS of the
non-threaded surface portion GN of the of the distal portion GD of the spray gun, G, enters the

                                                  16
passage 94 and subsequently engages the proximal surface 26 of the substantially circular body
24 of the proximal portion 18 of the fluid atomizer 12. Engagement of the distal portion GD     Of
the spray gun, G, with the proximal surface 26 of the substantially circular body 24 of the
proximal portion 18 of the fluid atomizer 12 results in the distal portion GD of the spray gun, G,
axially pushing the fluid atomizer 12 through the passage 94 until the distal surface 56 of the
head portion 54 of the distal portion 22 of the fluid atomizer 12 engages the inner distal surface
92b of the substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the distal stem portion 66 nozzle member 14.
Additionally, as seen in FIGS. 8C-8D, once the nozzle member 14 is fully threadingly
connected to the spray gun, G, the chamfered surface portion 76 c2B of the substantially
circumferential rib portion of the inner surface 76 of the nozzle member 14 axially engages a
rounded surface portion of the distal portion GD of the spray gun, G, thereby sealing the passage
94 that extends through the substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the nozzle member 14 from the
passage 80 that extends through the substantially tube-shaped body 68; as a result of the seal
described above, residual fluid, F, is not permitted to leak from the passage 94 and into the
passage 80 after actuation of the spray gun, G.
[0089] As seen in FIG. 8B', prior to the distal surface 56 of the fluid atomizer 12 being axially
urged toward the inner distal surface 92b of the nozzle member 14 by the spray gun, G, the
intermediate knee portion 40 of each leg member 34a, 34b of the pair of opposing legs 34 does
not engage the inner side surface 92a of the substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the distal stem
portion 66 of the nozzle member 14 such that a gap or spacing, S, is located between the
intermediate knee portion 40 of each leg member 34a, 34b of the pair of opposing legs 34 and
the inner side surface 92a of the substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the distal stem portion 66
of the nozzle member 14. As seen in FIG. 8C', upon initial engagement of the distal surface 56
of the fluid atomizer 12 with the inner distal surface 92b of the nozzle member 14 as described
above in FIG. 8C, the intermediate knee portion 40 of each leg member 34a, 34b of the pair of
opposing legs 34 still does not engage the inner side surface 92a of the substantially tube-shaped
body 86 of the distal stem portion 66 of the nozzle member 14 such the gap or spacing, S, still
remains between the intermediate knee portion 40 of each leg member 34a, 34b of the pair of
opposing legs 34 and the inner side surface 92a of the substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the
distal stem portion 66 of the nozzle member 14.
[0090] As seen in FIG. 8D', after engagement of the distal surface 56 of the fluid atomizer 12
with the inner distal surface 92b of the nozzle member 14, any further axially-directed force

                                                   17
imparted to the fluid atomizer 12 by the spray gun, G (caused as a result of further rotation of
the nozzle member 14 relative the distal portion GD of the spray gun, G, by way of the threaded
coupling described above), may cause the fluid atomizer 12 to be subtly compressed between
the distal surface GDS of the non-threaded surface portion GN of the of the distal portion GD   Of
the spray gun, G, and the inner distal surface 92b of the nozzle member 14. As a result of the
compression of the fluid atomizer 12 as described above, the pair of opposing legs 34 of the
fluid atomizer 12 flexes radially outwardly, R (as seen in FIG. 8D' comparatively with respect
to FIGS. 8B' and 8C'), such that the intermediate knee portion 40 of each leg member 34a, 34b
of the pair of opposing legs 34 engages the inner side surface 92a of the substantially tube
shaped body 86 of the distal stem portion 66 nozzle member 14 that defines the passage 94. As
a result of the engagement of the intermediate knee portion 40 of each leg member 34a, 34b of
the pair of opposing legs 34 engaging the inner side surface 92a of the substantially tube-shaped
body 86 of the distal stem portion 66 nozzle member 14, any spinning movement of the fluid
atomizer 12 about the central axis, A-A, relative the nozzle member 14 is prohibited when a
fluid is guided from the container, C, through the spray gun, G, and out of the nozzle assembly
10.
[0091] With reference to FIGS. 9 and 9A-9D, once the nozzle assembly 10 is connected to the
spray gun, G, as described above, fluid, F, is guided from the container, C, through the spray
gun, G, and out of the nozzle assembly 10 according to the following exemplary embodiment.
Firstly, as seen in FIG. 9A, after actuating the spray gun, G (e.g., by, for example, pressing a
handle member, GH (see, e.g., FIGS. 1A-1B) of the spray gun, G), fluid, F, may be guided from
the container, C, such that the fluid, F, enters a passage Gp formed in the distal portion GD of the
spray gun, G. As described above, the passage Gp formed in the distal portion GD of the spray
gun, G, extends through the passage 80 that extends through the substantially tube-shaped body
68 of the nozzle member 14; therefore, as the fluid, F, travels through the passage Gp formed in
the distal portion GD of the spray gun, G, the fluid, F, is also travelling through the passage 80
that extends through the substantially tube-shaped body 68 of the nozzle member 14.
[0092] Then, as seen in FIG. 9B, the fluid, F, may exit the passage Gp at the distal surface GDS
of the non-threaded surface portion GN of the distal portion GD of the spray gun, G. The passage
Gp may terminate at the distal surface GDS of the non-threaded surface portion GN of the of the
distal portion GD of the spray gun, G, and may be axially aligned with the passage 32 that
extends through the substantially circular body 24 of the proximal portion of the fluid atomizer

                                                   18
12 such that the fluid, F, may travel beyond the distal surface GDS of the non-threaded surface
portion GN of the of the distal portion GD of the spray gun, G, and through the passage 32 that
extends through the substantially circular body 24 of the proximal portion of the fluid atomizer
12. After the fluid, F, travels through the passage 32 that extends through the substantially
circular body 24 of the proximal portion of the fluid atomizer 12, the fluid, F, may axially flow
through the passage 94 that extends through the substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the distal
stem portion 66 nozzle member 14 and about the pair of opposing legs 34 of the intermediate
portion 20 fluid atomizer 12 and toward the proximal surface 44 of the distal portion 22 of the
fluid atomizer 12.
[0093] Referring to FIG. 9C, the fluid, F, then axially travels toward the proximal surface 44 of
the distal portion 22, the fluid atomizer 12 and is axially channeled toward the radially inwardly
projecting recess 50 formed in the side surface 48 of the shoulder portion 42 of the fluid
atomizer 12 as a result of the side surface 48 of the shoulder portion 42 of the distal portion 22
of the fluid atomizer 12 being disposed adjacent or close to the inner side surface 92a of the
substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the of the distal stem portion 66 nozzle member 14.
Accordingly, the fluid, F, may be guided axially along the radially inwardly projecting recess 50
formed in the side surface 48 of the shoulder portion 42 toward the head portion 54 of the distal
portion 22 of the fluid atomizer 12 such that the fluid, F, is permitted to further axially flow
through the passage 94 that extends through the substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the distal
stem portion 66 nozzle member 14.
[0094] Referring to FIG. 9D, after the fluid, F, travels through the radially inwardly projecting
recess 50 formed in the side surface 48 of the shoulder portion 42of the fluid atomizer 12, the
fluid, F, may axially flow through the passage 94 that extends through the substantially tube
shaped body 86 of the distal stem portion 66 nozzle member 14 and about the side surface 58 of
the head portion 54 of the distal portion 22 of the fluid atomizer 12 and toward the distal surface
56 of the head portion 54 of the distal portion 22 of the fluid atomizer 12. Because one of the
arcuate surfaces 63a-63c (e.g., the arcuate surface 63a) of the plurality of arcuate surfaces 63 of
the head portion 54 is aligned with the radially inwardly projecting recess 50 of the shoulder
portion 42, the fluid, F, that is axially guided along the arcuate surface 63a is radially diverted
around the head portion 54 as the fluid further axially flows through the passage 94 that extends
through the substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the distal stem portion 66 nozzle member 14.

                                                    19
[0095] As the fluid, F, is radially diverted around the head portion 54 as described above, the
fluid, F, is axially channeled toward each radially inwardly projecting recess 60a, 60b, 60c of
the plurality of radially inwardly projecting recesses 60 of the head portion 54 and toward the
distal surface 56 of the head portion 54. Once the fluid, F, flows through the passage 94 that
extends through the substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the distal stem portion 66 nozzle
member 14 such that the fluid, F, arrives at the distal surface 56 of the head portion 54, the fluid,
F, is guided out of the passage 94 upon entering the recess 100 formed in the inner distal surface
92b of the inner side surface 92 of the substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the distal stem
portion 66.
[0096] Once the fluid, F, enters the recess 100 formed in the inner distal surface 92b of the inner
side surface 92 of the substantially tube-shaped body 86 of the distal stem portion 66, the fluid,
F, firstly enters the plurality of radial recess portions 100a of the recess 100 such that the fluid,
F, is radially guided toward the central axis, A-A. The fluid, F, that is radially guided by the
plurality of radial recess portions 100a of the recess 100 collides at the central recess portion
100b of the recess 100 and then subsequently exits the nozzle member 14 at the axial recess
passage portion 100c. As a result of the arrangement of the fluid atomizer 12 within the nozzle
member 14, and, as a result of the collision of the fluid, F, arising from the arrangement of the
plurality of radial recess portions 100a, the fluid, F, exits the nozzle member 14 with an
atomized, swirling spray pattern.
[0097] After one or more uses of the spray gun, G, as described above, one or more of the
passages 80, 94 and openings 82, 84, 96, 98 may be clogged (with, e.g., mucus, if, for example,
the nozzle assembly 10 is arranged within the nasal passage of animalia). Therefore, a user may
disconnect the nozzle assembly 10 from the spray gun, G, by threadingly decoupling the nozzle
assembly 10 from the spray gun, G. When the nozzle assembly 10 is decoupled from the spray
gun, G, the pair of opposing legs 34 of the fluid atomizer 12 may no longer be flexed in the
radially outwardly direction (as seen in FIG. 8D') and return to a relaxed, non-flexed orientation
(as seen in FIGS. 8B' and 8C'); as a result, the fluid atomizer 12 may slide out of the passages
80, 94 of the nozzle member 14.
[0098] Once the fluid atomizer 12 has been disconnected from the nozzle member 14, the fluid
atomizer 12 may be cleaned. Further, once the fluid atomizer 12 has been disconnected from

                                                 20
the nozzle member 14, unobstructed access to one or more the passages 80, 94 and openings 82,
84, 96, 98 may be provided in order to facilitate cleaning of the nozzle member 14.
[0099] A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood
that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the
disclosure. Accordingly, other implementations are within the scope of the following claims.
For example, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still
achieve desirable results.
