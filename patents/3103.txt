   Provisional Application number 61/388,028, filed September 30, 2010,
 5 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
   Background
   [0002]            This invention relates to suture anchors for attaching
   suture to bone, and more specifically to such suture anchors which
10 employ a suture management feature.
   [00031           It is known to use suture anchors for attaching soft
   tissues such as ligaments or tendons to adjacent bone. Threaded suture
   anchors employ external threads and are rotated into the bone, usually
15 into a pre-drilled bone hole, to affix the suture anchor to the bone. They
   will typically employ an eyelet or other feature for affixing one or more
   sutures to the anchor. Managing the sutures extending from the suture
   anchor can be a challenge.
20 Summary of the Invention
           A suture anchor according to the present invention comprises an anchor
   body having a longitudinal axis and bone engaging external threads oriented for
   rotation about the longitudinal axis. A suture attachment on the anchor body is
   rotational with respect to the body about the longitudinal axis whereby to help
25 reduce twisting of one or more sutures which may be attached to the suture
   attachment as the anchor body is threaded into a bone.
           Preferably, the body and suture attachment are provided sterile and
   packaged in a bacteria proof enclosure. One or more sutures can be attached to
30 the suture attachment.
                                                                               2638545vl

                                               2
           Preferably, a loop of suture is affixed to the suture attachment, the loop
   having ends extending outwardly from the suture anchor body and suture
   attachment. Also preferably, a plurality of suture loops of suture are affixed to the
 5 suture attachment, each loop having ends extending outwardly from the suture
   anchor body and suture attachment.
           Preferably, an axial bore enters the body from a proximal end thereof with
   the suture attachment located on the body such that one or more sutures attached
10 thereto can extend out of the axial bore at the body proximal end. Preferably, the
   body comprises a first abutment surface within the axial bore and the suture
   attachment comprises an opposing second abutment surface engaged with the first
   abutment surface such that the suture attachment is rotatable in the axial bore
   against the first abutment surface with the engagement between the first abutment
15 surface and the second abutment surface preventing the suture attachment from
   moving proximally out of the axial bore. Preferably, the first abutment surface
   and second abutment surface are annular.
           In one aspect of the invention, the suture attachment comprises a disc
20 having a plurality of axial holes therethrough for receiving one or more loops of
   suture therethrough.
           In one aspect of the invention, the suture attachment comprises a proximal
   cylindrical portion having one or more radially extending bosses thereon, the
25 cylindrical portion being received within the axial bore with the one or more
   bosses adjacent a wall of the anchor body forming the axial bore such that suture
   looped about the one or more bosses is retained by the one or more bosses within
   the body between the wall and cylindrical portion.
30         A method according to the present invention provides for attaching tissue
   to a bone. The method comprises the steps of: passing a first portion of a suture
                                                                                  2638545vl

 5 body rotational with respect to the body about the longitudinal axis with the
   second portion of the suture length attached to the suture attachment; and rotating
   the suture attachment with respect to the anchor body to reduce twisting of the
   suture length induced by the step of threading the suture anchor body into the
   bone hole.
10
           Preferably, the second suture portion comprises a loop of suture affixed to
   the suture attachment and a pair of suture segments extending therefrom and the
   step of rotating the suture attachment reduces twisting of the pair of suture
   segment with respect to each other.

 5 Detailed Description
   [0004]          FIG. 1 illustrates a suture anchor 10 according to the
   present invention. Suture anchor 10 comprises a distal body portion 12
   which connects to a proximal body portion 14 both of which are held
   together by a pin 16 through respective cross-bores 18 and 20 in the
10 distal body portion 12 and the proximal body portion 14. The distal
   body portion 12 is generally cylindrical in shape having a proximal end
   22 through which the cross-bore 18 passes and a distal end 24 which
   tapers inwardly for easier insertion of the suture anchor 10 into a bone
   hole (not shown in FIG. 1). An external screw thread 26 encircles the
15 distal body portion 12.
   [0005]          The proximal body portion 14 is also generally
   cylindrical in shape and bears an external screw thread 28 which mates
   with the thread 26 to form a continuous threading about the suture
20 anchor 10. An axial-bore 30 passes through the proximal body portion
   14. A distal portion 32 thereof, has a larger diameter than a proximal
   portion 34 thereby creating an internal annual abutment 36. The
   proximal portion 34 has a hexagonal cross-section to accommodate a
   driving tool (not shown in FIG. 1). One with ordinary skill in the art
25 would appreciate that alternative tool/anchor engagements may be
   employed.
   [00061          The bore-distal portion 32 has a circular cross section
   and is sized to closely accommodate the body distal portion proximal
30 end 22. A suture receiver 38 fits within the axial-bore distal portion 32
   between the abutment 36 and the distal body portion proximal end 22.
                                                                             2638545vl

                                               5
   It has a circular cross-section and is sized to rotate freely about a
   longitudinal axis 40 of the suture anchor 10. Six axial suture bores
   42A-F pass through the suture receiver 38.
 5 [00071           Turning also now to FIG. 2, the suture bores 42A-F
   accommodates three suture loops 44A-C. Alternatively, as shown in
   FIG. 3, a suture strand 46 can be woven through the suture bores 42A-F
   such that the suture loops 44A-C can be threaded through portions of the
   suture strand 46 extending above the suture receiver 38. Ends 48 of the
10 each of the suture loops 44A-C extend proximally out of the suture
   anchor 10 through the axial bore 30. The suture ends 48 can then be
   attached to soft tissue as is understood by one of skill in the art for
   attaching that soft tissue to a bone. For instance, in a rotator cuff repair,
   each of the suture loops 44A-C may extend through the rotator cuff
15 tendon at different locations to effect a repair.
   [00081           The design of the suture anchor 10 provides advantages both in
   manufacturability and in performance. Having the suture loops 44A-C attach
   internal of the suture anchor and extending out through the axial bore 30, provides
20 a preferred angle of exit toward soft tissue versus a proximal attachment point.
   With the separate distal body portion 12 and proximal body portion 14 attaching
   the suture loops 44A-C deep within the suture anchor 10 becomes easier during
   manufacturing. When inserting a conventional threaded anchor, any suture loops
   extending therefrom tend to twist due to the twisting of the anchor in its insertion.
25  The present suture receiver 38 is free to rotate within the axial bore 30 thus
   reducing twisting of the suture loops 44A-C as the suture anchor 10 is inserted.
   [0009]           Turning also now to FIG. 4, preferably, the suture anchor 10 is
   inserted into a bone 50 having a pre-drilled hole 52. A driver 54 having an
30 elongated body 56 and an external hex shape at its distal tip 58, mates with the
   hex shaped axial bore proximal portion 34. The suture loops 44A-C extend
                                                                                 2638545vl

                                                6
   proximally out of the suture anchor 10 through a canulation 60 through the driver
   distal tip 58 and body 56. In one preferred embodiment, the canulation 60 is open
   62 along one side much that after the suture anchor is driven into the bone hole 52
   by the driver 54, the driver 54 can be removed from the suture anchor 10 with the
 5 suture loops 44A-C disengaging from the driver 54 through the canulation
   opening 62.
   [0010]           FIG. 5 illustrates and alternative embodiment of a suture anchor 70
   comprising a distal threaded body portion 72 and proximal threaded body portion
10 74. The suture anchor 70 is similar in most respects to the suture anchor 10.
   However, the proximal body portion 74 carries an additional thread start 76 at its
   proximal portion 78 thereby effectively increasing thread pitch at the proximal
   portion 78 and thus enhancing purchase within the hard cortical bone (not shown
   in FIG. 5) with which this portion typically engages. Also, the anchor 70 employs
15 a somewhat different suture receiver 80.
   [0011]           The suture receiver 80 comprises a central cylindrical body 82
   having a proximally extending suture eyelet 84. A distally extending post 86
   terminates in an annular flange 88. The anchor distal body portion 72 has an axial
20 bore 90 having a distal body portion 92 sized to accommodate the flange 88 and a
   narrower proximal portion 94 sized to accommodate the post 86 with the diameter
   differences creating an internal annular abutment 96 against which the flange 88
   bears preventing its proximal movement out of the bore 90. A lateral cut out 98 is
   provided in the distal body portion 72 to allow the flange 88 and post 86 to be
25 inserted laterally into distal bore 90. This arrangement allows the suture receiver
   80 to rotate freely within the distal bore (90).
   [0012]           Several bosses 98 extend outwardly radially from the suture
   receiver body 82 and fit closely, yet with rotation, within an axial bore 100 in the
30 proximal body portion 74. Suture loops (not shown in FIG.5) can be passed
   through the eyelet 84 and also, if desired, around each of the bosses 98, and then
   proximally out of the anchor through the bore 100, the loops about the bosses
                                                                                 2638545vl

                                               7
   being held by the bosses 98 and not being able to slip between the bosses 98 and
   the body 74 due to the close fit of the bosses 98 within the bore 100.
   [00131          FIG. 6 illustrates a further embodiment of a suture anchor 110
 5 similar to that shown in FIG. 5. A suture receiver 112 is rotatably received within
   a distal body portion 114 as in the previous embodiment however its proximal end
   116 is structured differently. It is cylindrical and bears three suture eyelets 118 A
   C which are spaced apart both axially and rotationally, with the middle eyelet 118
   B passing laterally through the proximal end 116 at 45 degrees with respect to the
10 top eyelet 118 A and bottom eyelet 118 C and with the top and bottom eyelets 118
   A and 118 C passing laterally through the proximal end and being oriented normal
   to each other. The placement and orientation of the eyelets 118 A-C assists in
   suture management, both in separation and in identification of individual loops.
15 [0014]          FIGS. 7 A-C. illustrate a further suture anchor 120 having an
   alternative suture receiver 122 in the form of a bent loop 124 of spring metal
   having proximally extending ends 126. It is received within an axial bore 128 of a
   distal body portion 130 of the anchor 120 (which attaches to a proximal body
   portion 131). One or more lengths of suture (not shown in FIGS. 7 A-C) can
20 attach to the loop 124. Proximal force therefrom draws the ends 126 up along a
   camming ledge 132 within the bore 128 toward angled side ports 134 from the
   bore 128 through the distal body portion 130, allowing the ends 126 to protrude
   from the distal body portion 130 (see FIG. 7 C) and provide additional fixation
   within a bone (not shown in FIGS. 7 A-C). While the anchor 120 is being
25 inserted a distal end 136 of a cannulated insertion tool 138 keep the ends 126
   within the bore 128 and distal of the ports 134 while allowing rotation of the
   suture receiver 122 within the bore 128.
