A system and method for detecting screen-out using a fracturing valve for mitigation is disclosed
herein. The fracture method can comprise fracturing a well using a fracturing valve, while a
downhole pressure is less than a predetermined threshold.        The method can also comprise

                    Mitigation
Inventors           Kristian Brekke
                                        BACKGROUND
[0001] Mere reference to background art herein should not be construed as an admission that
such art constitutes common general knowledge in relation to the invention.        This disclosure
relates to a system and method for detecting screen-out using a fracturing valve for mitigation.
[0002] Over the years, hydraulic fracturing with multiple fractures has been a popular method in
producing gas and oil from a horizontal wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves injecting a highly
pressurized fracturing fluid through a wellbore, which causes rock layers to fracture.        Once
cracks are formed, proppants are introduced to the injected fluid to prevent fractures from
closing.    The proppants use particulates, such as grains of sands or ceramics, which are
permeable enough to allow formation fluid to flow to the channels or wells.
[0003] However, during a fracturing operation, major problems, such as screen-outs, can occur.
Screen-outs happen when a continued injection of fluid into the fracture requires pressure
beyond the safe limitations of the wellbore and surface equipment. This condition takes place
due to high fluid leakage, excessive concentration of proppants, and an insufficient pad size that
                                               -1-

blocks the flow of proppants. As a result, pressure rapidly builds up. Screen-out can disrupt a
fracturing operation and require cleaning of the wellbore before resuming operations. A delay in
one fracturing operation can cause disruption on the completion and production of subsequent
fractures.
[0004] The consequences of screen-out can depend on the type of completion used in fracturing.
One of the common completions used for horizontal well is open hole liner completion. This
involves running the casing directly into the formation so that no casing or liner is placed across
the production zone. This method for fracturing can be quick and inexpensive. Open hole liner
completion can also include the use of a ball-actuated sliding sleeve system, commonly used for
multistage fracturing. However, if screen-out occurs near the toe of a horizontal wellbore, the
small openings of the ball seats can make it difficult to use a coiled tubing or a workover string
to wash the proppants out. One initial solution can include opening the well and waiting for the
fracturing fluid to flow back. However, if the flow back does not occur, the only solution left is
to mill out the completion and apply a different completion scheme to the wellbore. As a result,
the entire operation can cause delays and higher expenses.
[0005] Another known completion method is a plug-and-perforate system, which is closely
similar to the open hole liner system. This method involves cementing the liner of the horizontal
wellbore and is often performed at a given horizontal location near the toe of the well. The plug
and perforate method involves the repetitive process of perforating multiple clusters in different
treatment intervals, pulling them out of a hole, pumping a high rate stimulation treatment, and
                                               -2-

setting a plug to isolate the interval, until all intervals are stimulated. The consequences of
screen-out in this method may not be as severe compared to the ball-actuated sliding sleeve
system, since the well can be accessed with coiled tubing to wash the proppants out.
[0006] Yet, another method used has included cemented liner completions with restricted entry.
Cemented liner completions with restricted entry involve controlling fluid entry into a wellbore.
This method provides a cemented liner or casing comprising a cluster of limited openings that
can allow fluid communication between a region of a wellbore and the formation. However, a
poor connection between the well and the formation often results in screen-out. Thus, screen out
encountered in each completion method adds costs and causes disruption in fracturing operations
and production.
[0007] As such, it would be useful to have an improved system and method for detecting screen
out using a fracturing valve for mitigation.
                                            SUMMARY
[0008] This disclosure relates to a system and method for detecting screen-out using a fracturing
valve for mitigation.   The fracture method can comprise fracturing a well using a fracturing
valve, while a downhole pressure is less than a predetermined threshold. The method can also
comprise actuating by automated process the fracturing valve from a fracturing position to a non
fracturing position upon detecting by a pressure sensor in the wellbore that the downhole
pressure has reached said predetermined threshold.

[0009] The fracturing valve system may comprise a base pipe comprising an insert port capable
of housing a stop ball, as the stop ball may be insertable partially within the chamber of the base
pipe. Additionally, the system may comprise a sliding sleeve comprising a first sleeve with an
inner surface having an angular void and a large void. The first sleeve may be maneuverable
into multiple positions,     In a first position, an angular void may rest over the insert port,
preventing the stop ball from exiting the chamber of the base pipe. In a second position, where
the large void rests over the insert port, the stop ball may be capable of exiting the chamber of
the base pipe to enter the large void.
[0010] Additionally, a method of detecting screen out using a fracturing valve is disclosed.
Specifically, the method can comprise injecting a fracturing fluid into said fracturing valve,
which comprises a base pipe and a sliding sleeve. The base pipe can comprise one or more insert
ports each capable of housing a stop ball. The sliding sleeve can comprise an inner surface with
an angular void and a large void, as the sliding sleeve initially in a first position, where the
angular void rests over said insert port. The method can further comprise applying a first force
on the frac ball by the fracturing fluid, applying a second force on one or more stop balls by the
frac ball, and applying a third force against the angular void by the stop balls. Furthermore, the
method can comprise biasing the sliding sleeve, at least in part by a third force, toward a second
position, where a large void rests over the insert port. Thus, the stop ball can be capable of
exiting the chamber of the base pipe to enter the large void.

                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0031] Described herein is a system and method for detecting screen-out using a fracturing valve
for mitigation. The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to
make and use the invention as claimed and is provided in the context of the particular examples
discussed below, variations of which will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. In the
interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification.
It will be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation (as in any
development project), design decisions must be made to achieve the designers' specific goals
(e.g., compliance with system- and business-related constraints), and that these goals will vary
from one implementation to another. It will also be appreciated that such development effort
                                                   -6-

might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for
those of ordinary skill in the field of the appropriate art having the benefit of this disclosure.
Accordingly, the claims appended hereto are not intended to be limited by the disclosed
embodiments, but are to be accorded their widest scope consistent with the principles and
features disclosed herein.
[0032] Figure 1A illustrates a side view of a base pipe 100. Base pipe 100 can be connected as a
portion of a pipe string. In one embodiment, base pipe 100 can comprise cylindrical material
with different wall openings and/or slots. Base pipe 100 wall openings can comprise an insert
port 101, a fracturing port 102, and/or a production port 103. Insert port 101 can be made of one
or more small openings in a base pipe 100. Fracturing port 102 can also comprise one or more
openings. Furthermore, production port 103 can be a plurality of openings in base pipe 100.
[0033] Figure 1B illustrates a front view of base pipe 100. Base pipe 100 can further comprise a
chamber 104. Chamber 104 can be a cylindrical opening or a space created inside base pipe 100.
Chamber 104 can allow material, such as fracturing fluid or hydrocarbons, to pass through.
Figure IC illustrates a cross-sectional view of a base pipe 100. Each wall opening discussed
above can be circularly placed around base pipe 100.
[0034] Figure 2A illustrates a sliding sleeve 200. Sliding sleeve 200 can be connected to a fixed
sleeve 205 by an actuator 206, while sliding sleeve 200 can be in line with an outer ring 207. In
one embodiment, sliding sleeve 200 can be a cylindrical tube that can comprise fracturing port
                                               -7-

102. Thus, fracturing port can have a first portion within base pipe 100 and a second portion
within sliding sleeve 200.
[0035] Figure 2B illustrates a front view of a sliding sleeve 200. Sliding sleeve 200 can further
comprise an outer chamber 201.        In one embodiment, outer chamber 201 can be an opening
larger than chamber 104. As such, chamber 201 can be large enough to house base pipe 100.
[0036] Figure 2C illustrates a cross-sectional view of a sliding sleeve 200. Sliding sleeve 200
can comprise a first sleeve 202 and a second sleeve 203. First sleeve 202 and second sleeve 203
can be attached through one or more curved sheets 204, as the spaces between each curved sheet
204 can define a portion of fracturing port 102. Inner surface of first sleeve 202 can have void
208 comprising an angular void 208a within the inner surface created by a gradually thinning
wall of first sleeve 202, and a large void 208b. In one embodiment, void 208 can extend radially
around the complete inner diameter of base pipe 100, partially around inner diameter. In another
embodiment, voids 208 can exist only at discrete positions around the inner radius of first sleeve
202. If completely around inner diameter, the ends of inner surface can have a smaller diameter
than the void 208. Angular voids 208a can each be above insert port 101 when sliding sleeve is
in fracturing mode.
[0037] Figure 2D illustrates a cross sectional view of a sliding sleeve 200 that further comprises
a fixed sleeve 205, and an actuator 206. In one embodiment, actuator 206, can be a biasing
device. In such embodiment, biasing device can be a spring. In another embodiment, actuator
can be bidirectional and/or motorized. In one embodiment, second sleeve 203 of sliding sleeve
                                                -8-

200 can be attached to fixed sleeve 205 using actuator 206. In one embodiment, sliding sleeve
200 can be pulled towards fixed sleeve 205, thus compressing load actuator 206 with potential
energy. Later, actuator 206 can be released, or otherwise instigated, by pushing sliding sleeve
200 away from fixed sleeve 205.
[0038] Figure 3A illustrates a peripheral view of outer ring 207. Figure 3B illustrates a front
view of an outer ring 207. In one embodiment, outer ring 207 can be a solid cylindrical tube
forming a ring chamber 301, as seen in figure 3B. In one embodiment, outer ring 207 can be an
enclosed solid material forming a cylindrical shape. Ring chamber 301 can be the space formed
inside outer ring 207. Furthermore, ring chamber 301 can be large enough to slide over base
pipe 100.
[0039] Figure 4A illustrates a valve casing 400. In one embodiment, valve casing 400 can be a
cylindrical material, which can comprise fracturing port 102, and production port 103. Figure
4B illustrates a fracturing port of a valve casing. In one embodiment, fracturing port 102 can be
a plurality of openings circularly placed around valve casing 400, as seen in Figure 4B. Figure
4C illustrates a production slot of a valve casing. Furthermore, production port 103 can be one
or more openings placed around valve casing 400, as seen in Figure 4C.
[0040] Figure 5 illustrates a fracturing valve 500 in fracturing mode.      In one embodiment,
fracturing valve 500 can comprise base pipe 100, sliding sleeve 200, outer ring 207, and/or valve
casing 400. In such embodiment, base pipe 100 can be an innermost layer of fracturing valve
500. A middle layer around base pipe 100 can comprise outer ring 207 fixed to base pipe 100
                                                 -9-

and sliding sleeve 200, in which fixed sleeve 205 is fixed to base pipe 100. Fracturing valve 500
can comprise valve casing 400 as an outer later. Valve casing 400 can, in one embodiment,
connect to outer ring 207 and fixed sleeve 205. In a fracturing position, fracturing port 102 can
be aligned and open, due to the relative position of base pipe 100 and sliding sleeve 200.
[0041] Fracturing valve 500 can further comprise a frac ball 501 and one or more stop balls 502.
For purposes of this disclosure, stop ball 501 can be any shaped object capable of residing in
fracturing valve 500 that can substantially prevent frac ball 501 from passing. Further frac ball
501 can be any shaped object capable of navigating at least a portion of base pipe 100 and, while
being held in place by stop balls 502, restricting flow.    In one embodiment, stop ball 502 can
rest in insert port 101. At a fracturing state, actuator 206 can be in a closed state, pushing stop
ball 502 partially into chamber 104. In such state, frac ball 501 can be released from the surface
and down the well. Frac ball 501 can be halted at insert port 101 by any protruding stop balls
502, while fracturing valve 500 is in a fracturing mode. As such, the protruding portion of stop
ball 502 can halt frac ball 501. In this state, fracturing port 102 will be open, allowing flow of
proppants from chamber 104 through fracturing port 102 and into a formation which allows
fracturing to take place.
[0042] Figure 6A illustrates an embodiment of an impedance device.          Impedance device can
counteract actuator 206, in an embodiment where actuator 206 is a biasing device, such as
spring. In one embodiment, an erosion device in the form of a string 601 can be an impedance
device.   In such embodiment, string 601 can be made of material that can break, erode, or
                                                - 10 -

dissolve, for example, when it is exposed to a strong force, or eroding or corrosive substance. A
string holder 602 can be a material, such as a hook or an eye, attached onto sliding sleeve 200
and base pipe 100. String 601 can connect sliding sleeve 200 with base pipe 100 through string
holder 602. While intact, string can prevent actuator 206 from releasing. Once the string is
broken, broken, actuator 206 can push sliding sleeve 601. One method of breaking string 601
can comprise pushing a corrosive material reactive with string through fracturing port,
deteriorating string 601 until actuator 206 can overcome its impedance.
[0043] Figure 6B illustrates another embodiment of an impedance device. In such embodiment,
string 601 can comprise a first segment 601a and a second segment 601b. String holder 602 can
connect first segment 601a with base pipe 100, while second segment 601b can attach to string
holder 602 that connects with sliding sleeve 200. In such embodiment, any axial force applied,
to sliding sleeve can put a tensile force on the impedance device. First segment 601 a can be
made of material that can be immune to a corrosive or eroding substance, but designed to fail at a
particular tensile force, while second segment 601b can be made of material reactive to corrosive
or erodable substance, that will fail at an increasingly lower tensile force. Such failure force
gradient of second segment can be initially be higher than a failure force related to first segment
601 a, but eventually decrease below it over time. As such, first segment 601 a can be a portion of
impedance device that can break when exposed to failure force, regardless of the extent to which
second segment 601b has been dissolved.
                                               - 11 -

[0044] Figure 7 illustrates fracturing valve 500 in production mode. As sliding sleeve 200 is
pushed towards outer ring 207 by actuator 206, fracturing port 102 can close, and production
port 103 can open. Concurrently, second force by frac ball 501 can push stop balls 502 back into
the inner end of first sleeve 202, which can further allow frac ball 501 to slide through base pipe
100 to another fracturing valve 500. Once production port 103 is opened, extraction of oil and
gas can start. In one embodiment, production ports can have a check valve to allow fracturing to
continue downstream without pushing fracturing fluid through the production port.
[0045] Figure 8A illustrates a graph 800 showing a breakage point 801 of string 601.              As
mentioned in the discussion of figure 6A, string 601 can be made to dissolve over the course of
the fracturing. In graph 800, x-axis can signify time, while y-axis can signify force. Graph 800
displays a line graph for a string strength line 802 and a string tensile force line 803.     String
strength line 802 can represent force required to break string 601 over time. String strength line
802 can be a straight line that starts high but decreases over time. The string strength line 802
indicates that string 601 can slowly dissolve or erode, as it gets thinner from the injected
corrosive material in fracturing valve 500. Thus, the amount of force required to break string
601 can decrease over time. String tensile force line 803 can be the tensile force on string 601.
The tensile force can be the force of the actuator 206 and the axial force of stop balls 501 related
to the pressure of the well. When in fracturing state, a highly pressurized fracturing fluid can be
injected into the fracturing port 102 and into a formation.     Once the formation fractures, the
pressure on frac ball 501 can level or drop off. Thus, more fracturing fluid can be injected into
the formation with little change in pressure. After a period of time, the formation can fill up and
                                               - 12 -

no longer take fracturing fluid. At that point, pressure begins increasing again as more fluid is
pushed into wellbore. The changes in pressure in the wellbore directly affect the tension on the
line, as shown in string tensile force line 803. The point where string strength line 802 and string
tensile force line 803 meet is a breakage point 801 for string 601.
[0046] To prevent screen-out, in one embodiment, a pressure sensor can be placed down well.
Pressure sensor can be capable of reading pressure or determining when pressure reaches a
threshold. Once threshold point is reached, pressure sensor can send signal to a computer, which
can control sliding sleeve 200 by actuator 206. As a result, computer can cause sliding sleeve
200 to actuate as a result of commands to actuator 206. In one embodiment, actuator 206 can
comprise a motor, which can generate the necessary force to move sliding sleeve 200 from a
fracturing position to a production position.
[0047] Figure 8B illustrates a close up view of fracturing valve 500 in fracturing mode.
Wellbore pressure will push frac ball 501 down into chamber 104 by a first force 804. As frac
ball 501 rests against stop ball 502, the pressure on frac ball 501 can cause stop ball 502 to push
towards sliding sleeve 200.      Frac ball 501 can push stop ball 502 with a second force 805,
causing stop ball 502 to go into the angular inner wall of sliding sleeve 202. A third force 806 of
stop ball 502 can build up against the wall of angular void 208a. The result is a radial force 808
in the radial direction of sliding sleeve 202, and an axial force 807 in an axial direction of base
pipe 100, toward outer ring 207.       The force in either direction depends on the angle of the
angular void 208. A greater angle produces more force in the axial direction.
                                                 - 13 -

[0048] As the force on actuator 206 and the axial force 807 that ultimately results from the
pressure on frac ball 501 is building, the axial force needed to break string 601 decreases due to
string deterioration. As such, the point where string strength line 802 and string tensile force line
803 cross is breakage point 801. At breakage point 801, string 601 finally gives in to the tensile
force and breaks.
[0049] Figure 8C illustrates a graph 804 showing breakage point 801 for a segmented
embodiment of string 601. As discussed in figure 6B, string 601 can break at a required force or
through exposure to corrosive substance. In graph 804, string strength line 802 can start with a
flat horizontal line that eventually or gradually decreases over time. First segment 601a can be
represented with the flat string strength line 802 that shows first segment 601a is breakable when
a certain amount of force is applied. A decrease in strength of string 601 in strength line 802
can relate to    second segment 601b of string 601 dissolving to a point where it eventually
becomes weaker than first segment.        When in fracturing mode, the increase and decrease in
pressure can also affect the tension on string 601. As such, breakage point 801 is where string
strength line 802 and string tensile force line 803 meets.
[0050] Figure 8D illustrates another embodiment of fracturing valve 500 in fracturing mode. In
such embodiment, inner surface of first sleeve 202 can have a curved void 208 within the inner
surface, radially creating an exterior curvature of first sleeve 202. In fracturing mode, curved
void 208 can be above insert port 101. The slope within the inner surface of first sleeve 202 can
cause stop ball 502 to overcome the force on string 601 easier. A steep angle creates more force
                                                 - 14 -

in the axial direction. As such, frac ball 501 can require less force to push stop ball 502 into the
curved inner wall of sliding sleeve 202.
