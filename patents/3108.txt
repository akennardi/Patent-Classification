CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
 [1]        This application         claims the priority       of Chinese Patent
Application No.           <removed-apn>12.0, entitled "Adaptive Neural
Network Control Method For Arch-Shaped Microelectromechanical
System,"      filed on March 28,          2018, the content of which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
 [2]        The present disclosure relates to an arch-shaped
microelectromechanical system, and specifically                      to an adaptive
neural network control method for an arch-shaped
microelectromechanical system.
BACKGROUND
 [31        A microelectromechanical system               (MEMS) is a complex
micro-device or an independent intelligent system that
integrates      micro sensor,         micro actuator,       micro energy source,
signal processing and control circuits, high-performance
electronic      integrated        device,   interfaces,      communication,         etc.
The MEMS technology is            a revolutionary new technology involving
many subject areas           such as microelectronics, information and
automatic control,           mechanics,    material,     and dynamics.      The MEMS
technology is       widely used in       new high technology industries              and
is a key technology related to the science and technology
development, economic prosperity and security of a nation.
 [4]        Nonlinear factors          (such as uncertainty in modeling,
environmental changes, aging of components, and self-excited
vibrations)       are inevitable.        Once a MEMS fails,     it  will  certainly
lead to chain reactions,             and the failure    of an entire     equipment,
thus     causing major safety accidents, economic losses and
                                            1

adverse social            impacts.    Due to the influences by factors               such
as manufacturing defects, external disturbances, hysteresis
loops and immeasurable states,                    and the uncertainty in
mathematical models of the MEMS, it is difficult to obtain an
accurate         model for a control object.             An arch-shaped MEMS is          a
high-order, multi-field coupling and parameter time-variable
complex nonlinear system. However,                   the existing     control methods
for MEMS cannot properly solve control problems of output
constraints, chaotic oscillations, immeasurable states                              and
unknown dynamics in the arch-shaped MEMS.
SUMMARY
 [51         The purpose of the present disclosure is to provide an
adaptive neural network control method for an arch-shaped
microelectromechanical system. The present disclosure
facilitates the stability analysis and proof, and has
characteristics            including low requirement on modeling accuracy,
low calculation complexity, high arithmetic speed, good
operation system stability, and high motion accuracy.

 [46]    Beneficial effects: As             compared with the existing
technologies, the present disclosure has                     the following
advantages.     In    the adaptive neural network control method for
the arch-shaped microelectromechanical system of the present
disclosure, a symmetric barrier Lyapunov function                         is used to
ensure that an output constraint of the arch-shaped
microelectromechanical          system is      not violated,         and meanwhile,
it is convenient for an analysis and proof of a stability;                            a
RBF neural network having an adaptive rule is adopted to
estimate an unknown nonlinear function with                       an arbitrarily
small error, which lowers requirements of accurately
constructing the system model and suppresses impacts from
system parameter variations;             and a problem that a derivative
is repeatedly required for a virtual control item in a
traditional backstepping control is addressed by introducing
an extended state tracking differentiator, which reduces the
calculation complexity and accelerates the arithmetic speed.
In the control method of the present disclosure, the extended
state tracking differentiator and a state observer are fused
in a backstepping framework. According to the method,
requirements for measurable state variables                       and relevant
physical sensors are reduced, impacts from the chaotic
oscillations and the output constraints                   on the system are
suppressed,     and the operation stability             and motion accuracy of
the   system are improved.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[56]    The present disclosure is    further described below in
combination with the accompanying drawings and the embodiment.
However,   the accompanying drawings and the embodiment are not

[57]    Embodiment
[58]    An adaptive neural network control method for an
arch-shaped microelectromechanical system includes the
following steps.
[59]    In  step a, in order to reveal inherent properties of the
arch-shaped microelectromechanical system and easy to design
                                  9

a controller, the nonlinear dynamics of the arch-shaped
microelectromechanical system is investigated using phase
diagrams,        time histories,             a largest Lyapunov exponent                and a
bifurcation diagram, and a system model of the arch-shaped
microelectromechanical system is constructed based on an
Euler-Bernoulli beam, to obtain:
                                                                          3

 [601       In  expression         (1),      m,      h,   a1, b,  R,  and bH    represents
dimensionless parameters,                    q(t)     represents a state      variable,       w,
represents a frequency, and                     u(t)    represents a control input. The
schematic diagram of the arch-shaped microelectromechanical
system is        shown in Fig.            1.
 [61]       In step b,       an adaptive neural network controller for
suppressing chaotic oscillations of the                            arch-shaped
microelectromechanical system and ensuring state constraints
of the system is         constructed. When the controller                 is   constructed,
an unviolated output constraint of the arch-shaped
microelectromechanical system is ensured using a symmetric
barrier Lyapunov function, a RBF neural network having an
adaptive rule           is adopted to estimate an unknown nonlinear
function with an arbitrarily small error, an extended state
tracking differentiator                  is    introduced to address a problem of
a derivative         repeatedly required for a virtual                   control item in
a backstepping control,                 a state         observer is  designed to obtain
immeasurable state           information, and the extended state                    tracking
differentiator and the state observer are fused in a
backstepping framework.

 [631        In   expression          (2),      the system output                Y satisfies      a
constraint          condition,          that      is,      |yl k,,,   where      k1 >O.
 [64]        For the convenience of designing the controller,
operation mechanisms of the arch-shaped microelectromechanical
system need to be revealed. Parameters of the system are set
to be       a,=7.993,       b=119.9883,      h=0.3,       R=0.02,      m=0.1,     w=0.4706   and
u(t)=0.      The differential              equation is              solved using the
fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm.                              Figs. 2-3 illustrate          phase
diagrams        and time histories                  under different excitation
amplitudes           R.     It  can be        known from Figs.              2-3     that   chaotic
oscillations             appear in      the arch-shaped microelectromechanical
system.
 [651        As illustrated           in     Fig.     4,    the Lyapunov exponent becomes
a positive value in a short time. It                                 is obvious that chaotic
oscillations             appear in      the arch-shaped microelectromechanical
system. Fig. 5 is a bifurcation diagram for R -x, of the
arch-shaped microelectromechanical                             system, and further           reveals
periodic oscillation states and chaos motions.
 [661        The chaotic oscillations of the arch-shaped
microelectromechanical system inevitably lead to the
deterioration of the system performance.                                   Therefore, it is
necessary to provide an effective control scheme to suppress
the chaotic oscillations of the arch-shaped
microelectromechanical system.
 [67]        In step b,          the process of constructing the adaptive
neural network controller for suppressing the chaotic
oscillations             of the arch-shaped microelectromechanical                            system
includes the following steps.

the proof of Theorem 1 is                            finished.
 [119]        Simulation result analysis
 [120]        The reference               trajectory             is    selected as        x,=0.4sin(2t)     and
the output constraint                     is   defined to be              lyJ<k,,=0.43  . It    can be seen
from the above description                             that       |s,(t)I<k,,=0.03 is     tenable.        The
parameters of the proposed controller are selected as                                                  c,=8,
 c21  =8,    c22 =0.1,     g 2 =1,     m2 =10,      and n2 =5.           The parameters of the
extended state observer are designed as                                         K,= 1    and K2= 1. The
parameters of the extended state tracking differentiator are
selected          as    b2 1=3 ,   b=2 2 300,     d,=0.022,      and a, =0.3. An initial            value of
Y  2 (t)  is   0.02.      Moreover,           the RBF neural network includes 9 nodes,
the weight factor                    nz e[-6,6]     and the width              s,=3   of the Gaussian
function.
 [121]        Figs.        6(a)-6(c) show the first error function under
different           R    values.          It    is     obvious that            the tracking
performance between the reference trajectory and the actual
trajectory is achieved. Figs.                                6(d)-6(f) show that all the
tracking errors                 are less         than ±0.03.             lyI<k,   is  guaranteed after
the symmetric barrier                       Lyapunov function is                    used.    In  addition,

as compared with the phase diagrams in Fig. 2 and the time
histories in Fig. 3,      it can be known that the arch-shaped
microelectromechanical system immediately attains a steady
state  and its   chaotic oscillations       subjected to the distributed
electrostatic actuation are also completely suppressed.
 [122]   Figs.   7-8 reveal observer performances of the                   state
observer.   It  can be seen from Figs.       7-8 that     the state      observer
can precisely estimates actual signals,               and reduce the
restrictions on physical          sensors. Although the arch-shaped
microelectromechanical        system has the unknown parameters,               the
partial state-constraint and the chaotic oscillations,
observer errors    quickly converge to zero with less            oscillation.
 [123]   Fig.   9 illustrates control inputs of the               arch-shaped
microelectromechanical       system under the actuation of static               DC
voltages and harmonic AC voltages           for different        R   values.    It
can be seen from Fig.     9 that      4 curves of the control inputs of
the arch-shaped microelectromechanical system can remain
consistent at a fast rate. Meanwhile, it is also illustrated
that the proposed controller has a better anti-disturbance
ability.
