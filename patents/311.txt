Field
[0001]       This application is a divisional application of Australian patent application no.
<removed-apn>, which in turn claims priority from AU<removed-apn>, AU<removed-apn> and
US62/370299. The specification for each of these applications is entirely incorporated herein by
reference.
[0001a]      The invention relates to a method for treating cancer or a symptom associated with
cancer. The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an extract from
a Cannabis plant, and its use in the treatment of cancer or a symptom associated with cancer.
Background
[0002]       The biological activity of Cannabis is well known, and has led it to become a
"recreational" drug. However, with the discovery of a class of cannabinoid (CB) receptors, and
the relaxation of laws regulating Cannabis use - in some jurisdictions decriminalisation - there
now exists the opportunity to explore the potential of Cannabis as a source of new therapeutics.
[0003]       There is also a growing movement of patients suffering from severe diseases, such
as cancer, to seek natural remedies as alternative or complementary therapy.
[0004]       Accordingly, there is a continuing need to develop new treatments for cancer or its
symptoms, which is derived, at least in part, from a natural source. Advantageously, the
present invention may provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising a Cannabis extract that
shows an efficacy comparable to an existing cancer chemotherapy.
Summary
[0005]       The invention provides a method of treating cancer or a symptom associated with
cancer comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a
pharmaceutical composition comprising a Cannabis extract. In some embodiments, the cancer
is breast cancer. Also provided is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a Cannabis extract
and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants, excipients
or any combination thereof.
[0006]       In a further aspect, there is provided use of a Cannabis extract in the preparation of
a medicament for treating cancer or a symptom associated with cancer.

Description of Embodiment(s)
[0009]        The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a

                                                     -3
Cannabis extract and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents,
adjuvants, excipients or any combination thereof.
[0010]        Cannabis plants produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites, including
cannabinoids, terpenes and terpenoids, sterols, triglycerides, alkanes, squalenes, tocopherols,
carotenoids and alkaloids. The mix of these secondary metabolites varies depending on
several factors, including Cannabis variety, part of the Cannabis plant extracted, method of
extraction, processing of the extract, and season.
[0011]       There are several varieties of Cannabis plant, which have been described under two
distinct naming conventions. One of these conventions identifies three distinct species of
Cannabis plant, namely Cannabis sativa Linnaeus, Cannabis indica LAM., and Cannabis
ruderalis. Another convention identifies all Cannabis plants as belonging to the Cannabis sativa
L. species, with the various varieties divided amongst several subspecies, including: Cannabis
sativa ssp. sativa and ssp. indica. As used herein, the term "Cannabis"refers to any and all of
these plant varieties.
[0012]       Extracts of Cannabis may be prepared by any means known in the art. The extracts
may be formed from any part of the Cannabis plant containing cannabinoid, terpene and
terpenoid compounds. Extracts may be formed by contacting an extractant with a leaf, seed,
trichome, flower, keif, shake, bud, stem or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the
extract is formed from the flowers and shake of a Cannabis plant. Any suitable extractant
known in the art may be used, including, for example, alcohols (e.g. methanol, ethanol,
propanol, butanol, propylene glycol etc.), water, hydrocarbons (e.g. butane, hexane, etc.), oils
(e.g. olive oil, vegetable oil, essential oil, etc.), a polar organic solvent (e.g. ethyl acetate,
polyethylene glycol, etc.) or a supercritical fluid (e.g. liquid C02). The extractant may be
completely or partially removed prior to incorporation of the Cannabis extract into the
pharmaceutical composition, or it may be included in the pharmaceutical composition as a
carrier. The extractant may be removed by heating the extract optionally under reduced
pressure (e.g. under vacuum). It will be appreciated that some of the more volatile plant
metabolites (such as terpenes) may also be removed with the extractant. Accordingly, in some
embodiments, removing the extractant may enrich the cannabinoid fraction of the extract. In
some embodiments, the extract is filtered to remove particulate material, for example, by
passing the extract through filter paper or a fine sieve (e.g. a sieve with pore sizes of 5 ptm).
[0013]        In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract is formed by applying heat and

                                                  -4
pressure to the plant material. Typically, in these embodiments, no extractant is required.
[0014]       In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract is a Cannabis oil. As used herein, a
"Cannabisoil" is an extract formed by contacting at least a part of a Cannabis plant with an oil.
The extracting oil may optionally be removed. Extracting oils may be selected from olive oil,
hemp oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, vegetable oil, canola oil, grape seed oil, almond oil, medium
chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, and any other edible oil, or a combination thereof.
[0015]       In some embodiments, one or more additional compounds (e.g. cannabinoid,
terpene or terpenoid compounds) may be added to the Cannabis extract. The addition of
compounds may be to compensate for natural variations in the relative amounts of certain
compounds being expressed in the Cannabis plant. The added compounds may be synthetic
versions of the desired compounds, they may be purified compounds obtained from other
Cannabis extracts, or they may be added by blending two or more Cannabis extracts.
[0016]       The term "cannabinoid" as used herein relates to any cannabinoid that have been
isolated from a Cannabis plant or synthetically created to have activity involving the
endocannabinoid system.
[0017]       The term "cannabinoid fraction" is used to describe the combination of cannabinoid
compounds present in the Cannabis extract.
[0018]       The term "terpenes" or "terpenoids" as used herein refers to a class of hydrocarbon
molecules, which often provide a unique smell. Terpenes are derived from units of isoprene,
which has the molecular formula     C5 H8 . The basic molecular formula of terpenes are multiples of
the isoprene unit, i.e. (C5 Hs), where n is the number of linked isoprene units. Terpenoids are
terpene compounds that have been further metabolised in the plant, typically through an
oxidative process, and therefore usually contain at least one oxygen atom.
[0019]       The term "terpene fraction" is used to describe the combination of terpene and
terpenoid compounds present in the Cannabis extract.
[0020]       One embodiment provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a Cannabis
extract and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants,
excipients or any combination thereof, wherein the Cannabis extract comprises either:
          A.
             -  2 0.3% w/w terpene fraction;
             -  2 50% w/w A 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC);

                                                 -5
             -   2 0.3% w/w Cannabigerol (CBG); and
             -   5 0.5% w/w Cannabinodiol (CBN)
         or
         B.
             -   2 0.5% w/w terpene fraction;
             -   2 60% w/w CBD;
             -   < 3% w/w THC; and
             -   5 0.1% w/w CBN.
[0021]       Another embodiment provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a Cannabis
extract and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants,
excipients or any combination thereof, the Cannabis extract comprising a terpene fraction
comprising:
            *     B-caryophyllene in an amount of at least 11% by weight of the terpene fraction,
                  and
             one or more of:
                 - linalool in an amount of at least 5% by weight of the terpene fraction; and
                 - B-pinene in an amount of at least 1% by weight of the terpene fraction.
Cannabinoid Fraction
[0022]       The cannabinoid fraction typically accounts for the majority of the compounds
present in the Cannabis extract.
[0023]        In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract may comprise about 35% to about 95%
by weight cannabinoids, for example, about 40% to about 90%, about 45% to about 70% or
about 45% to about 55% by weight of the Cannabis extract. In some embodiments, the
Cannabis extract comprises about 5% to about 65% by weight of non-cannabinoids, for
example, about 5% to about 50%, about 10% to about 40% by weight or about 15% to about
30% by weight non-cannabinoids.
[0024]       To date, over 100 cannabinoids have been identified in Cannabis extracts. A
comprehensive list of these cannabinoids may be found in Mahmoud A. El Sohly and Waseem
Gul, "Constituents of Cannabis Sativa." In Handbook of Cannabis Roger Pertwee (Ed.) Oxford
University Press (2014) (ISBN: 9780199662685). Cannabinoids that have been identified in
Cannabis plants include: Cannabigerol (E)-CBG-C5, Cannabigerol monomethyl ether (E)

[0025]       The cannabinoid fraction may comprise a main cannabinoid.
  9
A -Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD) may be the main cannabinoid. The main
cannabinoid may be present in the Cannabis extract in an amount of at least about 40%, about
45%, about 50% or about 55% by weight of the Cannabis extract. Accordingly, when THC is
the main cannabinoid, the Cannabis extract may comprise at least about 40%, 45%, 50% or
55% by weight A 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), for example, 40-97% or 50-90% by weight of
A 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). When CBD is the main cannabinoid, the Cannabis extract may
comprise at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55% or 60% by weight CBD, for example, 40-97% or
50-90% by weight of CBD.
[0026]       In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract is enriched in one or the other of THC
or CBD. It has been shown that endocannabinoids (i.e. naturally occurring cannabinoids),
including THC and CBD, interact with a class of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) named
the "cannabinoid receptors", e.g. the CB1 or CB2 receptors. However, structurally related
cannabinoid compounds may have vastly different activity. For example, it has been reported
that THC is a CB1 agonist, and that CBD is a CB1 antagonist. Accordingly, in the present
invention, the Cannabis extract contains 50-90% by weight of only one of THC and CBD. It will
be appreciated that Cannabis extracts comprising 50-90% of THC, may comprise low amounts
of CBD, for example, less than 50% by weight CBD, or less than 40%, 30%, 20%, 15%, 10%,
5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.5% or 0.1% by weight CBD, or may not comprise any measurable
amount of CBD. Similarly, Cannabis extracts comprising 50-90% of CBD, may comprise low
amounts of THC, for example, less than 50% by weight THC, or less than 40%, 30%, 20%,
15%, 10%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.5% or 0.1% by weight THC or may not comprise any
measurable amount of THC.
[0027]       In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract may comprise 50-80% by weight THC
or CBD, 50-75% by weight THC or CBD, 50-70% by weight THC or CBD, 50-65% by weight
THC or CBD, 52-80% by weight THC or CBD, 53-80% THC or CBD, or 52-65% by weight THC
or CBD.
[0028]       In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract may comprise THC and CBD in a
combined weight of 50-90% by weight of the composition. In these embodiments, the ratio of
THC to CBD may be about 1:1, for example, the ratio of THC to CBD may be from 100:0 to
0:100, 100:1 to 1:100, 80:1 to 1:80, 60:1 to 1:60, 40:1 to 1:40 or 20:1 to 1:20.
[0029]       Typically, the Cannabis extract may also comprise other cannabinoids in addition to
THC and/or CBD. These cannabinoids include A 9-Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA),

                                                  -8
A 9-Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), (-)-Cannabidivarin (CBDV), Cannabinodiol (CBN) and
Cannabigerol (CBG). Each of these cannabinoids may be present in an amount from 0.001% to
40% by weight of the Cannabis extract. For example, CBN may be present in an amount of not
more than 0.5% by weight of the extract, for example, not more than 0.4%, 0.3%, 0.2% or 0.1%
by weight of the extract. CBN may be present in the Cannabis extract in an amount of 0.001
0.5% or 0.001-0.1% by weight. CBG may be present in an amount of at least 0.3% by weight of
the extract, for example, 0.3-10% or 0.35-5% by weight of the extract.
[0030]       In some embodiments, certain cannabinoids may be absent, or present in non
detectable amounts (e.g. less than 0.001% by weight of the analyte). In some embodiments,
the Cannabis extract may exclude one or more of the following cannabinoids:
A 9-Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), Cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), Cannabinodiol (CBN),
(-)-Cannabidivarin (CBDV) and Cannabichromene (CBC).
Terpene fraction
[0031]       The Cannabis extract comprises non-cannabinoid compounds, which typically
includes a terpene fraction. In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract comprises a terpene
fraction in an amount of less than 50% by weight, for example, less than 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%,
25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2% or 1% by weight of the extract. In
some embodiments, the Cannabis extract may comprise terpene and terpenoid compounds in
an amount of at least 0.001% by weight of the extract, for example, at least 0.005%, 0.01%,
0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.25%, 0.3%, 0.35%, 0.4%, 0.45%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 10%,
 15% or more of the total weight of the extract. In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract
comprises about 0.001% to about 50% by weight of terpene and terpenoid compounds, for
example, about 0.01% to about 50% by weight, about 0.01% to about 10% by weight, about
0.01% to about 6% by weight or about 0.01 to about 5% by weight of the composition.
[0032]       Typically, the terpene fraction in the plant material used to form the extract may
have a different terpene/terpenoid profile than the terpene profile of the final extract, both in
terms of the amounts of specific compounds in the terpene fraction and the weight of the
terpene fraction relative to the other components. For example, a Cannabis flower may
comprise about 20% by weight cannabinoids and about 3% by weight terpenes. Following
extraction and concentration (i.e. removal of the extractant), the amount of cannabinoids may
increase to an amount of about 50-90% by weight and the terpene fraction may amount to
about 0.1-6% by weight of the Cannabis extract. This typical scenario shows that while the
cannabinoids are concentrated when the extractant is removed, the relative amount of the
terpene fraction is reduced, likely due to the volatility of many of the terpenes/terpenoids

                                                   -9
present in the terpene fraction. Therefore, the profile of the terpene fraction present in the
Cannabis extract is significantly different from the profile of the terpene fraction that exists in
Nature.
[0033]       The efficacy of a pharmaceutical composition may be enhanced when the terpene
fraction has a certain profile, i.e. a certain proportion of particular terpenes/terpenoids are
present in the extract. It is believed that the increase in efficacy may be synergistic (i.e. non
additive). It is also believed that the presence of specific components in the terpene fraction
may enhance the patient's tolerance to cannabinoid therapy.
[0034]       A variety of terpenes and terpenoids have also been identified in Cannabis extracts,
including monoterpenes, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids. For example,
the following terpenes and terpenoids have been identified in Cannabis extracts:
Alloaromadendrene, allyl hexanoate, benzaldehyde, (Z)-a-cis-bergamotene, (Z)-a-trans
bergamotene, B-bisabolol, epi-a-bisabolol, B-bisabolene, borneol (camphol), cis-y-bisabolene,
bomeol acetate (bomyl acetate), a-cadinene, camphene, camphor, cis-carveol, caryophyllene
(B-caryophyllene), a-humulene (a-caryophyllene), y-cadinene, A-3-carene, caryophyllene oxide,
 1,8-cineole, citral A, citral B, cinnameldehyde, a-copaene (aglaiene), y-curcumene, B-cymene,
B-elemene, y-elemene, ethyl decdienoate, ethyl maltol, ethyl propionate, ethylvanillin,
eucalyptol, a-eudesmol, B-eudesmol, y-eudesmol, eugenol, cis-B-famesene ((Z)-B-farnesene),
trans-a-farnesene, trans-B-famesene, trans-y-bisabolene, fenchone, fenchol (norbomanol,
B-fenchol), geraniol, a-guaiene, guaiol, methyl anthranilate, methyl salicylate, 2-methyl-4
heptanone, 3-methyl-4-heptanone, hexyl acetate, ipsdienol, isoamyl acetate, lemenol, limonene,
d-limonene (limonene), linolool (linalyl alcohol, B-linolool), a-longipinene, menthol, y-muurolene,
myrcene (B-myrcene), nerolidol, trans-nerolidol, nerol, B-ocimene (cis-ocimene), octyl acetate,
a-phellandrene, phytol, a-pinene (2-pinene), B-pinene, pulegone, sabinene, cis-sabinene
hydrate (cis-thujanol), B-selinene, a-selinene, y-terpinene, terpinolene (isoterpine), terpineol
(a-terpineol), terpineol-4-ol, a-terpinene (terpilene), a-thujene (origanene), vanillin, viridiflorene
(ledene), and a-ylange. In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract comprises two or more of
terpenes or terpenoids, for example, the Cannabis extract may any or all of the above
mentioned terpenes and terpenoids, including combinations of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more of
the above terpenes and terpenoids.
[0035]        It is believed that the presence of the particular terpenes/terpenoids in the specified
amounts present in the terpene fraction is associated with increased efficacy of the
pharmaceutical composition in in vivo studies (see Example 2).

                                                  - 10
[0036]        The Cannabis extract included in the pharmaceutical compositions preferably
comprises B-caryophyllene in an amount of at least 11% by weight of the terpene fraction. It is
believed that B-caryophyllene may counteract the sedative effects of some of the cannabinoids.
[0037]        In some embodiments, the extract comprises B-carylophyllene in amount of at least
about 11%, about 12%, about 13%, about 14% or about 15% by weight of the terpene fraction.
In some embodiments, the extract comprises less than about 60%, about 55%, about 50%, or
about 45% by weight of the terpene fraction. Any of the minimum levels may be combined with
a maximum level without limitation, save for the requirement that the minimum level be below
the maximum water level. For example, in some embodiments, the extract may comprise B
caryophyllene in an amount from 11% to 60% by weight of the total terpene fraction, for
example, from 13% to 60%, from 14% to 60%, from 15% to 60%, from 15% to 50% or from 15%
to 45% by weight of the terpene fraction.
[0038]        The Cannabis extract may also comprise one or more of: B-myrcene, D-limonene,
linalool, a nerolidol (e.g. nerolidol 1 and/or 2) and a pinene (e.g. a-pinene and/or B-pinene).
[0039]         In some embodiments, the extract also comprises B-myrcene. It is believed that B
myrcene may enhance the bioavailability of the cannabinoids present in the extract and/or may
assist in allowing the cannabinoids to pass the blood-brain-barrier. Myrcene may be present in
the extract in an amount of at least 0.4% by weight of the total composition, for example, from
0.4% to about 40% by weight of the total composition. Myrcene may be present in the extract in
an amount of up to 50% by weight of the terpene fraction, for example, from 0.05% to 50% by
weight, from 0.05% to 25% by weight, from 0.05% to 5% by weight of the terpene fraction.
[0040]        In some embodiments, the ratio of B-caryophyllene to myrcene is greater than about
30:1, for example, 40:1, 50:1, 60:1, 70:1, 80:1, 90:1 or 97.5:1. In some embodiments, the ratio
of B-caryophyllene to myrcene is less than 170:1, for example, 160:1, 150:1, 140:1 or 130:1. In
some embodiments, the ratio of B-caryophyllene to myrcene is within a particular range of
ratios, such as any combination of the above described ratios, for example, from 30:1 to 170:1,
40:1 to 160:1, 50:1 to 150:1, 60:1 to 140:1, 70:1 to 130:1, 80:1 to 120:1 or 90:1 to 110:1.
[0041]        Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene having the molecular formula C10 H16 . There are
a number of different naturally occurring isomers; however, the most common form is the
dextrorotatory isomer, namely D-limonene. Limonene may be present in the extract in an
amount of at least about 0.1% by weight of the terpene fraction, for example, from 0.1 to about
10% by weight of the terpene fraction. In some embodiments, limonene is absent from the

                                                  - 11
extract, or only present in an amount below the limit of detection.
[0042]        Linalool is a terpenoid that is found in many flower and spice plants having the
molecular formula C10 H180. It is believed that when linalool is present in a Cannabis extract,
that is may provide a sedative effect. In some embodiments, linalool may be present in an
amount of at least 0.05% by weight of the terpene fraction. In some preferred embodiments,
linalool is present in an amount of at least 5% by weight of the terpene fraction. In other
embodiments, linalool is present in amount of from 0.05% to 25% by weight of the terpene
fraction, for example, from 0.1% to 20% by weight of the terpene fraction.
[0043]        Nerolidol is a sesquiterpenoid having the molecular formula of  C15 H2 6 0. It exists in
Nature in two isomeric forms, namely nerolidol 1 and nerolidol 2, which differ in the geometry
around a central olefin, i.e. either cis or trans isomers. The extract may comprise nerolidol (i.e.
both nerolidol 1 and nerolidol 2) in an amount of at least 0.01% by weight of the terpene
fraction, for example, from 0.01% to 20% by weight of the terpene fraction. Typically, nerolidol 1
is present in greater amount relative to nerolidol 2; however, in other embodiments, nerolidol 2
may be present in a greater amount relative to nerolidol 1. The ratio of nerolidol 1 to nerolidol 2
may be about 1:1, about 2:1, about 2:1, about 3:1, about 1:3, about 4:1, about 1:4, about 5:1, or
about 1:5. In some embodiments, nerolidol 1 or nerolidol 2 may be absent (or present in an
amount below the limit of detection). Nerolidol 1 may be present in the extract in an amount of
at least about 0.01% by weight of the terpene fraction, for example, from 0.01% to 20% or 0.1 to
 15% by weight of the terpene fraction. Nerolidol 2 may be present in the extract in an amount of
at least about 0.01% by weight of the terpene fraction, for example, 0.01% to 5% or 0.1% to 2%
by weight of the terpene fraction.
[0044]        Pinene is a bicyclic monoterpene having the molecular formula C10 H16. Pinene is
found in Nature in two isomeric forms: a-pinene and B-pinene. The extract may comprise
pinene (i.e. a-pinene and B-pinene) in an amount of at least 5% by weight of the terpene
fraction, for example, at least 6%, 8%, 10%, 15% or 20% by weight of the composition. In some
embodiments, a-pinene is present in greater amount relative to B-pinene. In other
embodiments, B-pinene is present in a greater amount relative to a-pinene. The ratio of
a-pinene to B-pinene may be about 1:1, about 2:1, about 2:1, about 10:1, about 1:10, about
 15:1, about 1:15, about 20:1, about 1:20, about 25:1, about 1:25, about 30:1 or about 1:30. In
some embodiments, a-pinene or B-pinene may be absent (or present in an amount below the
limit of detection). a-Pinene may be present in the extract in an amount of at least about 0.01%
by weight of the terpene fraction, for example, from 0.01% to 5% by weight. B-pinene may be

                                                 - 12
present in the extract in an amount of at least about 0.01% by weight of the terpene fraction, for
example, 0.01% to 50% or 5% to 40% by weight of the terpene fraction.
[0045]        In some embodiments, the terpene fraction may be present in the composition in an
amount from 0.01% to 6% by weight of the extract and may comprise:
            *    B-caryophyllene in an amount of from 11% to 50% by weight of the terpene
                 fraction;
            *    optionally B-myrcene in an amount of from 0.01% to 40% by weight of the
                  terpene fraction;
            *    optionally D-limonene in an amount of from 0.01% to 10% by weight of the
                  terpene fraction;
            *    optionally linalool in an amount of from 5% to 20% by weight of the terpene
                 fraction;
            *    optionally B-pinene in an amount of from 1% to 50% by weight of the terpene
                 fraction;
            *    optionally a-pinene in an amount of from 0.01% to 5% by weight of the terpene
                 fraction;
            *    optionally nerolidol 1 in an amount of from 0.01% to 20% by weight of the terpene
                 fraction; and
            *    optionally nerolidol 2 in an amount of from 0.001% to 5% by weight of the terpene
                 fraction.
[0046]        In some embodiments, the extract further comprises humulene. It is believed that
that humulene may enhance the sedative properties of the extract. Humulene is also
sometimes called a-caryophyllene. Humulene may be present in the extract in an amount of at
least about 1% by weight of the terpene fraction, for example, from about 1% to about 25% or
about 5% to about 15% by weight of the terpene fraction.
[0047]        In some embodiments, the ratio of humulene to myrcene is greater than about 12:1,
for example, 14:1, 16:1, 18:1, 20:1, 22:1, 24:1, 25:1, 26:1, 27:1 or 28:1. In some embodiments,
the ratio of humulene to myrcene is less than 50:1, for example, 45:1, 40:1, 38:1, 36:1, 34:1,
33:1, 32:1, 31:1 or 30:1. In some embodiments, the ratio of humulene to myrcene is within a
particular range of ratios, such as any combination of the above described ratios, for example,
from 14:1 to 50:1, 16:1 to 40:1, 18:1 to 38:1, 20:1 to 36:1, 22:1 to 34:1, 24:1 to 33:1 or 26:1 to
30:1.
[0048]       The Cannabis extract may include additional terpenes and terpenoids which, it is

                                                - 13
believed, also potentiate the efficacy of the pharmaceutical compositions. These terpenes may
include one or more of a-bisabolol, caryophyllene oxide, p-cymene, isopulegol, ocimene,
a-terpinene, y-terpinene, 5-s-carene, guaiol, and terpinolene.
[0049]        In some embodiments, specific terpenes or terpenoids may be absent, or present in
non-detectable amounts (e.g. less than 0.001% by weight of the analyte). In some
embodiments, the Cannabis extract one or more of the following terpenes or terpenoids are
absent, or present in non-detectable amounts: camphene, 5-s-carene, geraniol, guaiol and
D-limonene.
[0050]        One exemplary Cannabis extract is set out in the table below. Amounts of
cannabinoids are reported as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
and amounts of terpenes are reported as determined by gas chromatography (GC). It will be
appreciated that, as the Cannabis extract is derived from Nature, the amount of each
component may vary in some cases by +/- 10%, +/- 25% or +/- 50%. The ranges of amounts
corresponding to each of these limits to account for the potential variation in the composition are
also shown in the following table.

[0051]        The pharmaceutical composition may further comprise one or more
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants, excipients or any combination thereof.
[0052]        The carrier, diluent, adjuvant and/or excipient are "pharmaceutically acceptable"
meaning that they are compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and is not
deleterious to a subject upon or following administration. The pharmaceutical compositions may
be formulated, for example, by employing conventional solid or liquid vehicles or diluents, as
well as pharmaceutical additives of a type appropriate to the mode of desired administration (for
example, excipients, binders, preservatives, stabilisers, flavours, etc.) according to techniques
such as those well known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation (See, for example,
Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., 2005, Lippincott Williams &
Wilkins). The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be any carrier included in the United
States Pharmacopeia/National Formulary (USP/NF), the British Pharmacopoeia (BP), the
European Pharmacopoeia (EP), or the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP). In some embodiments,
the carrier, diluent, adjuvant and/or excipient may be non-natural (e.g. synthetically produced).
[0053]        The pharmaceutical composition includes those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal,
topical (including buccal and sub-lingual), vaginal or parenteral (including intramuscular, sub
cutaneous and intravenous) administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation
or insufflation.
[0054]        The Cannabis extract, together with a conventional adjuvant, carrier, excipient or
diluent, may thus be placed into the form of pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosages

                                                 - 15
thereof, and in such form may be employed as solids, such as tablets or filled capsules, or
liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, or capsules filled with the same, all for
oral use, in the form of suppositories for rectal administration; or in the form of sterile injectable
solutions for parenteral (including subcutaneous) use.
[0055]       Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms thereof may comprise
conventional ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without additional active
compounds or principles, and such unit dosage forms may contain any suitable effective
amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily dosage range to be
employed.
[0056]        For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the Cannabis extract described
herein, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form
preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispensable
granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents,
flavouring agents, solubilisers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet
disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.
[0057]       Suitable carriers include magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar,
lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium
carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term "preparation" is
intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as
carrier providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without carriers, is
surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are
included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid forms
suitable for oral administration.
[0058]       Liquid form preparations include solutions, dispersions, suspensions, and
emulsions, for example, water or water-propylene glycol solutions. For example, parenteral
injection liquid preparations can be formulated as solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol
solution.
[0059]       Sterile liquid form compositions include sterile solutions, suspensions, emulsions,
syrups and elixirs. The Cannabis extract can be suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier, such as sterile water, sterile organic solvent or a mixture of both.

                                                  - 16
[0060]        Other liquid form preparations include those prepared by combining the Cannabis
extract with one or more naturally derived oils (e.g. an essential oil) or waxes. An "essential oil"
is an oil derived by extraction (e.g. steam extraction, or contacting the plant material with an
extractant) or pressing, which contains primarily hydrophobic, and generally fragrant,
components of the plant material. Suitable naturally derived oils and waxes include Sesame oil,
Olive oil, Arnica essential oil, Lavender essential oil, Lavender Spike essential oil, Frankincense
essential oil, Lemongrass essential oil, Cinnamon Leaf essential oil, Rosemary Cineole
essential oil, Rosemary essential oil, Bergamot essential oil, Myrrh essential oil, Sage essential
oil, Coconut oil, Bees wax and Hemp oil.
[0061]        The pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated for parenteral administration
(e. g. by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and may be presented in
unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-dose containers
optionally with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions,
solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulation agents such as
suspending, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in
powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilisation from solution, for
constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.
[0062]        Pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile injectable solutions
or dispersions, and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable
solutions. They should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and may be
preserved against oxidation and the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria or
fungi.
[0063]        The solvent or dispersion medium for the injectable solution or dispersion may
contain any of the conventional solvent or carrier systems, and may contain, for example, water,
ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the
like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.
[0064]        Pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use may be delivered by any
appropriate route including intravenous, intramuscular, intracerebral, intrathecal, epidural
injection or infusion.
[0065]        Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the Cannabis extract in the
required amount in the appropriate carrier with various other ingredients such as those

                                                  - 17
enumerated above, as required, followed by sterilisation. Generally, dispersions are prepared
by incorporating the various sterilised active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the
basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In
the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, preferred methods
of preparation are vacuum drying or freeze-drying of a previously sterile suspension of the
active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredients.
[0066]        When the active ingredients are suitably protected they may be orally administered,
for example, with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or it may be enclosed in
hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, or it may be compressed into tablets, or it may be
incorporated directly with the food of the diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active may
be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets,
troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like.
[0067]        The amount of active ingredient in therapeutically useful compositions should be
sufficient that a suitable dosage will be obtained.
[0068]        The tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like may also contain the components
as listed hereafter: a binder such as gum, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as
dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and
the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such a sucrose,
lactose or saccharin may be added or a flavouring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen,
or cherry flavouring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to
materials of the above type, a liquid carrier.
[0069]        Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the
physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with
shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a
sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavouring such as
cherry or orange flavour. Of course, any material used in preparing any dosage unit form should
be pharmaceutically pure and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the
active compound(s) may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and formulations,
including those that allow specific delivery of the active peptide to specific regions of the gut.
[0070]        Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active
component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavours, stabilising and thickening agents,

                                                - 18
as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely
divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums,
resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or other well-known suspending
agents.
[0071]       Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents include any and all solvents,
dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying
agents and the like.
[0072]       Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted, shortly
before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include
solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the
active component, colorants, flavours, stabilisers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners,
dispersants, thickeners, solubilising agents, and the like.
[0073]       For topical administration to the epidermis the active ingredients may be formulated
as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch. Ointments and creams may, for
example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening
and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in
general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents,
suspending agents, thickening agents, or colouring agents.
[0074]       Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges
comprising active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles
comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and
acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.
[0075]       Solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional
means, for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations may be provided in single
or multidose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this may be achieved by the patient
administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension.
[0076]       In the case of a spray, this may be achieved for example by means of a metering
atomising spray pump. To improve nasal delivery and retention the compounds according to the
invention may be encapsulated with cyclodextrins, or formulated with other agents expected to
enhance delivery and retention in the nasal mucosa.

                                                  - 19
[0077]        Administration to the respiratory tract may also be achieved by means of an aerosol
formulation in which the active ingredient is provided in a pressurised pack with a suitable
propellant such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) for example dichlorodifluoromethane,
trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gas.
[0078]        The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of
drug may be controlled by provision of a metered valve.
[0079]        Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in the form of a dry powder, for
example a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch,
starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).
Conveniently the powder carrier may form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition
may be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of, e.g. gelatin, or
blister packs from which the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler.
[0080]        In formulations intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including
intranasal formulations, the compound will generally have a small particle size for example of
the order of 5 to 10 microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in
the art, for example by micronisation.
[0081]        When desired, formulations adapted to give sustained release of the active
ingredient may be employed.
[0082]        The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form,
the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active
component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing
discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or
ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it
can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.
[0083]        It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit
form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein
refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each
unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired
therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for
the dosage unit forms are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of

                                                - 20
the active material and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations
inherent in the art of compounding such an active material for the treatment of cancer of an
associated symptom in living subjects having a diseased condition in which bodily health is
impaired.
[0084]        Also described herein are compositions absent a carrier where the compositions are
in unit dosage form. Accordingly, also provided is a medicament comprising the Cannabis
extract.
[0085]        In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises an active
agent other than the Cannabis extract. Any suitable active agent may be used provided that the
activity of the active agent and/or the Cannabis extract is not diminished when combined.
Preferably, the active agent is an anti-cancer drug. Suitable anti-cancer drugs include
trastuzumab (e.g., Herceptin.RTM.) or protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. lapatinib (e.g.,
Tykerb.RTM.)). In some embodiments, the subject has previously been administered, or is
currently being administered, an aromatase inhibitor. In some embodiments, the aromatase
inhibitor is selected from aminoglutethimide, testolactone (e.g., Teslac.RTM.), anastrozole (e.g.,
Arimidex.RTM.), letrozole (e.g., Femara.RTM.), exemestane (e.g., Aromasin.RTM.), vorozole
(e.g., Rivisor.RTM.), formestane (e.g., Lentaron.RTM.), megestrol acetate (e.g., Megase.RTM.),
and fadrozole (e.g., Afema.RTM.). In some embodiments, a subject with breast cancer has
previously been administered, or is currently being administered, an ER antagonist. In some
embodiments, the subject has previously been determined to have ER positive breast cancer.
Non-limiting exemplary ER antagonists include tamoxifen (e.g., Nolvadex.RTM., Istubal.RTM.,
and Valodex.RTM.) and fulvestrant (e.g., Faslodex.RTM.) or a combination thereof.
Methods of treatment
[0086]        In another aspect, also provided is a method for treating cancer or a symptom
associated with cancer. The method comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an
effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition described herein.
[0087]        The pharmaceutical compositions may be used to treat cancer or a symptom
associated with cancer. In particular, the pharmaceutical compositions may be effective in the
treatment of a breast cancer, for example, HER2 positive, triple negative and/or hormone
receptor positive breast cancer. In some embodiments, the breast cancer is HER2 positive
breast cancer. HER2 positive breast cancer is one of the more aggressive forms of breast
cancer, and accounts for about 20% of all breast cancers. HER2 is the abbreviation for "human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2" which is a protein expressed by HER2 positive breast

                                                - 21
tumour cells. In some embodiments, the breast cancer is triple negative breast cancer. There
are currently no targeted therapeutic options for triple negative breast cancer on the market. In
some embodiments, the breast cancer is hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The
inventors have shown that a Cannabis extract possesses efficacy against HER2+, triple
negative and hormone receptor positive breast cancer cells. In addition, for THC-rich extracts
(e.g. an extract comprising 2 0.3% w/w of the terpene fraction, 2 50% w/w
A 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); 2 0.3% w/w Cannabigerol (CBG); and 5 0.5% w/w
Cannabinodiol (CBN), the inventors have shown that the Cannabis extract has greater activity
against the tested breast cancer cells than THC alone (see Figures 5-8).
[0088]       The inventors observed that the volume of ectopic xenografts of human HER2
positive malignant cells are reduced following treatment with the pharmaceutical composition by
similar volumes compared to the approved drug lapatinib (see Figures 1, 2 and 3). The
reduction in tumour volume for the pharmaceutical compositions comprising a high-THC
Cannabis extract are greater than those for an equivalent dose of THC alone.
[0089]       Symptoms associated with cancer include unexplained weight loss, fever, fatigue,
pain, and skin changes. Symptoms specifically associated with breast cancer include
thickening or lumps forming in the breast tissue.
[0090]       Symptoms of cancer are also commonly associated with many, if not all, of existing
cancer therapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The present composition may also
be used to treat the symptoms of cancer therapy.
[0091]       By "effective amount" it is meant an amount sufficient that when administered to the
patient an amount of the drug is provided to achieve an effect. In the case of a therapeutic
method, this effect may be the treatment of cancer or a symptom associated with cancer.
Therefore, the "effective amount" may be a "therapeutically effective amount". By
"therapeutically effective amount" it is meant an amount sufficient that when administered to the
patient an amount of drug is provided to treat the disease or a symptom of the disease.
[0092]       As used herein, the terms "treating", "treatment", "treat" and the like mean affecting
a subject, tissue or cell to obtain a desired pharmacological and/or physiological effect. The
effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing, or reducing the severity
of, a disease or associated symptom, and/or may be therapeutic in terms of a partial or
complete cure of a disease. A reference to "treating" cancer therefore encompasses: (a)
inhibiting cancer cell growth, e.g. arresting tumour development or further development; (b)

                                                  - 22
relieving or ameliorating the effects of the cancer, i.e. causing regression of the effects of the
cancer; (c) reducing the incidence of metastasis; or (d) preventing the cancer or symptom
associated with cancer from occurring in a subject predisposed to cancer or at risk thereof so
that the cancer does not develop or occur in the subject.
[0093]       The method may comprise administering more than one pharmaceutical
composition of the present invention to the patient in need thereof. For example, in some
circumstances, it is preferred to administer a pharmaceutical composition high in THC and a
pharmaceutical composition high in CBD to the patient. These compositions may be
administered in an alternating order and separated by a period of time. The pharmaceutical
composition high in THC may comprise 2 50% w/w THC, 2 0.3% w/w CBG, 5 0.5% w/w CBN
and 2 0.3% w/w terpene fraction. The pharmaceutical composition high in CBD may comprise 2
60% w/w CBD,        3% w/w THC, 5 0.1% w/w CBN and 2 0.5% w/w terpene fraction.
[0094]       The method may also comprise administering an active agent other than the
 Cannabis extract. This active agent may be administered simultaneously or consecutively with
the Cannabis extract. By consecutively it is meant that each of the Cannabis extract and the
other active agent are administered separately and may be at different times. Typically, when
the Cannabis extract and the other active agent are administered consecutively they are
administered within 24 hours, or within 12, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 hour(s) of each other. The
 Cannabis extract may be administered before or after the other active agent. Further, the route
of administration for the Cannabis extract and the other active agent may be the same or
different.
[0095]       In another aspect, also provided is the use of the Cannabis extract in the
preparation of a medicament for the treatment of cancer or a symptom associated with cancer.
[0096]       Also provided is a kit comprising in separate parts:
(a)    an effective amount of the Cannabis extract; and
(b)    a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, adjuvant, excipient or a combination
       thereof.
[0097]       In some embodiments, the kit may comprise in a separate part (b') an effective
amount of an active agent other than the Cannabis extract. Part (b') may be included in the kit,
in addition to parts (a) and (b), or in place of part (b).
[0098]       In another aspect, there is provided the pharmaceutical composition for treating

                                               -  23
cancer or a symptom associated with cancer. The pharmaceutical composition may be any of
the pharmaceutical compositions described above, comprising any above-described
combination of components, provided that it comprises the Cannabis extract with the specified
terpene fraction. The cancer and its symptoms may also be any of those described above.
Examples
[0099]      The invention will be further described by way of non-limiting examples. It will be
understood to persons skilled in the art of the invention that many modifications may be made
without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

Example 2 - In vivo study comparing compositions comprising a Cannabis extract, THC
only and lapatinib against HER2 positive tumour volume
[0101]       Methodology. 5x10 6 viable BT474 human breast HER2+ adenocarcinoma cells
were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of 6-week-old athymic mice. When tumors
reached circa 200 mm3 , animals were randomly assigned to the following experimental groups
and the indicated treatments were started and maintained for 4 weeks:
[0102]       VEHICLE: sesame oil (THC vehicle, 3 times/week) + 0.5% hydroxypropylmethyl
cellulose + 0.1% Tween 80, in water (Lapatinib vehicle, daily)
[0103]       LAPATINIB (100mg/Kg, daily)
[0104]       THC (45mg/Kg, 3 times/week)
[0105]       THC+LAPATINIB
[0106]       THC AZ (45mg/Kg THC, 3 times/week). THC AZ comprises vehicle (sesame oil)
and AZ1 as described in Example 1.

                                                  - 25
[0107]       THC AZ + LAPATINIB
[0108]       All treatments were administered by oral gavage. Tumors were routinely measured
with external caliper, and volume was calculated as (4-rr/3) x (width/2) 2 x (length/2).
[0109]       Results are shown in Figures 1-4. In can be seen from Figure 1 that treatment with
the THC AZ composition results in a greater reduction in tumor volume than treatment with the
THC only and vehicle only treatments. Further, the efficacy of THC AZ is approximately the
same as the approved chemotherapy lapatinib (see Figures 2-4). Further, these data suggest
that the combination therapy of THC AZ and lapatinib is non-deleterious (Figure 3).

[0111]       Cells were then transferred to serum-free medium for 5h and after that, challenged
with the corresponding treatments (pure THC, THC-rich extract (AZ1) or the corresponding
vehicle -DMSO-). Cell viability was determined after 24h incubation with the different treatments
by violet crystal staining: 0.1% violet crystal in 20% methanol was added to the wells, and after

                                                   - 26
a 20min incubation at room temperature, the stained cells were resuspended in methanol. Cell
viability was determined by measuring absorbance at 570nm, and expressed as % versus
vehicle-treated cells (set at 100%).
[0112]        The results of these experiments are shown in Figures 5-7. In each experiment, the
Cannabis extract demonstrated enhanced efficacy relative to THC alone. The Cannabis extract
demonstrated enhanced efficacy relative to THC alone against each of the tested HER2 positive
(figure 5), triple negative (figure 6) and hormone receptor positive (figure 7) breast cancer cells.
[0113]        The results of this example are summarised in Figure 8, which shows that the
 Cannabis extract is effective against all cancer cell lines tested.
