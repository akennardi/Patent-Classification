                                           ABSTRACT
        Methods and kits for diagnosing and determining prognosis of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma are described. An exemplary method for diagnosing head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in a subject may comprise assaying a saliva sample from
the subject for the presence of total protein, solCD44, and HPV, and using the combination of
total protein, HPV, and CD44 levels in a multivariate analysis to determine a combined score,
whereby an increase in score above a cut-off point distinguishes subjects with HNSCC, or an
elevated risk of future occurrence thereof, from subjects without HNSCC or at low risk of
future occurrence thereof.

                    ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT
         This invention was made with government support from the National Institutes of Health
under grant No. RO1CA1 18584-NIH. The government has certain rights in this invention.
                                               FIELD
         The subject matter disclosed herein generally relates to methods and kits for the
detection, treatment, and prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
                                         BACKGROUND
         Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) affects 50,000 people in the United
States and 600,000 people world-wide each year. The main risk factors include tobacco and
alcohol use and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
         To date, there is no widely accepted HNSCC screening program or test (see, e.g., Vokes
et al., NEngl JMed, 328:184-94 (1993); Lingen et al., Curr Opin Oncol, 13:176-82 (2001);
Forastiere et al., NEngl JMed 345:1890-1900 (2001); Patton, Orol Oncol, 39:708-723 (2003);
O'Hara et al., Clin Otolaryngol,27:133-4 (2002); Smart, Cancer 72:1061-5 (1993);
Sankaranarayanan et al., Cancer, 88:664-73 (2000); Sankaranarayanan et al., Lancet 365:1927
33 (2005)) because the gold standard, screening by physical exam followed by biopsy, has
limited sensitivity and specificity (64% and 74%, respectively) (Brocklehurst et al., Cochrane
DatabaseSyst Rev, 11:CDO04150 (2010)) and molecular diagnostic tests are still under
development (Nagler, Oral Oncol., 45:1006-10 (2009); Mahfouz et al., Eur Arch
Otorhinolaryngol,267:851-60 (2010)). Adjunctive techniques for oral cancer detection that use
dyes, autofluorescence, or exfoliative cytology are available, but recent reviews question
whether they improve early detection rates (Patton et al., JAm Dent Assoc, 139:896-905 (2008);
Lingen et al., Oral Oncol 44:10-22 (2008)). Therefore, efforts have focused on molecular
diagnostic tools. Several studies that tested saliva for RNA expression profiles (Li et al., Clin
CancerRes,10:8442-8450 (2004)), microRNA discovery (Park et al., Clin Cancer Res, 15:5473
5477 (2009)) and proteomic analysis (Hu et al., Clin CancerRes, 14:6246-6252 (2008)) show

promise but are somewhat complicated and not validated (Nagler, Oral Oncol., 45:1006-10
(2009); Mahfouz et al., Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,267:851-60 (2010)). As a result, the
majority of patients are diagnosed at a late stage, when cure rates are 40% or lower. Thus, early
detection tests are needed.
                                            SUMMARY

cancer where p16 staining is cytoplasmic and diffuse. In this case, CD44 stains in the membrane
and universally throughout the tumor. CD44 and EGFR colocalize on the cell membrane and
there is some cytoplasmic staining of EGFR as well.
        Figure 7 shows IHC staining of p 16, CD44, and EGFR in p16m tumors where nuclei stain
strongly for p16 and there is some cytoplasmic staining as well. However, CD44 membrane
staining is lost, only the invading lymphocytes retain CD44 expression. EGFR expression is not
seen at all.
                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
        The materials, compounds, compositions, and methods described herein may be
understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of specific aspects of
the disclosed subject matter, and the Examples included therein.
        Before the present materials, compounds, compositions, and methods are disclosed and
described, it is to be understood that the aspects described below are not limited to specific
synthetic methods or specific reagents, as such may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood
that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects only and is
not intended to be limiting.
        Also, throughout this specification, various publications are referenced. The disclosures
of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application
in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which the disclosed matter pertains. The
references disclosed are also individually and specifically incorporated by reference herein for
the material contained in them that is discussed in the sentence in which the reference is relied
upon.

    WO 2013/074793                                                            PCT/US2012/065282
         Definitions
         In this specification and in the claims that follow, reference will be made to a number of
terms, which shall be defined to have the following meanings:
         Throughout the specification and claims the word "comprise" and other forms of the
word, such as "comprising" and "comprises," means including but not limited to, and is not
intended to exclude, for example, other additives, components, integers, or steps.
         As used in the description and the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and
"the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
         "Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described event or circumstance
can or cannot occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance
occurs and instances where it does not.
         Ranges can be expressed herein as from "about" one particular value, and/or to "about"
another particular value. "About" can mean within 5% of the stated value. When such a range is
expressed, another aspect includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular
value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent
"about," it will be understood that the particular value forms another aspect. It will be further
understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other
endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. It is also understood that there are a number
of values disclosed herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as "about" that particular
value in addition to the value itself. For example, if the value "2000" is disclosed, then "about
2000" is also disclosed. It is also understood that when a value is disclosed, then "less than or
equal to" the value, "greater than or equal to the value" and possible ranges between values are
also disclosed, as appropriately understood by the skilled artisan. For example, if the value
"2000" is disclosed, then "less than or equal to 2000" as well as "greater than or equal to 2000"
is also disclosed. It is also understood that throughout the application data are provided in a
number of different formats and that this data represent endpoints and starting points and ranges
for any combination of the data points. For example, if a particular data point "10" and a
particular data point "15" are disclosed, it is understood that greater than, greater than or equal
to, less than, less than or equal to, and equal to 10 and 15 are considered disclosed as well as
between 10 and 15. It is also understood that each unit between two particular units are also
disclosed. For example, if 10 and 15 are disclosed, then 11, 12, 13, and 14 are also disclosed.
         References in the specification and concluding claims to parts by weight of a particular
element or component in a composition denotes the weight relationship between the element or
component and any other elements or components in the composition or article for which a part
                                                    4

    WO 2013/074793                                                           PCT/US2012/065282
by weight is expressed. Thus, in a compound comprising 2 parts by weight of component X and
5 parts by weight component Y, X and Y are present at a weight ratio of 2:5, and are present in
such ratio regardless of whether additional components are comprised in the composition.
         A weight percent (wt. %) of a component, unless specifically stated to the contrary, is
based on the total weight of the formulation or composition in which the component is included.
         The term "individual," "host," "subject," and "patient" are used interchangeably to refer
to any individual who is the target of diagnosis, prognosis, administration, or treatment. The
subject can be a vertebrate, for example, a mammal. Thus, the subject can be a human or
veterinary patient.
         A "biomarker" is any gene or protein whose level of expression in a tissue or cell is
altered compared to that of a normal or healthy cell or tissue.
         The term "prognosis" is recognized in the art and encompasses predictions about the
likely course of disease or disease progression, particularly with respect to likelihood of disease
remission, disease relapse, tumor recurrence, metastasis, and death. "Good prognosis" refers to
the likelihood that a patient afflicted with cancer, such as head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma, will remain disease-free (i.e., cancer-free). "Poor prognosis" is intended to mean the
likelihood of a relapse or recurrence of the underlying cancer or tumor, metastasis, or death.
Cancer patients classified as having a "good outcome" remain free of the underlying cancer or
tumor. In contrast, "bad outcome" cancer patients experience disease relapse, tumor recurrence,
metastasis, or death. In particular embodiments, the time frame for assessing prognosis and
outcome is, for example, less than one year, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, fifteen, twenty or more years. As used herein, the relevant time for assessing prognosis or
disease-free survival time begins with the surgical removal of the tumor or suppression,
mitigation, or inhibition of tumor growth. Thus, for example, in particular embodiments, a
"good prognosis" refers to the likelihood that a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patient
will remain free of the underlying cancer or tumor for a period of at least five, more particularly,
a period of at least ten years. In further aspects of the invention, a "bad prognosis" refers to the
likelihood that a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patient will experience disease relapse,
tumor recurrence, metastasis, or death within less than five years, more particularly less than ten
years. Time frames for assessing prognosis and outcome provided above are illustrative and are
not intended to be limiting.
         The term "treatment" refers to the medical management of a patient with the intent to
cure, ameliorate, stabilize, or prevent a disease, pathological condition, or disorder. This term
includes active treatment, that is, treatment directed specifically toward the improvement of a
                                                   5

    WO 2013/074793                                                            PCT/US2012/065282
disease, pathological condition, or disorder, and also includes causal treatment, that is, treatment
directed toward removal of the cause of the associated disease, pathological condition, or
disorder. In addition, this term includes palliative treatment, that is, treatment designed for the
relief of symptoms rather than the curing of the disease, pathological condition, or disorder;
preventative treatment, that is, treatment directed to minimizing or partially or completely
inhibiting the development of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder; and
supportive treatment, that is, treatment employed to supplement another specific therapy directed
toward the improvement of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder.
         The term "antibody" refers to natural or synthetic antibodies that selectively bind a target
antigen. The term includes polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. In addition to intact
immunoglobulin molecules, also included in the term "antibodies" are fragments or polymers of
those immunoglobulin molecules, and human or humanized versions of immunoglobulin
molecules that selectively bind the target antigen.
         Also, disclosed herein are materials, compounds, compositions, and components that can
be used for, can be used in conjunction with, can be used in preparation for, or are products of
the disclosed methods and compositions. These and other materials are disclosed herein, and it
is understood that when combinations, subsets, interactions, groups, etc. of these materials are
disclosed that while specific reference of each various individual and collective combinations
and permutation of these compounds may not be explicitly disclosed, each is specifically
contemplated and described herein. For example, if a composition is disclosed and a number of
modifications that can be made to a number of components of the composition are discussed,
each and every combination and permutation that are possible are specifically contemplated
unless specifically indicated to the contrary. This concept applies to all aspects of this disclosure
including, but not limited to, compositions and steps in methods of making and using the
disclosed compositions. Thus, if there are a variety of additional steps that can be performed it is
understood that each of these additional steps can be performed with any specific aspect or
combination of aspects of the disclosed methods, and that each such combination is specifically
contemplated and should be considered disclosed.
         Reference will now be made in detail to specific aspects of the disclosed materials,
compounds, compositions, components, devices, articles, and methods, examples of which are
illustrated in the following description and examples, and in the figures and their previous and
following description.

    WO 2013/074793                                                           PCT/US2012/065282
        Biomarker Assays
        Efficient, inexpensive, noninvasive assays for diagnosing and determining prognosis for
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are described. The disclosed assays involve
the detection of one or more biomarkers, such as CD44 (e.g., soluble CD44 (solCD44), in a
sample from the subject. U.S. Patent No. 8,088,591 by Franzmann et al. is incorporated by
reference in its entirety for its description of biomarkers that can be used to diagnose and
monitor HNSCC in a subject. Elevated levels of these biomarkers are able to distinguish cancer
patients from controls with high accuracy and specificity. However, these biomarkers are
reduced in certain subject populations despite the presence of HNSCC.
        Thus, disclosed are additional biomarkers and risk factors that may be used to improve
the accuracy and specificity of an HNSCC assay. For example, it has been shown that solCD44
and total protein levels combined are more effective at distinguishing HNSCC from controls than
either marker alone. However, solCD44 levels can be lower in subjects with human
papillomavirus (HPV) infection. In fact, bivariate analysis using solCD44 and total protein levels
works best in black men, wherein HPV infection is less common. Therefore, inclusion of HPV
status in a multivariate analysis can improve sensitivity and accuracy of the assay and allow for
detection of HPV+ HNSCC.
        Other biomarkers associated with HNSCC detection or prognosis may be used in
combination with total protein, solCD44, and HPV detection to improve sensitivity and/or
accuracy of the disclosed method. For example, solCD44 levels can vary based on age and
smoking status. Examples of HNSCC risk factors and demographic factors that may be used in
the multivariate analysis include tobacco exposure, alcohol exposure, race, ethnicity, dental
health, gender, level of education, age, general health, family history of cancer, sexual history
and socioeconomic status and using the one or more risk factors or demographic factors in the
multivariate analysis to determine the combined score.
        Therefore, assays, and methods of using the assays for diagnosis and prognosis, are
disclosed that involve multivariate analysis of the disclosed biomarkers and risk factors to
determine a combined score for an individual subject. The combined score can then be used to
determine the presence of HNSCC, or the risk of reoccurrence of HNSCC in a subject. In
particular, cut-off combined score values can be determined empirically by comparing positive
and negative control values.
        The biomarkers described herein include genes and proteins. Such biomarkers include
DNA comprising the entire or partial sequence of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the
biomarker, or the complement of such a sequence. The biomarker nucleic acids also include
                                                    7

    WO 2013/074793                                                            PCT/US2012/065282
RNA comprising the entire or partial sequence of any of the nucleic acid sequences of interest.
A biomarker protein is a protein encoded by or corresponding to a DNA biomarker of the
invention. A biomarker protein comprises the entire or partial amino acid sequence of any of the
biomarker proteins or polypeptides. Fragments and variants of biomarker genes and proteins are
also encompassed by the present invention. By "fragment" is intended a portion of the
polynucleotide or a portion of the amino acid sequence and hence protein encoded thereby.
Polynucleotides that are fragments of a biomarker nucleotide sequence generally comprise at
least 10, 15, 20, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 800,
900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200, 1,300, or 1,400 contiguous nucleotides, or up to the number of
nucleotides present in a full-length biomarker polynucleotide disclosed herein. A fragment of a
biomarker polynucleotide will generally encode at least 15, 25, 30, 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250
contiguous amino acids, or up to the total number of amino acids present in a full-length
biomarker protein of the invention. "Variant" is intended to mean substantially similar
sequences. Generally, variants of a particular biomarker of the invention will have at least about
40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%,
96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity to that biomarker as determined by sequence
alignment programs.
        The biomarkers described herein are genes and proteins whose overexpression correlates
with cancer, particularly HNSCC, prognosis. In particular embodiments, selective
overexpression of a biomarker or combination of biomarkers of interest in a patient sample is
indicative of a poor cancer prognosis. By "indicative of a poor prognosis" is intended that
overexpression of the particular biomarker or combination of biomarkers is associated with an
increased likelihood of relapse or recurrence of the underlying cancer or tumor, metastasis, or
death, as defined herein above. For example, "indicative of a poor prognosis" may refer to an
increased likelihood of relapse or recurrence of the underlying cancer or tumor, metastasis, or
death within five years, more particularly ten years. Biomarkers that are indicative of a poor
prognosis may be referred to herein as "bad outcome biomarkers." In other embodiments, the
absence of overexpression of a biomarker or combination of biomarkers of interest is indicative
of a good prognosis. As used herein, "indicative of a good prognosis" refers to an increased
likelihood that the patient will remain cancer-free, as defined herein above. In some
embodiments, "indicative of a good prognosis" refers to an increased likelihood that the patient
will remain cancer-free for at least five, more particularly at least ten years. Such biomarkers
may be referred to as "good outcome biomarkers."

        The disclosed biomarkers include genes and/or proteins whose overexpression (compared
to a control) correlates with HNSCC prognosis. A gene or protein can be overexpressed by 10%,
20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%, or greater as
compared to a control. Biomarkers include genes and proteins that are indicative of a poor
HNSCC prognosis (i.e., bad outcome biomarkers) as well as those that are indicative of a good
prognosis (i.e., good outcome biomarkers). Biomarkers of particular interest include genes and
proteins that are involved in regulation of cell growth and proliferation, cell cycle control, DNA
replication and transcription, apoptosis, signal transduction, angiogenesis/lymphogenesis, or
metastasis. In some embodiments, the biomarkers regulate protease systems involved in tissue
remodeling, extracellular matrix degradation, and adjacent tissue invasion. Other biomarkers
include regulators of gene expression such as hypermethylation or microRNA. Although any
biomarker whose expression pattern is indicative of HNSCC prognosis can be used to practice
the disclosed methods and assays, in particular embodiments, biomarkers are selected from the
group consisting of HPV, total protein, and CD44. In one embodiment, the CD44 biomarker is
solCD44.
        HPV infection can be determined by measuring HPV directly or indirectly. Three
categories of molecular assays are currently available for detection of HPV infection in tissue
and exfoliated cell samples. All are based on detection of HPV DNA and include: (1) non
amplified hybridization assays (Southern transfer hybridization, (STH), dot blot hybridization
(DB) and in situ hybridization (ISH)); (2) Signal amplified hybridization assays such as hybrid
capture assays; and (3) Target amplification assays, such as PCR and in situ PCR. Southern blot
hybridization requires large amounts of DNA, is laborious, and is not reproducible, while in situ
hybridization has only moderate sensitivity for HPV. PCR-based detection of HPV is both
extremely sensitive and specific. Using this approach, the viral DNA is amplified in vitro by
DNA polymerase to generate adequate amount of target, which is then either directly visualized
on gels, or (the more specific approach) detected by specific probe using traditional
hybridization methods. In practice, the sensitivity of PCR based method is about 10-100 HPV
viral genomes in a background of 100 ng cellular DNA. Since PCR can be performed on very
small amounts of DNA (10-100 ng), it is ideal for use on specimens with low DNA content.
         Currently, the only available FDA approved HPV detection method is the Hybrid capture
II assay (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). In this assay HPV DNAs are hybridized to RNA probes, and
RNA-DNA hybrids are captured and detected by a chemiluminescent system. The sensitivity of
this assay is similar to that of PCR based assays, with high sensitivity being achieved by signal,
rather than target amplification. The current HC II assay has the sensitivity to detect 1pg HPV
                                                   9

    WO 2013/074793                                                            PCT/US2012/065282
(about 50,000 copies) per ml sample. Proper sample collection is essential to achieve maximal
sensitivity, and a brush-sampling device has been shown to be optimal. The HC II assay contains
synthetic RNA probes complementary to the genomic sequence of 13 high-risk (types 16, 18, 31,
33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) and 5 low-risk (6, 11, 42, 43, 44) HPV types.
        Alternatively, HPV infection may be determined be detecting viral mRNA transcripts or
through detection of the cellular protein p16. For HPV to cause cancer, persistent infection and a
cellular environment that allows for high level expression of viral oncogenes E6 and E7 (initially
in the basal cell layer and then throughout the epithelium) is necessary. Therefore, detection of
E6/E7 mRNA may identify more clinically significant infection than a DNA approach.
                                                                 Ink4A
         Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, (CDKN2A, p16            , p16) is a cellular correlate of
the increased expression of oncogenic E6/E7 mRNA. The main actions of the HPV oncogenes
are the degradation of p53 by E6 and thereby the abrogation of apoptosis as well as the release of
E2F from pRb that leads to continuous activation of the cell cycle. Physiologically, E2F
activation is mediated by phosphorylation of the Rb protein. This pathway is strictly regulated by
a set of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors, among them p 1 6, that block enzymes
phosphorylating pRB (cyclin dependent kinases). In cells with transforming HPV infections, the
regulation of the Rb-E2F pathway is disturbed by E7 and the activation of p16 has no
downstream effect. As a result, p16 is strongly overexpressed and accumulates in the cells. p16
overexpression has been demonstrated in the vast majority of cervical precancers and cancers
while in normal tissue, p16 expression is found only rarely.
        Epigenetic effects of HPV infection may also be used to detect HPV. Differentially
methylated loci between HPV and HPV- HNSCC cell lines are described in Sartor MA, et al.
Epigenetics 6(6):777-87 (2011), which is incorporated by reference for these epigenetic profiles.
        Therefore, HPV infection can be detected using antibodies that specifically bind p 1 6INK4 a
Alternatively, HPV infection can be determined by detecting HPV DNA, RNA, or protein.
Likewise, HPV infection can be determined by detecting viral oncogenes (e.g., E6/E7) or
epigenetic changes.
        Methods
        Disclosed are methods for diagnosing HNSCC in a subject, staging an HNSCC tumor in
a subject, monitoring efficacy of an HNSCC treatment, or determining the prognosis of a subject
diagnosed with HNSCC, or predicting recurrence of HNSCC in a subject. These methods each
comprise assaying a body sample from the subject for the presence of total protein, solCD44, and
HPV. The combination of total protein, HPV, and CD44 levels may be used in a multivariate
analysis to determine a combined score. The method may further comprise assaying the body
                                                  10

    WO 2013/074793                                                            PCT/US2012/065282
sample for the presence of hyaluronic acid (HA), hyaluronidase (HAase), IL-8, or a combination
thereof. HNSCC risk factors and/or demographic factors may also be used in combination with
total protein, solCD44, and HPV detection to improve sensitivity and/or accuracy of the
disclosed method.
         Multivariate analysis is based on the statistical principle of multivariate statistics, which
involves observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time. For
example, there are several regression methods that can be used with multivariate analysis,
including, but not limited to generalized linear and nonlinear regressions, logistic and Poisson
regressions, supervised machine learning algorithms, neural networks, support vector machines,
response surface modeling, and multivariate adaptive regression splines. In some embodiments,
logisitic regression is used.
         For example, the multivariate analysis can first involve determining how total protein,
solCD44, and p16 levels change based on risk variables such as race, gender, smoking and
alcohol use. Mathematical models may then be developed whose terms include biomarker levels
and the risk variables to predict the probability of cancer. The statistical significance associated
with the terms reflect their importance for prediction. A mathematical model may then be used to
estimate a predictive score, which allows one to develop an overall probability score of cancer.
For example, after having investigated how the marker levels and risk variables (e.g., race,
gender, smoking and alcohol use) are associated with the outcome, including interactions, a
fitted model can be obtained relating the log-odds of biomarkers and covariates. Based on this
model, a score or a predictive probability for having cancer can be estimate at specified values of
all variable included in the model.
         In some embodiments, an increase in combined (predictive) score above a cut-off point
distinguishes subjects with HNSCC from those without HNSCC or at low risk of future
occurrence thereof. In some embodiments, an increase in combined score above a cut-off point
identifies HNSCC tumor stage, predicts effectiveness of an HNSCC treatment, predicts
prognosis of a subject diagnosed with HNSCC, or predicts the risk of HNSCC recurrence. For
example, an increase in score above a cut-off point may be associated with a poor prognosis or
likelihood of recurrence.
         The disclosed assays and methods may be used to guide therapeutic treatment of a
subject with HNSCC or at risk of developing HNSCC. For example, a subject with a low
combined score may be given a single modality treatment such as surgery or radiation alone
rather than combined therapy. This would result in decreased treatment-related morbidity. In
contrast, a subject with a high combined score may be offered more aggressive treatments, such
                                                   11

    WO 2013/074793                                                           PCT/US2012/065282
as surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, since higher treatment-related morbidity would be
warranted given the higher risk of death from the disease. Therefore, the disclosed methods may
further comprise treating a subject diagnosed with HNSCC or determined to have a poor
HNSCC prognosis, with surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy,
targeted therapy, or any combination thereof.
        Each of the disclosed biomarkers can be detected in a subject using body samples. By
"body sample" is intended any sampling of cells, tissues, or bodily fluids in which expression of
a biomarker can be detected. Examples of such body samples include but are not limited to
blood, lymph, urine, gynecological fluids, biopsies, and smears. Bodily fluids useful in the
present invention include blood, urine, saliva, nipple aspirates, lavages or any other bodily
secretion or derivative thereof. Blood can include whole blood, plasma, serum, or any derivative
of blood. In preferred embodiments, the body sample comprises oral rinses. Methods for
collecting various body samples are well known in the art.
        The methods are useful in detecting individuals at risk for head and neck cancer,
including, for example, smokers, alcohol abusers, and subjects exposed to HPV virus. The
methods described herein also permit the enhanced assessment of HNSCC prognosis in
comparison to analysis of other known prognostic indicators. In particular aspects, the
sensitivity and specificity is equal to or greater than that of known cancer prognostic evaluation
methods. The endpoint for assessing specificity and sensitivity is comparison of the prognosis or
outcome predicted using the methods of the invention (i.e., at or near the time of diagnosis) with
the actual clinical outcome (i.e., whether the patient remained cancer-free or suffered a
recurrence within a specified time period). As used herein, "specificity" refers to the level at
which a method of the invention can accurately identify true negatives. In a clinical study,
specificity is calculated by dividing the number of true negatives by the sum of true negatives
and false positives. By "sensitivity" is intended the level at which a method of the invention can
accurately identify samples that are true positives. Sensitivity is calculated in a clinical study by
dividing the number of true positives by the sum of true positives and false negatives. In some
embodiments, the sensitivity of the disclosed methods for the evaluation of HNSCC is at least
about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%,
95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more. Furthermore, the specificity of the present methods is
preferably at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%,
92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more. In further embodiments, the combined
sensitivity and specificity value for the prognostic methods of the invention is assessed. By
"combined sensitivity and specificity value" is intended the sum of the individual specificity and
                                                    12

    WO 2013/074793                                                         PCT/US2012/065282
sensitivity values, as defined herein above. The combined sensitivity and specificity value of the
present methods is preferably at least about 105%, 110%, 115%, 120%, 130%, 140%, 150%,
160% or more.
        As used herein, the definitions of "true" and "false" positives and negatives will be
dependent upon whether the biomarker or combination of biomarkers under consideration are
good outcome or bad outcome biomarkers. That is, in the case of good outcome biomarkers (i.e.,
those indicative of a good prognosis), "true positive" refers to those samples exhibiting
overexpression of the biomarker of interest, as determined by a physical exam followed by
biopsy. A positive biopsy on pathology can indicate whether a sample is positive or negative.
        As described above, in some embodiments, two or more biomarkers are used, more
preferably, two or more complementary biomarkers. By "complementary" is intended that
detection of the combination of biomarkers in a body sample results in the accurate
determination of cancer prognosis in a greater percentage of cases than would be identified if
only one of the biomarkers was used. Thus, in some cases, a more accurate determination of
cancer prognosis can be made by using at least two of the disclosed biomarkers.
        Any methods available in the art for detecting expression of biomarkers are encompassed
herein. The expression of a biomarker of the invention can be detected on a nucleic acid level or
a protein level. By "detecting expression" is intended determining the quantity or presence of a
biomarker gene or protein. Thus, "detecting expression" encompasses instances where a
biomarker is determined not to be expressed, not to be detectably expressed, expressed at a low
level, expressed at a normal level, or overexpressed. In order to determine overexpression, the
body sample to be examined can be compared with a corresponding sample. For example, a
corresponding body sample that originates from a healthy person. That is, the "normal" level of
expression is the level of expression of the biomarker in, for example, a sample from a human
subject or patient not afflicted with HNSCC. The body sample can also be compared with a
corresponding body sample from a subject treated for HNSCC. Such a sample can be present in
standardized form. In some embodiments, determination of biomarker overexpression requires
no comparison between the body sample and a corresponding body sample that originates from a
healthy person. For example, detection of overexpression of a biomarker indicative of a poor
prognosis in a tumor sample may preclude the need for comparison to a corresponding sample
that originates from a healthy person. Moreover, in some aspects of the invention, no
expression, underexpression, or normal expression (i.e., the absence of overexpression) of a
biomarker or combination of biomarkers of interest provides useful information regarding the
prognosis of a patient.

    WO 2013/074793                                                             PCT/US2012/065282
         Methods for detecting expression of the biomarkers of the invention comprise any
methods that determine the quantity or the presence of the biomarkers either at the nucleic acid
or protein level. Such methods are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to,
lateral flow "test strips," western blots, northern blots, southern blots, ELISA,
immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, nucleic acid
hybridization techniques, nucleic acid reverse transcription methods, and nucleic acid
amplification methods, for example, PCR. In particular embodiments, expression of a biomarker
is detected on a protein level using, for example, antibodies that are directed against specific
biomarker proteins. These antibodies can be used in various methods such as Western blot,
ELISA, immunoprecipitation, or immunohistochemistry techniques. Likewise, immunostaining
of tissue can be combined with assessment of clinical information, conventional prognostic
methods, and expression of molecular markers (e.g., p16 INK4a and solCD44) known in the art. In
this manner, the disclosed methods can permit the more accurate determination of HNSCC
prognosis.
         Kits
         Also provided herein are kits for diagnosing a subject with HNSCC or determining the
                                                                                          INK4a
prognosis of a subject with HNSCC. The kit can include means for measuring p16
solCD44, and/or total protein. For example, the kit can include a plurality of antibodies that
specifically bind p16           In some embodiments, the antibody comprises the idiotype of the
                              .4a.
E6H4 antibody clone. The kit can further include a detection agent (e.g., secondary antibodies
and/or colorimetric agent) for detecting the contained antibodies. The kit can further include a
plurality of antibodies that specifically bind CD44 (e.g., solCD44). The kit can further include a
reagent for determining total protein concentration in a sample. The kit can also include a
reference sample of p16     INK4a  and/or solCD44. The kit can additionally include directions for use
of the kit (e.g., instructions for diagnosing a subject), a container, and/or a carrier. In particular,
the kit can contain a computer readable medium or a hyperlink that uses algorithms and
reference tables to convert detection values into a combined score. In some embodiments, the kit
is a lateral flow immunoassay. Alternatively, the kit can comprise a multi-well plate, optionally
coated with the antibody that specifically binds p16    INK4a , the antibody that specifically binds
CD44, or a combination thereof

                                             EXAMPLES
        The following examples are set forth below to illustrate the methods and results
according to the disclosed subject matter. These examples are not intended to be inclusive of all
aspects of the subject matter disclosed herein, but rather to illustrate representative methods and
results. These examples are not intended to exclude equivalents and variations of the present
invention which are apparent to one skilled in the art.
        Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers (e.g., amounts,
temperature, etc.) but some errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated
otherwise, parts are parts by weight, temperature is in 'C or is at ambient temperature, and
pressure is at or near atmospheric. There are numerous variations and combinations of reaction
conditions, e.g., component concentrations, temperatures, pressures and other reaction ranges
and conditions that can be used to optimize the product purity and yield obtained from the
described process. Only reasonable and routine experimentation will be required to optimize
such process conditions.
Example 1:
        The relationship between the test described herein and HPV-related HNSCC was studied
by looking at how the markers described herein improve in patients whose tumors are positive
for p16 INK4a. Fourteen oropharyngeal cancer subjects were evaluated. For each subject, the p16
INK4a immunohistochemistry results from their tumor tissue and
                                                                    solCD44 and protein results from
their oral rinses were obtained. Mean levels of solCD44 and protein level were lower in HPV
cases (CD44: 3.17 vs. 4.2, p=0.55, protein: 0.83 vs.1.07, p=0.49) though differences did not
reach statistical significance. The solCD44 and protein tests that were measured using the
supernatants from oral rinses were combined with p16 INK4a levels detected using the pellets from
the same oral rinses.
        An in vitro assay was performed for the quantitative determination of human p16INK4a
protein in lysed samples from the oral rinse pellets. Sample pellets were placed in 200 tL of cell
lysis buffer (SIGMA) containing protease inhibitor (Thermo Scientific) for stabilization of
solubilized p 1 6 INK 4 a. Then samples were heated at 95'C for 10 minutes, which facilitates
complete lysis of cells for better detection of p16 INK4a. The p16INK4a protein was quantified using
a colorimetric ELISA sandwich technique using microtiter strips coated with the p 1 6INK 4 a_
                                                                                            INK4a
specific, monoclonal antibody E6H4TM (Roche mtm laboratories AG) and a second p16Ia
specific, monoclonal antibody labeled with HRP. Quantitation was performed by generating a
standard curve based on known p 1 6 INK 4 a levels (Standards 1-6). The levels in test samples were
determined by interpolation based on the standard curve. A microtiter plate reader was used to
                                                   15

    WO 2013/074793                                                             PCT/US2012/065282
measure absorbance in each well at a wavelength of 450 nm (reference wavelength: 620 nm). A
calculation program based on the 4-parameter method was used to obtain the final p16INK4a
sample concentrations. The results are stated in U/mL and study samples were measured in
duplicates, each with a volume of 100 tL. A cut-off value of 15 U/mL was verified as the
appropriate threshold to classify an individual clinical specimen as positive for the CervatecTM
p16INK4a ELISA (Roche mtm laboratories AG) result by a multicenter clinical study (Protocol
#9502-06-REG-DE-001).
         Using this combined method, p16 INK4a in combination with CD44 and protein was tested
in 14 HNSCC patients including patients with oral cavity or oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (CA) or unknown primary carcinomas (UKI CA). Three healthy volunteers (HV)
were also tested (see Table 1). Two patients with low levels of CD44 (cut-off set at 2.7 ng/ml)
and protein (cut-off set at 1.0 mg/ml) had p16 INK4a levels above the cut-off of 15 U/ml. CD44
and protein also each identified tumors that were not detected by the other tests. Thus, the
addition of p16 INK4a to the panel improves sensitivity. The 3 healthy volunteers that were tested
all had levels for each marker below the cut-offs.

Example 3:
         There is a tremendous need for a simple, inexpensive, noninvasive early detection test for
HNSCC. Prior efforts have focused on CD44, a transmembrane glycoprotein that is emerging as
a critical HNSCC tumor initiation marker. When SCC-25 cells (CD44 low) were transfected
with CD44 standard form, it was shown that overexpression of CD44 resulted in increased
                                                       20

    WO 2013/074793                                                           PCT/US2012/065282
proliferation, migration and cisplatin resistance (Figures 3A, 3B, 3C). In addition, knock-down
of CD44 using the CD44 and EGFR high cell line CAL27 results in greatly diminished tumor
growth in nude mice (Figure 4A, 2B) (P<0.05). CD44 interacts has been shown to interact with
key tyrosine kinases such as EGFR (the target for cetuximab therapy) to induce growth and
migration. The disclosed data in Figure 5 shows that total EGFR and its phosphorylated form
(Y1068) are reduced on CD44-siRNA xenografts indicating that the two molecules are
functionally related.
         Because of the critical need for an early detection test and knowledge that CD44 could be
cleaved to a soluble form, solCD44 was evaluated in oral rinses from cancer patients and
controls. In a pilot study including 26 HNSCC patients and 10 healthy volunteers, it was shown
that solCD44 could be detected in oral rinses and could distinguish patients with invasive disease
from normal volunteers with a sensitivity of 79% and 100% specificity. To determine whether
this test would work in a higher risk population, a control cohort with a history of tobacco
and/or alcohol use and benign disease of the head and neck was developed. In this study with
102 HNSCC and 69 controls, the solCD44 ELISA test was shown to have a sensitivity of 62%
and specificity of 88% and benign disease was shown not to significantly impact results. Levels
of the markers were determined to be lower in subjects with laryngeal/ hypopharyngeal tumors
which are less frequent and located more distally in the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT).
         To improve sensitivity, additional markers were examined. Total protein, measured by a
simple Lowry-like assay and originally used as a normalizer for hydration status, was found to
be elevated in HNSCC compared to controls. When the same cohort were evaluated, it was
shown for the first time that solCD44 and total protein levels combined, are more effective at
distinguishing HNSCC from controls than either marker alone. More recent work in a cohort of
39 controls and 40 cases demonstrated that including other risk variables such as teeth loss and
education improves the test, resulting in an area under the curve (AUC) for the multivariate
analysis of 0.85.

         This study used a case-control design to evaluate soluble markers for HNSCC in 150
oropharyngeal and oral cavity HNSCC patients and 150 controls frequency matched for
important variables. Table 7 shows an interim analysis of solCD44, log2 SolCD44 and total
protein levels in 132 cases and 124 controls. Cases and controls were successfully frequency
matched for age, gender, race and ethnicity (p> 0.5). Both solCD44 and total protein levels are
significantly elevated. The logistic models in Table 8 are all adjusted for age. The test detected
oral cancer best in black males. For black females, the sample size was smaller. There was no
significant effect of markers either individually or together, however the corresponding odds
ratios were in the same direction as black males. Among white males, the effect of log2 CD44
was significant by itself or when protein was added. There was a slight improvement for model 3
compared to model 1. Finally, among white females, the markers were least effective, with
AUCs near 0.60. Since the marker test worked best in black men, a group where HPV infection
is less common, HPV expression was examined in the oral cancer cases.
         Thirty-seven cases were identified with available FFPE tissue. Except for one patient
with follow-up of 13.9 months, all remaining 20 alive patients had follow up in the range 27 to
54.4 months (median 37 months). Fourteen out of 16 deaths occurred within the first 2 years of
follow-up. solCD44 and total protein levels were evaluated in oral rinses, and various staining
patterns of CD44, EGFR and p16 (as a surrogate for HPV infection) were examined using IHC.
Associations with progression-free and overall survival were also determined. Important
demographic and risk factor behaviors such as gender, race, ethnicity, tobacco and alcohol use
were also evaluated. This cohort had the following demographics: mean age was 60.4 years,
16.2% were female, 59.5% were Hispanic, 21.6% were black, 64.9% were current smokers, 50%
were heavy drinkers, 57.1 % had income less than $10,000 per year. The group's disease
characteristics were as follows: 35.10%were oral cavity (OC) and the remainder were

    WO 2013/074793                                                          PCT/US2012/065282
oropharyngeal cancers (OP); only 32.4% of subjects were stage III or lower; patients were
treated with chemoradiotherapy (43.2 %), surgery and chemoradiotherapy (24.3%), surgery
alone (13.5%), surgery plus radiation (5.4%), surgery and chemotherapy (2.7%), chemotherapy
alone (2.7%) and nothing or the data was missing (5.4%). Nearly 57% recurred or progressed
and 43.2% died.
        Forty-four percent of tumors were p16m as defined by 50% or more of the tumor cells
staining positive for p16. Comparison of IHC patterns revealed that positive p16 staining, lack of
CD44 membrane staining, lack of EGFR membrane and cytoplasmic staining pattern, and
nonkeratinizing tumors were significantly associated with OP compared to OC tumors. There
were no differences in staging or outcomes by tumor site. With respect to location of staining,
p16 positivity was significantly associated with nuclear or nuclear and cytoplasmic p16 staining
(p<0001) as opposed to only cytoplasmic staining or no staining. Similarly lack of universal
CD44 membrane staining (p<0.0001) was associated with p16 positivity. Lack of universal
EGFR membrane and cytoplasmic staining in the p16 positive tumors also reached statistical
significance (p=0.0 2 ). Keratinization, gender, ethnicity, race, smoking and alcohol use were not
significantly related to p16 positivity in this study.
        SolCD44 and total protein oral rinse levels showed no significant differences based on
p16 status whether the definition of p16- as 1) 50% or more tumor cells p16m or 2) any nuclear
p16 staining as opposed to only cytoplasmic/ no staining was used . However, for both solCD44
and total protein, significantly higher levels were associated with recurrence or progression
(CD44:10.8 vs. 4.3 p=0.043, protein 1.2 vs. 0.8 p=O.030). Based on Kaplan-Meier , logrank test,
and Cox regression analysis, significant predictors of progression free survival were CD44 (>10
v. < 10, HR=3.18 p=0.01 1), protein (>1 v. <1, HR=3.24, p=0.009), T stage (T4 v. TI-III, HR=
2.99, p<0.049), race (Black v. White, HR=5.43, p<0.0001) and ethnicity (non-Hispanic vs.
Hispanics, HR=3.00, p<0.014). Gender almost reached significance (female v. male, HR=2.39,
p<0.072). Similarly significant predictors of overall survival were CD44>10 (HR=4.60,
p=0.005), Protein 1 (HR=3.38, p=O.17), T4 stage (HR= 2.97, p=0.035), Black race (HR=6.53,
p<O.001) and Non-Hispanic ethnicity (HR= 4.01, p=O.008). The following variables showed no
significance as a predictor of progression-free survival and of overall survival: p16 status, CD44
staining pattern, EGFR staining pattern, keratinization, smoking history, alcohol history, site
(oral cavity vs. oropharynx), node status, and age. Furthermore, CD44 and protein retained
magnitude of effect and significance in bivariate analysis including disease stage.
        In this group of HNSCC, only 5 subjects were never smokers; of these, 4 were HPV. Of
the HPV+ never smokers all were alive and 1 recurred. Thus the lack of association between p16
                                                   23

status and prognosis may be due to the few never smokers in the study as several studies show
that HPV+ nonsmokers have a markedly better prognosis compared to HPV+ smokers.
        To further investigate the significant associations between p16, CD44, and EGFR
localization, immunofluorescence staining was performed. Figure 6 shows typical p16- IHC
staining where staining is cytoplasmic and diffuse. In this case, CD44 stains in the membrane
and universally throughout the tumor. CD44 and EGFR colocalize on the cell membrane and
there is some cytoplasmic staining of EGFR as well.
        However, when tumors are p 16, as shown in Figure 7, the nuclei stain strongly for p16
and there is some cytoplasmic staining as well. However, CD44 membrane staining is lost, only
the invading lymphocytes retain CD44 expression. EGFR expression is not seen at all.
