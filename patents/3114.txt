                                          BACKGROUND
              Many potential lignocellulosic feedstocks are available today, including
     agricultural residues, woody biomass, municipal waste, oilseeds/cakes and seaweed, to
 20  name a few. At present, these materials are often under-utilized, being used, for
     example, as animal feed, biocompost materials, burned in a co-generation facility or even
     landfilled.
              Lignocellulosic biomass includes crystalline cellulose fibrils embedded in a
     hemicellulose matrix, surrounded by lignin. This produces a compact matrix that is
 25  difficult to access by enzymes and other chemical, biochemical and/or biological
     processes. Cellulosic biomass materials (e.g., biomass material from which the lignin
     has been removed) is more accessible to enzymes and other conversion processes, but
                                                   1

WO 2014/138535                                                               PCT/US2014/021584
     even so, naturally-occurring cellulosic materials often have low yields (relative to
     theoretical yields) when contacted with hydrolyzing enzymes. Lignocellulosic biomass
     is even more recalcitrant to enzyme attack. Furthermore, each type of lignocellulosic
     biomass has its own specific composition of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.

                                                   SUMMARY
              In general, the filtering of materials, e.g., biomass materials are disclosed herein.
     Processes are disclosed herein for saccharifying or liquifying a biomass material, e.g.,
 10  cellulosic, lignocellulosic and/or starchy feedstocks, by converting biomass material to
     low molecular weight sugars, e.g., saccharifying the feedstock, e.g., using an enzyme,
     e.g., one or more cellulase and/or amylase. The invention also relates to converting a
     feedstock to a product, e.g., by bioprocessing, such as fermentation or other processing,
     such as hydrogenation or esterification. The processes include utilizing filtration to
 15  remove solids before, during or after saccharification and/or fermentation. The solids
     can then be, for example, used for energy cogeneration, used as a fermentation additive
     (e.g., nutrient), or used as another feed material.
              Methods, such as the saccharification of biomass to produce sugars, produce
     liquids that can be viscous due to various oligomers and the high loading of solids. In
 20  order to further process the materials, e.g., sugars or the solids in the slurries themselves,
     it is often advantageous to separate the liquids from the solids. Methods that involve
     dilution (e.g., with water) can be utilized to aid in processing, but these methods can
     incur a downstream cost associated with the removal of added diluents. Some of the
     methods described herein allow for the filtration of these highly loaded and viscous feed
 25  streams without clogging and/or without significant dilution.
              Generally the invention features systems and methods for separating solids from
     liquids of a slurry (e.g., containing solids and dissolved solids suspended in a liquid)
     including applying a saccharified biomass material slurry to a surface (e.g., to an outer
     portion) of a filter device. Optionally, a vibratory screener can be utilized to remove
 30  some of the solids prior to applying the saccharified material to the surface (e.g., outer
     portion) of the filter device. For example, the filter device can be a rotary drum filter
                                                      2

WO 2014/138535                                                              PCT/US2014/021584
     device (e.g., a rotary vacuum drum filter device). Optionally the saccharified biomass
     material slurry comprises saccharified sugars, such as sugars selected from the group
     consisting of glucose, xylose and mixtures of these. For example, the sugars can be
     dissolved in and/or suspended in a solvent, such as water and/or a non-aqueous solvent.
  5  The saccharified material can also include cells, such as cells selected from the group
     consisting of yeast cells, bacterial cells, fungal cells and mixture of these cells.
     Optionally the saccharified material can include protein material, such as enzyme
     material, denatured protein material, peptides, peptide residues, amino acids and/or
     denatured enzyme material. The saccharified material can include an acid (e.g., lactic
 10  acid, butyric acid and/or acetic acid) and/or an alcohol (e.g., ethanol and/or butanol). The
     saccharified material can include fermentation products. In some instances, the
     saccharified material is devoid of one or more soluble sugars from which the biomass is
     composed. For example, the saccharified material can be devoid of, glucose and/or
     xylose, such where the sugar has be removed by any means (e.g., selective fermentation
 15  of one or more of the sugars, chemical separation and removal of one or more of the
     sugars).
              In some implementations, the biomass has been saccharified using one or more
     saccharification agents. Optionally, the saccharification agent is selected from the group
     consisting of enzymes, acids, bases, oxidants and mixtures of these. Optionally, the
 20  selected saccharification agents can be combined in any order to saccharify the biomass,
     for example, the biomass can be treated with an acid and then with an enzyme, or with an
     oxidant and then with an enzyme. In some implementations, the saccharification agent
     includes sulfuric acid and an enzyme. Optionally or additionally, the saccharification
     agent is a cellulolytic enzyme.
 25           In some implementations, the biomass has been treated to reduce its recalcitrance
     prior to saccharification. For example, the recalcitrance of the biomass can be reduced
     relative to biomass (e.g., biomass feedstock) in its native state prior to saccharification.
     In some instances, reducing the recalcitrance of the feedstock includes treating the
     feedstock with a physical treatment. The treatment can include, for example, irradiation
 30  (e.g., electron beam radiation), sonication, pyrolysis, oxidation, steam explosion,
                                                     3

WO 2014/138535                                                              PCT/US2014/021584
     chemical treatment, mechanical treatment and combinations of these treatments. The
     treatment can include the application of any one or more of the treatments disclosed
     herein, applied alone or in any desired combination, and applied once or multiple times.
              Optionally, the methods described herein utilize a filter device e.g., a rotary drum
  5  filter device, that includes a rotatable drum having a filter face through which liquid of
     the saccharified material (e.g., liquids of the slurry) can pass, while retaining solids of
     the saccharified material thereon. The filter face can have a filter aid extending
     outwardly therefrom. Optionally the filter aid covers substantially the entire filter face of
     the rotatable drum. The filter aid can include, for example, a filter aid selected from the
 10  group consisting of diatomaceous earth, celite, silica, pumice, perlite, alumina, zeolites,
     sand, cellulosic material, (e.g. SOLKA-FLOC@, International Fiber Corporation, North
     Tonawanda, NY) lignocellulosic material, and mixtures of these. Optionally, the filter
     aid extends from the filter face a distance of from about 0.5 mm to about 250 mm, such
     as between about 1 mm and about 100 mm or about 1 mm to about 50 mm or between
 15  about 2 mm to about 25 mm. The rotatable drum includes an inner portion wherein the
     inner portion is maintained at a lower pressure than the filter face. For example, the
     pressure difference between the inner portion and the filter face can be maintained
     between about 20 and about 25 inches of Hg while separating solids from liquids in the
     slurry (e.g., the saccharified biomass). Optionally, the inner portion of the drum is in
 20  communication with a vacuum pump and/or a vacuum source, e.g., for maintaining the
     pressure as described above. Optionally, the filter face of the filter device includes a
     filter cloth such as a woven cloth, e.g., having a weave selected from the group
     consisting of a twill weave, a plain weave, a satin weave, a knot weave, a basket weave,
     an oxford weave and combinations of these. Optionally, the filter cloth has a porosity
 25  rating ranging from about I to 100 CFM/ft 2 (e.g., about 1-3, about 1-10, about 10-30,
     about 15-20, about 30-50, about 30-40, about 50 to 70). Optionally, the filter device
     includes a knife for continuously removing the solids deposited on the drum face as the
     drum is rotated relative to the knife. For example, the knife moves in a direction
     perpendicularly towards the drum face at a rate adjusted to continuously removes an
 30  interfacial region comprising the solids of the saccharified material and the filter aid. The
     rate, for example, can be adjusted to maintain a preset pressure difference between the
                                                    4

WO 2014/138535                                                              PCT/US2014/021584
     inner and outer portions of the drum. Filtering biomass materials that have been
     processed, e.g., saccharified and/or fermented, can be challenging and slow. The
     processed biomass includes particles of various sizes and shapes (e.g., fibers, granular
     particles, micro-particles, nano-particles, colloids and larger particles), polymers (e.g.,
  5  enzymes, proteins, polysaccharides, lignin), live and/or dead cells (e.g., from yeast,
     bacteria or fungi used to process the biomass), and small molecules (e.g., amino acids,
     monomeric sugars, organic acids, alcohols). The biomass filtering systems described
     herein generally resist clogging and allow for clarification of even the thickest biomass
     slurries.
 10           Implementations of the invention can optionally include one or more of the
     following summarized features. In some implementations, the selected features can be
     applied or utilized in any order while in other implementations a specific selected
     sequence is applied or utilized. Individual features can be applied or utilized more than
     once in any sequence and even continuously. In addition, an entire sequence, or a portion
 15  of a sequence, of applied or utilized features can be applied or utilized once, repeatedly
     or continuously in any order. In some optional implementations, the features can be
     applied or utilized with different, or where applicable the same, set or varied, quantitative
     or qualitative parameters as determined by a person skilled in the art. For example,
     parameters of the features such as size, individual dimensions (e.g., length, width,
 20  height), location of, degree (e.g., to what extent such as the degree of recalcitrance),
     duration, frequency of use, density, concentration, intensity and speed can be varied or

                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
              Using the methods described herein, biomass (e.g., plant biomass, animal
     biomass, paper, and municipal waste biomass) can be processed to produce useful
  5  intermediates and products such as organic acids, salts of organic acids, anhydrides,
     esters of organic acids and fuels, e.g., fuels for internal combustion engines or feedstocks
     for fuel cells.
              Many of the methods disclosed herein involve saccharification of biomass to
     produce sugars, and in some cases fermentation (or other bioprocessing or chemical
 10  transformations) of the resulting sugars to form other products and/or intermediates.
     After saccharification and/or fermentation (or other processing), it is often desirable to
     remove solids by a filtration process and in some cases to concentrate the liquid filtrate.
     The present disclosure pertains to techniques for accomplishing this filtration generally
     without clogging even with a thick (or highly loaded slurries).
 15           FIG. 1 shows an example of a rotary vacuum drum filtration (RVDF) system 10.
     RVDF system 10 includes a drum 12, the lower portion of which is positioned in a tank
     13. The interior of the drum is placed under vacuum, e.g., by communication with
     vacuum pump 34. A moisture trap or water air separator 32 may be provided to reduce
     moisture drawn into the vacuum pump. In some implementations, the drum includes
 20  channels that extend from the surface of the drum to a central hollow axis (not shown),
     and the outer surface of the drum is covered by a filter cloth (also not shown). The filter
     cloth, when the drum is in use, forms the outer surface of drum 12. Some details of the
     filter cloth will be discussed below, referring to FIG. 2, after some more details of FIG. 1
     are discussed.
 25           Due to the porosity of the filter cloth and the underlying channels in the surface
     of the drum, the vacuum drawn on the interior of the drum is applied to a material on the
     surface of the filter cloth. Tank 13 has an inlet 14 through which filter aid, slurry or
     saccharified material can be fed. In some embodiments there can be separate inlets for
     the filter aid and saccharified material. The filter aid slurry or saccharified material can

     containers can be, for example, a drum, a tank, a fermenter, or a saccharifier e.g., that is

WO 2014/138535                                                              PCT/US2014/021584
     100 - 150,000 gal in volume, such as 10,000 - 75,000 gal (described below). The
     container for the filter aid can include an agitator, such as a mixer equipped with a
     mixing propeller to aid in suspending the filter aid in the liquid phase (water). The
     container for the saccharified material and tank 13 can also include an agitator. Tank 13
  5  is fed by a pump (e.g., positive displacement pump) or by gravity. The tank also
     includes an overflow outlet 16 through which material can exit the tank in case of
     overfilling.
              When in use for filtering biomass material, such as a saccharified material, the
     drum is preferably initially coated with a layer 17 of filter aid. The drum is coated by
 10  adding the filter aid slurry to tank 13 and rotating drum 12 at a constant rate through the
     slurry while placing the interior of the drum under vacuum, for example 10-15 inches
     Hg. Water is drawn through the filter cloth and the filter aid is deposited as a uniform
     layer on this cloth. The thickness of the layer of filter aid can be varied and optimized for
     the process of interest (e.g., depending on the concentration and composition of the
 15  saccharified material to be processed). For example a layer 17 of filter aid slurry having
     a thickness between about 0.1 and 30 inches can be used ( e.g., 0.5 and 20 inches, 1 and
     20 inches, 5 and 20 inches, 0.5 and 10, 0.5 to 5, 1 to 5, or 1 to 3 inches).
              The filter aid increases the surface area of the drum presented to the material to
     be filtered and improves the filtering ability and capacity of the RVDF, generally
 20  allowing more material and/or smaller particles to be filtered. Filter aids can include
     diatomaceous earth, such as celite, a glass, such as a silica glass, such as volcanic
     amorphous glass, such as perlite, a cellulosic or lignocellulosic material, silica, alumina,
     zeolite, sand or mixtures of any of these filter aids.
              Once the drum has been coated with filter aid, saccharified material 15 is added
 25  to tank 13. This can be done by first exchanging the filter aid with water and then adding
     the saccharified material, or by simply adding the saccharified material and inter-mixing
     it with the filter aid slurry which is slowly diluted and replaced as the liquids are drawn
     through the drum filter. Alternatively, filter aid can be continuously added and the filter
     aid kept at a low concentration in the saccharified material, which can increase the
 30  efficiency of the filtration but which also tends to increase the cost of filtration.

WO 2014/138535                                                             PCT/US2014/021584
              The vacuum drawn is typically increased when filtering saccharified material, for
     example to between 20 and 30 inches of Hg (e.g., between about 20 and 25 inches or
     between about 25 and 30 inches). It is preferable not to allow the surface of the drum
     with the filter aid and saccharified material to completely dry out, since this can lead to
  5  channel formation through the filter aid which may reduce filter efficiency. During use
     for filtering the saccharified material, the drum 12 is continuously rotated in the direction
     of arrow A, picking up a layer 18 of the saccharified material from the tank 13.
     Optionally, the filter drum is passed beneath one or more shower heads or bars 20, which
     spray a wash liquid (e.g., water) 22 onto the layer 18. The wash liquid aids in extracting
 10  out soluble material from the solids.
              The vacuum generated by vacuum pump 34 draws liquid out of the layer and into
     the inside of the drum 12 through the pores of the filter cloth. A filtrate receiver 30 is
     connected by a tube to a seal tank 26, which receives the filtrates (wash water and liquid
     and dilute solids from the saccharified material). A filtrate pump 31 is engaged to move
 15  the filtrates from the system to a collection tank or other receiving area (not shown). In
     an alternate embodiment, the filtrate receiver is directly connected to pump 31 and the
     seal tank 26 is not used.
              Vacuum pump 34 can be replaced by alternative vacuum sources. For example,
     an injector (e.g., steam injector, educator-jet pump) can be used.
 20           Between layers 17 and 18 there is an interfacial region 40, as shown in FIG. 1A.
     The interfacial region includes both saccharified material and filter aid. The interfacial
     region can include a concentration gradient of material, for example, perpendicular
     towards the drum surface, transitioning from substantially saccharified material solids to
     filter aid. Knife 28 removes a layer of solid from the surface of the drum, and in ideal
 25  operation, removes the saccharified material and the interfacial region. If the interfacial
     region is not removed, this interfacial region grows and can impede the flow of fluids
     through the filter drum. This impediment can cause foaming due to a pressure drop on
     the inside of the drum, or even complete blockage of the filtration. Thus, if the
     interfacial region and filter aid layer is not removed, the amount of material that can be
 30  filtered is reduced and filter aid material is wasted.

WO 2014/138535                                                               PCT/US2014/021584
             The knife 28 is slowly moved towards the drum at a rate to continuously remove
     the saccharified material and the interfacial region. The rate of movement of the knife
     can be adjusted manually or can be adjusted automatically, and may be based on, for
     example, the vacuum measured in the interior of the drum, or an optical detector directed
  5  at layers 17, 18 and/or 40. For example, if vacuum measurement is used to control the
     rate of knife movement, an optimal vacuum of 20-25 inches Hg can be maintained by
     increasing the knife speed if the vacuum rises above 25 inches Hg, and reducing the
     knife speed if the vacuum drops to below 20 inches of Hg. The solution of saccharified
     material that is filtered can have between about 1 and 90 wt.% suspended solids (e.g.,
 10  between about 1 and 80 wt.%, between about 1 and 70 wt.%, between about 1 and 60
     wt.%, between about 1 and 50 wt.%, between about 1 and 40 wt.%, between about 1 and
     30 wt.%, between about 1 and 20 wt.%, between about 5 and 80 wt.%, between about 5
     and 60 wt.%, between about 5 and 40 wt.%, between about 5 and 20 wt.%, between
     about 10 and 80 wt.%, between about 10 and 60 wt.%, between about 10 and 40 wt.%,
 15  between about 10 and 20 wt.%, between about 15 and 80 wt.%, between about 15 and 60
     wt.%, between about 15 and 40 wt.%, between about 15 and 20 wt.%, between about 20
     and 80 wt.%, between about 20 and 60 wt.%, between about 20 and 40 wt.%, between
     about 5 and 20 wt.%, between about 30 and 80 wt.%, between about 30 and 60 wt.%,
     between about 30 and 40 wt.%, between about 40 and 80 wt.%, between about 40 and 60
 20  wt.%).
             As the layer 18 travels as indicated by arrow A, it becomes drier and drier due to
     the vacuum drawing liquid out of the layer and into the drum. By the time it reaches
     knife 28 it is relatively dry, e.g., having a moisture content of less than about 50% (less
     than 40%, less than 35%, less than 30%, less than 25% or even less than 20%), for
 25  example between 20 and 50%, between 20 and 40%, or between 30 and 50%.
             The choice of the filter cloth depends on the application, e.g., the degree of
     saccharification and initial particle size of the biomass. The filter cloth is porous (e.g.,
     permeable), to allow fluid to be drawn from material on its surface to the interior of the
     drum by the vacuum. For example, the filter cloth may be in the form of a wire screen,
 30  mesh, woven cloth or the like, and may be made of metal, synthetic fiber (e.g.,
     polypropylene, polyester, polyamide, poly vinyl alcohol), natural fiber (e.g., cotton) or
                                                    12

WO 2014/138535                                                              PCT/US2014/021584
     combinations of these and/or other materials. Cloths with porosity rating ranges from
     about 1 to 100 CFM/ft 2 can be utilized (e.g., about 1-3, about 1-10, about 10-30, about
     15-20, about 30 to 50, about 30-40, about 50 to 70). The porosity rating, CFM/ft 2 , for
     the cloth is determined by flowing air through the cloth and is the cubic feet per minute
  5  of air passing through one square foot of the media at 0.5 inches (water column) loss.
     The filter cloth can be woven, for example, with a twill weave, a plain weave, a satin
     weave, a knot weave, a basket weave, oxford weave and combinations of these. Different
     filament types can also be utilized, for example, spun, multifilament, monofilament,
     calendared multifilament, and combinations of these. FIG. 2 shows some types of filter
 10  cloths that can be used on the drum 12. For example 210 is a polyester plain weave filter
     cloth with a porosity of 45 Lm-2sec-1 (228.60 CFM/ ft2 ), 220 is a polyester twill weave
     with a porosity of 54 Lm-2sec-1 (274.32 CFM/ ft2 ), 230 is a polyester satin weave with a
     porosity of 22 Lm-2sec-1 (111.76 CFM/ ft2 ) and 240 is a polyester with a porosity of 22
     Lm-2sec-1 (111.76 CFM/ft2 ).
 15           Three examples of how filtration and concentration can be used in a feedstock
     conversion process are shown in FIGS. 3A, 3B and 3C. In all three examples,
     RVDF is used to separate a distillate bottom into a solid portion and a liquid portion.
     After removal of the solids from the distillate bottom, the filtrate can be subjected to
     further processing. Other examples are recognized as inventive that have not shown in
 20  the figures. For example, processes where filtration using a RVDF is applied before
     fermentation are optional embodiments of the invention.
              In the process shown in FIG. 3A, RVDF 340 is used to filter the distillate bottom
     (e.g., a concentrated mixture) that is obtained by saccharification 310, fermentation 320,
     and then distillation 330.
 25           In the process shown in FIG. 3B, RVDF 340 is used to filter a mixture that is
     obtained by saccharification 310, pre-filtration with a centrifuge 350, and then
     distillation 330. The centrifuge can be, for example, a continuous scroll decanter
     centrifuge.
              In the process shown in FIG. 3C, RVDF 340 is performed after the sequence of;
 30  saccharification 310, pre-filtration with a vibratory screening 360, and then
     distillation 330. The vibratory screener can have, for example, a mesh of between about

     10 - 200 (e.g., between about 20-100, between about 20 and 90, between about 20 and

     and 60, between about 60 and 90, between about 60 and 80, between about 60 and 70,
     between about 70 and 80, between about 70 and 90, between about 80 and 90, between
 10  about 50 and 150, between about 80-180, between about 50-110, between about 60-120,
     between about 40 and 110, between about 150 and 200).
              In some embodiments, prior to fermentation, it is preferable to remove a portion
     of the solids, leaving a suspension with between about 0 and 20 wt.% solids, (e.g.,
     between about 1 and 10 wt.%, between about 5 and 10 wt.%).
 15           It may also be preferable to denature any proteins that may be present after the
     saccharification and/or fermentation. For example the proteins may be denatured by
     raising or lowering the pH and/or heating the solutions.
              In each case, the solids recovered by RVDF can, for example, be burned in a co
     generation process to generate energy, used as a media additive in the fermentation
 20  processes discussed herein, and/or used as feed or other products.
              In some implementations, centrifugation or other filtration techniques may be
     used instead of or in addition to RVDF. For example, lignin and other solids may be
     removed at any desired stage of the process by centrifugation, e.g., using a continuous
     scroll decanter centrifuge.

                           SYSTEMS FOR TREATING A FEEDSTOCK
              Filtering systems, methods and equipment (e.g., RVDF) can be applied to
     materials that have been processed as described above and also as described anywhere
     herein.
  5           For example, processes for conversion of a feedstock to sugars and other
     products, in which the methods discuss above may be used, can include, for example,
     optionally physically pre-treating the feedstock, e.g., to reduce its size, before and/or
     after this treatment, optionally treating the feedstock to reduce its recalcitrance (e.g., by
     irradiation), and saccharifying the feedstock to form a sugar solution. Saccharification
 10  can be performed by mixing a dispersion of the feedstock in a liquid medium, e.g., water
     with an enzyme, as will be discussed in detail below. During or after saccharification,
     the mixture (if saccharification is to be partially or completely performed en route) or
     solution can be transported, e.g., by pipeline, railcar, truck or barge, to a manufacturing
     plant. After saccharification the solution can be filtered, for example utilizing RVDF. At
 15  the plant, the solution can be bioprocessed, e.g., fermented, to produce a desired product
     or intermediate, which can then be processed further, e.g., by distillation, RVDF. The
     individual processing steps, materials used and examples of products and intermediates
     that may be formed will be described in detail below
 20                                 RADIATION TREATMENT
              The feedstock can be treated with radiation to modify its structure to reduce its
     recalcitrance. Such treatment can, for example, reduce the average molecular weight of
     the feedstock, change the crystalline structure of the feedstock, and/or increase the
 25  surface area and/or porosity of the feedstock. Radiation can be by, for example electron
     beam, ion beam, 100 nm to 280 nm ultraviolet (UV) light, gamma or X-ray radiation.
     Radiation treatments and systems for treatments are discussed in US. Patent 8,142,620
     and US. Patent Application Series No. 12/417, 731, the entire disclosures of which are
     incorporated herein by reference.

WO 2014/138535                                                              PCT/US2014/021584
             Each form of radiation ionizes the biomass via particular interactions, as
     determined by the energy of the radiation. Heavy charged particles primarily ionize
     matter via Coulomb scattering; furthermore, these interactions produce energetic
     electrons that may further ionize matter. Alpha particles are identical to the nucleus of a
  5  helium atom and are produced by the alpha decay of various radioactive nuclei, such as
     isotopes of bismuth, polonium, astatine, radon, francium, radium, several actinides, such
     as actinium, thorium, uranium, neptunium, curium, californium, americium, and
     plutonium. Electrons interact via Coulomb scattering and bremsstrahlung radiation
     produced by changes in the velocity of electrons.
 10          When particles are utilized, they can be neutral (uncharged), positively charged
     or negatively charged. When charged, the charged particles can bear a single positive or
     negative charge, or multiple charges, e.g., one, two, three or even four or more charges.
     In instances in which chain scission is desired to change the molecular structure of the
     carbohydrate containing material, positively charged particles may be desirable, in part,
 15  due to their acidic nature. When particles are utilized, the particles can have the mass of
     a resting electron, or greater, e.g., 500, 1000, 1500, or 2000 or more times the mass of a
     resting electron. For example, the particles can have a mass of from about 1 atomic unit
     to about 150 atomic units, e.g., from about 1 atomic unit to about 50 atomic units, or
     from about I to about 25, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12 or 15 atomic units.
 20          Gamma radiation has the advantage of a significant penetration depth into a
     variety of material in the sample.
             In embodiments in which the irradiating is performed with electromagnetic
     radiation, the electromagnetic radiation can have, e.g., energy per photon (in electron
     volts) of greater than 102 eV, e.g., greater than 103, 104, 105, 106, or even greater than
 25  107 eV. In some embodiments, the electromagnetic radiation has energy per photon of
     between 104 and 107, e.g., between 105 and 106 eV. The electromagnetic radiation can
     have a frequency of, e.g., greater than 1016 Hz, greater than 1017 Hz, 1018, 1019, 1020, or
     even greater than 1021 Hz. In some embodiments, the electromagnetic radiation has a
     frequency of between 1018 and 1022 Hz, e.g., between 1019 to 1021 Hz.
 30          Electron bombardment may be performed using an electron beam device that has
     a nominal energy of less than 10 MeV, e.g., less than 7 MeV, less than 5 MeV, or less
                                                    16

WO 2014/138535                                                                PCT/US2014/021584
     than 2 MeV, e.g., from about 0.5 to 1.5 MeV, from about 0.8 to 1.8 MeV, or from about
     0.7 to 1 MeV. In some implementations the nominal energy is about 500 to 800 keV.
             The electron beam may have a relatively high total beam power (the combined
     beam power of all accelerating heads, or, if multiple accelerators are used, of all
  5  accelerators and all heads), e.g., at least 25 kW, e.g., at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 65, 70, 80,
     100, 125, or 150 kW. In some cases, the power is even as high as 500 kW, 750 kW, or
     even 1000 kW or more. In some cases the electron beam has a beam power of 1200 kW
     or more, e.g., 1400, 1600, 1800, or even 3000 kW.
             This high total beam power is usually achieved by utilizing multiple accelerating
 10  heads. For example, the electron beam device may include two, four, or more
     accelerating heads. The use of multiple heads, each of which has a relatively low beam
     power, prevents excessive temperature rise in the material, thereby preventing burning of
     the material, and also increases the uniformity of the dose through the thickness of the
     layer of material.
 15          It is generally preferred that the bed of biomass material has a relatively uniform
     thickness. In some embodiments the thickness is less than about 1 inch (e.g., less than
     about 0.75 inches, less than about 0.5 inches, less than about 0.25 inches, less than about
     0.1 inches, between about 0.1 and 1 inch, between about 0.2 and 0.3 inches).
             It is desirable to treat the material as quickly as possible. In general, it is
 20  preferred that treatment be performed at a dose rate of greater than about 0.25 Mrad per
     second, e.g., greater than about 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, or even greater than
     about 20 Mrad per second, e.g., about 0.25 to 2 Mrad per second. Higher dose rates
     allow a higher throughput for a target (e.g., the desired) dose. Higher dose rates generally
     require higher line speeds, to avoid thermal decomposition of the material. In one
 25  implementation, the accelerator is set for 3 MeV, 50 mA beam current, and the line
     speed is 24 feet/minute, for a sample thickness of about 20 mm (e.g., comminuted corn
     cob material with a bulk density of 0.5 g/cm 3).
             In some embodiments, electron bombardment is performed until the material
     receives a total dose of at least 0.1 Mrad, 0.25 Mrad, 1 Mrad, 5 Mrad, e.g., at least 10,
 30  20, 30 or at least 40 Mrad. In some embodiments, the treatment is performed until the
     material receives a dose of from about 10 Mrad to about 50 Mrad, e.g., from about 20
                                                     17

WO 2014/138535                                                              PCT/US2014/021584
     Mrad to about 40 Mrad, or from about 25 Mrad to about 30 Mrad. In some
     implementations, a total dose of 25 to 35 Mrad is preferred, applied ideally over a couple
     of passes, e.g., at 5 Mrad/pass with each pass being applied for about one second.
     Cooling methods, systems and equipment can be utilized before, after, during and/or
  5  between irradiations (e.g., cooled screw conveyors and cooled vibratory conveyors).
             Using multiple heads as discussed above, the material can be treated in multiple
     passes, for example, two passes at 10 to 20 Mrad/pass, e.g., 12 to 18 Mrad/pass,
     separated by a few seconds of cool-down, or three passes of 7 to 12 Mrad/pass, e.g., 5 to
     20 Mrad/pass, 10 to 40 Mrad/pass, 9 to 11 Mrad/pass. As discussed herein, treating the
 10  material with several relatively low doses, rather than one high dose, tends to prevent
     overheating of the material and also increases dose uniformity through the thickness of
     the material. In some implementations, the material is stirred or otherwise mixed during
     or after each pass and then smoothed into a uniform layer again before the next pass, to
     further enhance treatment uniformity.
 15          In some embodiments, electrons are accelerated to, for example, a speed of
     greater than 75 percent of the speed of light, e.g., greater than 85, 90, 95, or 99 percent of
     the speed of light.
             In some embodiments, any processing described herein occurs on lignocellulosic
     material that remains dry as acquired or that has been dried, e.g., using heat and/or
 20  reduced pressure. For example, in some embodiments, the cellulosic and/or
     lignocellulosic material has less than about 25 wt. % retained water, measured at 25'C
     and at fifty percent relative humidity (e.g., less than about 20 wt.%, less than about 15
     wt.%, less than about 14 wt.%, less than about 13 wt.%, less than about 12 wt.%, less
     than about 10 wt.%, less than about 9 wt.%, less than about 8 wt.%, less than about 7
 25  wt.%, less than about 6 wt.%, less than about 5 wt.%, less than about 4 wt.%, less than
     about 3 wt.%, less than about 2 wt.%, less than about 1 wt.%, or less than about 0.5
     wt.%.
             In some embodiments, two or more ionizing sources can be used, such as two or
     more electron sources. For example, samples can be treated, in any order, with a beam
 30  of electrons, followed by gamma radiation and UV light having wavelengths from about
                                                    18

WO 2014/138535                                                                 PCT/US2014/021584
     100 nm to about 280 nm. In some embodiments, samples are treated with three ionizing
     radiation sources, such as a beam of electrons, gamma radiation, and energetic UV light.
     The biomass is conveyed through the treatment zone where it can be bombarded with
     electrons.
  5           It may be advantageous to repeat the treatment to more thoroughly reduce the
     recalcitrance of the biomass and/or further modify the biomass. In particular the process
     parameters can be adjusted after a first (e.g., second, third, fourth or more) pass
     depending on the recalcitrance of the material. In some embodiments, a conveyor can be
     used which includes a circular system where the biomass is conveyed multiple times
 10  through the various processes described above. In some other embodiments multiple
     treatment devices (e.g., electron beam generators) are used to treat the biomass multiple
     (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more) times. In yet other embodiments, a single electron beam generator
     may be the source of multiple beams (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more beams) that can be used for
     treatment of the biomass.
 15           The effectiveness in changing the molecular/supermolecular structure and/or
     reducing the recalcitrance of the carbohydrate-containing biomass depends on the
     electron energy used and the dose applied, while exposure time depends on the power
     and dose. In some embodiments, the dose rate and total dose are adjusted so as not to
     destroy (e.g., char or bum) the biomass material. For example, the carbohydrates should
 20  not be damaged in the processing so that they can be released from the biomass intact,
     e.g. as monomeric sugars.
              In some embodiments, the treatment (with any electron source or a combination
     of sources) is performed until the material receives a dose of at least about 0.05 Mrad,
     e.g., at least about 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60,
 25  70, 80, 90, 100, 125, 150, 175, or 200 Mrad. In some embodiments, the treatment is
     performed until the material receives a dose of between 0.1-100 Mrad, 1-200, 5-200, 10
     200, 5-150, 50-150 Mrad, 5-100, 5-50, 5-40, 10-50, 10-75, 15-50, 20-35 Mrad.
              In some embodiments, relatively low doses of radiation are utilized, e.g., to
     increase the molecular weight of a cellulosic or lignocellulosic material (with any
 30  radiation source or a combination of sources described herein). For example, a dose of at
     least about 0.05 Mrad, e.g., at least about 0.1 Mrad or at least about 0.25, 0.5, 0.75. 1.0,

WO 2014/138535                                                               PCT/US2014/021584
     1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, or at least about 5.0 Mrad. In some embodiments, the
     irradiation is performed until the material receives a dose of between 0. 1Mrad and 2.0
     Mrad, e.g., between 0.5Mrad and 4.0 Mrad or between 1.0 Mrad and 3.0 Mrad.
              It also can be desirable to irradiate from multiple directions, simultaneously or
  5  sequentially, in order to achieve a desired degree of penetration of radiation into the
     material. For example, depending on the density and moisture content of the material,
     such as wood, and the type of radiation source used (e.g., gamma or electron beam), the
     maximum penetration of radiation into the material may be only about 0.75 inch. In such
     instances, a thicker section (up to 1.5 inch) can be irradiated by first irradiating the
 10  material from one side, and then turning the material over and irradiating from the other
     side. Irradiation from multiple directions can be particularly useful with electron beam
     radiation, which irradiates faster than gamma radiation but typically does not achieve as
     great a penetration depth.
 15                             RADIATION OPAQUE MATERIALS
              The invention can include processing the material (e.g., for some of the
     processing steps) in a vault and/or bunker that is constructed using radiation opaque
     materials. In some implementations, the radiation opaque materials are selected to be
 20  capable of shielding the components from X-rays with high energy (short wavelength),
     which can penetrate many materials. One important factor in designing a radiation
     shielding enclosure is the attenuation length of the materials used, which will determine
     the required thickness for a particular material, blend of materials, or layered structure.
     The attenuation length is the penetration distance at which the radiation is reduced to
 25  approximately l/e (e = Eulers number) times that of the incident radiation. Although
     virtually all materials are radiation opaque if thick enough, materials containing a high
     compositional percentage (e.g., density) of elements that have a high Z value (atomic
     number) have a shorter radiation attenuation length and thus if such materials are used a
     thinner, lighter shielding can be provided. Examples of high Z value materials that are
 30  used in radiation shielding are tantalum and lead. Another important parameter in
                                                      20

WO 2014/138535                                                               PCT/US2014/021584
     radiation shielding is the halving distance, which is the thickness of a particular material
     that will reduce gamma ray intensity by 50%. As an example for X-ray radiation with
     an energy of 0.1 MeV the halving thickness is about 15.1 mm for concrete and about 2.7
     mm for lead, while with an X-ray energy of 1 MeV the halving thickness for concrete is
  5  about 44.45 mm and for lead is about 7.9 mm. Radiation opaque materials can be
     materials that are thick or thin so long as they can reduce the radiation that passes
     through to the other side. Thus, if it is desired that a particular enclosure have a low wall
     thickness, e.g., for light weight or due to size constraints, the material chosen should
     have a sufficient Z value and/or attenuation length so that its halving length is less than
 10  or equal to the desired wall thickness of the enclosure.
              In some cases, the radiation opaque material may be a layered material, for
     example having a layer of a higher Z value material, to provide good shielding, and a
     layer of a lower Z value material to provide other properties (e.g., structural integrity,
     impact resistance, etc.). In some cases, the layered material may be a "graded-Z"
 15  laminate, e.g., including a laminate in which the layers provide a gradient from high-Z
     through successively lower-Z elements. In some cases the radiation opaque materials can
     be interlocking blocks, for example, lead and/or concrete blocks can be supplied by
     NELCO Worldwide (Burlington, MA), and reconfigurable vaults can be utilized.
              A radiation opaque material can reduce the radiation passing through a structure
 20  (e.g., a wall, door, ceiling, enclosure, a series of these or combinations of these) formed
     of the material by about at least about 10 %, (e.g., at least about 20%, at least about 30%,
     at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least
     about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about
     97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, at least about 99.9%, at least about 99.99%,
 25  at least about 99.999%) as compared to the incident radiation. Therefore, an enclosure
     made of a radiation opaque material can reduce the exposure of
     equipment/system/components by the same amount. Radiation opaque materials can
     include stainless steel, metals with Z values above 25 (e.g., lead, iron), concrete, dirt, and
     and combinations thereof. Radiation opaque materials can include a barrier in the
 30  direction of the incident radiation of at least about 1mm (e.g., 5 mm, 10mm, 5 cm, 10
     cm, 100cm, Im or even about 10 m).

                                       RADIATION SOURCES
              The type of radiation determines the kinds of radiation sources used as well as the
  5  radiation devices and associated equipment. The methods, systems and equipment
     described herein, for example for treating materials with radiation, can utilized sources
     as described herein as well as any other useful source.
              Sources of gamma rays include radioactive nuclei, such as isotopes of cobalt,
     calcium, technetium, chromium, gallium, indium, iodine, iron, krypton, samarium,
 10  selenium, sodium, thallium, and xenon.
              Sources of X-rays include electron beam collision with metal targets, such as
     tungsten or molybdenum or alloys, or compact light sources, such as those produced
     commercially by Lyncean.
              Alpha particles are identical to the nucleus of a helium atom and are produced by
 15  the alpha decay of various radioactive nuclei, such as isotopes of bismuth, polonium,
     astatine, radon, francium, radium, several actinides, such as actinium, thorium, uranium,
     neptunium, curium, californium, americium, and plutonium.
              Sources for ultraviolet radiation include deuterium or cadmium lamps.
              Sources for infrared radiation include sapphire, zinc, or selenide window ceramic
 20  lamps.
              Sources for microwaves include klystrons, Slevin type RF sources, or atom beam
     sources that employ hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen gases.
              Accelerators used to accelerate the particles (e.g., electrons or ions) can be DC
     (e.g., electrostatic DC or electrodynamic DC), RF linear, magnetic induction linear or
 25  continuous wave. For example, various irradiating devices may be used in the methods
     disclosed herein, including field ionization sources, electrostatic ion separators, field
     ionization generators, thermionic emission sources, microwave discharge ion sources,

              Electrons may be produced by radioactive nuclei that undergo beta decay, such as
     isotopes of iodine, cesium, technetium, and iridium. Alternatively, an electron gun can
 20  be used as an electron source via thermionic emission and accelerated through an
     accelerating potential. An electron gun generates electrons, which are then accelerated
     through a large potential (e.g., greater than about 500 thousand, greater than about
     1million, greater than about 2 million, greater than about 5 million, greater than about 6
     million, greater than about 7 million, greater than about 8 million, greater than about 9
 25  million, or even greater than 10 million volts) and then scanned magnetically in the x-y
     plane, where the electrons are initially accelerated in the z direction down the accelerator
     tube and extracted through a foil window. Scanning the electron beams is useful for
     increasing the irradiation surface when irradiating materials, e.g., a biomass, that is
     conveyed through the scanned beam. Scanning the electron beam also distributes the
 30  thermal load homogenously on the window and helps reduce the foil window rupture due
                                                   23

     to local heating by the electron beam. Window foil rupture is a cause of significant
     down-time due to subsequent necessary repairs and re-starting the electron gun.
              Various other irradiating devices may be used in the methods disclosed herein,
     including field ionization sources, electrostatic ion separators, field ionization generators,
  5  thermionic emission sources, microwave discharge ion sources, recirculating or static
     accelerators, dynamic linear accelerators, van de Graaff accelerators, and folded tandem
     accelerators. Such devices are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,931,784 to
     Medoff, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
              A beam of electrons can be used as the radiation source. A beam of electrons has
 10  the advantages of high dose rates (e.g., 1, 5, or even 10 Mrad per second), high
     throughput, less containment, and less confinement equipment. Electron beams can also
     have high electrical efficiency (e.g., 80%), allowing for lower energy usage relative to
     other radiation methods, which can translate into a lower cost of operation and lower
     greenhouse gas emissions corresponding to the smaller amount of energy used. Electron
 15  beams can be generated, e.g., by electrostatic generators, cascade generators, transformer
     generators, low energy accelerators with a scanning system, low energy accelerators with
     a linear cathode, linear accelerators, and pulsed accelerators.
              Electrons can also be more efficient at causing changes in the molecular structure
     of carbohydrate-containing materials, for example, by the mechanism of chain scission.
 20  In addition, electrons having energies of 0.5-10 MeV can penetrate low density
     materials, such as the biomass materials described herein, e.g., materials having a bulk
     density of less than 0.5 g/cm 3 , and a depth of 0.3-10 cm. Electrons as an ionizing
     radiation source can be useful, e.g., for relatively thin piles, layers or beds of materials,
     e.g., less than about 0.5 inch, e.g., less than about 0.4 inch, 0.3 inch, 0.25 inch, or less
 25  than about 0.1 inch. In some embodiments, the energy of each electron of the electron
     beam is from about 0.3 MeV to about 2.0 MeV (million electron volts), e.g., from about
     0.5 MeV to about 1.5 MeV, or from about 0.7 MeV to about 1.25 MeV. Methods of
     irradiating materials are discussed in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2012/0100577 Al, filed

     cables, wiring, voltage control systems, current control elements, insulating material,
     microcontrollers and cooling equipment can be purchased and assembled into a device.
     Optionally, a commercial device can be modified and/or adapted. For example, devices

     Typical electron energies can be 0.5 MeV, 1 MeV, 2 MeV, 4.5 MeV, 7.5 MeV, or 10
     MeV. Typical electron beam irradiation device power can be 1 kW, 5 kW, 10 kW, 20
 10  kW, 50 kW, 60 kW, 70 kW, 80 kW, 90 kW, 100 kW, 125 kW, 150 kW, 175 kW, 200

     900 kW or even 1000 kW. Accelerators that can be used include NHV irradiators
     medium energy series EPS-500 (e.g., 500 kV accelerator voltage and 65, 100 or 150 mA
     beam current), EPS-800 (e.g., 800 kV accelerator voltage and 65 or 100 mA beam
 15  current), or EPS-1000 (e.g., 1000 kV accelerator voltage and 65 or 100 mA beam
     current). Also, accelerators from NHV's high energy series can be used such as EPS
     1500 (e.g., 1500 kV accelerator voltage and 65 mA beam current), EPS-2000 (e.g., 2000
     kV accelerator voltage and 50 mA beam current), EPS-3000 (e.g., 3000 kV accelerator
     voltage and 50 mA beam current) and EPS-5000 (e.g., 5000 and 30 mA beam current).
 20          Tradeoffs in considering electron beam irradiation device power specifications
     include cost to operate, capital costs, depreciation, and device footprint. Tradeoffs in
     considering exposure dose levels of electron beam irradiation would be energy costs and
     environment, safety, and health (ESH) concerns. Typically, generators are housed in a
     vault, e.g., of lead or concrete, especially for production from X-rays that are generated
 25  in the process. Tradeoffs in considering electron energies include energy costs.
             The electron beam irradiation device can produce either a fixed beam or a
     scanning beam. A scanning beam may be advantageous with large scan sweep length
     and high scan speeds, as this would effectively replace a large, fixed beam width.
     Further, available sweep widths of 0.5 m, 1 m, 2 m or more are available. The scanning

              The extraction system for an electron accelerator can include two window foils.
     The cooling gas in the two foil window extraction system can be a purge gas or a
  5  mixture, for example air, or a pure gas. In one embodiment the gas is an inert gas such
     as nitrogen, argon, helium and or carbon dioxide. It is preferred to use a gas rather than a
     liquid since energy losses to the electron beam are minimized. Mixtures of pure gas can
     also be used, either pre-mixed or mixed in line prior to impinging on the windows or in
     the space between the windows. The cooling gas can be cooled, for example, by using a
 10  heat exchange system (e.g., a chiller) and/or by using boil off from a condensed gas (e.g.,
     liquid nitrogen, liquid helium). Window foils are described in PCT/US2013/64332 filed

           HEATING AND THROUGHPUT DURING RADIATION TREATMENT
 15
              Several processes can occur in biomass when electrons from an electron beam
     interact with matter in inelastic collisions. For example, ionization of the material, chain
     scission of polymers in the material, cross linking of polymers in the material, oxidation
     of the material, generation of X-rays ("Bremsstrahlung") and vibrational excitation of
 20  molecules (e.g., phonon generation). Without being bound to a particular mechanism, the
     reduction in recalcitrance can be due to several of these inelastic collision effects, for
     example ionization, chain scission of polymers, oxidation and phonon generation. Some
     of the effects (e.g., especially X-ray generation), necessitate shielding and engineering
     barriers, for example, enclosing the irradiation processes in a concrete (or other radiation
 25  opaque material) vault. Another effect of irradiation, vibrational excitation, is equivalent
     to heating up the sample. Heating the sample by irradiation can help in recalcitrance
     reduction, but excessive heating can destroy the material, as will be explained below.
              The adiabatic temperature rise (AT) from adsorption of ionizing radiation is given
     by the equation: AT = D/Cp: where D is the average dose in kGy, Cp is the heat capacity
 30  in J/g 0 C, and AT is the change in temperature in 0C. A typical dry biomass material will

     have a heat capacity close to 2. Wet biomass will have a higher heat capacity dependent
     on the amount of water since the heat capacity of water is very high ( 4.19 J/g C).
     Metals have much lower heat capacities, for example, 304 stainless steel has a heat
     capacity of 0.5 J/g C. The temperature change due to the instant adsorption of radiation
  5  in a biomass and stainless steel for various doses of radiation is shown in Table 1. At
     high temperatures, deviation from the calculated temperatures is expected due to
     decomposition of the biomass.

              High temperatures can destroy and or modify the biopolymers in biomass so that
     the polymers (e.g., cellulose) are unsuitable for further processing. A biomass subjected
     to high temperatures can become dark, sticky and give off odors indicating
     decomposition. The stickiness can even make the material hard to convey. The odors can
 15  be unpleasant and be a safety issue. In fact, keeping the biomass below about 200 0 C has
     been found to be beneficial in the processes described herein (e.g., below about 190 0 C,
     below about 180 0C, below about 170 0 C, below about 160 0 C, below about 150 0 C, below
     about 140 0 C, below about 130 0 C, below about 120 0 C, below about 1 100 C, between

              It has been found that irradiation above about 10 Mrad is desirable for the
     processes described herein (e.g., reduction of recalcitrance). A high throughput is also
     desirable so that the irradiation does not become a bottle neck in processing the biomass.
     The treatment is governed by a Dose rate equation: M = FP/D-time, where M is the mass
  5  of irradiated material (Kg), F is the fraction of power that is adsorbed (unit less), P is the
     emitted power (kW=Voltage in MeV x Current in mA), time is the treatment time (sec)
     and D is the adsorbed dose (kGy). In an exemplary process where the fraction of
     adsorbed power is fixed, the Power emitted is constant and a set dosage is desired, the
     throughput (e.g., M, the biomass processed) can be increased by increasing the
 10  irradiation time. However, increasing the irradiation time without allowing the material
     to cool, can excessively heat the material as exemplified by the calculations shown
     above. Since biomass has a low thermal conductivity (less than about 0.1 Wm-'K-'), heat
     dissipation is slow, unlike, for example metals (greater than about 10 Wm-'K-1 ) which
     can dissipate energy quickly as long as there is a heat sink to transfer the energy to.
 15
                                ELECTRON GUNS - BEAM STOPS
              In some embodiments the systems and methods include a beam stop (e.g., a
     shutter). For example, the beam stop can be used to quickly stop or reduce the
 20  irradiation of material without powering down the electron beam device. Alternatively
     the beam stop can be used while powering up the electron beam, e.g., the beam stop can
     stop the electron beam until a beam current of a desired level is achieved. The beam stop
     can be placed between the primary foil window and a secondary foil window. For
     example the beam stop can be mounted so that it is movable, that is, so that it can be
 25  moved into and out of the beam path. Even partial coverage of the beam can be used, for
     example, to control the dose of irradiation. The beam stop can be mounted to the floor,
     to a conveyor for the biomass, to a wall, to the radiation device (e.g., at the scan horn), or
     to any structural support. Preferably the beam stop is fixed in relation to the scan horn so
     that the beam can be effectively controlled by the beam stop. The beam stop can
 30  incorporate a hinge, a rail, wheels, slots, or other means allowing for its operation in
     moving into and out of the beam. The beam stop can be made of any material that will

     stop at least 5% of the electrons, e.g., at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, at
     least 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or even about
     100% of the electrons.
              The beam stop can be made of a metal including, but not limited to, stainless
  5  steel, lead, iron, molybdenum, silver, gold, titanium, aluminum, tin, or alloys of these, or
     laminates (layered materials) made with such metals (e.g., metal-coated ceramic, metal
     coated polymer, metal-coated composite, multilayered metal materials).
              The beam stop can be cooled, for example, with a cooling fluid such as an
     aqueous solution or a gas. The beam stop can be partially or completely hollow, for
 10  example with cavities. Interior spaces of the beam stop can be used for cooling fluids
     and gases. The beam stop can be of any shape, including flat, curved, round, oval,
     square, rectangular, beveled and wedged shapes.
              The beam stop can have perforations so as to allow some electrons through, thus
     controlling (e.g., reducing) the levels of radiation across the whole area of the window,
 15  or in specific regions of the window. The beam stop can be a mesh formed, for example,
     from fibers or wires. Multiple beam stops can be used, together or independently, to
     control the irradiation. The beam stop can be remotely controlled, e.g., by radio signal or
     hard wired to a motor for moving the beam into or out of position.
 20                                         BEAM DUMPS
              The embodiments disclosed herein can also include a beam dump when utilizing
     a radiation treatment. A beam dump's purpose is to safely absorb a beam of charged
     particles. Like a beam stop, a beam dump can be used to block the beam of charged
 25  particles. However, a beam dump is much more robust than a beam stop, and is intended
     to block the full power of the electron beam for an extended period of time. They are
     often used to block the beam as the accelerator is powering up.
              Beam dumps are also designed to accommodate the heat generated by such
     beams, and are usually made from materials such as copper, aluminum, carbon,
 30  beryllium, tungsten, or mercury. Beam dumps can be cooled, for example, using a
     cooling fluid that can be in thermal contact with the beam dump.

              Lignocellulosic materials, such as can be used in the methods and equipment
     described herein include, but are not limited to, wood, particle board, forestry wastes
  5  (e.g., sawdust, aspen wood, wood chips), grasses, (e.g., switchgrass, miscanthus, cord
     grass, reed canary grass), grain residues, (e.g., rice hulls, oat hulls, wheat chaff, barley
     hulls), agricultural waste (e.g., silage, canola straw, wheat straw, barley straw, oat straw,
     rice straw, jute, hemp, flax, bamboo, sisal, abaca, corn cobs, corn stover, soybean stover,
     corn fiber, alfalfa, hay, coconut hair), sugar processing residues (e.g., bagasse, beet pulp,
 10  agave bagasse), , algae, seaweed, manure, sewage, and mixtures of any of these.
              In some cases, the lignocellulosic material includes corncobs. Ground or
     hammermilled corncobs can be spread in a layer of relatively uniform thickness for
     irradiation, and after irradiation are easy to disperse in the medium for further
     processing. To facilitate harvest and collection, in some cases the entire corn plant is
 15  used, including the corn stalk, corn kernels, and in some cases even the root system of
     the plant.
              Advantageously, no additional nutrients (other than a nitrogen source, e.g., urea
     or ammonia) are required during fermentation of corncobs or cellulosic or lignocellulosic
     materials containing significant amounts of corncobs.
 20           Corncobs, before and after comminution, are also easier to convey and disperse,
     and have a lesser tendency to form explosive mixtures in air than other cellulosic or
     lignocellulosic materials such as hay and grasses.
              Cellulosic materials include, for example, paper, paper products, paper waste,
     paper pulp, pigmented papers, loaded papers, coated papers, filled papers, magazines,
 25  printed matter (e.g., books, catalogs, manuals, labels, calendars, greeting cards,
     brochures, prospectuses, newsprint), printer paper, polycoated paper, card stock,
     cardboard, paperboard, materials having a high a-cellulose content such as cotton, and
     mixtures of any of these. For example paper products as described in U.S. App. No.

              Cellulosic materials can also include lignocellulosic materials which have been
     partially or fully de-lignified.
              In some instances other biomass materials can be utilized, for example starchy
     materials. Starchy materials include starch itself, e.g., corn starch, wheat starch, potato
  5  starch or rice starch, a derivative of starch, or a material that includes starch, such as an
     edible food product or a crop. For example, the starchy material can be arracacha,
     buckwheat, banana, barley, cassava, kudzu, ocra, sago, sorghum, regular household
     potatoes, sweet potato, taro, yams, or one or more beans, such as favas, lentils or peas.
     Blends of any two or more starchy materials are also starchy materials. Mixtures of
 10  starchy, cellulosic and or lignocellulosic materials can also be used. For example, a
     biomass can be an entire plant, a part of a plant or different parts of a plant, e.g., a wheat
     plant, cotton plant, a corn plant, rice plant or a tree. The starchy materials can be treated
     by any of the methods described herein.
              Microbial materials that can be used as feedstock can include, but are not limited
 15  to, any naturally occurring or genetically modified microorganism or organism that
     contains or is capable of providing a source of carbohydrates (e.g., cellulose), for
     example, protists, e.g., animal protists (e.g., protozoa such as flagellates, amoeboids,
     ciliates, and sporozoa) and plant protists (e.g., algae such alveolates,
     chlorarachniophytes, cryptomonads, euglenids, glaucophytes, haptophytes, red algae,
 20  stramenopiles, and viridaeplantae). Other examples include seaweed, plankton (e.g.,
     macroplankton, mesoplankton, microplankton, nanoplankton, picoplankton, and
     femptoplankton), phytoplankton, bacteria (e.g., gram positive bacteria, gram negative
     bacteria, and extremophiles), yeast and/or mixtures of these. In some instances,
     microbial biomass can be obtained from natural sources, e.g., the ocean, lakes, bodies of
 25  water, e.g., salt water or fresh water, or on land. Alternatively or in addition, microbial
     biomass can be obtained from culture systems, e.g., large scale dry and wet culture and
     fermentation systems.
              In other embodiments, the biomass materials, such as cellulosic, starchy and
     lignocellulosic feedstock materials, can be obtained from transgenic microorganisms and
 30  plants that have been modified with respect to a wild type variety. Such modifications
     may be, for example, through the iterative steps of selection and breeding to obtain
                                                    31

     desired traits in a plant. Furthermore, the plants can have had genetic material removed,
     modified, silenced and/or added with respect to the wild type variety. For example,
     genetically modified plants can be produced by recombinant DNA methods, where
     genetic modifications include introducing or modifying specific genes from parental
  5  varieties, or, for example, by using transgenic breeding wherein a specific gene or genes
     are introduced to a plant from a different species of plant and/or bacteria. Another way
     to create genetic variation is through mutation breeding wherein new alleles are
     artificially created from endogenous genes. The artificial genes can be created by a
     variety of ways including treating the plant or seeds with, for example, chemical
 10  mutagens (e.g., using alkylating agents, epoxides, alkaloids, peroxides, formaldehyde),
     irradiation (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays, neutrons, beta particles, alpha particles, protons,
     deuterons, UV radiation) and temperature shocking or other external stressing and
     subsequent selection techniques. Other methods of providing modified genes is through
     error prone PCR and DNA shuffling followed by insertion of the desired modified DNA
 15  into the desired plant or seed. Methods of introducing the desired genetic variation in the
     seed or plant include, for example, the use of a bacterial carrier, biolistics, calcium
     phosphate precipitation, electroporation, gene splicing, gene silencing, lipofection,
     microinjection and viral carriers. Additional genetically modified materials have been

     0.50, 0.35, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05 or less, e.g., less than about 0.025 g/cm 3. Bulk
     density is determined using ASTM D1895B. Briefly, the method involves filling a
 15  measuring cylinder of known volume with a sample and obtaining a weight of the
     sample. The bulk density is calculated by dividing the weight of the sample in grams by
     the known volume of the cylinder in cubic centimeters. If desired, low bulk density
     materials can be densified, for example, by methods described in US. Pat. No. 7,971,809
     published July 5, 2011, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by
 20  reference.
             In some cases, the pre-treatment processing includes screening of the biomass
     material. Screening can be through a mesh or perforated plate with a desired opening
     size, for example, less than about 6.35 mm (1/4 inch, 0.25 inch), (e.g., less than about
     3.18 mm (1/8 inch, 0.125 inch), less than about 1.59 mm (1/16 inch, 0.0625 inch), is less
 25  than about 0.79 mm (1/32 inch, 0.03125 inch), e.g., less than about 0.51 mm (1/50 inch,
     0.02000 inch), less than about 0.40 mm (1/64 inch, 0.015625 inch), less than about 0.23
     mm (0.009 inch), less than about 0.20 mm (1/128 inch, 0.0078125 inch), less than about
     0.18 mm (0.007 inch), less than about 0.13 mm (0.005 inch), or even less than about 0.10
     mm (1/256 inch, 0.00390625 inch)). In one configuration the desired biomass falls
 30  through the perforations or screen and thus biomass larger than the perforations or screen
     are not irradiated. These larger materials can be re-processed, for example by
                                                    34

WO 2014/138535                                                              PCT/US2014/021584
     comminuting, or they can simply be removed from processing. In another configuration
     material that is larger than the perforations is irradiated and the smaller material is
     removed by the screening process or recycled. In this kind of a configuration, the
     conveyor, such as a vibratory conveyor, itself (for example a part of the conveyor) can be
  5  perforated or made with a mesh. For example, in one particular embodiment the biomass
     material may be wet and the perforations or mesh allow water to drain away from the
     biomass before irradiation.
              Screening of material can also be by a manual method, for example by an
     operator or mechanoid (e.g., a robot equipped with a color, reflectivity or other sensor)
 10  that removes unwanted material. Screening can also be by magnetic screening wherein a
     magnet is disposed near the conveyed material and the magnetic material is removed
     magnetically.
              Optional pre-treatment processing can include heating the material. For example
     a portion of a conveyor conveying the biomass or other material can be sent through a
 15  heated zone. The heated zone can be created, for example, by IR radiation, microwaves,
     combustion (e.g., gas, coal, oil, biomass), resistive heating and/or inductive coils. The
     heat can be applied from at least one side or more than one side, can be continuous or
     periodic and can be for only a portion of the material or all the material. For example, a
     portion of the conveying trough can be heated by use of a heating jacket. Heating can
 20  be, for example, for the purpose of drying the material. In the case of drying the
     material, this can also be facilitated, with or without heating, by the movement of a gas
     (e.g., air, oxygen, nitrogen, He, C0 2, Argon) over and/or through the biomass as it is
     being conveyed.
              Optionally, pre-treatment processing can include cooling the material. Cooling
 25  material is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,900,857 published March 8, 2011, the disclosure
     of which in incorporated herein by reference. For example, cooling can be by supplying
     a cooling fluid, for example water (e.g., with glycerol), or nitrogen (e.g., liquid nitrogen)
     to the bottom of the conveying trough. Alternatively, a cooling gas, for example, chilled
     nitrogen can be blown over the biomass materials or under the conveying system.
 30           Another optional pre-treatment processing method can include adding a material
     to the biomass or other feedstocks. The additional material can be added by, for
                                                    35

WO 2014/138535                                                             PCT/US2014/021584
     example, by showering, sprinkling and or pouring the material onto the biomass as it is
     conveyed. Materials that can be added include, for example, metals, ceramics and/or
     ions as described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2010/0105119 Al (filed October 26, 2009) and
     U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2010/0159569 Al (filed December 16, 2009), the entire disclosures
  5  of which are incorporated herein by reference. Optional materials that can be added
     include acids and bases. Other materials that can be added are oxidants (e.g., peroxides,
     chlorates), polymers, polymerizable monomers (e.g., containing unsaturated bonds),
     water, catalysts, enzymes and/or organisms. Materials can be added, for example, in
     pure form, as a solution in a solvent (e.g., water or an organic solvent) and/or as a
 10  solution. In some cases the solvent is volatile and can be made to evaporate e.g., by
     heating and/or blowing gas as previously described. The added material may form a
     uniform coating on the biomass or be a homogeneous mixture of different components
     (e.g., biomass and additional material). The added material can modulate the subsequent
     irradiation step by increasing the efficiency of the irradiation, damping the irradiation or
 15  changing the effect of the irradiation (e.g., from electron beams to X-rays or heat). The
     method may have no impact on the irradiation but may be useful for further downstream
     processing. The added material may help in conveying the material, for example, by
     lowering dust levels.
              Biomass can be delivered to conveyor (e.g., vibratory conveyors that can be used
 20  in the vaults herein described) by a belt conveyor, a pneumatic conveyor, a screw
     conveyor, a hopper, a pipe, manually or by a combination of these. The biomass can, for
     example, be dropped, poured and/or placed onto the conveyor by any of these methods.
     In some embodiments the material is delivered to the conveyor using an enclosed
     material distribution system to help maintain a low oxygen atmosphere and/or control
 25  dust and fines. Lofted or air suspended biomass fines and dust are undesirable because
     these can form an explosion hazard or damage the window foils of an electron gun (if
     such a device is used for treating the material).
              The material can be leveled to form a uniform thickness between about 0.0312
     and 5 inches (e.g., between about 0.0625 and 2.000 inches, between about 0.125 and 1
 30  inches, between about 0.125 and 0.5 inches, between about 0.3 and 0.9 inches, between
     about 0.2 and 0.5 inches between about 0.25 and 1.0 inches, between about 0.25 and 0.5

  5  0.025 inches, 0.900 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.900 +/- 0.025 inches.
              Generally, it is preferred to convey the material as quickly as possible through the
     electron beam to maximize throughput. For example the material can be conveyed at
     rates of at least 1 ft/min, e.g., at least 2 ft/min, at least 3 ft/min, at least 4 ft/min, at least 5
     ft/min, at least 10 ft/min, at least 15 ft/min, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 ft/min. The rate of
 10  conveying is related to the beam current, for example, for a          inch thick biomass and
     100 mA, the conveyor can move at about 20 ft/min to provide a useful irradiation
     dosage, at 50 mA the conveyor can move at about 10 ft/min to provide approximately the
     same irradiation dosage.
              After the biomass material has been conveyed through the radiation zone,
 15  optional post-treatment processing can be done. The optional post-treatment processing
     can, for example, be a process described with respect to the pre-irradiation processing.
     For example, the biomass can be screened, heated, cooled, and/or combined with
     additives. Uniquely to post-irradiation, quenching of the radicals can occur, for example,
     quenching of radicals by the addition of fluids or gases (e.g., oxygen, nitrous oxide,
 20  ammonia, liquids), using pressure, heat, and/or the addition of radical scavengers. For
     example, the biomass can be conveyed out of the enclosed conveyor and exposed to a
     gas (e.g., oxygen) where it is quenched, forming caboxylated groups. In one
     embodiment the biomass is exposed during irradiation to the reactive gas or fluid.
     Quenching of biomass that has been irradiated is described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,083,906
 25  published Dec 27, 2011, the entire disclosure of which is incorporate herein by reference.
              If desired, one or more mechanical treatments can be used in addition to
     irradiation to further reduce the recalcitrance of the carbohydrate-containing material.
     These processes can be applied before, during and or after irradiation.
              In some cases, the mechanical treatment may include an initial preparation of the
 30  feedstock as received, e.g., size reduction of materials, such as by comminution, e.g.,
     cutting, grinding, shearing, pulverizing or chopping. For example, in some cases, loose
                                                      37

WO 2014/138535                                                              PCT/US2014/021584
     feedstock (e.g., recycled paper, starchy materials, or switchgrass) is prepared by shearing
     or shredding. Mechanical treatment may reduce the bulk density of the carbohydrate
     containing material, increase the surface area of the carbohydrate-containing material
     and/or decrease one or more dimensions of the carbohydrate-containing material.
  5           Alternatively, or in addition, the feedstock material can be treated with another
     treatment, for example chemical treatments, such as with an acid (HCl, H 2SO 4 , H 3PO 4 ), a
     base (e.g., KOH and NaOH), a chemical oxidant (e.g., peroxides, chlorates, ozone),
     irradiation, steam explosion, pyrolysis, sonication, oxidation, chemical treatment. The
     treatments can be in any order and in any sequence and combinations. For example, the
 10  feedstock material can first be physically treated by one or more treatment methods, e.g.,
     chemical treatment including and in combination with acid hydrolysis (e.g., utilizing
     HCl, H 2SO 4, H 3PO 4), radiation, sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis or steam explosion, and
     then mechanically treated. This sequence can be advantageous since materials treated by
     one or more of the other treatments, e.g., irradiation or pyrolysis, tend to be more brittle
 15  and, therefore, it may be easier to further change the structure of the material by
     mechanical treatment. As another example, a feedstock material can be conveyed
     through ionizing radiation using a conveyor as described herein and then mechanically
     treated. Chemical treatment can remove some or all of the lignin (for example, chemical
     pulping) and can partially or completely hydrolyze the material. The methods also can
 20  be used with pre-hydrolyzed material. The methods also can be used with material that
     has not been pre hydrolyzed. The methods can be used with mixtures of hydrolyzed and
     non-hydrolyzed materials, for example, with about 50% or more non-hydrolyzed
     material, with about 60% or more non- hydrolyzed material, with about 70% or more
     non-hydrolyzed material, with about 80% or more non-hydrolyzed material or even with
 25  90% or more non-hydrolyzed material.
              In addition to size reduction, which can be performed initially and/or later in
     processing, mechanical treatment can also be advantageous for "opening up,"
     "stressing," breaking or shattering the carbohydrate-containing materials, making the
     cellulose of the materials more susceptible to chain scission and/or disruption of
 30  crystalline structure during the physical treatment.

WO 2014/138535                                                              PCT/US2014/021584
             Methods of mechanically treating the carbohydrate-containing material include,
     for example, milling or grinding. Milling may be performed using, for example, a
     hammer mill, ball mill, colloid mill, conical or cone mill, disk mill, edge mill, Wiley
     mill, grist mill or other mill. Grinding may be performed using, for example, a
  5  cutting/impact type grinder. Some exemplary grinders include stone grinders, pin
     grinders, coffee grinders, and burr grinders. Grinding or milling may be provided, for
     example, by a reciprocating pin or other element, as is the case in a pin mill. Other
     mechanical treatment methods include mechanical ripping or tearing, other methods that
     apply pressure to the fibers, and air attrition milling. Suitable mechanical treatments
 10  further include any other technique that continues the disruption of the internal structure
     of the material that was initiated by the previous processing steps.
             Mechanical feed preparation systems can be configured to produce streams with
     specific characteristics such as, for example, specific maximum sizes, specific length-to
     width, or specific surface areas ratios. Physical preparation can increase the rate of
 15  reactions, improve the movement of material on a conveyor, improve the irradiation
     profile of the material, improve the radiation uniformity of the material, or reduce the
     processing time required by opening up the materials and making them more accessible
     to processes and/or reagents, such as reagents in a solution.
             The bulk density of feedstocks can be controlled (e.g., increased). In some
 20  situations, it can be desirable to prepare a low bulk density material, e.g., by densifying
     the material (e.g., densification can make it easier and less costly to transport to another
     site) and then reverting the material to a lower bulk density state (e.g., after transport).
     The material can be densified, for example from less than about 0.2 g/cc to more than
     about 0.9 g/cc (e.g., less than about 0.3 to more than about 0.5 g/cc, less than about 0.3 to
 25  more than about 0.9 g/cc, less than about 0.5 to more than about 0.9 g/cc, less than about
     0.3 to more than about 0.8 g/cc, less than about 0.2 to more than about 0.5 g/cc). For
     example, the material can be densified by the methods and equipment disclosed in U.S.
     Pat. No. 7,932,065 to Medoff and International Publication No. WO 2008/073186
     (which was filed October 26, 2007, was published in English, and which designated the
 30  United States), the full disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
     Densified materials can be processed by any of the methods described herein, or any
                                                    39

     material processed by any of the methods described herein can be subsequently
     densified.
              In some embodiments, the material to be processed is in the form of a fibrous
     material that includes fibers provided by shearing a fiber source. For example, the
  5  shearing can be performed with a rotary knife cutter.
              For example, a fiber source, e.g., that is recalcitrant or that has had its
     recalcitrance level reduced, can be sheared, e.g., in a rotary knife cutter, to provide a first
     fibrous material. The first fibrous material is passed through a first screen, e.g., having
     an average opening size of 1.59 mm or less (1/16 inch, 0.0625 inch), provide a second
 10  fibrous material. If desired, the fiber source can be cut prior to the shearing, e.g., with a
     shredder. For example, when a paper is used as the fiber source, the paper can be first
     cut into strips that are, e.g., 1/4- to 1/2-inch wide, using a shredder, e.g., a counter
     rotating screw shredder, such as those manufactured by Munson (Utica, N.Y.). As an
     alternative to shredding, the paper can be reduced in size by cutting to a desired size
 15  using a guillotine cutter. For example, the guillotine cutter can be used to cut the paper
     into sheets that are, e.g., 10 inches wide by 12 inches long.
              In some embodiments, the shearing of the fiber source and the passing of the
     resulting first fibrous material through a first screen are performed concurrently. The
     shearing and the passing can also be performed in a batch-type process.
 20           For example, a rotary knife cutter can be used to concurrently shear the fiber
     source and screen the first fibrous material. A rotary knife cutter includes a hopper that
     can be loaded with a shredded fiber source prepared by shredding a fiber source.
              In some implementations, the feedstock is physically treated prior to
     saccharification and/or fermentation. Physical treatment processes can include one or
 25  more of any of those described herein, such as mechanical treatment, chemical treatment,
     irradiation, sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis or steam explosion. Treatment methods can
     be used in combinations of two, three, four, or even all of these technologies (in any
     order). When more than one treatment method is used, the methods can be applied at the
     same time or at different times. Other processes that change a molecular structure of a
 30  biomass feedstock may also be used, alone or in combination with the processes
     disclosed herein.

              If desired, one or more sonication, pyrolysis, oxidative, or steam explosion
     processes can be used instead of or in addition to irradiation to reduce or further reduce
 10  the recalcitrance of the carbohydrate-containing material. For example, these processes
     can be applied before, during and or after irradiation. These processes are described in
     detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,932,065 to Medoff, the full disclosure of which is incorporated

 15                            INTERMEDIATES AND PRODUCTS
              Using the processes described herein, the biomass material can be converted to
     one or more products, such as energy, fuels, foods and materials. For example,
     intermediates and products such as organic acids, salts of organic acids, anhydrides,
 20  esters of organic acids and fuels, e.g., fuels for internal combustion engines or feedstocks
     for fuel cells can be produced. Systems and processes are described herein that can use
     as feedstock cellulosic and/or lignocellulosic materials that are readily available, but
     often can be difficult to process, e.g., municipal waste streams and waste paper streams,
     such as streams that include newspaper, kraft paper, corrugated paper or mixtures of
 25  these.
              Specific examples of products include, but are not limited to, hydrogen, sugars
     (e.g., glucose, xylose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, fructose, disaccharides,
     oligosaccharides and polysaccharides), alcohols (e.g., monohydric alcohols or dihydric
     alcohols, such as ethanol, n-propanol, isobutanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol or n-butanol),

     bombardment, for example, by at a dosage of less than about 20 Mrad, e.g., from about

     streams can be used in a distillation process. As another example, electricity generated
     from burning by-product streams can be used to power electron beam generators used in
     pretreatment.
             The by-products used to generate steam and electricity are derived from a number
  5  of sources throughout the process. For example, anaerobic digestion of wastewater can

     another example, post-saccharification and/or post-distillate solids (e.g., unconverted
     lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose remaining from the pretreatment and primary
     processes) can be used, e.g., burned, as a fuel.

                                   LIGNIN DERIVED PRODUCTS
 15
             The spent biomass (e.g., spent lignocellulosic material) from lignocellulosic
     processing by the methods described are expected to have a high lignin content and in
     addition to being useful for producing energy through combustion in a Co-Generation
     plant, may have uses as other valuable products. For example, the lignin can be used as
 20  captured as a plastic, or it can be synthetically upgraded to other plastics. In some
     instances, it can also be converted to lignosulfonates, which can be utilized as binders,
     dispersants, emulsifiers or as sequestrants.
             When used as a binder, the lignin or a lignosulfonate can, e.g., be utilized in coal
     briquettes, in ceramics, for binding carbon black, for binding fertilizers and herbicides,
 25  as a dust suppressant, in the making of plywood and particle board, for binding animal
     feeds, as a binder for fiberglass, as a binder in linoleum paste and as a soil stabilizer.
             When used as a dispersant, the lignin or lignosulfonates can be used, e.g.,
     concrete mixes, clay and ceramics, dyes and pigments, leather tanning and in gypsum
     board.
 30          When used as an emulsifier, the lignin or lignosulfonates can be used, e.g., in
     asphalt, pigments and dyes, pesticides and wax emulsions.
                                                   43

WO 2014/138535                                                             PCT/US2014/021584
              When used as a sequestrant, the lignin or lignosulfonates can be used, e.g., in
     micro-nutrient systems, cleaning compounds and water treatment systems, e.g., for boiler
     and cooling systems.
              For energy production lignin generally has a higher energy content than
  5  holocellulose (cellulose and hemicellulose) since it contains more carbon than
     homocellulose. For example, dry lignin can have an energy content of between about
     11,000 and 12,500 BTU per pound, compared to 7,000 an 8,000 BTU per pound of
     holocellulose. As such, lignin can be densified and converted into briquettes and pellets
     for burning. For example, the lignin can be converted into pellets by any method
 10  described herein. For a slower burning pellet or briquette, the lignin can be crosslinked,
     such as applying a radiation dose of between about 0.5 Mrad and 5 Mrad. Crosslinking
     can make a slower burning form factor. The form factor, such as a pellet or briquette,
     can be converted to a "synthetic coal" or charcoal by pyrolyzing in the absence of air,
     e.g., at between 400 and 950 'C. Prior to pyrolyzing, it can be desirable to crosslink the
 15  lignin to maintain structural integrity.
                                       SACCHARIFICATION
              As previously described, in order to convert the feedstock to a form that can be
 20  readily processed the glucan- or xylan-containing cellulose in the feedstock can be
     hydrolyzed to low molecular weight carbohydrates, such as sugars, by a saccharifying
     agent, e.g., an enzyme or acid, a process referred to as saccharification. The low
     molecular weight carbohydrates can then be used, for example, in an existing
     manufacturing plant, such as a single cell protein plant, an enzyme manufacturing plant,
 25  or a fuel plant, e.g., an ethanol manufacturing facility.
              As previously disclosed, the feedstock can be hydrolyzed using an enzyme, e.g.,
     by combining the materials and the enzyme in a solvent, e.g., in an aqueous solution.
              Alternatively, the enzymes can be supplied by organisms that break down
     biomass, such as the cellulose and/or the lignin portions of the biomass, contain or
 30  manufacture various cellulolytic enzymes (cellulases), ligninases or various small
                                                   44

WO 2014/138535                                                              PCT/US2014/021584
     molecule biomass-degrading metabolites. These enzymes may be a complex of enzymes
     that act synergistically to degrade crystalline cellulose or the lignin portions of biomass.
     Examples of cellulolytic enzymes include: endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and
     cellobiases (beta-glucosidases).
  5           During saccharification a cellulosic substrate can be initially hydrolyzed by
     endoglucanases at random locations producing oligomeric intermediates. These
     intermediates are then substrates for exo-splitting glucanases such as cellobiohydrolase
     to produce cellobiose from the ends of the cellulose polymer. Cellobiose is a water
     soluble 1,4-linked dimer of glucose. Finally, cellobiase cleaves cellobiose to yield
 10  glucose. The efficiency (e.g., time to hydrolyze and/or completeness of hydrolysis) of
     this process depends on the recalcitrance of the cellulosic material.
              Therefore, the treated biomass materials can be saccharified, by combining the
     material and a cellulase enzyme in a fluid medium, e.g., an aqueous solution. In some
     cases, the material is boiled, steeped, or cooked in hot water prior to saccharification, as
 15  described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2012/0100577 Al by Medoff and Masterman, published
     on April 26, 2012, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein.
              The saccharification process can be partially or completely performed in a tank
     (e.g., a tank having a volume of at least 4000, 40,000, or 500,000 L) in a manufacturing
     plant, and/or can be partially or completely performed in transit, e.g., in a rail car, tanker
 20  truck, or in a supertanker or the hold of a ship. The time required for complete
     saccharification will depend on the process conditions and the carbohydrate-containing
     material and enzyme used. If saccharification is performed in a manufacturing plant
     under controlled conditions, the cellulose may be substantially entirely converted to
     sugar, e.g., glucose in about 12-96 hours. If saccharification is performed partially or
 25  completely in transit, saccharification may take longer.
              It is generally preferred that the tank contents be mixed during saccharification,
     e.g., using jet mixing as described in International App. No. PCT/US2010/035331, filed
     May 18, 2010, which was published in English as WO 2010/135380 and designated the
     United States, the full disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.

WO 2014/138535                                                              PCT/US2014/021584
             The addition of surfactants can enhance the rate of saccharification. Examples of
     surfactants include non-ionic surfactants, such as a Tween@ 20 or Tween 80
     polyethylene glycol surfactants, ionic surfactants, or amphoteric surfactants.
             It is generally preferred that the concentration of the sugar solution resulting from
  5  saccharification be relatively high, e.g., greater than 40%, or greater than 50, 60, 70, 80,
     90 or even greater than 95% by weight. Water may be removed, e.g., by evaporation, to
     increase the concentration of the sugar solution. This reduces the volume to be shipped,
     and also inhibits microbial growth in the solution.
             Alternatively, sugar solutions of lower concentrations may be used, in which case
 10  it may be desirable to add an antimicrobial additive, e.g., a broad spectrum antibiotic, in
     a low concentration, e.g., 50 to 150 ppm. Other suitable antibiotics include amphotericin
     B, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, hygromycin B, kanamycin,
     neomycin, penicillin, puromycin, streptomycin. Antibiotics will inhibit growth of
     microorganisms during transport and storage, and can be used at appropriate
 15  concentrations, e.g., between 15 and 1000 ppm by weight, e.g., between 25 and 500 ppm,
     or between 50 and 150 ppm. If desired, an antibiotic can be included even if the sugar
     concentration is relatively high. Alternatively, other additives with anti-microbial of
     preservative properties may be used. Preferably the antimicrobial additive(s) are food
     grade.
 20          A relatively high concentration solution can be obtained by limiting the amount
     of water added to the carbohydrate-containing material with the enzyme. The
     concentration can be controlled, e.g., by controlling how much saccharification takes
     place. For example, concentration can be increased by adding more carbohydrate
     containing material to the solution. In order to keep the sugar that is being produced in
 25  solution, a surfactant can be added, e.g., one of those discussed above. Solubility can
     also be increased by increasing the temperature of the solution. For example, the
     solution can be maintained at a temperature of 40-50'C, 60-80'C, or even higher.

 25            In addition to or in combination to enzymes, acids, bases and other chemicals
     (e.g., oxidants) can be utilized to saccharify lignocellulosic and cellulosic materials.
     These can be used in any combination or sequence (e.g., before, after and/or during
     addition of an enzyme). For example, strong mineral acids can be utilized (e.g. HCl,
     H 2 SO 4 , H 3 PO 4 ) and strong bases (e.g., NaOH, KOH).

                                          FERMENTATION
             Yeast and Zymomonas bacteria, for example, can be used for fermentation or
     conversion of sugar(s) to alcohol(s). Other microorganisms are discussed below. The
 25  optimum pH for fermentations is about pH 4 to 7. For example, the optimum pH for
     yeast is from about pH 4 to 5, while the optimum pH for Zymomonas is from about pH 5
     to 6. Typical fermentation times are about 24 to 168 hours (e.g., 24 to 96 hrs) with
     temperatures in the range of 20'C to 40'C (e.g., 26'C to 40'C), however thermophilic
     microorganisms prefer higher temperatures.
 30          In some embodiments, e.g., when anaerobic organisms are used, at least a portion
     of the fermentation is conducted in the absence of oxygen, e.g., under a blanket of an

     inert gas such as N2, Ar, He, C02 or mixtures thereof. Additionally, the mixture may
     have a constant purge of an inert gas flowing through the tank during part of or all of the
     fermentation. In some cases, anaerobic condition, can be achieved or maintained by
     carbon dioxide production during the fermentation and no additional inert gas is needed.
  5           In some embodiments, all or a portion of the fermentation process can be
     interrupted before the low molecular weight sugar is completely converted to a product
     (e.g., ethanol). The intermediate fermentation products include sugar and carbohydrates
     in high concentrations. The sugars and carbohydrates can be isolated via any means
     known in the art. These intermediate fermentation products can be used in preparation of
 10  food for human or animal consumption. Additionally or alternatively, the intermediate
     fermentation products can be ground to a fine particle size in a stainless-steel laboratory
     mill to produce a flour-like substance. Jet mixing may be used during fermentation, and
     in some cases saccharification and fermentation are performed in the same tank.

             As previously described, after fermentation, the resulting fluids can be distilled
     using, for example, a "beer column" to separate ethanol and other alcohols from the
     majority of water and residual solids. The vapor exiting the beer column can be, e.g.,
 10  35% by weight ethanol and can be fed to a rectification column. A mixture of nearly
     azeotropic (92.5%) ethanol and water from the rectification column can be purified to
     pure (99.5%) ethanol using vapor-phase molecular sieves. The beer column bottoms can
     be sent to the first effect of a three-effect evaporator. The rectification column reflux
     condenser can provide heat for this first effect. After the first effect, solids can be
 15  separated using a centrifuge and dried in a rotary dryer. A portion (25%) of the
     centrifuge effluent can be recycled to fermentation and the rest sent to the second and
     third evaporator effects. Most of the evaporator condensate can be returned to the
     process as fairly clean condensate with a small portion split off to waste water treatment
     to prevent build-up of low-boiling compounds.

                                       CONVEYING SYSTEMS
  5
              Various conveying systems can be used to convey the biomass material, for
     example, as discussed, to a vault, and under an electron beam in a vault. Exemplary
     conveyors are belt conveyors, pneumatic conveyors, screw conveyors, carts, trains, trains
     or carts on rails, elevators, front loaders, backhoes, cranes, various scrapers and shovels,
 10  trucks, and throwing devices can be used. For example, vibratory conveyors can be used
     in various processes described herein. Vibratory conveyors are described in
     PCT/US2013/64289 filed October 10, 2013 the full disclosure of which is incorporated
     by reference herein.
              Vibratory conveyors are particularly useful for spreading the material and
 15  producing a uniform layer on the conveyor trough surface. For example the initial
     feedstock can form a pile of material that can be at least four feet high (e.g., at least
     about 3 feet, at least about 2 feet, at least about 1 foot, at least about 6 inches, at least
     about 5 inches, at least about, 4 inches, at least about 3 inches, at least about 2 inches, at
     least about 1 inch, at least about     inch) and spans less than the width of the conveyor
 20  (e.g., less than about 10%, less than about 20%, less than about 30%, less than about
     40%, less than about 50%, less than about 60%, less than about 70%, less than about
     80%, less than about 90%, less than about 95%, less than about 99%). The vibratory
     conveyor can spread the material to span the entire width of the conveyor trough and
     have a uniform thickness, preferably as discussed above. In some cases, an additional
 25  spreading method can be useful. For example, a spreader such as a broadcast spreader, a
     drop spreader (e.g., a CHRISTY SPREADER') or combinations thereof can be used to
     drop (e.g., place, pour, spill and/or sprinkle) the feedstock over a wide area. Optionally,
     the spreader can deliver the biomass as a wide shower or curtain onto the vibratory
     conveyor. Additionally, a second conveyor, upstream from the first conveyor (e.g., the
 30  first conveyor is used in the irradiation of the feedstock), can drop biomass onto the first
     conveyor, where the second conveyor can have a width transverse to the direction of
                                                     53

WO 2014/138535                                                                   PCT/US2014/021584
     conveying smaller than the first conveyor. In particular, when the second conveyor is a
     vibratory conveyor, the feedstock is spread by the action of the second and first
     conveyor. In some optional embodiments, the second conveyor ends in a bias cross cut
     discharge (e.g., a bias cut with a ratio of 4:1) so that the material can be dropped as a
  5  wide curtain (e.g., wider than the width of the second conveyor) onto the first conveyor.
     The initial drop area of the biomass by the spreader (e.g., broadcast spreader, drop
     spreader, conveyor, or cross cut vibratory conveyor) can span the entire width of the first
     vibratory conveyor, or it can span part of this width. Once dropped onto the conveyor,
     the material is spread even more uniformly by the vibrations of the conveyor so that,
 10  preferably, the entire width of the conveyor is covered with a uniform layer of biomass.
     In some embodiments combinations of spreaders can be used. Some methods of
     spreading a feed stock are described in U.S. Patent No. 7,153,533, filed July 23, 2002
     and published December 26, 2006, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein
     by reference.
 15           Generally, it is preferred to convey the material as quickly as possible through an
     electron beam to maximize throughput. For example, the material can be conveyed at
     rates of at least 1 ft/min, e.g., at least 2 ft/min, at least 3 ft/min, at least 4 ft/min, at least 5
     ft/min, at least 10 ft/min, at least 15 ft/min, at least 20 ft/min, at least 25 ft/min, at least
     30 ft/min, at least 40 ft/min, at least 50 ft/min, at least 60 ft/min, at least 70 ft/min, at
 20  least 80 ft/min, at least 90 ft/min. The rate of conveying is related to the beam current
     and targeted irradiation dose, for example, for a         inch thick biomass spread over a 5.5
     foot wide conveyor and 100 mA, the conveyor can move at about 20 ft/min to provide a
     useful irradiation dosage (e.g. about 10 Mrad for a single pass), at 50 mA the conveyor
     can move at about 10 ft/min to provide approximately the same irradiation dosage.
 25           The rate at which material can be conveyed depends on the shape and mass of the
     material being conveyed, and the desired treatment. Flowing materials e.g., particulate
     materials, are particularly amenable to conveying with vibratory conveyors. Conveying
     speeds can, for example be, at least 100 lb/hr (e.g., at least 500 lb/hr, at least 1000 lb/hr,
     at least 2000 lb/hr, at least 3000 lb/hr, at least 4000 lb/hr, at least 5000 lb/hr, at least
 30  10,000 lb/hr, at least 15, 000 lb/hr, or even at least 25,000 lb/hr). Some typical conveying
     speeds can be between about 1000 and 10,000 lb/hr, (e.g., between about 1000 lb/hr and
                                                      54

WO 2014/138535                                                              PCT/US2014/021584
     8000 lb/hr, between about 2000 and 7000 lb/hr, between about 2000 and 6000 lb/hr,
     between about 2000 and 50001b/hr, between about 2000 and 4500 lb/hr, between about
     1500 and 5000 lb/hr, between about 3000 and 7000 lb/hr, between about 3000 and 6000
     lb/hr, between about 4000 and 6000 lb/hr and between about 4000 and 5000 lb/hr).
  5  Typical conveying speeds depend on the density of the material. For example, for a
     biomass with a density of about 35 lb/ft 3, and a conveying speed of about 5000 lb/hr, the
     material is conveyed at a rate of about 143 ft3/hr, if the material is  " thick and is in a
     trough 5.5 ft wide, the material is conveyed at a rate of about 1250 ft/hr (about 21
     ft/min). Rates of conveying the material can therefore vary greatly. Preferably, for
 10  example, a     " thick layer of biomass, is conveyed at speeds of between about 5 and 100
     ft/min (e.g. between about 5 and 100 ft/min, between about 6 and 100 ft/min, between
     about 7 and 100 ft/min, between about 8 and 100 ft/min, between about 9 and 100 ft/min,
     between about 10 and 100 ft/min, between about 11 and 100 ft/min, between about 12
     and 100 ft/min, between about 13 and 100 ft/min, between about 14 and 100 ft/min,
 15  between about 15 and 100 ft/min, between about 20 and 100 ft/min, between about 30
     and 100 ft/min, between about 40 and 100 ft/min, between about 2 and 60 ft/min,
     between about 3 and 60 ft/min, between about 5 and 60 ft/min, between about 6 and 60
     ft/min, between about 7 and 60 ft/min, between about 8 and 60 ft/min, between about 9
     and 60 ft/min, between about 10 and 60 ft/min, between about 15 and 60 ft/min, between
 20  about 20 and 60 ft/min, between about 30 and 60 ft/min, between about 40 and 60 ft/min,
     between about 2 and 50 ft/min, between about 3 and 50 ft/min, between about 5 and 50
     ft/min, between about 6 and 50 ft/min, between about 7 and 50 ft/min, between about 8
     and 50 ft/min, between about 9 and 50 ft/min, between about 10 and 50 ft/min, between
     about 15 and 50 ft/min, between about 20 and 50 ft/min, between about 30 and 50 ft/min,
 25  between about 40 and 50 ft/min). It is preferable that the material be conveyed at a
     constant rate, for example, to help maintain a constant irradiation of the material as it
     passes under the electron beam (e.g., shower, field).
             The vibratory conveyors described can include screens used for sieving and
     sorting materials. Port openings on the side or bottom of the troughs can be used for
 30  sorting, selecting or removing specific materials, for example, by size or shape. Some
     conveyors have counterbalances to reduce the dynamic forces on the support structure.

     Some vibratory conveyors are configured as spiral elevators, are designed to curve
     around surfaces and/or are designed to drop material from one conveyor to another (e.g.,
     in a step, cascade or as a series of steps or a stair). Along with conveying materials
     conveyors can be used, by themselves or coupled with other equipment or systems, for
  5  screening, separating, sorting, classifying, distributing, sizing, inspection, picking, metal
     removing, freezing, blending, mixing, orienting, heating, cooking, drying, dewatering,
     cleaning, washing, leaching, quenching, coating, de-dusting and/or feeding. The
     conveyors can also include covers (e.g., dust-tight covers), side discharge gates, bottom
     discharge gates, special liners (e.g., anti-stick, stainless steel, rubber, custom steal, and or
 10  grooved), divided troughs, quench pools, screens, perforated plates, detectors (e.g., metal
     detectors), high temperature designs, food grade designs, heaters, dryers and or coolers.
     In addition, the trough can be of various shapes, for example, flat bottomed, vee shaped
     bottom, flanged at the top, curved bottom, flat with ridges in any direction, tubular, half
     pipe, covered or any combinations of these. In particular, the conveyors can be coupled
 15  with an irradiation systems and/or equipment.
             The conveyors (e.g., vibratory conveyor) can be made of corrosion resistant
     materials. The conveyors can utilize structural materials that include stainless steel (e.g.,
     304, 316 stainless steel, HASTELLOY@ ALLOYS and INCONEL@ Alloys). For
     example, HASTELLOY@ Corrosion-Resistant alloys from Hynes (Kokomo, Indiana,
 20  USA) such as HASTELLOY@ B-3@ ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ HYBRID-BC1@
     ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ C-4 ALLOY, HASTELLOY@ C-22@ ALLOY,

     HASTELLOY@ N ALLOY and HASTELLOY@ ULTIMET@ alloy.
 25          The vibratory conveyors can include non-stick release coatings, for example,
     TUFFLONTM (Dupont, Delaware, USA). The vibratory conveyors can also include
     corrosion resistant coatings. For example, coatings that can be supplied from Metal
     Coatings Corp (Houston, Texas, USA) and others such as Fluoropolymer, XYLAN@,
     Molybdenum Disulfide, Epoxy Phenolic, Phosphate- ferrous metal coating,
 30  Polyurethane- high gloss topcoat for epoxy, inorganic zinc, Poly Tetrafluoro ethylene,

     and Ceramic Epoxy Coating. The coatings can improve resistance to process gases (e.g.,
     ozone), chemical corrosion, pitting corrosion, galling corrosion and oxidation.
              Optionally, in addition to the conveying systems described herein, one or more
     other conveying systems can be enclosed. When using an enclosure, the enclosed
  5  conveyor can also be purged with an inert gas so as to maintain an atmosphere at a
     reduced oxygen level. Keeping oxygen levels low avoids the formation of ozone which
     in some instances is undesirable due to its reactive and toxic nature. For example, the
     oxygen can be less than about 20% (e.g., less than about 10%, less than about 1%, less
     than about 0.1%, less than about 0.01%, or even less than about 0.001% oxygen).
 10  Purging can be done with an inert gas including, but not limited to, nitrogen, argon,
     helium or carbon dioxide. This can be supplied, for example, from a boil off of a liquid
     source (e.g., liquid nitrogen or helium), generated or separated from air in situ, or
     supplied from tanks. The inert gas can be recirculated and any residual oxygen can be
     removed using a catalyst, such as a copper catalyst bed. Alternatively, combinations of
 15  purging, recirculating and oxygen removal can be done to keep the oxygen levels low.
              The enclosed conveyor can also be purged with a reactive gas that can react with
     the biomass. This can be done before, during or after the irradiation process. The
     reactive gas can be, but is not limited to, nitrous oxide, ammonia, oxygen, ozone,
     hydrocarbons, aromatic compounds, amides, peroxides, azides, halides, oxyhalides,
 20  phosphides, phosphines, arsines, sulfides, thiols, boranes and/or hydrides. The reactive
     gas can be activated in the enclosure, e.g., by irradiation (e.g., electron beam, UV
     irradiation, microwave irradiation, heating, IR radiation), so that it reacts with the
     biomass. The biomass itself can be activated, for example by irradiation. Preferably the
     biomass is activated by the electron beam, to produce radicals which then react with the
 25  activated or unactivated reactive gas, e.g., by radical coupling or quenching.
              Purging gases supplied to an enclosed conveyor can also be cooled, for example
     below about 25'C, below about 00 C, below about -40'C, below about -80'C, below
     about -120'C. For example, the gas can be boiled off from a compressed gas such as
     liquid nitrogen or sublimed from solid carbon dioxide. As an alternative example, the
 30  gas can be cooled by a chiller or part of or the entire conveyor can be cooled.

              Any material, processes or processed materials discussed herein can be used to
  5  make products and/or intermediates such as composites, fillers, binders, plastic additives,
     adsorbents and controlled release agents. The methods can include densification, for
     example, by applying pressure and heat to the materials. For example composites can be
     made by combining fibrous materials with a resin or polymer. For example radiation
     cross-linkable resin, e.g., a thermoplastic resin can be combined with a fibrous material
 10  to provide a fibrous material/cross-linkable resin combination. Such materials can be, for
     example, useful as building materials, protective sheets, containers and other structural
     materials (e.g., molded and/or extruded products). Absorbents can be, for example, in the
     form of pellets, chips, fibers and/or sheets. Adsorbents can be used, for example, as pet
     bedding, packaging material or in pollution control systems. Controlled release matrices
 15  can also be the form of, for example, pellets, chips, fibers and or sheets. The controlled
     release matrices can, for example, be used to release drugs, biocides, fragrances. For
     example, composites, absorbents and control release agents and their uses are described
     in International Application No. PCT/US2006/010648, filed March 23, 2006, and US
     Patent No. 8,074,910 filed November 22, 2011, the entire disclosures of which are herein
 20  incorporated by reference.
              In some instances the biomass material is treated at a first level to reduce
     recalcitrance, e.g., utilizing accelerated electrons, to selectively release one or more
     sugars (e.g., xylose). The biomass can then be treated to a second level to release one or
     more other sugars (e.g., glucose). Optionally the biomass can be dried between
 25  treatments. The treatments can include applying chemical and biochemical treatments to
     release the sugars. For example, a biomass material can be treated to a level of less than
     about 20 Mrad (e.g., less than about 15 Mrad, less than about 10 Mrad, less than about 5
     Mrad, less than about 2 Mrad) and then treated with a solution of sulfuric acid,
     containing less than 10% sulfuric acid (e.g., less than about 9%, less than about 8%, less
 30  than about 7%, less than about 6%, less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less than
     about 3%, less than about 2%, less than about 1%, less than about 0.75%, less than about

WO 2014/138535                                                              PCT/US2014/021584
     0.50 %, less than about 0.25%) to release xylose. Xylose, for example that is released
     into solution, can be separated from solids and optionally the solids washed with a
     solvent/solution (e.g., with water and/or acidified water). Optionally, the solids can be
     dried, for example in air and/or under vacuum optionally with heating (e.g., below about
  5  150 deg C, below about 120 deg C) to a water content below about 25 wt% (below about
     20 wt.%, below about 15 wt.%, below about 10 wt.%, below about 5 wt.%). The solids
     can then be treated with a level of less than about 30 Mrad (e.g., less than about 25 Mrad,
     less than about 20 Mrad, less than about 15 Mrad, less than about 10 Mrad, less than
     about 5 Mrad, less than about 1 Mrad or even not at all) and then treated with an enzyme
 10  (e.g., a cellulase) to release glucose. The glucose (e.g., glucose in solution) can be
     separated from the remaining solids. The solids can then be further processed, for
     example utilized to make energy or other products (e.g., lignin derived products).
              An optional embodiment for filtering materials described herein includes utilizing
     a Rotary Pressure Filter and/or a Vacuum Belt Filter. The saccharified material is filtered
 15  using this equipment where, in general, the product sugars are separated from the solids.
     The equipment provides the means to wash retained sugars from the filter solids. The
     filter cake can be used for energy, utilized for valuable components such as lignin
     derived products, or recycled for further bioprocessing.
              FIG. 4A shows a perspective exploded view of a Rotary Pressure Filter 400.
 20  Filter drum 410 rotates continuously in a pressure-sealed housing 420 at infinitely
     variable speed, for example, in the direction indicated by the curved dashed arrows. The
     drum is covered with a filter cloth, for example, as previously described for rotary
     vacuum drum filtration apparatus. Feedstock (e.g., saccharified biomass) enters the
     interior of the drum through ports (shown in FIGS 4B-4E) disposed on the bottom of
 25  drum housing. The annular space between drum and housing is sealed to the sides by
     stuffing boxes and divided into pressure-tight segment chambers by separating elements.
     The surface of the drum consists of filter cells 430 in fluid connection to drainage pipes
     440 through control head 450. The feedstock is forced through the filter cells, to the
     drainage pipes and exits as filtered liquid product at port 414 as indicated by arrow B
 30  (e.g., the arrow shows the flow of a filtered sugar solution derived from the saccharified
     material). Arrows A indicate a drying gas (e.g., air, nitrogen, steam, including super
                                                   59

WO 2014/138535                                                               PCT/US2014/021584
     heated steam) that enters through ports 412 as indicated by arrows A (e.g., arrows
     indicating the flow of the gas which dries the solids on the surface of the drum while
     forcing the liquids through the filter cells 430). Filter cake is removed from the drum
     surface and exits through discharge 416.
  5           Details of how the processing through the pressure filter are shown in more detail
     by side view partial cross section FIGS 4B, 4C, 4D and 4E. FIG. 4B shows a step of
     inputting the feedstock and filtering using the filter device. A feedstock (e.g.,
     saccharified material) is fed continuously through port 510 as indicated by the straight
     arrow C. The material is fed continuously and under pressure to the filter from below the
 10  drum. In the filter cells, a filter cake 520 forms on the filter elements and is carried into
     the flowing segment chambers by drum rotation (e.g., the rotation direction as indicated
     by the curved arrow). The filtrate drains off the cells through the pipe system, including
     pipes 440 to the control head. FIG. 4C shows a step of washing the filter cake.
     Optionally, e.g., depending on the application, washing, extraction or steaming can take
 15  place in one or more stages. As each segment chamber rotates past port 522 a washing
     fluid is forced through the cake and into the pipe system as indicated by the solid arrow
     D. For example, the washing fluid can be water, optionally with additives such as anti
     foam agents, chelates, viscosity modified, surfactants and/or pH modifiers (e.g., acids,
     bases, buffers). The washing fluid can optionally be heated or cooled to aid in the
 20  extraction process, for example, steam can be used. The washing fluid is drained through
     the pipe system to the control head. Although it can be desirable to extract as much of
     the soluble components as possible (e.g., sugars), the dilution of the components should
     be considered e.g., it may not be practical to dilute components excessively. FIG. 4D
     shows a cake drying step. As previously discussed a gas such as compressed air, nitrogen
 25  or steam can be made to flow through port 412 so as to dry the filter cake while forcing
     fluids into the tubing system and to the control head. FIG. 4E shows a step of
     discharging the cake from the drum surface. Discharging of the filter cake occurs in a
     discharge zone that is non-pressurized. The discharge zone can include a gas-tight hood
     if required. The cake is discharged by, for example, back-blowing and optionally, by a
 30  movable scraper. The filter cloth can then be washed. Filter cake 550 is removed through
     port 416. A device for cleaning the cake, either continuously or on demand, can also be
                                                     60

WO 2014/138535                                                                PCT/US2014/021584
     included, e.g., washing with a washing fluid, the fluid composition being as previously
     described.
              Another optional embodiment for filtering materials described herein includes
     utilizing an Indexing Belt Filter (e.g., a Vacuum Belt Filter). FIG. 5A shows a front
  5  schematic view of an Indexing Belt Filter 600. This filtration system includes an endless
     filter belt 602 (e.g., looped by tensioned rollers). The filter belt includes or is a filter
     cloth (e.g., as previously described for rotary vacuum drum filtering). The feedstock can
     be fed continuously or stepwise to the belt. The belt moves in a stepwise movement in
     the direction indicated by the arrows. Vacuum trays 614 are fixed in place on a frame
 10  that provides support for components of the apparatus (e.g., the rollers, the drive motors,
     the trays and the filter belt). The filter belt with the feedstock moves stepwise over the
     trays. Each time the belt stops, the filtrate is sucked downwards. Subsequently, the
     vacuum is shut off, releasing the filter belt which can be advanced (e.g., indexed or
     stepped) again. A filter cake forms on top of the belt and can undergo further treatment
 15  by washing (co-current or counter-current), re-slurrying, steaming, extraction, vacuum
     drying and pressing. The wash filtrates (e.g., sugar water) can be recovered individually
     from each vacuum tray and further processed. As shown and partially described, the
     filter system can be segmented into zones or phases wherein different processes occur. In
     phase 610 the feedstock is applied to the filter belt, phase 640 includes washing, phase
 20  660 includes a drying step and phase 680 is a cake discharging step. The details of each
     step are described with reference to FIGS 5B, 5C, 5D and 5E.
              The filter trays 614 are fixed to a frame and do not move with the belt. The trays
     are installed beneath the filter belt over the full length from the feed area 610 to before
     the cake discharge area 680. The trays supply a support to the belt but allow liquids to
 25  pass through. For example, the surface in contact with the belt can include a support grid
     619 to allow liquids to pass through. Located beneath the support grid are filtrate
     collecting channels 615.
              FIG. 5B shows a step and zone wherein a feedstock 612 (e.g., saccharified
     biomass) is added to the surface of the belt filter 602. Filtration occurs by the action of
 30  gravity and optionally vacuum applied under the belt as it is supported by each tray.
     Liquids flow e.g., as shown by the empty arrow through grid surface 619 away from the
                                                      61

WO 2014/138535                                                             PCT/US2014/021584
     trays and can be collected. A filter cake 617 forms as a layer on the filter belt and is
     incrementally carried forward in the direction shown by the filled arrows once the initial
     evacuation step is complete.
              FIG. 5C shows a washing step or zone. In this phase, soluble components in the
  5  filter cake that remain with the solid can be washed out. For example, sugars can be
     extracted by applying an aqueous solution. The solution can be water or water with
     additives. For example, additives as described previously such as anti-foam agents,
     chelates, viscosity modified, surfactants and/or pH modifiers (e.g., acids, bases, buffers).
     The washing fluid can optionally be heated or cooled to aid in the extraction process, for
 10  example, even steam can be used. The fluid can be poured onto the filter cake as
     depicted by 642 or it can be sprayed on (e.g., as droplets, a mist or even a vapor) as
     depicted by 644. Although it can be desirable to extract as much of the soluble
     components as possible (e.g., sugars), practical considerations may include not to
     diluting collected components excessively. The washings can be driven through the
 15  trays by a vacuum as in the previous phase. The washings flow in the direction indicated
     by the empty arrows and are collected for further processing (e.g., combined with the
     first sugar water from the first phase, recycled and/or concentrated). In some optional
     embodiments the washings from the second phase are re-used for additional washings
     until a specific concentration of extracted components is reached (e.g., sugars at least to
 20  1 wt%, 2 wt%, 5 wt%, 10 wt%).
              FIG. 5D shows a step and zone wherein drying can be done by applying the
     vacuum to the underside of the belt as previously described. Optionally, hot air or
     steaming hoods 662 can be used. For example, hot steam can be injected through
     applicator 664. Optionally, a mechanical means of drying can be utilized. For example,
 25  pressing device 666 can be utilized. Optionally, the pressing device can be a thermal
     pressing device, e.g., wherein the pressing device surface in contact with the filter cake,
     is heated. Liquids or fluids (e.g., gases such as vapor) can be made to flow as indicated
     by the open arrows and collected for further processing or recycling as previously
     discussed.
 30           FIG. 5E shows a cake discharge and belt cleaning section. The filter cake is
     discharged between the discharge rollers 682 and 684. A scraper can be installed 686 that
                                                   62

WO 2014/138535                                                               PCT/US2014/021584
     strips off any cake residue 688 still adhering to the belt at roller 684. The filter cake 617
     and residue 688 can be collected and further processed. A washing station 690 can wash
     and/or condition the filter belt before the belt loops back to the first zone 610.
              Rotary Pressure Filters and Indexing Belt filters can be purchased from BHS
  5  Sonthofen Inc. (Charlotte, N.C.) and used as designed or modified. One or more of each
     of these can be utilized in the filtering methods described. For example, filtering aids can
     be utilized. For example, one or more of each of these can be used to replace any of the
     filtering elements described in FIGs 3A, 3B or 3C. For example RVDF 340, centrifuge
     350, screener 360 can be replaced by a Rotary Pressure filter and/or an Indexing Belt
 10  Filter. Optionally or additionally one or more Rotary Pressure Filter and/or one or more
     Indexing Belt Filters can be used in addition to the filtering elements discussed. For
     example, an Indexing Belt Filter can be inserted between the screener 360 and the
     distillation 330 described by FIG. 3C, or a Rotary Pressure Filter can be inserted after the
     distillation 330 and before the RVDF 340 described in FIG. 3B.

              Any of the products and/or intermediates described herein, for example, produced
     by the processes, systems and/or equipment described herein, can be combined with
 20  flavors, fragrances, colorants and/or mixtures of these. For example, any one or more of
     (optionally along with flavors, fragrances and/or colorants) sugars, organic acids, fuels,
     polyols, such as sugar alcohols, biomass, fibers and composites can be combined with
     (e.g., formulated, mixed or reacted) or used to make other products. For example, one or
     more such product can be used to make soaps, detergents, candies, drinks (e.g., cola,
 25  wine, beer, liquors such as gin or vodka, sports drinks, coffees, teas), syrups,
     pharmaceuticals, adhesives, sheets (e.g., woven, none woven, filters, tissues) and/or
     composites (e.g., boards). For example, one or more such product can be combined with

     marmalade, ham, coffee and cheeses.
              Flavors, fragrances and colorants can be added in any amount, such as between
     about 0.001 wt.% to about 30 wt.%, e.g., between about 0.01 to about 20, between about
  5  0.05 to about 10, or between about 0.1 wt.% to about 5 wt.%. These can be formulated,
     mixed and or reacted (e.g., with any one of more product or intermediate described
     herein) by any means and in any order or sequence (e.g., agitated, mixed, emulsified,
     gelled, infused, heated, sonicated, and/or suspended). Fillers, binders, emulsifier,
     antioxidants can also be utilized, for example protein gels, starches and silica.
 10           In one embodiment the flavors, fragrances and colorants can be added to the
     biomass immediately after the biomass is irradiated such that the reactive sites created by
     the irradiation may react with reactive compatible sites of the flavors, fragrances, and
     colorants.
              The flavors, fragrances and colorants can be natural and/or synthetic materials.
 15  These materials can be one or more of a compound, a composition or mixtures of these
     (e.g., a formulated or natural composition of several compounds). Optionally the flavors,
     fragrances, antioxidants and colorants can be derived biologically, for example, from a
     fermentation process (e.g., fermentation of saccharified materials as described herein).
     Alternatively, or additionally these flavors, fragrances and colorants can be harvested
 20  from a whole organism (e.g., plant, fungus, animal, bacteria or yeast) or a part of an
     organism. The organism can be collected and or extracted to provide color, flavors,
     fragrances and/or antioxidant by any means including utilizing the methods, systems and
     equipment described herein, hot water extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, chemical
     extraction (e.g., solvent or reactive extraction including acids and bases), mechanical
 25  extraction (e.g., pressing, comminuting, filtering), utilizing an enzyme, utilizing a
     bacteria such as to break down a starting material, and combinations of these methods.
     The compounds can be derived by a chemical reaction, for example, the combination of
     a sugar (e.g., as produced as described herein) with an amino acid (Maillard reaction).
     The flavor, fragrance, antioxidant and/or colorant can be an intermediate and or product
 30  produced by the methods, equipment or systems described herein, for example and ester
     and a lignin derived product.

             Some examples of flavor, fragrances or colorants are polyphenols. Polyphenols
     are pigments responsible for the red, purple and blue colorants of many fruits,
     vegetables, cereal grains, and flowers. Polyphenols also can have antioxidant properties
     and often have a bitter taste. The antioxidant properties make these important
  5  preservatives. On class of polyphenols are the flavonoids, such as Anthocyanidines,
     flavanonols, flavan-3-ols, s, flavanones and flavanonols.    Other phenolic compounds
     that can be used include phenolic acids and their esters, such as chlorogenic acid and
     polymeric tannins.
             Among the colorants inorganic compounds, minerals or organic compounds can
 10  be used, for example titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, aluminum oxide, cadmium yellow
     (E.g., CdS), cadmium orange (e.g., CdS with some Se), alizarin crimson (e.g., synthetic
     or non-synthetic rose madder), ultramarine (e.g., synthetic ultramarine, natural
     ultramarine, synthetic ultramarine violet ), cobalt blue, cobalt yellow, cobalt green,
     viridian (e.g., hydrated chromium(III)oxide), chalcophylite, conichalcite, cornubite,
 15  cornwallite and liroconite. Black pigments such as carbon black and self-dispersed
     blacks may be used.

                                             EXAMPLES
     Saccharification
              Saccharified batches were produced as described here and used in the following
  5  examples 1 and 2.
              A cylindrical tank with a diameter of 32 Inches, 64 Inches in height and fit with
     ASME dished heads (top and bottom) was used in the saccharification. The tank was also
     equipped with a hydrofoil mixing blade 16" wide. Heating was provided by flowing hot
     water through a half pipe jacket surrounding the tank.
 10           The tank was charged with 200 Kg water, 80 Kg of biomass, and 18 Kg of
     DUET'       Cellulase enzyme. Biomass was corn cob that had been hammer milled and
     screened to a size of between 40 and 10 mesh. The biomass was irradiated with an
     electron beam to a total dosage of 35 Mrad. The pH of the mixture was adjusted and
     maintained automatically throughout the saccharification at 4.8 using Ca(OH)2. This
 15  combination was heated to 53 0C, stirred at 180 rpm (1.8 Amp at 460V) for about 24
     hours after which the saccharification was considered completed
     Example 1, Centrifuge followed by Rotory Vacuum Drum Filtration
              Solids were separated from saccharified batches using a continuous scroll
 20  decanter centrifuge with a 12 foot long drum. Centrifugation was performed immediately
     after the completion of saccharification at less than 60 0 C. Rates of centrifugation were
     30 gallons per minute with solids loading at 15 wt.%. Solids were free of standing liquid
     and tested at 50 wt.% (water) on drying or less. The liquids were used for fermentation
     with yeast, producing ethanol. Distillation was used to separate the ethanol from the
 25  other products. The liquids sent to fermentation contained about 5 wt.% solids.
              A rotary vacuum drum filter (RVDF) was used for filtering solid residues after
     the distillation. The 2 feet wide by 2 fee diameter drum (with approximately 6 square
     feet of filter cloth) was pre-coated with 2" of filter-aid. The feed stream of the distillation
     bottoms was 600 liters (5 wt.% solids) in 2 hours and used less than 1/101 the filter-aid
 30  from the pre-coating. The average knife advance speed was therefore less than 0. 1"/hr.
     The filtrate contained less than 0.1wt% solids (total suspended solids, TSS). Particles
                                                   72

WO 2014/138535                                                             PCT/US2014/021584
     down to about 0.5um (mean particle size) were removed. The turbidity was also very
     low, estimated at below about 5 NTU.
     Example 2, Vibratory screener followed by Rotary Vacuum Drum
  5           A vibratory screener with 60 mesh screens was used to remove solids from a
     saccharified material. This method leaves a small amount of fines in the stream. Solids
     were about 5 wt.% after this step. The screened material was fermented and then
     distilled. The distillation bottoms were filtered by RVDF under the same operating
     conditions as outlined above, rendering a filtered product with similar solids and
 10  turbidity relative to those given above.
              Other than in the examples herein, or unless otherwise expressly specified, all of
     the numerical ranges, amounts, values and percentages, such as those for amounts of
     materials, elemental contents, times and temperatures of reaction, ratios of amounts, and
 15  others, in the following portion of the specification and attached claims may be read as if
     prefaced by the word "about" even though the term "about" may not expressly appear
     with the value, amount, or range. Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the
     numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are
     approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be
 20  obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the
     application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical
     parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant
     digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.
              Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad
 25  scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific
     examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however,
     inherently contains error necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in its
     underlying respective testing measurements. Furthermore, when numerical ranges are
     set forth herein, these ranges are inclusive of the recited range end points (e.g.,., end
 30  points may be used). When percentages by weight are used herein, the numerical values
     reported are relative to the total weight.

             Also, it should be understood that any numerical range recited herein is intended
     to include all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example, a range of "1 to 10" is
     intended to include all sub-ranges between (and including) the recited minimum value of
     1 and the recited maximum value of 10, that is, having a minimum value equal to or
  5  greater than 1 and a maximum value of equal to or less than 10. The terms "one," "a," or
     "an" as used herein are intended to include "at least one" or "one or more," unless
     otherwise indicated.
             Any patent, publication, or other disclosure material, in whole or in part, that is
     said to be incorporated by reference herein is incorporated herein only to the extent that
 10  the incorporated material does not conflict with existing definitions, statements, or other
     disclosure material set forth in this disclosure. As such, and to the extent necessary, the
     disclosure as explicitly set forth herein supersedes any conflicting material incorporated
     herein by reference. Any material, or portion thereof, that is said to be incorporated by
     reference herein, but which conflicts with existing definitions, statements, or other
 15  disclosure material set forth herein will only be incorporated to the extent that no conflict
     arises between that incorporated material and the existing disclosure material.
             While this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to
     preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that
     various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the
 20  scope of the invention encompassed by the appended claims.
