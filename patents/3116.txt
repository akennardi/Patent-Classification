                                          TECHNICAL FIELD
10  [0002] Embodiments of this invention relate to ophthalmic laser surgery and, more particularly,
   to an ophthalmic interface apparatus used to stabilize the eye of a patient with respect to a laser
   beam during ophthalmic surgery, a and system and method of interfacing the eye with a surgical
   laser.
                                            BACKGROUND
15 [00031 In recent years, significant developments in laser technology have led to its application in
   the field of ophthalmic surgery. In particular, laser surgery has become the technique of choice
   for ophthalmic surgical applications. In certain ophthalmic laser procedures, surgeons use a
   mechanical device termed a microkeratome to cut a layer of the anterior surface of the cornea in
   order to expose the underlying corneal stroma to which the laser is applied. However,
20 complications surrounding the use of the microkeratome with a metal blade have resulted in
   research into improved techniques that are performed exclusively by a laser system. Such all
   laser techniques provide significant improvements over conventional mechanical devices.
                                                   -1-

       1002156133
       [0004] Despite these advances in laser technology, the use of such systems for ophthalmic
      surgical procedures remains fraught with substantial mechanical limitations, particularly in the
      area of developing a stable interface between an incident laser beam and the eye of a patient.
      Ophthalmic surgery is a precision operation and requires precise coupling between the surgical
  5   tool (i.e., the laser beam) and the region to be disturbed (i.e., a portion of the patient's eye).
      Movement of the eye with respect to the intended focal point of the laser beam can lead to non
      optimal results and might result in permanent damage to non-renewable tissue within the eye.
      Given that eye movement is often the result of autonomic reflex, techniques have been
     developed in an attempt to stabilize the position of a patient's eye with respect to an incident
 10  laser beam.
     [0005] One technique used to compensate for relative eye motion with respect to an incident
     laser beam is to have the patient focus on a stationary target. This involves providing a visual
     target to the eye undergoing surgery, and requiring that the patient retain focused on the
     perceived target feature. While this technique has provided some benefit, the patient bears a
15   significant burden of minimizing relative motion. This technique is also less tolerant of any
     significant gross autonomic reflex motions, e.g., as when the patient might be startled. In this
    technique, the target provides an optical interface, while the patient's conscious responses
    provide the feedback mechanism.
     [00061 Another technique involves the use of an optical eye tracking apparatus, whereby a
20  selected eye feature is targeted for monitoring by an optical device. As the targeted feature
    displaces as a result of eye movement, this displacement is characterized and fed into the
    incident laser beam control apparatus as a compensation signal. This technique offers a
    substantial improvement over the first, particularly when implemented in addition to a patient
                                                    -2-

       1002156133
      driven target focusing mechanism. However, such systems are inordinately expensive since a
      second, completely independent optical path is typically provided between a patient's eye and a
      surgical apparatus in order to accommodate the eye tracking apparatus. Further expense and
      complexity is incurred since an eye tracking apparatus requires an additional software
  5   component in order to be operative, which software component must be integrated into a laser
      delivery system. Considerations of interoperability must be met as well as the provision for an
      automatic shutdown of the laser system in the event of the loss of target feature lock.
      [0007] Mechanical stabilization devices have been proposed, for example, a corneal applanation
      device, which is the subject of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/172,819, filed Oct. 15, 1998,
 10   and commonly owned by the assignee of embodiments of this invention. Such a mechanical
     device directly couples a patient's eye to the laser's delivery system being affixed to both the
     laser and the anterior surface of a patient's cornea. The corneal coupling, in these devices, is
     typically implemented by lowering an applanation fixture over the anterior surface of the cornea
     under pressure. It is assumed in these forms of devices that pressure applied normal to the
15   corneal surface will restrict conventional motion of the cornea thereby stabilizing the eye along a
     major access normal to the device.
     [0008] However, although this assumption may hold true in a large number of cases, it certainly
     does not have universal application. Moreover, in the cases where it does hold, the device/cornea
     interface should be established with the iris centered, for best results. The actual establishment of
20   an effective device/corneal interface is an exercise in trial-and-error, resulting in a great deal of
     frustration to doctor and patient, as well as considerable eye fatigue.
     [0009] For ophthalmic laser procedures where eye tissue is to be photodisrupted, it is desirable
    to have proper focus of the laser beam to a specific focal spot in the tissue that is to be affected.
                                                      -3-

         1002156133
        Proper focus includes focal definition and proper dimensionality (i.e., the correct spot diameter
        and shape). To this end, it is helpful for the laser beam to be as free from aberrations as possible.
        In particular, for ophthalmic laser procedures involving the cornea, the spherical geometry of the
        cornea can introduce optical aberrations by its shape, and these are separate and distinct from
   5   aberrations that may be introduced by the laser optical system. Corneal induced aberrations can
       distort the definition of the focal spot of a laser beam as the beam is focused to a position within
       corneal tissue or deeper into the eye, such as the capsular bag or the natural lens.
       [00010]          Due to the spherical geometry of the anterior surface of the cornea, two specific
       types of aberrations are of particular importance with regard to beam distortion; spherical
 10    aberration (which relates to points on the optical axis of the laser beam) and coma (which relates
      to points that are off-axis). Spherical aberration and coma are similar to one another in that they
      both arise from a failure to image or focus optical ray traces onto the same point. Spherical
      aberration relates to a distortion that can be characterized as radial in nature, with some radial
      directions being stretched while other radial directions are shrunk, converting thereby an ideally
15    circular spot into an elliptical spot. Coma distortion, on the other hand, implies an elongation
      along one radius a circle, resulting in a "comet-like" shape. Accordingly, any structure which
     interfaces between a curved, anterior surface of the cornea and laser delivery system will likely
     encounter such aberration concerns.
      [0011] In view of the foregoing, it is thus evident that there is a need for a simple mechanical
20   interface device that is able to stabilize the eye against relative motion with respect to a laser
     beam used for ophthalmic surgical procedures without relying on secondary mechanical
     considerations, such as surface tension, friction, or the like. Such a device may be able to present
     an optical feature to an incident laser beam in a stable, well characterized location. In
                                                         -4-

      1002156133
      addition to maintaining a proper orientation between the eye and a laser delivery system during
      ophthalmic laser surgery, such a device may minimize intraocular pressure during the surgical
      procedure. Such a device may be easy for a clinician to affix, as well as being simple and cost
      effective to manufacture and use.

 10                                    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
     [0012] Various apparatus and methods are provided for interfacing an ophthalmic surgical laser
     with an eye using a patient interface. The interface may include a closed, fluid-filled bladder
     having fiducials that contacts and deforms to the eye. Alternatively, the interface may have an
     applanation lens with an outer ring portion and an inner concave portion for receiving the apex
15   of the cornea. A suction ring with a flexible skirt may be used to contact the sclera that is non
    circular and/or non-planar. In one version, a lens cone may be co-molded with the attachment
    ring, with a lens window at the bottom of the lens cone which providing a sealed volume for
    vacuum-attaching a laser delivery system above the lens cone.
     [0013] According to the first embodiment, a patient interface for coupling a patient's eye to an
20  ophthalmic surgical laser system comprises a fluid-filled bladder of a flexible material attached
    to a lower end of a lens cone that is adapted to couple to an ophthalmic laser delivery system.
    The bladder contains a fixed volume of fluid and has sufficient flexibility to deform upon
    contact with a patient's eye so as to conform to the cornea. The bladder may define an upper
                                                       -5-

      1002156133
     tubular collar and a lower dome-shaped contact portion, wherein the upper collar attaches to a
     lower ring of the lens cone. The bladder desirably has a wall thickness of between about 25-250
     pm, and a refractive index (RI) that is within the range of about 1.35-1.41. To help keep track of
     patient movement, fiducial markings may be provided on the exterior of the bladder which
  5  conform to the cornea when the bladder deforms. For instance, the fiducial markings are lines
     parallel to the axis of the bladder and lens cone and spaced 90' around the bladder.
     [0014] In another aspect of the present application, a patient interface for coupling a patient's
     eye to an ophthalmic surgical laser system comprises an attachment ring configured to overlay
     an anterior surface of the eye.     The attachment ring has a rigid annular housing defining an
 10  opening and across which an applanation lens is fixed. The applanation lens has a lower surface
     defined by an outer ring portion and an inner concave portion shaped to receive the apex of the
     cornea of the patient's eye when the attachment ring is lowered toward the eye. A boundary
    between the outer ring portion and the inner concave portion of the lower surface of the
    applanation lens is preferably a sharp corner. A suction ring may be mounted within the annular
15  housing with downwardly projecting flexible rings for contacting the eye and defining a suction
    channel therebetween so as to hold the attachment ring to a patient's eye during ophthalmic
    surgery. The annular housing and suction ring align along a central axis, and an outer one of the
    flexible rings may define an eye contact surface that is not perpendicular to the central axis. A
    fluid port may be provided in the annular housing for injection of an index matching fluid above
20  the eye. In one version, a strain relief extension projects radially outward from the annular body
    on a side of the annular housing on which is located the suction port, and has an aperture for
    passage of a vacuum tube that connects to the suction port. Furthermore, the applanation lens
    may be molded together with the rigid annular housing.

      eye to a surgical laser system, the patient interface comprising: an attachment ring disposed
      around a central axis configured to overlay an anterior surface of the eye, the attachment ring
      having a pair of concentric downwardly projecting flexible rings for contacting the eye and
  5   defining a channel therebetween and a suction port in communication with the channel, wherein
     an outer one of the flexible rings defines an eye contact surface that is not perpendicular to the
     central axis.
      [0015] The patient interfaces herein may include an attachment ring having a pair of concentric
     downwardly projecting flexible        rings for contacting the eye and defining a channel
 10  therebetween, wherein an outer one of the flexible rings defines an eye contact surface that is not
     perpendicular to the central axis. At the same time, the inner flexible ring defines an eye contact
     surface that is perpendicular to the central axis. Moreover, the outer flexible ring may define an
     elliptical eye contact surface, and the inner flexible ring defines a circular eye contact surface.
     [0016] Another patient interface described herein includes an integral lens cone and attachment
15  ring disposed around a central axis, the attachment ring having a pair of concentric downwardly
    projecting flexible rings for contacting the eye and defining a channel therebetween and a
    suction port in communication with the channel. The lens cone includes a lens window fixed
    across a lower end above the attachment ring. The lens window may be co-molded with the lens
    cone of a transparent polymer. Fluid injection ports may be distributed around the integral lens
20  cone and attachment ring for injecting an index matching fluid above the flexible rings and
    below the lens window. Furthermore, an optics ring vacuum may be provided that is sealed to a
    top end of the lens cone.

     [0017] A method of preparing a surgical laser system for ophthalmic surgery as described herein
     includes lowering a fluid-filled bladder of a flexible material attached to a lower end of a lens
     cone to a patient's eye.    The bladder contains a fixed volume of fluid and has sufficient
     flexibility to deform upon contact with a patient's eye so as to conform to the cornea. The
  5  bladder has a closed volume which does not require filling with fluid. The method includes
     coupling the lens cone to a laser delivery system. The laser delivery system preferably includes
    an optical tracking system, wherein the method involves registering the tracking system to a
    plurality of fiducial markings provided on the exterior of the bladder. In one embodiment, the
    fiducial markings are lines parallel to the axis of the bladder and lens cone and spaced 90'
 10 around the bladder.

10                DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFFERED EMBODIMENTS
   [0035] Embodiments of this invention is directed to a mechanical apparatus that performs the
   functions of coupling the anterior surface of a target eye to a surgical laser and stabilizing the
   eye. The apparatus couples the surface of an operative target, such as human corneal tissue, to a
   mechanical fixture of a surgical laser system, such as the distal tip of a laser beam's delivery
15 system.     In the context of a particular embodiment which will be described in greater detail
   below, the apparatus is affixed both to the anterior surface of a human eye and to the laser
   delivery system.
   [0036] Referring initially to the exemplary embodiment of Figure 1, an exemplary ocular
   stabilization system of the prior art is shown in an exploded, perspective view, and is generally
20 indicated at 10. The description herein of new and improved devices for stabilizing an eye for
   surgery will be used in the context of the prior art system 10, and thus an overview is
   appropriate.     The eye is shown below the stabilization system 10 having a cornea C and a
   surrounding sclera S.
                                                     -10-

    1002156133
    [0037] The ocular stabilization system 10 (also referred to as a patient interface) is an apparatus
    that attaches to a human eye and desirably holds (fixes) the eye in all three axes (x, y and z) from
    translational and rotational movement with respect to the incident beam of a laser surgical
    device, or at least stabilizes the eye to enable easy tracking thereof.        In the prior art, the
 5  stabilization system allows for the cornea of the eye to be applanated by a planar lens (laser
    optic) during a laser surgical procedure, so as to minimize motion of the human eye with respect
   to the laser optical path.
    [00381 With reference still to Figure 1, the prior stabilization system 10 comprises an ocular
    attachment ring 12 that couples to the eye, a gripper device 14, a lens cone 16 and an applanation
10  lens 18 which, in combination with the lens cone 16, is used to establish an appropriate optical
   path alignment between the cornea and a laser optical path.
    [0039] A lower edge of the attachment ring 12 is typically constructed of a flexible,
   hypoallergenic material such as rubber, hypoallergenic plastic, silicone, or the like. The ring 12
   is substantially annular in shape, having a generally smooth exterior surface and a highly
15 articulated and functional inner surface, as will be described in greater detail below.         Being
   annular in shape, the attachment ring 12 necessarily defines an outer diameter (OD) and inner
   diameter (ID), with the inner diameter circumscribing a central target opening 13.
    [0040] The gripper device 14 functions much like a clothes pin, and is constructed with an upper
   gripper portion 19 overlaying a receiver portion 20 designed to receive and contain the
20 attachment ring 12 within the lower portion of a central opening 21 through the gripper device.
   The gripper portion 19 has two lever handles 22 and 24 separated by a closure spacing 25, and
   two jaws 26 and 27 surrounding the central opening 21.        As the lever handles 22 and 24 are
   squeezed together, the closure spacing 25 closes and a deformation force is transmitted to the
                                                    -11-

    1002156133
   jaws 26 and 27 causing them to widen sufficiently for a cylindrical object to be inserted into the
   now-widened central opening 21.
    [0041] The attachment ring 12 is disposed and retained within an appropriately shaped
   receptacle provided in the underside of the gripper device 14. Since the attachment ring 12 is
 5 constructed of a flexible material, the receptacle of the gripper device 14 need only have an ID
   of a dimension slightly smaller than the OD of the attachment ring, such that the attachment ring
   may fit within the receptacle and be held in place by compressive force.         This allows the
   attachment ring 12 to be maintained within the central opening 21 of the receiver portion 20,
   when the jaws 26 and 27 are opened.          The jaws 26 and 27 may subsequently be opened to
10 receive a lower apex ring 30 of the lens cone 16 without disturbing or displacing the attachment
   ring.
    [0042] In this regard, and in connection with Figures 2 and 3A, the lens cone 16 is suitably
   constructed as an open-sided truncated cone-like structure, with an upper open, annular base ring
   28 affixed to the open, cylindrical apex ring 30 by a set of support struts 32 which extend
15 between the base ring 28 and the apex ring 30. The base ring 28 is larger than the apex ring 30
   thereby giving the lens cone 16 its characteristic truncated cone-like shape.      The base ring
   portion 28 affixes to the distal end of a laser optical delivery system.
   [00431 As seen in Figures 3A and 3B, the apex ring 30 defines a receptacle for receiving and
   retaining the applanation lens 18. The apex ring 30 surrounds and retains the applanation lens
20 18 which is typically bonded into place forming a generally unitary structure with the lens cone
   16. The applanation lens 18 is formed with an anterior surface 64 and an applanation surface 66.
   Both the anterior surface 64 and the applanation surface 66 may be flat and substantially parallel
   to one another, or concave toward the eye and also parallel to one another. The applanation lens
                                                    -12-

    1002156133
    18 is suitably constructed from a quartz silicate glass or an optical quality plastic chosen for its
   transmission characteristics of light at the particular wavelength delivered by the laser system
   under consideration.      Although such an applanation lens provides good stabilization, the
   boundary between the lens and the eye creates an optical discontinuity which affects the
 5 accuracy of the laser during surgery, especially for surgeries on the deeper structures within the
   eye, such as laser cataract surgery.
   [00441 Figure 3B show a portion of the ocular stabilization system 10 in cross-sectional form as
   it would be attached to a human eye 34. The lens cone 16 is coupled to the attachment ring 12,
   thereby coupling a patient's eye 34 to the laser delivery system, by interfacing the two structures
10 together by the gripper device 14. As the apex ring 30 is inserted into the central opening 21 of
   the gripper device 14, the applanation surface 66 of the applanation lens 18 makes contact with a
   presented portion of the anterior surface of the cornea C. As the lens cone 16 is lowered into
   proximity with the cornea, the applanation surface 66 makes contact with and applies pressure to
   the cornea C such that when the lens cone is lowered into position, the corneal anterior surface
15 34b and the applanation surface 66 of the lens are in intimate contact with one another over a
   substantial portion of the applanation surface.
   [0045] The cylindrical apex ring 30 comprises an inner diameter (ID) and an outer diameter
   (OD), wherein the OD is dimensioned such that it is only slightly larger than the ID of the
   central opening 21 of the gripper portion 19 of the gripper device 14.         The lens cone 16 is
20 constructed of a substantially rigid material such as a rigid, extruded plastic, aluminum, or the
   like, such that the OD of the apex ring 30 does not deform under the pressure applied by the jaws
   26 and 27 of the gripper portion 19. Accordingly, the apex ring 30 does not initially fit into the
   ID of the central opening 21 of the gripper device 14. Compressive force applied to the lever
                                                   -13-

    1002156133
   handles 22 and 24 causes the jaws 26 and 27 to open and the interior diameter of central opening
    21 to increase such that OD of the apex ring 30 may be inserted into the central opening 21 of
   the gripper device 14. When pressure is released on the lever handles 22 and 24, the jaws 26 and
   27 close upon the apex ring 30 thereby establishing a fixed relationship between the lens cone 16
 5 and the gripper device 14.     Since the gripper device 14 is in geometric engagement with the
   attachment ring 12, and since the attachment ring 12 is coupled to corneal tissue, it should be
   understood that the lens cone 16 is now held in a particular spatial relationship (alignment) with
   the surface of the cornea.
    [00461 With reference still to Figure 3B, the attachment ring 12 provides a primary interface
10 with the corneal portion C of a human eye 34 and a laser delivery system. The attachment ring
    12 includes a soft annular member 35 having a lower skirt 36 which functions as a shroud that
   comes into intimate contact with the anterior portion of the human eye 34. The shroud 36 has a
   relatively thin cross-section and is deformable (e.g., silicone) so as to establish and maintain
   conformal contact with the anterior corneal surface C.         The annular member 35 extends
15 upwardly from the skirt portion 36 and fits closely with any downward-opening channel formed
   partly by an outer wall 38 in the receiver portion 20. The close fit of the annular member 35 in
   the channel maintains a substantially uniform ID against deformations of the lower shroud
   portion 36 in response to pressure against the shroud portion by the human eye 34.
   [0047] The attachment ring 12 further includes an interior, annular ring member 40 which
20 protrudes inwardly toward the target opening 13 (Figure 1). The annular ring member 40 has a
   bottom surface that defines a downwardly-opening cavity 42 within the periphery of the skirt
   portion 36. The attachment ring 12 further includes an attachment fitting 44 extending radially
   outward. The attachment fitting 44 includes a central orifice 46, disposed along its entire length,
                                                   -14-

      1002156133
     and which passes through the material of the attachment ring's skirt portion 36 (not shown) such
     that a communication path is opened between the annular channel 42, at one end, and the distal
     end of the attachment fitting 44.       As seen in Figure 1, the attachment fitting 44 might be
     accessed by inserting one side of a male-to-male fitting coupler 45 into the central orifice 46 and
  5  coupling the other side to a length of small diameter, medical grade tubing. The tubing is then
     coupled to a vacuum source which, in turn, is then able to apply a vacuum to the annular channel
     42.
     [00481 With reference still to Figure 3B, the applanation surface 66 provides a reference surface
    from which the laser system is able to compute a depth of focus characteristic. In embodiments
 10 where the applanation surface 66 contacts the corneal surface, as shown, the position of the
    applanated corneal surface C with respect to the laser delivery tip is known from the known
    position of the applanation surface. It is, therefore, a relatively straightforward matter to focus a
    laser beam to any point within the cornea.
    [00491 In other embodiments, tomography techniques (e.g., optical coherence tomography) or
15  other ranging technology can be used to determine the relative location and position of various
    ocular structures, including the anterior corneal surface, the various corneal layers (e.g.,
    epithelium, endothelium, Descemet's membrane, stroma, and Bowman's layer), the capsular
    bag, the lens, the retina, and the like. Using tomography or other ranging techniques, the relative
    location and position of the laser delivery tip with respect to such structures can be determined
20  and thus, the depth of the laser beam can be determined and calibrated into acceptable tolerances
    equivalent to the aforementioned tolerances for alignment or tolerances associated with
    conventional microkeratomes.          In such embodiments, the tolerances associated with the
                                                     -15-

    1002156133
    dimensions of the lens cone, alignment of the applanation lens, and the like, may have greater
    acceptable ranges.
    [0050 In operation, the attachment ring 12 is placed around the limbus of a patient's eye 34,
    such that its lower, skirt portion 36 surrounds the anterior surface of the cornea 34a, thereby
 5  leaving free optical access to the cornea 34a. In other embodiments, the attachment ring 12 has
   an ID of a dimension that permits placement of the attachment ring 12 around a portion of the
   sclera of a patient's eye 34. A slight compressive force is applied to the attachment ring 12,
   thereby deforming the skirt portion 36 in an outwardly direction, such that it tends to conform to
   the shape of the corneal surface. A slight vacuum is developed by a vacuum source or suction
10 pump and coupled to the attachment ring 12 through the attachment fitting 44. As suction is
   applied to the attachment fitting 44, its internal orifice 46 couples the suction to the annular
   channel 42 which is now sealed-off from the external ambient environment by corneal, limbal,
   or scleral contact.
   [0051] With the eye so presented and held in place by the attachment ring 12, the lens cone 16
15 and applanation lens 18 can be lowered into proximity or actual contact with the cornea, and
   retain the lens cone, and particularly the applanation lens, in position by fixing the apex ring 30
   with the gripper device 14. The gripper device 14 is opened to receive the lens cone 16 which is
   then lowered into the attachment ring 12.         The gripper device 14 is then closed, thereby
   clamping the lens cone 16 in position and fixing the applanation lens 18 relative to the cornea.
20 [00521 As should be understood from the foregoing, and with respect to the exemplary
   embodiments, the stabilization system is substantially rigidly coupled to the laser delivery
   system, thus the plane of the applanation surface 66 is characterizable in space with respect to
   any given focal point of an incident laser beam. With regard to the eye, it should be understood
                                                   -16-

     1002156133
     that the lens 18 is able to be positioned in the "z" direction due to the flexibility of the skirt
     portion 36 of the attachment ring when the ring is opened. The applanation lens 18 is therefore
     able to accommodate variously shaped corneal surfaces without placing undue pressure on the
     eye and achieve a variable degree of flattening of the cornea. The applanation lens 18 is thusly
  5  secured against motion and is accurately disposed in a stable "x-y-z" plane with respect to the
    eye.
     [0053] Ophthalmic Surgery Patient Interface with Fluid-Filled Applanation Bladder
     [00541 In addition to the optical discontinuity created by contact between the applanation
 10 surface 66 and the cornea, other problems with direct contact applanation lenses include
    increased intraocular pressure from the suction ring and downward pressure on the eye by the
    applanation lens 18, corneal wrinkles from flat or curved applanation lenses when the corneal
    curvature is not well matched with the applanating cone, and the need to physically dock with
    the eye. Consequently, the present application provides several solutions which address one or
15  more of these drawbacks.
    [0055] In a first embodiment, a patient interface 100 seen in Figures 4-5 utilizes a compliant
    liquid-filled bladder 102 attached to the lower apex ring 104 of a lens cone 106. The bladder
    102 directly contacts the eye 108, as seen in Figure 5, and provides some stability thereto during
    ophthalmic laser surgery. As seen in Figure 4A, the bladder 102 is desirably made from a thin,
20  compliant plastic or silicone material having an upper tubular collar 110 and a lower dome
    shaped contact portion 112. The collar 110 is held on the exterior of the apex ring 104, such as
    by adhesives or mechanical clamping (not shown) creating a sealed volume above the bladder
    and below a lens cone glass surface 114.
                                                   -17-

      1002156133
      [0056] The volume within the bladder 102 is partially filled with a transparent fluid having an
     optical refractive index (RI) that is close to or equal to the RI of the cornea. This RI matching
     reduces optical distortion     experienced by the       laser beam when passing through the
     bladder/cornea interface. In one embodiment, the bladder 102 is filled with 0.5 mL transparent
  5  solution at atmospheric pressure. The transparent solution can be water, a balanced salt solution,
     an ophthalmic viscoelastic, or other optically suitable solution. The refractive index RI (or index
     of refraction) of a medium is a dimensionless number that describes how light propagates
     through it. RI is defined as
     [0057] RI =   C/V,
 10  [0058] where c is the speed of light in vacuum and v is the speed of light in the medium. For
     example, the RI of water is 1.33, meaning that light travels 1.33 times as fast in vacuum as it
     does in water. In most studies, the aqueous and vitreous humors both have a refractive index of
     1.336-1.339, whereas the cornea has an RI of 1.376-1.41.            Glass, used typically for the
    applanation lenses described above, has an RI of between about 1.5-1.6. Flexible materials such
15  as silicone that may be used for the bladder 102 typically have RIs of greater than 1.4.
     [00591 An example of a material potentially usable as a suitable bladder material is a
    fluoropolymer called THV (Tetrafluoroethylene hexafluoropropylene             vinylidene fluoride),
    whose refractive index is 1.35. Other materials such as silicone rubber whose refractive index is
    approximately 1.40 may be used.           Alternatively, a medical grade, flexible, elastic, clear
20  polyurethane may be used. The material preferably has a refractive index that is as close as
    possible to the RI of the cornea, and thus is preferably between about 1.35-1.41. The RI of the
    transparent solution within the bladder is between about 1.33-1.41. For instance, the RI of three
                                                     -18-

    1002156133
    readily available contact lens solutions, AMO LENS PLUSTM OcuPureTM, BAUSCH & LOMB
    Sensitive Eyes T M Plus Saline Solution, and Sauflon saline, are 1.3347, 1.3348 and 1.3348,
    respectively.
    [00601 The wall thickness of the dome-shaped portion 112 of the bladder 102 is desirably
 5  extremely small to further minimize any optical distortion from the laser beam passing through.
    In one embodiment, the wall thickness of the dome-shaped portion 112 is between about 25-250
    ptm, more preferably between about 25-100 [tm or even more particularly 38-75 ptm. In terms of
    candidate materials, if a fluoropolymer such as THV is used the wall thickness of the dome
    shaped portion 112 is desirably between about 25-75 pim, and if a polyurethane is used the
10 thickness will desirably be either I mil (25 microns) or 1.5 mil (38 microns).
    [0061] The patient interface 100 having the fluid-filled bladder 102 does not require a
   surrounding suction ring, as described above, so the working diameter defined by the surface
   area of the bladder in contact with the eye may be increased outward past the cornea to the
   limbus, or further. In use, the surgeon lowers the patient interface 100 onto the eye until the
15 bladder 102 deforms.     Further advancement conforms the bladder 102 to the contours of the
   cornea and lids.    Any pressures generated against the eye are distributed across all surfaces
   (cornea and lids), thus reducing intraocular pressure increases and corneal wrinkles as compared
   to an applanation lens as described above.
   [0062] In a preferred embodiment, fiducial markings 120 are provided on the exterior surface of
20 the bladder 102 to serve as targets for eye tracking systems, such as a CCD based video system.
   For example, four evenly spaced vertical markings 120 may be provided on the exterior of the
   bladder 102 within both the tubular collar 110 and dome-shaped contact portion 112.         The
                                                   -19-

     1002156133
     fiducial markings 120 are sufficiently low down on the bladder 102 so as to conform to the
     cornea when the bladder deforms, thus presenting more horizontal "cross-hairs" for a tracking
     system.   This provides quadrant markings for the tracking system.       If the eye moves during
     surgery, the quadrant markings 120 also move, which allows the tracking system to
  5  accommodate the movement and readjust the aim of the laser. The markings 120 may be etched
     into the exterior surface of the bladder 102, or maybe printed thereon. The fiducial markings
     120 are more distinct and predictable than the eye's natural features, thus requiring less complex
     image processing algorithms and translating into lower equipment and bill of materials cost.
     [00631 In a preferred embodiment, the bladder 102 is attached to the patient interface lens cone
 10  106 as shown. Alternatively, the bladder 102 is constructed as a separate part, independent of
    the patient interface lens cone 106, sandwiched between the eye and the apex ring 104 of the
    lens cone. In the latter configuration, the bladder 102 will be placed on the cornea just prior to
    lowering the lens cone 106 for applanation.
    [00641 Ophthalmic Surgery Patient Interface with Plano-Concave Applanation Lens
15  [0065] Figures 6-10 illustrate a second embodiment of a patient interface for ophthalmic laser
    surgery including a modified receiver portion 150 and attachment ring 152. The receiver portion
    150 is relatively rigid, while the attachment ring 152 is soft and flexible. The attachment ring
    152 is similar to the attachment ring 12 described above for the prior art system 10 and provides
    a vacuum seal against the eye.
20  [00661 As seen in the exploded view of Figure 6 and also with reference to the sectional view in
    Figure 8, the receiver portion 150 includes an upper housing 160 having a downwardly opening
    channel 162 that receives therein an annular portion 164 of the attachment ring 152. The ring
                                                   -20-

      1002156133
      152 includes an outer skirt 166 and an inner ring member 168, with an annular vacuum manifold
      170 therebetween. The manifold 170 opens to passages that lead to a vacuum port 172. As seen
     in Figure 10, lowering the attachment ring 152 to the surface of the eye causes the skirt 166 and
     ring member 162 form a seal around the annular manifold 170, such that a vacuum pulled
  5  through the port 172 affixes the structure to the eye.
     [0067] The receiver portion 150 and attachment ring 152 provide an interface between the eye
     and a laser delivery system, which may be mounted to an upper end of a lens cone as described
     above. The patient interface further includes a modified applanation lens 178 that contacts the
     eye and through which the laser passes.
 10  [00681 The applanation lens 178 shown in diametric section in Figure 8 includes a planar upper
     surface 180, and a lower surface having a planar outer ring 182 and a concave inner recess 184.
     The inner recess 184 receives the apex of the cornea and the applanation lens 178 is in contact
    with the eye. Although the transition between the outer ring 182 and inner recess 184 is shown
    distinctly as an abrupt corner, it may be rounded to reduce any optical artifacts. The presence of
15  the inner recess 184 aids in fixing the corneal surface during laser surgery without unduly
    increasingly intraocular pressure in the eyeball.       The combination of both flat and concave
    surfaces tried to better fit the range of patients while still providing enough depth registration to
    ensure proper laser treatments.
    [0069] The applanation lens 178 may be a separate element held or adhered into the rigid
20  housing 160 of the receiver portion 150, or it may be molded with the housing 160 as shown. In
    the former case, the materials may vary from glass to polymer, preferably an acrylic similar to
    contact lens materials.    If the applanation lens 178 is molded into the housing 160 as single
                                                      -21-

     1002156133
    piece, as shown, the material is preferably acrylic with as close a refractive index (RI) to the
    corneal RI as possible.
     10070] Figure 9 shows the inner recess 184 as a partial sphere, although other curvatures such as
    partial ellipsoids or variable axis curves are contemplated.
 5  [00711 Any mismatch between the surfaces of the applanation lens 178 and the patient's cornea
    or sclera will be filled with an index matching liquid to ensure the optical path is as consistent as
    possible to produce proper focal volumes of laser radiation.
    [00721 Figure 10 illustrates the applanation lens 178 in contact with a corneal surface C of an
    eye, with an index matching liquid 190 provided in the volume underneath the lens not in
10  contact with the eye.     As before, the attachment ring 152 provides the soft sealing skirt and
    vacuum manifold therein for securing the ring to the eye. The index matching liquid 190 fills
   the space above the sealing skirt had outside of the inner recess 184.        In one embodiment, a
   liquid filling port 192 is provided in the attachment ring housing 160 leading to internal channels
   and eventually the volume under the applanation lens 178 and surrounding the eye.
15  [0073] Trading the larger flat or concave applanation lens of the prior art with the applanation
   lens 178 having a planar-concave lower surface provides only partial contact and compression of
   the eye, which results in a number of benefits. Since intimate contact between the applanation
   lens 178 over the entire corneal surface does not occur, a method to determine the location of the
   corneal surface or deeper surfaces will be needed in order to reliably focus the laser energy to
20 the proper location.     For example, optical coherence tomography or some other range finding
   system will be utilized. Furthermore, by registering only a portion of the corneal surface against
                                                     -22-

     1002156133
     the lower surface of the applanation lens 178, heart beat pulsations transmitted through the eye
     will be lessened for more stability and thus better surgical outcomes.
     [00741 Depending on the diameter of the inner recess 182 and its curvature, the volume of the
     eye that is compressed and varies. In general, as the diameter of the inner recess 182 increases
  5  the volume increases. Likewise, as the radius of concave curvature of the recess 182 increases
    the recess becomes flatter and generally the volume compressed increases.               The partial
     applanation provided by the lens 178 provides positional stability so the surgeon can do
     intrastromal arcuate incisions with no need of real-time tracking of the cornea position.
     [0075] It should be noted that although the outer ring 182 of the lower surface of the applanation
 10 lens 178 is shown and described as planar, other configurations are possible. For example, the
    outer ring 182 may be concave or even convex, depending on the requirements of the optical
    system.
    [0076] Ophthalmic Surgery Patient Interface with Non-Circular Suction Ring
    [0077] Often when fixing laser surgery devices to the eye, the intraocular pressure builds up
15  from pressing down on the eye with the suction ring. Such suction rings are uniformly circular,
    although the limbal or scleral surfaces of the eye are not quite spherical. This mismatch often
    results in multiple attempts at docking the vacuum ring, and deformation of the eyeball in order
    to fit the circular ring to it. Distortion of the eyeball adds to intraocular pressure, and also
    increases the likelihood of failure of the suction ring during use of the device. Furthermore,
20  certain eyes such as those having astigmatism, are less than spherical in shape and thus present
    difficulties for circular sealing rings.

     [00781 Figure 11 is a schematic view of an eye showing the profile of the nose and orthogonal
     planes intersecting along the optical axis through the eye.      Outer portions of the four planes
     indicate the conventional meridian directions used for geometric orientation to describe parts of
     the eye. In the horizontal plane, the nasal direction (N) is toward the nose (seen in profile) while
  5  the temporal (T) direction is to the outside. As usual, superior (S) is up and inferior (I) is down.
     Figure 1 IA indicates the same meridian directions looking straight along the optical axis and
     also showing the intermediate azimuth planes (NS, NI, TI, TS) rotated 450 from the primary
     planes.
     [0079] With reference again to Figure 11, a first topographical line 200 is drawn on the eye and
 10  generally indicates the center of the limbal region. The line 200 represents the intersection of
    the surface of the eyeball with an infinite number of planes around the azimuth through the
    optical axis similar to the orthogonal planes show. The line 200 is drawn at a certain diameter
    outward from the optical axis. A second topographical line 202 drawn on the eye generally
    indicates the beginning of the scleral region, or at least a contact location within the scleral
 15 region for the outer skirt of a suction ring of a patient interface. The location of the limbal and
    scleral regions radially outward from the optical axis are determined from an average population.
    Again, the line 202 represents the intersection of the surface of the eyeball with an infinite
    number of planes through the optical axis similar to the orthogonal planes shown, and again at a
    certain diameter outward from the optical axis. Measurements of the tangent angles (to the eye
20  surface) at the lines 200, 202 reveal that the eyeball in the limbal and scleral regions is not a
    perfect sphere. In general, the first topographical line 200 in the limbal region is more planar
    than the second topographical line 202 in the scleral region, and the tangent angles on the nasal
    side have a measurably lesser slope as compared to the temporal side. That is, with reference to
                                                     -24-

    1002156133
    Figure 11 A, the tangent angles measured at N, NS, and NI in the scleral region were statistically
    less than those measured on the temporal side, which were essentially equal around I-TI-T-TS-S.
    Additionally, the tangent angles measured in the limbal region were statistically equal around the
    entire eye.
  5  [0080] Consequently, one solution to the mismatch between current circular suction rings and
    non-spherical eyeballs is illustrated in Figures 12A-12D which shows a patient interface 210 in
    which at least a portion of the suction ring is non-circular and/or non-planar.        The patient
    interface 210 includes a generally annular body 212 which may have internal features such as
    tabs 214 (or threads) for connecting to a lens cone, such as those described earlier. On the lower
 [0 end of the housing, the patient interface 210 has an outer skirt 220 separated from an inner ring
    222 by a suction channel 224. As seen in the sectional view of Figure 12D, a suction port 226 is
    shown that leads to internal passages in communication with the suction channel 224. The
    patient interface 210 functions in a similar manner as those described above, with the outer skirt
    220 and inner ring 222 sealing against the surface of the eyeball such that a negative pressure
 15 can be formed therebetween by applying a vacuum to the suction port 226. A flexible tube (not
    shown) attached to the suction port 226 desirably passes through an aperture 230 of a strain
    relief extension 232 projecting radially outward from the annular body 212.
    [0081] Figure 12B shows the patient interface 210 from the side. Because of the outwardly
    projecting strain relief extension 232 and attached vacuum tube (not shown), the right side in
20  Figure 12B would be positioned to the temporal side of the patient, with the left side
    corresponding to the nasal side.      This configuration can be used on either eye by simply
    reorienting by 1800 the patient interface 210.

     [0082] The angle 0 indicates material removed from the lower edge of the outer skirt 220 of the
     sealing apparatus. In one embodiment, the angle 0 is less than 2', more preferably less than 1,
    and in one exemplary embodiment is 0.730. The material removed may result in a planar surface
     defined by the lower edge of the outer skirt 220, or a non-planar surface.       In an exemplary
  5 embodiment, the lower edge of the outer skirt 220 defines a plane at the angle 0. Looking from
    the bottom of the patient interface 210 at the slight angle 0, as in Figure 12C, the periphery of
    the outer skirt 220 defines an ellipse with a major axis generally aligned in the nasal-temporal
    (N-T) direction, and the minor axis perpendicular thereto, or in the superior-inferior (S-I) plane.
    This is because the annular body 212 and outer skirt 220 are annular, and cutting across a tube
 10 with an angled plane creates an ellipse. This non-circular shape better fits the actual shape of the
    eyeball, and thus helps ensure quicker and more secure engagement of the patient interface 210
    therewith.
     [0083] Figure 12D illustrates several angles drawn tangent to the curve lower edges of the outer
    skirt 220 and inner ring 222. More particularly, an angle a and an angle     P both lie in the nasal
 15 temporal plane, with the former on the nasal (N) side and the latter on the temporal (T) side.
    Because material has been removed from the nasal (left) side of the skirt 220, a < P. More such
    angles tangent to both the outer skirt 220 and inner ring 222 can be drawn around the azimuth
    which will be in between these two extremes. For example, angles adjacent to the angle a on
    the nasal side and continuing toward the temporal side will gradually increase until they equal
20  the angle P. Or, as mentioned above, the change in the angles drawn between the outer skirt 220
    and inner ring 222 may change non-linearly.
                                                   -26-

     1002156133
     [0084] Since the outer skirt 220 typically contacts the eyeball in the scleral region, material is
    removed to make it non-planar and ellipsoid so as to better fit the measured topography of the
    scleral region. On the other hand, the inner ring 222 contacts the eyeball in the limbal region,
    which having a relatively planar and circular topography, and so the inner ring 222 remains
  5 planar, horizontal and thus circular on its lower edge. Thus the patient interface 210 annular
    suction region is bounded by the inner ring 222 which is essentially circular and the outer ring
    220 which is slightly elliptical.
    [00851 Looked at another way, the lower edges of the outer skirt 220 and inner ring 222 are
    desirably shaped to conform to the actual shape of an eyeball based on empirical measurements.
 t0 This means that the scleral region on the nasal side has a shallower angle, and for a given radial
    distance outward from the optical axis it will be axially closer to the apex of the cornea than will
    a point in the scleral region on the temporal side. Therefore the material on the nasal side of the
    skirt 220 is removed. As the patient interface 210 is lowered onto the eyeball with its own axis
    coincident with the optical axis, both the nasal and temporal sides of the outer skirt 220 will
  5 contact the eyeball the same time, in the ideal situation. Of course, the empirical measurements
    represent an average across a population, and there may be some variance between patients, but
    the overall outcome is a better fit to the average eye.
    [0086] Figure 13 is a perspective view of an integrated patient interface system 250 above an
    eye 252, while Figure 13A is a longitudinal sectional view with a vacuum tube 254 removed.
20  The system 250 combines the aspects of the sealing ring with the lens cone, the latter also being
    integrated with the delivery optics. In an overview, a lens cone 260 couples to the bottom end of
    an optics ring 262, and incorporates a sealing ring 264 on its lower end. The sealing ring
    includes a vacuum port 266, such as those described above, for connection of the vacuum tube
                                                     -27-

    254. As seen best in the sectional view of Figure 13A, the combined lens cone 260 and sealing
    ring 264 provide one or more fluid inlets 270 through which an index matching medium can be
    introduced, such as with a handheld bottle 272.
     [00871 As seen best in Figure 14, the lower end of the sealing ring 264 includes a pair of flexible
  5 skirts or rings 274 between which is an annular channel (not numbered) in communication with
    the vacuum port 266. The sealing ring 264 functions similar to those described above, and thus
    secures the patient interface system 250 to the eye 252 when suction is pulled through the
    vacuum tube 254 and port 266. In a preferred embodiment, a housing of the sealing ring 264 is
    co-molded of a rigid polymer with the lens cone 260, and the lower skirts 274 are formed by a
 [0 soft separate piece that is fitted to a recess in the housing. Alternatively, a solid sealing surface
    may be substituted.
     [0088] The optics ring 262 includes a lower seal 280 that mates with an outward flange ring 282
    of the lens cone 260. The lower end of the lens cone 260 is closed by a lens window 284.
    Although not shown, an upper end of the optics ring 262 will be sealed such that suction pulled
 15 through a vacuum port 286 secures the optics ring to the top of the lens cone 260. This provides
    a large coupling force for relatively small vacuum pressure due to the large effective seal area.
    Although shown schematically, optics 288 protrude downward into the lens cone 260. With
    reference again to Figures 13A and 14, the fluid inlet(s) 270 molded into the lens cone 260
    assembly allow liquid entry below the lens window 284 and above the eye 252.
20   100891 There are two possible configurations for the lens cones described herein; either there is a
    "permanent cone" that is part of the laser delivery system, or the cone is part of the disposable
    patient interface.
                                                       -28-

     1002156133
     [00901 In a preferred embodiment, the assembly of the lens cone 260 and sealing ring 264 is
     made of a disposable rigid plastic. Desirably, the material is optically clear so that the lens
    window 284 can be molded at the same time. In the earlier embodiments, the lens cone was
    made separate from the sealing ring, with the sealing ring containing an applanation lens or other
  5  such lens window. Therefore, the separate sealing ring was the part that contacts the patient, and
    thus was disposable. However, the patient interface system 250 reduces the number of steps
    required to assemble for surgery,
     [0091] For a "permanent cone," the disposable patient interface would just have to attach to it,
    either with a twist-lock, a thread, suction, magnets, clamps, or some other mechanical means,
 10 such as shown below in Figures 15A and 15B. The disposable patient interface would have to
    have the lens window as a part of it, to maintain sterility and disposability. Further, there would
    need to be a way to get liquid into the space directly above the eye and below the window, either
    via a port or a channel.
    [0092] Alternately the cone is integrated with the disposable patient interface, and the conical
 15 part exists only to allow attachment someplace above the lowest optical element. This is the
    embodiment shown above in Figures 13-14. The cone shape is not necessary, and the shape
    could be cylindrical or otherwise to allow attachment to the laser delivery system, either at
    predetermined locations (clocked) or in an orientation selectable by the user. The cone would be
    attached to the laser system either with a twist-lock, a thread, suction, magnets, clamps, or some
20  other mechanical means. Again, there would have to be a system for injecting liquid in the
    region under the window and above the eye.
    [0093] In all these designs the patient interface grips securely onto the eye with some suction
    element in order to secure the eye and prohibit it from movement. Alternatively, a coffer dam
                                                    -29-

     1002156133
     could be used which makes contact with the eye and contains the liquid. If means to track the
    eye movement is includes then suction might not be necessary, but tracking systems add
    complexity and cost to the system.
     [0094] Figures 15A and 15B are perspective views of two different disposable attachment rings
  5 300, 302 coupling with the lens cones described herein. The first attachment ring shows a recess
    304 for receiving the lower end of the lens cone, and has an inwardly projecting tab 306
    mirrored by a second opposite tab (not shown). The tabs 306 are used to engage bayonet-type
    channels or other such locking structure.    Furthermore, the ring 300 features a plurality of
    generally axially-oriented notches 308 which provide passages for manually injecting an index
 [0 matching medium above the sealing rings and eye, but below a lens window. The lens window
    (not shown) is desirably held in an upper part of the attachment ring recess 304 and is thus
    disposable therewith.
    {00951 The attachment ring 302 in Figure 15B includes a 2-start thread 310 to enable it be
    screwed onto a permanent feature on a lens cone. An inlet port 312 permits liquid to be injected
 15 through a port parallel to the vacuum port.
    [0096] It should be understood that individual components of the various patient interfaces
    described herein may be combined with other systems than those in context of which they were
    described. For instance, the angled or non-circular suction rings could be combined with the
    plano-concave applanation lens or by integrated into the system having the suction ring and lens
20  cone co-molded. Likewise, the fluid-filled bladder and lens cone could include structure at the
    upper end of the lens cone for coupling to a laser delivery system using a vacuum.           The
    permutations are numerous and only excluded by physical barriers to such combination.
