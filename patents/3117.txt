     entirety.
     Background
     [0002]        In most homes and buildings, turning on and off lights,
     lamps, or other devices is accomplished by toggling a switch that is wired
15   into the building's electrical system. This paradigm requires the location
     of the lighting, fixtures, switches, and devices to be based on the location of
     the physical wires installed by licensed electricians, typically during initial
     construction. If there is a desire to relocate or any of the devices or to alter

 WO 2015/134493                                                 PCT/US2015/018481
     how the devices are controlled, there is no practical means to do so without
     moving and/or running additional fixed power wires.
     [0003]        The difficulties associated with adding on to or altering a
     structure's electrical system presents a number of inconveniences and
 5   costs to the building occupant. First, the locations of the fixtures and
     switches are established by the builder, not the occupant. Over time,
     usage changes and successive occupants need different configurations
     other than those envisioned by the builder. Second, moving fixtures and
     wiring is costly and disruptive. It requires construction professionals to
10   relocate wires by tearing into walls and ceilings and then repairing and
     repainting entire rooms in order to mask the changes.
     Summary
     [0004]        While the power source for lighting, fixtures and other devices
     must be built into the walls, embodiments disclosed herein enable the
15   switching function and the switches to be freed from fixed, high-voltage
     wiring. The inventive systems, methods, and protocols enable lighting and
     other electric and electronic devices to be controlled by battery-powered,
     radio-controlled switches, computers, and mobile smart phones.
     [0005]        Accordingly, networking systems, methods, and protocols are
20   provided for controlling target devices. The protocols facilitate peer-to
     peer communication between many low cost devices over a wireless
     network, enabling many-to-many control relationships while obviating the
     need for a central controller to supervise, control, or create the
     communications network.
25   [0006]        According to some embodiments, the network systems may
     include three primary types of devices: initialization and control devices for
     configuring and controlling the network devices; adaptors for receiving,
     implementing, and rebroadcasting commands received over the network;
                                           -2-

 WO 2015/134493                                                PCT/US2015/018481
     and switches for sensing user input and communicating control commands
     to the adaptors. Generally speaking, the initialization and control devices
     may be used to teach the adaptors and switches their prescribed roles in
     the network system. Once taught, the adaptors and switches may
 5   communicate directly with each other in peer-to-peer fashion with or
     without the presence of a central controller.
     [0007]        A network system may further include a bridge device that
     can provide the system with remote interface capability without the need
     for a central controller node. The bridge device may be configured as a
10   network component of the network system that provides an interface for
     accessing and operating the other configured network components. In
     some embodiments, the bridge device may be implemented as a radio
     device capable of communicating with the various other devices of the
     network system that may be in communication with a remote server via an
15   Internet-connected device. In other embodiments, the bridge device may
     be configured as a bridge component that connects directly to the Internet
     for communication with the remote server. The bridge device may also be
     implemented in software or firmware resident on another device of the
     network system, such as an adaptor or switch, for example. Access to the
20   interface of the bridge device for control of the network system may then
     be attained through connection to the remote server from any Internet
     connected electronic device.
     [0008]        Methods for initializing and operating electric and electronic
     devices over the network are disclosed. The methods may involve
25   providing a network system having one or more initialization and control
     devices, adaptors, switches, and electric devices. The methods may further
     include an initialization step, during which the initialization device may
     teach the adaptors and switches their respective roles within the network
     system. Initialization may include defining, for each switch and adaptor,
                                          -3-

 WO 2015/134493                                                PCT/US2015/018481
     its address, which devices to respond to, its schedules, and other behaviors.
     The methods may further include an operation step in which the switches
     and adaptors may communicate autonomously with or without the
     presence of a central controller.

     Detailed Description of the Disclosure
10   [0021]        Network systems, protocols, and methods are provided for
     controlling electric and electronic devices. The benefits of freeing the
     switches from the fixed wiring in a building's electrical system are
     manifold. For example, the switches may be easily relocated according to
     changes in furniture arrangements, room usage patterns, and occupant
15   preferences while reducing or avoiding wiring and rewiring costs and
     disruptions. Further, electric and electronic devices, such as lighting and
     fixtures, may be controlled from multiple locations and multiple
     controllers. Changing how the electric and electronic devices are
     controlled may also be accomplished without altering the building's fixed
20   wiring plan.
     [0022]        The disclosed protocols and methods may be used to easily
     implement a network system for controlling a variety of electric and
     electronic devices. For example, the network system may control lighting
     fixtures, household appliances (e.g., dishwashers, ranges, washing
25   machines, dryers, thermostats, air conditioning units, sump pumps, and
     electrically operated heaters and fireplaces), entertainment and
     productivity devices (e.g., televisions, media players, computers, and audio
     systems), security devices (e.g., alarm systems and video surveillance
                                           -5-

 WO 2015/134493                                               PCT/US2015/018481
     equipment), and/or any other type of electrically operated device or
     appliance. Such devices and appliances may be referred to herein as
     "target devices." A target device coupled to an adaptor may be referred to
     herein as a "controlled device."
 5   [0023]        FIG. 1 depicts a schematic diagram of network system 100 for
     controlling target devices, in accordance with some embodiments.
     Network system 100 may include one or more initialization/control ("I/C")
     devices 110, switches 120, controlled devices 130, and bridges 160.
     Network system 100 may be installed in any suitable fixed or moveable
10   structure, such as a residential or commercial building, a tent, or a trailer,
     for example. I/C devices 110, switches 120, adaptors, which may be part of
     controlled devices 130, and bridges 160 may be referred to herein as
     "network components."
     [0024]        According to some embodiments, I/C devices 110 may serve
15   dual functions in network system 100. First, I/C devices 110 may be used
     to configure all of the components of network system 100 (e.g.,
     switches 120, adaptors in controlled devices 130, bridges 160, and other I/C
     devices 110). Configuration of these system components is described in
     detail below with respect to FIGS. 5 and 9. Generally speaking, however, a
20   user may interact with computer programs running on one or more of I/C
     devices 110 to define desired system functionality, such as defining which
     switches 120 control which controlled devices 130, defining automatically
     scheduled behaviors for controlled devices 130, and so on.
     [0025]        Second, I/C devices 110 may be used as system controllers for
25   controlling all or a subset of the various system components. Accordingly,
     a user interacting with a computer program installed on I/C devices 110
     may be able to control individual switches 120 and/or individual controlled
     devices 130. In some embodiments, a user may interact with a user
     interface provided by the computer program to send commands to selected
                                           -6-

 WO 2015/134493                                                PCT/US2015/018481
     switches 120 and/or individual controlled devices 130. I/C devices 110 may
     facilitate control of various control functions as appropriate for the type of
     controlled device or devices present in network system 100.
     [0026]        Examples of electronic devices that may be used as I/C
 5   devices 110 may include any suitable type of electronic device operative to
     communicate with switches 120 and controlled devices 130. For example,
     I/C devices 110 can include digital media players, cellular telephones,
     smartphones, pocket-sized personal computers, personal digital assistants
     (PDAs), tablets, desktop computers, laptop computers, and/or any other
10   suitable electronic device.
     [0027]        Communication between I/C devices 110 and switches 120
     and/or controlled devices 130 may be implemented over the protocols
     described herein and/or over any other suitable wired or wireless interface,
     such as via Wi-Fi@ (e.g., a 802.11 protocol), Ethernet, Bluetooth@, radio
15   frequency systems (e.g., 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5.6 GHz communication
     systems), cellular networks (e.g., GSM, AMPS, GPRS, CDMA, EV-DO,
     EDGE, 3GSM, DECT, IS-136/TDMA, iDen, LTE or any other suitable
     cellular network or protocol), infrared, TCP/IP (e.g., any of the protocols
     used in each of the TCP/IP layers), other relatively localized wireless
20   communication protocol, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments,
     communications may be conducted over combinations of wired and
     wireless paths. As described in more detail below with respect to FIGS. 5
     7, I/C devices 110 may communicate directly with switches 120 and
     controlled devices 130 or indirectly via an intermediary device such as a
25   Wi-Fi@ router, for example. Communications components provided within
     I/C devices 110, switches 120, controlled devices 130, and bridges 160 may
     be referred to herein as "transceivers" regardless of the particular mode or
     modes of communication used to implement the communications.
                                           -7-

 WO 2015/134493                                                   PCT/US2015/018481
     [0028]        Switches 120 may be provided within network system 100 to
     sense user input and translate the input into a control signal for
     implementation by one or more controlled devices 130. The control signal
     may be transmitted via a switch transceiver. The type of control signal(s)
 5   generated by a particular switch may depend on the controlled devices 130
     the switch is configured to control. In the simplest case, a switch may be
     configured to toggle a state (e.g., turn on or off) of one or more controlled
     devices 130. Thus, in some embodiments switches 120 may include one or
     more wall-mounted light switches configured to turn one or more lights on
10   and off. Switches 120 may also include more complex switches, such as
     light dimmers, fan controllers, thermostat controllers, appliance
     controllers, and/or entertainment system controllers, for example. These
     more complex switches may utilize physical control elements (e.g., dials,
     sliders, and/or buttons) and/or virtual control elements (e.g., onscreen user
15   interface elements) to generate control signals directed to one or more
     particular controlled devices 130.
     [0029]        In some embodiments, switches 120 may be powered by one
     or more power sources external to the structure's fixed, high-voltage
     electrical system, such as batteries, for example. Physically decoupling
20   switches 120 from the structure's electrical system may beneficially allow
     for these physical components, which are often very difficult to move, to be
     placed in any convenient locations throughout the structure. Furthermore,
     adding additional switches to network system 100 may simply involve
     placing the additional switches within range of network system 100 and
25   configuring the additional switches to control one or more controlled
     devices 130.
     [0030]        It should be understood that existing switches already
     hardwired into a structure's existing electrical system may be configured
     to control controlled devices 130 while continuing to be powered by the
                                           -8-

 WO 2015/134493                                                 PCT/US2015/018481
     building's electrical system. Such hardwired switches may be retrofit with
     transceivers that facilitate communications between switches 120,
     controlled devices 130, bridges 160, and I/C devices 110. In these
     embodiments, some minor re-wiring of controlled devices 130 and
 5   switches 120 may be necessary to bypass the traditional hardwired
     switching functionality and provide constant, non-switched power to the
     switch.
     [0031]        Controlled devices 130 may include two main components, a
     target device and an adaptor. As discussed above, the target device may
10   be any suitable electrical or electronic device capable of being controlled.
     An adaptor may include various components for receiving and
     implementing control signals generated by I/C devices 110 and/or
     switches 120. For example, an adaptor may include one or more of a
     transceiver for receiving control and/or initialization signals from I/C
15   devices 110 and/or switches 120, a central processor, a memory, an
     antenna, a line power switch and/or a dimming circuit, one or more sensors
     (e.g., heat sensors, motion sensors), and a control output interface for
     implementing complex control commands (e.g., speed control, motion
     control, or other complex commands).
20   [0032]        Instructions may be stored in the adaptor's memory that
     define various adaptor settings and behaviors. For example, the
     instructions may define which I/C devices 110 and/or switches 120 the
     adaptor should respond to, automated control schedules, and/or other
     behaviors. The instructions may be loaded into the adaptor's memory
25   during an initialization process, as described in detail below with respect
     to FIGS. 5 and 9.
     [0033]        Bridge 160 can provide a remote interface to network
     system 100 to enable remote operation of the network's various network
     components. In this manner, network system 100 may be accessed and
                                           -9-

 WO 2015/134493                                                 PCT/US2015/018481
     controlled even if I/C devices 110 are out of range without the need for a
     central controller. No central controller is necessary for remote control of
     network system 100 because bridge 160 can be configured as yet another
     network component, like switches 120 and controlled devices 130, for
 5   example. Accordingly, bridge 160 can provide access to network
     system 100 as a network component of the network, not as a gateway or
     central access point.
     [0034]         Bridge 160 can, therefore, be a low-cost, simple device
     configured to relay messages between network system 100 and a remote
10   server. Generally speaking, bridge 160 can: permit remote visibility, via a
     remote device, of the current status of the various configured network
     components even while the remote device is out of range of network
     system 100; issue commands to network system 100 via the remote server
     and bridge 160 to monitor and/or change the status of one or more network
15   components; and/or send a set of commands to a range of network
     components. Examples of functions that might not be permitted when
     accessing network system 100 via bridge 160 (e.g., to promote network
     security) may include: adding, deleting, or authenticating network
     components; updating usernames, passwords, or security keys; obtaining
20   MAC addresses of network components; and creating or modifying network
     component groups or scenes. Scenes may generally be understood as pre
     set control settings for one or more controlled devices 130 (e.g., turn on all
     kitchen lights and the coffee maker at 6AM, dim all living room lights at
     8PM, or preheat oven and turn on stereo at 5PM).
25   [0035]         Bridge 160 can include a transceiver that enables
     communications between every other network using the protocol
     established for the network. Via the transceiver, bridge 160 can have
     visibility to all of the network components of network 100 including, for
     example, the address of each network component and its functionalities
                                          - 10 -

 WO 2015/134493                                                PCT/US2015/018481
     (e.g., whether the component is a switch or controlled device, which other
     components a particular component controls or responds to, etc.).
     Additionally, bridge 160 may be connected or connectable to a remote
     server via an outside network (e.g., the Internet) using a wired or wireless
 5   interface, such as one or more of the interfaces listed above, for example.
     [0036]         A remote device may then connect to the remote server to
     gain access to network system 100 via bridge 160. When the remote device
     connects to the remote server, commands directed to network system 100
     can be relayed through the remote server to the interface of bridge 160.
10   Because bridge 160 is secured to network system 100 during the
     initialization process, further security for bridge 160 may not be required.
     The remote server can be secured against unauthorized access using
     authentication procedures known in the art (e.g., passwords, two-factor
     authentication, etc.). Bridge 160 may be configured to connect to a router
15   that facilitates communications to the remote server, which configuration
     may entail providing the bridge with security credentials to log into the
     remote server.
     [0037]         Bridge 160 may further include a central processor and a
     memory for storing instructions that can define its role in network
20   system 100. For example, the instructions may define an interface for
     providing a remote device with access to the other network components of
     network system 100. Accordingly, the memory may store a database
     containing the relationships between the various network components,
     such as which switches 120 are configured to control which controlled
25   devices 130, for example, and allow operation of switches 120 and
     controlled devices 130. The instructions may be loaded into the adaptor's
     memory during an initialization process.

 WO 2015/134493                                                  PCT/US2015/018481
     network, however, the functionality of interface may be limited only to
     accessing information that was previously defined during an initialization
     process. In this manner, a remote user may be permitted to connect to
     bridge 160 through the remote server and operate switches 120 and/or
 5   controlled devices 130 per the configuration data stored in the database of
     bridge 160. That is, while network components of network system can be
     controlled remotely, a remote user may be prevented from altering the
     configuration of network system 100 using bridge 160. Because bridge 160
     can be configured during an initialization process by an account holder
10   authorized to configure the network and bridge 160 must be within range
     of the network to operate, it may not be necessary for the device to have
     separate security access or to be granted security keys for the network.
     Remote access to network system 100 may, therefore, be permitted far
     more cheaply and easily than in systems that require a central controller
15   or another non-network component device to facilitate remote access.
     [0039]         In some embodiments, bridge 160 can include a transceiver
     (e.g., a Bluetooth@ transceiver) that facilitates communications with the
     other network components of network system 100 and a communications
     interface to a separate device (e.g., a PC, tablet, or laptop computer)
20   capable of communications with the remote server via an outside network,
     such as the Internet, for example. As one particular example, bridge 160
     may be implemented as a Universal Serial Bus ("USB") "dongle" that can
     be connected to an Internet-connected device, such as the family computer,
     for example. These embodiments advantageously permit bridge 160 to be
25   manufactured relatively cheaply because the connection to the remote
     service is facilitated using another network-connected device. However, in
     order to maintain access to the remote server, that network-connected
     device must remain powered-on and connected to the outside network. In
     another example, bridge 160 may include a second transceiver (e.g., a
                                          -  12 -

 WO 2015/134493                                                PCT/US2015/018481
     Bluetooth@ transceiver) to facilitate communications with the separate
     device.
     [0040]        In an alternative implementation, bridge 160 can include both
     the transceiver for communicating with the other network components as
 5   well as the wired or wireless interface to the remote server via the outside
     network. Accordingly, remote access to network system 100 may not be
     dependent on the availability of a separate network-connected device. As
     one example, bridge 160 may be a standalone device that communicates
     with the other network components of network system 100 via a
10   Bluetooth@ transceiver and with the remote server via a Wi-Fi@
     connection or other suitable wired or wireless network connection (e.g., an
     Ethernet, 3G, or 4G LTE connection) to the Internet. In the event that
     bridge 160 is capable of Wi-Fi@ communications, I/C devices 110 may be
     used to configure the Wi-Fi@ connection. For example, bridge 160 may
15   recognize a list of available Wi-Fi@ networks, provide that list to I/C
     devices 110 (e.g., using the transceiver), and connect to a selected Wi-Fi@
     network by receiving authentication information (e.g., a password) from
     I/C devices 110.
     [0041]        In still further implementations, an existing network
20   component of network 100, such as one of one or more of switches 120 or
     adaptors 140 (disclosed in detail below) or a generic gateway device, for
     example, may be configured to carry out the functionalities of bridge 160.
     In these embodiments, software or firmware may be installed on the
     existing network component in order to provide an interface to grant a
25   remote device access to control network system 100. The network
     component that implements the bridge functionality can then
     communicate, using either the communications protocol of network
     system 100 or another suitable wired or wireless communications protocol
     (e.g., WiFi@) with a device having a wired or wireless interface to the
                                         - 13  -

     [0042]         FIG. 2 shows a schematic view of controlled device 130, in
     accordance with some embodiments. Controlled device 130 may include
 5   target device 132 coupled to adaptor 140 with one or more power/control
     lines 136 (shown in more detail in FIG. 3). Adaptor 140 may include
     antenna 142, which may be responsible for transmitting and/or receiving
     signals within a network system (e.g., network system 100 of FIG. 1), and
     power/control unit 144 for implementing control signals directed to target
10   device 132.
     [0043]         In some embodiments, antenna 142 and other low-voltage
     components of adaptor 140, such as a processor and a memory, may be
     packaged separately from the high-voltage components housed in
     power/control unit 144. Packaging antenna 142 separately from the high
15   voltage components may prevent signal degradation caused by RF
     interference generated by target device 132, power/control unit 144,
     power/control lines 136, and/or any other high-voltage components of
     controlled device 130. Furthermore, the high-voltage components may be
     located inside a fixture 134 sized and shaped appropriately for target
20   device 132. For example, in when the target device is a recessed light,
     fixture 134 may be a can that may shield antenna 142, located outside of
     fixture 134, from interference. Housing the high-voltage components of
     controlled device 130 within fixture 134 may support electrical safety
     certifications, improved visual concealment, and convenience, for example.
25   [0044]         Power/control unit 144 may include a central processor for
     implementing control signals received at antenna 142. The central
     processor may be any suitable processing device, such as a microprocessor
     configured to perform operations based on execution of software and/or
     firmware instructions, or an ASIC that is configured to perform various
                                         - 14 -

 WO 2015/134493                                                PCT/US2015/018481
     operations, for example. Operations performed by the central processor
     may include retrieving data from and/or writing data to a memory of
     power/control unit 144. For example, during an initialization process, the
     central processor may receive instructions regarding one or more of an
 5   address, which control signals to implement, and/or automatically
     implemented scheduling instructions for controlled device 130. During
     operation, the central processor may access the information stored in the
     memory in order to implement control functions for target device 132.
     [0045]        Adaptor 140 may retransmit signals received at antenna 142
10   to enable the network system to operate as a peer-to-peer, many-to-many
     control system. That is, besides merely implementing control signals
     received at antenna 142, adaptor 140 (as well as all other network
     components of network system 100) may also rebroadcast received control
     signals to other components (e.g., other switches, adaptors, and bridges) of
15   the network system. In this manner, the network system may operate
     using relatively short-range wireless signals, such as those used in the
     Bluetooth® protocol.
     [0046]        Power/control unit 144 may include a physical circuit for
     implementing simple power control functions for target device 132. For
20   example, if target device 132 is a light, power/control unit 144 may include
     a line power switch and/or a dimming circuit to facilitate on/off and
     dimming control of target device 132, respectively. For more complex
     target devices, power/control unit 144 may include a control output
     interface for implementing more complex control commands, such as
25   changing color, fan speed, operating mode, etc. In some embodiments,
     power/control unit 144 may be a generic controller capable of controlling
     many different types of target devices. In other embodiments, however, a
     specialized power/control unit 144 may be provided that specifically
                                          - 15 -

     implements only the types of control functions available for the coupled
     target device 132.
     [0047]        FIG. 3 shows a schematic view of adaptor 140, in accordance
     with some embodiments. As discussed above, central processor 145 and
 5   memory 146 may be housed with antenna 142 separate and apart from
     power/control unit 144. In other embodiments, however, central
     processor 145 and/or memory 146 may be housed along with control
     circuitry in power/control unit 144 in order to give the housing for
     antenna 142 a smaller form factor.
10   [0048]        Power and control signals for a target device (e.g., target
     device 132 of FIG. 2) may be generated within power/control unit 144 and
     sent to target device 132 via power/control lines 136. Power/control
     lines 136 may include one or more control lines 136a for carrying control
     signals from power/control unit 144 to the target device, AC Line Out 136b
15   for carrying AC power from power/control unit 144 to the target device, AC
     Line In 136c for receiving AC power from the structure's fixed electrical
     wiring system, and AC Common (Neutral) Line 136d. Simple on/off or
     dimming control may be implemented within power/control unit 144 by
     varying the average power provided over AC Line Out 136b. More complex
20   control commands may be generated by central processor 145 carried over
     control lines 136a to a control interface of the target device. Any suitable
     number of individual control lines 136a may be provided to implement
     available control functionality of the target device.
     [0049]        FIGS. 4A-4C show a side cross-sectional and front and back
25   plan views, respectively, of an illustrative network switch 120, in
     accordance with some embodiments. Switch 120 may include housing 122,
     input sensor 124, battery 126, and communications unit 128. Like
     adaptor 140, switch 120 may be equipped with an antenna, which may be
     housed within communications unit 128, for transmitting, receiving,
                                          - 16 -

     and/or retransmitting control signals to other components in a network
     system (e.g., network system 100 of FIG. 1).
     [0050]        In some modes of operation, switch 120 may generate control
     signals in the first instance, such as in response to receiving user input at
 5   input sensor 124. Input sensor 124 may be any type of device capable of
     sensing user input, such as a single-pole switch, a double-pole switch, a
     multi-way switch, a touch-sensitive switch (e.g., a touch sensitive
     capacitive or resistive sensor), a dimmer, a dial, or a slider, for example.
     Input sensor 124 may also be embodied as a touch-sensitive display screen
10   with virtual interface elements (e.g., virtual buttons, sliders, dials, etc.) for
     providing control signals to other network devices, such as controlled
     devices 130. While control signals generated by switch 120 may be
     addressed to particular adaptors 140 within network system 100, such
     signals may be broadcast to all other switches and adaptors in range.
15   Those other switches and adaptors may then implement the control
     signals, ignore the control signals, and/or retransmit the control signals to
     further components of network system 100.
     [0051]        In other modes of operation, switch 120 may passively receive
     control signals generated by other components of network system 100 and
20   retransmit the control signals to other switches 120 and adaptors 140 in
     range. Thus, a control signal generated at a first component may, through
     initial transmission and subsequent retransmissions, reach every other
     component in network system 100 even if network system 100 extends
     beyond the range of the wireless signals transmitted by any individual
25   network component.
     [0052]        In some embodiments, switch 120 may be controllable via
     another component of network system 100, such as I/C devices 110, a
     remote device (e.g., via bridge 160), and/or another switch, for example. It
     may be considerably more convenient for a user to control an individual
                                          - 17 -

 WO 2015/134493                                                PCT/US2015/018481
     switch (e.g., using I/C devices 110) rather than controlling individual
     adaptors 140, especially if the switch is configured to control multiple
     controlled devices 130. Thus, in addition to merely generating and
     retransmitting control signals, switch 120 may also receive and implement
 5   control signals received from other components of network system 100.
     [0053]         Switch 120 may be powered by a power source external to the
     structure's fixed electrical wiring system, thus enabling switch 120 to be
     installed or moved easily, without engaging in costly and disruptive
     construction activity. The external power source may be a battery, such as
10   battery 126, for example.
     [0054]        It should be noted, however, that in some embodiments, pre
     existing switches already wired into a structure's fixed electrical wiring
     system may be retrofit with communications unit 128 to allow such
     switches to communicate with other components of network system 100.
15   In these embodiments, some minor rewiring of switch 120 and controlled
     devices 130 may be required to modify the control mechanism used by
     switch 120 to control corresponding controlled devices 130. For example, a
     single-pole light switch may be rewired such that constant power flows to
     communications unit 128 without the mechanical switching element being
20   enabled to open and close the circuit. Rather, the mechanical switching
     element may instead be configured to send a signal to communications
     unit 128 for transmission to the other network components of network
     system 100.
     [0055]         Communications unit 128 may include a central processor, a
25   memory, and a transceiver. These components may be substantially
     similar in structure and functionality to the corresponding components of
     adaptor 140. However, given that switch 120 may lack the high-voltage
     components of controlled device 130, the transceiver may be packaged with
                                          - 18 -

     the other switch components without encountering adverse RF
     interference.
     [0056]        There are at least four key modes of the network system,
     methods, and protocols disclosed herein: teaching, operating, remote, and
 5   command forwarding modes. One or more of these key modes may be
     password protected to prevent unauthorized access to the network system.
     FIG. 5 shows a pictorial diagram of teaching mode 500. After establishing
     a user account, which may provide a user with access to configure and
     control a network system (e.g., network system 100 of FIG. 1), the user
10   may initiate teaching mode 500.
     [0057]        In teaching mode 500, a user may, using a computer program
     installed on an I/C device (e.g., one of I/C devices 110 of FIG. 1, such as a
     desktop computer, laptop computer, tablet, or smartphone), define one or
     more desired configurations of the network system and teach each
15   component (e.g., I/C devices 110, switches 120, and controlled devices 130)
     of the network system its role(s). Teaching mode 500 may utilize device-to
     device communications sessions between an I/C device and the network
     components to be configured via a Bluetooth@ master/slave
     communications session or using a similar communications protocol.
20   [0058]        To ensure that the correct network component is connected to
     the I/C device and ready to be taught, each switch and adaptor in the
     network system may be provided with an indicator (e.g., a visible and/or an
     audible signal) that can provide a user with confirmation that the proper
     network component is connected in the device-to-device communications
25   session. In some embodiments, exemplary visual signals may be output in

     [0060]        The Teach Switch IDs service can be used to add one or more
     switches (e.g., switches 120 of FIG. 1) to a network system. This service
     may be performed on switches that are "unclaimed," meaning that the
 5   switch is not already configured as part of a network system. The switch
     may associated with the network system by writing the network system's
     address, referred to above as the TeachIdsRqP1 characteristic, into the
     network component's memory. Subsequently the network component
     being configured may be assigned a unique Device Id for addressing the
10   switch within the network system. Device Ids may be assigned using
     consecutively, randomly, or otherwise assigned to each network component
     as it is added to the network system. In some embodiments, the user may
     be permitted to define manually the switch's Device Id, which may be
     useful in circumstances in which the network system's control behavior is
15   defined prior to the network components are configured.
     [0061]        Optionally, the network system may be configured with one or
     more levels of password protection. In particular, one or more components
     of the network system may be protected by an administrator (admin)
     password and one or more user passwords. While a user having the
20   administrator password may be given full rights to define or alter all
     aspects of the network system configuration, user's having only individual
     user rights may be more restricted. For example, the administrator may
     have the right to add and configure new network components, remove
     network components from the network system, reset network components,
25   perform network system diagnostics, etc., while an individual user may
     only be given the right to add or configure controlled device(s) that respond

 5   the communications sessions, and based upon the defined configuration(s),
     each of controlled devices 130 may be assigned an address used for

     devices are added to the network. For example, using an I/C device, a user
     may establish a network configuration by defining addresses and control
     behaviors for network components that are expected to become part of the
     network system. Thus, if the user knows that the network system will
 5   initially include 15 switches and 10 controlled devices, the user may define
     (1) an address for each switch and each controlled device, (2) for each
     controlled device, which switch or switches to respond to, and (3) for each
     switch, which controlled device or devices to control. Then, during a
     device-to-device communications session for a particular network
10   component, the I/C device can perform both the Teach Ids service and the
     Teach Target service contemporaneously without regard to whether the
     Device Id / Group Id for a controlled device has already been established.
     Therefore, it may be possible to establish a device-to-device
     communications session between an I/C device and each other network
15   component in the network system during which each network component
     is "taught" its address (e.g., via the Teach Ids service), which other
     network component(s) to control (e.g., via the Teach Target service), and
     various other behaviors, such as automatically scheduled control
     behaviors.
20   [0076]         A user may also initiate a device-to-device communications
     session with each one or more bridges 160. During the communications
     sessions, and based upon the defined configuration(s), each bridge 160 may
     be assigned an address used for identification within the network system.
     Bridge 160 may also store a database containing the configuration of
25   network system 100, which may include, for example, a mapping between
     switches 120 to controlled devices 130.
     [0077]         During the teaching mode, additional I/C devices 110 may be
     configured to control one or more network components. Each one of I/C
     devices 110 may be permitted to control all or a subset of the network

     with a smartphone living in the structure may be permitted to use the
     smartphone to control the lights in his or her room, but may be restricted
     from using the smartphone to control household appliances like an oven,

     components like a furnace, sump pump, or water heater, for example.
     [0078]        FIG. 6 shows a pictorial diagram of operating mode 600, in
     accordance with some embodiments. After teaching each network
     component its role within the network system, the network system may
10   enter operating mode 600. Operating mode may be an autonomous state
     in which the switches and adaptors can communicate with each other with
     or without the presence of an I/C device, a central controller, a Wi-Fi@
     network, or an Internet connection. For example, switches 120 may
     generate and transmit control signals to adaptors 140 to turn on/off, dim,
15   change speeds, adjust operating priorities, or otherwise implement control
     functions of controlled devices 130. It should be noted that while
     switches 120 and adaptors 140 may communicate without the presence of
     I/C devices 110, these devices may also capable of sending control signals
     to individual adaptors, groups of adaptors, individual switches, or groups
20   of switches.
     [0079]        FIG. 7A shows a pictorial diagram of remote mode 700A, in
     accordance with some embodiments. Remote mode 700A may represent an
     alternative implementation of teaching mode 500 and/or operating
     mode 600. In remote mode 700A, an Internet-connected device, such as a
25   home router, for example, may translate control signals received via the
     Internet or other source to wireless commands transmitted by a
     transmitter capable of generating control signals for switches 120 and
     adaptors 140. In this manner, teaching mode 500 and operating mode 600
     may be controlled from a remote location.

     [0080]        FIG. 7B shows a pictorial diagram of remote mode 700B, in
     accordance with some embodiments. Remote mode 700B can provide a
     remote device (e.g., I/C device 110 or any other electronic device capable of
     communicating with remote server 162) remote access to network
 5   system 100 via remote server 162, an outside network, such as the
     Internet, and bridge 160. Bridge 160, which can be configured during
     teaching mode 500 as a network component of network system 100, may be
     implemented as a standalone device with a transceiver for communicating
     with the other network components of network system 100 and a wired or
10   wireless interface to the outside network or as a "dongle"-type device that
     can connect to the outside network via an intermediate network-connected
     device, such as a PC, for example. In either case, I/C devices 110, or any
     other suitable network-connected device, can connect to bridge 160 via
     remote server 162 in order to control the various network components of
15   network system 100.
     [0081]        FIG. 8 shows a pictorial diagram of command forwarding
     mode 800, in accordance with some embodiments. While in teaching
     mode 500, operating mode 600, remote mode 700A, or remote mode 700B,
     switches 120 and adaptors 140 can forward control signals from one
20   network component to another by retransmitting control signals or other
     messages, enabling a command to reach components that would otherwise
     be out of range of direct device-to-device communication. The forwarding
     may be accomplished via simple rebroadcast of the message, obviating the
     need for specific addressing of, or establishing a two-way communications
25   session with, an individual switch 120 or adaptor 140.

     implementing a teaching mode of a network system, in accordance with

     system (e.g., network system 100) is provided having network components

     that include at least one I/C device (e.g., at least one of I/C devices 110 of
     FIG. 1), at least one switch (e.g., at least one of switches 120 of FIG. 1),
     and at least one controlled device (e.g., at least one of controlled
     devices 130 of FIG. 1). The I/C devices may include any type of computing
 5   device capable of communicating with the switch(es) and controlled
     device(s) using the protocols described herein or any other suitable wired
     or wireless communications protocol. The switch(es) may be configurable
     by the I/C device(s) to control the behavior of one or more of the controlled
     device(s). The controlled device(s) may include any suitable controllable
10   device communicatively coupled to an adaptor (e.g., adaptor 140 of FIG. 2).
     [0083]        At step 903, the desired control behavior of the network
     components may be defined. Defining the desired control behavior can
     include establishing a mapping between switches and adaptors to be added
     to the network system. For example, using an I/C device, a user may
15   establish a network configuration by defining at least one of' an address
     for each switch and each controlled device to be added to the network
     system; a mapping of which switch or switches each adaptor respond to;
     and which controlled device or devices each switch is to control. Step 903
     is shown in dashed lines, indicating that this step is optional. In
20   particular, in embodiments in which the desired control behavior for the
     network system is not defined in advance of configuring the network
     components, process 900 may proceed directly from step 901 to step 905.
     [0084]        At step 905, each network component may be taught its
     address within the network system during a master/slave communications
25   session between the network component and an I/C device. Teaching each
     network component its address may include establishing a device-to-device
     communications session between an I/C device and each switch and
     adaptor in the network system, associating the network component with
     the Location Id of the network system, and assigning the network
                                           - 32 -

     component a unique address (e.g., using the Teach Switch IDs service and
     the Teach Adaptor IDs service).
     [0085]         At step 907, each switch may be taught which controlled
     device(s) (i.e., targets) to control. Step 907 may be conducted using the
 5   Teach Target service described above, for example. In some embodiments,
     adaptors may also be taught which switch(es)'s control signals to
     implement (e.g., using a service similar to the Teach Target service that
     instructs an adaptor to implement controls from one or more switches). As
     noted above with respect to FIG. 5, the target may be defined as a single
10   adaptor (i.e., via a Device ID) or to a group of adaptors (i.e., via a Group
     ID).
     [0086]         At step 909, each adaptor may be taught a Group ID.
     Adaptors may be taught a Group ID using the Teach Group Ids service
     described above, for example. Step 909 is shown in dashed lines indicating
15   that the step is optional. For example, if no groups of controlled devices
     are defined, step 909 may be omitted.
     [0087]         At step 911, each adaptor may be taught one or more
     scheduled behaviors. Scheduled behaviors may be taught using one or
     more of the Set Adaptor Time, Teach Adaptor Schedule, and Teach
20   Home/Away services described above. Step 909 is shown in dashed lines
     indicating that the step is optional. For example, if no scheduled behaviors
     are to be defined, step 909 may be omitted. In some embodiments,
     scheduled behaviors may be taught to one or more switches as well using
     services similar to those described above for scheduling adaptor behaviors.
25   [0088]          FIG. 10 shows a flowchart of an illustrative process 1000 for
     operating a network system, in accordance with some embodiments.
     Process 1000 may begin at step 1001, in which a network system having
     network components, including I/C devices, switches, and controlled
     devices (e.g., network system 100, I/C devices 110, switches 120, and
                                           - 33 -

     controlled devices 130 of FIG. 1), may be provided. In some embodiments,
     the network system may be configured using process 900 of FIG. 9.
     [0089]        At step 1003, a control signal may be broadcast to all network
     components of the network system. The control signal may be sent from
 5   one of the switches or one of the I/C devices, for example, and may be
     addressed to an adaptor of a controlled device (e.g., using a Device Id) or to
     a group of adaptors (e.g., using a Group Id). In some preferred
     embodiments, the control signal may be sent from a transceiver of the I/C
     device or switch using a short-range wireless communications protocol,
10   such as Bluetooth@, for example. In these embodiments, the control signal
     may be received and retransmitted by each network component of the
     network system such that the control signal can propagate to all network
     components the network system even if one or more network components
     are initially out of the communications range of the I/C device or switch
15   that originated the control signal. In this manner, control of the network
     system may be effected without the need for a central controller.
     [0090]        At step 1005, the control signal may be implemented by at
     least one controlled to which the control signal is addressed. In the event
     that the control signal is addressed to a single adaptor, the addressed
20   adaptor can receive the control signal and implement the control signal via
     its associated target device. On the other hand, if the control signal is
     addressed to a group of adaptors, each adaptor can receive and implement
     the control signal via its associated target device.
     [0091]         FIG. 11 shows a flowchart of an illustrative process 1100 for
25   configuring a bridge, in accordance with some embodiments. At step 1101,
     a network component can receive configuration instructions to act as a
     bridge for a network system. As described above with respect to FIG. 1,
     the bridge (e.g., bridge 160) may be an existing network component of a
     network system (e.g., switch 120 or adaptor 140 of network system 100), a

     dongle-type device that can communicate with a remote server through a
     device connected to an outside network (e.g., a desktop computer
     communicatively coupled to the Internet), or the bridge may be a stand
     alone component that can communicate both with other network
 5   components via the communications protocol of the network system and an
     outside network via a separate communications interface (e.g., a WiFi@
     connection to a home router).
     [0092]        The initialization process for configuring the bridge may be
     similar to the process used for initializing other network components of the
10   network system using an initialization/control device as described above.
     Accordingly, the bridge can have access to and send and receive control
     signals to and from the other network components of the network system,
     which can allow a remote device communicatively coupled to the bridge to
     remotely control the network components. Additionally, however, the
15   initialization process for the bridge may include receiving requests at the
     bridge to scan for available connections to an outside network, and
     providing the bridge with any authentication credentials that may be
     required to access the outside network and/or a remote server. These
     additional steps may be implemented using an initialization/control device,
20   such as the initialization/control device used to configure the bridge as a
     network component of the network system.
     [0093]        At step 1103, the bridge can scan for an available connection
     to an outside network. In embodiments in which the bridge is equipped
     with a WiFi@ communications interface, the bridge may be assigned to a
25   WiFi@ endpoint able to scan for available WiFi@ networks. Once the
     desired WiFi@ network is chosen, the bridge may receive authentication
     credentials, if necessary, to connect to the WiFi@ network. In
     embodiments in which the bridge is equipped with a wired connection,
     such as an Ethernet connection, connection to the outside network may be
                                          - 35 -

     available without additional authentication. Similarly, if the bridge is
     embodied as a dongle-type device that communicates with another device
     having an established connection to an outside network, the bridge device
     may not require any additional authentication to connect to that outside
 5   network, thereby only requiring configuration as a network component of
     the network system.
     [0094]        At step 1105, the bridge can connect to the remote server via
     the outside network. The remote server may be a server operated by an
     entity that provides one or more components of network system 100, such
10   as software, firmware, and/or hardware, including switches 120, and
     adaptors 140, for example. The remote server may, in turn, be accessed by
     any electronic device with a communicative connection thereto and with
     proper authentication credentials.
     [0095]        At step 1107, the bridge can communicate with a remote
15   device via the outside network and the remote server. Once a properly
     authenticated remote device connects to the remote server, the bridge may
     provide the remote device (through the remote server) an interface that
     may present the status of various network components of the network
     system and facilitate operation of one or more of the network components.
20   In turn, the remote device can display the interface and receive commands
     to be passed via the remote server to the bridge device for operating one or
     more of the network components of the network system.
     [0096]        According to some embodiments, network components within
     network system 100 may communicate with one another using a novel
25   communications protocol. The protocol may incorporate, be built on top of,
     or otherwise utilize components of the standard Bluetooth@ protocol.
     Using at least a portion of the Bluetooth@ protocol to implement
     communications between components of network system 100 may be
     advantageous as devices already equipped with Bluetooth® transceivers
                                         - 36 -

     (e.g., I/C devices 110) are ubiquitous, and individual Bluetooth@
     transceivers for use in switches 120 and adaptors 140 are inexpensive and
     widely available.
     [0097]         Device-to-device communications may use different
 5   Bluetooth@ communications modes depending on the current mode of
     operation. In teaching mode 500, for example, an I/C device 110 may
     initiate a master/slave communications session with each switch 120 and
     adaptor 140 in turn in order to "teach" each component its role within
     network system 100.
10   [0098]         Once each component is taught, implementation commands
     (e.g., control signals) may be communicated using Bluetooth® broadcast
     messages in a peer-to-peer configuration. Thus, while each network
     component may receive every message, a particular component may only
     listen to and implement those messages addressed to it. Using Bluetooth®
15   broadcast messages to carry messages between components in network
     system 100, complex emergent behavior may be achieved without the need
     for a central controller of the network system. Furthermore, specific
     device-to-device messages are not necessary once the network components
     have been taught their respective roles.
20   [0099]         The broadcast messages can be sent very quickly, allowing
     near instantaneous command transmission even across multiple devices.
     Still further, since all elements are peers in the network any number of
     devices can act as switches and adaptors. Their role in the network may
     be defined by the role they are taught rather than their inherent design.
25   This method may enable high performance many-to-many networking
     while working within the current Bluetooth® specification without undue
     wasted network traffic that could cause interference or shorten battery life.

     protocol of this disclosure may be found in Appendices 1-3.

     software synchronous clock may take an AC power line signal 1236 as an
     input and generate clock output 1260 for use by power/control unit 1244.
 5   The United States uses a frequency of 60Hz to generate electric power for
     distribution to residential and commercial customers. This 60Hz signal
     can be received at power/control unit 1244 and converted, using software
     installed on the unit, into clock output 1260. Power/control unit 144 can
     then use clock output 1260 for timing sensitive applications, such as
10   implementing automatic schedules.
     [00102]       FIG. 13 shows a flowchart of an illustrative process 1300 for
     providing a software synchronous clock, in accordance with some
     embodiments. Process 1300 may begin at step 1301, in which a
     power/control unit (e.g., power/control unit 144 of FIG. 2 or power/control
15   unit 1244 of FIG. 12) may be coupled to one or more power control lines
     (e.g., power/control lines 136 of FIG. 2).
     [00103]       At step 1303, the power/control unit can receive an AC power
     signal over the one or more power/control lines. The AC signal may
     operate at the US standard 60 Hz or any other suitable electric power
20   distribution frequency.
     [00104]       At step 1305, the power/control unit can count the number of
     AC cycles. For instance, one or more software or firmware implemented
     counters may be incremented each time a peak (or any other regularly
     occurring portion) of the AC signal is detected. Each counter may be used
25   to keep time for a different purpose (e.g., automatically turning on/off a
     light controlled by the power/control unit, flashing such a light at a defined
     interval, or performing more complex timed control functions for complex
     appliances such as thermostats).

     [00105]       At step 1307, the power/control unit can generate a software
     synchronous clock output based on the counted AC cycles. In some
     embodiments, the clock output may be (or include) a real-time clock that
     can be referenced by the power/control unit for complex timing
 5   applications. In other embodiments, the power/control unit may simply
     reference one or more of the counters to determine the amount of time
     elapsed between two reference points. Thus, if a light controlled by the
     power/control unit is set to automatically turn off after a defined period of
     time, once the counter reaches a value associated with the period of time,
10   the light can turn off. Time and number of AC cycles may be related by
     the following equation:

     [00107]       Current thermostats are limited in their accuracy by the fact
     that they only measure the temperature, occupancy, or humidity in a
15   single room at a time. This situation often leads to over or under cooling or
     heating, wasting energy, and/or generally reducing comfort. Using a peer
     to-peer, many-to-many control system, such as the systems disclosed
     above, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems may be
     designed that permit the measurement of a multitude of HVAC related

     Accordingly, once each component of network system 200 is configured,
     such as by using an initialization process like teaching mode 500 disclosed
     above, for example, the components can communicate with one another
     without the need for a central controller.
 5   [00109]       I/C devices 210 may be similar in many respects to I/C
     devices 110 of FIG. 1. Thus, I/C devices 210 may be used to configure all of
     the components of network system 200, control all or a subset of the
     various system components as appropriate for the type of components or
     devices present in network system 200.
10   [00110]       Sensors 220 may be provided within network system 200 to
     sense one or more environmental variables in their vicinities. For
     instance, sensors 220 may sense one or more of: temperature, humidity,
     atmospheric pressure, occupancy, light, air flow, air quality, and noise
     level using sensing technology known in the art. By virtue of being a
15   component of network system 200, data sensed at sensors 220 may be
     made almost instantaneously available to each component of network
     system 200. Thus, all I/C devices 210, sensors 220, HVAC
     components 230, 232, 240, and 242 may have access to instantaneous and
     historical data collected by sensors 220 and shared over network
20   system 200. Sensors 220 may be added to network 220 using the
     straightforward initialization process described above, so it can be trivial
     to drastically improve the range, type, accuracy, and granularity of
     environmental readings collected for use in controlling the HVAC system
     of a building especially over single thermostat (or single thermostat per
25   zone) based HVAC systems. Individual HVAC components 230, 232, 240,
     and 242 may be individually controlled based on data collected from
     sensors 220 to more accurately control the correct temperature setting to
     maximize comfort, minimize energy consumption, or a combination of the
     two.

     [00111]       While system 200 is directed particularly to HVAC systems, it
     should be understood that the systems, methods, and protocols described
     herein may be adapted for use in any suitable type of telemetry
     application. For example, motion sensors, intrusion sensors, and/or
 5   cameras may be provided throughout a structure for use in an alarm
     system. Each sensor may be configured (e.g., using teaching mode 500
     described above) to communicate with each other sensor as well as with
     controlled devices, such as an alarm klaxon, a cellular or telephone based
     notification system (e.g., to alert a user or a third party like a police
10   department or monitoring company), and/or an I/C device, for example.
     [00112]       In another example, temperature sensors may be placed upon
     pipes that are prone to freezing such that signals may be sent, via the
     network components of the network system, to an adaptor that can control
     the flow of water through a pipe that is approaching the freezing point.
15   [00113]       It should be understood that sensors of all different types may
     be configured as part of a single network system. Thus, network
     system 100 and network system 200 may be configured as a single network
     system for control of controlled devices and for HVAC control. Any other
     sensors and controlled devices may be added to such a combined system at
20   any time using, for example, teaching mode 500.
     [00114]       Network system 200 can include a variety of HVAC
     components, including local cooling devices 230 (e.g., free-standing,
     window mounted, or wall mounted, and mini-split air conditioning units),
     central cooling devices 232 (e.g., ducted air conditioners), local heating
25   devices 240 (e.g., electric, natural gas, propane, oil, or wood pellet space
     heaters), and central heating devices 242 (e.g., a furnace with a forced hot
     air, water circulating, or steam circulating heat distribution system). Each
     HVAC component may include, or otherwise be communicatively coupled
     to, a transceiver that facilitates communications with I/C devices 210,

     sensors 220, the other HVAC components, and/or thermostat 250. In some
     embodiments, sensors 220 may be configured to exercise thermostatic
     control over particular HVAC components, or groups thereof, in order to
     optimize comfort and efficiency throughout the network. By analogy to
 5   network system 100, sensors 220 may be similar to switches 120 in that
     they sense an external input and send control signals to another network
     component, and HVAC components 230, 232, 240, and 242 may be similar
     to controlled devices 130 in that they can receive and implement control
     signals and provided by another network component (e.g., using an
10   adaptor, such as adaptor 140, or with an integrally provided transceiver
     and power/control modules).
     [00115]       Even in networks with central air conditioning and central
     heating, it may be advantageous to supplement the HVAC system with
     local heating and cooling devices to improve efficiency of the system and/or
15   to better control the comfort level throughout the structure. For example,
     if one room in a house is particularly drafty, a local heating device may be
     placed in that room to maximize comfort throughout the entire dwelling so
     that the central heating unit is not required to overheat the rest of the
     house in order to maintain a comfortable temperature in the drafty room.
20   Practically speaking, every room (or even portions of rooms) in a building
     may have its own peculiar micro-climate, and efficiency and comfort may
     be maximized by understanding those peculiarities and providing and
     controlling HVAC components individually.
     [00116]       Network system 200 is depicted as having central cooling
25   device 232 and central heating device 242 as well as a local cooling
     device 230, a local heating device 240, and a sensor 220 in each room.
     While such a system may provide extremely accurate heating and cooling
     for each room, such an overabundance of equipment may be costly,
     obtrusive, and/or unnecessary from a climate control perspective. Thus, in
                                          - 42 -

 WO 2015/134493                                                PCT/US2015/018481
     accordance with some embodiments, sensors 220 may provide data to help
     determine where supplemental heating and cooling devices (i.e., local
     cooling devices 230 and local heating devices 240) should be placed to
     maximize comfort and efficiency, including up front equipment costs and
 5   energy costs associated with various types of HVAC components.
     Sensors 220 may also help to determine, for a building without central
     cooling device 232 or central heating device 242, whether the installation
     of such a system may be part of an efficient HVAC solution for the
     building.
10   [00117]       In an illustrative example, a house incorporating network
     system 200 may initially be equipped with central cooling device 232 (e.g.,
     a ducted central air conditioning system), central heating device 242 (e.g.,
     a forced hot air heating system), and thermostat 250, which may be a
     traditional set point based HVAC control device that sends signals to turn
15   on or turn of central cooling device 232 and/or central heating device 242.
     Sensors 220 may be configured during an initialization process in one or
     more rooms of the house to determine the various microenvironments
     currently in existence. Data from sensors 220 can be shared among
     sensors 220 and thermostat 250 to provide more accurate temperature
20   adjustment than may be possible using thermostat 250 alone. With
     several sensors 220 placed throughout a house, it may be possible to
     provide better direction to thermostat 250 than relying on the thermostat
     alone. Thus, the problem of overheating or overcooling an entire house (or
     entire zones of a house) based on a single temperature measurement taken
25   at the thermostat can be avoided.
     [00118]       Thermostat 250 may, therefore, operate based upon: the input
     from a particular sensor (e.g., a sensor in a main living area) at all times;
     the input from various individual sensors at different times (e.g., a sensor
     in a main living area during the day and in a bedroom at night); or on a
                                         - 43  -

 WO 2015/134493                                               PCT/US2015/018481
     combination of one or more of the sensors in the network (e.g., an average
     of the temperatures read by each sensor in the network or a defined subset
     of the sensors in the network). Implementation of these operational modes
     may depend on the capabilities of thermostat 250. For instance, if
 5   thermostat 250 is a conventional mechanical or electronic thermostat,
     input from sensors 220 may result in an adjustment to the set point of
     thermostat 250. On the other hand, thermostat 250 may use the various
     temperature readings from sensors 220 as an input temperature to be
     compared against a defined set point or set points.
10   [00119]       Furthermore, network system 200 can sense disparities
     between various sensors 220 as the house is heated and cooled using
     central cooling device 232 and central heating device 242. Based on the
     data collected, a processor can determine whether efficiency and/or comfort
     may be optimized by adding a local cooling or heating device to one or more
15   rooms of the house. The processor may be extent in one of the components
     of network system 200, such as one of I/C devices 210, for example, or in a
     remote server accessible to network system 200. For example, analysis of
     the data provided from sensors 220 may indicate that one of the bedrooms
     in the house is much colder than the rest of the house during the winter
20   months. Optimization of the HVAC system may, therefore, call for a local
     heating device to be placed in that room that can be controlled individually
     to make that room comfortable while avoiding overheating the rest of the
     house.
     [00120]       Analyzing the data provided by sensors 220 to determine
25   whether one or more local heating or cooling devices should be supplied to
     optimize comfort and efficiency in the building served by network
     system 200 may include, for example: determining the difference between
     the temperature reading for each sensor 220 in network system 200 and
     the other sensors (e.g., with reference to the average and/or median
                                          - 44 -

     temperature sensed by all sensors 220 or the balance of the sensors) in
     network system 200 over a wide range of temperatures; comparing the
     humidity detected by each sensor 220 with the other sensors in network
     system 200; calculating the necessary power ratings for a local heating
 5   and/or cooling devices that may be used to supplement central cooling
     device 232 and central heating device 242; calculating the return-on
     investment ("ROI") for supplementing central cooling device 232 and
     central heating device 242 with suggested local heating and cooling devices
     based at least on the up-front cost of the suggested local heating and
10   cooling devices, their projected energy usage costs, and the cost associated
     with overheating or overcooling to compensate for particularly hot or cold
     rooms.
     [00121]       In some embodiments, it may be possible to adjust the output
     of central cooling device 232 and/or central heating device 242 at various
15   points throughout network system 200 without the addition of local
     heating or cooling devices. For instance, vents in communication with
     ducts of central cooling device 232 and/or central heating device 242 may
     be individually controllable to adjust the delivery of conditioned air to
     particular areas of the house. If each vent is equipped with an adaptor,
20   such as adaptor 140 of FIG. 1, for example, configured to receive control
     signals from the other network, the vents may opened or closed as
     necessary to achieve better localized control of the climate throughout the
     building served by network system 200.
     [00122]       It should be understood that while the example provided
25   above involved a network having central heating and cooling devices,
     similar climate control may be implemented using a network having only
     local heating and cooling devices.
     [00123]       During operation of network system 200, the network
     components can work together to efficiently provide HVAC control to the

     entire building. HVAC control may be exercised a number of ways
     depending on the components available in network system 200, including:
     (1) communicating a new set point to thermostat 250; (2) communicating
     with a remote server-based interface to an energy control system
 5   connected to network system 200 via a wireless or wired outside network
     connection; (3) communication directly to the control panel of central
     cooling device 232 and/or central heating device 242; and (4)
     communication directly to one or more local cooling devices 230 and/or
     local heating devices 240. Accordingly, network system 200 may have the
10   ability to manage whole-house comfort without or in conjunction with a
     central heating or air conditioning system, and even without traditional
     thermostatic control for heating and cooling.

     protocols, and methods for controlling target devices, it is to be understood
15   that many changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit
