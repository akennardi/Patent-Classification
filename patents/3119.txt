     METHODOLOGY
    ABSTRACT
  5
    The main purpose of the invention is to provide manufactures of sauces with a way of selling a
    variety multi-pack of their sauces, thereby encouraging the sauce user to buy a range of their sauces,
    rather than different sauces from different brands, and subsequently repurchase their sauces
    regularly.
 .0
    This is achieved by offering the sauce user a value-add caddy device as part of a multi-pack of
    sauces. The caddy offers the user a practical way of storing and presenting a range of sauces at any
    meal occasion, whether in the home, outdoor entertaining or in a commercial food service situation
    - restaurant, caf6 etc.
 .5
    The caddy is design in a way that it could be customised to fit a particular brand of sauces, so it is not
    aimed to be a generic sauces caddy, but rather a caddy for a specific brand to help promote that
    brands usage and repurchase.
20  The caddy is moulded out of plastic and has three location positions or cups for three bottles of
    sauce. The caddy has a handle which makes it easy for the end user to carry the caddy to the table.
    The caddy would be prepacked by the manufacturer with three different sauces - typically Tomato,
    BBQ and Sweet Chilli. Other combinations could also be offered, or the caddy might also include
    additional locations or cups for salt and pepper.

     METHODOLOGY
    BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
  5 FIELD
    This invention is in the field of food flavour enhancement, sauces and seasoning products. More
    particularly, the present invention provides a caddy that enables multiple variants of liquid sauces to
    be more easily stored and transported to the table at home, outdoors or in a commercial food
 .0 service environment.
    The main purpose of the caddy is as a promotional vehicle to enable the manufacture to prepack a
    range of sauces that will help drive purchases and consumption.
 .5 BACKGROUND
    A wide variety of liquid sauce and flavour enhancement products are used to add flavour and taste
    to meals and snacks. Most often these products are provided in plastic squeezable bottles with
    twist-open dispenser closures. The most common types of sauces are tomato sauce, chilli sauce,
20  barbeque sauce, steak sauce, worcestershire sauce, mustards, mayonnaise and salad dressing.
    Several manufacturers operate in this marketplace and compete directly on supermarket shelves for
    the consumer to buy their brand and continue buying their brand versus other brands. One way to
    win consumer choice is to offer an additional function or service that will attract the consumer to
25  one brand versus another. A caddy pre-packed with a range of sauces would offers the user a unique

                                               Strictly Confidential
    added value item that would positively influence brand choice in favour of one brand versus
    another.
    This added value caddy is design to attract user to a specific brand, and because only that brand fits
 0  into the caddy, users will want to continue buying that brand rather than another brand that does
    not fit the caddy.
    In addition, this invention also could include pumps dispensers that would offer the additional
    convenience of allowing the user to dispense a sauce without having to remove the bottle from the
  5 caddy.
