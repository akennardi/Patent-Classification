SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING
ALERT NOTIFICATIONS TO A VEHICLE OCCUPANT
[0001] The present application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2013357346,
the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The present application
is also related to PCT Application No. PCT/EP2013/076249 (WO 2014/090884) and GB
Application No. GB 1222198.2, filed respectively on 11 December 2013 and 11 December
2012. The contents of the related applications are incorporated herein by reference in their
entirety.
Technical Field
[0002] The present invention relates to the provision of an alert notification to the occupant of a
vehicle, and is concerned particularly, although not exclusively, with a low cost system and
method for providing relevant travel, e.g. traffic event, messages to a vehicle occupant using an
existing wireless communications network and an in-vehicle radio receiver.
Background
[0003] Navigation devices, such as Portable Navigation Devices (PNDs) or built-in satellite
navigation devices, are commonly employed in automobiles to calculate travel routes and to
provide guidance along said routes. Navigation devices are typically provided with the
functionality to wirelessly receive travel information such as traffic events, accidents, closed
roads and the like, in order, for example, to utilise the information to determine travel routes that
take account of delays on the road network between an origin and destination. Although the
route calculation and navigation functions are fundamental to the overall utility of PNDs, it is
also possible to use the device purely for information display, or "free-driving", in which only
map and travel information relevant to the current device location is displayed, and in which no
route has been calculated and no navigation is currently being performed by the device. Such a
mode of operation is often applicable when the user already knows the route along which it is
desired to travel and does not require navigation assistance.
[0004] The travel information that is provided to such navigation devices can come directly
from governmental agencies, and, for example, can be in the form of TMC (Traffic Message
Channel) messages that are typically broadcast using conventional FM radio, or more recently

                                                  2
on digital radio and satellite radio channels. RDS-TMC is currently an International standard
for delivery of traffic information to navigation devices. Due to the low bandwidth available in
the RDS-TMC system, it is only possible to provide travel information in relation to significant
road junctions along defined portions of the road network, e.g. national and regional highways.
More specifically, in the RDS-TMC system, travel information is encoded using a set of a
predefined event codes and location tables, which assign a location code to each of the road
junctions within a region. The encoded TMC messages are broadcast, and decoded by a RDS
TMC receiver, such as one associated with a navigation device, by matching event and location
codes against one or more look-up tables. As known in the art, such RDS-TMC receivers can
be internal within the navigation device, or can be combined with an external antenna that is
connectable to the navigation device (e.g. see WO 2011/072714 Al).
 [0005] In part due to the limitations of RDS-TMC, travel information has been provided by
real-time traffic monitoring systems utilising various technologies, such as mobile phone data
exchanges (e.g. see WO 02/45046 A2), fixed cameras, GPS fleet tracking. One example of such
a real-time traffic monitoring system is the TomTom HD Traffic service, created and provided
by TomTom International B.V., which fuses data from multiple sources, including cellular
floating phone data, GPS-based probe data and conventional data feeds from third parties, such
as local authorities, and data from loop systems in the road, to create significantly more accurate
and detailed travel event data. In the case of the TomTom HD Traffic Service, rather than
broadcasting messages, a bi-directional mobile telecommunication channel, such as GPRS,
GSM, or the like, is used to provide the travel information to navigation devices. This provides
a greater available data bandwidth than is available in RDS-TMC, and, together with the use of
a dynamic location referencing system, such as OpenLR, which allows an event to be associated
with any location on a digital map (and not just pre-coded locations), enables the provision of
travel information at a more granular level.
 [0006] Many built-in vehicle navigation devices, i.e. that are integrated into the vehicle system,
and many older navigation devices are not, however, capable of establishing a connection with a
mobile telecommunications network, and thus are unable to receive the higher quality travel
information provided by suppliers, such as TomTom International B.V. or INRIX, Inc. The
Applicant has therefore recognised that it would be desirable to provide a solution to allow the
travel information from such suppliers to be received by these built-in or older navigation

                                                  3
devices. Furthermore, the Applicant has recognised that it would also be beneficial to provide a
solution to allow travel information to be provided to drivers that do not own a navigation
device.
Summary
[0007] In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an electronic
device for providing travel information to an occupant of a vehicle, the electronic device
comprising a housing and a plug extending therefrom, the plug being insertable into an in
vehicle power supply socket for providing power to the electronic device, the housing
comprising: means for determining a position of the electronic device; a network transceiver for
communicating with a wireless telecommunications network; a global navigation satellite
system (GNSS) receiver; a radio transmitter; an actuator on an external surface of the housing of
the electronic device; and at least one inertial measurement unit (IMU) for determining when the
vehicle remains stationary for a predetermined period of time; wherein the GNSS receiver is
arranged, in use, to determine a position of the electronic device, and wherein the network
transceiver is arranged, in use, to communicate with a remote server via the network to receive
travel information from the remote server via the network based on the determined position and
arranged to disconnect from the network when the vehicle is determined to remain stationary for
the predetermined period of time, and wherein the radio transmitter is arranged, in use, to
transmit the received travel information to an in-vehicle radio receiver unit, and wherein the
actuator is arranged to, upon being actuated, cause the radio transmitter to retransmit a most
recently received travel information to the in-vehicle radio receiver unit through a connection
separate from the wireless telecommunications network.
[0008] In accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an
electronic device for providing travel information to an occupant of a vehicle, the electronic
device comprising a housing and a plug formed in the housing and extending therefrom, the
plug being insertable into an in-vehicle power supply socket for providing power to the
electronic device, the housing comprising: means for determining a position of the electronic
device; a network transceiver for communicating with a wireless telecommunications network; a
radio transmitter; an actuator on an external surface of the housing of the electronic device; and
at least one inertial measurement unit (IMU) for determining when the vehicle remains
stationary for a predetermined period of time; wherein the network transceiver is arranged, in

                                                   4
use, to communicate with a remote server via the network for determining a position of the
electronic device and to receive travel information from the remote server via the network based
on the determined position and arranged to disconnect from the network when the vehicle is
determined to remain stationary for the predetermined period of time, and wherein the radio
transmitter is arranged, in use, to transmit the received travel information to an in-vehicle radio
receiver unit, and wherein the actuator is arranged to, upon being actuated, cause the radio
transmitter to retransmit a most recently received travel information to the in-vehicle radio
receiver unit through a connection separate from the wireless telecommunications network.
[0009] In accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a method
for providing travel information to an occupant of a vehicle using an electronic device
comprising a housing and a plug formed in the housing and extending therefrom, the plug being
insertable into an in-vehicle power supply socket for providing power to the electronic device,
the method comprising: determining a geographic position of the electronic device using a
global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver within the housing of the electronic device;
determining the travel information at a remote server based on the determined geographic
position of the electronic device and transmitting said determined travel information via a
wireless telecommunications network for receipt by a network transceiver in the electronic
device; receiving travel information from a remote server via a wireless telecommunications
network using a network transceiver, said travel information being determined based on the
determined geographic position of the electronic device; transmitting the received travel
information to an in-vehicle radio receiver unit using a radio transmitter within the housing of
the electronic device for output to the vehicle occupant; determining when the vehicle remains
stationary for a predetermined period of time using the GNSS receiver and disconnecting from
the network when the vehicle is determined to remain stationary for the predetermined period of
time; and retransmitting the most recently received travel information to the in-vehicle radio
receiver unit through a connection separate from the wireless telecommunications network upon
receiving an indication that an actuator on an external surface of the electronic device has been
actuated.
[00010] In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an electronic
device for providing travel information to an occupant of a vehicle, the electronic device
comprising a housing and a plug extending therefrom, the plug being insertable into an in-

                                                  5
vehicle power supply socket for providing power to the electronic device, the housing
comprising: a network transceiver for communicating with a wireless telecommunications
network; and a radio transmitter, wherein the network transceiver is arranged, in use, to
communicate with a remote server via the network for determining a position of the electronic
device and to receive travel information from the remote server via the network based on the
determined position, and wherein the radio transmitter is arranged, in use, to transmit the
received travel information to an in-vehicle radio receiver unit.
[00011] There is also provided an electronic device connectable to an in-vehicle power supply,
and which is capable of bi-directional communication with a remote server via a wireless
telecommunications network. The electronic device further comprises a radio transmitter for
transmitting information received from the remote server, thereby allowing the device to
function as an in-vehicle radio broadcasting device.
[00012] In one set of aspects the network transceiver is arranged to communicate with a remote
server via the network to determine a position of the electronic device. For example, the
network transceiver may comprise a GSM or GPRS mobile telecommunications device. In
addition, or alternatively, the device may comprise a global navigation satellite system (GNSS)
receiver such as a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. The GPS receiver may be
arranged, in use, to determine a position of the electronic device. The Applicant has realised
that it can be beneficial to utilise a GPS device in addition to, or instead of, a GSM or GPRS
device to improve positioning accuracy for the electronic device.
[0010] Thus in accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an
electronic device for providing travel information to an occupant of a vehicle, the electronic
device comprising a housing and a plug extending therefrom, the plug being insertable into an
in-vehicle power supply socket for providing power to the electronic device, the housing
comprising: a network transceiver for communicating with a wireless telecommunications
network; a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver; and a radio transmitter, wherein
the GNSS receiver is arranged, in use, to determine a position of the electronic device and the
network transceiver is arranged, in use, to communicate with a remote server via the network for
receiving travel information from the remote server via the network based on the determined
position, and wherein the radio transmitter is arranged, in use, to transmit the received travel
information to an in-vehicle radio receiver unit.

                                                  6
[0011] It will be appreciated that using a GNSS, e.g. GPS, receiver to determine a position of
the electronic device can be more accurate than relying on mobile network positioning
information alone. An advantage of using the GNSS, e.g. GPS, receiver for positioning is that
the network transceiver need only receive travel information and not positional information, so
the amount of data transmitted via the wireless telecommunications network can be reduced.
However, it is envisaged that in at least some aspects the network transceiver may also be
arranged, in use, to communicate with a remote server via the network for determining a
position of the electronic device. A hybrid positioning technique such as assisted GPS (A-GPS)
can be helpful under certain conditions, for example using network resources to locate the GPS
satellites in poor signal conditions, to improve the start-up performance of the device.
[0012] Thus in more general terms it will be appreciated that the present disclosure provides an
electronic device that acts as a gateway for travel information to be transferred from a remote
server to an in-vehicle radio receiver unit based on a determined position of the electronic
device. The geographic position of the electronic device may be determined by various means.
[0013] In accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an
electronic device for providing travel information to an occupant of a vehicle, the electronic
device comprising a housing and a plug extending therefrom, the plug being insertable into an
in-vehicle power supply socket for providing power to the electronic device, the housing
comprising: means for determining a position of the electronic device; a network transceiver for
communicating with a wireless telecommunications network; and a radio transmitter, wherein
the network transceiver is arranged, in use, to communicate with a remote server via the network
to receive travel information from the remote server via the network based on the determined
position, and wherein the radio transmitter is arranged, in use, to transmit the received travel
information to an in-vehicle radio receiver unit.
[0014] In various aspects of the present disclosure, the means for determining a position of the
electronic device may comprise a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver in the
electronic device and/or the network transceiver in the electronic device being arranged, in use,
to communicate with a remote server via the network for determining a position of the electronic
device. The network transceiver may periodically receive travel information from the remote
server via the network based on the determined position. For example, the remote server may
be programmed to send updated travel information every two minutes whenever a network

                                                   7
connection is established with the device. Especially where the position of the electronic device
is determined, at least partly, by a GNSS receiver in the electronic device, then the network
transceiver may be arranged, in use, to communicate the determined position of the device to the
remote server so that the server can determine whether updated travel information is available
based on the determined position. For example, the electronic device may be programmed to
send its determined position to the remote server periodically, e.g. every two minutes, whenever
a network connection is established. The server may then use the determined position to
identify any relevant traffic information and send an update when appropriate. It will be
appreciated that the device determining its own position using a GNSS receiver means that
travel information can be better tailored to a vehicle's location in real time and the burden on the
network connection may be reduced. In some examples the network transceiver may be
arranged, in use, to demand travel information from the remote server based on the determined
position. For example, the network transceiver may send its determined position to the remote
server more frequently when the device determines that its position is changing rapidly.
[0015] The plug of the electronic device preferably comprises a cigarette lighter adapter (CLA),
which is insertable into a vehicle cigarette lighter socket. It will be appreciated, however, that
the plug could be of any suitable form, and could, for example, comprise a universal serial bus
(USB) plug insertable into an in-vehicle USB socket.
[0016] The network transceiver preferably comprises a modem, such as a GPRS or GSM
modem, capable of communicating with a mobile telecommunication network. The network
transceiver therefore preferably comprises a subscriber identity module (SIM) for receiving a
SIM card for subscription to a wireless telecommunications network.
[0017] The radio transmitter may comprise an analogue radio transmitter, such as a FM
transmitter. The FM transmitter preferably comprises an FM RDS transmitter, i.e. comprises an
Radio Data System (RDS) encoder. Alternatively the radio transmitter may comprise a digital
radio transmitter, such as a DAB radio or HD radio transmitter. Preferably the radio transmitter
is arranged to transmit the received travel information at FM or DAB radio frequencies between
about 30 and 2000 MHz. The FM frequency band is 88.1 - 108.1 MHz while DAB typically
uses spectra that have been allocated in Band III (174-240 MHz) and L band (1452-1492
MHz). It will be understood that such a radio transmitter can be distinguished from a Bluetooth
transmitter that is arranged to broadcast over short distances using frequencies in the ISM band

                                                    8
from 2400 - 2480 MHz. However, it is discussed below that the electronic device may
optionally comprise an additional short-range, e.g. Bluetooth, communication unit to enable
communication with another device such as a mobile telephone or "smart" phone, separately
from communication with an in-vehicle radio receiver unit.
[0018] As will be appreciated, each of the components of the electronic device will be operably
connected, directly or indirectly, to allow for the transfer of power and/or data therebetween. It
will also be appreciated that the electronic device will comprise one or more processing units
programmed in a manner to support the operation of the device, and one or more memory units.
[0019] The electronic device may, in aspects, further comprise a socket to which an external
device can be physically connected, e.g. to allow power and/or data transfer to the external
device (such as for charging thereof). The socket may of any type as desired, but preferably
comprises one or more USB ports.
[0020] The electronic device may, in aspects, comprise one or more status indicators, such as
LEDs. The status indicators can be used to indicate the current status of the device to the user,
e.g. active, inactive, currently receiving a traffic message, etc.
[0021] In some aspects of the present disclosure, the network transceiver is arranged, in use, to
communicate with a remote server via the network for determining a position of the electronic
device, either alone or in combination with a GNSS receiver. In preferred aspects, at least an
approximate location is determined by the network transceiver, which is communicated to the
remote server whereupon a more accurate position can be determined. The approximate
location can be, for example, a cell ID of the telecommunications network. Thus, for example,
in some aspects, the network transceiver can be arranged to communicate location information
to the remote server indicative of the position of the network transceiver (and thus the electronic
device, and correspondingly the vehicle in which the electronic device is carried). In addition,
or alternatively, the electronic device may comprise a GNSS receiver that is arranged to
determine the position of the device, and hence of the vehicle. This location information can
then be used by the remote server to determine relevant travel information based on the current
position of the vehicle; the determined travel information being transmitted by the remote server
to the electronic device. The term "travel information" is used herein to refer information or

                                                  9
messages about events effecting the flow of traffic along roads. The messages may relate, in
examples, to traffic, weather, accidents, black spots, speed cameras, etc.
[0022] Although in some preferred aspects, the position of the electronic device is determined in
an hybrid manner, i.e. using approximate location information transmitted from the network
transceiver, which is then refined at the remote server, it will be appreciated that the position of
the electronic device can be determined using the connection between the network transceiver
and the wireless telecommunications network wholly at the network transceiver or at the remote
server. Further details concerning the manner by which the position of the electronic device can
be determined using the connection between the network transceiver and the wireless
telecommunications network can be found in WO 02/45046 A2; the entire content of which is
incorporated herein by reference.
[0023] In some other preferred aspects the position of the electronic device is determined in an
hybrid manner, i.e. using approximate location information transmitted from the network
transceiver and more exact location information determined by a GNSS receiver. In some other
preferred aspects the position of the electronic device is determined wholly by a GNSS receiver.
[0024] As will be appreciated, the position of the electronic device will be continually
determined as the vehicle travels along the road network. The determined position of the
vehicle over time can be used by the remote server to determine other attributes of the vehicle,
such as one or more of heading, speed, and a predicted route of travel.
[0025] The remote server forms part of a real-time traffic monitoring system, and thus
comprises a database of travel information for a road network, such as traffic jams, accidents,
closed roads, etc; said database continuously being updated using information from a plurality
of vehicles currently traversing the road network. Accordingly, at the remote server, the
determined position of the electronic device on the road network can be used to collect relevant
travel information for the vehicle carrying the electronic device. In aspects, the determined
heading, speed and/or predicted route of travel can also be used to determine the relevant travel
information for the vehicle.
[0026] The travel information deemed relevant for a vehicle can be any travel information
within a geographic area around, or ahead of, the current position of the vehicle. The

                                                   10
geographic area can be of any shape, e.g. circular, square, etc. For example, the geographic area
can be centred at the current position of the vehicle. Alternatively, the geographic area can be
located such that the current position of the vehicle is at the edge of the area, and the area
extends outwards along a determined heading of the vehicle. The size of the geographic area
can be predefined, e.g. a default size could be used for all users. Alternatively, in other aspects,
a user may be able to select a desired size of the geographic area.
 [0027] The travel information deemed relevant for a vehicle can be limited to roads of a
particular importance, e.g. of a certain functional road class. For example, one user may only
want to receive travel information for major highways, but not minor roads, while another user
may want to receive travel information for all roads regardless of functional road class.
 [0028] The remote server preferably therefore comprises a database of users and associated user
preferences, e.g. desired size of geographic area, functional road classes for which information
is desired, etc, and these user preferences are used to determine the relevant travel information
for an electronic device.
 [0029] Once the relevant travel, e.g. traffic, information for a vehicle has been determined, a
traffic message for the vehicle is created, and preferably stored, at the remote server. In
preferred aspects, the traffic message has an associated expiration time, e.g. a number of
minutes, such that a new traffic message is created once the expiration time has elapsed. As will
be appreciated, each traffic message is preferably stored at the remote server with an identifier
representative of the vehicle for the which the traffic message has been created.
 [0030] The created traffic message can be in any suitable format as desired, e.g. based on how
the traffic message is to be used by the electronic device. For example, the created traffic
message can be in the form of a text message, e.g. "traffic on the road ahead for the next two
junctions" or the like. The created traffic message may also be encoded in a standard format,
such as TMC, Alert-C or TPEG, or in a proprietary format, such as one used by TomTom or
INRIX to transmit travel information. As will be appreciated, whilst the travel information is of
a high accuracy, the level of detail of the travel information in the traffic message varies based
on the format of the message. For example, when the traffic message is a text message, the
travel information is of a low level of detail. Conversely, when the traffic message is in a

                                                 11
format that utilise a dynamic location referencing system, such as OpenLR, the travel
information is of a high level of detail.
[0031] As discussed above, the remote server is arranged to transmit the created traffic message
to the electronic device via the wireless telecommunications network for receipt by the network
transceiver. Typically, the traffic messages are "pushed" to the electronic device from the
server (while the electronic device is connected to the network). However, it is also envisaged
that traffic messages can, in some aspects, also be "pulled" from the remote server. For
example, in aspects, the electronic device may comprise a user interface means, such as an
actuator, preferably in the form of a push button, for requesting the most recent traffic message
to be sent to the network transceiver.
[0032] The electronic device may be arranged to be active whenever it is connected to a power
source, i.e. the in-vehicle power supply. In other words, the network transceiver is arranged to
be connected to the wireless telecommunications network, when the network is available,
whenever power is received via the plug of the device.
[0033] In a preferred aspect, the electronic device comprises means for determining when the
vehicle (and thus electronic device) is stopped for at least a predetermined period of time, and
thus no longer requires travel information to be received. Such a means has a substantial benefit
of bandwidth consumption, since otherwise any powered electronic device in a parked vehicle
would continue to receive travel information.
[0034] In a set of aspects, the electronic device comprises one or more inertial measurement
units (IMUs), such as one or more accelerometers, gyroscopes and the like, to monitor
movements (velocity, orientation, etc) of the electronic device. When the measurements from
the one or more IMUs detect that the vehicle in which the electronic device is stationary, or
remains stationary for more than a predetermined period of time, then the network transceiver is
arranged to be disconnected from the wireless telecommunications network. In another set of
aspects, such IMUs may not be needed to determine when the electronic device is stationery
where a GNSS receiver is provided to determine positional information for the device.
Accordingly the network transceiver may be arranged to disconnect from the network when the
GNSS receiver determines that the vehicle remains stationary for a predetermined period of
time. Similarly, upon a determination that the vehicle is moving again, then the network

                                                  12
transceiver is arranged to reconnect to the network using the at least one inertial measurement
unit (IMU) or GNSS receiver.
[0035] In other aspects, alternatively or in addition, the remote server can be arranged to
determine from the position, and optionally heading, velocity, etc, of the electronic device that
the vehicle carrying the device is stationary, or has remained stationary for more than a
predetermined period of time. When the remote server determines than the vehicle is and/or
remains stationary, then it can be arranged to stop transmitting travel information to the device
until such a time as the vehicle to begin moving again.
[0036] The electronic device may further comprise a short-range communication unit for
enabling communication with an additional communication device having a display and a user
interface, such as a mobile telephone, smart phone, tablet computer or the like. The short-range
communication unit may comprise a Bluetooth device or a WiFi device. Such a short-range
communication unit allows a user to input and/or adjust preferences and other settings of the
system. For example, the user can utilise the user interface of the additional communication
device to input and/or adjust one or more preferences in relation to determining the relevance of
travel information at the remote server, e.g. the size of the geographic area, functional road
classes for which travel information is desired, etc. Any input user preferences are
communicated to the remote server via a telecommunications network as required by the
additional communication device. Similarly, the user can utilise the user interface to input
and/or adjust one or more preferences in relation to the manner by which received travel
information is used by the electronic device. For example, and as will be discussed in more
detail below, a user may select a voice to be used to audibly announce received travel
information. Any input user preferences are communicated to the electronic device as required
by the additional communication device using a short-range communication unit.
[0037] It is also envisaged that the user could input and/or adjust one or more preferences in
relation to determining the relevance of travel information at the remote server, using a web
portal accessible by a client device, such as a computer, that is not in communication with the
electronic device.
[0038] In the present disclosure, the radio transmitter of the electronic device is arranged to
transmit, i.e. broadcast, the travel information received from the remote server to an in-vehicle

                                                  13
radio receiver unit. In preferred aspects, the travel information will be broadcast in the format
that is received from the remote server. Thus, for example, if the travel information is received
in the form of a text message, e.g. using the unstructured supplementary serve data (USSD)
protocol, then it will be retransmitted by the radio transmitter in the form of a text message. It is
also envisaged, albeit in less preferred aspects, however, that the travel information will be
received in a first format from the remote server, converted into a second format at the
electronic device, and then broadcast by the radio transmitter in the second format. For
example, in such aspects, travel information may be received by the electronic device in a
proprietary format, and then converted into a standard format, such as a TMC or Alert-C
message (using predefined location reference tables stored in a memory of the electronic
device).
[0039] In an aspect of the present disclosure, the in-vehicle radio receiver unit to which the
received travel information is broadcast comprises a vehicle audio system, which will typically
be integrated in the vehicle. The vehicle audio system preferably comprises a RDS radio
receiver, such that it can decode information received over RDS channels. In this aspect, the
radio transmitter of the electronic device preferably transmits the travel information, preferably
in the form of a text message, using the Traffic Programme Identification (TP) and/or Traffic
Announcements (TA) RDS channels.
[0040] The vehicle audio system may be arranged, in some aspects, to display the received
travel information as text on a display of the audio system. Alternatively, or in addition, the
vehicle audio system may be arranged to output the received travel information audibly,
preferably in spoken form, using one or more speakers of the audio system. In a preferred
aspect, the vehicle audio system therefore comprises a text-to-speech (TTS) capability.
[0041] In such aspects, an interface means, e.g. actuator, of the electronic device may be used,
when actuated by a user, to cause the radio transmitter to rebroadcast the last traffic message
obtained from the remote server. This allows the vehicle occupant to cause the last traffic
message to again be displayed and/or spoken on the vehicle audio system.
[0042] The radio receiver may comprise an RDS radio receiver for receiving, for example, TMC
messages (i.e. an RDS-TMC receiver) or messages in another standard format, such as TPEG or
Alert-C messages. Thus, the radio transmitter of the electronic device preferably transmits the

                                                  14
travel information in these aspects in a standard format, such as TMC or TPEG. The RDS-TMC
receiver may be configured to decode TMC messages that are received from the electronic
device. A benefit of transmitting TMC or TPEG messages to the in-vehicle radio receiver unit
is that the coded feed can be received without interrupting audio output, unlike TP or TA traffic
announcements that cut into a radio broadcast.
[0043] As is mentioned above, the radio transmitter preferably comprises an analogue FM RDS
transmitter but may take the form of a digital e.g. DAB transmitter. The in-vehicle radio
receiver unit may be arranged to receive FM radio or even digital (e.g. DAB) or satellite radio.
In future it is envisaged that FM radio channels may be replaced with digital or satellite radio. It
is possible that TMC messages could be transmitted directly from the electronic device to a
digital e.g. DAB radio receiver unit. Preferably the in-vehicle radio receiver unit is arranged to
receive travel information at FM or DAB radio frequencies between about 30 and 2000 MHz.
[0044] In another aspect of the present disclosure, the in-vehicle radio receiver unit to which the
received travel information is broadcast comprises a vehicle navigation device having an
integrated radio receiver or a radio receiver in an external antenna connected to a vehicle
navigation device. The navigation device may be integrated in the vehicle, or may be a portable
navigation device that can be removably mounted within the vehicle. The navigation devices in
these aspects, as will be appreciated, typically do not comprise a network transceiver that can be
used to connect the device to the remote server of the present disclosure and/or a short-range
communication unit that can be used to pair the navigation device to another device, e.g. a
mobile telephone, having such a network transceiver. Portable navigation devices may include
portable, e.g. tablet computers that do not have a network connection, for example a tablet that
is GPS-enabled but does not comprise a modem and/or SIM card.
[0045] The navigation device may be arranged, in some aspects, to use the received travel
information in addition to, or instead of, travel information received from other sources. For
example, the navigation device may display the received travel information on a display and/or
the navigation device may utilise the travel information when determining a route to be followed
between an origin and a destination. The navigation device may be arranged, in some aspects,
to display the received travel information as text and/or graphics on a display.

                                                  15
[0046] The electronic device may be arranged to allow a user to find and/or select an available
radio channel that can be used to transmit, i.e. broadcast the received travel information to the
in-vehicle radio receiver unit. For example, a manual input interface of the electronic device
may be used to tune the broadcast channel of the radio transmitter. However it can be
distracting and potentially dangerous for a vehicle driver to tune the device. In a vehicle, the
available radio channels will typically change constantly as the vehicle moves in and out of
range of different radio stations. Furthermore, changes in the landscape can temporarily block
radio signals and cause confusion. It is therefore preferable that the electronic device is
arranged, in use, to identify an available radio channel that can be used to transmit the received
travel information to the in-vehicle radio receiver unit. Preferably the electronic device is able
to automatically select a transmission channel. The electronic device may be arranged, in use,
to employ a method of identifying a radio transmission frequency as disclosed, for example, in
US 2009/0130978 Al; the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
[0047] The present disclosure further extends to a system comprising the electronic device and
any one or more of the additional devices, servers and the like mentioned above.
[0048] Thus, for example, in accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure, there is
provided a system for providing travel information to an occupant of the vehicle, the system
comprising: an electronic device positionable in a vehicle; and a remote server comprising
means for determining a geographic position of the electronic device, the electronic device
comprising a housing and a plug extending therefrom, the plug being insertable into an in
vehicle power supply socket for providing power to the electronic device, and the housing
comprising: a network transceiver for communicating with a wireless telecommunications
network; and a radio transmitter, wherein the network transceiver is arranged, in use, to receive
travel information from the remote server via the network based on the determined position, and
wherein the radio transmitter is arranged, in use, to transmit the received travel information to an
in-vehicle radio receiver unit.
[0049] In accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a system
for providing travel information to an occupant of a vehicle, the system comprising: an
electronic device positionable in the vehicle; and an in-vehicle radio receiver unit comprising
means for audio and/or visual output of travel information to the vehicle occupant, the electronic
device comprising a housing and a plug extending therefrom, the plug being insertable into an

                                                 16
in-vehicle power supply socket for providing power to the electronic device, and the housing
comprising: a network transceiver for communicating with a wireless telecommunications
network; and a radio transmitter, wherein the network transceiver is arranged, in use, to
communicate with a remote server via the network for determining a position of the electronic
device and to receive travel information from the remote server via the network based on the
determined position, and wherein the radio transmitter is arranged, in use, to transmit the
received travel information to the in-vehicle radio receiver unit.
[0050] In accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a system
for providing travel information to an occupant of a vehicle, the system comprising: an
electronic device positionable in the vehicle; a remote server comprising means for determining
a geographic position of the electronic device; and an in-vehicle radio receiver unit comprising
means for audio and/or visual output of travel information to the vehicle occupant, the electronic
device comprising a housing and a plug extending therefrom, the plug being insertable into an
in-vehicle power supply socket for providing power to the electronic device, and the housing
comprising: a network transceiver for communicating with a wireless telecommunications
network; and a radio transmitter, wherein the network transceiver is arranged, in use, to receive
travel information from the remote server via the network based on the determined position, and
wherein the radio transmitter is arranged, in use, to transmit the received travel information to
the in-vehicle radio receiver unit.
[0051] In such systems the network transceiver communicates with a remote server via a
wireless telecommunications network to determine a geographic position of the electronic
device. This means that the electronic device does not necessarily have its own positioning
system. However, as is described above, the electronic device may employ a hybrid positioning
system that combines position information from a remote server with locally determined
position information, for example using a GNSS receiver in the electronic device. More
generally, various aspects of the present disclosure relate to a system in which the electronic
device comprises means for determining a position of the electronic device.
[0052] In accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a system
for providing travel information to an occupant of a vehicle, the system comprising: an
electronic device positionable in the vehicle; and a remote server arranged to provide travel

electronic device; the electronic device comprising a housing and a plug extending therefrom,
the plug being insertable into an in-vehicle power supply socket for providing power to the
electronic device, the housing comprising: means for determining a position of the electronic
device; a network transceiver for communicating with a wireless telecommunications network;
and a radio transmitter; wherein the network transceiver is arranged, in use, to communicate
with the remote server via the network to receive travel information from the remote server via
the network based on the determined position, and wherein the radio transmitter is arranged, in
use, to transmit the received travel information to an in-vehicle radio receiver unit.
[0053] In accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a system
for providing travel information to an occupant of a vehicle, the system comprising: an
electronic device positionable in the vehicle; and an in-vehicle radio receiver unit comprising
means for audio and/or visual output of travel information to the vehicle occupant; the electronic
device comprising a housing and a plug extending therefrom, the plug being insertable into an
in-vehicle power supply socket for providing power to the electronic device, the housing
comprising: means for determining a position of the electronic device; a network transceiver for
communicating with a wireless telecommunications network; and a radio transmitter; wherein
the network transceiver is arranged, in use, to communicate with a remote server via the network
to receive travel information from the remote server via the network based on the determined
position, and wherein the radio transmitter is arranged, in use, to transmit the received travel
information to the in-vehicle radio receiver unit.
[0054] In accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a system
for providing travel information to an occupant of a vehicle, the system comprising: an
electronic device positionable in the vehicle; a remote server arranged to provide travel
information based on the determined position of the electronic device and to transmit said travel
information via a wireless telecommunications network to the network transceiver in the
electronic device; and an in-vehicle radio receiver unit comprising means for audio and/or visual
output of travel information to the vehicle occupant; the electronic device comprising a housing
and a plug extending therefrom, the plug being insertable into an in-vehicle power supply socket
for providing power to the electronic device, the housing comprising: means for determining a
position of the electronic device; a network transceiver for communicating with a wireless

                                                  18
telecommunications network; and a radio transmitter; wherein the network transceiver is
arranged, in use, to communicate with the remote server via the network to receive travel
information from the remote server via the network based on the determined position, and
wherein the radio transmitter is arranged, in use, to transmit the received travel information to
the in-vehicle radio receiver unit.
[0055] In such systems the means for determining a position of the electronic device may utilise
local and/or remote determination of geographic position. In a set of aspects the electronic
device comprises a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver for determining a
geographic position of the electronic device. Alternatively, or in addition, in a set of aspects the
remote server comprises means for determining a geographic position of the electronic device.
[0056] The present disclosure in these further aspects may include any of the optional and
preferred features described in relation to the above aspects of the present disclosure. For
example, the in-vehicle radio receiver unit may comprise a vehicle audio system or a navigation
device. Similarly, the travel information may include information about traffic jams, road
accidents, road closures or the like.
[0057] In accordance with another further aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a
method for providing travel information to an occupant of a vehicle, the method comprising:
        determining a geographic position of an electronic device positioned in the vehicle based
on communications over a wireless telecommunications network between a network transceiver
in the electronic device and a remote server;
        determining travel information at the remote server based on the determined geographic
position and transmitting said determined travel information via the network for receipt by the
network transceiver;
        transmitting the received travel information to an in-vehicle radio receiver unit using a
radio transmitter in the electronic device; and
        outputting the travel information received at the in-vehicle radio receiver unit to the
vehicle occupant.
[0058] In accordance with another further aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a

Brief Description of the Drawings
[0065] A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of
example only, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which:
[0066] Figure 1 shows schematically a system for providing travel information to a vehicle
occupant, in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention;
[0067] Figure 2 shows schematically a system for providing travel information to a vehicle
occupant, in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention;
[0068] Figure 3 shows schematically a system for providing travel information to a vehicle
occupant, in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention; and
[0069] Figure 4 shows a mobile communication device, in the preferred form of a cigarette
lighter adaptor, for use in the system depicted in Figures 1 to 3.
Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments
[0070] Figure 1 shows a system 10 for providing travel information to a vehicle occupant, in
accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention.

                                                 21
[0071] The system 10 comprises an electronic device 12 and an in-vehicle radio receiver unit 14
as part of the vehicle audio system which are located in the same vehicle. The system further
comprises a remote server 16, which is arranged to communicate with the device 12 via a
wireless telecommunications network, such as a GSM network. The device 12 is further in
communication with a web portal or mobile app on a smartphone 20, which can communicate
with the remote server 16. The device 12 is configured for one-way radio transmission to the in
vehicle unit 14.
[0072] The device 12 comprises a power connector 122 for connecting to an in-vehicle power
source, such as a 12V DC power source as is commonly found in vehicles, e.g. a cigarette
lighter plug. In addition, the device 12 has a mobile telecommunications unit 124 for bi
directional communication with the remote server 16. The mobile telecommunications unit 124
comprises a GSM or GPRS modem, a SIM housing and an antenna. The device 12 further
comprises an FM RDS radio transmitter 126, which is used to broadcast information for receipt
by the vehicle audio system 14. The device 12 further optionally comprises a short-range
communication device 128, such as a Bluetooth device or a WiFi modem, which can be used to
pair the device 12 with another device, such as the mobile phone 20.
[0073] The in-vehicle radio receiver unit 14 is, in this example, a vehicle entertainment system
comprising an FM radio receiver 142 e.g. FM RDS receiver, speakers 144 and a visual display
146.
[0074] The remote server 16 comprises a traffic server 162 for processing data from a plurality
of sources to determine real-time traffic information for a road network. For example, the traffic
server 162 can fuse data from cellular floating phone data, GPS-based probe data, data from
local authorities and data from loop systems in the road network. The remote server 16 further
comprises a positioning engine 166 for continually determining the position and heading of the
vehicle (carrying the device 12 and the audio system 14) as it traverses the road network. The
remote server 16 further comprises a mobile telecommunications unit (not shown) for
communicating with the device 12 via the network. The remote server 16 further comprises a
database of user preferences 164 associated with one or more devices 12, and which can be
used, instead of default settings, in determining relevant traffic information for a device 12.

                                                   22
[0075] In use, the electronic device 12, which may preferably take the form of a cigarette lighter
adaptor (CLA), plugs into a power supply of a vehicle, such as the 12V DC supply commonly
found in most vehicles. Upon connection to the power supply the device 12 activates the
modem 124 which connects with the wireless telecommunications network using the SIM.
While connected to a power source the modem 124 remains connected to the network and it
communicates periodically with the network and/or is paged by the network. In particular, the
modem 124 utilises cell ID to determine an approximate position of the device 12, which is
passed to the positioning engine 166 of the remote server 16 via a text message in a USSD
communication layer. The positioning engine uses the device's periodic communication to
determine the accurate geographic location and heading of the vehicle on the road network.
Each device 12 is associated with a default area around, or ahead of, the vehicle in which it is
located. The default area is 5 km in this example, but the user is able to adjust this as a
preference or the area may be determined based on a prediction of the route to be travelled by
the vehicle carrying the device 12. A user is able to update the stored parameters, and select
preferences, by accessing the database 164 via the web portal on a smart phone 20 and/or
conveniently using a smartphone app. User preferences displayed by the smart phone 20 might
include name, voice, area of interest, road class, etc. The user's smartphone is able to pair with
the device 12 via the Bluetooth or WiFi device 128, for example.
[0076] Based on the position and heading of the device 12, and any associated preferences, such
as area size, type of road for which travel information is desired (e.g. functional road class
(FRC)), etc that are stored in the database 164, the traffic server 162 is used to determine
relevant travel and traffic events in the vicinity of the device. These travel and traffic events are
converted into a traffic message that is temporarily stored at the server 16. The server 16 pushes
the created traffic message to the device 12 via the network.
[0077] The traffic message in this embodiment is in the form of a text message that is
transmitted over the network to the modem 124 using the USSD protocol. The messages are
broadcast by the FM RDS transmitter 126 of the device 12 using the TP and/or TA RDS
channels, whereupon they are received by the radio receiver 142 of the audio system 14. Such
messages will interrupt the normal radio audio broadcast.

                                                  23
[0078] The messages may simply be displayed as text on the display screen 146 of the vehicle.
Alternatively, or in addition, if the device 12 has TTS software, the messages may be output as
spoken messages by the vehicle's speakers 144.
[0079] The device 12 can further comprise an input device, such as a push button 132, that can
be used to cause the device 12 to push the most recent message to the vehicle radio receiver 142
and/or to request the server 16 to push the latest notification to the device 12. As discussed
above, the server 14 keeps a record of the most recent notification for each device 12, which
notifications are given expiration periods. The device 12 collects the most recent notification.
When the notification expires and a push request is received from a device 12, a new
notification is built for the device.
[0080] The device 12 can also further comprise one or more sockets for external devices 130,
such as a USB connector, which allows for, for example, the charging of an external device,
such as a smartphone, tablet computer, etc, thereby maintaining the usual function of a CLA.
[0081] The device 12 may further comprise one or more inertial measurement units (IMUs) 134,
such as an accelerometer, a gyroscope, etc, and which can be used to determine when the
vehicle containing the device 12 is stationary for a predetermined period of time, e.g. is parked,
but is also powered. When such a determination is made, then the modem 124 can be
disconnected from the network such that it does not unnecessarily utilise bandwidth of the
network. Upon a determination that the vehicle begins moving, then the modem 124 can be
reconnected to the network.
[0082] Figure 2 shows a system 10' for providing travel information to a vehicle occupant, in
accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. Many components of the
system are the same as discussed above in relation to Figure 1, with the exception of the device
12' and the in-vehicle radio receiver unit, which in this case is a navigation device 15.
[0083] In this embodiment, the traffic messages received by the device 12' from the remote
server 16 are encoded as TMC messages or in an Alert-C format. These TMC messages are
broadcast by the FM RDS radio transmitter 126 of the device 12' and received by an RDS-TMC
radio receiver 152 associated with the navigation device 15. The RDS-TMC receiver 152 may
be integrated within the navigation device 15, or alternatively may be part of an external antenna

                                                 24
that is connectable to the navigation device 15. The received TMC messages are decoded by the
RDS-TMC receiver 152 and can then be used by the navigation device 15, for example, when
determining a route.
[0084] Figure 3 shows a system 10" for providing travel information to a vehicle occupant, in
accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. Many components of the system
are the same as discussed above in relation to Figures 1 and 2, with the exception of the device
12" and the remote server 16'.
[0085] In this embodiment, the remote server 16' is arranged to communicate with the device
12" via a wireless telecommunications, e.g. GSM or GPRS network in order to provide travel
information. However the remote server 16' does not need to have a positioning engine, as the
device 12" includes a GNSS, e.g. GPS, receiver 220 that can determine a geographic position of
the device 12" without relying on the remote server 16' to determine its position. The GPS
receiver 220 may be able to determine the position of the device 12" more accurately than using
a GPRS network connection. Furthermore, communication between the device 12" and the
remote server 16' may be limited to traffic messages rather than including position determining
information as well, which can reduce the mobile data load.
[0086] As before, the remote server 16' comprises a traffic server 262 to provide real-time travel
information and a database 264 of user preferences which can be used, instead of default
settings, to determine relevant travel information for the device 12". Although not shown, the
remote server 16' includes a mobile telecommunications transceiver arranged to communicate
with the device 12".
[0087] In the device 12", the GPS receiver 220 determines an accurate position of the device 12"
and passes this information to a mobile telecommunications network transceiver 224, such as a
GSM or GPRS modem, that is in communication with the remote server 16' via a mobile
telecommunications network (using a SIM card for subscription - not shown). The server 16'
can then provide travel information based on the device's determined position.
[0088] The GPS receiver 220 can determine not only the geographic position of the device 12"
but also its velocity and acceleration. The GPS receiver 220 can therefore determine when the
vehicle is stationary. When it is determined that the vehicle has remained stationary for a

                                                  25
predetermined period of time, then the device 12" may disconnect the modem 224 from the
mobile network so as to remove unnecessary burden on the network. When it is detected that
the vehicle is moving again, then the device 12' can reconnect the modem 224 to the mobile
network.
[0089] As before, the device 12" comprises a power connector 222 for connecting to an in
vehicle power source, such as the cigarette lighter socket and an FM RDS radio transmitter 226
which is used to broadcast travel information to the in-vehicle radio receiver unit 15'. In
addition, the device 12" may optionally include a further short-range communication device 228,
such as a Bluetooth transceiver or a WiFi modem, which can be used to pair the device 12" with
another communication device, such as a smart phone 20.
[0090] The in-vehicle radio receiver unit 15' is substantially the same as in the embodiment of
Figure 2, including an RDS-TMC receiver 252, speakers 254 and visual display 246. The in
vehicle radio receiver unit 15' may take the form of a car radio device or a navigation device.
[0091] During operation of the device 12", the GPS receiver 220 can continuously monitor the
position of the device 12", and also speed, acceleration, etc and continuously or periodically
transfer such information to the remote server 16'. The remote server 16' can then determine
relevant traffic and travel information based on the information received from the device 12"
and create traffic/travel messages e.g. TMC messages to be pushed back to the device 12" over
the mobile telecommunications network, for example every two minutes. The mobile
telecommunications network modem 224 receives the TMC messages, which are then broadcast
by the radio transmitter 226 to the navigation (other in-vehicle) device 15. This means that any
vehicle having a radio receiver unit 15' can take advantage of accurate and up-to-date
travel/traffic information such as the TomTom Traffic service.
[0092] Figure 4 shows a preferred form for the electronic device 12 (or 12', or 12"), which is
that of a cigarette lighter adaptor (CLA). The device 12 has a body portion 30 for housing the
mobile telecommunications unit 124, the radio transmitter 126 and the short-range
communication device 128, and any other components as desired, e.g. the IMU 134 or GPS
receiver 220. On the outside of the body 30 is a push button 132, and a pair of LEDs 35 which
are used to indicate the current status of the device. Resiliently mounted first contact 32 and
second contacts 34 are used to connect the device to a power source of the vehicle (not shown).

                                                 26
[0093] The system provides for a vehicle occupant to receive travel information with a
relatively inexpensive apparatus. The device 12, preferably but not essentially in the form of a
CLA, communicates with a remote server via an existing telecommunications network from
which it receives travel messages that are appropriate to its geographical location and heading.
The geographical position of the device 12 may be determined by an on-board GNSS, e.g. GPS,
receiver and/or by the positioning engine of a remote server. The device 12 then transmits the
received travel messages as a radio signal to be received by the vehicle's existing audio system
or a navigation device within the vehicle. This allows a vehicle without a navigation device to
receive up to date and accurate information on the traffic ahead of the vehicle, e.g. to enable the
driver to confirm traffic information on dynamic signage on the road. Furthermore, it allows
vehicles with an existing navigation device, such as an integrated device, to receive and use
traffic information from a third party source, which may be, and typically is, of a higher quality
and/or more recently updated than the traffic information currently available to the navigation
device.
[0094] It will be appreciated that whilst various aspects and embodiments of the present
invention have heretofore been described, the scope of the present invention is not limited to the
particular arrangements set out herein and instead extends to encompass all arrangements, and
modifications and alterations thereto.
[0095] For example, whilst embodiments described in the foregoing detailed description refer to
GPS, it should be noted that the electronic device may utilise any kind of position sensing
technology as an alternative to (or indeed in addition to) GPS. For example, the electronic
device may utilise other global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) such as the European
Galileo system, Russian GLONASS, or any other national, regional or international navigation
system. Equally, the electronic device is not limited to satellite-based systems but could readily
function using ground-based beacons or any other kind of system that enables the device to
determine its geographic location.
[0096] It will also be well understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art that whilst the
preferred embodiment may implement certain functionality by means of software, that
functionality could equally be implemented solely in hardware (for example by means of one or
more SICs (application specific integrated circuit)) or indeed by a mix of hardware and
software.

[0097] Lastly, it should be noted that whilst the accompanying claims set out particular
combinations of features described herein, the scope of the present invention is not limited to the
particular combinations hereafter claims, but instead extends to encompass any combination of
features or embodiments herein disclosed irrespective of whether or not that particular
combination has been specifically enumerated in the accompanying claims at this time.
