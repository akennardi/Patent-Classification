      SYSTEM FOR MAINTAINING THE HEALTH OF ONE OR MORE PLANTS
Technical Field
[1]         The present invention relates to a system for maintaining the health of one
or more plants.
Background of Invention
[2]         A difficulty with planting and maintaining plants on a large scale is the
watering of individual plants, the different requirements for different plant types and
the changing weather conditions in which the plants are growing.             Labour costs
associated with manually inspecting each plant and watering each plant are very high.
Irrigation systems, while reducing labour costs, are generally large in scale and cost
and are not appropriate for some situations (e.g. urban settings and non-contiguous
rural plantings). Irrigation systems also use large amounts of water and are generally
inefficient. In addition, failure rates and replacement costs are high for planted trees.
[3]         It would therefore be desirable to provide a system and method which
alleviates or at least ameliorates one or more of the above problems.
[4]         The discussion of the background to the invention included herein including
reference to documents, acts, materials, devices, articles and the like is included to
explain the context of the present invention. This is not to be taken as an admission
or a suggestion that any of the material referred to was published, known or part of
the common general knowledge in Australia or in any other country as at the priority
date of any of the claims.
Summary of Invention
[5]         According to a first aspect, the present invention provides, a system for
maintaining and monitoring the health of one or more plants including: one or more
bladders adapted to contain a fluid, the bladder including an inlet for receiving a fluid
and one or more outlets for discharging the fluid and watering the one or more plants;
one or more fluid level sensors to determine the level of fluid in the bladder, one or
more environmental sensors; a control unit in communication with the outlet for

                                            2
control of the outlet and in communication with the sensors for receiving, storing and
transmitting data from the sensors.
[6]         Advantageously, and because of the monitoring capabilities, the present
invention allows for water efficiencies since only the required amount of water is
provided to the plant based on the sensor information. The invention thus allows for
the achievement of the traditional scale benefits of irrigation (i.e. labour efficiencies
and central control), but without the costly and often impractical limitations of laying
interconnecting pipe between the trees - and with the added benefit of having
bespoke control over each individual tree dependant on species type and specific site
requirements.
[7]         Preferably, the control unit permits or denies delivery of fluid to the plant
via the outlet based on data received from the environmental sensors.
[8]         The system preferably includes a remote server and database in electronic
communication with the control unit on the one or more plants.              The database
preferably includes plant data relating to the one or more plants, for data
interpretation and decision making to allow for correct watering actions.
[9]         The plant data may include, for example: one or more of species of plant,
soil type, soil compaction, geographic location of plant, rainfall records, weather
forecast data.
[10]        In a preferred embodiment, the system may utilize a combination of plant
data retrieved from the database and data received from the environmental sensors
and the control unit permits or denies delivery of fluid to the plant via the outlet. In an
alternative the environmental sensors may instead take the form of an LED which
prevents algal growth.
[11]        Advantageously, the present invention provides the operator the benefits of
irrigation (scale, labour efficiencies and central control) but with the additional ability
to provide watering (and potentially other monitored services) on an individually
tailored basis based on a number of criteria (for example, tree type, soil type, soil
compaction and localised environmental factors or the like).       The present invention
enables the owners (or guardians) of vast and diverse urban forests to achieve

                                              3
significant cost savings through labour and maintenance efficiencies, reduced tree
loss & replacement costs, as well as providing a user-friendly platform for the
collection of valuable data for both present and future urban forest planning.
[12]         It will be appreciated that the one or more bladders provided may extend
substantially around the circumference of the one or more plants or may be along one
or more sides of the plant. It may be one or multiple bladders or it may be a stacked
configuration, allowing for extensibility or modularity. The bladder may act as a guard
or a separate guard may be provided which extends around the circumference of the
bladder, with the bladder positioned between the guard and the plant. The one or
more bladders themselves may constitute the guard.
[13]         Preferably, the environmental sensors include, but are not limited to, one or
more of a soil moisture sensor, an air and water temperature sensor, a soil pH
sensor, a light sensor, humidity sensor or a camera.
[14]         Preferably,   the   control  unit determines     if the  sensors   exceed    a
predetermined threshold. Advantageously, the user associated with the system may
then be alerted so that the fluid in the bladder may be replenished. Preferably, three
fluid level sensors are provided so as to provide feedback when a water level is high,
medium and low. For example low, critical and empty. It will be appreciated that one
water level sensor may be used instead.         It will be appreciated that the water level
sensor may take any form including, for example, a pressure transducer.                The
pressure transducer may measure the water level and tell the system to shut off the
transducer when there is enough water. Also provided may be an analogue water
level sensor (without a pump).
[15]         Preferably, predetermined plant type data is stored in a database. It may
also be stored in the control unit. The predetermined threshold may be dependent on
plant type and soil conditions. Advantageously, the present invention allows for mass
watering of plants based on plant type and sensor data thereby avoiding the need for
manual watering of plants.

Detailed Description
[22]        Embodiments of the present invention can be realised over a network 115,
an example of which is shown in Figure 1A and 1B.
[23]        The system 100 of the present invention may run over a network 115 which
includes one or more watering devices 130A, 130B, 130C to 130n the operation of
which may be controlled via one or more electronic devices 105, 110 and/or one or
more server processing systems 120 which may be connected to a database 125. In
this example, the electronic devices include one or more mobile communication
devices 105 and one or more personal computers (PCs) 110. The server processing
system includes an internet based server 120 connected to a database 125. The
electronic device 105, personal computer 110 and server 120 are connected via a
network 115 such as the internet or a mobile communications network.
[24]        The watering devices 130A, 130B, 130C to 130n will be described further
in Figure 3, but include a guard 310 which is provided around the circumference of
the plant 305 and a bladder system 315 which is positioned between the guard 310
and the plant 305.       The bladder 315 also includes fluid level sensor 330A, 330B
(although any number of sensors may be provided) for advising of the fluid level in the
bladder 315 via a control unit 340. Also provided are environmental sensors 335A and
335B (although any number of sensors may be provided) which are in communication

                                             5
with the control unit 340 which provide information regarding the environmental
conditions in which the plant 305 in placed.
[25]        The transfer of information and/or data over the network can be achieved
using wired communications means or wireless communications means. It will be
appreciated that embodiments of the invention may be realised over different
networks, such as a MAN (metropolitan area network), WAN (wide area network) or
LAN (local area network). Also, embodiments need not take place over a network,
and the method steps could occur entirely on a client or server processing system.
[26]        The mobile communication device 105, personal computer 110, server
120, and control unit 340 may include a processing system 200 shown in Figure 2.
[27]         Figure 1B is a schematic diagram illustration a further example network
that can be utilised to give effect to the system, according to an embodiment of the
invention.
[28]         In particular, the system 100 of the present invention may run over a
network 115. This includes one or more watering devices 130A to 1301, which are
located at a particular geographic location.       For example, one or more watering
devices 130J to 130U which may be at another geographic location.
[29]         Figure 1B is intended to illustrate how the one or more watering devices
may communicate with each other via a concentrator 140, 150 to communicate via
the internet 115 to server 120 (not shown).
[30]         It will be appreciated that some of the one or more watering devices 130A
to 130U will be distributed at different locations. Some of the locations may include
hills or valleys and maybe remote and out of range of 3G and 4G mobile telephone
networks. Therefore the control unit 340 at a particular device, may not be able to
communicate directly via the internet 115. Instead a star arrangement may be
provided where, for example devices 130A to 1301 communicate data from
environmental sensors to the concentrator 140 which then relays the data to a
network 115. Alternatively at another geographic location, the devices 130J to 130U
may communicate with each other and forward data from particular devices to

                                            6
another device for ultimately forwarding to a concentrator 150 and this then forwards
data to the network 115.
[31]         For example, device 130N may provide data to 1300, device 1300 may
receive data from device 130M and 130N and forward that data to device 130R;
device 130R may receive data from devices 130P, 130Q 130S and ultimately forward
data from 130M, 130N, 1300, 130P, 1300 and 130S to concentrate a 150 and so on.
[32]        Advantageously, this arrangement is cost effective and permits operation in
situations where there is reduced access to data transfer or 3G networks and the like,
or where there is no line of sight between a device and the concentrators 140, 150.
[33]         Essentially, the arrangement shown in Figure 1B provides for different
communication configurations for different circumstances, namely where is limited
availability of a wireless or 3G connection or due to issues of topography namely line
of sight.
[34]        The communication between the devices 130A to 130U may be via WiFi,
Zigbee, LoRa or via 3G or 4G. Concentrators 140 and 150 may be a WiFi router with
an internet connection, Zigbee router an internet connection or a gateway and sim
card internet connection in the case of 3G and 4G communications.
[35]        An example processing system 200 which may be found in the control unit
340, devices 105, 110 and server 120 of Figure 1, for example, includes a processor
202 (or processing unit), a memory 204, at least one input device 206, at least one
output device 208 and a communications port 222. As is shown, the processor 202,
memory 204, input device 206, output device 208 and communications port 222 are
typically coupled together via a bus or group of buses 210. In certain embodiments,
input device 206 and output device 208 may be the same device such as in the case
of, for example, a computer graphics display or handheld device such as a tablet or
mobile    communication      device that  incorporates   a touch-screen   such as     a
smartphone.
[36]        An interface 212 can also be provided for coupling the processing system
200 to one or more peripheral devices. For example interface 212 may include a PCI

                                           7
card or PC card. At least one storage device 214 which houses at least one database
216 can also be provided.
[37]        The memory 204 may include any suitable memory device and including,
for example, volatile or non-volatile memory, solid state storage devices, magnetic
devices, etc. The memory 204 may typically store an operating system that provides
functionality to the processing system 200. A file system and files are also typically
stored on the storage device 214 and/or the memory 204. The memory 204 may also
include one or more software applications or program data.
[38]        The applications running in memory 104 may include a web browser /
interface or suitable application for displaying electronic documents for reading or
reviewing and accessing the internet 115 to carry out the method and system of the
present invention.
[39]        The processor 202 may include more than one processing device, for
example to handle different functions within the processing system 200. Input device
206 receives input data 218 and may include, for example, a keyboard, a pointer
device such as a pen-like device or a mouse, a touch-screen, audio receiving device
for voice controlled activation, such as a microphone, data receiver or antenna such
as a modem or wireless data adaptor, data acquisition card, etc. The input device 208
may be operable by a user to enter input data 218, or it may receive data from
another input data source. Thus, the input data 218 may be provided by different input
devices 206. For example, in an embodiment the input data 218 may include
keyboard or mouse instructions entered by a user, in conjunction with data received
via a network. Preferably, the input device 206 includes a touch screen associated
with an electronic communication device.
[40]        Output device 208 produces or generates output data 220. In one
embodiment, the output device 208 includes a display device (such as a computer
graphics display) for providing output data 220 in a visual form. In another
embodiment, the output device 208 includes a display device or monitor together with
a set of audio speakers in which case the output data 220 may be provided in an
audio-visual form.

                                             8
[41]       It will be appreciated that other types of output devices 208 may also be
used, such as, a port (for example a USB port), a peripheral component adaptor, a
data transmitter or antenna such as a modem or wireless network adaptor, etc.
[42]       It will also be appreciated that the output data 220 could be output from a
variety of different output devices 208 such as, for example, a visual display on a
monitor in conjunction with data transmitted across a network. In such an embodiment
a user may view data output, or an interpretation of the data output, on, for example,
a monitor or using a printer.
[43]       The storage device 214 can include any form of data or information storage
means, for example, volatile or non-volatile memory, solid state storage devices,
magnetic devices, etc.
[44]       The communications port 222 allows the processing system 200 to
communicate with other devices via a hard wired or wireless network, such as
network 115, which may include the Internet in Figure 1.
[45]       In use, the processing system 200 can be adapted to allow data or
information to be stored in and/or retrieved from, via wired or wireless communication
means, the database 216. The interface 212 may allow wired and/or wireless
communication between the processing unit 202 and peripheral components that may
serve a specialized purpose. The processor 202 may receive instructions as input
data 218 via input device 206 and can display processed results or other output to a
user by utilising output device 208. Multiple input devices 206 and/or output devices
208 can be provided.
[46]       It should be appreciated that the processing system 200 may be any form
of terminal, server processing system, specialised hardware, computer, computer
system or computerised device, personal computer (PC), mobile or cellular telephone,
mobile data terminal, portable computer, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), pager or
any other similar type of device.
[47]       Figure 3 is a perspective schematic view of the system for maintaining the
health of one or more plants according to the present invention. The system includes
a watering device 130A which surrounds one or more plants 305 and includes a

                                            9
guard 310 which is provided around the circumference of the plant 305. Also provided
are one or more bladders 315 which are positioned between the guard 310 and the
plant 305 and the bladder 315 contains a liquid such as water for watering the plant
305. The bladder 315 may extend along a substantial portion of the guard 310 or the
circumference of the guard 310 or may, as is shown in Figure 3, extend along one
side of one part of the guard as required. The bladder 315 may be made from any
suitable material such as plastic, steel, timber, aluminium or iron oxide plating. The
bladder also includes an inlet 320 for receiving fluid for storage in the bladder 315 and
one of more outlets 325 for discharging the fluid in the bladder 315 to water the plant
305. The bladder 315 also includes a fluid level sensor 330A and fluid level sensor
330B for advising of the fluid level in the bladder 315 via control unit 340. It will be
appreciated that one or more sensors may be used. For example, three sensors may
be used to provide a high, medium and low sensor level or a low, very low or critical
sensor level.    Fluid level sensors 330A and 330B are in communication with the
control unit 340 via suitable means such as wireless connection or WIFI connection. It
will be appreciated that one fluid level sensor 330A may be provided, rather than two
or more than two fluid level sensors may be provided. It will be appreciated that four
separate bladders (or multiple bladders in a modular configuration) 315 could be
provided which have their own sensors, inlets and outlets. Also provided are one or
more environmental sensors 335A and 335B which are in communication with the
control unit 340 to provide information regarding the environmental conditions in
which the plant 305 is placed. The environmental sensors may include one or more of
a soil moisture sensor, a temperature sensor, a soil pH sensor or a light sensor or an
air temperature or humidity sensor. A camera [not shown] may be provided which
allows remote viewing of the plant for remotely determining if a plant needs to be
pruned. For example, if an animal has been near the plant or to generally check on
the status of the plant remotely. This may be used in conjunction with a movement
sensor; for example.
[48]        Outlet 325 preferably includes a perforated hose 345 (e.g. Ag Pipe or other
suitable dripper pipe) which extends from the outlet 325 into the root system of the
plant 305 to provide water directly. Sensors may be provided (or integrated) within the
pipe / hose 345 where permissible so as to protect the sensors from the elements.
Also provided is a mat 350 which may act as mulch mat.

                                            10
[49]        In operation, the system includes one or more watering devices 130A
which are provided for each plant in a particular environment.      This may include a
farm or a city which has perhaps hundreds of trees within a particular region all of
which include a watering device 130A for each plant 305. Periodically, the control unit
340 via the sensor 330A and/or 330B determines whether or not there is sufficient
water in the bladder 325 and may report this via network 115, as shown in Figure 1, to
a server 120 and/or directly to database 125. A user via terminal 110 or mobile
communication device 105 may then retrieve this information via the network 115 and
via the server 120 and database 125 and thereby be informed as to the fluid level in
the one or more plants 305. A status check / feature may also be provided so that a
user of the system and method of the present invention can, at a glance see the
status of a large number of plants under their care (or be notified of critical issues
requiring attention).
[50]        The user associated with mobile device 105 of terminal 110 may then
make a decision as to sending in a maintenance crew or farmer out to top up the fluid
level of one or more of the systems 130A, or address any other service requirement.
In addition, the environmental sensors 335A and 335B preferably also provide
information to the control unit 340 regarding the environment in which the plant 305 is
currently in and whether or not it is an appropriate time to water the plant or not.
Watering may then be carried out automatically by the system. It will be appreciated
that a user associated with the system, may override and elect to water or not water a
particular plant if they wish. This information is relayed to control unit 340 which in
turn relays the information via network 115 to server 120 and database 125 at which
time the user associated with mobile device 105 or terminal 110 may elect to remotely
water the plant by sending a communication via the network 115 to the control unit
340 to discharge water via outlet 325 on a particular watering device 130A to plant
305. This may be done together or on an individual plant by plant basis. In operation,
hundreds or thousands of plants may be controlled by the system and method of the
present invention.      Advantageously, a large number of plants can be grown,
protected, watered and monitored without much supervision or maintenance. This
may be for example, in an orchard on a farm or in a metropolitan area such as a
council. The system via the database 125 may determine the types of plants and
water accordingly, taking into consideration species, soil type, soil compaction rates

                                               11
and upcoming weather events.           Advantageously, the system and method of the
present invention provides large scale, set-and-forget capability for the active
monitoring, watering, data recording and feedback required for growing plants
effectively & efficiently, with a user-friendly interface.
[51]        Database 125 in server 120 may also include a table of plant identifiers
associated with each of the systems 130A. That is to say that a particular plant type is
allocated to each of the systems 130A.            For example, if one plant is a Eucalypt
whereas another is of the genus Quercus (Oak) then an appropriate recommendation
may be made from the table based on the one or more environmental sensors 335A
and 335B. For example, if a particular species of plant is known to be associated with
a particular watering device 130A and there is particular amount of moisture in the soil
as determined by environmental sensor 335A then an appropriate amount of water
may or may not be supplied for that particular plant 305. This has the advantage of
essentially tailoring the fluid supply to a particular plant based on the type of plant and
on the sensor 335A or 335B.
[52]        Table 1 is an example of data that may be provided in a database 125
which may impact on the decision to water the plant - it will be appreciated that any
number of different types of data relating to the plant may be provided.

[53]       Table 2 is a further example of plant data stored by the database which
may impact the decision to water the plants and to what extent. It will be appreciated
that any number of different types of data relating to the plant may be provided.
               Soil Compaction                         Watering Factor
               Light                                   0.95

[54]       Advantageously, the remote server 120 and database 125 in electronic
communication with the control unit 340 on the one or more plants permits, via the
plant data interpretation and decision making allowing for correct watering actions.
[55]       As noted above, the plant data may include, for example: one or more of
species of plant, soil type, soil compaction, geographic location of plant, rainfall
records, and weather forecast data.
[56]       In a preferred embodiment, the system may utilize a combination of plant
data retrieved from the database and data received from the environmental sensors,
the control unit 340 permits or denies delivery of fluid to the plant via the outlet.
[57]       The guard 310 preferably includes four sides one of which may be on a
hinge for access to the plant which acts as a gate which may be locked for example.
Preferably the guard 310 is open at one or more of the sides to enable airflow but at
the same time narrow enough to prevent vermin and/or animals gaining access to the
plant 305. Preferably the height of the guard is between 1.4 and 1.5 meters tall and
the width of the guard is between 0.9 and 1 meter wide to enable the plants enough
room to gather light and grow. The guards and bladders may also take a modular

                                           13
form so that one guard and bladder may be placed on top of each other to a desired
height. The bladders being interconnectable for example. The guard is preferably
made of plastic and or steel so as to be resistant to bumps for example by live stock
or cars in the case of an urban setting. Preferably guard 310 and bladder 315 are
made of durably resistant materials.
[58]         The mat 350 is preferably a biodegradable mulch mat which prevents /
inhibits weeds from growing around it, such as coir.
[59]         In one embodiment, the bladder is provided within the circumference of the
guard 310 so as to allow for various configurations and modularity of bladders (by
placing one bladder on top of another). In another embodiment, the water bladder is
provided on three sides of the guard 310 so as to provide enough of a water reservoir
so that the bladders 315 need not be refilled. It is envisaged that the bladder and
guard would be provided for the duration of the establishment of the plant - which may
be up to 2 to 3 years depending on the type of plant and conditions.
[60]         Preferably the water bladder 315 is provided on four sides of the guard
310 and holds at least 200 litres of water. The bladder may be between 1.4 metres
high, 90 centimetres wide and five centimetres deep giving it approximately 63 litres
of capacity per side. Preferably, the bladder 315 includes slits within it to allow for
airflow through the bladder and the guard 310 to avoid excessive moisture build-up
and rotting of the plant 305 to occur. This will also prevent the device from blowing
away in a gale.
[61]         Figure 4 is a schematic diagram along the line AA of Figure 3 which
illustrates the watering device 130A which more clearly shows the bladder 315, guard
310, inlet 320, fluid level sensors 330A and 330B. As can be seen, the fluid level
sensor 330A is at a higher level than 330B such that an alert may be provided initially
when the fluid level is below the sensor 330A which acts as a predetermined level at
which point the user associated with device 105 or 110 may be alerted to the fluid
level via the control unit 340 and a further fluid level sensor 330B at a critical
predetermined level (that is to say almost when the bladder is empty) to advise the
user associated with device 105 or 110 to top up the bladder 315.

                                              14
[62]         Figure 5 is a flow diagram 500 of an embodiment of the invention in which
one or more plants are monitored and a data dump 505 is conducted on a periodic
basis which may be, for example, every eight hours. The one or more sensors
associated with the system determine at step 510 whether there is a soil moisture
deficit for each plant. The system will determine the particular plant associated with a
particular guard and bladder arrangement. For example, determining this information
from database 125 of Figure 1 and whether or not that amount of soil moisture is
adequate for that particular plant type. In the event that there is no deficit, control
moves to step 515 where no action is taken and control returns to step 505 once eight
hours or a predetermined time period has expired.
[63]         Otherwise if there is a soil moisture deficit control moves to step 520 where
another sensor determines whether the air temperature is between a particular pre
determined threshold. In this example it is determined whether or not the air
temperature is between 5 degrees and 30 degrees Celsius. The range and threshold
may be determined via the type of plant for example. In the event that the air
temperature is between 5 degrees and 30 degrees Celsius the control moves to step
525 where no action is taken and control may return to step 505 after a pre
determined time period in which the method is repeated.
[64]         Otherwise control moves to step 530 where a further determination is
made as to the water temperature via a sensor and in this particular case whether the
water temperature is between 3 degrees and 28 degrees Celsius. Importantly the
present invention determines the temperature of the water in the bladder so as not to
water a plant if the temperature of the water in the bladder is too high. In the event
that the water temperature is between 3 degrees and 28 degrees no action is taken at
step 535 otherwise control moves to step 540 where it is determined via the
communications network whether or not there is more than a predetermined amount
of rain expected in the next predetermined amount of time. In this case it is whether or
not there is 10 millimetres of rain expected in the next 12 hours. In the event that
there is control moves to step 545 where no action is taken for a pre-determined time
period. In this case 18 hours, otherwise control moves to step 550 in which the
bladder releases a pre-determined amount of water multiplied by a particular soil type
and/or compaction factors of the soil which are all stored in the database 125. In this
case 1 litre of water is provided based on the soil type and compaction factor.

                                         15
Advantageously it will be appreciated that this method is automated over a large
number of trees so that a user associated with the system need not concern
themselves with the watering or monitoring of a large number of plants.
