                                             ABSTRACT
                A gaming machine comprises a display and a game
   controller arranged to control images of symbols displayed
 5 on the display. The game controller is arranged to play a
   game wherein at least one                  random event is caused to be
   displayed on the display and, if a predefined winning
   event occurs, a prize is awarded. A plurality of sub-games
   constitute the game displayed on the display. As an
10 initial display, fewer than a full                  set of images of each
   of the sub-games                  are displayed to show a partial outcome
   of the game, the fewer than the                  full set of images being
   representative of a determination of an expected value for
   each of the sub-games.

                This invention relates to a gaming machine. More
 5 particularly, the invention relates to a gaming machine
   and to an improvement to a game played on such a gaming
   machine.
   Background of the invention
10              Players who regularly play gaming machines quickly
   tire of particular games and therefore it is necessary for
   manufacturers of these machines to develop innovative game
   features which add interest to the games. In so doing, it
   is hoped to keep players amused and therefore willing to
15 continue playing the game as well as to attract new
   players.
                Also, with growth that has occurred in the gaming
   machine market, there is intense competition between
20 manufacturers to supply various existing and new venues.
   When selecting a supplier of gaming machines, the operator
   of a venue will often pay close attention to the
   popularity of various games with their patrons. Therefore,
   gaming machine manufacturers are keen to devise games
25 and/or game features which are popular with the players as
   a mechanism for improving sales, retaining customers and
   attracting new customers.

20
                The invention is intended particularly for gaming
   machines displaying reel-type games, commonly referred to
   in Australia as poker machines and, in the USA, as slot
   machines. It will, however, be appreciated that the game
25 of the gaming machine could encompass any other type of
   wagering game such as,            for example, a ball-type game (such
   as keno, pachinko, bingo, or the like).
                For ease of explanation, the invention will be
30 described with reference to its application to reel-type
   wagering games. The reel-type game may be implemented as a
   video simulation of spinning reels.
                Each sub-game may have a plurality of image carrying
35 elements, each of which carries a plurality of images
   required to be considered in assessing an outcome of the
   game. The image carrying elements may, for example, be
   10390662_1 (GHMatters)P88210.AU.4

                                                      4
   five         spinning reels. In this regard, it               is to be
   understood that an image, as referred to above,                        is the set
   of three visible symbols of a reel strip which is
   displayed at                      any one time as is done conventionally for
 5 reel-type games.
                In the initial display of each               sub-game, fewer than
   all of the image carrying elements of the                       sub-games may be
   displayed to display the partial outcomes of the sub
10 games.
                In the case where the               sub-game comprises five reels,
   for the first                      sub-game the  reel stopping positions of
   reels          1,       3 and 5 may be determined initially to provide
15 the partial outcome                      for the  first sub-game. The reel
   stopping positions may be determined in a conventional
   manner such as by the use of a random number generator
    (RNG) of the game controller means.
20              Once the              reel stopping positions of reels 1,   3 and 5
   of the first                      sub-game have been determined, the   expected
   value          for those reel-stopping positions of the first               sub
   game may be determined. Thus, the expected value of the
   first          sub-game as derived from the displayed partial
25 outcome of the                      first sub-game may be used to select the
   displayed fewer than all of the                       image carrying elements of
   the        remaining sub-games in the initial display.
                The game              controller may include a data storage
30 element in which data relating to expected values                        for each
   of the remaining sub-games are                       stored. The data storage
   element may contain data for the expected values of each
   possible reel-stopping position of each of the remaining
   sub-games.                   The data may be stored in the     form of look-up
35 tables            for each of the           sub-games.
   10390662_1 (GHMatters)P88210.AU.4

                                        5
                Once the expected value for the first sub-game has
   been determined, the game controller may access the look
   up tables for each of the remaining sub-games to ascertain
   the expected value for each of the remaining sub-games
 5 which most closely approximates the expected value for the
   first sub-game. It will be appreciated that, in many
   instances, the expected value for any one of the remaining
   sub-games may not be exactly the same as that for the
   first sub-game. In such a case, the expected value most
10 closely approximating that of the first sub-game may be
   selected for the remaining sub game by the game
   controller.
                Once the expected values of the remaining sub-games
15 have been selected by the game controller, the reel
   stopping positions for reels 1, 3 and 5 of the remaining
   sub-games corresponding to the selected expected values,
   may be determined.
20              After the reel-stopping positions for each of the
   remaining sub-games has been determined by the game
   controller, reels 1, 3 and 5 of each of the sub-games may
   then be displayed on the display of the gaming machine.
25              The positions at which the second and fourth reels of
   each sub-game are displayed may be left blank.
                Prior to any of the sub-games being displayed a
   player may be required to place a wager. Initially, the
30 wager may be placed on all of the sub-games of the game.
   When the first, third and fifth reel of each of the sub
   games have been displayed, the player may, at the player's
   option, decide to leave the wager on each of the sub-games
   or, instead, transfer the total wager to one or less than
35 all of the sub-games with the non-selected sub-game/s then
   being disabled, for example, by being faded into a
   background display on the display means.
   10390662_1 (GHMatters)P88210.AU.4

                                        6
                If all of the sub-games are selected by the player,
   each sub-game may have its second and fourth reels
   revealed in a spinning condition which stop to determine
   whether or not a prize winning combination or combinations
 5 has resulted in any of the sub-games. Conversely, if only
   one or less than all of the sub-games is selected by the
   player, only the second and fourth reels of the selected
   games may be revealed and any prize winning combinations
   in the selected sub-games is paid out.
10
                Each selected sub-game may have a feature game
   associated with it and, if that feature is won, the
   feature is also played before the game is concluded. The
   feature associated with each sub-game may be a no-cost
15 feature. In other words, the player does not have to wager
   any additional amount to be eligible to participate in the
   feature of that sub-game.
                The feature associated with each sub-game may be
20 triggered by the controller independently of the result of
   a base sub-game preceding the triggered feature. Thus the
   feature does not depend on expected values associated with
   the relevant sub-game. The features associated with the
   sub-games may differ from one another.
25              Therefore, as indicated above, each feature may have
   its own theme, etc.
                Further, the game may have a jackpot bonus feature
   associated with it. The bonus feature may be in the form
30 of a progressive jackpot feature.
                The progressive jackpot may be triggered in any of a
   number of ways. One form of trigger may be a wager-based
   trigger where, the more that is wagered on the game, the
35 higher the chances are of obtaining the progressive
    jackpot.

                                                    7
                The progressive             jackpot may comprise at least  two
    jackpot levels being a minor jackpot and a mega                     jackpot.
   When the bonus                     feature is triggered, an animation may be
   displayed which indicates to the player which level                      of
 5  jackpot the player will win.
                A "gaming apparatus" is to be understood to include
   apparatus that does not require the wagering of a stake in
   order to play the game and further includes apparatus
10 which is                connectable to a network.

   Detailed Description of the Drawings
                In Figure 1, reference numeral 10 generally
   designates an exemplary embodiment of a gaming machine.
   The machine 10 includes a console 12 having a display
 5 means in the form of a video display unit 14 on which a
   game 16 is played, in use. The video display unit 14 may
   be implemented as a cathode ray screen device, a liquid
   crystal display, a plasma screen, or the like. The game 16
   comprises a plurality of spinning reel sub-games 18. A
10 midtrim 20 of the machine 10 houses a keypad 22 for
   enabling a player to play the game 16.         The midtrim 20 also
   houses a credit input mechanism 24 including a coin input
   chute 24.1 and a bill collector 24.2.
15              The machine 10 includes a top box 26 on which artwork
   28 is carried. The artwork 28 includes paytables, details
   of bonus awards, etc. In addition, as will be described in
   greater detail below, the top box carries two displays 42
   and 44 for a progressive jackpot bonus feature.
20
                A coin tray 30 is mounted beneath the console 12 for
   cash payouts from the machine 10.
                Referring to Figure 2 of the drawings, a control
25 means or control circuit 32 is illustrated. A program
   which implements the game and user interface is run on a
   processor 34 of the control circuit 32. The processor 34
   forms part of a controller 36 that drives the screen of
   the video display unit 14 and that receives input signals
30 from sensors 38. The sensors 38 include sensors associated
   with the bank 22 of buttons and touch sensors mounted in
   the screen of the video display unit 14. The controller 36
   also receives input pulses from the mechanism 24 to
   determine whether or not a player has provided sufficient
35 credit to commence playing. The mechanism 24 may, instead
   of the coin input chute 24.1 or the bill collector 24.2,
   10390662_1 (GHMatters)P88210.AU.4

                                                    9
   or in addition thereto, be a credit card reader                      (not
   shown) or any other type of validation device.
                Finally, the controller 36 drives a payout mechanism
 5 40 which, for example, may be a coin hopper for feeding
   coins to the coin tray 30 to make a pay out to a player
   when the player wishes to redeem his or her credit.
                As indicated above, the game 16 comprises four sub
10 games 18. Each sub-game 18 is a spinning reel-game
   comprising five spinning reels. The reels are displayed as
   simulations of spinning reels on the display of the video
   display unit 14.
15              The preferred implementation of the game 16 comprises
   the use of four of the Applicant's popular games. Hence,
   the first sub-game 18.1                     (Figures 4-8) is the Applicant's
   Queen of the Nile@ game, the second sub-game 18.2 is the
   Applicant's Penguin Pays@ game, the third sub-game 18.3 is
20 the Applicant's Dolphin Treasure@ game and the fourth sub
   game is the Applicant's Sweethearts@ game                      ("Queen of the
   Nile",            "Penguin Pays", "Dolphin Treasure" and
   "Sweethearts" are all registered trademarks of the
   Applicant).
25
                The Queen of the Nile@ sub-game is a five-reel
   spinning reel game where three or more scattered Pyramid
   symbols 46                    (Figure 4) award a feature. The feature
   comprises fifteen free games where all prizes are trebled.
30 The free games can be retriggered during the feature.
                The Penguin Pays@ sub-game 18.2 comprises a feature
   where, when a Penguin symbol 48 appears on a first reel
   and a background-coin symbol 50 appears on the fifth reel,
35 a feature is awarded. During the feature a skating penguin
   symbol moves serially to all positions on the reels of the
   sub-game 18.2 and, at each position, except where a
   10390662_1 (GHMatters)P88210.AU.4

                                                      10
   scatter symbol appears,                       substitutes for the underlying
   symbol.
                The Dolphin Treasure@ sub-game 18.3 has a feature
 5 where, when three or more Treasure Chest scatter symbols
    (not shown) appears anywhere on the display fifteen free
   games are awarded where all prizes are trebled. Once
   again, the                    free game feature can be re-triggered during
   the playing of the                      free games.
10
                The        Sweethearts@ sub-game 18.4 has a        feature which is
   won with any scatter win. The initial scatter win is held
   and the remaining reels are                       re-spun three times. During
   the        re-spins,               scatters pay in an "any" combination. Any
15 improved scatter win is held and three free spins re
   commence. The                      scatter symbol is a heart symbol 52.
                In order to play the game 16, the player is               required
   to place a wager. The                      subgames 18.1-18.4 have been
20 implemented as twenty line games.                       In order to simplify the
   mathematics involved, the player must place a wager of at
   least one bet per line on all twenty lines                       of each of the
   sub-games                  18.1-18.4. Accordingly, as indicated by a bet
   meter 54                in Figures       4-6,  the player has to bet a minimum
25 stake of 80 credits.
                In this              regard, it is to be noted that  each sub-game
   18.1-18.4 has a win meter 56.1-56.4, respectively,
   associated with it.
30
                The player places the wager by pressing one of four
   buttons 58,                     60,  62 or 64 on the keypad 22.  Button 58 is
   pressed if one bet per line is to be wagered, button                       60  is
   pressed if two bets per line are to be wagered, button                        62
35 is pressed if three bets per line are to be wagered and
   button            64       is pressed if ten bets per line are to be
   wagered.

                                                       11
                The player then commences the game 16 by pressing
   button            66 on the keypad 22.
                As an initial               step, the controller 34 selects,
 5 randomly using a random number generator, reel                         stopping
   positions                  for the      first, third and fifth reel of the sub
   game 18.1.                      Once these    reel stopping positions have been
   determined, and before anything is displayed on the
   display of the video display unit 14,                        the controller 34
10 determines the expected value arising as a result of the
   selected reel stopping positions                        for reels  1, 3 and 5 of
   the        sub-game 18.1.
                The controller 34 has a data storage device in which
15 look-up tables                      for each of sub-games   18.2-18.4 are  stored.
   The look-up table for each of the sub-games                         18.2-18.4
   contains expected values for all possible reel                         stopping
   positions of each of the sub-games                        18.2-18.4.
20              Thus, once the expected value for the reel                 stopping
   positions of reels                       1,  3 and 5 of sub-game 18.1 has been
   determined by the                       controller 34,  the controller 34
   accesses the look-up tables for each of the remaining sub
   games          18.2-18.4.             The controller 34 determines expected
25 values for the remaining sub-games                        18.2-18.4 which are
   approximately the                       same as the determined expected value
   for the sub-game 18.1.                        It is not necessary that the
   expected values for the                        sub-games 18.2-18.4 be exactly the
   same as that                      for sub-game 18.1 but can be    slightly more or
30 slightly less than the expected value for                         sub-game 18.1.
                Once the expected values for the sub-games                 18.2-18.4
   have been ascertained via the look-up tables of the
   controller 34,                      the  controller 34  selects reel stopping
35 positions                  for reels      1,  3 and 5 for each of the remaining
   sub-games                  18.2-18.4.       It will be appreciated that the
   selected reel stopping positions                        for reels  1, 3 and 5
   10390662_1 (GHMatters)P88210.AU.4

                                                    12
   correspond to the ascertained expected values for the sub
   games 18.2-18.4.
                Once these reel-stopping positions have been selected
 5 by the controller 34, the reel stopping positions of reels
   1, 3 and 5 for each of the sub-games 18.1-18.4 are
   displayed on the display of the video display unit 14 as
   shown in Figures 4 and 7 of the drawings.
10              The player then has two options. The player can
   either elect to play all four sub-games 18.1-18.4 or any
   one of the sub-games 18.1-18.4. The options available to
   the player are displayed by way of a message 70                     (Figure 4)
   on the display.
15
                Should the player desire to play all four games, the
   player presses button 68                     (Figure 3) on the keypad 22. When
   the player presses button 68, the second and fourth reels
   for each of the sub-games 18.1-18.4 become visible and
20 spin. The second and fourth reels then come to a stop to
   show, for example, the result illustrated in Figure 5 of
   the drawings. A message 72 is displayed showing that the
   player had played all four games and had bet one bet or
   credit per line as shown by message 74.
25
                In the examples shown in Figure 5 of the drawings,
   the only win occurring was a prize of 600 credits as shown
   on win meter 56.2. However, because the trigger condition
   of symbols                    48 and 50 was present, the player is awarded
30 the feature associated with Penguin Pays@ and a total win
   of 10,040 credits results as shown on the win meter 76 of
   the gaming machine 10.
                Should the player rather desire to play only one of
35 the sub-games 18.1-18.4, the player presses an appropriate
   button 78,                    80, 82 or 84 associated with the sub-games
   18.1,          18.2, 18.3 and 18.4,            respectively.
   10390662_1 (GHMatters)P88210.AU.4

                                                   13
                In the example illustrated, it is assumed that the
   player has selected to play the Sweethearts@ sub-game
   18.4. The player does this by pressing button 84.
 5              The result of the player electing to play the
   Sweethearts@ game is shown in Figure 6 of the drawings. A
   message 86 appears advising the player that only the
   Sweethearts@ game is being played. Importantly, the
   credits which had initially been bet on the other sub
10 games 18.1-18.3 are transferred to the sub-game 18.4 so
   that, as shown by message 88 four credits or bets per line
   are wagered on the sub-game 18.4.
                The sub-games 18.1-18.3 fade into a background of the
15 display so that only sub-game 18.4 is visible. The second
   and fourth reels of the sub-game 18.4 appear, spin and
   then come to a stop. The result, as shown in Figure 6 of
   the drawings, is that three scatter symbols 52 are spun up
   in the sub-game 18.4 resulting in a payment of 100 credits
20 multiplied by the number of credits per line for a total
   of 400 credits. The win is credited to the win meter 56.4
   of the sub-game 18.4 and the win meter 76 of the gaming
   machine 10.                    The game is then regarded as concluded and the
   player, in order to continue playing the gaming machine 10
25 must place a further wager.
                The game 16 includes a progressive jackpot feature.
   The progressive jackpot bonus feature is a two tier
    jackpot game consisting of a mega jackpot, the present
30 value of which is displayed on the display 42 of the
   gaming machine 10, and a minor jackpot, the present value
   of which is displayed on the display 44 of the gaming
   machine 10.
35              The display 42 is a nine digit display and the
   display 44 is a five digit display.

                                                      14
                The progressive              jackpot feature can be won at random
   during any bought game. The                       chances of winning the   jackpot
   feature are related to the                       size of the bet wagered. The
   higher the bet wagered, the greater the likelihood of
 5 winning the                     jackpot  feature.
                When the             jackpot  feature is triggered, the    screen
   display on the video display unit 14 changes to a screen
   display 90                   as   shown in Figure 10 of the drawings.     The
10 screen display 90                     is in the   form of a circle   92 having a
   segment               94     representative of the mega      jackpot with the
   remaining part of the circle                        92 being representative of
   the minor jackpot.                      A marker  96 rolls around the   outside of
   the        circle             92 and where the marker 96 comes to rest
15 relative to the circle                      92 determines whether the minor
    jackpot is awarded or the mega jackpot                       is awarded. If the
   marker            96 comes to rest opposite the             segment  94 the mega
    jackpot is awarded. If the marker 96 comes                        to rest at any
   other positions relative to the                        circle 92,  the minor
20  jackpot is awarded.
                The jackpot             feature is awarded only once all wins and
   features associated with the sub-games                        18.1-18.4 have been
   completed. A message will                      appear on the display prior to
25 the        display changing to the                screen display 90 advising the
   player that, to commence with the                        jackpot  feature, the
   Spin button                     66 on the keypad 22 must be pressed. When this
   occurs, the screen display 90 replaces the                         display of the
   sub-games                  18.1-18.4.
