                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           Type II diabetes is the most common form of diabetes accounting for 90% of diabetes
   cases. Over 100 million people worldwide have type-2 diabetes (nearly 17 million in the U.S.)
   and the prevalence is increasing dramatically in both the developed and developing worlds.
20 Type-II diabetes is a lifelong illness, which generally starts in middle age or later part of life,
   but can start at any age. Patients with type-2 diabetes do not respond properly to insulin, the
   hormone that normally allows the body to convert blood glucose into energy or store it in cells
   to be used later. The problem in type-2 diabetes is a condition called insulin resistance where
   the body produces insulin, in normal or even high amounts, but certain mechanisms prevent
25 insulin from moving glucose into cells. Because the body does not use insulin properly,
   glucose rises to unsafe levels in the blood, the condition known as hyperglycemia.
           Over time, sustained hyperglycemia leads to glucotoxicity, which worsens insulin
   resistance and contributes to dysfunction in the beta cells of the pancreas. The degree of
   sustained hyperglycemia is directly related to diabetic microvascular complications and may
30 also contribute to macrovascular complications. In this way, hyperglycemia perpetuates a
   cycle of deleterious effects that exacerbate type 2 diabetes control and complications.

     WO 20111060256                                                          PCT/US2010/056529
   complications associated with elevated glucose in the blood. Oral therapeutic options for
   the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus include compounds known as: sulfonylureas,
   biguanides (metformin), thiazolidinediones, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. The active
   agents from each class are generally administered to patients alone. However, once
 5 monotherapy becomes inadequate, combination therapy is an attactive and rational course
   of action for treating hyperglycemia despite the known side effect of weight gain
   associated with sulfonylurea and thiazolidinone therapies.
           Recently, a new class of anti-diabetics was discovered known as sodium-glucose
   transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2). SGLT2 inhibitors prevent the reabsorption of glucose
10 into blood by the kidney. The kidney continuously filters glucose through the glomerulus
   into the bladder, however, nearly all of this glucose is reabsorbed. SGLT2 is the protein
   responsible for the majority of glucose reabsorption and helps the body retain glucose for
   its energy requirements. For patients with diabetes, retention of excess glucose by this
   pathway contributes to persistent hyperglycemia. Suppressing the activity of SGLT2
15 inhibits renal-glucose reabsorption in the body, thereby leading to the excretion of
   glucose in the urine.
           Accordingly, the present invention provides bilayer tablet formulations that
   consist of metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor for oral administration in the treatment of
   diseases or disorders associated with SGLT2 activity without weight gain associated with
20 other therapies. The first layer of the bilayer tablet is metformin extended release (XR)
   or metformin XR in a reduced mass formulation. The second layer is an SGLT2 inhibitor
   formulation. The metformin/SGLT2 bilayer tablet of the present invention provides an
   antidiabetic therapy to patients that is both convenient and effective for controlling blood
   glucose levels.

                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
           Preparing bilayer tablets with significantly different weight ratios between the two
   layers can lead to cracking at the layer interface, separation of the layers, or even cross
   contamination of the two layers. The large difference in weight ratio between the metformin
 5 and the SGLT2 inhibitor layers of Examples 4-15 provides challenges with regard to
   maintaining potency and content uniformity of the lower weight layer, the SGLT2 inhibitor
   layer. Furthermore it was found that a number of trial formulations showed cracking in the
   SGLT2 layers at the tablet surface in an area adjacent to but separate from the interface
   between the layers and parallel to that interface. Formulations of the SGLT2 layer with
10 increased microcrystalline cellulose levels, for example, reduced or eliminated cracking,
   separation, and cross-contamination of the two layers while maintaining potency and
   uniformity of the second layer. Further, pregelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose EXF,
   or mannitol, can be used as a substitute for a portion of the microcrystalline cellulose. Finally,
   a total weight of about 300 mgs to about 400 mgs for the second layer contributed to reducing
15 or eliminating cracking, separation, and
                                                    4a

   Human Studies
25         In a 24-week phase 3 clinical study, the combination of metformin and
   dapagliflozin, an SGL T2 inhibitor, reduced glycosylated hemoglobin levels (HbAI c) and
   fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels in type II diabetic patients. Glycosylated
   hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose levels were inadequately controlled with
   metformin alone, as compared to placebo plus metformin. The study also showed that
30 individuals receiving dapagliflozin had statistically greater mean reductions in body
   weight compared to individuals taking placebo.

            The study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin as an
   add-on to metformin over 24 weeks in patients with inadequately controlled type 2
   diabetes. The data represent findings from a randomized, double-blind, placebo
   controlled study of 546 individuals with type 2 diabetes whose HbA l c was greater than
 5 or equal to 7.0 percent and less than or equal to 10 percent at baseline. After a two-week
   lead-in phase, individuals were randomized to one of four separate treatment arms:
   dapagliflozin 2.5 mg (n= 137), dapagliflozin 5 mg (n= 137), dapagliflozin 10 mg (n=
   135), or placebo (n= 137). Patients in all arms also received metformin (greater than or
   equal to 1500 mg/d). The primary endpoint of the study compared mean HbAlc change
10 from baseline for each dapagliflozin treatment arm compared to placebo after 24 weeks.
   Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in FPG and body weight at week 24
   as compared to placebo, and adjusted percentage of individuals treated with dapagliflozin
   who achieved HbAlc of less than 7 percent at 24 weeks. Exploratory endpoints included
   body weight decrease of greater than or equal to 5 percent or greater than or equal to 10
15 percent as well as body weight percent change from baseline.
            After 24 weeks, individuals receiving dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg plus
   metformin demonstrated a statistically significant adjusted mean change in HbAlc from
   baseline of -0.67 percent, -0.70 percent and -0.84 percent, respectively, compared to
   -0.30 percent for placebo. Individuals treated with dapagliflozin demonstrated a
20 statistically significant adjusted mean change in FPG, a secondary endpoint, from
   baseline at Week 24: -17.8 mg/dL for dapagliflozin 2.5 mg -21.5 mg/dL for dapagliflozin
   5 mg and -23.5 mg/dL /dl for dapagliflozin 10 mg, compared to -6.0 mg/dL for placebo.
            The study also evaluated the potential impact of dapagliflozin on weight loss.
   These findings included data measuring changes in total body weight over the 24-week
25 study period. At 24 weeks, the change in total body weight in kg, a secondary endpoint,
   was -2.21 kg for dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, -3.04 kg for dapagliflozin 5 mg and -2.86 kg for
   dapagliflozin 10 mg, compared to -0.89 kg for placebo. Overall, more patients taking
   dapagliflozin achieved weight losses greater than or equal to 5 percent compared to
   placebo, an exploratory endpoint.

   formulation that is dapagliflozin (S) PGS granulation (2.5 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg strength) in
 5 the second hopper. The tablet press was set to obtain the target weight for the first layer
   (metformin XR or reduced mass metformin XR). The second hopper was opened and the
   tablet press was adjusted to obtain the target tablet weight of dapagliflozin and metformin
   XR or dapagliflozin and reduced mass metformin XR bilayer tablets. Once the target
   weight was obtained the press was adjusted to obtain the target hardness. Once the
10 hardness was obtained, the manufactured tablets were periodically monitored regarding
   the weight of the first layer, and the weight, hardness, gauge and friability of the whole
   tablet. The collect bilayer tablets were film coated with Opadry® II PVA (polyvinyl
   alcohol).
