                                  Field of the Disclosure
[0002]         This relates generally to electronic devices that are capable of recognizing
handwritten input provided to the devices.
                               Background of the Disclosure
[0003]         User interaction with devices such as computers and other electronic
computing devices has increased significantly in recent years. These devices can be
devices such as computers, tablet computers, televisions, multimedia devices, and the
like.
[0004]         Interaction with these devices can be performed using various input
devices, such as touch screen displays, touch-sensitive surfaces, remote controls, mice
and other input devices. Touch-sensitive surfaces and touch screen displays, in particular,
have become increasingly popular input devices, as has providing handwritten input using
such input devices. Providing for robust character recognition of handwritten input
enhances the user's experience with the device by reducing errors in character input and
decreases user interaction time, which is particularly important where input devices are
battery-operated.

                                     Detailed Description
[0020]           In the following description of embodiments, reference is made to the
accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which it is shown by way of
illustration specific embodiments that are optionally practiced. It is to be understood that
other embodiments are optionally used and structural changes are optionally made
without departing from the scope of the disclosed embodiments.
                                  EXEMPLARY DEVICES
[0021]           Embodiments of electronic devices, user interfaces for such devices, and
associated processes for using such devices are described. In some embodiments, the
device is a portable communications device, such as a mobile telephone, that also
contains other functions, such as PDA and/or music player functions. Exemplary
embodiments of portable multifunction devices include, without limitation, the iPhone@,
iPod Touch@, and iPad@ devices from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California. Other
portable electronic devices, such as laptops or tablet computers with touch-sensitive
surfaces (e.g., touch screen displays and/or touch pads), are, optionally, used. It should
also be understood that, in some embodiments, the device is not a portable
communications device, but is a desktop computer or a television with a touch-sensitive
surface (e.g., a touch screen display and/or a touch pad). In some embodiments, the
device does not have a touch screen display and/or a touch pad, but rather is capable of
outputting display information (such as the user interfaces of the disclosure) for display
on a separate display device, and capable of receiving input information from a separate
                                               -3-

WO 2015/200228                                                           PCT/US2015/037030
input device having one or more input mechanisms (such as one or more buttons, a touch
screen display and/or a touch pad). In some embodiments, the device has a display, but is
capable of receiving input information from a separate input device having one or more
input mechanisms (such as one or more buttons, a touch screen display and/or a touch
pad).
[0022]          In the discussion that follows, an electronic device that includes a display
and a touch-sensitive surface is described. It should be understood, however, that the
electronic device optionally includes one or more other physical user-interface devices,
such as a physical keyboard, a mouse and/or a joystick. Further, as described above, it
should be understood that the described electronic device, display and touch-sensitive
surface are optionally distributed amongst two or more devices. Therefore, as used in this
disclosure, information displayed on the electronic device or by the electronic device is
optionally used to describe information outputted by the electronic device for display on a
separate display device (touch-sensitive or not). Similarly, as used in this disclosure,
input received on the electronic device (e.g., touch input received on a touch-sensitive
surface of the electronic device) is optionally used to describe input received on a
separate input device, from which the electronic device receives input information.
[0023]          The device typically supports a variety of applications, such as one or
more of the following: a drawing application, a presentation application, a word
processing application, a website creation application, a disk authoring application, a
spreadsheet application, a gaming application, a telephone application, a video
conferencing application, an e-mail application, an instant messaging application, a
workout support application, a photo management application, a digital camera
application, a digital video camera application, a web browsing application, a digital
music player application, a television channel browsing application, and/or a digital video
player application.
[0024]          The various applications that are executed on the device optionally use at
least one common physical user-interface device, such as the touch-sensitive surface.
One or more functions of the touch-sensitive surface as well as corresponding information
displayed on the device are, optionally, adjusted and/or varied from one application to the
next and/or within a respective application. In this way, a common physical architecture
                                              -4-

(such as the touch-sensitive surface) of the device optionally supports the variety of
applications with user interfaces that are intuitive and transparent to the user.
[0025]           Attention is now directed toward embodiments of portable or non-portable
devices with touch-sensitive displays, though the devices need not include touch-sensitive
displays or displays in general, as described above. Fig. 1A is a block diagram
illustrating portable or non-portable multifunction device 100 with touch-sensitive
displays 112 in accordance with some embodiments. Touch-sensitive display 112 is
sometimes called a "touch screen" for convenience, and is sometimes known as or called
a touch-sensitive display system. Device 100 includes memory 102 (which optionally
includes one or more computer readable storage mediums), memory controller 122, one
or more processing units (CPU's) 120, peripherals interface 118, RF circuitry 108, audio
circuitry 110, speaker 111, microphone 113, input/output (1/0) subsystem 106, other
input or control devices 116, and external port 124. Device 100 optionally includes one
or more optical sensors 164. Device 100 optionally includes one or more intensity
sensors 165 for detecting intensity of contacts on device 100 (e.g., a touch-sensitive
surface such as touch-sensitive display system 112 of device 100). Device 100 optionally
includes one or more tactile output generators 167 for generating tactile outputs on device
100 (e.g., generating tactile outputs on a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive
display system 112 of device 100 or touchpad 355 of device 300). These components
optionally communicate over one or more communication buses or signal lines 103.
[0026]           As used in the specification and claims, the term "intensity" of a contact
on a touch-sensitive surface refers to the force or pressure (force per unit area) of a
contact (e.g., a finger contact) on the touch-sensitive surface, or to a substitute (proxy) for
the force or pressure of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface. The intensity of a
contact has a range of values that includes at least four distinct values and more typically
includes hundreds of distinct values (e.g., at least 256). Intensity of a contact is,
optionally, determined (or measured) using various approaches and various sensors or
combinations of sensors. For example, one or more force sensors underneath or adjacent
to the touch-sensitive surface are, optionally, used to measure force at various points on
the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations, force measurements from multiple
force sensors are combined (e.g., a weighted average) to determine an estimated force of
a contact. Similarly, a pressure-sensitive tip of a stylus is, optionally, used to determine a
                                               -5-

WO 2015/200228                                                             PCT/US2015/037030
pressure of the stylus on the touch-sensitive surface. Alternatively, the size of the contact
area detected on the touch-sensitive surface and/or changes thereto, the capacitance of the
touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto, and/or the
resistance of the touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto
are, optionally, used as a substitute for the force or pressure of the contact on the touch
sensitive surface. In some implementations, the substitute measurements for contact
force or pressure are used directly to determine whether an intensity threshold has been
exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is described in units corresponding to the substitute
measurements). In some implementations, the substitute measurements for contact force
or pressure are converted to an estimated force or pressure and the estimated force or
pressure is used to determine whether an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the
intensity threshold is a pressure threshold measured in units of pressure).
[0027]           As used in the specification and claims, the term "tactile output" refers to
physical displacement of a device relative to a previous position of the device, physical
displacement of a component (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) of a device relative to
another component (e.g., housing) of the device, or displacement of the component
relative to a center of mass of the device that will be detected by a user with the user's
sense of touch. For example, in situations where the device or the component of the
device is in contact with a surface of a user that is sensitive to touch (e.g., a finger, palm,
or other part of a user's hand), the tactile output generated by the physical displacement
will be interpreted by the user as a tactile sensation corresponding to a perceived change
in physical characteristics of the device or the component of the device. For example,
movement of a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch-sensitive display or trackpad) is,
optionally, interpreted by the user as a "down click" or "up click" of a physical actuator
button. In some cases, a user will feel a tactile sensation such as an "down click" or "up
click" even when there is no movement of a physical actuator button associated with the
touch-sensitive surface that is physically pressed (e.g., displaced) by the user's
movements. As another example, movement of the touch-sensitive surface is, optionally,
interpreted or sensed by the user as "roughness" of the touch-sensitive surface, even when
there is no change in smoothness of the touch-sensitive surface. While such
interpretations of touch by a user will be subject to the individualized sensory perceptions
of the user, there are many sensory perceptions of touch that are common to a large
                                               -6-

WO 2015/200228                                                           PCT/US2015/037030
majority of users. Thus, when a tactile output is described as corresponding to a
particular sensory perception of a user (e.g., an "up click," a "down click," "roughness"),
unless otherwise stated, the generated tactile output corresponds to physical displacement
of the device or a component thereof that will generate the described sensory perception
for a typical (or average) user.
[0028]          It should be appreciated that device 100 is only one example of a portable
or non-portable multifunction device, and that device 100 optionally has more or fewer
components than shown, optionally combines two or more components, or optionally has
a different configuration or arrangement of the components. The various components
shown in Fig. 1A are implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both
hardware and software, including one or more signal processing and/or application
specific integrated circuits. Further, the various components shown in Fig. 1A are
optionally implemented across two or more devices; for example, a display and audio
circuitry on a display device, a touch-sensitive surface on an input device, and remaining
components on device 100. In such an embodiment, device 100 optionally communicates
with the display device and/or the input device to facilitate operation of the system, as
described in the disclosure, and the various components described herein that relate to
display and/or input remain in device 100, or are optionally included in the display and/or
input device, as appropriate.
[0029]          Memory 102 optionally includes high-speed random access memory and
optionally also includes non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage
devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid-state memory devices. Access
to memory 102 by other components of device 100, such as CPU 120 and the peripherals
interface 118, is, optionally, controlled by memory controller 122.
[0030]          Peripherals interface 118 can be used to couple input and output
peripherals of the device to CPU 120 and memory 102. The one or more processors 120
run or execute various software programs and/or sets of instructions stored in memory
 102 to perform various functions for device 100 and to process data.
[0031]          In some embodiments, peripherals interface 118, CPU 120, and memory
controller 122 are, optionally, implemented on a single chip, such as chip 104. In some
other embodiments, they are, optionally, implemented on separate chips.

[0032]           RF (radio frequency) circuitry 108 receives and sends RF signals, also
called electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 converts electrical signals to/from
electromagnetic signals and communicates with communications networks and other
communications devices via the electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 optionally
includes well-known circuitry for performing these functions, including but not limited to
an antenna system, an RF transceiver, one or more amplifiers, a tuner, one or more
oscillators, a digital signal processor, a CODEC chipset, a subscriber identity module
(SIM) card, memory, and so forth. RF circuitry 108 optionally communicates with
networks, such as the Internet, also referred to as the World Wide Web (WWW), an
intranet and/or a wireless network, such as a cellular telephone network, a wireless local
area network (LAN) and/or a metropolitan area network (MAN), and other devices by
wireless communication. The wireless communication optionally uses any of a plurality
of communications standards, protocols and technologies, including but not limited to

[0033]           Audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, and microphone 113 provide an audio
interface between a user and device 100. Audio circuitry 110 receives audio data from
peripherals interface 118, converts the audio data to an electrical signal, and transmits the
electrical signal to speaker 111. Speaker 111 converts the electrical signal to human
audible sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 also receives electrical signals converted by
                                              -8-

microphone 113 from sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 converts the electrical signal to
audio data and transmits the audio data to peripherals interface 118 for processing. Audio
data is, optionally, retrieved from and/or transmitted to memory 102 and/or RF circuitry
 108 by peripherals interface 118. In some embodiments, audio circuitry 110 also includes
a headset jack (e.g., 212, Fig. 2). The headset jack provides an interface between audio
circuitry 110 and removable audio input/output peripherals, such as output-only
headphones or a headset with both output (e.g., a headphone for one or both ears) and
input (e.g., a microphone).
[0034]           1/0 subsystem 106 couples input/output peripherals on device 100, such as
touch screen 112 and other input control devices 116, to peripherals interface 118. 1/0
subsystem 106 optionally includes display controller 156, optical sensor controller 158,
intensity sensor controller 159, haptic feedback controller 161 and one or more input
controllers 160 for other input or control devices. The one or more input controllers 160

control devices 116 optionally include physical buttons (e.g., push buttons, rocker
buttons, etc.), dials, slider switches, joysticks, click wheels, and so forth. In some
alternate embodiments, input controller(s) 160 are, optionally, coupled to any (or none) of
the following: a keyboard, infrared port, USB port, and a pointer device such as a mouse.
The one or more buttons (e.g., 208, Fig. 2) optionally include an up/down button for
volume control of speaker 111 and/or microphone 113. The one or more buttons
optionally include a push button (e.g., 206, Fig. 2).
[0035]           Touch-sensitive display 112 provides an input interface and an output
interface between the device and a user. As described above, the touch-sensitive
operation and the display operation of touch-sensitive display 112 are optionally
separated from each other, such that a display device is used for display purposes and a
touch-sensitive surface (whether display or not) is used for input detection purposes, and
the described components and functions are modified accordingly. However, for
simplicity, the following description is provided with reference to a touch-sensitive
display. Display controller 156 receives and/or sends electrical signals from/to touch
screen 112. Touch screen 112 displays visual output to the user. The visual output
optionally includes graphics, text, icons, video, and any combination thereof (collectively
                                                -9-

WO 2015/200228                                                            PCT/US2015/037030
termed "graphics"). In some embodiments, some or all of the visual output corresponds
to user-interface objects.
[0036]          Touch screen 112 has a touch-sensitive surface, sensor or set of sensors
that accepts input from the user based on haptic and/or tactile contact. Touch screen 112
and display controller 156 (along with any associated modules and/or sets of instructions
in memory 102) detect contact (and any movement or breaking of the contact) on touch
screen 112 and converts the detected contact into interaction with user-interface objects
(e.g., one or more soft keys, icons, web pages or images) that are displayed on touch
screen 112. In an exemplary embodiment, a point of contact between touch screen 112
and the user corresponds to a finger of the user.
[0037]          Touch screen 112 optionally uses LCD (liquid crystal display) technology,
LPD (light emitting polymer display) technology, or LED (light emitting diode)
technology, although other display technologies are used in other embodiments. Touch
screen 112 and display controller 156 optionally detect contact and any movement or
breaking thereof using any of a plurality of touch sensing technologies now known or
later developed, including but not limited to capacitive, resistive, infrared, and surface
acoustic wave technologies, as well as other proximity sensor arrays or other elements for
determining one or more points of contact with touch screen 112. In an exemplary
embodiment, projected mutual capacitance sensing technology is used, such as that found
in the iPhone@, iPod Touch@, and iPad@ from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California.
[0038]          Touch screen 112 optionally has a video resolution in excess of 100 dpi.
In some embodiments, the touch screen has a video resolution of approximately 160 dpi.
The user optionally makes contact with touch screen 112 using any suitable object or
appendage, such as a stylus, a finger, and so forth. In some embodiments, the user
interface is designed to work primarily with finger-based contacts and gestures, which
can be less precise than stylus-based input due to the larger area of contact of a finger on
the touch screen. In some embodiments, the device translates the rough finger-based
input into a precise pointer/cursor position or command for performing the actions desired
by the user.
[0039]          In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, device 100
optionally includes a touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular
                                             -10-

WO 2015/200228                                                            PCT/US2015/037030
functions. In some embodiments, the touchpad is a touch-sensitive area of the device
that, unlike the touch screen, does not display visual output. The touchpad is, optionally,
a touch-sensitive surface that is separate from touch screen 112 or an extension of the
touch-sensitive surface formed by the touch screen.
[0040]           Device 100 also includes power system 162 for powering the various
components. Power system 162 optionally includes a power management system, one or
more power sources (e.g., battery, alternating current (AC)), a recharging system, a power
failure detection circuit, a power converter or inverter, a power status indicator (e.g., a
light-emitting diode (LED)) and any other components associated with the generation,
management and distribution of power in portable or non-portable devices.
[0041]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more optical sensors 164.
Fig. 1A shows an optical sensor coupled to optical sensor controller 158 in 1/0 subsystem
 106. Optical sensor 164 optionally includes charge-coupled device (CCD) or
complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) phototransistors. Optical sensor 164
receives light from the environment, projected through one or more lens, and converts the
light to data representing an image. In conjunction with imaging module 143 (also called
a camera module), optical sensor 164 optionally captures still images or video. In some
embodiments, an optical sensor is located on the back of device 100, opposite touch
screen display 112 on the front of the device, so that the touch screen display is enabled
for use as a viewfinder for still and/or video image acquisition. In some embodiments,
another optical sensor is located on the front of the device so that the user's image is,
optionally, obtained for videoconferencing while the user views the other video
conference participants on the touch screen display.
[0042]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more contact intensity sensors
 165. Fig. 1A shows a contact intensity sensor coupled to intensity sensor controller 159
in 1/0 subsystem 106. Contact intensity sensor 165 optionally includes one or more
piezoresistive strain gauges, capacitive force sensors, electric force sensors, piezoelectric
force sensors, optical force sensors, capacitive touch-sensitive surfaces, or other intensity
sensors (e.g., sensors used to measure the force (or pressure) of a contact on a touch
sensitive surface). Contact intensity sensor 165 receives contact intensity information
(e.g., pressure information or a proxy for pressure information) from the environment. In
some embodiments, at least one contact intensity sensor is collocated with, or proximate
                                              -11-

to, a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112). In some
embodiments, at least one contact intensity sensor is located on the back of device 100,
opposite touch screen display 112 which is located on the front of device 100.
[0043]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more proximity sensors 166.
Fig. 1A shows proximity sensor 166 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately,
proximity sensor 166 is coupled to input controller 160 in 1/0 subsystem 106. In some
embodiments, the proximity sensor turns off and disables touch screen 112 when the
multifunction device is placed near the user's ear (e.g., when the user is making a phone
call).
[0044]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more tactile output generators
167. Fig. 1A shows a tactile output generator coupled to haptic feedback controller 161
in 1/0 subsystem 106. Tactile output generator 167 optionally includes one or more
electroacoustic devices such as speakers or other audio components and/or
electromechanical devices that convert energy into linear motion such as a motor,
solenoid, electroactive polymer, piezoelectric actuator, electrostatic actuator, or other
tactile output generating component (e.g., a component that converts electrical signals
into tactile outputs on the device). Contact intensity sensor 165 receives tactile feedback
generation instructions from haptic feedback module 133 and generates tactile outputs on
device 100 that are capable of being sensed by a user of device 100. In some
embodiments, at least one tactile output generator is collocated with, or proximate to, a
touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112) and, optionally,
generates a tactile output by moving the touch-sensitive surface vertically (e.g., in/out of a
surface of device 100) or laterally (e.g., back and forth in the same plane as a surface of
device 100). In some embodiments, at least one tactile output generator sensor is located
on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112 which is located on the front
of device 100.
[0045]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more accelerometers 168. Fig.
1A shows accelerometer 168 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately,
accelerometer 168 is, optionally, coupled to an input controller 160 in 1/0 subsystem 106.
In some embodiments, information is displayed on the touch screen display in a portrait
view or a landscape view based on an analysis of data received from the one or more
accelerometers. Device 100 optionally includes, in addition to accelerometer(s) 168, a
                                              -12-

magnetometer (not shown) and a GPS (or GLONASS or other global navigation system)
receiver (not shown) for obtaining information concerning the location and orientation
(e.g., portrait or landscape) of device 100.
[0046]           In some embodiments, the software components stored in memory 102
include operating system 126, communication module (or set of instructions) 128,
contact/motion module (or set of instructions) 130, graphics module (or set of
instructions) 132, text input module (or set of instructions) 134, Global Positioning
System (GPS) module (or set of instructions) 135, and applications (or sets of
instructions) 136. Furthermore, in some embodiments memory 102 stores device/global
internal state 157, as shown in Figs. 1A and 3. Device/global internal state 157 includes
one or more of: active application state, indicating which applications, if any, are
currently active; display state, indicating what applications, views or other information
occupy various regions of touch screen display 112; sensor state, including information
obtained from the device's various sensors and input control devices 116; and location
information concerning the device's location and/or attitude.
[0047]           Operating system 126 (e.g., Darwin, RTXC, LINUX, UNIX, OS X,
WINDOWS, or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks) includes various
software components and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system tasks
(e.g., memory management, storage device control, power management, etc.) and
facilitates communication between various hardware and software components.
[0048]           Communication module 128 facilitates communication with other devices
over one or more external ports 124 and also includes various software components for
handling data received by RF circuitry 108 and/or external port 124. External port 124
(e.g., Universal Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to
other devices or indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.). In some
embodiments, the external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as,
or similar to and/or compatible with the 30-pin connector used on iPod (trademark of
Apple Inc.) devices.
[0049]           Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects contact with touch screen
 112 (in conjunction with display controller 156) and other touch-sensitive devices (e.g., a
touchpad or physical click wheel). Contact/motion module 130 includes various software
                                             -13-

WO 2015/200228                                                             PCT/US2015/037030
components for performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as
determining if contact has occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining an
intensity of the contact (e.g., the force or pressure of the contact or a substitute for the
force or pressure of the contact) determining if there is movement of the contact and
tracking the movement across the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more
finger-dragging events), and determining if the contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a
finger-up event or a break in contact). Contact/motion module 130 receives contact data
from the touch-sensitive surface. Determining movement of the point of contact, which is
represented by a series of contact data, optionally includes determining speed
(magnitude), velocity (magnitude and direction), and/or an acceleration (a change in
magnitude and/or direction) of the point of contact. These operations are, optionally,
applied to single contacts (e.g., one finger contacts) or to multiple simultaneous contacts
(e.g., "multitouch"/multiple finger contacts). In some embodiments, contact/motion
module 130 and display controller 156 detect contact on a touchpad.
[0050]          In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 uses a set of one or
more intensity thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user
(e.g., to determine whether a user has "clicked" on an icon). In some embodiments at
least a subset of the intensity thresholds are determined in accordance with software
parameters (e.g., the intensity thresholds are not determined by the activation thresholds
of particular physical actuators and can be adjusted without changing the physical
hardware of device 100). For example, a mouse "click" threshold of a trackpad or touch
screen display can be set to any of a large range of predefined thresholds values without
changing the trackpad or touch screen display hardware. Additionally, in some
implementations a user of the device is provided with software settings for adjusting one
or more of the set of intensity thresholds (e.g., by adjusting individual intensity thresholds
and/or by adjusting a plurality of intensity thresholds at once with a system-level click
"intensity" parameter).
[0051]          Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects a gesture input by a user.
Different gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns and
intensities. Thus, a gesture is, optionally, detected by detecting a particular contact
pattern. For example, detecting a finger tap gesture includes detecting a finger-down
event followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off) event at the same position (or
                                               -14-

substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g., at the position of an icon).
As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the touch-sensitive surface
includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or more finger
dragging events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off) event.
[0052]           Graphics module 132 includes various known software components for
rendering and displaying graphics on touch screen 112 or other display, including
components for changing the visual impact (e.g., brightness, transparency, saturation,
contrast or other visual property) of graphics that are displayed. As used herein, the term
"graphics" includes any object that can be displayed to a user, including without
limitation text, web pages, icons (such as user-interface objects including soft keys),
digital images, videos, animations and the like.
[0053]           In some embodiments, graphics module 132 stores data representing
graphics to be used. Each graphic is, optionally, assigned a corresponding code.
Graphics module 132 receives, from applications etc., one or more codes specifying
graphics to be displayed along with, if necessary, coordinate data and other graphic
property data, and then generates screen image data to output to display controller 156.
[0054]           Haptic feedback module 133 includes various software components for
generating instructions used by tactile output generator(s) 167 to produce tactile outputs
at one or more locations on device 100 in response to user interactions with device 100.
[0055]           Text input module 134, which is, optionally, a component of graphics
module 132, provides soft keyboards for entering text in various applications (e.g.,
contacts 137, e-mail 140, IM 141, browser 147, and any other application that needs text
input).
[0056]           GPS module 135 determines the location of the device and provides this
information for use in various applications (e.g., to telephone 138 for use in location
based dialing, to camera 143 as picture/video metadata, and to applications that provide
location-based services such as weather widgets, local yellow page widgets, and
map/navigation widgets).

on an external, connected display via external port 124). In some embodiments, device
100 optionally includes the functionality of an MP3 player, such as an iPod (trademark of
Apple Inc.).
[0073]          In conjunction with touch screen 112, display controller 156, contact
module 130, graphics module 132, and text input module 134, notes module 153 includes
executable instructions to create and manage notes, to do lists, and the like in accordance
with user instructions.
[0074]          In conjunction with RF circuitry 108, touch screen 112, display system
controller 156, contact module 130, graphics module 132, text input module 134, GPS
module 135, and browser module 147, map module 154 are, optionally, used to receive,
display, modify, and store maps and data associated with maps (e.g., driving directions;
data on stores and other points of interest at or near a particular location; and other
location-based data) in accordance with user instructions.
[0075]          In conjunction with touch screen 112, display system controller 156,

108, text input module 134, e-mail client module 140, and browser module 147, online
video module 155 includes instructions that allow the user to access, browse, receive
(e.g., by streaming and/or download), play back (e.g., on the touch screen or on an
external, connected display via external port 124), send an e-mail with a link to a
particular online video, and otherwise manage online videos in one or more file formats,
such as H.264. In some embodiments, instant messaging module 141, rather than e-mail
client module 140, is used to send a link to a particular online video.
[0076]          Each of the above identified modules and applications correspond to a set
of executable instructions for performing one or more functions described above and the
methods described in this application (e.g., the computer-implemented methods and other
information processing methods described herein). These modules (e.g., sets of
instructions) need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures or
modules, and thus various subsets of these modules are, optionally, combined or
otherwise re-arranged in various embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102
optionally stores a subset of the modules and data structures identified above.
                                             -20-

WO 2015/200228                                                           PCT/US2015/037030
Furthermore, memory 102 optionally stores additional modules and data structures not
described above.
[0077]          In some embodiments, device 100 is a device where operation of a
predefined set of functions on the device is performed exclusively through a touch screen
and/or a touchpad (whether included in device 100 or on a separate device, such as an
input device). By using a touch screen and/or a touchpad as the primary input control
device for operation of device 100, the number of physical input control devices (such as
push buttons, dials, and the like) on device 100 is, optionally, reduced.
[0078]          The predefined set of functions that are performed exclusively through a
touch screen and/or a touchpad optionally include navigation between user interfaces. In
some embodiments, the touchpad, when touched by the user, navigates device 100 to a
main, home, or root menu from any user interface that is displayed on device 100. In
such embodiments, a "menu button" is implemented using a touchpad. In some other
embodiments, the menu button is a physical push button or other physical input control
device instead of a touchpad.
[0079]          Fig. lB is a block diagram illustrating exemplary components for event
handling in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102 (in
Fig. 1A) or 370 (Fig. 3) includes event sorter 170 (e.g., in operating system 126) and a
respective application 136-1 (e.g., any of the aforementioned applications 137-151, 155,
380-390).
[0080]          Event sorter 170 receives event information and determines the application
 136-1 and application view 191 of application 136-1 to which to deliver the event
information. Event sorter 170 includes event monitor 171 and event dispatcher module
 174. In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes application internal state 192,
which indicates the current application view(s) displayed on touch-sensitive display 112
when the application is active or executing. In some embodiments, device/global internal
state 157 is used by event sorter 170 to determine which application(s) is (are) currently
active, and application internal state 192 is used by event sorter 170 to determine
application views 191 to which to deliver event information.
[0081]          In some embodiments, application internal state 192 includes additional
information, such as one or more of: resume information to be used when application
                                              -21-

WO 2015/200228                                                            PCT/US2015/037030
 136-1 resumes execution, user interface state information that indicates information being
displayed or that is ready for display by application 136-1, a state queue for enabling the
user to go back to a prior state or view of application 136-1, and a redo/undo queue of
previous actions taken by the user.
[0082]          Event monitor 171 receives event information from peripherals interface
 118. Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on
touch-sensitive display 112, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals interface 118
transmits information it receives from I/O subsystem 106 or a sensor, such as proximity
sensor 166, accelerometer(s) 168, and/or microphone 113 (through audio circuitry 110).
Information that peripherals interface 118 receives from I/O subsystem 106 includes
information from touch-sensitive display 112 or a touch-sensitive surface.
[0083]          In some embodiments, event monitor 171 sends requests to the peripherals
interface 118 at predetermined intervals. In response, peripherals interface 118 transmits
event information. In other embodiments, peripheral interface 118 transmits event
information only when there is a significant event (e.g., receiving an input above a
predetermined noise threshold and/or for more than a predetermined duration).
[0084]          In some embodiments, event sorter 170 also includes a hit view
determination module 172 and/or an active event recognizer determination module 173.
[0085]          Hit view determination module 172 provides software procedures for
determining where a sub-event has taken place within one or more views, when touch
sensitive display 112 displays more than one view. Views are made up of controls and
other elements that a user can see on the display.
[0086]          Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set
of views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which
information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application views (of a
respective application) in which a touch is detected optionally correspond to
programmatic levels within a programmatic or view hierarchy of the application. For
example, the lowest level view in which a touch is detected is, optionally, called the hit
view, and the set of events that are recognized as proper inputs are, optionally,
determined based, at least in part, on the hit view of the initial touch that begins a touch
based gesture.
                                              -22-

WO 2015/200228                                                           PCT/US2015/037030
[0087]          Hit view determination module 172 receives information related to
sub-events of a touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views organized
in a hierarchy, hit view determination module 172 identifies a hit view as the lowest view
in the hierarchy which should handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view
is the lowest level view in which an initiating sub-event occurs (e.g., the first sub-event in
the sequence of sub-events that form an event or potential event). Once the hit view is
identified by the hit view determination module, the hit view typically receives all sub
events related to the same touch or input source for which it was identified as the hit
view.
[0088]          Active event recognizer determination module 173 determines which view
or views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In
some embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines that
only the hit view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other
embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines that all
views that include the physical location of a sub-event are actively involved views, and
therefore determines that all actively involved views should receive a particular sequence
of sub-events. In other embodiments, even if touch sub-events were entirely confined to
the area associated with one particular view, views higher in the hierarchy would still
remain as actively involved views.
[0089]          Event dispatcher module 174 dispatches the event information to an event
recognizer (e.g., event recognizer 180). In embodiments including active event
recognizer determination module 173, event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event
information to an event recognizer determined by active event recognizer determination
module 173. In some embodiments, event dispatcher module 174 stores in an event
queue the event information, which is retrieved by a respective event receiver module
 182.
[0090]          In some embodiments, operating system 126 includes event sorter 170.
Alternatively, application 136-1 includes event sorter 170. In yet other embodiments,
event sorter 170 is a stand-alone module, or a part of another module stored in memory
 102, such as contact/motion module 130.

WO 2015/200228                                                            PCT/US2015/037030
[0091]           In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes a plurality of event
handlers 190 and one or more application views 191, each of which includes instructions
for handling touch events that occur within a respective view of the application's user
interface. Each application view 191 of the application 136-1 includes one or more event
recognizers 180. Typically, a respective application view 191 includes a plurality of
event recognizers 180. In other embodiments, one or more of event recognizers 180 are
part of a separate module, such as a user interface kit (not shown) or a higher level object
from which application 136-1 inherits methods and other properties. In some
embodiments, a respective event handler 190 includes one or more of: data updater 176,
object updater 177, GUI updater 178, and/or event data 179 received from event sorter
 170. Event handler 190 optionally utilizes or calls data updater 176, object updater 177
or GUI updater 178 to update the application internal state 192. Alternatively, one or
more of the application views 191 includes one or more respective event handlers 190.
Also, in some embodiments, one or more of data updater 176, object updater 177, and
GUI updater 178 are included in a respective application view 191.
[0092]           A respective event recognizer 180 receives event information (e.g., event
data 179) from event sorter 170, and identifies an event from the event information.
Event recognizer 180 includes event receiver 182 and event comparator 184. In some
embodiments, event recognizer 180 also includes at least a subset of: metadata 183, and
event delivery instructions 188 (which optionally include sub-event delivery instructions).
[0093]           Event receiver 182 receives event information from event sorter 170. The
event information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or a touch
movement. Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes additional
information, such as location of the sub-event. When the sub-event concerns motion of a
touch, the event information optionally also includes speed and direction of the sub-event.
In some embodiments, events include rotation of the device from one orientation to
another (e.g., from a portrait orientation to a landscape orientation, or vice versa), and the
event information includes corresponding information about the current orientation (also
called device attitude) of the device.
[0094]           Event comparator 184 compares the event information to predefined event
or sub-event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or sub-event,
or determines or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some embodiments, event
                                              -24-

WO 2015/200228                                                           PCT/US2015/037030
comparator 184 includes event definitions 186. Event definitions 186 contain definitions
of events (e.g., predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event 1 (187-1), event 2
(187-2), and others. In some embodiments, sub-events in an event 187 include, for
example, touch begin, touch end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple
touching. In one example, the definition for event 1 (187-1) is a double tap on a
displayed object. The double tap, for example, comprises a first touch (touch begin) on
the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a first lift-off (touch end) for a
predetermined phase, a second touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a
predetermined phase, and a second lift-off (touch end) for a predetermined phase. In
another example, the definition for event 2 (187-2) is a dragging on a displayed object.
The dragging, for example, comprises a touch (or contact) on the displayed object for a
predetermined phase, a movement of the touch across touch-sensitive display 112, and
lift-off of the touch (touch end). In some embodiments, the event also includes
information for one or more associated event handlers 190.
[0095]            In some embodiments, event definition 187 includes a definition of an
event for a respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator 184
performs a hit test to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event.
For example, in an application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on
touch-sensitive display 112, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display 112,
event comparator 184 performs a hit test to determine which of the three user-interface
objects is associated with the touch (sub-event). If each displayed object is associated
with a respective event handler 190, the event comparator uses the result of the hit test to
determine which event handler 190 should be activated. For example, event comparator
 184 selects an event handler associated with the sub-event and the object triggering the hit
test.
[0096]            In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event 187 also
includes delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been
determined whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event
recognizer's event type.
[0097]           When a respective event recognizer 180 determines that the series of sub
events do not match any of the events in event definitions 186, the respective event
recognizer 180 enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which
                                             -25-

WO 2015/200228                                                           PCT/US2015/037030
it disregards subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other
event recognizers, if any, that remain active for the hit view continue to track and process
sub-events of an ongoing touch-based gesture.
[0098]            In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 includes
metadata 183 with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event
delivery system should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers.
In some embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists
that indicate how event recognizers interact, or are enabled to interact, with one another.
In some embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists
that indicate whether sub-events are delivered to varying levels in the view or
programmatic hierarchy.
[0099]            In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 activates event
handler 190 associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event
are recognized. In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 delivers event
information associated with the event to event handler 190. Activating an event handler
 190 is distinct from sending (and deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In
some embodiments, event recognizer 180 throws a flag associated with the recognized
event, and event handler 190 associated with the flag catches the flag and performs a
predefined process.
[00100]           In some embodiments, event delivery instructions 188 include sub-event
delivery instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating
an event handler. Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to
event handlers associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views.
Event handlers associated with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views
receive the event information and perform a predetermined process.
[00101]           In some embodiments, data updater 176 creates and updates data used in
application 136-1. For example, data updater 176 updates the telephone number used in
contacts module 137, or stores a video file used in video player module 145. In some
embodiments, object updater 177 creates and updates objects used in application 136-1.
For example, object updater 176 creates a new user-interface object or updates the
position of a user-interface object. GUI updater 178 updates the GUI. For example, GUI
                                             -26-

updater 178 prepares display information and sends it to graphics module 132 for display
on a touch-sensitive display.
[00102]         In some embodiments, event handler(s) 190 includes or has access to data
updater 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178. In some embodiments, data
updater 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a single module of
a respective application 136-1 or application view 191. In other embodiments, they are
included in two or more software modules.
[00103]         It shall be understood that the foregoing discussion regarding event
handling of user touches on touch-sensitive displays and/or touchpads also applies to
other forms of user inputs to operate multifunction devices 100 with input-devices, not all
of which are initiated on touch screens. For example, mouse movement and mouse
button presses, optionally coordinated with single or multiple keyboard presses or holds;
contact movements such as taps, drags, scrolls, etc., on touch-pads; pen stylus inputs;
movement of the device; oral instructions; detected eye movements; biometric inputs;
and/or any combination thereof are optionally utilized as inputs corresponding to sub
events which define an event to be recognized.
[00104]         Fig. 2 illustrates a portable or non-portable multifunction device 100
having a touch screen 112 in accordance with some embodiments. As stated above,
multifunction device 100 is described as having the various illustrated structures (such as
touch screen 112, speaker 111, accelerometer 168, microphone 113, etc.); however, it is
understood that these structures optionally reside on separate devices. For example,
display-related structures (e.g., display, speaker, etc.) and/or functions optionally reside
on a separate display device, input-related structures (e.g., touch-sensitive surface,
microphone, accelerometer, etc.) and/or functions optionally reside on a separate input
device, and remaining structures and/or functions optionally reside on multifunction
device 100.
[00105]         The touch screen 112 optionally displays one or more graphics within user
interface (UI) 200. In this embodiment, as well as others described below, a user is
enabled to select one or more of the graphics by making a gesture on the graphics, for
example, with one or more fingers 202 (not drawn to scale in the figure) or one or more
styluses 203 (not drawn to scale in the figure). In some embodiments, selection of one or
                                               -27-

WO 2015/200228                                                           PCT/US2015/037030
more graphics occurs when the user breaks contact with the one or more graphics. In
some embodiments, the gesture optionally includes one or more taps, one or more swipes
(from left to right, right to left, upward and/or downward) and/or a rolling of a finger
(from right to left, left to right, upward and/or downward) that has made contact with
device 100. In some implementations or circumstances, inadvertent contact with a
graphic does not select the graphic. For example, a swipe gesture that sweeps over an
application icon optionally does not select the corresponding application when the gesture
corresponding to selection is a tap.
[00106]          Device 100 optionally also includes one or more physical buttons, such as
"home" or menu button 204. As described previously, menu button 204 is, optionally,
used to navigate to any application 136 in a set of applications that are, optionally
executed on device 100. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the menu button is
implemented as a soft key in a GUI displayed on touch screen 112.
[00107]          In one embodiment, device 100 includes touch screen 112, menu button
204, push button 206 for powering the device on/off and locking the device, volume
adjustment button(s) 208, Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card slot 210, head set jack
212, and docking/charging external port 124. Push button 206 is, optionally, used to turn
the power on/off on the device by depressing the button and holding the button in the
depressed state for a predefined time interval; to lock the device by depressing the button
and releasing the button before the predefined time interval has elapsed; and/or to unlock
the device or initiate an unlock process. In an alternative embodiment, device 100 also
accepts verbal input for activation or deactivation of some functions through microphone
 113. Device 100 also, optionally, includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165 for
detecting intensity of contacts on touch screen 112 and/or one or more tactile output
generators 167 for generating tactile outputs for a user of device 100.
[00108]          Fig. 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary multifunction device with a
display and a touch-sensitive surface in accordance with some embodiments. Device 300
need not include the display and the touch-sensitive surface, as described above, but

sensitive surface on other devices. Additionally, device 300 need not be portable. In
some embodiments, device 300 is a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a tablet

device, an educational device (such as a child's learning toy), a gaming system, or a
control device (e.g., a home or industrial controller). Device 300 typically includes one
or more processing units (CPU's) 310, one or more network or other communications
interfaces 360, memory 370, and one or more communication buses 320 for
interconnecting these components. Communication buses 320 optionally include
circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls communications
between system components. Device 300 includes input/output (1/0) interface 330
comprising display 340, which is typically a touch screen display. 1/0 interface 330 also
optionally includes a keyboard and/or mouse (or other pointing device) 350 and touchpad
355, tactile output generator 357 for generating tactile outputs on device 300 (e.g., similar
to tactile output generator(s) 167 described above with reference to Fig. 1A), sensors 359
(e.g., optical, acceleration, proximity, touch-sensitive, and/or contact intensity sensors
similar to contact intensity sensor(s) 165 described above with reference to Fig. 1A).
Memory 370 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR
RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and optionally includes non
volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage
devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices. Memory
370 optionally includes one or more storage devices remotely located from CPU(s) 310.
In some embodiments, memory 370 stores programs, modules, and data structures
analogous to the programs, modules, and data structures stored in memory 102 of
portable or non-portable multifunction device 100 (Fig. 1A), or a subset thereof.
Furthermore, memory 370 optionally stores additional programs, modules, and data
structures not present in memory 102 of portable or non-portable multifunction device
100. For example, memory 370 of device 300 optionally stores drawing module 380,
presentation module 382, word processing module 384, website creation module 386,
disk authoring module 388, and/or spreadsheet module 390, while memory 102 of
portable or non-portable multifunction device 100 (Fig. 1A) optionally does not store
these modules.
[00109]          Each of the above identified elements in Fig. 3 are, optionally, stored in
one or more of the previously mentioned memory devices. Each of the above identified

implemented as separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus various
subsets of these modules are, optionally, combined or otherwise re-arranged in various
embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 370 optionally stores a subset of the

additional modules and data structures not described above.
[00110]         Fig. 4 illustrates an exemplary user interface on a device (e.g., device 300,
Fig. 3) with a touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a tablet or touchpad 355, Fig. 3) that is
separate from the display 450 (e.g., touch screen display 112). Device 300 also,
optionally, includes one or more contact intensity sensors (e.g., one or more of sensors
357) for detecting intensity of contacts on touch-sensitive surface 451 and/or one or more
tactile output generators 359 for generating tactile outputs for a user of device 300.
[00111]         Although some of the examples which follow will be given with reference
to inputs on touch screen display 112 (where the touch sensitive surface and the display
are combined), in some embodiments, the device detects inputs on a touch-sensitive
surface that is separate from the display, as shown in Fig. 4. In some embodiments the
touch sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in Fig. 4) has a primary axis (e.g., 452 in Fig. 4) that
corresponds to a primary axis (e.g., 453 in Fig. 4) on the display (e.g., 450). In
accordance with these embodiments, the device detects contacts (e.g., 460 and 462 in Fig.
4) with the touch-sensitive surface 451 at locations that correspond to respective locations
on the display (e.g., in Fig. 4, 460 corresponds to 468 and 462 corresponds to 470). In
this way, user inputs (e.g., contacts 460 and 462, and movements thereof) detected by the
device on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in Fig. 4) are used by the device to
manipulate the user interface on the display (e.g., 450 in Fig. 4) of the multifunction
device when the touch-sensitive surface is separate from the display. It should be
understood that similar methods are, optionally, used for other user interfaces described
herein.
[00112]         Additionally, while the following examples are given primarily with
reference to finger inputs (e.g., finger contacts, finger tap gestures, finger swipe gestures),
it should be understood that, in some embodiments, one or more of the finger inputs are
replaced with input from another input device (e.g., a mouse based input or stylus input).
For example, a swipe gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click (e.g., instead of a
contact) followed by movement of the cursor along the path of the swipe (e.g., instead of
                                              -30-

WO 2015/200228                                                             PCT/US2015/037030
movement of the contact). As another example, a tap gesture is, optionally, replaced with
a mouse click while the cursor is located over the location of the tap gesture (e.g., instead
of detection of the contact followed by ceasing to detect the contact). Similarly, when
multiple user inputs are simultaneously detected, it should be understood that multiple
computer mice are, optionally, used simultaneously, or a mouse and finger contacts are,
optionally, used simultaneously.
[00113]          As used herein, the term "focus selector" refers to an input element that
indicates a current part of a user interface with which a user is interacting. In some
implementations that include a cursor or other location marker, the cursor acts as a "focus
selector," so that when an input (e.g., a press input) is detected on a touch-sensitive
surface (e.g., touchpad 355 in Fig. 3 or touch-sensitive surface 451 in Fig. 4) while the
cursor is over a particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider or other
user interface element), the particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance
with the detected input. In some implementations that include a touch-screen display
(e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112 in Fig. 1A) that enables direct interaction with
user interface elements on the touch-screen display, a detected contact on the touch
screen acts as a "focus selector," so that when an input (e.g., a press input by the contact)
is detected on the touch-screen display at a location of a particular user interface element
(e.g., a button, window, slider or other user interface element), the particular user
interface element is adjusted in accordance with the detected input. In some
implementations focus is moved from one region of a user interface to another region of
the user interface without corresponding movement of a cursor or movement of a contact
on a touch-screen display (e.g., by using a tab key or arrow keys to move focus from one
button to another button); in these implementations, the focus selector moves in
accordance with movement of focus between different regions of the user interface.
Without regard to the specific form taken by the focus selector, the focus selector is
generally the user interface element (or contact on a touch-screen display) that is
controlled by the user so as to communicate the user's intended interaction with the user
interface (e.g., by indicating, to the device, the element of the user interface with which
the user is intending to interact). For example, the location of a focus selector (e.g., a
cursor, a contact or a selection box) over a respective button while a press input is
detected on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touchpad or touch screen) will indicate that
                                               -31-

WO 2015/200228                                                             PCT/US2015/037030
the user is intending to activate the respective button (as opposed to other user interface
elements shown on a display of the device).
[00114]          In some embodiments described herein, one or more operations are
performed in response to detecting a gesture that includes a respective press input or in
response to detecting the respective press input performed with a respective contact (or a
plurality of contacts), where the respective press input is detected based at least in part on
detecting an increase in intensity of the contact (or plurality of contacts) above a press
input intensity threshold. In some embodiments, the respective operation is performed in
response to detecting the increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press
input intensity threshold (e.g., a "down stroke" of the respective press input). In some
embodiments, the press input includes an increase in intensity of the respective contact
above the press-input intensity threshold and a subsequent decrease in intensity of the
contact below the press-input intensity threshold, and the respective operation is
performed in response to detecting the subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective
contact below the press-input threshold (e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input).
[00115]          In some embodiments, the device employs intensity hysteresis to avoid
accidental inputs sometimes termed "jitter," where the device defines or selects a
hysteresis intensity threshold with a predefined relationship to the press-input intensity
threshold (e.g., the hysteresis intensity threshold is X intensity units lower than the press
input intensity threshold or the hysteresis intensity threshold is 75%, 90% or some
reasonable proportion of the press-input intensity threshold). Thus, in some
embodiments, the press input includes an increase in intensity of the respective contact
above the press-input intensity threshold and a subsequent decrease in intensity of the
contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold that corresponds to the press-input
intensity threshold, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the
subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below the hysteresis intensity
threshold (e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input). Similarly, in some
embodiments, the press input is detected only when the device detects an increase in
intensity of the contact from an intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity threshold to
an intensity at or above the press-input intensity threshold and, optionally, a subsequent
decrease in intensity of the contact to an intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity, and
the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the press input (e.g., the
                                              -32-

WO 2015/200228                                                            PCT/US2015/037030
increase in intensity of the contact or the decrease in intensity of the contact, depending
on the circumstances).
[00116]          For ease of explanation, the description of operations performed in
response to a press input associated with a press-input intensity threshold or in response
to a gesture including the press input are, optionally, triggered in response to detecting
either: an increase in intensity of a contact above the press-input intensity threshold, an
increase in intensity of a contact from an intensity below the hysteresis intensity threshold
to an intensity above the press-input intensity threshold, a decrease in intensity of the
contact below the press-input intensity threshold, and/or a decrease in intensity of the
contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold corresponding to the press-input intensity
threshold. Additionally, in examples where an operation is described as being performed
in response to detecting a decrease in intensity of a contact below the press-input intensity
threshold, the operation is, optionally, performed in response to detecting a decrease in
intensity of the contact below a hysteresis intensity threshold corresponding to, and lower
than, the press-input intensity threshold.

                 USER INTERFACES AND ASSOCIATED PROCESSES
                       Spatial and Temporal Character Recognition
[00119]         Accurate recognition of handwritten character input to a device is
generally desirable, as accurate recognition reduces unwanted input to the device by a
user. The embodiments described below provide ways to provide for accurate
handwritten character input recognition on a device, thus enhancing the user's interaction
with the device. Enhancing interactions with a device reduces the amount of time needed
by a user to perform operations, and thus reduces the power usage of the device and
increases battery life for battery-powered devices.
[00120]         It is understood that people use devices. When a person uses a device, that
person is optionally referred to as a user of the device. Thus, in this disclosure, references
to a "person" or "people" are optionally interchangeable with references to a "user" or
"users", and references to a "user" or "users" are optionally interchangeable with
references to a "person" or "people".
[00121]         Figs. 6A-6D illustrate exemplary ways in which handwritten character
input to a device is recognized in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.
                                              -34-

WO 2015/200228                                                           PCT/US2015/037030
The embodiments in these figures are used to illustrate the processes described below,
including the processes described with reference to Figs. 7A-7D.
[00122]         Fig. 6A illustrates an exemplary input detected on a touch-sensitive
surface of the disclosure. Touch-sensitive surface 451 optionally corresponds to a touch
sensitive surface on remote 510 in Fig. 5. The input illustrated in Fig. 6A optionally
includes movement of contact 601 in an upward-rightward direction. The movement of
contact 601 optionally defines stroke 602. In some embodiments, a stroke is defined as
the movement of a contact from touchdown of the contact to liftoff of the contact. In
some embodiments, a stroke is defined as the movement of a contact from a start of
motion of the contact until the contact has been substantially stationary (e.g., has moved
less than a threshold amount in distance and/or speed) for at least a threshold amount of
time.
[00123]         Stroke 602 optionally includes a spatial component and a temporal
component. The spatial component of stroke 602 optionally describes the final shape or
appearance of stroke 602-in this case, a diagonal line tiled to the right. The temporal
component of stroke 602 optionally describes what stroke 602 looked like over time. For
example, the temporal component of stroke 602 optionally includes information
identifying where stroke 602 began (e.g., in this case, in a bottom-left position on touch
sensitive surface 451), and how stroke 602 progressed as a function of time (e.g., in this
case, in an upward-rightward direction, ending in a top-right position on touch-sensitive
surface 451).
[00124]         In recognizing a character that stroke 602 corresponds to, a device (e.g.,
device 500 in Fig. 5 in communication with touch-sensitive surface 451) optionally
analyzes the spatial component of stroke 602 and the temporal component of stroke 602.
Analyzing both the spatial and temporal components of stroke 602 will, in many
circumstances results in a more accurate determination of stroke 602's character
correspondence than analyzing the spatial component or temporal component alone, as
described below. For example, a stroke that is meant to be a lower case A but that looks
like an 0 will, in some circumstances, appear to correspond to an 0 when analyzed
spatially, but when analyzed temporally, the stroke will appear to correspond to an "a",
because the temporal component optionally indicates that there was movement of the
contact creating the tail of the "a" even if that movement overlaps with the rest of the
                                              -35-

WO 2015/200228                                                            PCT/US2015/037030
shape so that a spatial analysis of the shape looks more like an 0. This movement is
unlikely to exist if the input were an 0 and thus an 0 is an unlikely character for
insertion. Additionally, some characters are frequently drawn with a stroke starting
moving in a particular direction (e.g., down and to the left or up and to the right) and thus
a stroke that is drawn up and to the right is more likely to be the beginning of an M than
the beginning of an X.
[00125]          Fig. 6B shows a block diagram illustrating an exemplary character
recognition technique applied to a stroke. As discussed above, stroke 602 optionally
includes spatial component 604 and temporal component 606, and both components are
optionally analyzed in determining one or more characters to which the stroke
corresponds.
[00126]          The spatial component 604 of stroke 602 is optionally inputted into a
spatial probability determiner 608. Spatial probability determiner 608 optionally
determines one or more probabilities that spatial component 604 of stroke 602
corresponds to one or more respective characters. For example, spatial probability
determiner 608 optionally determines the probability that stroke 602 corresponds to one
or more of an "A", "B", "C", etc. (optionally including any other character supported by
the device of the disclosure) based on spatial component 604 (e.g., determines the
probability that stroke 602 corresponds to a particular character based on the shape of
stroke 602 when the determination is made). As shown in Fig. 6B, in some embodiments,
spatial probability determiner 608 optionally determines respective probabilities that
stroke 602 corresponds to each of characters A-Z (PIS through P26 S) based on spatial
component 604 and, optionally, one or more other non-letter characters (e.g., /, ?, #, $, @,
&, etc.). In some embodiments, probabilities 612 are ordered based on probability (e.g.,
the character to which spatial probability determiner 608 determines stroke 602 is most
likely to correspond is optionally listed first, and the character to which spatial probability
determiner 608 determines stroke 602 is least likely to correspond is optionally listed
last).
[00127]          Analogously, the temporal component 606 of stroke 602 is optionally
inputted into a temporal probability determiner 610. Temporal probability determiner
610 optionally determines one or more probabilities that temporal component 606 of
stroke 602 corresponds to one or more respective characters. For example, temporal
                                              -36-

WO 2015/200228                                                            PCT/US2015/037030
probability determiner 610 optionally determines the probability that stroke 602
corresponds to one or more of an "A", "B", "C", etc. (optionally including any other
character supported by the device of the disclosure) based on temporal component 606
(e.g., determines the probability that stroke 602 corresponds to a particular character
based on how stroke 602 looked over time and/or changes in speed of stroke 602 over
time). For example, a stroke that is meant to be a lower case A but that looks like an 0
optionally most likely corresponds to an 0 when analyzed spatially, but when analyzed
temporally, optionally most likely corresponds to an "a", because the temporal
component optionally indicates that there was movement of the contact creating the tail of
the "a" even if that movement overlaps with the rest of the shape so that a spatial analysis
of the shape looks more like an 0. This movement would not exist if the input were an
0. Additionally, some characters are frequently drawn with a stroke starting moving in a
particular direction (e.g., down and to the left or up and to the right) and thus a stroke that
is drawn up and to the right is more likely to be the beginning of an M than the beginning
of an X. As shown in Fig. 6B, in some embodiments, temporal component 606 optionally
includes information indicating that stroke 602 was drawn up and to the right, which
optionally informs how likely it is that stroke 602 corresponds to various characters such
as an "A", "M", "X", etc. As shown in Fig. 6B, in some embodiments, temporal
probability determiner 610 optionally determines respective probabilities that stroke 602
corresponds to each of characters A-Z (P1T through P 26 T) based on temporal component
606. As discussed above, in some embodiments, probabilities 614 are ordered based on
probability (e.g., the character to which temporal probability determiner 610 determines
stroke 602 is most likely to correspond is optionally listed first, and the character to which
temporal probability determiner 610 determines stroke 602 is least likely to correspond is
optionally listed last).
[00128]         Aggregate probabilities 618 (P1A through P2 6A) that stroke 602
corresponds to one or more characters are optionally determined based on spatial
probabilities 612 and temporal probabilities 614 via aggregate probability determiner 616.
In some embodiments, aggregate probability determiner 616 considers both the spatial
612 and temporal 614 probabilities in making a final determination about stroke 602. In
some embodiments, the spatial 612 and temporal 614 probabilities are multiplied to result
in aggregate probabilities 618. In some embodiments, the spatial 612 and temporal 614
                                              -37-

WO 2015/200228                                                            PCT/US2015/037030
probabilities are added together to result in aggregate probabilities 618, sometimes with
respective weighting factors. In some embodiments, probabilities 618 are ordered based
on probability (e.g., the character to which aggregate probability determiner 616
determines stroke 602 is most likely to correspond is optionally listed first, and the
character to which aggregate probability determiner 616 determines stroke 602 is least
likely to correspond is optionally listed last).
[00129]          Aggregate probabilities 618 optionally provide more accurate likelihoods
that stroke 602 corresponds to particular characters than spatial probabilities 612 or
temporal probabilities 614 alone. In some embodiments, it is necessary to determine
whether two or more handwritten input strokes correspond to a single character (e.g., are
part of the same character) or correspond to more than one character (e.g., are part of
different characters).
[00130]          Fig. 6C illustrates an exemplary input detected on a touch-sensitive
surface. The input detected on touch-sensitive surface 451 optionally includes movement
of contact 619 in a downward-rightward direction (defining stroke 620), followed by
movement of contact 621 in an upward-rightward direction (defining stroke 622). The
device of the disclosure optionally needs to determine whether strokes 620 and 622
correspond to the same character (e.g., an "X") or to different characters (e.g., stroke 620
corresponds to an "M", and stroke 622 corresponds to an "A").
[00131]          Fig. 6D shows a block diagram illustrating an exemplary character
recognition technique applied to two or more strokes. Spatial/temporal probability
determiner 624 optionally determines the probability that strokes 620 and 622 correspond
to different characters (e.g., stroke 620 corresponds to a first character, and stroke 622
corresponds to a second character). In some embodiments, this determination is
performed using the technique described in Fig. 6B, where the spatial and temporal
components of each of strokes 620 and 622 are analyzed separately. The outputs of the
technique described in Fig. 6B are then utilized to evaluate the likelihood that strokes 620
and 622 correspond to different characters (e.g., a first character followed by a second
character). In some embodiments, this determination is also based on a language model
that indicates the likelihood that the first character would be followed by the second
character in a particular language (e.g., in determining how likely it is that stroke 620
corresponds to the first character and stroke 622 corresponds to the second character, the
                                               -38-

WO 2015/200228                                                             PCT/US2015/037030
device also optionally utilizes a language model that informs how likely it is that the first
character and the second character will be found together in, for example, words in the
particular language).
[00132]         Spatial/temporal probability determiner 626 optionally determines the
probability that strokes 620 and 622 correspond to the same character (e.g., stroke 620
and stroke 622 together correspond to a single character). In some embodiments, this
determination is performed using the technique described in Fig. 6B, where the spatial
and temporal components of strokes 620 and 622 are analyzed together (e.g., as a
combination). The outputs of the technique described in Fig. 6B are then utilized to
evaluate the likelihood that strokes 620 and 622 correspond to a single character.
[00133]         Selector 628 optionally selects whichever proposition (e.g., separate
characters or the same character) is more likely based on the probabilities determined in
spatial/temporal probability determiners 624 and 626.
[00134]         It is understood that the various functional blocks illustrated in Figs. 6B
and 6D are merely illustrative, and do not limit the structure of any device of the
disclosure. For example, spatial probability determiner 608, temporal probability
determiner 610, aggregate probability determiner 616, spatial/temporal probability
determiners 624 and 626, and selector 628 are, optionally, implemented by the same
physical structure (e.g., processor, logic, etc.), or multiple physical structures.
[00135]         Figs. 7A-7D are flow diagrams illustrating a method 700 of recognizing
handwritten input in accordance with some embodiments. The method 700 is optionally
performed at an electronic device such as device 500 as described above with reference to
Fig. 5, including a set top box or other user interface generating device that is in
communication with a remote control and a display device. Some operations in method
700 are, optionally, combined and/or the order of some operations is, optionally, changed.
[00136]         As described below, the method 700 provides ways in which a device
optionally recognizes handwritten character input to the device. The method reduces the
cognitive burden on a user when interacting with a user interface of the device of the
disclosure, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery
operated electronic devices, increasing the efficiency of the user's interaction with the
user interface conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.

WO 2015/200228                                                              PCT/US2015/037030
[00137]          In some embodiments, an electronic device (e.g., a set top box or other
user interface generating device that is in communication with a remote control and a
display device, such as device 500 in Fig. 5) with one or more processors and memory
receives (702) an indication of a first input that includes movement of a contact (e.g., a
finger contact or stylus contact, such as contact 601 in Fig. 6A) detected on a touch
sensitive surface of a device (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface of a remote control or a
portable multifunction device with a touchscreen display, such as touch-sensitive surface
451 in Fig. 6A). The movement of the contact optionally comprises a first stroke (704)
(e.g., in some embodiments, a stroke is defined as the movement of a contact from
touchdown of the contact to liftoff of the contact, such as stroke 602 in Fig. 6A), and the
first stroke optionally has a spatial component (e.g., the way that the final stroke looks, or
the final shape of the stroke, such as spatial component 604 in Fig. 6B) and a temporal
component (706) (e.g., how the stroke looked over time, such as temporal component
606. For example, the temporal component of the stroke optionally includes information
as to where the stroke began, and how the stroke progressed as a function of time). In
some embodiments, the first input comprises the first stroke detected during a first time
period (e.g., stroke 620 in Fig. 6C) and a second stroke detected during a second time
period (e.g., stroke 622 in Fig. 6C), the second stroke having a spatial component and a
temporal component (708). For example, the first input is optionally the two strokes that
form an X, or the first input is an 0 followed by a U)
[00138]          In some embodiments, the electronic device determines (710) a first
probability that the first stroke corresponds to a first character (e.g., letter, number,
symbol, etc.) based on the spatial component of the first stroke (e.g., determine the
probability that the first stroke corresponds to a particular character based on the shape of
the stroke when the determination is made, such as probabilities 612 in Fig. 6B).
[00139]          In some embodiments, the electronic device determines (712) a second
probability that the first stroke corresponds to the first character based on the temporal
component of the first stroke. For example, the electronic device optionally determines
the probability that the first stroke corresponds to the particular character based on how
the stroke looked over time and/or changes in speed of the stroke over time, such as
probabilities 614 in Fig. 6B. For example, a stroke that is meant to be a lower case A but
that looks like an 0 optionally most likely corresponds to an 0 when analyzed spatially,
                                              -40-

WO 2015/200228                                                             PCT/US2015/037030
but when analyzed temporally, optionally most likely corresponds to an "a", because the
temporal component optionally indicates that there was movement of the contact creating
the tail of the "a" even if that movement overlaps with the rest of the shape so that a
spatial analysis of the shape looks more like an 0. This movement would not exist if the
input were an 0. Additionally, some characters are frequently drawn with a stroke
starting moving in a particular direction (e.g., down and to the left or up and to the right)
and thus a stroke that is drawn up and to the right is more likely to be the beginning of an
M than the beginning of an X.
[00140]          In some embodiments, the electronic device determines (714) an aggregate
probability that the first stroke corresponds to the first character based on the first
probability and the second probability (e.g., considers both the spatial and temporal
probabilities in making a final determination about the stroke, such as probabilities 618 in
Fig. 6B. In some embodiments, the spatial and temporal probabilities are multiplied. In
some embodiments, the spatial and temporal probabilities are added together, sometimes
with respective weighting factors). In some embodiments, the determinations of the first,
second and aggregate probabilities are performed while the first stroke is still being
detected (716) (e.g., at least a preliminary determination of the aggregate probability is
completed before the first stroke is completed. The determinations need not wait for the
end of the first stroke). In some embodiments, the determinations of the first, second and
aggregate probabilities are repeated periodically while the first stroke is still being
detected (718) (e.g., the spatial, temporal and aggregate probabilities are determined
multiple times per stroke, each time with larger portions of the stroke as the stroke gets
further defined with further movement of the contact. In some embodiments, the
determinations are repeated at fixed-time intervals. In some embodiments, the
determinations are triggered when there has been a change in the stroke that is greater
than a threshold amount-e.g., there is a change in direction, velocity, acceleration, etc.,
of the stroke greater than a threshold amount, and this change causes the determinations
to be made).
[00141]          In some embodiments, while the first stroke is still being detected (720),
the electronic device determines (722), at a first time, a first aggregate probability that the
first stroke corresponds to the first character (e.g., makes a first aggregate probability
determination during the first stroke). In some embodiments, the electronic device further
                                              -41-

WO 2015/200228                                                              PCT/US2015/037030
provides (724) a first character suggestion for display on a display device (e.g., a
television or other display device) based on the first aggregate probability (e.g., after
determining an aggregate probability that the first stroke corresponds to the letter "a", if
the aggregate probability associated with the letter "a" is the highest aggregate probability
of aggregate probabilities associated with other characters, the electronic device displays
the letter "a" as a suggestion on the display device. In some embodiments, a user
optionally selects the suggestion to enter the letter "a" in a text field, for example, without
having to complete the stroke input as an input. If the aggregate probability associated
with another character is the highest aggregate probability, display that character as a
suggestion on the display device). In some embodiments, the electronic device further
determines (726), at a second time after the first time, a second aggregate probability that
the first stroke corresponds to the first character (e.g., makes a second aggregate
probability determination during the first stroke). In some embodiments, the electronic
device provides (728) a second character suggestion, different from the first character
suggestion, for display on the display device based on the second aggregate probability
(e.g., updates the displayed character suggestion as the aggregate probabilities associated
with characters change over time as more of the stroke has been inputted. For example,
the electronic device optionally changes the displayed character selection from a "P" to a
"D" as more of the stroke has been inputted).
[00142]          In some embodiments, the electronic device determines (730) a third
probability that the first stroke corresponds to the first character and the second stroke
corresponds to a second character based on the temporal and spatial components of the
first and second strokes (e.g., determines how likely it is that the first and second strokes
correspond to different characters, such as in spatial/temporal probability determiner 624
in Fig. 6D. In some embodiments, this determination, as above, is based on the temporal
and spatial components of each of the first and second strokes). In some embodiments,
determining the third probability comprises determining the third probability based on a
language model indicating a likelihood that the first character will be followed by the
second character in a particular language (732) (e.g., in determining how likely it is that
the first stroke corresponds to the first character and the second stroke corresponds to the
second character, the electronic device optionally also utilizes a language model that
                                              -42-

WO 2015/200228                                                               PCT/US2015/037030
informs how likely it is that the first character and the second character will be found
together in, for example, words in the particular language).
[00143]          In some embodiments, the electronic device determines (734) a fourth
probability that a combination of the first stroke and the second stroke corresponds to a
third character based on the temporal and spatial components of the combination of the
first and second strokes (e.g., determines how likely it is that the first and second strokes
together correspond to a single character, such as in spatial/temporal probability
determiner 626 in Fig. 6D. In some embodiments, this determination, as above, is based
on the temporal and spatial components of each of the first and second strokes, including
temporal and spatial components of the combination of the first and second strokes).
[00144]          In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the third
probability is higher than the fourth probability, the electronic device selects (736) the
first character and the second character as inputs (e.g., such as in selector 628 in Fig. 6D).
In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the fourth probability is
higher than the third probability, the electronic device selects (738) the third character as
an input (e.g., such as in selector 628 in Fig. 6D).
[00145]          In some embodiments, the electronic device determines (740) a plurality of
aggregate probabilities for a plurality of characters, a first aggregate probability
comprising an aggregate probability that the first stroke corresponds to a first character of
the plurality of characters and a second aggregate probability comprising an aggregate
probability that the first stroke corresponds to a second character of the plurality of
characters (e.g., determines an aggregate probability that the first stroke corresponds to an
"A", determines an aggregate probability that the first stroke corresponds to a "B",
determines an aggregate probability that the first stroke corresponds to a "C", etc.). In
some embodiments, the electronic device selects (742), from the plurality of characters, a
character having the highest aggregate probability as an input (e.g., selects "B" as an
input because its associated aggregate probability is the highest of the determined
aggregate probabilities).
[00146]          In some embodiments, the electronic device detects (744) an end of the
first stroke (e.g., detects liftoff of the contact that made the first stroke, or detects a pause
in movement of the contact that made the first stroke that indicates an end of the first
                                                 -43-

WO 2015/200228                                                               PCT/US2015/037030
stroke). In some embodiments, after detecting the end of the first stroke (746), the
electronic device detects (748) at least a portion of a second stroke. In response to
detecting the portion of the second stroke, the electronic device optionally determines
(750) whether the first stroke and the second stroke correspond to a single character based
on temporal information about the first stroke and the second stroke (e.g., determines
whether a "I"stroke followed by a "-" stroke corresponds to a "T". In some
embodiments, the two strokes correspond to an "1"followed by the beginning of an "e",
for example. For example, strokes that are close to each other in time are more likely to
be part of a single character than strokes that are further apart in time).
[00147]           In some embodiments, the second stroke spatially overlaps at least a
portion of the first stroke (e.g., the first stroke was detected in a first region of the touch
sensitive surface, and the second stroke was detected at least partially in the first region of
the touch-sensitive surface), and the first stroke and the second stroke are determined as
belonging to different characters based at least in part on the temporal information (752)
(e.g., the first stroke and the second stroke are determined to belong to different
characters based at least in part on: the fact that the second stroke was detected after the
first stroke, the time between the end of the first stroke and the beginning of the second
stroke, and/or the acceleration/speed/direction of the contact making the first stroke and
the acceleration/speed/direction of the contact making the second stroke, etc. For
example, a "\" stroke is optionally determined as belonging to a preceding "K", and a
subsequent "/" stroke is optionally determined as belonging to a subsequent "M" because
the first stroke is inputted from top-left to bottom-right, and the second stroke is inputted
from bottom-left to top-right).
[00148]           In some embodiments, the first stroke is spatially segregated from the
second stroke (e.g., the first stroke was detected in a first region of the touch-sensitive
surface, and the second stroke was detected in a second region of the touch-sensitive
surface that does not overlay with the first region), and the first stroke and the second
stroke are determined as belonging to the same character based at least in part on the
temporal information (754) (e.g., the first stroke and the second stroke are determined to
belong to the same character based at least in part on: the fact that the second stroke was
detected after the first stroke, the time between the end of the first stroke and the
beginning of the second stroke, and/or the acceleration/speed/direction of the contact

making the first stroke and the acceleration/speed/direction of the contact making the
second stroke, etc. For example, a "\" stroke and a subsequent "/" stroke are optionally
determined as belonging to a single "X" because the first stroke is inputted from top-left
to bottom-right, and the second stroke is inputted from top-right to bottom-left).
[00149]         It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in
Figs. 7A-7D have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate that
the described order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of
ordinary skill in the art would recognize various ways to reorder the operations described
herein. Additionally, it should be noted that details of other processes described herein
with respect to other methods described herein (e.g., methods 900 and 1100) are also
applicable in an analogous manner to method 700 described above with respect to Figs.
7A-7D. For example, the touch-sensitive surface described above with reference to
method 700 optionally has one or more of the characteristics of the touch-sensitive
surfaces described herein with reference to other methods described herein (e.g., methods
900 and 1100). For brevity, these details are not repeated here.
[00150]         The operations in the information processing methods described above are,
optionally, implemented by running one or more functional modules in an information
processing apparatus such as general purpose processors (e.g., as described above with
respect to Figs. 1A, 3 and 5) or application specific chips.
[00151]         The operations described above with reference to Figs. 7A-7D are,
optionally, implemented by components depicted in Figs. lA-lB. For example, receiving
operation 702, and determination operations 710, 712 and 714 are, optionally,
implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and event handler 190. Event
monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive display 112, and
event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to application 136-1. A
respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event information to
respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a first location
on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as
selection of an object on a user interface. When a respective predefined event or sub
event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the
detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler 190 optionally utilizes or calls data
updater 176 or object updater 177 to update the application internal state 192. In some
                                             -45-

embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a respective GUI updater 178 to update what is
displayed by the application. Similarly, it would be clear to a person having ordinary
skill in the art how other processes can be implemented based on the components
depicted in Figs. lA-lB.
                                  Handwritten Input Feedback
[00152]          When a user is providing handwritten input to a device, it can be beneficial
for the device to provide some feedback to the user about the user's input and the device's
interpretation of that input. This can give the user opportunity to adjust its input if needed
to make it more likely that the desired input will be recognized by the device. The
embodiments described below provide ways that a device optionally presents such
feedback for handwritten input. Enhancing interactions with a device reduces the amount
of time needed by a person to perform operations, and thus reduces the power usage of
the device and increases battery life for battery-powered devices.
[00153]           Figs. 8A-8E illustrate exemplary ways in which feedback for handwritten
input is presented in a user interface in accordance with some embodiments of the
disclosure. The embodiments in these figures are used to illustrate the processes
described below, including the processes described with reference to Figs. 9A-9D.
[00154]           Fig. 8A illustrates an exemplary handwritten input and resulting user
interface presented in accordance with some embodiments. A user interface is optionally
presented on display 450, and an input is optionally detected on touch-sensitive surface
451. Display 450 optionally corresponds to display 514 in Fig. 5, and touch-sensitive
surface 451 optionally corresponds to a touch-sensitive surface on remote 510 in Fig. 5.
The user interface optionally includes a region into which text is to be inputted, such as
text entry field 802. The user interface also optionally includes gesture display region
804, which is optionally a region for displaying gesture feedback corresponding to an
input detected on touch-sensitive surface 451.
[00155]           Handwritten input is optionally detected on touch-sensitive surface 451.
The handwritten input optionally includes movement of contact 801, as illustrated in Fig.
8A. Gesture display region 804 optionally displays a representation 806 of the
handwritten input (e.g., a representation of the movement of contact 801). In some
embodiments, representation 806 of the handwritten input optionally includes a contact
                                              -46-

WO 2015/200228                                                             PCT/US2015/037030
position indicator (e.g., a glowing dot) representing a current location of contact 801 on
touch-sensitive surface 451, and a trail representing one or more past locations of contact
801 on touch-sensitive surface 451. In some embodiments, a visual emphasis of a
respective point in the trail varies depending on the amount of time that has elapsed since
the contact position indicator was at the respective point in the trail (e.g., the trail fades
out over time. In some embodiments, the glowing dot represents contact 801, and as
contact 801 moves, it leaves a trail representing how contact 801 has moved, in which
points on the trail start to fade as a function of time since the points were created).
[00156]          In some embodiments, and as illustrated in Fig. 8A, gesture display region
804 is displayed at a location in which character entry is to performed (e.g., in-line with
text entry field 802).
[00157]          In addition to gesture display region, in some embodiments, a candidate
character 808 is displayed concurrently with representation 806 of the movement of
contact 801. The candidate character 808 is optionally a character that corresponds to the
movement of contact 801 (e.g., the most likely candidate that corresponds to the
movement of the contact). As shown in Fig. 8A, in some embodiments, the most likely
candidate character is determined to be a "C", and the "C" is displayed concurrently with
representation 806 of the movement of contact 801. As further input is detected on touch
sensitive surface 451, the user interface displayed on display 450 is optionally updated
accordingly.
[00158]          Fig. 8B illustrates an updating of a user interface in accordance with
additional input detected on a touch-sensitive surface. In some embodiments, various
aspects of the user interface displayed on display 450 are optionally continually updated
as input is detected on touch-sensitive surface 451. In Fig. 8B, additional movement of
contact 801 has been detected on touch-sensitive surface 451 with respect to that in Fig.
8A. In particular, the movement of contact 801 has continued in a circular fashion to
approach the shape of a circle (e.g., the shape of an "0"). As a result, representation 806
of the movement of contact 801 has been updated to reflect this additional movement, and
the candidate character 808 determined to correspond to the movement of contact 801 has
been updated to reflect that the movement of contact 801 now most likely corresponds to
an "0" rather than a "C", as was the case in Fig. 8A.

[00159]           In some embodiments, as characters are entered into text entry field 802,
gesture display region 804 shifts to the next area in text entry field 802 into which
characters are to be inputted.
[00160]           Fig. 8C illustrates an exemplary shifting of the gesture display region after
a candidate character has been determined to be a final character. Candidate character
"0" 808 has been determined to be a final character, and has been entered into text entry
field 802 as final character 809. This optionally involves a determination that the input
detected on touch-sensitive surface 451 in Fig. 8B corresponds to candidate character "0"
808, and that any additional input detected on touch-sensitive surface 451 would and/or
does correspond to a different character, a determination that candidate character "0" 808
is the final character, and entering it in text entry field 802. In some embodiments, this
occurs in response to input not being detected on touch-sensitive surface 451 for a
threshold amount of time (.1, .5, or 1 second, for example); in some embodiments, this
occurs in response to receiving an indication of an input detected on touch-sensitive
surface 451 indicating that candidate character "0" 808 is to be inputted in the user
interface; in some embodiments, this occurs in response to a determination by the device
that it is unlikely that further input on touch-sensitive surface 451 corresponds to the same
character as input already received on touch-sensitive surface 451.
[00161]           After final character 809 has been entered in text entry field 802, gesture
display region 804 is optionally moved to the next location in the user interface (e.g., the
next location in text entry field 802) at which another character is to be entered, as
illustrated in Fig. 8C.
[00162]           After gesture display region 804 has been moved, as described, character
entry is optionally continued in a manner similar to as described with reference to Figs.
8A-8C.
[00163]           Fig. 8D illustrates an exemplary continuation of handwritten input
recognition and user interface feedback provided after the movement of gesture display
region 804 has completed. As illustrated in Fig. 8D, handwritten input recognition and
user interface feedback optionally continues as described above with references to Figs.
8A-8C.

[00164]         Fig. 8E illustrates an exemplary handwritten input and resulting user
interface presented in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, the
candidate character 808 is displayed as an overlay on representation 806 of the movement
of contact 801 such that a shape and a position of the candidate character 808 is similar to
a shape and a position of representation 806 of the movement of contact 801. In some
embodiments, the device attempts to match the trail left by the glowing dot, for example,
as much as possible to the candidate character so that the lines/strokes of the candidate
character align with the lines/strokes of the trail). As shown in Fig. 8E, the "C" candidate
character 808 is overlaid on the representation 806 of the movement of contact 801, and a
shape and a position of the candidate character 808 is similar to a shape and a position of
representation 806 of the movement of contact 801.
[00165]         Figs. 9A-9D are flow diagrams illustrating a method 900 of presenting
feedback for handwritten input in accordance with some embodiments. The method 900
is optionally performed at an electronic device such as device 500 as described above
with reference to Fig. 5, including a set top box or other user interface generating device
that is in communication with a remote control and a display device. Some operations in
method 900 are, optionally, combined and/or the order of some operations is, optionally,
changed.
[00166]         As described below, the method 900 provides ways in which a device
optionally presents feedback for handwritten input in a user interface. The method
reduces the cognitive burden on a user when interacting with a user interface on the
device, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated
electronic devices, increasing the efficiency of the user's interaction with the user
interface conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.
[00167]         In some embodiments, an electronic device (e.g., a set top box or other
user interface generating device that is in communication with a remote control and a
display device, such as device 500 in Fig. 5) with one or more processors and memory
generates (902) a user interface for display on a display device (e.g., a television or other
display device), wherein the user interface includes a gesture display region (e.g., a region
for displaying gesture feedback corresponding to an input received on a touch-sensitive
surface of a device, such as gesture display region 804 in Fig. 8A). In some
embodiments, the user interface includes a text entry field (e.g., search field, web address
                                              -49-

WO 2015/200228                                                              PCT/US2015/037030
field, username/password field, such as text entry field 802 in Fig. 8A), and the gesture
display region is displayed in-line with the text entry field (904) (e.g., the representation
of the movement of the contact is displayed in or adjacent to an area of the text entry field
in which the next text/character is to be inputted).
[00168]          In some embodiments, while the user interface is displayed on the display
device, the electronic device receives (906) an indication of a first input that includes
movement of a contact (e.g., a finger contact or stylus contact, such as contact 801 in Fig.
8A) detected on a touch-sensitive surface of a device (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface of a
remote control or a portable multifunction device with a touchscreen display, such as
touch-sensitive surface 451 in Fig. 8A).
[00169]          In some embodiments, after receiving the indication of the first input (908)
(in some embodiments, this is while receiving the indication of the first input. In some
embodiments, this is in response to receiving the first input), the electronic device
displays (910) a representation of the movement of the contact in the gesture display
region (e.g., displays the representation of the movement of the contact in the gesture
display region in the user interface, such as representation 806 of the movement of
contact 801 in Fig. 8A). In some embodiments, the representation of the movement of the
contact comprises (912) a contact position indicator (e.g., a glowing dot) representing a
current location of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface of the device (914), and a
trail representing one or more past locations of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface
of the device, wherein a visual emphasis of a respective point in the trail varies depending
on the amount of time that has elapsed since the contact position indicator was at the
respective point in the trail (916) (e.g., the trail fades out over time. In some
embodiments, the glowing dot represents the contact, and as the contact moves, it leaves a
trail representing how the contact has moved, in which points on the trail start to fade as a
function of time since the points were created). In some embodiments, the representation
of the movement of the contact is displayed in a region of a first text entry field that is
visually distinguished from other regions of the first text entry field (918) (e.g., the
representation of the movement of the contact is displayed in a region of the text entry
field-for example, the region of the text entry field into which the current text is to
inputted-having a slightly different shade than the rest of the text entry field. In some
embodiments, the representation of the movement of the contact has an outline around it

WO 2015/200228                                                               PCT/US2015/037030
to differentiate it from the rest of the text entry field, such as illustrated by gesture display
region 806 in Fig. 8A. The representation of the movement of the contact optionally has
any visual feature that differentiates it, visually, from the text entry field generally).
[00170]          In some embodiments, after receiving the indication of the first input
(908), the electronic device determines (920) a first candidate character that corresponds
to the movement of the contact (e.g., determine that "C" is the most likely candidate that
corresponds to the movement of the contact). In some embodiments, determining the first
candidate character comprises determining the first candidate character from a plurality of
candidate characters that correspond to the movement of the contact (922) (e.g., the
movement of the contact could correspond to a plurality of candidate characters, one of
which-the first candidate character-the device determines to be the best and selects to
be displayed in the gesture display region).
[00171]          In some embodiments, after receiving the indication of the first input
(908), the electronic device concurrently displays (924) the first candidate character with
the representation of the movement of the contact in the gesture display region (e.g.,
displays both the first candidate character (e.g., "C") and the representation of the
movement of the contact, such as representation 806 of the movement of contact 801 and
candidate character 808 in Fig. 8A). In some embodiments, displaying the first candidate
character in the gesture display region comprises displaying the first candidate character
in the gesture display region until a second candidate character is determined to be a most
likely candidate character (926) (e.g., the first candidate character is optionally currently
the most likely candidate character, but will optionally be replaced in the gesture display
region if another character becomes the most likely candidate character based on
additional movement of the contact). In some embodiments, displaying the first
candidate character in the gesture display region comprises displaying the first candidate
character overlaid on the representation of the movement of the contact in the gesture
display region (928). In some embodiments, in the user interface, the first candidate
character is overlaid on the representation of the movement of the contact such that a
shape and a position of the first candidate character is similar to a shape and a position of
the representation of the movement of the contact (930) (e.g., attempt to match the trail
left by the glowing dot, for example, as much as possible to the first candidate character
so that the lines/strokes of the first candidate character align with the lines/strokes of the
                                               -51-

WO 2015/200228                                                               PCT/US2015/037030
trail). In some embodiments, the candidate character is displayed in a predefined
location, such as a center of the gesture display region at a predefined size.
[00172]          In some embodiments, the electronic device detects (932) additional
movement of the contact of the first input, determines (934) that the second candidate
character is the most likely candidate character (e.g., determines that a new character is
now the most likely candidate character), ceases (936) display of the first candidate
character in the gesture display region, and concurrently displays (938) the second
candidate character with the representation of the movement of the contact in the gesture
display region (e.g., as illustrated in Figs. 8A-8B).
[00173]          In some embodiments, the gesture display region is displayed at a first
location in the user interface at which the first candidate character is to be entered (940)
(e.g., the gesture display region is displayed at a location where text/characters are to be
entered in the user interface; for example, text entry field 802 in Fig. 8A), and the
electronic device, in response to a determination that the first candidate character is a
final character, enters (942) the first candidate character in the first location in the user
interface (e.g., upon determining that the first input corresponds to the first candidate
character, and that any additional input would/does correspond to a different character,
the electronic device optionally determines that the first candidate character is the final
character, and enter it in, for example, a text entry field (e.g., as illustrated in Fig. 8C). In
some embodiments, this occurs in response to input not being detected for a threshold
amount of time (.1, .5, or 1 second, for example); in some embodiments, this occurs in
response to receiving an indication of an input indicating that the first candidate character
is to be inputted in the user interface; in some embodiments, this occurs in response to a
determination by the device that it is unlikely that further input on the touch-sensitive
surface will correspond to the same character as input already received on the touch
sensitive surface). In some embodiments, entering the first candidate in the first location
is in response to detecting liftoff of the contact of the first input (944) (in some
embodiments, this occurs in response to detecting liftoff of the contact and no further
input for longer than a threshold amount of time (e.g., .1, .5 or 1 second)).
[00174]          In some embodiments, the electronic device, after entering the first
candidate character in the first location, moves (946) the gesture display region to a
second location in the user interface at which a second candidate character is to be
                                               -52-

entered (e.g., moves the gesture display region from character entry location to character
entry location in the user interface as characters are entered at the respective locations,
such as illustrated in Fig. 8C).
[00175]          In some embodiments, the electronic device receives (948) an indication of
further movement of the contact, and, in accordance with a determination that movement
of the contact, including the further movement of the contact, corresponds to a second
candidate character, updates (950) the user interface to (e.g., a determination that the
second candidate character is the best candidate character from a plurality of candidate
characters that correspond to the movement of the contact and the further movement of
the contact. For example, the further movement of the contact has changed the best guess
of what character the movement of the contact corresponds to): cease to display the first
candidate character (952), and display the second candidate character overlaid on the
representation of the movement of the contact (954) (e.g., as the contact continues to
move, the electronic device optionally uses the additional movement information to
update the best candidate character that is displayed overlaid on the representation of the
movement of the contact). In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination
that the first candidate character continues to be the best candidate character from a
plurality of candidate characters that correspond to the movement of the contact and the
further movement of the contact (e.g., the further movement of the contact has not
changed the best guess of what character the movement of the contact corresponds to),
the user interface continues to display the first candidate character overlaid on the
representation of the movement of the contact.
[00176]          In some embodiments, the visually distinguished region of the first text
entry field is a current character input region of the first text entry field into which a
current character is to be inputted (956), and the electronic device receives (958) a request
to switch to inputting characters in a second character input region of the first text entry
field. In some embodiments, in response to receiving the request, the electronic device
updates (960) the user interface to shift the visually distinguished region to the second
character input region of the first text entry field (e.g., shift the visually distinguished
region to the next position in the text entry field into which text/a character is to be
inputted, such as illustrated in Fig. 8C).

[00177]          In some embodiments, before updating the user interface to shift the
visually distinguished region to the second character input region (962), the electronic
device determines (964) a final character corresponding to the movement of the contact
(e.g., determines the final character to which movement of the contact corresponds. In
some embodiments, this occurs in response to input not being detected for a threshold
amount of time (.1, .5, or 1 second, for example); in some embodiments, this occurs in
response to receiving an indication of an input indicating that a current candidate
character is to be inputted in the user interface; in some embodiments, this occurs in
response to a determination by the device that it is unlikely that further input on the
touch-sensitive surface will correspond to the same character as input already received on
the touch-sensitive surface). In some embodiments, the electronic device inputs (966) the
final character into the current character region of the text entry field (e.g., enters the final
character into the current character entry position in the text entry field, such as final
character 809 in Fig. 8C).
[00178]          It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in
Figs. 9A-9D have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate that
the described order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of
ordinary skill in the art would recognize various ways to reorder the operations described
herein. Additionally, it should be noted that details of other processes described herein
with respect to other methods described herein (e.g., methods 700 and 1100) are also
applicable in an analogous manner to method 900 described above with respect to Figs.
9A-9D. For example, the user interface, display device and inputs described above with
reference to method 900 optionally have one or more of the characteristics of the user
interfaces, display devices and inputs described herein with reference to other methods
described herein (e.g., methods 700 and 1100). For brevity, these details are not repeated
here.
[00179]          The operations in the information processing methods described above are,
optionally, implemented by running one or more functional modules in an information
processing apparatus such as general purpose processors (e.g., as described above with
respect to Figs. 1A, 3 and 5) or application specific chips.
[00180]          The operations described above with reference to Figs. 9A-9D are,
optionally, implemented by components depicted in Figs. lA-lB. For example,

generation operation 902, receiving operation 906, and displaying operation 910 are,
optionally, implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and event handler
 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive display
 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to application 136-1.
A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event information to
respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a first location
on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as
selection of an object on a user interface. When a respective predefined event or sub
event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the
detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler 190 optionally utilizes or calls data
updater 176 or object updater 177 to update the application internal state 192. In some
embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a respective GUI updater 178 to update what is
displayed by the application. Similarly, it would be clear to a person having ordinary
skill in the art how other processes can be implemented based on the components
depicted in Figs. lA-lB.
                              Character Recognition Correction
[00181]          When providing handwritten input to a device, a user may wish to correct
a previously inputted character in a simple manner. Thus, it can be beneficial for a device
to provide a robust handwritten input correction user interface such that interaction with
the device is enhanced. The embodiments described below provide ways to present such
a correction user interface. Enhancing interactions with a device reduces the amount of
time needed by a user to perform operations, and thus reduces the power usage of the
device and increases battery life for battery-powered devices.
[00182]           Figs. 10A-10K illustrate exemplary ways in which an electronic device
presents a handwritten input correction user interface in accordance with some
embodiments of the disclosure. The embodiments in these figures are used to illustrate
the processes described below, including the processes described with reference to Figs.
 11A-liD.
[00183]           Fig. 1OA illustrates an exemplary user interface into which characters are
being inputted. Display 450 optionally displays a user interface that includes a candidate
character region (e.g., a region in the user interface into which one or more characters are
                                              -55-

inputted), such as text entry field 1002. Display 450 optionally corresponds to display
514 in Fig. 5. A "T" and an "a" have optionally already been inputted into text entry field
802. Indicator 1004 optionally indicates the next position into which a character, the
handwritten input corresponding to which, will be inputted in text entry field 802.
Indicator 1004 is included for ease of description, but need not actually be displayed in
the user interface displayed on display 450.
[00184]         Input is optionally being detected on touch-sensitive surface 451. Touch
sensitive surface 451 optionally corresponds to a touch-sensitive surface on remote 510 in
Fig. 5. The input detected on touch-sensitive surface 451 optionally includes movement
of contact 1001, as illustrated.
[00185]         The device optionally identifies a character that corresponds to the
movement of contact 1001 to input that character into text entry field 802.
[00186]         Fig. 1OB illustrates recognition and inputting of a candidate character that
corresponds to input detected on a touch-sensitive surface. As shown in Fig. 10B, in
some embodiments, the device has identified a "p" as corresponding to the movement of
contact 1001 detected on touch-sensitive surface 451, and has inputted and displayed
candidate character "p" 1006 at location 1004 in text entry field 1002.
[00187]         In some circumstances, a user wishes to change or correct the inputting of
candidate character "p" 1006 in text entry field 1002 in order to select a different
character to be inputted in text entry field 1002 instead.
[00188]         Fig. 1OC illustrates part of an exemplary candidate character correction in
accordance with some embodiments. As discussed above, a "p" was identified and
inputted into text entry field 1002. However, in some circumstances, a user wishes to
change the "p" that was inputted into text entry field 1002 to instead input a different
character. In order to initiate such a change, in some embodiments, the device receives a
request to delete the "p" character in text entry field 1002. As shown in Fig. 1OC, in
some embodiments, this request is a right-to-left swipe detected on touch-sensitive
surface 451 as defined by the movement of contact 1003. It is understood that any
request to delete a candidate character is within the scope of the disclosure, including
detection of selection of a delete button in the user interface, on an input device, or
otherwise.

[00189]           Fig. 1OD illustrates deletion of a candidate character and displaying of
other candidate characters in response to receiving a request to delete a candidate
character. In response to the movement of contact 1003 detected on touch-sensitive
surface 451, the device optionally deletes candidate character "p" from text entry field
 1002, and displays, in place of candidate character "p", a plurality of other candidate
characters 1008 that correspond to the movement of contact 1001 in Fig. 10A (e.g., the
movement of the contact that resulted in the inputting of candidate character "p" in the
first instance). For example, the plurality of other candidate characters are characters
other than candidate character "p" that correspond to the input that was used to input
candidate character "o" into the candidate character region (e.g., text entry field 1002) in
the first place; or, alternative character matches.
[00190]           As shown in Fig. 1OD, in some embodiments, the plurality of other
candidate characters 1008 include a "P", a "B", an "R" and a "&". In some embodiments,
the plurality of other candidate characters 1008 is displayed in a layout similar to a layout
of touch-sensitive surface 451. For example, the plurality of candidate characters 1008 is
optionally displayed as a 2x2 grid in the user interface, with a first character in the top
left (e.g., character "P"), a second character in the top-right (e.g., character "R"), a third
character in the bottom-right (e.g., character "&"), and a fourth character in the bottom
left (e.g., character "B"). Selection of a respective one of the characters is optionally
accomplished by detecting a tap in the region on touch-sensitive surface 4451 (top-left,
top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left) corresponding to the region in the grid in which the
respective character is displayed. The device optionally detects selection of one of the
plurality of other candidate characters 1008 to input the selected other candidate character
into text entry field 1002, or optionally detects another input on touch-sensitive surface
451 to dismiss the plurality of other candidate characters 1008 from the user interface.
[00191]           Fig. 10E illustrates detection of a selection of one of the plurality of other
candidate characters for entry into text entry field 1002. As shown in Fig. 10E, in some
embodiments, contact 1005 has been detected in the upper-right region of touch-sensitive
surface 451. As a result, character "R" is inputted into text entry field 1002 in place of
plurality of other candidate characters 1008 (and in place of original candidate character
 "p"), as illustrated in Fig. 10E. Others of the plurality of other candidate characters 1008
could have optionally been selected in an analogous manner.

WO 2015/200228                                                              PCT/US2015/037030
[00192]          Instead of selecting one of the plurality of other candidate characters 1008
shown in Fig. 1OD, in some circumstances, a user optionally dismisses the plurality of
other candidate characters 1008.
[00193]          Fig. 1OF illustrates dismissal of the plurality of other candidate characters
displayed in the user interface. A request to dismiss the plurality of other candidate
characters 1008 is optionally detected on touch-sensitive surface 451 while the plurality
of other candidate characters are displayed, such as in Fig. 1OD. As shown in Fig. 1OF, in
some embodiments, this request corresponds to a right-to-left swipe defined by movement
of contact 1007. In some embodiments, the request to dismiss the plurality of other
candidate characters 1008 is more generally a swipe in the same direction as the swipe for
deleting one of the candidate characters (e.g., the right-to-left swipe defined by movement
of contact 1003 in Fig. 1OC to delete candidate character "p").
[00194]          In response to detection of the swipe defined by the movement of contact
1007 detected on touch-sensitive surface, the device optionally ceases to display the
plurality of other candidate characters 1008 displayed in Fig. 1OD, as illustrated in Fig.
10F. Now, as shown in Fig. lOF, in some embodiments, only "T" and "a" remain in text
entry field 1002. In some circumstances, a user optionally deletes candidate character "a"
in text entry field 1002 in the same manner as described with references to Figs. 1OC
1OD.
[00195]          Fig. 1OG illustrates deletion of a second candidate character and displaying
of further candidate characters in response to receiving a request to delete the second
candidate character. Similar to above, detection of movement of contact 1009 on touch
sensitive surface 451 that defines a right-to-left swipe optionally results in deletion of
candidate character "a" from text entry field 1002. As before, after deletion of candidate
character "a" from text entry field 1002, a plurality of candidate characters 1010
corresponding to the input that was used to input candidate character "a" into text entry
field 1002 in the first place are optionally displayed in place of candidate character "a" in
text entry field 1002. Selection and/or dismissal of the plurality of candidate character
1010 are optionally performed as described above with respect to Figs. 1OD-OF. Thus,
the device of the disclosure optionally maintains alternative candidate character matches
for more than one candidate character displayed in the user interface, allowing a user to

sequentially delete the candidate characters and see alternative candidate character
matches for each deleted candidate character.
[00196]          Figs. 1OH-10I illustrate the insertion of a space into the user interface in
accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, in response to a forward
swipe detected on touch-sensitive surface 451, as illustrated by movement of contact
 1011 in Fig. 10H, the electronic device inputs a space into the candidate character region
(e.g., text entry field 1002). Fig. 101 illustrates movement of indicator 1004 by the
electronic device to indicate the insertion of the space into text entry field 1002 in
response to detection of the forward swipe shown in Fig. 10H.
[00197]          Figs. 10J-10K illustrate the display of different candidate characters based
on the type of candidate character region (e.g., text entry field) into which the device is
inputting text. Fig. 10J illustrates an exemplary plurality of other candidate characters
 1012 displayed when text entry field 1002 is, for example, a search field or an otherwise
regular text entry field (e.g., a text entry field into which entry of characters other than
letters is unlikely). In some embodiments, the plurality of other candidate characters
 1012 displayed when text entry field 1002 is a search field are optionally mostly or all
letters. However, in some embodiments, the type of text entry field optionally affects the
device's determination of the candidate characters that are going to be displayed by the
electronic device. Fig. 10K illustrates an exemplary plurality of other candidate
characters 1014 displayed when text entry field 1020 is, for example, an email address
entry field. If text entry field 1020 is an email address entry field, as shown in Fig. 10K,
the likelihood that a "@" character is displayed as a candidate character is optionally
higher than if the text entry field is a search field or an otherwise regular text entry field,
such as text entry field 1002 in Fig. 1OJ. In Fig. 10K, the plurality of other candidate
characters 1012 optionally include the "@" character 1018 in place of the "G" character
 1016 in Fig. 1OJ, for the reasons given above.
[00198]          Figs. 11 A-1 ID are flow diagrams illustrating a method 1100 of presenting
a handwritten input correction user interface in accordance with some embodiments. The
method 1100 is optionally performed at an electronic device such as device 500 as
described above with reference to Fig. 5, including a set top box or other user interface
generating device that is in communication with a remote control and a display device.
                                                -59-

WO 2015/200228                                                            PCT/US2015/037030
Some operations in method 1100 are, optionally, combined and/or the order of some
operations is, optionally, changed.
[00199]          As described below, the method 1100 provides ways in which a device
optionally presents a handwritten input correction user interface. The method reduces the
cognitive burden on a user when interacting with a user interface on the device, thereby
creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated electronic
devices, increasing the efficiency of the user's interaction with the user interface
conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.
[00200]          In some embodiments, an electronic device (e.g., a set top box or other
user interface generating device that is in communication with a remote control and a
display device, such as device 500 in Fig. 5) with one or more processors and memory
generates (1102) a user interface for display on a display device (e.g., a television or other
display device), wherein the user interface includes a candidate character region (1104)
(e.g., a region in the user interface into which one or more characters are inputted; for
example, a text entry field, such as text entry field 1002 in Fig. 10A). In some
embodiments, the candidate character region in the user interface comprises a text entry
field (1106) (e.g., search field, web address field, username/password field, such as text
entry field 1002 in Fig. 10A).
[00201]          In some embodiments, while the user interface is displayed on the display
device, the electronic device receives (1108) an indication of a first input that includes
movement of a contact (e.g., a finger contact or stylus contact, such as contact 1001 in
Fig. 10A) detected on a touch-sensitive surface of a device (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface
of a remote control or a portable multifunction device with a touchscreen display, such as
touch-sensitive surface 451 in Fig. 10A).
[00202]          In some embodiments, in response to detecting the movement of the
contact, the electronic device identifies (1110) a first candidate character that corresponds
to the movement, such as candidate character 1006 in Fig. 10B (e.g., determines that the
movement of the contact corresponds to a "C"), and updates the user interface to include
the first candidate character in the candidate character region (e.g., inputs a "C" in the
candidate character region).

[00203]           In some embodiments, the electronic device receives (1112) a request to
delete the first candidate character (e.g., by detecting selection of a delete button, by
detecting a delete gesture on the touch-sensitive surface, etc., such as detection of
movement of contact 1003 in Fig. 10C).
[00204]           In some embodiments, in response to receiving the request to delete the
first candidate character, the electronic device updates (1114) the user interface by
deleting the first candidate character in the candidate character region (1116), as
illustrated in Fig. 1OC, and displaying a first plurality of other candidate characters that
correspond to the movement of the contact in place of the first candidate character (1118)
(e.g., the first plurality of other candidate characters are characters other than the first
character that correspond to the input that was used to input the first character into the
candidate character region in the first place, such as the plurality of other candidate
characters 1008 in Fig. 1OD; e.g., alternative character matches for the handwriting
input).
[00205]           In some embodiments, a first region of the touch-sensitive surface of the
device (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface of a remote control or a portable multifunction
device with a touchscreen display) is associated with a first candidate character of the first
plurality of other candidate characters, and a second region of the touch-sensitive surface
of the device, different than the first region, is associated with a second candidate
character of the first plurality of other candidate characters (1120) (e.g., in some
embodiments, the relative location of the first region on the touch-sensitive surface to the
second region on the touch-sensitive surface is the same as the relative location of the
first candidate character to the second candidate character in the user interface. That is,
the first plurality of other candidate characters is displayed in a layout similar to a layout
of the touch-sensitive surface of the device, as illustrated in Fig. 1OD).
[00206]           In some embodiments, the electronic device receives (1122) an indication
of a second input (e.g., tap or tap-and-click) detected on the touch-sensitive surface of the
device, and in response to receiving the indication of the second input (1124), in
accordance with a determination that the second input was detected on the first region of
the touch-sensitive surface of the device, inputs (1126) the first candidate character into
the candidate character region (e.g., detection of contact 1005 in Fig. 1OE optionally
results in the electronic device inputting candidate character "R" into text entry field
                                               -61-

WO 2015/200228                                                             PCT/US2015/037030
 1002). In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the second input
was detected on the second region of the touch-sensitive surface of the device, the
electronic device inputs (1128) the second candidate character into the candidate
character region. For example, the plurality of candidate characters is optionally
displayed as a 2x2 grid in the user interface, with a first character in the top-left, a second
character in the top-right, a third character in the bottom-right, and a fourth character in
the bottom-left, as illustrated in Fig. 10C. Selection of a respective one of the characters
is optionally accomplished by tapping in the region on the touch-sensitive surface (top
left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left) corresponding to the region in the grid in which
the respective character is displayed.
[00207]           In some embodiments, the request to delete the first candidate character
comprises a first swipe (e.g., a right-to-left horizontal swipe) detected on the touch
sensitive surface of the device (1130) (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface of a remote control
or a portable multifunction device with a touchscreen display). In some embodiments,
the electronic device receives (1132) an indication of a second swipe (e.g., a right-to-left
horizontal swipe, such as the swipe defined by movement of contact 1007 in Fig. 1OF)
detected on the touch-sensitive surface of the device (in some embodiments, this is any
request to dismiss the first plurality of other candidate characters in the user interface. In
some embodiments, this is another right-to-left horizontal swipe detected on the touch
sensitive surface of the device following detection of the right-to-left horizontal swipe to
delete the first candidate character, or more generally, a swipe in the same direction as the
swipe for deleting the first candidate character). In some embodiments, in response to the
second swipe, the electronic device ceases (1134) display of the first plurality of other
candidate characters in the user interface, as illustrated in Fig. 1OF.
[00208]           In some embodiments, after ceasing display of the first plurality of other
candidate characters in the user interface, the electronic device receives (1136) an
indication of a third swipe (e.g., a right-to-left horizontal swipe, such as the swipe defined
by movement of contact 1009 in Fig. lOG) detected on the touch-sensitive surface of the
device (in some embodiments, this is any request to delete a character in the candidate
character region. In some embodiments, this is another right-to-left horizontal swipe
detected on the touch-sensitive surface of the device following detection of the right-to
left horizontal swipe to dismiss the first plurality of candidate characters, or more

WO 2015/200228                                                             PCT/US2015/037030
generally, a swipe in the same direction as the swipe for dismissing the first plurality of
candidate characters). In some embodiments, in response to the third swipe, the
electronic device updates (1138) the user interface by: deleting a second candidate
character in the candidate character region (1140) (e.g., another character, other than the
first candidate character, that is in the candidate character region, such as candidate
character "a" in Fig. 1OF), and displaying a second plurality of other candidate characters
associated with the second candidate character (e.g., the plurality of candidate characters
 1010 in Fig. 1OG) in place of the second candidate character (1142), such as illustrated in
Fig. 1OG. For example, in the case that the second candidate character was entered using
handwriting recognition, the second plurality of candidate characters are characters,
sometimes other than the second candidate character, that correspond to the input that was
used to input the second candidate character into the candidate character region in the first
place (e.g., alternative character matches for the handwriting input).
[00209]          In some embodiments, the request to delete the first candidate character
comprises a first swipe (e.g., a right-to-left horizontal swipe, or a backward swipe)
detected on the touch-sensitive surface of the device (1144) (e.g., a touch-sensitive
surface of a remote control or a portable multifunction device with a touchscreen display).
In some embodiments, the electronic device receives (1146) an indication of a second
input that corresponds to selection of a respective one of the first plurality of other
candidate characters (e.g., any input detected on the touch-sensitive surface for selecting
the respective candidate character, such as the region-based selection discussed
previously). In some embodiments, in response to the second input, the electronic device
updates (1148) the user interface to include the respective one of the first plurality of
other candidate characters in the candidate character region (e.g., enters the selected
character into the candidate character region in the user interface, such as illustrated in
Fig. 10E).
[00210]          In some embodiments, after updating the user interface to include the
respective one of the first plurality of other candidate characters in the candidate character
region, the electronic device receives (1150) an indication of a second swipe detected on
the touch-sensitive surface of the device (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface of a remote
control or a portable multifunction device with a touchscreen display), the swipe having a
direction opposite the first swipe (e.g., a left-to-right horizontal swipe, or a forward
                                               -63-

WO 2015/200228                                                              PCT/US2015/037030
swipe). In some embodiments, in response to the second swipe, the electronic device
inputs (1152) a space next to the respective one of the first plurality of other candidate
characters in the candidate character region, as illustrated in Figs. 1OH-10J (e.g., a swipe
forward adds a space to the candidate character region, whereas a swipe backward deletes
a character in the candidate character region and presents an alternate character user
interface, as described previously).
[00211]          In some embodiments, while displaying the respective one of the first
plurality of other candidate characters in the candidate character region, the electronic
device receives (1154) an indication of a second swipe detected on the touch-sensitive
surface of the device (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface of a remote control or a portable
multifunction device with a touchscreen display). In some embodiments, in accordance
with a determination that the second swipe comprises a swipe having a same direction as
the first swipe (e.g., the swipe used to delete the first candidate character. In some
embodiments, a right-to-left horizontal swipe, or a backward swipe), the electronic device
updates (1156) the user interface by deleting the respective one of the first plurality of
other candidate characters in the candidate character region. In some embodiments, in
accordance with a determination that the second swipe comprises a swipe and hold, the
swipe having a same direction as the first swipe (e.g., the swipe used to delete the first
candidate character. In some embodiments, a right-to-left horizontal swipe, or a
backward swipe, followed by a holding of the contact at the end of the swipe for longer
than a threshold period (.1, .5 or 1 seconds)), the electronic device updates (1158) the user
interface by deleting the respective one of the first plurality of other candidate characters
in the candidate character region and other candidate characters in the candidate character
region until a release of the hold is detected (e.g., delete characters one by one in the
candidate character region until liftoff of the contact defining the swipe is detected).
[00212]          In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that a type of
the text entry field comprises a first type (e.g., an email address entry field), the electronic
device displays (1160) a first set of candidate characters as the first plurality of other
candidate characters, and in accordance with a determination that the type of the text
entry field comprises a second type (e.g., a number entry field), different from the first
type, the electronic device displays (1162) a second set of candidate characters, different
from the first set of candidate characters, as the first plurality of other candidate

characters. For example, the type of the text entry field optionally affects the electronic
device's determination of the candidate characters that are going to be displayed. If the
text entry field is an email address entry field, for example, the likelihood that a "@"
symbol is displayed as a candidate character is optionally higher than if the text entry
field is a number or regular text entry field, as illustrated in Figs. 1OJ-1OK.
[00213]          It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in
Figs. 11 A-1 ID have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate
that the described order is the only order in which the operations could be performed.
One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize various ways to reorder the operations
described herein. Additionally, it should be noted that details of other processes
described herein with respect to other methods described herein (e.g., methods 700 and
900) are also applicable in an analogous manner to method 1100 described above with
respect to Figs. 11 A- 1 ID. For example, the user interface, display device and touch
sensitive surface described above with reference to method 1100 optionally have one or
more of the characteristics of the user interfaces, display devices and touch-sensitive
surfaces described herein with reference to other methods described herein (e.g., methods
700 and 900). For brevity, these details are not repeated here.
[00214]          The operations in the information processing methods described above are,
optionally, implemented by running one or more functional modules in an information
processing apparatus such as general purpose processors (e.g., as described above with
respect to Figs. 1A, 3 and 5) or application specific chips.
[00215]          The operations described above with reference to Figs. 11 A-1 ID are,
optionally, implemented by components depicted in Figs. lA-lB. For example,
generation operation 1102, receiving operation 1108, identifying operation 1110, and
updating operation 1114 are, optionally, implemented by event sorter 170, event
recognizer 180, and event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a
contact on touch-sensitive display 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the
event information to application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of application
 136-1 compares the event information to respective event definitions 186, and determines
whether a first contact at a first location on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to a
predefined event or sub-event, such as selection of an object on a user interface. When a
respective predefined event or sub-event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an

event handler 190 associated with the detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler
 190 optionally utilizes or calls data updater 176 or object updater 177 to update the
application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a
respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application. Similarly, it
would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be
implemented based on the components depicted in Figs. lA-lB.
[00216]           In accordance with some embodiments, Fig. 12 shows a functional block
diagram of an electronic device 1200 configured in accordance with the principles of the
various described embodiments. The functional blocks of the device are, optionally,
implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software to carry
out the principles of the various described embodiments. It is understood by persons of
skill in the art that the functional blocks described in Fig. 12 are, optionally, combined or
separated into sub-blocks to implement the principles of the various described
embodiments. Therefore, the description herein optionally supports any possible
combination or separation or further definition of the functional blocks described herein.
[00217]           As shown in Fig. 12, an electronic device 1200 optionally includes a
receiving unit 1202 configured to receive inputs, and a processing unit 1204 coupled to
the receiving unit 1202. In some embodiments, the processing unit 1204 includes a
determining unit 1206, a display enabling unit 1208, a selecting unit 1210, and a detecting
unit 1212.
[00218]           In some embodiments, the receiving unit 1202 is configured to receive an
indication of a first input that includes movement of a contact detected on a touch
sensitive surface of a device, wherein the movement of the contact comprises a first
stroke, and the first stroke has a spatial component and a temporal component.
[00219]           In some embodiments, the processing unit 1205 is configured to determine
a first probability that the first stroke corresponds to a first character based on the spatial
component of the first stroke (e.g., with the determining unit 1206), determine a second
probability that the first stroke corresponds to the first character based on the temporal
component of the first stroke (e.g., with the determining unit 1206), and determine an
aggregate probability that the first stroke corresponds to the first character based on the

[00220]          In some embodiments, the determinations of the first, second and
aggregate probabilities are performed (e.g., with the determining unit 1206) while the first
stroke is still being detected. In some embodiments, the determinations of the first,
second and aggregate probabilities are repeated periodically (e.g., with the determining
unit 1206) while the first stroke is still being detected.

while the first stroke is still being detected: determine, at a first time, a first aggregate
probability that the first stroke corresponds to the first character (e.g., with the
determining unit 1206), provide a first character suggestion for display on a display
device based on the first aggregate probability (e.g., with the display enabling unit 1208),
determine, at a second time after the first time, a second aggregate probability that the
first stroke corresponds to the first character (e.g., with the determining unit 1206), and
provide a second character suggestion, different from the first character suggestion, for
display on the display device based on the second aggregate probability (e.g., with the
display enabling unit 1208).
[00222]          In some embodiments, the first input comprises the first stroke detected
during a first time period and a second stroke detected during a second time period, the
second stroke having a spatial component and a temporal component, and the processing
unit 1204 is further configured to: determine a third probability that the first stroke
corresponds to the first character and the second stroke corresponds to a second character
based on the temporal and spatial components of the first and second strokes (e.g., with
the determining unit 1206), determine a fourth probability that a combination of the first
stroke and the second stroke corresponds to a third character based on the temporal and
spatial components of the combination of the first and second strokes (e.g., with the
determining unit 1206), in accordance with a determination that the third probability is
higher than the fourth probability, select the first character and the second character as
inputs (e.g., with the selecting unit 1210), and in accordance with a determination that the
fourth probability is higher than the third probability, select the third character as an input
(e.g., with the selecting unit 1210).

to a first character of the plurality of characters and a second aggregate probability
comprising an aggregate probability that the first stroke corresponds to a second character
of the plurality of characters (e.g., with the determining unit 1206), and select, from the
plurality of characters, a character having the highest aggregate probability as an input
(e.g., with the selecting unit 1210).
[00225]           In some embodiments, the processing unit 1204 is further configured to
detect an end of the first stroke (e.g., with the detecting unit 121), and after detecting the
end of the first stroke, detect at least a portion of a second stroke (e.g., with the detecting
unit 1212), and in response to detecting the portion of the second stroke, determine
whether the first stroke and the second stroke correspond to a single character based on
temporal information about the first stroke and the second stroke (e.g., with the
determining unit 1206). In some embodiments, the second stroke spatially overlaps at
least a portion of the first stroke, and the first stroke and the second stroke are determined
as belonging to different characters based at least in part on the temporal information. In
some embodiments, the first stroke is spatially segregated from the second stroke, and the
first stroke and the second stroke are determined as belonging to the same character based
at least in part on the temporal information.

operation 1110 are, optionally implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180,
and event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch
sensitive display 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to
application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the
event information to respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first
contact at a first location on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event
or sub-event, such as selection of an object on a user interface. When a respective
predefined event or sub-event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler
190 associated with the detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler 190 optionally
utilizes or calls data updater 176 or object updater 177 to update the application internal
state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a respective GUI updater
178 to update what is displayed by the application. Similarly, it would be clear to a
person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be implemented based on
the components depicted in Figs. 1A-1B, Fig. 12, Fig. 13, or Fig. 14.
