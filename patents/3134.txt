   Detailed Description
30 Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system,
   a game controller and a method of operating a gaming
   system which provide for the dynamic formation of the set
   of reel strips used by the gaming system by adding stacks
   of oversized symbols.
35
   General construction of gaming system
                                            10246027_1 (GHMatters) P101045.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 6
    The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
    a first form, a standalone gaming machine is provided
    wherein all or most components required for implementing
    the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
  5
    In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
    wherein some of the components required for implementing
    the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
    and some of the components required for implementing the
10  game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
    For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
    wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
    gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
    such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
15  architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
    executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
    operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
    and/or visible gaming information to the player and
    receive gaming inputs from the player.
20
    However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
    envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
    wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
    and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
25  gaming server are selectively modifiable.      For example,
    the gaming system may operate in standalone gaming machine
    mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode depending
    on the game being played, operating conditions, and so on.
    Other variations will be apparent to persons skilled in
30  the art.
    Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
    core components. At the broadest level, the core
    components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
35  60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
    arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
    the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
                                             10246027_1 (GHMatters) P101045.AU.1 15/05/18

   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
 5 Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
10 enable a player to input game play instructions             (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
15 that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
20 to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:              a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
25 provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory   and generating outputs   (for example on
   the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
30 general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
   integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
   array  (FPGA).
35 A gaming system in the form of a stand lone gaming machine
   10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine 10
   includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
                                             10246027_1 (GHMatters) P101045.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 8
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
 5 game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
10 card.  Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
15 the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
20 module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module that is accessed in response
25 to insertion of the player tracking device.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.         Further
30 artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
35 The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a
   liquid crystal display.   The display 14 may any other
   suitable video display unit, such as an OLED display.                      The
                                            10246027_1 (GHMatters) P101045.AU.1 15/05/18

                               -  9
   top box 26 may also include a display, which may be of the
   same type as the display 14, or of a different type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
 5 a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
10 Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.    Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
15 with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
20 player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
25 for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.           Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
30
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
35 mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
                                             10246027_1 (GHMatters) P101045.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 10
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
 5 player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
   the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
10 that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
   devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
   buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
15 In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
20 database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                    In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module - i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
25 communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
30 103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
35 103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
                                            10246027_1 (GHMatters) P101045.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 11
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
 5 input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
10 network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
15 machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
20
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
25 associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
30 part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
35 management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
                                            10246027_1 (GHMatters) P101045.AU.1 15/05/18

   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.   With this embodiment,
10 the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
15 could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
   client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
20 and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
25 example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
30
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.

   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.  For example, the game
 5 server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
10 may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   Further detail of gaming system
15 The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to specify
   a wager which will be evaluated for this play of the game
   and initiates a play of the game. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that a player's wager can be varied
   from game to game dependent on player selections. In most
20 spinning reel games, it is typical for the player's wager
   to be made up of a selection as to how the game outcome
   will be evaluated by specifying what parts of the game
   outcome will qualify for winning outcomes and a multiplier
   that will apply to each winning outcome. For example, a
25 player's wager may be based on how many lines they play in
   each game - e.g. a minimum of one line up to the maximum
   number of lines allowed by the game  (noting that not all
   permutations of win lines may be available for selection)
   and an amount per line - e.g. one, two or five credits.
30 Winning outcomes on an activated win line may be evaluated
   based on a pay table that specifies the amount awarded for
   a one credit per line wager multiplied by the amount
   wagered per line.
35 Such win lines are typically formed by a combination of
   symbol display positions, one from each reel, the symbol
   display positions being located relative to one another
                                            10246027_1 (GHMatters) P101045.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 14
   such that they form a line.
   In many games, the gaming machine may award winning
   outcomes which are not strictly limited to the lines they
 5 have selected, for example, "scatter" pays are awarded
   independently of a players selection of pay lines.
   Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, the player may selecting a number of reels to
10 play. Games of this type are marketed under the trade name
   "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd and
   are also known as "ways" to win games. The selection of
   the reel means that each displayed symbol of the reel can
   be substituted for a symbol at one or more designated
15 display positions. In other words, all symbols displayed
   at symbol display positions corresponding to a selected
   reel can be used to form symbol combinations with symbols
   displayed at a designated,  symbol display positions of the
   other reels. For example, if there are five reels and
20 three symbol display positions for each reel such that the
   symbol display positions comprise three rows of five
   symbol display positions, the symbols displayed in the
   centre row are used for non-selected reels. As a result,
   the total number of ways to win is determined by
25 multiplying the number of active display positions of each
   reels, the active display positions being all display
   positions of each selected reel and the designated display
   position of the non-selected reels. As a result for five
   reels and fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to
30 win.
   In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
   shown implementing a number of modules based on program
   code and data stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the
35 art will appreciate that one or more of the modules could
   be implemented in some other way, for example by a
   dedicated circuit.
                                             10246027_1 (GHMatters) P101045.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 15
   The outcome generator 622 is arranged to form reel strips
   dynamically during each play of the game by determining an
   arrangement of stacks of symbols to be added to the reel
 5 strips.  That is, contrary to conventional gaming machine
   where reel strips are fixed, the reel strips are formed
   dynamically each time a player places a fresh wager.
   In this respect, symbol data 641 defines base reel strips
10 641A which are comprised of a number of predefined symbols
   to which the arrangement of oversized stacked symbols will
   be added. The base reel strips 641A also define the
   positions at which the stacks of symbols will be inserted.
15 The stack symbol selector 622A of outcome generator 622
   carries out random determinations using values obtained
   from random number generator 621 to determine whether to
   insert stacks of symbols into the base reel strips 641A.
   In an embodiment, selection of the insertion of stacked
20 symbols is constrained so that the stacked symbols do not
   overlap.  In this respect, the stacked symbols do not
   overlap in the sense that they do not have any common reel
   corresponding to the reel strips.    The selection is
   constrained in this manner because in the embodiments,
25 once an oversized symbol is selected to occupy a plurality
   of reels, those reels will spin together under control of
   the display controller 624.    Accordingly, if there are a
   number of overlapping symbols, it is possible that all of
   the reels could spin together which would be undesirable
30 in terms of the variety of outcomes that could be
   generated by the outcome generator with such an
   arrangement.  Configuring the outcome generator to
   constrain the selection of the insertion of stacked
   symbols ensures that reels carrying different oversized
35 symbol spin independently of one another.
   One example of configuring the outcome generator 622 to
                                             10246027_1 (GHMatters) P101045.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 16
   constrain selection of the stacked oversized symbols is
   given herein in relation to an example embodiment where
   there are six reel strips corresponding to respective ones
   of six spinning reels.  In this example, the oversized
 5 symbols are two, three and four symbol positions wide.
   In one example, symbol selection is constrained by the
   stacked symbol selector 622A performing a random
   determination for each of the reels in a defined order.
10 For example from right to left or left to right.                In an
   example where the random determination is conducted left
   to right, the stacked symbol selector 622A first
   determines whether a stacked oversized symbol is to be
   added to the first reel. For example, by obtaining a value
15 from RNG 621 and comparing it to a defined set of values
   for which an oversized symbol is added. In an embodiment,
   if an oversized symbol is to be added, stacked symbol
   selector 622A randomly selects amongst the different
   oversized symbols which include stacked symbols of
20 different sizes.  As is known in the art, weightings can
   be applied in order to control the probability of a
   particular random selection being made.   Assuming that the
   stacked symbol selector determines that the first reel
   should have oversized symbol and that the stacked symbol
25 is a 2x2 symbol display symbol (two symbols high and two
   symbols wide) the selected symbol will be added to the
   base reel strips by the reel strip former 622C to the
   first and second reel strip and stored as formed reel
   strips 641B.  As the second reel strip has had an
30 oversized symbol added to it, the stacked symbol selector
   622A skips to the third reel to conduct a random
   determination using RNG 621 as to whether to add a further
   oversized symbol to the third reel.  In this example, no
   symbol is added for the third reel.  Accordingly, the
35 stacked symbol selector 622A proceeds to the fourth reel.
   At this point, the stacked symbol selector 622A excludes
   all stacked symbols that are four symbols wide from the
                                            10246027_1 (GHMatters) P101045.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 17
   selection because a symbol that is four symbols wide will
   not fit in the remaining three reel strips, each of which
   are one symbol position wide.   The stacked symbol selector
   622A selects a 3x3 oversized symbol and this is added to
 5 the fourth to sixth reels such that the formed reel strips
   641B comprise the first and second reel strips having the
   2x2 symbol added to them, the third reel in the form of
   the base reel strip, and the fourth, fifth and sixth base
   reel strips with the 3x3 oversized symbol added to them.
10
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in other
   embodiments different techniques may be arranged in order
   to constrain the selection.   For example, in one
   embodiment there may be defined a table of possible
15 arrangements of oversized symbols.   In one example, these
   arrangements may define the dimensions of the oversized
   symbols which are to be added to the base reel strips 641A
   and a separate determination may be made to determine from
   amongst symbols capable of filling those positions, which
20 symbol will fill the position.
   In another embodiment, the table defines not only the
   arrangement of oversized symbols amongst the reel strips
   but also the identity of the symbol.   Again, such
25 arrangements may be weighted in order to control the
   probability of particular outcomes.
   Once the reel strips are formed, a symbol selector 622B
   selects symbols from the formed reel strips 641B using
30 random number generator 621. The selected symbols are
   advised to the display controller 624 which causes them to
   be displayed on display 54 at a set of display positions.
   One example of selecting symbols is for the symbol
35 selector 622B to select symbols from the formed reel
   strips 641B corresponding to respective ones of a
   plurality of spinning reels. The formed reel strips 641B
                                             10246027_1 (GHMatters) P101045.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 18
   specify a sequence of symbols for each reel. In an
   embodiment, the symbol selector 622B selects the symbols
   for display by selecting a stopping position in the
   sequence. It is known to use a probability table stored in
 5 memory 64 to vary the odds of a particular stop position
   being selected. Other techniques can be used to control
   the odds of particular outcomes occurring to thereby
   control the return to player of the game. In this respect,
   where reels share an oversized symbol, only a single
10 stopping position is selected (for example, for the left
   most reel). Accordingly, the symbol selector 622B is
   arranged to determine based on the formed reels strips how
   many stopping positions need to be determined.
15 In the embodiment, the display controller 624 controls the
   display of spinning of the reels in a manner such that
   reels that share an oversized symbol are displayed as
   spinning together.
20 Once the selected symbols are displayed, they are
   evaluated in order to determine whether they include any
   winning outcomes. These evaluations are made by outcome
   evaluator 623 based on the pay table 643 which defines the
   winning outcomes and associated awards.
25
   Referring to Figure 7, there is shown a method 700 of an
   embodiment of the invention.   At step 710, the gaming
   system 1 receives a wager 710 via game play mechanism 56
   together with an instruction from the player to initiate
30 play of the game.  At step 720, the outcome generator 622
   forms the reel strips to produced formed reel strips 641B.
   At step 730, the symbol selector 622B selects symbols for
   display from the formed reel strips 641B and at step 740
   the display controller 624 controls the display 54 to
35 display spinning of the reels during which the reels that
   share an oversized symbol spin together. At step 750, the
   outcome evaluator 623 determines whether there is one or
                                             10246027_1 (GHMatters) P101045.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 19
   more winning outcomes based on pay table 643 and at step
   760, the outcome evaluator makes any awards if there is a
   winning outcome.  After an award is made or if there is no
   winning outcome, the game ends 770.
 5
   In other embodiments, the award may be an award of a
   feature game and hence the game will continue to the
   feature game after step 760.
10 In some embodiments, an eligibility criteria may be
   applied by the gaming system in order for the player to be
   eligible for stacks of symbols to be added. For example
   that the player has made a certain sized wager, made an
   ante bet, selected all win lines, played sufficient games,
15 or the player is a member of a loyalty program.
   Typically, a winning outcome will result in some form of
   award being made such as an award of credits. Such an
   award may never actually be physically received by a
20 player. For example, many gaming systems provide a player
   with a double or nothing gamble feature, where the player
   can double or forfeit their credits before commencing
   another play of the game or cashing out. Further, as
   credits are fungible, once credits have been added to the
25 credit meter it is not possible to distinguish between
   credits which exist because the player has input cash or
   the like and credits resulting from an award.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
30 above description of the system. It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
   electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
   executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
35 description certain steps are described as being carried
   out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
   appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
                                            10246027_1 (GHMatters) P101045.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 20
   sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
   programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
   such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
 5 may need to compute several values and compare those
   values.
   Example
10 An "Elvira" themed game is played on a 6x6 reel area with
   60 pay lines. Stacks of oversized symbols or "mega
   symbols" are added on every base game spin. Stacks may be
   2, 3 or 4 symbols wide.  Stacks can be inserted by the
   outcome generator into any of reel strips to dynamically
15 form the reel strips; these reels spin together when spun.
   Also, up to 3 different stacks can be added to different
   reels on each spin.
   For example, a stack of 2x2 "Mummy Elvira" symbols can be
20 added to reels 1 and 2, while a stack of 3x3 "Skull"
   symbols can be added to reels 3, 4 and 5.
   In an example, the base game symbols include:
25 Bonus Scatter symbols:
         *   TV sets with the word Bonus or a Feature logo for
             one of a plurality of features;
         *   Feature Bonus: symbols of each feature appears on
             reel 6 only;
30       e   Bonus features are triggered with Bonus symbols
             on reels 4 & 5, and a Feature symbol on reel 6.
   Elvira Symbols:
         *   3 different images of the character Elvira with
35           different colour schemes: Black    (classic), red
             bustier, and Mummy.
                                            10246027_1 (GHMatters) P101045.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 21
   Mid Symbols -  2 symbols:
         *   Macabre Mobile  (Elvira's customised T-Bird),                     and
             movie reel.
 5 Low Symbols -  5 symbols:
         *   Snake, skull-shaped goblet, grave stone, dagger,
             ring, and tarantula.
   In the example, stacks can be composed of any base game
10 symbol except scatters. Mega symbols are stacked up 36
   symbol display positions high; however the height of the
   symbol art varies by symbol. For example, Wilds are tiled
   lx1, Elvira symbols appear as 2x2, 3x3 or 4x6, whereas the
   low symbols appear as 2x2, 3x3 or 4x3.
15
   In response to a trigger, such as a random trigger, the
   game controller controls the active area 821 of the reels
   so that it "grows" upward and a multiplier appears. In an
   example, an animated Elvira in the top screen reacts as
20 the reels bump into her and sparks go off around her.
   In an example, after a losing spin with a screen filled
   with stacks, the game controller is configured to give the
   appearance that the Elvira character intervenes and
25 switches some of the stacks to Wilds or matching symbols
   for a big win.
   Figure 8 is an example of a screen shot of an embodiment
   of the invention. The game area is divided into an active
30 game area 821 and an inactive game play area 822 which is
   obscured.  The game area corresponds to six spinning reels
   which are displayed in respective ones of six columns of
   symbol display positions 811, 812, 813, 814, 815 and 816.
   In the screen shot 800 of Figure 8, there are six rows of
35 active symbol display positions 821.   In some examples,
   there are symbols that occupy two symbol display positions
   within a single column.   Figure 8 shows an example of the
                                             10246027_1 (GHMatters) P101045.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 22
   addition of a stack 831 of 3x3 oversized symbols which
   have been added to the reel strips corresponding to
   columns 813, 814 and 815.    Figure 8 also shows bet meter
   841, win meter 842 and credit meter 843.

   As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
10  (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
   a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Further different parts of the program code can
   be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
15 appreciate that program code provides a series of
   instructions executable by the processor.
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
20 departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
   embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
   further embodiments.

   wherein a) there are a plurality of sizes of oversized
   symbols and each oversized symbol is at least two symbol
15 display positions wide such that when it is added to the
   reel strips it is added to a plurality of neighbouring
   reel strips whereby the plurality of neighbouring reel
   strips spin together when spun and b) selection of the
   oversized symbols by the game controller is constrained so
20 that if a plurality of stacks of oversized symbols are
   selected, different stacks of oversized symbols amongst
   the plurality of stack do not have an common reel strip so
   that the different stacks of oversized symbols spin
   independently of one another;

   set of dynamically generated reel strips;
        control the display to display the reels strips as
   spinning to stopping positions at which the selected
   symbols are displayed on the display; and
30      make an award if the selected symbols include one or
   more winning outcomes.
