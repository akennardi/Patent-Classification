                               Patents Act 1990
A 100% biodegradable Oxygen Absorber with Anti-microbial properties and its
                        recyclable use as a soil fertilizer
   Patent Description - The patent is described in the following statements

      A 100% biodegradable OxySorbTM Oxygen Absorber with Anti-microbial
                    properties and its recyclable use as a soil fertilizer
                                      Patent Description
For many years oxygen absorbers for food products considered mainly of small packets
containing chiefly iron carbonate, with 1-3 layers of film. The packaging is being sold as an
anti-microbial i.e. fungi and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, oxygen absorber being the
packaging material satchel inside the food packaging.
These types of oxygen absorbers are usually susceptible to co-absorption of moisture and oil
from the food product if the fat/ oil and moisture is not emulsified i.e. in a natural food
product with an oil coating such as a whole-wheat pizza base with oil on its surface. This
would cause the efficacy of the oxygen absorber to be diminished. With the expansion of
consumer preference towards more natural foods containing raw ingredients i.e. whole
wheat pizza bases with olive oil, there is a need for an oxygen absorber that can also be oil
and moisture resistant.
Moreover, consumers are demanding that food companies make their food packaging
degradable or re-usable. An oxygen absorber in accordance with this innovation comprises
of a four-layer film, containing a layer which protects the chemical contents of the absorber
from oil and water, and the chemical contents could be recycled after expiration of the
oxygen absorber. The chemical contents would be selected not to contain heavy metals, and
thus the ingredients being ferrous carbonate, calcium carbonate, activated carbon, salt
(NaCI), trace elements for plant health would be added to the oxygen absorber composition
i.e. boron, manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni). and cobalt (Co) at less
than 10ppm each.
Previous art include the 20<removed-date> innovation patents of WHOLESALE GROUP
INTERNATIONAL PTY LTD [Inventor; Cichello, Simon DR [IP Australia Patent Number:
<removed-apn>]. This innovation replaces the polyethylene film with cellophane film i.e.
cellulose from Eucalypts spp.

There are four pages of claims only

                                      Patent Claim(s)
      A 100% biodegradable Oxygen Absorber with Anti-microbial properties
                           and its recyclable use as a soil fertilizer
1. The standard oxygen absorber sold in the Australian market is sold with 3 or 4 layers of film,
   is not biodegradable. The packaging is being sold as an anti-microbial i.e. fungi and aerobic
   and anaerobic bacteria, oxygen absorber being the packaging material satchel inside the
   food packaging. The oxygen absorber is anti-microbial.
2. This oxygen absorber is 100% biodegradable. Moreover, the standard oxygen absorber (i.e.
   Australian patent application number 40626/95) which has since lapsed in 22/12/2000, it
   was not and has not been sold with the multiple functions /application as an oxygen
   absorber, nor 100% biodegradable, nor oil or moisture proof, nor and then plant fertilizer
   product, beneficial for plant growth and health. Moreover, previous art includes the 2017
   and 2018 innovation patents of WHOLESALE GROUP INTERNATIONAL PTY LTD [Inventor;
   Cichello, Simon DR [IP Australia Patent Number: <removed-apn>]. This innovation replaces the
   polyethylene film with cellophane film i.e. cellulose from Eucalypts spp. in the packaging
   film.
3. With reference to claim 1., micro-organisms include but not limited to pathogenic aerobic
   and anaerobic species and food spoilage organisms Bacillus sp., and mould/ fungi species
   (Rhizopus spp., Mucor spp., Penicillium spp., Eurotium spp., Aspergillus spp. and Monilia
   spp.). Further, yeast spoilage 'chalk dust mould' caused by Pichia butonii.
4. Oxygen concentration inside the food packaging is reduced to 0.1% oxygen (see figure 3 in
   the description section for expired absorber contents; red-rust colour; presence of iron
   oxide) in product description.
5. With reference to claim 3., the anti-microbial properties is a specialised oxygen absorber
   using 3 layers of outer packaging that involves (from outside food contact to within the
   oxygen absorber); cellophane, laminated together and micro-perforated (10pm hole
   diameter; using a heating process of heating the cellophane in a stepwise method to 175 0 C
   or 347'F and then allowing the melted cellophane to adhere to the porous paper and once
   solidified is adhered to the porous paper. See figure 3 in the description section).

6.  In reference to claim 5., the contents of the chemical of the OxySorbTM oxygen absorber
    (figure 1., and 2 in patent description section) are both recyclable and also can be reused
    once the oxygen absorber has expired (figure 3; left photo in patent description section) as a
    soil micronutrient fertilizer for consumers, thus reducing post-consumer food and
    pharmaceutical packaging waste and improving plant growth and food production. the
    standard oxygen absorber (i.e. Australian patent application number 40626/95) did not
    advocate the use as a soil fertilizer, and did not specify the heavy metal concentrations
    within the chemical composition of the oxygen absorbing powder.
7.  In reference to claim 7., as a percentage of the actual satchel, the only part which is not used
    as a soil fertiliser is the cellophane, paper which is biodegradable.
8.  With reference to both claim 1., and 7., the oxygen absorber will be sold and marketed on its
    combined claim as a post-consumer soil fertilizer for nutrient deficient soil (i.e. specific and
    multi-purpose device; both pre, and post-consumer uses) and also biodegradable and can be
    inserted into worm farms.
9.  In reference to claim 9, Australian soils are typically nitrogen and iron deficient. Also the salt
    (Na Cl) is <1% ~30mg which is negligible and would not effect soil salinity or ground water
    salinity when assuming that a 10 litre pot plant (smallest application) would contain at least
    15kg or 1.5e+7 mg of soil. Thus the salt would add 2ppm sodium chloride which has been
    shown to be beneficial for plants as it is a functional plant nutrient (Subbarao et. L.2003).
10. In reference to claim 9., the contents of the absorber would be beneficial for plant growth
    and health, the activated carbon content of the expired oxygen absorber would reduce the
    drought stress of the plant, it by increasing cation/ anion exchange capacity, increase water
    absorption ratio (Ali et. a/. 2017).
11. In reference to claim 9., the contents of the absorber would be beneficial for plant growth
    and health, the calcium carbonate content increases the pH of acidic soil (the lower the pH
    the more acidic the soil and more unavailable plant macro-nutrients. Moreover, soil acidity
    is reduced and alkalinity increased. Increasing soil pH increases the bioavailability of major
    plant nutrients including nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus and thus supports plant
    growth in combination with activated carbon/ biochar (Rehman et. al. 2017).

12. In reference to claim 9., the contents of the absorber would be beneficial for plant growth
    and health, the ferrous carbonate is reduced to ferrous hydroxide when exposed to oxygen
    in air (10% or 0.3g) and air moisture i.e. oxygen absorber is expired. Ferrous hydroxide is also
    beneficial for plant growth. Of all the elements plants derive from the soil, iron is the most
    abundant, total iron concentrations often being around 2.5%. It is ranked fourth in
    abundance after oxygen, silicon and aluminium in the earth's crust. Iron is essential for plant
    growth as it is for human health. Iron is essential for the formation of chlorophyll (the green
    pigment/ colouring found in leaves). The plant selectively decides when it wants to uptake
    iron (restricted uptake, so toxicity is not common in soil pH from 5.5 - 7.5 unless
    waterlogging occurs) (Khabaz-Saberi et. al. 2009) where the iron can become toxic to the
    plant i.e. with potted plants with water trays underneath. The presence of calcium
    carbonate offsets the effects of additional iron to soil thus neutralizing its effect to become
    toxic (usually in soils <pH5). Moreover, iron is usually deficient in potted plants, and the
    intended marketing of the oxygen absorbers use as a plant based fertilizer satchel system.
13. A number of trace elements will be added, i.e. boron, manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn),
    molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni). and cobalt (Co) at less than 10ppm each, so the contents of
    the oxygen absorber will have a dual function to absorber oxygen for anti-microbial effects,
    and then also be a plant micro., and trace element fertiliser for use in potted plants by
    consumers. Moreover, batch testing will ensure the absence of heavy metals toxic for plants
    and human health i.e. if consumer intends to grow edible vegetables, fruits (figure 5 in
    patent description section).
