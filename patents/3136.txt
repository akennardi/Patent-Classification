 FILLED FOOD PRODUCT AND METHOD OF PRODUCING SUCH FOOD
 PRODUCT
 This application is a divisional application of AU2014213597 the entire contents of which
 are incorporated herein by reference.
                                   Field of the Invention
          [0001]     The present invention generally finds application in the field
  of food products and particularly relates to a filled food product, such as
  Italian dumplings known as ravioli, cappelletti, tortelli, panzerotti and the like.
          [0002]     The invention also relates to a method of producing filled
  food products as mentioned above.
                                      Background art
          [0003]     Food products are known in the art, which comprise an
  envelope of pasta enclosing a filling therein.
          [0004]     These products are typical products of Italian gastronomy
  and the filling may be made of several types of ingredients such as, for
  instance, meat, fish, cereals, vegetables, cheese, protein- or fat-based
  substances or the like.
          [0005]     According to their shapes, these filled food products are
  known as ravioli, tortellini, cappelletti, panzerotti, although many other
  shapes exist for filled food products from regional Italian and foreign
  gastronomic traditions.
          [0006]     Generally, the filling is laid on a sheet of dough, which is later
  closed on itself or with another sheet to cover and wrap the filling.
          [0007]      Filled food products are known, which have a filling made of
  predetermined doses of first and second food components in a raw or cooked
  state.
          [0008]     Particularly, the recipes of certain types of filled products
  require the two food components of the filling to be separate and not mix
  together during filling. This will provide filled food products prepared in strict
  compliance with the original recipes, and will allow the consumer to
  appreciate the taste obtained by the combination of the individual tastes of
  each food component in the filling.
          [0009]     One example of these food products is disclosed in EP 475
                                           1

WO 2014/122611                                                  PCT/IB2014/058847
 911, which comprises an envelope made of two distinct pockets or shells
 enclosing differentiated components or ingredients, and thus designed to
 remain separate and not contact each other.
          [0010]  One drawback of these known products is that they are
 actually formed of two ravioli of different tastes, whereby they cannot be
 tasted at the same time, unless they are joined and ingested together.
 Nevertheless, in this case the amount of pasta increases and at least partially
 dilutes the tastes of the individual ingredients, in addition to increasing the
 percentage of carbohydrates relative to proteins.
          [0011]  A further example of food products having multiple fillings is
 disclosed in W02011/117641,         which describes a savory food product
 composed of an envelope or outer tubular body made of pasta dough with
 one or more channels in which different food substances are held. The
 method of making the product, e.g. in the form of a sausage roll, comprises
 coextruding the body made of pasta with a sauce and with minced meat
 disposed in respective concentric or radially staggered channels.
          [0012]  In this product fresh pasta cannot be used for the body, and
 the components of the fillings must undergo a thermal cooking treatment
 before being extruded into their respective channels.
          [0013]  Furthermore, the method only provides cylindrical envelopes
 and fillings, in which the first and second components are disposed in
 respective coaxial or parallel channels. In practice, the product is tasted in
 sliced form, and resembles more a sausage than a pasta product.
                            Disclosure of the invention
          [0014]  The object of the present invention is to overcome the above
 mentioned drawbacks, by providing a filled food product that has a high
 organoleptic value and is relatively cost-effective.
          [0015]  A particular object of the present invention is to provide a
 filled food product that can be covered with any kind of pasta.
          [0016]  A further object of the present invention is to provide a filled
 food product that affords the provision of instant-made food products, while
                                      2

WO 2014/122611                                                    PCT/IB2014/058847
 maintaining strict compliance with the original handicraft methods.
          [0017]     Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a
 filled food product that allows the filling components to be distributed in
 different positions, according to a wide variety of shapes and types of
 products.
          [0018]     These and other objects, as better explained hereafter, are
 fulfilled by a filled food product as defined in claim 1.
          [0019]     With these characteristics, the food product of the invention
 will afford the provision of filled products with fresh pasta envelopes, whose
 filling is composed of multiple food ingredients introduced into the same
 envelope of traditional, home-made form.
          [0020]      In a further aspect, the invention relates to a method of
 producing the food product, as defined in claim 6.
          [0021]     Advantageous embodiments of the invention are defined in
 accordance with the dependent claims.

          [0023]     The accompanying figures show a composite food product
                                         3

WO 2014/122611                                                    PCT/IB2014/058847
 with double filling, generally designated by numeral 1, which is mainly
 designed for preparation of dishes of high gastronomic quality.
         [0024]     Particularly, the food product 1 of the invention may be one
 of the Italian dumplings known as ravioli, panzerotti, tortelli, cappelletti or the
 lile and may be designed to be eaten either raw and cooked.
         [0025]     If the product 1 is intended for cooking, it may be namely
 designed to be either boiled, e.g. in water or broth or baked, cooked in a
 microwave oven or fried in oil.
         [0026]     The composite food product, as best shown in FIGS. 1A and
 1B essentially comprises an envelope 2 made of pasta, which encloses
 therein a filling 3 made of edible food raw materials.
         [0027]     For example, the envelope 2 may be formed from a sheet of
 pasta dough composed of soft-wheat flour, durum-wheat flour, eggs and
 possibly a very small amount of water. The sheet may have a thickness
 ranging from 0,5 to 2,5 mm, and preferably of about 1 mm.
         [0028]     The raw materials that form the filling may be selected from
 the group comprising, for example, meat, fish, eggs, cheese, cold cuts,
 vegetables, cereals, protein- and fat-based substances, flavors and spices,
 possibly added with seasonings, flavors and sauces, even though these
 cannot be easily combined according to traditional recipes.
         [0029]     The pasta envelope 2 may have a predetermined size and
 shape, allowing it to contain the filling 3, according to the particular type of
 food product 1 to be obtained.
         [0030]     According to a peculiar characteristic of the invention, the
 envelope 2 consists of at least one sheet 4 of fresh pasta and the filling 3
 comprises at least one first dose D1 of a first component 5 and at least one
 second dose D2 of a second component 6 other than the first component.
  Particularly, the doses are distinct D1, D2 , while being both enclosed within
 the same envelope 2.
         [0031]     The choice of fresh pasta and its base components shall
 allow the envelope 2 to optimally wrap the outer surface of the filling 3 with
                                        4

WO 2014/122611                                                      PCT/IB2014/058847
 high surface adhesion, for almost perfect liquid tightness, even in boiling
 liquids, as required for cooking with no loss of filling 3. Furthermore, this will
 provide food products 1 with double filling having a characteristic taste, and
 faithfully reproducing the traditional regional gastronomy tastes.
         [0032]    Namely, the envelope 2 may be made up of a lower layer 7
 and an upper layer 8 of fresh pasta, which are in mutually overlapped or
 juxtaposed relationship and are joined together along a substantially
 continuous peripheral edge C having a predetermined shape, in accordance
 with the type of desired product.
         [0033]    Conveniently, once the layers 7, 8 are joined along the
 peripheral edge C, the envelope 2 will be preferably substantially hermetic,
 i.e. substantially liquid-tight or upon boiling, such that it will not break during
 boiling and will not lose the filling 3.
         [0034]     In a first embodiment of the envelope 2, as shown in FIG. 3,
 the layers 7, 8 may be formed from the same sheet 4 of fresh pasta, which is
 folded on itself along a longitudinal line L using a special ploughshare
 shaped blade, not shown and known to the skilled person.
         [0035]    This embodiment is particularly suitable to make products 1
 such as tortelli, cappelletti, panzerotti and the like.
         [0036]    As an alternative to this envelope 2, as shown in FIG. 4, the
 layers 7, 8 may consist of two distinct and separate sheets of fresh pasta 4,
 4' in mutually overlapped relationship. This embodiment is particularly
 suitable to make products such as ravioli and panzerotti.
         [0037]     In a preferred embodiment, the doses D1, D2 may be
 arranged in substantially concentric relationship.
         [0038]     Particularly, the doses D1, D2 may be laid on the lower layer
 7 in concentric arrangement.
         [0039]    Furthermore, the doses D1, D2 may be laid on the lower layer
 7 substantially at the same time, by coextrusion, using a double-tube nozzle
 U, as shown in FIGS. 1A and 3.
         [0040]    Alternatively, the doses       D1, D2 may       be   arranged    in
                                         5

WO 2014/122611                                                     PCT/IB2014/058847
 substantially coplanar relationship.
         [0041]    Particularly, the doses D1, D2 may be laid on the lower layer
 7 at successive times, using single-tube nozzles U', U", although in
 substantially superimposed and substantially concentric positions 7, 8, as
 shown in FIGS. 1B and 4.
         [0042]    Once the doses D1, D2 have been laid on the lower layer 7, a
 portion of the sheet 4 may be folded thereon along the line L, or a second
 sheet 4' may be laid thereon, to form the upper layer 8 and define a
 semifinished product 1'.
         [0043]    Finally, the semifinished product 1' may be cut to size using a
 forming and cutting tool P, such that the layers 7, 8 will be joined along a
 peripheral edge C and cut thereat to form a finished product 1.
         [0044]    Thus, the finished product will be closed in perfectly liquid
 tight fashion, at its peripheral edge C.
         [0045]    Preferably, the doses D1, D2           may have their respective
 components 5, 6 ranging from 5% to 95%, preferably from 10% to 90% by
 weight, based on the total weight of the filling 3.
         [0046]      In a further aspect, the invention relates to a method of
 making food products.
         [0047]    Particularly, the method comprises preparing an envelope 2
 made of fresh pasta dough and introducing a filling 3 made of edible raw
 materials 5, 6 therein.
         [0048]    In a preferred embodiment, the method comprises a first step
 a) in which a lower layer of fresh pasta 7 is prepared.
         [0049]    In the next step b), a first filling component 5 and at least one
 second filling component 6, other than the first component 5, are prepared.
         [0050]    In the following step c), a first dose D1 of the first component
 5 and a second dose D2 of the second component 6 are laid on the lower
 layer 7.
         [0051]    Conveniently, the method comprises a step d) in which an
 upper layer 8 of fresh pasta is prepared and laid over the lower layer 7 to
                                       6

WO 2014/122611                                                    PCT/IB2014/058847
 cover the doses D1, D2 .
         [0052]     In the next step e), the lower layer 7 and the upper layer 8
 are joined along a substantially continuous peripheral edge C, whose shape
 matches the shape of the finished product 1 to form a filled semifinished
 product 1'.
         [0053]     In step f), the filled semifinished product 1' is cut along the
 edge C to form the finished food product 1.
         [0054]     Particularly, the     semifinished  product  1' may be       cut
 proximate to the peripheral edge C to obtain a shape of the finished product
 1 that is slightly different from that of the edge itself.
         [0055]     Conveniently, in step c), the doses are laid on the lower layer
 7 at the same time, as shown in FIG. 3, or at successive times, as shown in
 FIG. 4.
         [0056]     Conveniently, the first       component  5   and the    second
 component 6 may be heated to a predetermined temperature Tr substantially
 at the same time as they are laid on the lower layer 7.
         [0057]     The first dose D1 and the second dose D2, as best shown in
 FIG. 3, may be substantially concentric and laid by simultaneous coextrusion
 of the first component 5 and the second component 6.
         [0058]     Alternatively, the first dose and the second dose, as best
 shown in FIG. 3, may be substantially concentric and laid by coextruding one
 of the first component 5 and second component 6 later than the other of the
 second component 6 or the first component 5.
         [0059]     Conveniently, as best shown in FIG. 3, the lower layer 7 and
 the upper layer 8 may be obtained by folding a single sheet 4 of fresh pasta
 on itself.
         [0060]     Alternatively, as best shown in FIG. 4, the lower layer 7 and
 the upper layer 8 may be obtained from two distinct sheets 4, 4' of fresh
 pasta.
         [0061]     The two sheets 4, 4' may be in at least partially overlapped
 relationship. Particularly, the filling 3 may be laid on a sheet 4 of fresh pasta,
                                         7

WO 2014/122611                                                  PCT/IB2014/058847
 whereas the other sheet 4' of fresh pasta may be laid at least partially over
 the first sheet 4 and totally over the filling 3.
         [0062]    Particularly, single-sheet food products 1 are made by
 forming the lower layer 7 and the upper layer 8 by folding a single sheet of
 fresh pasta 4 on itself.
         [0063]    Alternatively, double-sheet food products 1 are made by
 forming the lower layer 7 and the upper layer 8 by laying two distinct sheets
 of fresh pasta 4, 4' in overlapped relationship.
         [0064]    In a continuous process, the lower layer 8 and the upper
 layer 9 are both in the form of strips 10, 11, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, and
 are fed in a substantially longitudinal direction L. Each of the strips 10, 11 is
 fed in the direction L by a moving conveyor surface, such as a closed-loop
 belt conveyor N.
         [0065]    Conveniently, as shown in FIG. 3, the doses D1, D2 may be
 laid by simultaneous coextrusion of the first component 5 and the second
 component 6 on one of the strips 10 in predetermined positions along the
 longitudinal extent thereof, and may be later covered by the other strip 11.
         [0066]    Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 4, a dose D1 may be laid on
 one of the strips 10 in a predetermined position and the other dose D2 is laid
 above the dose D, in a substantially concentric position.
         [0067]    The latter dose may be laid later than the dose D1 laid on the
 strip 10.
         [0068]    The overlapped doses D1, D2, as shown in FIG. 4, may be
 later covered by the other strip 11.
         [0069]    The above disclosure clearly shows that the composite food
 product with double filling and the method of the invention fulfill the intended
 objects and particularly meet the requirement of providing a filled food
 product comprising at least one sheet of fresh pasta and having a high
 organoleptic value.
         [0070]    The filled food product and method of the invention are
 susceptible to a number of changes or variants, within the inventive concept
