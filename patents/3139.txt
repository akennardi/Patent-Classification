Augmented Reality Wheel Finder - Description
Vehicle Logic Pty Ltd (ABN: 14 156 160 986) is building an Augmented Reality Wheel Finder.
This application will be used to allow users (vehicle owners) to search & view aftermarket alloy
wheels on their own vehicle via Augmented Reality.
Vehicle Logic currently supply interactive wheel finders to the Australian wheel & tyre industry and
will be using our existing vehicle, wheel & tyre databse along with newly available AR technology to
create the ARWheelFinder.
The software will be available via a downloadable app for smart phones & tablets.
The user will open the app, select their car from our vehicle database then stand 5m away from the
vehicle. When the phone or tablet is held up & the vehicle is visible within the screen, the AR
technology will detect the tyre/wheel & superimpose the available wheel styles via AR technology.
