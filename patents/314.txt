                                    GOVERNMENT RIGHTS
[0002] This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. A1069350, awarded
by the National Institutes of Health; Grant No. HDTRAl-09-1-0001 awarded by the United
States Department of Defense, Defense Threat Reduction Agency. The Government has certain

                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0003] This invention relates to the effective delivery of RNA and DNA molecules into cells by
use of novel nanocapsules. Specifically, this invention relates to a novel DNA cassette and
siRNA nanocapsule technology wherein DNA molecules or siRNA are encapsulated within a
small polymer nanocapsule to facilitate delivery to cells.
                                         BACKGROUND
[0004] RNA interference is is a powerful tool to target and silence specific gene expression.
The term "RNA interference" (RNAi) was coined after the discovery that injection of double
stranded RNA (dsRNA) into C. elegans leads to specific silencing of genes that are highly
homologous in sequence to the delivered dsRNA (Fire et al., 1998). RNAi is closely linked to the
post-transcriptional gene-silencing (PTGS) mechanism of co-suppression in plants and quelling
in fungi (Catalanotto et al., 2000; Cogoni and Macino, 1999; Dalmay et al., 2000, Ketting and
Plasterk, 2000; Mourrain et al., 2000; Smardon et al., 2000).
                                                  1

    WO 2013/138783                                                               PCT/US2013/032615
[0005] RNAi was discovered when researchers were attempting to use antisense RNA to
inactivate a C. elegans gene. The researchers found that injected sense-strand RNA was equally
as effective as antisense RNA at inhibiting gene function (Guo et al. (1995) Cell 81: 611-620).
Further investigation revealed that the active agent was modest amounts of double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA) that contaminated in vitro RNA preparations. Researchers further determined that exon
sequences are required and that introns and promoter sequences, while ineffective, did not appear
to compromise RNAi.
[0006] RNAi can act systemically. This systemic potency was demonstrated by Timmons and
Fire (1998 Nature 395: 854). Timmons and Fire performed a simple experiment that produced
an astonishing result. They fed to nematodes bacteria that had been engineered to express
double-stranded RNA corresponding to the C. elegans unc-22 gene. The transgenic nematodes
developed a phenotype similar to that of unc-22 mutants. The results of this and variety of other
experiments, in C. elegans and other organisms, indicate that RNAi acts to destabilize cellular
RNA after RNA processing.
[0007] Double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) can provoke gene silencing in numerous in vivo
contexts including Drosophila, C. elegans, planaria, hydra, trypanosomes, fungi and plants.
Furthermore, short interfering RNA (siRNA), possessing the unique capability to specifically
knock down an undesired expression of gene, holds great promises for therapeutics of diversified
human diseases. In fact, in it was reported in 2009 that there were 12 ongoing clinical trials
using siRNA to treat diseases. Cheng et al., siRNA Delivery and Targeting,Molecular
Pharmaceutics, 2009, 6(3):649-650. Of the 12 ongoing trials, 8 trials used naked siRNA for
local treatment of ocular and respiratory diseases. Castanotto, et al., The promises andpitfalls of
RNA -interference-basedtherapeutics,Nature, 2009, 457(7228):426-433. In February 2013, there
were 28 siRNA clinical trials reported by the National Institute of Health. See National Institute
of Health Clinical Trials website. Many of the 28 trials appear to use naked siRNA.
[0008] The clinical application of siRNA is constrained by inefficient delivery systems.
Specifically, there is a lack of delivery vehicles that are safe, stable, and efficient. To date,
various delivery systems have been proposed. Such systems include cationic liposomes, cell
penetrating peptides (CPPs) and cationic polymers. Tseng et al., Lipid-basedsystemic delivery of
siRNA, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 2009, 61(9):721-731 and Lewis et al., Systemic

2007, 59(2-3):115-123.
[0009] Cationic liposomes and cationic lipids, such as Lipofectamine@ and lipid-like materials,
are used widely for in vitro studies with high effectiveness; however, the toxicity and low
efficiency still restrain their in vivo applications.
[0010] For the CPPs-based approaches, RNAi molecules are assembled with CPPs or CPP
bioconjugates into complexed particles with significantly improved delivery efficiency.

Delivery Into Mammalian Cells, Molecular Therapy, 2009, 17(1):95-103 and Davis et al.,
Evidence of RNAi in humansfrom systemically administeredsiRNA via targeted nanoparticles,
Nature, 2010, 464(7291):1067-Ul40. Nevertheless, the formation of such assembled structure
was driven by weak noncovalent interactions and these particles were generally unstable,
particularly against serum nucleases which leads to degradation and poor targeting of the RNAi.
[0011] For the cationic-polymer-based approaches, siRNA are assembled with cationic polymers
is mainly through the electrostatic interactions. The unique proton sponge effect of the cationic
polymers provides the complexes with improved intracellular delivery efficiency. However,
similar to the CPPs-based approach, such assembled systems are unstable and readily dissociate
and release their siRNA payload before they reach the cytoplasm of the target cells.
[0012] Accordingly, in spite of such intensive efforts, the design and synthesis of an effective
delivery vehicle for siRNA remains challenging. Thus, there is an ongoing need to develop
novel siRNA-delivery methods that are highly robust and effective. Success of this work will
provide a general delivery platform with low toxicity and long intracellular half-life for practical
therapeutic applications.

                         BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0024] Figure 1 depicts an illustration of the synthesis and delivery of DNA cassette
nanocapsules: 1) self-assembly of hydrophilic monomer A, positively charged monomer B,
degradable crosslinker C and non-degradable crosslinker D around DNA cassette; 2): formation
of DNA cassette nanocapsules through in situ polymerization; 3): delivery; IV): release of DNA
cassette and expression of siRNA.
[0025] Figure 2 depicts a schematic illustration of the synthesis and delivery of single siRNA
nanocapsules. Step I of the schematic depicts a positively charged, polymerizable monomer that
interacts with the negatively charged siRNA. Step II of the schematic depicts the
polymerization of pH-degradable crosslinkers and hydrophilic monomers to create a polymer
network that that wraps each siRNA molecule. Step III of the schematic depicts crosslinked
shell protecting the cored siRNA from hydrolysis. Step IV of the schematic depicts the stability
of the polymer nanocapsules in serum (pH-7.4) and their ability to escape from the endosomes
upon the degradation of the shell that releases the siRNA to the cytoplasm.
[0026] More specifically, Step I depicts: starting with a positively charged, polymerizable
monomer , acryl-spermine (1), electrostatic interactions enrich 1 around the surface of the
negatively charged siRNA. Step II depicts: subsequent room-temperature polymerization in an
aqueous solution, which contains the pH-degradable crosslinkers (2) and hydrophilic monomers
(3), wraps each siRNA molecule with a thin shell of polymer network. Step III depicts: a
crosslinked shell well protects the cored siRNA from hydrolysis; while tuning the ratio of 1 and
3 allows precise control of the surface charge ensuring the effective cellular transduction of the
polymer nanocapsules. Step IV depicts: (2) is stable in neutral pH but is rapidly degraded in
acidic environment, such as late endosomes with pH ~ 5.4. It is believed that this unique
responsive design will provide the polymer nanocapsules with outstanding stability in serum (pH
 ~ 7.4), while enabling their escape from endosomes upon the degrading of the shell that releases
the siRNA to the cytoplasma. Furthermore, this synthetic approach allows for the immobilization
of targeting components (e.g., antibody) to the polymer nanocapsules surface, allowing targeted
delivery of siRNA.

cocktails of degradable and non-degradable crosslinkers. Fig. 9B depicts the stability of CCR5
shRNA DNA cassette nanocapsule monitored by DLS in water. The initial shell thickness of the
polymer nanocapsules was estimated from Ro - R*, where Ro is the initial diameter of DNA
nanocapsules and R*is the diameter of a DNA molecule (the final diameter after degradation).
The degradation degree was calculated as [Ro-Rt]/[Ro-R*]X100%, where Rt is the diameter of
nanocapsules.
[0034] Figure 10 depicts the down-regulation of CCR5 in HEK293 cells by shl005 DNA
cassette nanocapsules with different ratios (5:0; 3:2; 2:3 and 1:4) of degradable crosslinker
(Glycerol 1,3-diglycerolate diacrylate, GDGDA) to non-degradable crosslinker (N,N'
methylenesbisacrylamide, BIS). On day 0 of culture cells were transduced with DNA cassette
nanocapsules for 4 hours. On day 3, 5 and 9 of culture cells were labeled with anti-CCR5 and

nanocapsules prepared with crosslinker #1 (i.e., 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate).
[0037] Figure 13 depicts the ability of neutral monomers to affect the size of the siRNA
nanocapsules. As can be seen in the figure, N-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl) propan-2-yl)
acrylamide produced the smallest nanocapsules (less than 25nm) and acrylamide produced the
largest nanocapsules (greater than 200nm).

nanocapsules at 0, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 300nM for 4 h at 37 oC in serum-free medium. Then
mediums were changed to DMEM with 10% Bovine Fetal Serum. After 48 h, the luciferase
activity was determined using a 96-wells plate reader.
[0039] Figure 15 depicts the pH titration curve of nanocapsules and confirms that one of the
polymer nanocapsules has about 60% of buffer capacity of PEI25K between pH 7.3 and 5.5. The
buffering capacity of the nanocapsule was measured by acid-base titration. The nanocapsule
solutions (8.3 mM in terms of total molar concentration of ioniziable amine groups), which were
initially adjusted to pH 10, were titrated with 0.01 M HCl. The pH profiles were recorded at
room temperature.
[0040] Figure 16 depicts the TEM picture of BSA control nanoparticle. It is synthesized using
the same formulation as that of siRNA nanocapsules and does not show the dark cores in the

spermine, tris-acrylamide and glycerol dimethacrylate (molar ratio = 5:5:1) dissolved in 0.5mL
deoxygenated and deionized water was mixed with BSA in the microcentrifugetube (final molar

[0048] As used herein, the terms "target" refers to a section of a DNA or RNA strand of a
double-stranded DNA or an RNA that is complementary to a section of a DNA or RNA strand,
including all transcribed regions, that serves as a matrix for transcription. A target gene, usually
the sense strand, is a gene whose expression is to be selectively inhibited or silenced through
RNA interference.
[0049] As used herein, the term "polymer nanocapsules" refers to a composition comprising a
"polymer shell" and a "RNAi molecule."
[0050] As used herein, the term "polymer shell" refers to the polymer portion of the RNAi
polymer nanocapsules comprising one or more positively charged polymer monomers, one or
more crosslinkers, and optionally one or more neutral polymer monomers. Examples of
positively charged monomers, crosslinkers, and neutral monomers are provided in Table 1,
Table 2, and Table 3.
[0051] As used herein, the term "RNAi molecule" refers to a RNA or DNA molecule that plays
a role in RNA interference. Specifically, an RNAi molecule refers to a shRNA, siRNA, or
dsRNA as disclosed herein. A small hairpin RNA (shRNA) is a RNA sequence that forms a tight
hairpin turn that can be used to silence gene expression by RNA interference. shRNAs can be
delivered to target cells using DNA plasmids, viral vectors, or bacterial vectors. As used herein,
shRNA can be delivered to cells using DNA cassettes. Double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA)
comprise a broad group of viruses. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a class of double stranded
RNA molecules. siRNAs are short, generally around 20-25 base pairs in length. siRNA can be
used to silence gene expression by RNA interference. Furthermore, siRNA can also act in
RNAi-related pathways such as viral and retroviral infection.
[0052] As used herein, the terms "degradable polymer" and "nondegradable polymer" refer to
the ability of the polymers described herein to degrade into smaller fragments. In certain
embodiments of this invention, degradable polymers can break down at physiological pH. In

can break down at physiological pH. In certain embodiments, a mixture of degradable and
nondegradable polymers can break down at approximately pH 7.4.
[0053] As used herein, the terms "mutant gene" and "target mutant gene" refer to a gene
comprising at least one point mutation relative to the corresponding normal, non-mutated cellular
gene (referred to herein as the "corresponding wild-type gene"). The terms mutant gene and
target mutant gene specifically encompass any variant of a normal cellular gene or gene fragment
whose expression is associated with a disease or disorder (e.g., an oncogene).
[0054] As used herein, the term "conjugate" or "conjugate agent" or "surface-conjugated
targeting agent" or "polymer nanocapsule conjugates" refers to any moiety, such as a protein or
effective portion thereof, that is conjugated to the polymer nanocapsules and provides specific
targeting of the polymer nanocapsules to the surface of a specific cell type thereby providing
directed delivery of the siRNA or shRNA to a specific cell type. For example, the conjugate
agent can binding to a cell-specific cell surface receptor, thereby bringing the polymer
nanocapsules into immediate proximity to the target cell. In certain embodiments, the conjugates
used to achieve specific targeting of the polymer nanocapsules include CD4, CD8, CD45,
CD 133, aHLA, and transferrin. In other embodiments, the conjugates can be cell-specific
antibodies or fragments thereof. Additional examples of conjugates used to target specific cell
types are described below in the Detailed Description.
[0055] The term "complementary RNA strand" (also referred to herein as the "antisense strand")
refers to the strand of a dsRNA which is complementary to an mRNA transcript that is formed
during expression of the target gene, or its processing products. As used herein, the term
"complementary nucleotide sequence" refers to the region on the complementary RNA strand
that is complementary to a region of an mRNA transcript of the target mutant gene (i.e., "the
corresponding nucleotide sequence" of the target gene). "dsRNA" refers to a ribonucleic acid
molecule having a duplex structure comprising two complementary and anti-parallel nucleic acid
strands. Not all nucleotides of a dsRNA must exhibit Watson-Crick base pairs. The maximum
number of base pairs is the number of nucleotides in the shortest strand of the dsRNA. The RNA
strands may have the same or a different number of nucleotides. The complementary nucleotide
region of a complementary RNA strand is less than 25, preferably 19 to 24, more preferably 20
to 24, even more preferably 21 to 23, and most preferably 22 or 23 nucleotides in length. The
                                                  12

    WO 2013/138783                                                             PCT/US2013/032615
complementary RNA strand is less than 30, preferably fewer than 25, more preferably 21 to 24,
and most preferably 23 nucleotides in length. dsRNAs comprising a complementary or antisense
strand of this length (known as "short interfering RNA" or "siRNA") are particularly efficient in
inhibiting the expression of the target mutant gene. "Introducing into" means uptake or
absorption in the cell, as is understood by those skilled in the art. Absorption or uptake of
dsRNA can occur through cellular processes, or by auxiliary agents or devices. For example, for
in vivo delivery, dsRNA can be injected into a tissue site or administered systemically. In vitro
delivery includes methods known in the art such as electroporation and lipofection.
[0056] As used herein, "selective inhibition of expression" means that a dsRNA has a greater
inhibitory effect on the expression of a target mutant gene than on the corresponding wild-type
gene. Preferably, the expression level of the target mutant gene is less than 98%, less than 95%,
less than 90%, less than 80%, less than 70%, less than 60%, less than 50%, less than 40%, less
than 30%, less than 20%, or less than 10% of the expression level of the corresponding wild-type
gene.
[0057] As used herein and as known in the art, the term "identity" is the relationship between
two or more polynucleotide sequences, as determined by comparing the sequences. Identity also
means the degree of sequence relatedness between polynucleotide sequences, as determined by
the match between strings of such sequences. Identity can be readily calculated (see, e.g.,
Computation Molecular Biology, Lesk, A. M., eds., Oxford University Press, New York (1998),
and Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, D. W., ed., Academic Press, New
York (1993), both of which are incorporated by reference herein). While there exist a number of
methods to measure identity between two polynucleotide sequences, the term is well known to
skilled artisans (see, e.g., Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic
Press (1987); and Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov., M. and Devereux, J., eds., M. Stockton
Press, New York (1991)). Methods commonly employed to determine identity between
sequences include, for example, those disclosed in Carillo, H., and Lipman, D., SIAM J. Applied
Math. (1988) 48:1073. "Substantially identical," as used herein, means there is a very high
degree of homology (preferably 100% sequence identity) between the sense strand of the dsRNA
and the corresponding part of the target gene. However, dsRNA having greater than 9 0% or 95%
sequence identity may be used in the present invention, and thus sequence variations that might

be expected due to genetic mutation, strain polymorphism, or evolutionary divergence can be
tolerated. Although 100% identity is preferred, the dsRNA may contain single or multiple base
pair random mismatches between the RNA and the target gene.
[0058] As used herein, the term "treatment" refers to the application or administration of a
therapeutic agent to a patient, or application or administration of a therapeutic agent to an
isolated tissue or cell line from a patient, who has a disorder, e.g., a disease or condition, a
symptom of disease, or a predisposition toward a disease, with the purpose to cure, heal,
alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve, or affect the disease, the symptoms of
disease, or the predisposition toward disease.
[0059] As used herein, a "pharmaceutical composition" comprises a pharmacologically effective
amount of a dsRNA and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein,
"pharmacologically effective amount," "therapeutically effective amount" or simply "effective
amount" refers to that amount of an RNA effective to produce the intended pharmacological,
therapeutic or preventive result. For example, if a given clinical treatment is considered effective
when there is at least a 25% reduction in a measurable parameter associated with a disease or
disorder, a therapeutically effective amount of a drug for the treatment of that disease or disorder
is the amount necessary to effect at least a 25% reduction in that parameter.
[0060] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to a carrier for administration of a
therapeutic agent. Such carriers include, but are not limited to, saline, buffered saline, dextrose,
water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The term specifically excludes cell culture
medium. For drugs administered orally, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not
limited to pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, disintegrating agents,
binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and
preservatives. Suitable inert diluents include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium
phosphate, and lactose, while corn starch and alginic acid are suitable disintegrating agents.
Binding agents may include starch and gelatin, while the lubricating agent, if present, will
generally be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a
material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, to delay absorption in the
gastrointestinal tract.

                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Introduction
[0061] RNA interference is a powerful tool to silence specific gene expression and a variety of
RNAi-based therapies are being considered for human diseases. However, the major impediment
to the effective use of RNAi for applications in humans is its effective delivery into cells. For
example, transduction of short hairpin shRNA into hematopoietic stem cells by lentiviral vector
has shown to allow endogenous synthesis of siRNA and is able to provide sustainable gene
silencing. However, the toxic myeloablative regimens used in the transplant procedure and the
limited engraftment of gene-modified cells currently constrains wide application.
[0062] A variety of non-viral siRNA delivery systems have been proposed, including cationic
liposomes, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) and cationic polymers. Cationic lipids, such as
Lipofectamine@ and lipid-like materials, are widely used for in vitro studies and have shown
potential for in vivo gene silencing especially in the liver. As an example of the CPPs-based
approach, siRNA can be assembled with CPPs or CPP bioconjugates into complexed particles to
generate significantly improved delivery efficiency. Nevertheless, the formation of such
structures is driven by weak non-covalent interactions and these particles were generally
unstable, particularly, against serum nucleases.
[0063] For the cationic-polymer-based approach, siRNA can be assembled with cationic
polymers mainly through electrostatic interactions. For example, cationic polymer-based
nanoparticles with transferrin as a targeting agent have been shown to deliver siRNA molecules
to tumors in humans and reduce the expression of the ribonucleotide reductase sub-unit RRM2,
an anti-cancer target. However, similar to the CPP-based approach, such systems are based upon
non-covalent electrostatic self-assembly, which have competition from electrolytes and polyions
within the bloodstream. Therefore, in spite of intensive efforts, the design and synthesis of an
effective delivery vehicle for siRNA remains a challenge.
[0064] Despite the challenges described above, siRNA has become one of the most promising
and specific drug candidates with broad potential for the treatment of diverse human diseases
attributed to their unique ability to regulate specific genes and control the expression of
                                                   15

    WO 2013/138783                                                               PCT/US2013/032615
corresponding proteins. Current commercial products for in vitro siRNA delivery include
lipofection and nucleofection. Although these two methods are widly applicable in many cell
lines, the delivery efficiency and the toxicity in primary cells remains a formidable challenge.
[0065] For in vivo delivery of siRNA, siRNA-mediated gene silencing in mammals through
systemic administration was achieved using naked siRNA. However this administration is not
compatible with and has many limitations for use in human. Several recent studies have shown
improved siRNA delivery in mouse models and nonhuman primates using positively charged
peptide or proteins like arginine peptide, CpG oligonucleotide and protamine. Crombez et al., A
New Potent Secondary Amphipathic Cell-penetratingPeptidefor siRNA Delivery Into
Mammalian Cells, Molecular Therapy, 2009, 17(1):95-103. Another recent study demonstrates
the presence of an RNAi mechanism in humans through systemic administration of siRNA a
nanoparticles targeted to melanoma cells. Davis et al., Evidence ofRNAi in humansfrom
systemically administeredsiRNA via targeted nanoparticles,Nature, 2010, 464(7291):1067
 1070. Nevertheless, highly effective delivery to targeting sites still persists as a major obstacle.
In addition, potential adverse immune responses caused by the siRNA remains to be solved.
[0066] As described herein, highly stabilized RNAi molecule polymer nanocapsules ("polymer
nanocapsules") were fabricated through an in situ polymerization technique, which introduced a
protective crosslinked degradable polymer shell covering the surface of the RNAi molecules
with designed charges and properties. This crosslinked polymer shell provides protection to the
RNAi molecules from RNase degradation, temperature dissociation and serum inactivation.
Furthermore, degradability of the polymer network assigns a control-releasing property to RNAi
molecules, which results in a less intracellular immune response. By adjusting the charge of the
polymer nanocapsules, delivery efficiency of RNAi molecules into human cells was achieved.
Furthermore, efficient RNAi molecule delivery into a broad variety of cells including 293T,
Hela, CEM, and PBMCs was achieved with highly positive-charged nanocapsules.
[0067] Furthermore, surface-conjugated targeting agents on optimized nanocapsules provided
successful targeted delivery of RNAi molecules into cells of interest, such as T-cells. The
diversified and controllable nontargeting and targeting abilities provided to the RNAi molecule
delivery will have important implications for many in vitro tests and clinical applications using
RNAi molecules to knock down any desired gene expressions.

Polymer Nanocapsules
[0068] This invention provides a novel strategy through self-assembly and in situ polymerization
technology to imprint RNAi molecules into crosslinked polymer nanocapsules. In certain
embodiments, the polymer nanocapsules are approximately 20-100nm in diameter. The small
diameters of the polymer nanocapsules maximize the protection of the RNAi molecules from
external RNase attack and serum neutralization.
[0069] In specific embodiments, the polymer nanocapsules are 1Onm-20nm, 20-25nm, 25nm
30nm, 30nm-35nm, 35nm-40nm, 40nm-45nm, 45nm-50nm, 50nm-55nm, 55nm-60nm, 60nm

26nm, 27nm, 28nm, 29nm, 30nm, 31nm, 32nm, 33nm, 34nm, 35nm, 36nm, 37nm, 38nm, 39nm,
40nm, 41nm, 42nm, 43nm, 44nm, 45nm, 46nm, 47nm, 48nm, 49nm, 50nm, 5Inm, 52nm, 53nm,
54nm, 55nm, 56nm, 57nm, 58nm, 59nm, 60nm, 61nm, 62nm, 63nm, 64nm, 65nm, 66nm, 67nm,

 108nm, 109nm, 110nm, 11Inm,112nm, 113nm, 114nm, 115nm, 116nm, 117nm, 118nm,
 119nm, or 120nm in diameter. In specific embodiments the polymer nanocapsules are 120nm
 130nm, 130nm-140nm, 140nm-150nm, 150nm-160nm, 160nm-170nm, 170nm-180nm, 180nm
 190nm, 190nm-200nm, 200nm-210nm, 220nm-230nm, 230nm-240nm, 240nm-250nm, or larger
than 250nm in diameter.
[0070] In certain embodiments, additional advantages of the polymer nanocapsules disclosed
herein include nontargeting and targeting ability, higher efficiency, and lower adverse immune
response. For example, the higher efficiency may result from increased uptake and more
directed delivery.
[0071] Furthermore highly stabilized RNAi molecules inside the protective nanocapsule is able
to be fully released once the nanostructured polymer shell is degraded in endosomes and
                                                 17

     WO 2013/138783                                                                   PCT/US2013/032615
lysosomes. In certain embodiments, a nontargeting polymer encapsulated RNAi molecules can
be transduced into primary cells such as PBMCs in vitro with superior efficiency and
noncytoxicity compared to the low efficiency and high toxicity resulting from liposome
transduction.
[0072] Importantly, by choosing and designing appropriate polymer charge, the method of RNAi
molecule delivery to specific purposes (such as targeting by conjugating moieties to the
polymner nanocapsules as described herein) can be modulated.
[0073] In certain embodiments, the ratio of degradable crosslinker to non-degradable crosslinker
is 1:1, 1:2, 2:1, 1:3, 2:3, 3:1, 3:2, 4:1, 1:4, 4:3, 3:4, 5:1, 1:5, 2:5, 5:2, 5:3, 3:5, 4:5, 5:4, 6:1, 1:6,
 1:7, 7:1, 2:7, 7:2, 3:7, 7:3, 4:7, 7:4, 5:7, 7:5, 6:7, 7:6, 8:1, 1:8, 3:8, 8:3, 5:8, 8:5, 7:8, 8:7, 9:1, 1:9,
2:9, 9:2, 4:9, 9:4, 5:9, 9:5, 7:9, 9:7, 8:9, 9:8, 10:1, 1:10, 3:10, 10:3, 7:10, 10:7, 9:10, 10:9 or any
other ratio that one of skill in the art would know to use.
[0074] In certain embodiments, the degradable crosslinkers are one or more of crosslinker 1, 2,
3, 4, or 6 in Table 2. In certain embodiments, the non-degradable crosslinkers are crosslinker 5
in Table 2.
[0075] In certain embodiments, the polymer nanocapsules are designed to degrade in 1 hour, or 2
hours, or 3 hours, or 4 hours, or 5 hours, or 6 hours, or 7 hours, or 8 hours, or 9 hours, or 10
hours, or 11 hours, or 12 hours, or 13 hours, or 14 hours, or 15 hours, or 16 hours, or 17 hours, or
 18 hours, or 19 hours, or 20 hours, or 21 hours, or 22 hours, or 23 hours, or 1 day, or 2 days, or 3
days, or 4 days or 5 days, or 6 days, or 1 week, or 2 weeks, or 3 weeks, or 1 month or any
combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the polymer nanocapsules are designed to degrade
at any of the above rates at a physiological pH. In specific embodiments, the polymer
nanocapsules are designed to degrade at any of the rates above post-administration to a subject in
need thereof.
[0076] In specific embodiments, RNAi molecules can be effectively delivered to specific sites in
vivo. In certain embodiments, a targeting agent (i.e., a conjugate or conjugate agent) is
conjugated to the polymer nanocapsule. In certain embodiments the conjugation prevents the
dissociation of the targeting agent from the polymer particle. In specific embodiments,
cyclodextrin and adamantane can be used for targeting agent conjugation.

[0077] In one embodiment, the invention is practiced using nontargeted and targeted polymer
nanocapsules RNAi molecule delivery with high efficiency and low toxicity for in vitro testing
and in vivo targeting to specific tissues and organs via intravenous injection.
[0078] The enhanced stability of RNAi molecules attributed to the cross-linked polymer also
ensures its long-lasting circulation in body before it reaches the targeting sites. Overall, the novel
RNAi molecule delivery technology described herein has a notable efficiency, augmented
stability, and minimal toxicity both in vitro and predicted in vivo.

Methods of Treating Diseases Caused By Expression of a Target Gene
[0090] In one embodiment, the invention relates to a method for treating a subject having a
disease or at risk of developing a disease caused by the expression of a target mutant gene. In
certain embodiments, the polymer nanocapsules described herein can act as novel therapeutic
agents for controlling one or more of cellular proliferative and/or differentiative disorders. In
certain embodiments, the polymer nanocapsules can act as novel therapeutic agents for
controlling one or more immune or immunodeficiency disorders. In certain embodiments, the
polymer nanocapsules can act as novel therapeutic agents for preventing viral replication or viral
infection. In certain embodiments, the polymer nanocapsules can act as novel therapeutic agents
for controlling one or more neurological or neurodegenerative disorders. In certain
embodiments, the polymer nanocapsules can act as novel therapeutic agents for treating or
preventing cancer.
[0091] In certain embodiments, the polymer nanocapsules can act as novel therapeutic agents for
treating advanced cancers, pachyonychia congenital, age-related macular degeneration, choroidal
neovascularization, metastatic melanoma, metastatic melanoma without CNS metastases, chronic
myeloid leukemia, solid tumors, advanced solid tumors, optic atrophy, non-arteric anterior
ischemic optic neuropathy, pancreatic cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, diavetic
macular edema, hypercholesterolemia, colorectal cancer with hepatic metastases, pancreatic
cancer with hepatic metastases, gastric cancer with hepatic metastases, breast cancer with hepatic
metastases ovarian cancer with hepatic metastases, preeclampsia, neuroblastoma, ocular
hypertension, open angle glaucoma, glaucoma, ocular pain, dry eye syndrome, kidney injury,

                                                   25

    WO 2013/138783                                                              PCT/US2013/032615
suppressing retroviral viral infections. In specific embodiments, the polymer nanocapsules can
act as novel therapeutic agents for blocking, preventing, or downregulating retrovirus or virus
replication.
[0093] In certain embodiments, the polymer nanocapsules described herein can be administered
by intravitreal injection, intravenously, by injection into the callus on the bottom of one foot, by
oral administration, subcutaneously, and by any other mode of pharmaceutical administration
known to one of skill in the art.
[0094] In certain embodiments, the method comprises administering a pharmaceutical
composition of the invention to the subject, such that expression of the target mutant gene is
silenced or down regulated. In certain embodiments the subject is a mammal. In certain
embodiments the mammal is a human. Because of their high specificity, the polymer
nanocapsules of the present invention specifically target the mutant genes of diseased cells and
tissues, as described herein.
[0095] In the prevention of disease, the target gene may be one which is required for initiation or
maintenance of the disease, or which has been identified as being associated with a higher risk of
contracting the disease. In the treatment of disease, the polymer nanocapsules can be brought
into contact with the cells or tissue exhibiting the disease. As one non-limiting example, polymer
nanocapsules are substantially identical to all or part of a mutated gene associated with cancer, or
one expressed at high levels in tumor cells may be brought into contact with or introduced into a
cancerous cell or tumor gene. As another non-limiting example, polymer nanocapsules are
substantially identical to all or part of a mutated gene associated with a viral or retroviral disease.
Specifically, a non-limiting example of a retroviral disease that can be treated with the polymer
nanocapsules described herein is HIV (see Figures 3, 4, and 6-10).
[0096] Non-limiting examples of cellular proliferative and/or differentiative disorders include
cancer, e.g., carcinoma, sarcoma, metastatic disorders or hematopoietic neoplastic disorders, e.g.,
leukemias. A metastatic tumor can arise from a multitude of primary tumor types, including but
not limited to those of prostate, colon, lung, breast and liver origin. As used herein, the terms
"cancer," "hyperproliferative," and "neoplastic" refer to cells having the capacity for autonomous
growth, i.e., an abnormal state of condition characterized by rapidly proliferating cell growth.

These terms are meant to include all types of cancerous growths or oncogenic processes,
metastatic tissues or malignantly transformed cells, tissues, or organs, irrespective of
histopathologic type or stage of invasiveness. Proliferative disorders also include hematopoietic
neoplastic disorders, including diseases involving hyperplastic/neoplatic cells of hematopoietic
origin, e.g., arising from myeloid, lymphoid or erythroid lineages, or precursor cells thereof.
[0097] Mutations in cellular genes that directly or indirectly control cell growth and
differentiation are considered to be the main cause of cancer. There are approximately thirty
families of genes, called oncogenes, which are implicated in human tumor formation. Members
of one such family, the RAS gene family, are carried in a broad range of eukaryotes and are
frequently found to be mutated in human tumors. Polymer nanocapsules of this invention can be
used to target such oncogenes to knock down or prevent their expression.
[0098] In addition to oncogenes, the methods and compositions of the invention can be applied
to other disease-related target genes having a point mutation. Gene mutations have been reported
in more than 1000 different human genes. Data on these mutations and their associated
phenotypes have been collated and are available online through two major databases: Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man in Baltimore and the Human Gene Mutation Database in Cardiff.
For example, there is a high frequency of CG to TG or CA mutations in the human genome due
to deamination of 5' methyl-cytosine. Short deletions or insertions of less than 20 nucleotides are
also very common mutations in humans. See, e.g., Antonarakis, S. E., Eur. Pediatr. (2000)
 159(3):5173-8.
[0099] Furthermore, Sachidanandam et al. describes a map of human genome sequence variation
containing 1.42 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, which is useful for identifying
biomedically important genes for diagnosis and therapy (Sachidanandam, R., et al., Nature
(2001) 409(6822):821-2 and Nature (2001) 409(6822):822-3). The map integrates all publicly
available SNPs with described genes and other genomic features. An estimated 60,000 SNPs fall
within exon (coding and untranslated regions), and 85% of exons are within 5 kb of the nearest
SNP. Clifford et al. provides expression-based genetic/physical maps of single-nucleotide
polymorphisms identified by the cancer genome anatomy project (Clifford, R., et al., Genome
Res (2000) 10(8):1259-65). In addition to SNP maps, Sachidanandam et al. provide maps
containing SNPs in genes expressed in breast, colon, kidney, liver, lung, or prostate tissue.

Methods of Inhibiting Expression of a Mutant Gene
[00101]         In yet another aspect, the invention relates to a method for inhibiting the
expression of a mutant gene in subject. The method comprises administering a composition of
the invention to the subject such that expression of the mutant gene is silenced as compared to
the corresponding wild-type gene. In certain embodiments the subject is a mammal. In certain
embodiments the mammal is a human.
[00102]         Because of their high specificity, the siRNA nanocapsules of the present invention
specifically target RNAs (primary or processed) of target mutant genes, and at surprisingly low
dosages. Compositions and methods for inhibiting the expression of a target gene using polymer
nanocapsules can be performed as described herein.
[001031         In one embodiment, the invention comprises administering a composition
comprising polymer nanocapsules, wherein the polymer nanocapsules comprise a nucleotide
sequence which is substantially complementary to an RNA transcript of the target mutant gene
and partially complementary to the corresponding wild-type gene. When the subject to be treated
is a mammal, such as a human, the composition may be administered by any means known in the
art including, but not limited to oral or parenteral routes, including intravenous, intramuscular,
intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, transdermal, airway (aerosol), rectal, vaginal and topical
(including buccal and sublingual) administration. In preferred embodiments, the compositions
are administered by intravenous or intraparenteral infusion or injection.
[00104]         The methods for inhibition the expression of a target gene can be applied to any
mutant gene one wishes to silence, thereby selectively inhibiting its expression. Non-limiting
examples of human genes which can be targeted for silencing include oncogenes cytokinin gene,
idiotype protein genes, prion genes, genes that expresses molecules that induce angiogenesis,
genes that encode adhesion molecules, genes that encode cell surface receptors, genes of proteins
that are involved in metastasizing and/or invasive processes, genes of proteases as well as of
molecules that regulate apoptosis and the cell cycle, genes that express the EGF receptor, genes

replication, genes that cause neurodegenerative disorders, genes that cause protein aggregation

cause neurological disorders, genes that cause cardiac disorders, and genes that cause
psychological disorders. One of skill in the art would understand which genes are encompassed
by the broad categories of exemplary genes described above.
Methods of Manufacture
[00105]         In certain embodiments, the polymer nanocapsules described herein are
manufactured to achieve a specific size, to target a specific site for gene downregulation, and to
downregulate a specific gene. The size of the polymer nanocapsules described herein can be
determined based on the polymer: crosslinker ratio as described herein. Targeted delivery can be
achieved, for example, using conjugate agents that are attached (i.e., conjugated) to the exterior
of the polymer nanocapsules as described herein. Furthermore, the specific binding of an RNAi
molecule of a polymer nanocapsules described herein to a specific gene (thereby decreasing
specific gene expression) can be achieved by designing the RNAi molecule using methods
known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Birmingham et al., "A protocol for designing siRNAs
with high functionality and specificity," Nature Protocols, 2007;2(9):2068-78. Furthermore, the
ability of the polymer nanocapsules to deliver the RNAi molecules to the target site can be
optimized and determined by adjusting the ratios of degradable:nondegradable polymers as
described herein.
Methods of Administration
[001061         The pharmaceutical compositions encompassed by the invention may be
administered by any means known in the art including, but not limited to oral or parenteral
routes, including intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, transdermal, airway
(aerosol), rectal, vaginal and topical (including buccal and sublingual) administration. In
preferred embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered by intravenous or
intraparenteral infusion or injection.

                                            EXAMPLES
Example 1. Manufacture of Nanocapsules
[00107]          Highly stabilized siRNA polymer nanocapsules were fabricated through an in situ
polymerization technique as described in Example 1 and Figures 1 and 2. The manufacture of
a siRNA nanocapsule platform depicted in Figure 1, starts with a positively charged monomer
A, a crosslinker B, a neutral co-monomer C and enriches these molecules around the surface of
the negatively charged siRNA through electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding. A series
of positively charged monomers (Table 1), crosslinkers (Table 2) and neutral co-monomers
(Table 3) were used in the manufacture of the polymer nanocapsule platform. Different
crosslinkers, for example those listed in Table 2, can be used to form copolymer coatings with
tunable composition, structure, surface property, and functionality.
[001081          This in situ polymerization technique introduced a protective crosslinked
degradable polymer shell covering on the surface of the siRNA with designed charges and
properties. This crosslinked polymer shell provides protection to the siRNA from RNase
degradation, temperature dissociation and serum inactivation. Non-liming examples of
crosslinkers that can be used in the siRNA nanocapsules are provided in Table 2.
Example 2. Manufacture of Nanocapsules Using Acryl-Spermine
[00109]          In this example, the preparation of acryl-spermine was achieved by reacting
spermine with acrylic acid, hydroxysuccinimide ester (NAS). Briefly, spermine (100 mg) and
NAS (80 mg) were dissolved in 1 mL chloroform, respectively. NAS solution was then added
into spermine solution gradually at room temperature under vigorous stirring. After overnight
reacting, the mixture was filtered to remove by-products. The filtrate was then dried by rotary
evaporation, followed by re-dispersing with ddH20. After removal of insoluble substance, the
solution was lyophilized. Finally, acryl-spermine was purified by process TLC. One of skill in
the art that this is an exemplary method of manufacturing acryl-spermine and will understand
that alternative methods could be used to reach the same result.
                                                  30

     WO 2013/138783                                                            PCT/US2013/032615
[00110]          As illustrated in Figure 2, the manufacture of a nanocapsules began with a
positively charged, polymerizable monomer. For purposed of this example, the positively
charged, polymerizable monomer is acryl-spermine which was prepared as described above. The
first step of the process of manufacturing the polymer nanocapsules required electrostatic
interactions enriched around the surface of the negatively charged siRNA. After the initial
interactions, subsequent room-temperature polymerization in an aqueous solution took place
with the pH-degradable crosslinkers and hydrophilic monomers. During the room temperature
polymerization, each siRNA molecule was wrapped in a thin shell of polymer network. Such a
crosslinked shell served to protect the cored siRNA from hydrolysis. Specific tuning of the ration
of the acryl-spermine and the hydrophilic monomers allowed precise control of the surface
charge and ensured the effective cellular transduction of the polymer nanocapsules. Moreover, 2
is stable in neutral pH but are rapidly degraded in acidic environment, such as late endosomes
with pH ~ 5.4. We believe that this unique responsive design will provide the polymer
nanocapsules with outstanding stability in serum (pH ~ 7.4), while enabling their escape from
endosomes upon the degrading of the shell that releases the siRNA to the cytoplasma (Step IV).
Furthermore, our synthetic approach allows for the immobilization of targeting components (e.g.,
antibody) to the polymer nanocapsules surface, allowing targeting delivery of siRNA.
Example 3. Ability of Nanocapsules to Protect and Deliver Encapsulated siRNA
[00111]          In order to test the efficacy of the polyrner nanocapsules described herein, a single
siRNA nanocapsule platform that efficiently delivers siRNA was generated. Schematics of how
the polymer nanocapsules are made are depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 2. These nanocapsules
of this platform were designed to protect the encapsulated siRNA from nucleases and can
effectively deliver siRNA into cells.
[00112]          In order to test the ability of the polymer nanocapsules to protect the encapsulated
siRNA and effectively deliver the siRNA into cells, the well known siRNAI 005 was used in the
preparation of the polymer nanocapsules, siRNA1005 is a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that
targets the HIV-I co-receptor CCR5. The well-characterized potency of siRNA1005 made it an
ideal candidate for demonstrating CCR5 knockdown by applying the single molecule
                                                     31

    WO 2013/138783                                                             PCT/US2013/032615
nanocapsule delivery technology. Exemplary images of nanocapsules with siRNA1005 are
presented in Figure 4 and Figure 5.
[00113]         As proof of concept we showed that CCR5 RNA can be effectively knocked
down by nanocapsules of siRNA1005. One unique advantage of this nanocapsule platform is the
ability to modify the polymer nanocapsules by selecting monomers and crosslinkers which alter
the chemical properties of size, charge, and reactivity of the particles. Non-limiting examples of
monomers and crosslinkers can be found in Table I and Table 2.
[00114]         The ability of the polymer nanocapsules to effectively protect encapsulated
materials from degradation, was also demonstrated by encapsulating proteins. For example,
EGFP, HRP, and caspase 3 were encapsulated and protected in the polymer nanocapsules.
Furthermore, the polymer nanocapsules were also used to encapsulated quantum dots and
siRNAs such as siEGFP, siLuciferase, and sii005 as described above.
Example 4. Delivery of siRNA using DNA that encodes shRNA
[00115]         Delivery of siRNA was accomplished using DNA that encodes shRNA
transcriptional units. For example, plasmid and viral vectors were used because they provide
high levels and long term expression of the siRNA.
[00116]         In this example, the polymer nanocapsule technology was further extended to
nanocapsules of DNA encoding shRNAI005. As described in Example 3, shRNA005 is an
RNAi that targets and knocks down the expression of CCR5 RNA expression. This DNA
nanocapsule technology is more challenging than the above described RNAi nanocapsule
because DNA transcription units are much larger than siRNA.
[00117]         The formulation of polymer nanocapsules platform for encapsulation of DNA
cassettes was modified by tuning monomers and crosslinkers which alter the size, charge, and
degradability of the particles. Non-limiting examples of monomers and crosslinkers are provided
in Table I and Table 2.
[00118]         Of particular interest, the polymer nanocapsules were engineered for delayed
release using crosslinkers that degrade at different rates, enabling effective siRNA activity over
                                                  32

    WO 2013/138783                                                            PCT/US2013/032615
several days or weeks. This is a big advantage over current small molecule drugs that are
required daily administration
Example 5. Synthesis and Delivery of DNA Nanocapsules
[001191         As illustrated in Figure 1, starting with the monomer A and B, crosslinker C,
these molecules self-assembled along the surface of the DNA cassettes through electrostatic
interaction and hydrogen bonding (Step 1). Then a thin network of polymer shell was formed
around the DNA cassette by subsequent in situ polymerization (Step 2), which effectively
confered new surface properties that protect the DNA. Crosslinker C was a non-degrable
crosslinker. Acid-degradable crosslinkers D were stable in neutral pH but were rapidly degraded
in acidic environment, such as late endosomes with pH around 5.4.
1001201         This unique responsive design provided the polymer nanocapsules with
outstanding stability in the physiological pH of serum (pH-7.4). It also led to effective
endosomal escape due to the "proton-sponge" effect resulting from the positive charges of
monomers B and enabled controllable release of the DNA cassette into the cytoplasm upon the
degradation progress of the shell. The DNA cassette then entered the nucleus and allowed the
endogenous generation of siRNA (Step 4).
Example 6. DNA Nanocapsule Incorporating Short Linear DNA Cassettes
[00121]         As proof of concept, we designed a model DNA nanocapsule incorporating a
short linear DNA cassette with HI expressed shl005 shRNA and HI expressed anti-EGFP
shRNA as control. Delivery of a large DNA plasmid, consisting of shRNA transcriptional units
and antibiotic resistance genes, was hindered by delivering barriers at the cell membrane and
nucleopore. Accordingly a second DNA cassette was manufactured using a minimized linear
DNA cassette of only 395 base pairs that was produced by PCR. The DNA cassette of only 395
base pairs, was able to transfer nucleopores more efficiently.
[00122]         Gel electrophoresis image of these two DNA cassettes was shown in Figure 3A.
Interestingly, the TEM image of linear naked DNA cassette stained with tungsten agent appeared
                                                   33

    WO 2013/138783                                                          PCT/US2013/032615
as a dark half circular arc with a diameter about 50 nm. In contrast, the DNA cassette
nanocapsules had a round morphology with a much smaller size of approximately 30nm. This is
likely a result of DNA condensation through complexing with polymers.
[001231          Compared to previously reported nanoparticles that contain plasmid DNA
(aproximately 150-300nm), the size of DNA cassette nanoparticles is remarkably 1/10 to 1/5 the
size. This small size of the DNA cassette nanocapsules likely leads to a high diffusional rate and
improve the delivery efficiency.
Example 7. DNA Cassette Nanocapsules Are Efficiently Delivered to Cells
[00124]         DNA cassette nanocapsules of this invention can be effectively delivered to cells.
The optical and fluorescent images of HEK-293T cells after incubation with Alexa592-labeled
DNA cassette nanocapsules for 4 hrs is shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5. The intense green
fluorescence demonstrates delivery of the FITC-labeled siRNA nanocapsules (Figure 4 and
Figure 5).
[00125]         Flow cytometry of HEK-293 T cells transduced with Alexa592-labeled DNA
cassette nanocapsules confirmed the results of the fluorescence imaging and demonstrated
successful delivery of fluorescence-labeled siRNA nanocapsule (Figure 5C).
[00126]         RNAi activity of the DNA nanocapsule in 293T cells expressing a fusion of
CCR5 and luciferase reporter gene sequence with CCR5-shRNA (shl005) was also examined
(Figure 5D). The CCR5-shRNA DNA nanocapsules down-regulated about 80% of the
bioluminescence intensity reflecting the knockout of the CCR5-luciferase fusion mRNA while
cells treated with control DNA cassette nanocapsules did not exhibit significant decreases in the
luciferase activity.
[00127]         To investigate the sensitivity of DNA nanocapsules against Dnase I, DNA
complexed with Lipofectamine@ and DNA nanocapsules were incubated with Dnase I for 1 hour
(Figure 6A).
[00128]         After acid treatment and DNA extraction, agarose gel electrophoresis showed
such nanocapsules were able to proted and maintain the integrity of the encapsulated DNA. In
                                                  34

contrast, non-encapsulated DNA in the native state and non-encapsulated DNA that was
formulated with Lipofectamine@ degraded.The DNA nanocapsules did not show obvious
cytotoxicity at the concentration of DNA cassette below 0.4 pmol. At 0.4 pmol, the viability of
cells treated with DNA nanocapsules was slightly reduced to about 85% (Figure 7).
Example 8. siRNA Nanocapsules Are Efficiently Delivered to Cells and Target Specific
Sequences
[00129]         Figure 4A shows a representative TEM image of the double-stranded siRNA
nanocapsules which target CCR5 sequence 3'-gagcatgactgacatctac-5' with an average diameter
of 25nm. Interestingly, within each nanocapsule, a dark core with diameter around 5 nm was
clearly observed, which is due to preferred complexation of siRNA with the tungsten-staining
agent used for TEM observation. Since a double-stranded siRNA (21 base pairs) has an average
molecular weight of 12 kDa and size of 3-5 nm, each of the polymer nanocapsules appears to
only contain one siRNA molecule. Figure 4B shows a fluorescent image of HEK-293 T cells
after incubation with FITC-labeled siRNA for 4 hrs. The intense green fluorescence proves the
effective delivery of the siRNA nanocapsules.
[00130]         As proof of concept, CCR5-siRNA was used to target and down-regulate CCR5
expression. It has been well demonstrated that individuals born with naturally existing mutations
in the CCR5 chemokine receptor are protected from HIV infection and disease progression.
CCR5-siRNA holds great promise as a therapeutic drug to downregulate CCR5 expression and
to develop HIV resistance in patients. To prove this concept, Figure 4C shows flourescence
images of HEK 293 cells transducted with siRNA nanocapsules targeted to CCR5 sequence (left
panel of image in Figure 4C) and EGFP sequence (right panel of image in Figure 4C). Clearly,
delivery of the CCR5-siRNA nanocapsules effectively down-regulates the CCR5-mCherry
fusion protein expression. This demonstrates the effectiveness of siRNA nanocapsules delivery
and function.
[00131]         Luciferase-expressing CWR cells stably expressing luciferase were used to test
the gene-silencing efficacy of single siRNA nanocapsules (Figure 14A). Cells treated with
luciferase siRNA nanocapsules showed a significant decrease in the luciferase activity especially
                                               35

    WO 2013/138783                                                          PCT/US2013/032615
at concentrations above 50nM, while cells treated with control siRNA nanocapsules did not
exhibit significant decrease in the luciferase activity. The siRNA nanocapsules did not show
obvious cytotoxicity at the concentration of siRNA below 200nM. At 300nM, the viability of
cells treated with siRNA nanocapsules was slightly reduced to about 75% (Figure 14B).
[00132]         Furthermore, without human serum, nanocapsules and Lipofectamine@
(Invitrogen@) silenced expression of CCR5-mCherry expression to 8% and 15%, respectively.
But in the presence of human serum, CCR5 siRNA nanocapsules still knocked down more than
85% of CCR5-mCherry expression while siRNA delivered through Lipofectamine@ only made a
number at 45%. Therefore, nanocapsules can provide extra protection and stabilization to siRNA
inside against attacking of human serum nucleases compared with Lipofectamine®.
Example 9. DNA Cassette Nanocapsules Efficiently Knockdown Gene Expression in Cells
[001331         The knockdown efficacy of DNA cassette nanocapsule was compared to standard
Lipofectamine® siRNA transduction to HEK 293T cells expressing CCR5-luciferase fusion
protein (Figure 8).
[00134]         After 48 hours, 0.1pmol of shl005 DNA cassette nanocapsule silenced the
expression of CCR5-luciferase to 45%. In stark contrast, 1OOpmol (1000x the amount) of
siRNA-Lipofectamine® complex was required to knock down the level of CCR5-luciferase to
47%. On a molar basis, the shl005 DNA cassette nanocapsule is over 1000-fold more effective
at downregulating CCR5 than si1005 siRNA formulated with Lipofectamine® (Figure 7 and
Figure 8). This result is likely due to de novo transcription of shRNA within transduced cells.
Example 10. Delayed Release and Degradable Nanocapsules
[00135]         Because of the high potency of the DNA cassette nanocapsules, DNA cassette
nanocapsules can be used in applications where sustained activity is beneficial. To accomplish
this, DNA cassette nanocapsuIes were engineered for delayed release using crosslinkers that
degrade at different rates .

    WO 2013/138783                                                          PCT/US2013/032615
[001361         The DNA nanocapsules prepared with 100% degradable crosslinkers (e.g.,
Glycerol 1,3-diglycerolate diacrylate, GDGDA) (5:0) was degraded completely after 10 hours.
The DNA nanocapsules prepared with a mixture of one part degradable crosslinker to four parts
non-degradable crosslinker (e.g., N,N'-methylene bisacrylamide, BIS) was completely degraded
after 150 hours (Figure 9). The slopes of the degradation profiles consistently increase with the
percentage of degradable crosslinkers. This confirms that a higher percentage of the degradable
crosslinkers leads to a higher degradation rate.
[00137]         Using 100% of degradable crosslinker, the downregulation of CCR5 reached 70%
at day 3 and 5 following transduction and decreased to 23% at day 9 (Figure 10).
[001381         When the ratio of degradable crosslinker to non-degradable crosslinker is 3:2, the
knockdown of CCR5 increased from 58% at day 3 to 70% at day 5 and then decreased to 42%.
[001391         The DNA nanocapsule with the ratio of degradable crosslinker to non-degradable
crosslinker at 2:3, the silencing percentage of the CCR5 increased from 53% to 64% and further

Example 12. Synthesis of siRNA Nanocapsules
[00142]         In situ polymerization and the process of manufacturing siRNA nanocapsules
with different types and ratios of siRNA was optimized. Specifically, positively charged
monomer, hydrophilic monomer and degradable crosslinkers were used to optimize the siRNA
nanocapsules.
[00143]         The effects of buffer salt, ion types, ionic strength and solvent composition on the
morphology and yield of siRNA nanocapsules was assessed.
[00144]         Varieties of targeting components were conjugated to the siRNA nanocapsules to
achieve targeted delivery of the siRNA. For example, targeting conjugates used in these
