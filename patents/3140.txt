            This is a divisional application from Australian Patent Application No.
   2014265560 and the disclosure of the complete specification thereof as originally
 5 filed is incorporated herein by reference. This application is also derived from a PCT
   International patent application filed on 13 May 2014, which claims priority under
   35 USC § 119(e) to US Provisional Patent Application No. 61/823,650 filed May
    15, 2013, the disclosure of which is also incorporated herein by reference in its
   entirety.
10                                   TECHNICAL FIELD
   [0001]       This disclosure relates to modular units that can be used in many
   different ways, including, for example, to build landscaping walls, which may
   include retaining walls that present one exposed face, or freestanding walls that
15 present two exposed faces. The units disclosed can also be used to build columns
   and at-grade or above-grade edging strips. The modular units can be used in other
   applications, such as furniture. This disclosure also relates to methods for making
   the units and methods for using them.
20                                     BACKGROUND
   [0002]       Modular units can be used to build a variety of structures. For example,
   modular concrete units have been used to build walls for more than a hundred years.
   In recent years, concrete units have been specifically designed for use in building
25 mortarless landscaping walls (in particular retaining walls that present one exposed
   face, or freestanding walls that present two, opposed, exposed faces). These units
   frequently include some form of locator arrangement to assist the installer in
   achieving the proper orientation of the blocks, and to help to brace the structure
   against earth pressure, wind pressure, and the like. In the DIY arena in particular,
30 there is a need for simple to use landscape wall - building units. Most of the DIY
   units that are in use today are sold through retail home center outlets, where shelf
   space is at a premium and, therefore, managing the number of SKU' s (stock keeping
   units) that are carried in the store is a significant factor.
                                                 1

   [00031        Modular units can be used in other capacities, such as for furniture
   including, for example, book shelves, stands, pedestals, etc.
   [0004]        Accordingly, there is a demand for easy-to-use modular units. The
   modular units can be for a variety of applications. Among the applications include,
 5 for example, landscape wall-building blocks that can perform multiple landscape
   wall and edging functions, and that provide the ornamental features that are
   important in that arena.
10                                         SUMMARY
   [0005]        A multi-use building block is provided. The multi-use block includes an
   elongate body having a length LI and a width WI. At least a first leg extends from
   a first side of the body with its center line perpendicular to the center line of the
   body. Each leg has a width W2 parallel to the length LI of the body and a length L2
15 perpendicular to the length LI of the body. Like blocks can be placed in different
   orientations with respect to each other to form multiple interlocking structures.
   [0006]         In another aspect, a method of making a multi-use concrete building
   block is provided. The method includes providing an elongate, pre-split body
   having a length 2LI and a width 2WI. At least a first and second leg extends from a
20 first side of the pre-split body with their center lines perpendicular to the center line
   of the pre-split body. Each leg has a width W2 parallel to the length 2LI of the pre
   split body and a length L2 perpendicular to the length 2LI of the pre-split body. At
   least a first and a second leg extend from a second side of the pre-split body opposite
   of the first side, with their center lines perpendicular to the center line of the pre
25 split body. Each leg has a width W2 parallel to the length 2LI of the pre-split body
   and a length L2 perpendicular to the length 2LI of the pre-split body. The upper and
   lower faces of the pre-split body are planar and parallel to each other. The method
   includes splitting the pre-split body along the width and along the length to result in
   four multi-use blocks, with each block having a body with a length LI and width
30 WI, a first split face, a second split face generally perpendicular to the first split
   face, and at least one leg extending from a side of the body opposite of the first split
   face, the leg having a width W2 parallel to the length LI of the body and a length L2
   perpendicular to the length LI of the body, so that when two of the blocks are placed
                                                 2

   end-to-end with their legs on the same side, a space is created between the adjacent
   legs of the two blocks for receiving the leg of a third like block.

   body. The upper and lower faces of the block are planar and parallel to each other.
10 The method includes placing the first block and second block end-to-end with their
   legs on the same side to form a space between the legs. The method includes
   orienting the third block to face the first block and second block to place the leg of
   the third block in the space formed between the adjacent legs of the first block and
   second block.

                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0096] A. The First Embodiment, FIGS. 1-13
   [0097]          (1) The Block, FIGS. 1-3
15 [00981       FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a first embodiment of a multi-use block
   30, constructed in accordance with the principles of this disclosure. The block 30 is
   shaped in a way to allow it many varied uses. The block 30 can be made out of a
   many different materials. When made of concrete, the block 30 can be used in
   freestanding walls and columns. The walls and columns can be made in many
20 different ways, some of which are described further below, to result in various
   aesthetically pleasing walls. The block 30 is made in a way to efficiently utilize
   materials and manufacturing techniques.
   [0099]       When used as a building block for walls and columns, for example,
   typically, the block 30 will be molded from dry cast concrete. However, it can be
25 made of wet cast concrete, plastic or other moldable material. The block 30 can be
   molded, as shown in FIG. 1, or it can be molded and then subject to manufacturing
   techniques to result in the block 30 shown in FIG. 1. Some preferred manufacturing
   methods will be described further below.
   [00100]      In other arrangements, the block 30, when utilized in, for example,
30 casual furniture arrangements can be made from non-concrete materials. The non
   concrete materials can include, for example, wood or plastic. Example plastics can
   include thermoset plastics, polystyrene, PVC; or other moldable material.
                                               13

   [00101]       The block 30 includes a block body 32. The block body 32 has a length
   LI (FIG. 2) and width WI (FIG. 2). In general, the body 32 will be elongate, in that
   the length LI will be greater than the width WI. The body 32 can be "generally
   rectangular." As used herein, the term "generally rectangular" can include shapes
 5 having 2 pairs of opposite sides that can deviate from being parallel, with the
   deviations being typically less than about +/- 15 degrees.
   [00102]       The block body 32 has a first side 34 and an opposite second side 36.
   Between the first side 34 and second side 36 are opposite first and second end faces
   38, 40. As will be explained further below, in some implementations and when the
10 block body 32 is made from concrete, the second side 36 will also be a first split
   face 42, and the first end face 38 will also be a second split face 44. By the term
   "split face", it is meant that the faces of the block are created as a result of a splitting
   process.
   [00103]       In some uses of the block 30, the second side 36 will be a front section
15 37 having a front face 39. In some structures, the front face 39 will be exposed
   when the block 30 is assembled with like blocks 30 in a structure. The first and
   second end faces 38, 40 extend rearwardly from the front face 39. The block 30
   will have a rear section 41 formed integrally with the front section 37.
   [00104]       The block 30 has an upper face 46 and an opposite lower face 48 (FIG.
20 2). In general, the upper face 46 and lower face 48 are planar and parallel to each
   other. The upper face 46 and lower face 48 include no protrusions or projections or
   indentations. In this example, the block 30 is free of through-holes or cores.
   [00105]       In FIG. 2, it can be seen how the second end face 40, which extends
   between the second side 36 and the first side 34, tapers inwardly as the end face 40
25 extends from the second side 36 to the first side 34. As used herein, the term
   "taper(s)" means generally to angle, so to "taper inwardly" means to be angled
   inwardly. In embodiments where the second side 36 is also the first split face 42,
   when the block 30 is made from concrete, the second end face 40 tapers inwardly as
   the second end face 40 extends from the first split face 42 to the first side 34. The
30 angle of taper 41 is typically less than 10 degrees.
   [00106]       The block 30 includes at least a first leg portion 49, which can be part of
   the rear section 41. The first leg portion 49 can include a first leg 50. The first leg
   50 extends from the first side 34 of the body 32. The leg 50 will have a center line
                                                 14

   52 that is generally perpendicular to the center line 54 of the body 32. The leg 50 is
   generally rectangular.
   [00107]       In FIG. 2, it can be seen that the first leg 50 has a width W2, which is
   parallel to the length LI of the body 32. The first leg 50 has a length L2 that is
 5 generally perpendicular to the length LI of the body 32.
   [00108]       The block 30 is shaped such that when two of the blocks 30 are placed
   end-to-end with their respective at least first leg 50 being pointed in the same
   direction (that is, on the same side), a space is created between the adjacent legs of
   the two blocks for receiving the generally rectangular leg 50 of a third like block.
10 This is described further below.
   [00109]       Still in reference to FIG. 2, the block 30 further includes a second
   generally rectangular leg 56. The second leg 56 has the same dimensions as the first
   leg 50. The second leg 56 also includes a center line 58 that is perpendicular to the
   center line 54 of the body 32.
15 [00110]       The second leg 56 is spaced from the first leg 50 to create a receiving
   space 60 between the legs 50, 56 for receiving one of the generally rectangular legs
   50 or 56 of a third like block 30.
   [00111]       In the embodiment of FIG. 2, the first leg 50 has a pair of opposite leg
   sides 62, 63. In preferred embodiments, the leg sides 62, 63 are tapered toward each
20 other as they extend away from the body 32, terminating at end leg face 64. The end
   leg face 64 is generally planar. The angle of the leg sides 62, 63, as measured
   relative to the direction of the length L2 can be less than 10 degrees, for example, 4
   8 degrees.
   [00112]       The second leg 56 has opposite leg sides 66, 67. Many embodiments
25 are possible, and in this example, the leg side 67 tapers in a direction toward the
   other leg side 66, while the leg side 66 is generally straight as it extends form the
   body 32. The leg side 67 can taper at an angle of less than 10 degrees, for example
   4-8 degrees.
   [00113]       Still in reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, the block 30 includes one of the legs
30 56 being at one end of the body 32. The first leg 50 is spaced from the second end
   face 40. The space between the first leg 50 and second end face 40 forms a
   receiving space 68 for receiving one of the legs 50, 56 of a like block 30.
                                                 15

   [00114]       Many different embodiments of the block 30 can be made. One
   example block 30 has a length LI of 11-12 inches, for example about 11.8 inches. It
   has a width WI of about 2.5-3.5 inches, for example about 3 inches. The leg width
   W2 is about 2-3 inches, for example about 2.6 inches. The receiving spaces 60, 68
 5 will be 2-3 inches, for example about 2.8-2.9 inches. The height HI (FIG. 3) will be
   about 3.5-4.5 inches, for example 4 inches.
   [00115]          (2) Method of Making the Block of FIGS. 1 and 2, FIG. 13
   [00116]       Before turning to various freestanding walls, columns, and other
   structures that can be made from the block 30, attention is directed to FIG. 13, which
10 illustrates one example method of making the block 30.
   [00117]       In FIG. 13, a pre-split body 70 is illustrated. The pre-split body 70 can
   be made by molding dry cast concrete. The pre-split body 70 has a length 2LI and a
   width 2WI and can be generally rectangular.
   [00118]       The pre-split body 70 includes a first side 72 and an opposite second
15 side 74. Extending between the first side 72 and second side 74 are opposite first
   and second end walls 76, 78.
   [00119]       In the example shown in FIG. 13, the first end wall 76 tapers from a
   center 80 inwardly as the end wall 76 extends from the center 80 to each of the first
   side 72 and second side 74. Similarly, the second end wall 78 tapers inwardly as it
20 extends from a center 82 to the first side 72 and second side 74.
   [00120]       The pre-split body 70 will have a generally planar upper face 84 and
   lower face. The upper face 84 and lower face will be generally parallel to each
   other. The pre-split body 70 can be free of through-holes or cores.
   [00121]       Still in reference to FIG. 13, at least a first leg 86 and second leg 88
25 extend from the first side 72 of the pre-split body 70. Each of the legs 86, 88 has a
   width W2 parallel to the length 2L1 of the pre-split body 70, and a length L2
   perpendicular to the length 2L1 of the pre-split body 70. The legs 86, 88 are
   generally rectangular.
   [00122]       The pre-split body 70 further includes at least a first leg 90 and a second
30 leg 92 extending from the second side 74 of the pre-split body 70. The first leg 90
   and second leg 92 will generally be the same size as the first leg 86 and second leg
   88, and have their center lines perpendicular to the center line of the pre-split body
   70. The legs 90, 92 can be generally rectangular.
                                                16

   [00123]       The pre-split body 70 also includes a third leg 94 extending from the
   first side 72 and a third leg 96 extending from the second side 74. In FIG. 13, the
   third leg 94 is between and spaced from the first leg 86 and second leg 88. The third
   leg 96 is between and spaced from the first leg 90 and second leg 92. The third legs
 5 94, 96 have center lines perpendicular to the center line of the pre-split body 70.
   The third legs 94, 96 have a width of twice the width of the first and second legs 86,
   88, 90, 92, which is a width of 2W2. The third legs 94, 96 are generally rectangular.
   [00124]       To make the block of FIG. 1, the method includes splitting the concrete
   pre-split body 70 along the length at splitting line 98 and along the width at splitting
10 line 100 to result in four multi-use blocks 30. The resulting four multi-use blocks 30
   will each have a body 32 with length LI and width WI, first split face 42, created
   along the splitting line 98 and second split face 44 created along the splitting line
    100. The second split face 44 will be generally perpendicular to the first split face
   42.
15 [00125]       The step of splitting can include, first, splitting the pre-split body along
   the splitting line 100, which is along the width 2W1, to result in a first and second
   split block, with each split block having a length of Li. After that step, then the first
   split block and second split block can be split along the splitting line 98, which is
   along the length LI, to result in the four multi-use blocks 30.
20 [00126]       The step of splitting along the width of the pre-split body 70 can also
   include splitting the pre-split body 70 along a center line 102, 103 of the third legs
   94, 96. In FIG. 13, the center line 102, 103 is the same line as the splitting line 100.
   [00127]       When the pre-split body 70 is made in the way described above, the
   result will be four multi-use blocks 30, having first split face 42, second split face 44
25 generally perpendicular to the first split face 42, and at least one generally
   rectangular leg 50, 56 extending from the side 34 opposite the first split face 42.
   [00128]       A variety of techniques for splitting the concrete pre-split body 70 can
   be used. In one example, the splitting can be done in accordance with U.S. Patent
   8,327,833 incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, a basic splitting process
30 can be used. For example, in one method, the step of splitting along the splitting
   line 100 across the width 2W1 uses a basic splitting technique, while the step of
   splitting along the split line 98 across the length is done in accordance with U.S.
   Patent 8,327,833.
                                                17

   [001291           Other methods of making the block 30 can include making the block
   30 with mold-textured faces as described in U.S. Patent 6,464,199, which is
   incorporated herein by reference. The block 30 can also have a sculpted face at 36,
   38 as described in U.S. Patent 7,140,867, which is incorporated herein by reference.
 5 [001301           (3) Example Structures, FIGS. 4-12
   [00131]       The block 30, when made of concrete, can be used to make a variety of
   walls, including freestanding walls, small retaining walls (garden walls), columns,
   edging walls, single course edging, and other structures. These structures can be
   made to have aesthetically pleasing exterior appearances.
10 [00132]       FIG. 4 illustrates one example column 106 that can be constructed from
   the block 30. FIG. 5 illustrates the top view of the column of FIG. 4. The column
    106 includes a plurality of courses 107 of the blocks 30. In the example shown,
   there are four blocks 30 in each course. In the top course, the four blocks 30 are
   shown at 108, 109, 110, and 111.
15 [00133]       It should be appreciated that the column 106 is formed so that the
   exterior surfaces are all either the first split face 42 or second split face 44, to give
   the column 106 an attractive exterior appearance. As can be seen in the drawings,
   the column 106 is formed by starting with one of the blocks, for example first block
    108, and then laying second block 109 adjacent to it, such that the end leg face 57 of
20 the second leg 56 abuts the second end face 40 of the first block 108. Also, the
   second split face 44 of the second block 109 will be aligned with the first split face
   42 of the first block 108. Next, the third block 110 is laid adjacent to the second
   block 109, such that the second split face 44 of the third block 110 is aligned with
   the first split face 42 of the second block 109 and the end leg face 57 of the third
25 block 110 abuts the second end face 40 of the second block 109. Finally, the fourth
   block 111 is placed in between the first block 108 and third block 110 and opposing
   the second block 109. The first split face 42 of the fourth block 111 will be laid so
   that it is next to and aligned with the second split face 44 of the first block 108. The
   second split face 44 of the fourth block 111 will be aligned with the first split face
30 42 of the third block 110. In adjacent courses 107 of the column 106 the blocks
   have opposite top face 46 or bottom face 48 facing upward so that the blocks in the
   column are not vertically aligned in adjacent courses.
                                                 18

   [00134]       FIG. 6 illustrates the top view of a combination column and freestanding
   wall at 114. The wall 114 abuts the column 106. The wall 114 is made from the
   blocks 30 in a nested formation 116. By "nested" it is meant that when two of the
   blocks 30 are placed end-to-end with their legs pointing in the same direction, a
 5 space is created between the adjacent legs of the two blocks and receives the leg of a
   third like block.
   [00135]       In FIG. 6, a first row of blocks is shown at 118, while a second row of
   blocks is shown at 120 opposing and nested with the first row 118. The first row
    118 includes blocks 121, 122, 123, 124 arranged end-to-end, such that the second
10 end face 40 of the block 121 is adjacent to the first end face 38 of the block 122, and
   the legs 50, 56 are pointing in the same direction, toward the second row 120.
   Similarly, the second end face 40 of the block 122 is adjacent to the first end face 38
   of the block 123, and the second end face 40 of the block 123 is adjacent to the first
   end face 38 of the block 124.
15 [00136]       When the blocks 121-124 are arranged as shown in the first row 118, the
   receiving spaces 60, 68 (FIG. 2) are created, to receive the legs 50, 56 from the
   blocks 125, 126, 127, 128 making up the second row 120. The blocks 125-128 are
   arranged end-to-end, as described for the first row 118. As can be seen in FIG. 6,
   the second leg 56 of the block 125 is received in the space 60 (FIG. 2) between the
20 first leg 50 and second leg 56 of the block 121. The first leg 50 is received in the
   space 68 (FIG. 2) of the block 121. This pattern continues throughout the wall 114.
   [001371        It should be noted that row 120 also includes a partial block section
    129. A splitting groove may be made across the upper or lower face 46, 48 of the
   block 30 to facilitate the splitting to form the block section 129, when one is needed.
25 [00138]       FIG. 7 illustrates a top view of another embodiment of a combination
   column 106 and wall 130, constructed from blocks 30 of FIG. 1. In this
   embodiment, the wall 130 is a non-nested wall, in which the end leg faces 57, 64
   abut each other.
   [00139]       In FIG. 7, the wall includes a first row 132 opposed to a second row 134.
30 The first row includes blocks 136, 137, 138, 139 made according to the block 30 of
   FIG. 1. The second row 134 includes blocks 140, 141, 142, 143, also made
   according to the block 30 of FIG. 1. The blocks 136-139 of the first row 132 are
   arranged end to end, so that the first split face 42 of each block is aligned with the
                                                19

   next adjacent block. The second end face 40 of the block 136 abuts against the first
   end face 38 of the block 137. Similarly, the second end face 40 of the block abuts
   the first end face 38 of the block 138. Similarly, the second end face 40 of the block
    138 abuts the first end face 38 of the block 139.
 5 [00140]      The second row 134 is arranged similarly as the first row 132, with
   respective end faces 40, 38 abutting each other, while the first split face 42 of each
   of the blocks 140-143 is aligned with the next adjacent block.
   [00141]      When arranged in this manner, the first leg 50 of each of the blocks 136
    139 is opposed to and abuts one of the first legs 50 of the blocks 140-143.
10 Similarly, the second leg 56 of each of the blocks 136-139 is opposed to and against
   one of the second legs 56 of each of the blocks 140-143.
   [00142]      FIG. 8 illustrates a top view of another embodiment of a combination
   column 106 and wall 146. The wall 146 in FIG. 8 is a curved wall 146. The taper of
   the second end face 40 allows for the blocks 30 to be arranged in curves without
15 exposing any gaps between the blocks 30.
   [00143]      In FIG. 8, a first row 148 of blocks 30 is shown opposed to a second row
    150 of blocks 30. In each of the rows, the blocks 30 are arranged adjacent to each
   other so that the respective first split face 42 of each block 30 is adjacent to and in
   alignment with the first split face 42 of the next adjacent block 30.
20 [00144]      As can be seen in FIG. 8, the first row 148 forms a curve so that the
   outside curve is formed by the first split face 42. In that first row 148, the second
   end face 40 of each of the blocks 30 is engaged completely against the first end face
   38, so that there are no gaps between them. Because of the taper on the second end
   face 40, when the first end face 38 of the next adjacent block 30 is pressed against it,
25 a curve is formed along the first row 148 on the edge formed by the adjacent first
   split faces 42.
   [00145]      The second row 150 is arranged to be opposing the first row 148. The
   second end face 40 of one of the blocks 30 is adjacent to the first end face 38 of the
   next adjacent block 30 so that at least the adjacent corners are touching. To form a
30 curve in the second row 150, the gap between adjacent second end faces 40 and first
   end faces 38 is not visible from outside of the wall. This forms the inside curve of
   the second row 150 along the first split faces 42 of the adjacent blocks 30.
                                                20

   [00146]      FIG. 9 is a perspective view of another wall 152 that can be constructed
   from blocks 30 of FIG.1. The wall 152 is a non-nested waffle face wall 154. The
   waffle face wall 154 is constructed by placing two rows 156, 158 of blocks 30 so
   that the second side 36 of each block 30 in the row 156 is against the second side 36
 5 of each block 30 in the row 158. This results in the legs 50, 56 of each of the blocks
   30 being directed outwardly, to be visible from the exterior of the wall 152. In the
   example shown in FIG. 9, the waffle face wall 154 has five courses with the blocks
   30 of each course offset from the adjacent course by the width of one of the legs, 50,
   56.
10 [00147]      FIG. 10 is a perspective view of a wall 160 including the waffle faced
   wall 154 adjacent the column 106. The wall 160 is finished with cap blocks 162,
   which cover the top of both of the opposing rows 156, 158.
   [00148]      FIG. 11 is a perspective view of a mixed face wall 164 constructed from
   the blocks 30. In this embodiment, the wall 164 includes a combination of both the
15 wall 130 of FIG. 7 and the waffle faced wall 154 of FIG. 9. Many combinations are
   possible. In the example shown in FIG. 11, the bottom three courses 165 of the
   mixed face wall 164 is a wall 130 as shown in FIG. 7, in which the exterior
   appearance is relatively planar, with the first split face 42 of each of the blocks 30
   being visible. The top two courses of the wall 164 are the waffle face 154, in which
20 the legs 50, 56 are visible. Cap blocks 162 form the upper surface of the wall 164
   and cover both opposing rows in the mixed face wall 164. The column 106 is
   adjacent and against the mixed face wall 164.
   [00149]      The block 30 can be used for making a small retaining wall (a garden
   wall). FIG. 12 shows a top view of three of the blocks 30 of FIG. 1 oriented in a
25 configuration to form a retaining wall having a setback. The blocks 30 can be
   stacked in successive courses with a running bond and typically with some batter,
   which is a gradual upward and backward slope to assist the wall in resisting forces
   exerted on it by the retained soil. A setback can be used with each block 30 to assist
   in forming the desired batter.
30 [00150]      Preferably, the block 30 includes no lips, tongues, "dogbones" or other
   integral "positive-interference" setback-establishing configurations. That is, the
   preferred block 30 is lip-free, tongue-free, dogbone-free, and other positive
   interference-free. In lieu thereof, the block 30 includes a visual setback indicator
                                               21

    166. In general, the visual setback indicator 166 helps to guide the construction of a
   retaining wall to have a desired setback distance for successive courses of blocks in
   a wall constructed with the blocks 30.
   [00151]      In order to be easily used, the visual setback indicator 166 is on the
 5 upper face 46 of the block 30 and is so located as to provide a reference in relation
   to the lower front edge 43 (FIG. 1) of the block(s) 30 to be laid on the upper face 46.
   In contemplated embodiments, the visual setback indicators are easily visible to the
   installer during the installation process, and are located relative to each other so as to
   indicate the proper setback to the installer. Because most walls are built with a
10 "running bond" pattern, the visual setback indicator includes visual portions on the
   upper face 46 near the edges where the upper face 46 meets the first and second end
   faces 38, 40.
   [00152]      A variety of embodiments for the visual setback indicator 166 are
   contemplated. In FIG. 12, the visual setback indicator 166 is shown as extending
15 only partially across the upper face 46 in two sections 167, 168. The section 167
   extends on the upper face 46 from the first end face 38. The second section 168
   extends on the upper face 46 from the second end face 40. In this embodiment, the
   first and second sections 167, 168 are each less than one-third of the entire width
   across the upper face 46 at the location of the visual setback indicator 166.

   [00153]      B. The Second Embodiment of a Multi-Use Block, FIGS. 14-21
   [00154]          (1) The Block, FIGS. 14 and 15
   [00155]       The second embodiment of a multi-use building block is illustrated in
   FIG. 14 at 170. Like the block of the first embodiment, the block 170 can be made
25 of many different types of materials. When used as a block for construction of , e.g.,
   walls and columns, it is typically made of concrete, preferably dry cast concrete but
   it can be made of wet cast concrete. The block 170 includes a body 172 having a
   length LI and a width W 1. The length LI is longer than the width W 1, so that the
   body 172 is elongate. The body 172 is "generally rectangular," as previously
30 defined.
   [00156]       In other arrangements, the block 170, when utilized in, for example,
   casual furniture arrangements can be made from non-concrete materials. The non
   concrete materials can include, for example, wood or plastic. Example plastics can
                                               22

   include thermoset plastics, polystyrene, PVC; or other moldable material.In the
   embodiment of FIG. 14, the body 172 includes opposite first and second sides 174,
    176, and opposite first and second end faces 178, 180 extending there between.
   [00157]       As characterized herein, the body 172 is tapered, in that it is longer at
 5 second side 176 than first side 174. In section (4) below, alternate characterizations
   of the body 172 are discussed. This taper can be achieved by setting one or both of
   the end faces 178, 180 at an angle 181 to the second side 176. The second end face
    180 extends inwardly as it extends from the second side 176 to the first side 174.
   The angle 181 of the second end face 180 relative to the second side 176 will be less
10 than 10 degrees, for example about 8 degrees. In this embodiment, the body 172 is
   tapered inwardly from end faces 178, 180 toward a leg 192, which will be explained
   further below.
   [00158]       In some methods of making the block 170, the resulting second side 176
   will be a first split face 184, and the first end face 178 will be a second split face
15  186. An example method of making will be described further below in connection
   with FIG. 21.
   [00159]       In some uses of the block 170, the second side 176 will be a front
   section having a front face 179. In some structures, the front face 179 will be
   exposed when the block 170 is assembled with like blocks 170 in a structure. The
20 first and second end faces 178, 180 extend rearwardly from the front face 179. The
   block 170 will have a rear section 183 formed integrally with the front section 177.
   [00160]       The block 170 further includes an upper face 188 and a lower face 190
   (FIG. 14). Preferably, the upper face 188 and lower face 190 are generally planar
   and parallel to each other. In this example, the block 170 is free of through-holes or
25 cores, although it could be made with such voids.
   [00161]       The block 170 includes at least a first leg portion 191, which can be part
   of the rear section 183. The first leg portion 191 is leg 192. As characterized
   herein, the leg 192 extends from the first side 174 of the body 172. Alternate
   definitions are included in section (4) below. The leg 192 is generally rectangular,
30 but in preferred embodiments, deviates from a rectangular shape as can be seen in
   FIG. 14. The leg 192 includes opposite leg sides 194, 195. The opposite leg sides
    194, 195 extend between an end leg face 196 and the first side 174 of the body 172.
   In this embodiment, the leg sides 194, 195 are angled (or tapered) away from each
                                                 23

   other as they extend away from the body 172 and toward the end leg face 196. The
   angle is shown at 198 for leg side 194 and is less than 10 degrees, for example,
   about 4 degrees.      The leg side 195 is also angled at angle 199, which is the same
   angle as angle 198.
 5 [00162]       The end leg face 196 includes a recessed portion. For example, the end
   leg face 196 has a section 196a recessed inwardly from the leg side 194 at an angle
   200 of less than 10 degrees, for example about 4 degrees. Similarly, the end leg face
    106 has a section 196b recessed inwardly from leg side 195 at angle 201, which is
   the same angle as angle 200.
10 [00163]       The leg 192 has a center line 202 which is perpendicular to the center
   line 204 of the body 172. The leg 192 has a width W2, which is parallel to the
   length LI of the body 172. The width W2 is the widest portion of the leg 192,
   measured at the end leg face 196, in this embodiment. Further, the leg 192 includes
   a length L2, perpendicular to the length LI of the body 172. The length L2 is the
15 greatest length of the first leg 192, as measured from the body 172 to an end point of
   one of the leg sides 194, 195.
   [00164]       The leg 192 of the block 170 is the only leg on the block 170. In this
   example, the leg 192 is spaced from each of the first end face 178 and second end
   face 180.
20 [00165]       In the embodiment shown in FIG. 14, the leg 196 is spaced from the
   first end face a distance D1, and spaced from the second end face 180 a distance D2,
   in which D1 is greater than D2.
   [00166]       Still in reference to FIG. 14, the first side 174 includes first portion 206,
   which is between the first end face 178 and the leg side 194. This first portion 206
25 is at a non-perpendicular angle 208 relative to the first end face 178 and to the leg
   side 194. For example, the angle 208 between first portion 206 and first end face
    178 is less than 90 degrees, for example about 86 degrees. As can be seen, the first
   portion 206 of the first side 174 angles inwardly (i.e., tapers inwardly) as it extends
   from the first end face 178 to the leg side 194.
30 [00167]       Similarly, the first side 174 has a second portion 210. The second
   portion 210 extends between the second end face 180 and the leg side 195. The
   second portion 210, in this example, is angled at a non-perpendicular angle 212
   between the second end face 180 and the second portion 210. The angle 212 will be
                                                 24

   greater than 90 degrees, for example about 94 degrees. As can be seen, the second
   portion 210 tapers inwardly at an angle 182 as it extends from the second end face
    180 to the leg side 195. The angle 182 will be less than 10 degrees, for example,
   about 4 degrees.
 5 [00168]       The angle 198 of the leg side 194, the angle 200 of the end leg face
   section 196a, the angle 198 of leg side 195, the angle 200 of the end leg face section
    196b and the angle 182 of the second side portion 210 are the same. These
   relationships are helpful when constructing a column 252 (FIGS. 16 and 17) to help
   lock the blocks 170 together to prevent any one of the blocks 170 from moving
10 laterally relative to the others. There is a similar locking relationship between
   second portion 210 of the first side 174 and the leg side 194. A steady, linear taper
   shown by angles 182, 198 and 200 can also be stepped or curvilinear to be helpful in
   resisting pullout of the leg 192 from between two adjacent units in the same course.
   [00169]       In one useful example, the block 170 will have a length LI of less than
15  13 inches, for example about 11.8-12 inches. The width WI will be 3-4 inches, for
   example about 3.6 inches. The length L2 will be less than 4 inches, for example
   about 2.8-3 inches. The length of D1 will be between 3 and 4 inches, for example
   about 3.4 inches, while the length of D2 will be less than 3 inches, for example
   about 2-2.1 inches. The angle 214 will be about 90 degrees, while the angle 216 will
20 be about 82 degrees. The angles 218 and 220 will each be about 82 degrees. The
   height between the upper face 188 and lower face 190 will be less than 5 inches, for
   example about 4 inches.
   [001701          (2) Example Method, FIG. 21
   [00171]       Before turning to various freestanding walls, columns, and other
25 structures that can be made with the block 170, attention is directed to FIG. 21,
   which illustrates one method for making the block 170, when made from concrete.
   In FIG. 21, a pre-split body is shown at 224. The pre-split body 224 can be made as
   a result of molding dry cast concrete. The pre-split body 224 has a length 2L1 and a
   width 2W1 and, the pre-split body 224 (without the legs 240, 242, 244, 246) is
30 generally rectangular.
   [00172]       The pre-split body 224 includes a first side 226 and an opposite second
   side 228. Extending between the first side 226 and second side 228 are opposite
   first and second end walls 230, 232.
                                               25

   [00173]        In the example shown in FIG. 21, the first end wall 230 tapers from a
   center 234 inwardly as the end wall 230 extends from the center 234 to each of the
   first side 226 and second side 228. Similarly, the second end wall 232 tapers
   inwardly as it extends from a center 236 to the first side 226 and second side 228.
 5 [00174]        The pre-split body 224 will have a generally planar upper face 238 and
   lower face. The upper face 238 and lower face will be generally parallel to each
   other.
   [00175]        Still in reference to FIG. 21, at least a first leg 240 and second leg 242
   extend from the first side 226 of the pre-split body 224. Each of the legs 240, 242
10 has a width W2 parallel to the length 2L1 of the pre-split body 224, and a length L2
   perpendicular to the length 2L1 of the pre-split body 224. The legs 240, 242 are
   generally rectangular.
   [00176]        The pre-split body 224 further includes a first leg 244 and second leg
   246 extending from the second side 228 of the pre-split body 224. The first leg 244
15 and second leg 246 will generally be the same size as the first leg 240 and second
   leg 242 and have their center lines perpendicular to the center line of the pre-split
   body 224.
   [00177]        To make the block 170 of FIG. 14, the method includes splitting the
   concrete pre-split body 224 along the length at splitting line 248 and along the width
20 at splitting line 250 to result in four multi-use blocks 170 (FIG. 14). The resulting
   four multi-use blocks 170 will each have a body 172 with length LI and width WI,
   and first split face 184, created along the splitting line 248 and second split face 186
   created along the splitting line 250. The second split face 186 will be generally
   perpendicular to the first split face 184.
25 [00178]        The step of splitting can include, first, splitting the pre-split body 224
   along the splitting line 250, which is along the width 2W1, to result in a first and
   second split block, with each split block having a length of one-half of 2L 1, which
   would be LI. After that step, then the first split block and second split block can be
   split along the splitting line 248, which is along the length LI, to result in the four
30 multi-use blocks 170.
   [00179]        A variety of techniques for splitting the pre-split body 224 can be used.
   For example, in one method, the step of splitting along the splitting line 250 across
   the width 2W 1 uses a basic splitting technique, while the step of splitting along the
                                                 26

   split line 248 across the length is done in accordance with U.S. Patent 8,327,833,
   which is incorporated herein by reference.
   [001801           (3) Structures Made with the Embodiment of FIGS. 14-15: FIGS.
    16-20
 5 [00181]        The block 170, when made from concrete, can be used to make a variety
   of freestanding walls, garden walls, edging walls, single course edging, columns,
   and other structures. The structures can be made to have aesthetically pleasing
   exterior appearances.
   [00182]        FIG. 16 illustrates one example column 252 that can be constructed
10 from the block 170. FIG. 17 shows a top view of the column of FIG. 16. The
   column 252 includes a plurality of courses 254 of the blocks 170. In the example
   shown, there are four blocks 170 in each course 254. In the top course, the four
   blocks 170 are shown at 256, 257, 258, and 259.
   [00183]        The column 252 is formed so that the exterior surfaces are all either the
15 first split face 184 or second split face 186, to give the column 252 an attractive
   exterior appearance.
   [00184]        In one example, the column 252 is formed by starting with one of the
   blocks, for example the first block 256, and then laying the second block 257
   adjacent to it, such that the second split face 186 of the block 257 is in alignment
20 with the first split face 184 of the first block 256. The second end face 180 of the
   block 256 will abut the first portion 206 of the first side 174 of the block 257. Next,
   the third block 258 is laid adjacent to the second block 257, such that the second
   split face 186 of the third block 258 is adjacent and in alignment with the first split
   face 184 of the second block 257. The second end face 180 of the second block 257
25 abuts the first portion 206 of the third block 258. The third block 258 is generally
   opposite the first block 256. Finally, the fourth block 259 is laid between the first
   block 256 and the third block 258, such that the second split face 186 of the fourth
   block 259 is adjacent and in alignment with the first split face 184 of the third block
   258. Because of the angles of the sides 194 and 195 of the leg 192, the fourth block
30 259 must be moved into the position illustrated in FIG. 16 from above the other
   blocks. The first split face 184 of the fourth block 259 is then adjacent and in
   alignment with the second split face 186 of the first block 256. The first portion 206
   of the fourth block 259 abuts the second end face 180 of the third block 258.
                                                 27

   Further, the second end face 180 of the fourth block 259 abuts the first portion 206
   of the first block 256. The angles 198 of the leg sides 194 and 195 of each block
   256-259 are the same as the angles 182 of the second portion 210 and the angles 200
   of each section 196a, 196b of the end leg face 196. As a result, when the blocks
 5 256-259 are placed as illustrated in FIG. 16, they lock the four blocks 256-259
   together so they cannot be moved laterally. Optionally, the courses can be glued
   together with a suitable adhesive, to increase the stability and integrity of the
   structure.
   [00185]        FIG. 18 illustrates the top view of a combination column 252 and
10 freestanding wall 262. The wall 262 is abuts the column 252. The wall 262 is made
   from the blocks 170 in a nested formation 264. By "nested" it is meant that when
   two of the blocks 170 are placed end-to-end with their legs 192 pointing in the same
   direction, a space is created between the adjacent legs 192 of the two blocks, which
   receives the leg 192 of a third like block.
15 [00186]        In FIG. 18, a first row of blocks is shown at 266, while a second row of
   blocks 268 is shown opposing and nested with the first row of blocks 266. The first
   row of blocks 266 includes blocks 270, 271, 272, and 273 arranged end-to-end, such
   that the first split face 184 of each of the blocks is adjacent and in alignment with the
   first split face 184 of the next adjacent block to form a generally straight line. It
20 should be noted that row 266 also includes a half block 274. A splitting groove may
   be made across the middle of the upper or lower face 188, 190 of the block 170 to
   facilitate the splitting to form the half block 274 when one is needed. The second
   end face 180 of each block 170 abuts the first end face 178 of the adjacent block.
   [00187]        When the blocks 270-273 and half block 274 are arranged end-to-end, in
25 the first row 266, receiving spaces 276 are created to receive the legs 192 of blocks
   278, 279, 280, 281 making up the second row 268. The blocks 278-281 are arranged
   end-to-end, as described for the first row 266.
   [00188]        As can be seen in FIG. 18, the leg 192 of the block 278 is received
   within the receiving space 276 between blocks 274 and 270. The leg 192 of the
30 block 270 is received in the receiving space 276 between blocks 278 and 279. The
   leg 192 of the block 271 is received within the receiving space 276 between the
   blocks 279 and 280. The pattern continues throughout the wall 262. In the wall
   264, the angled leg sides 194 and 195 of a block interlock with the angled leg sides
                                                 28

    194, 195 of two other blocks on the opposite side of the wall 262 and prevent the
   block from being pulled out laterally.
   [00189]       FIG. 19 is a perspective view of another wall 280 that can be
   constructed from the blocks 170 of FIG. 14. The wall 280 is a non-nested waffle
 5 face wall 282. The waffle face wall 282 is constructed by placing two rows 284,
   285 of the blocks 170 so that the second side 176 of each block 170 in the row 284
   abuts the second side 176 of the block 170 in the row 285. This results in the legs
    192 of each of the blocks 170 being directed outwardly, to be visible from the
   exterior of the wall 280. In the example shown in FIG. 19, the waffle face wall 282
10 has five courses.
   [00190]      The block 170 can be used for making a small retaining wall (a garden
   wall). FIG. 20 shows a top view of three of the blocks 170 of FIG. 14 oriented in a
   configuration to form a retaining wall having a setback. The blocks 170 can be
   stacked in successive courses with a running bond and typically with some batter,
15 which is a gradual upward and backward slope to assist the wall in resisting forces
   exerted on it by the retained soil. A setback can be used with each block 170 to
   assist in forming the desired batter.
   [00191]      Preferably, the block 170 includes no lips, tongues, "dogbones" or other
   integral "positive-interference" setback-establishing configurations. That is, the
20 preferred block 170 is lip-free, tongue-free, dogbone-free, and other positive
   interference-free. In lieu thereof, the block 170 includes a visual setback indicator
   286. In general, the visual setback indicator 286 helps to guide the construction of a
   retaining wall to have a desired setback distance for successive courses of blocks in
   a wall constructed with the blocks 170.
25 [00192]      In order to be easily used, the visual setback indicator 286 is on the
   upper face 188 of the block 170 and is so located as to provide a reference in relation
   to a lower front edge of the block(s) 170 to be laid on the upper face 188. In
   contemplated embodiments, the visual setback indicators are easily visible to the
   installer during the installation process, and are located relative to each other so as to
30 indicate the proper setback to the installer. Because most walls are built with a
   "running bond" pattern, the visual setback indicator includes visual portions on the
   upper face 188 near the edges where the upper face 188 meets the first and second
   end faces 178, 180.
                                               29

   [001931          A variety of embodiments for the visual setback indicator 286 are
   contemplated. In FIG. 20, the visual setback indicator 286 is shown as extending
   only partially across the upper face 188 in two sections 287, 288. The section 287
   extends on the upper face 188 from the first end face 178. The second section 288
 5 extends on the upper face 188 from the second end face 180. In this embodiment,
   the first and second sections 287, 288 are each less than one-third of the entire width
   across the upper face 188 at the location of the visual setback indicator 286.
   [00194]          (4) Additional Observations re the Embodiment of FIGS. 14-21
10 [00195]       In addition to the characterizations above, additional observations
   and/or alternate definitions regarding the block 170 embodiment of FIGS. 14-21 are
   included herein.
   [00196]       Referring to FIG. 14, the block body 172 includes opposite first and
   second sides 174, 176, and opposite first and second end faces 178, 180 extending
15 therebetween.
   [00197]       The body 172 further has opposite first and second bearing faces 401,
   402 (FIG. 15). The first and second bearing faces 401, 402 extend between the first
   and second sides 174, 176 and between the first and second end faces 178, 180. In
   normal use, when the block 170 is used for construction of structures such as
20 freestanding walls, garden walls, edging walls, single course edging, columns, etc.,
   the first bearing face 401 is the upper face 188 in use. The second bearing face 402
   is the lower face 190.
   [00198]       The first bearing face 401 has a contact surface portion 404. The
   contact surface portion 404 is the part of the first bearing face 401 that is in touching
25 engagement with a like block 170 stacked on the first bearing face 401. In one or
   more example embodiments, the contact surface portion 404 is the outermost
   projecting part of the first bearing face 401. In preferred embodiments, the contact
   surface portion 404 is generally planar. By "generally planar", it is meant that the
   surface forms a plane but can have some minor deviations.
30 [00199]       The second bearing face 402 has a contact surface portion 405. The
   contact surface portion 405 is the part of the second bearing face 402 that is in
   touching engagement with either the ground or with the contact surface portion 404
   of the first bearing face 401 of the like block 170, when stacked on the first bearing
                                               30

   face 401 of the like block 170. In one or more example embodiments, the contact
   surface portion 404 is the outermost projecting part of the second bearing face 402.
   In preferred embodiments, the contact surface portion 405 is generally planar. In
   one or more example embodiments, the contact surface portion 404 of the first
 5 bearing face 401 and the contact surface portion 405 of the second bearing face 402
   are generally parallel to each other.
   [00200]       The second side 176 of the body 172 has first and second opposite ends
   406, 407. The second side 176 defines a second side center plane 410 that is
   generally orthogonal to the first and second bearing faces 401, 402.
10 [00201]       An end face center plane 411 that is generally orthogonal to the first and
   second bearing faces 401, 402 extends between the end faces 178, 180. The end
   face center plane 411 is generally orthogonal to the second side center plane 410. In
   one or more embodiments, the end face center plane 411 contains the centerline 204
   of the body 172.
15 [00202]       In reference again to FIG. 14, the first side 174 of the body 172 defines
   leg 192. As such, the first side 174 of the body has the opposite leg sides 194, 195
   and leg end face 196. The leg side 194 corresponds to a first leg side 408, while the
   opposite leg side 195 corresponds to second leg side 409. The leg end face 196
   extends between the first leg side 408 and second leg side 409.
20 [00203]       The first side 174 of the body 172 has the first portion 206. The first
   portion 206 extends between the first end face 178 and the first leg side 408.
   [00204]       Preferably, the first portion 206 is angled at a first extension angle 412
   away from the second side 176 of the body 172, as the first portion 206 extends from
   the first leg side 408 to the first end face 178, the first extension angle 412 being
25 non-zero. By the term, "extension angle", it is meant the angle measured when a
   straight line is drawn between endpoints, here the endpoints being: (i) the
   "intersection" of the first leg side 408 and first portion 206, and (ii) the
   "intersection" of the first end face 178 and first portion 206; but "extension angle"
   does not require the surface (here, the first portion 206) between the end points to be
30 straight or planar. Rather, the surface between the end points can be curved, jagged,
   indented, protruding, etc. As used herein, by the term "intersection", it is meant the
   midpoint between the joining surfaces, such that if the intersection is radiused, the
   endpoint is taken at the midpoint of the radius.
                                                31

   [00205]       The first extension angle 412 is measured relative to a line parallel to the
   end face center plane 411. The first extension angle 412 can be less than 10 degrees
   in some embodiments; less than 9 degrees in some embodiments; less than 8 degrees
   in some embodiments; less than 7 degrees in some embodiments; less than 6 degrees
 5 in some embodiments; less than 5 degrees in some embodiments. The first
   extension angle 412 can be greater than 1 degree in some embodiments; greater than
   2 degrees in some embodiments; greater than 3 degrees is some embodiments; and
   greater than 4 degrees in some embodiments. In one or more example embodiments,
   the first extension angle 412 can be 2-7 degrees; and in one or more example
10 embodiments, the first extension angle 412 can be 3-5 degrees. In one or more
   example embodiments, the first extension angle 412 can be about 4 degrees.
   [00206]       The first side 174 of the body 172 has the second portion 210 extending
   between the second end face 180 and the second leg side 409.
   [00207]       Preferably, the second portion 210 is "angled" at a second extension
15 angle, also corresponding to the angle 182 shown in FIG. 14, away from the second
   side 176 of the body 172, as the second portion 210 extends from the second leg side
   409 to the second end face 180, the second extension angle 182 being non-zero. As
   above, the term, "extension angle", means the angle measured when a straight line is
   drawn between endpoints, here the endpoints being: (i) the intersection of the second
20 leg side 409 and second portion 210, and (ii) the intersection of the second end face
    180 and second portion 210; but "extension angle" does not require the surface
   (here, the second portion 210) between the end points to be straight or planar.
   [00208]       The second extension angle 182 is measured relative to a line parallel to
   the end face center plane 411. The second extension angle 182 can be about equal to
25 or different from the first extension angle 412. The second extension angle 182 can
   be less than 10 degrees in some embodiments; less than 9 degrees in some
   embodiments; less than 8 degrees in some embodiments; less than 7 degrees in some
   embodiments; less than 6 degrees in some embodiments; less than 5 degrees in some
   embodiments. The second extension angle 182 can be greater than 1 degree in some
30 embodiments; greater than 2 degrees in some embodiments; greater than 3 degrees is
   some embodiments; and greater than 4 degrees in some embodiments. In one or
   more example embodiments, the second extension angle 182 can be 2-7 degrees; and
   in one or more example embodiments, the second extension angle 182 can be 3-5
                                               32

   degrees. In one or more example embodiments, the second extension angle 182 can
   be about 4 degrees.
   [00209]       The leg 192 is preferably narrower proximal the first portion 206 and
   second portion 210 of the first side 174 of the body 172 than at the leg end face 196.
 5 By the term "narrower", it is meant that: (i) a greatest distance between the first leg
   side 408 and second leg side 409 is less at the location where the leg 192 projects
   from the first portion 206 and second portion 210 than (ii) a greatest distance
   between the first leg side 408 and second leg side 409 at (adjacent to) the leg end
   face 196.
10 [00210]       Alternately phrased, the leg 192 is narrower at its proximal end than at
   its distal end 419. The proximal end is closer to the second side 176 of the body 172
   than the distal end 419, and the distal end 419 defines a free end 420 of the leg 192.
   The free end 420 of the leg 192 defines the leg end face 196. The proximal end of
   the leg 192 is the part of the leg that projects from the first portion 206 and second
15 portion 210.
   [00211]       In preferred embodiments, the leg 192 has a widest portion 418 being at
   the leg end face 196. By "widest", it is meant that (i) a shortest distance between the
   first leg side 408 and second leg side 409 at (adjacent to) the leg end face 196 is
   greater than (ii) a shortest distance between the first leg side 408 and second leg side
20 409 along any other part of the leg 192.
   [00212]       The leg 192 has a center plane 416 that is generally orthogonal to the
   first and second bearing faces 401, 402. The center plane 416, in one or more
   example embodiments, can bisect the leg 192. In FIG. 14, the center plane 416
   contains the leg center line 202.
25 [00213]       As can be seen in FIG. 14, the leg 192 extends generally transverse to a
   remaining portion of the body 172. By "transverse", it is meant the center plane 416
   of the leg 192 crosses the end face center plane 411. While the center plane 416 of
   the leg 192 need not be orthogonal to the end face center plane 411, in one or more
   example embodiments, the leg center plane 416 is orthogonal to the end face center
30 plane 411.
   [00214]       An example of the leg 192 being narrower proximal the first portion 206
   and second portion 210 includes the first leg side 408 diverging from the second leg
   side 409, as the first leg side 408 extends away from the first portion 206 of the first
                                                33

   side 174 of the body 172. In one or more example embodiments, the first leg side
   408 extends away from the first portion 206 at a third extension angle,
   corresponding to angle 198 in FIG. 14, relative to the leg center plane 416. The
   third extension angle 198 will be non-zero. The term "extension angle" is as used
 5 above, and refers to measurement of a line drawn between endpoints. In this case,
   the endpoints are at the intersection of: (i) first portion 206 and first leg side 408;
   and (ii) first leg side 408 and leg end face 196. The term "extension angle" does not
   require the surface between the end points to be straight or planar.
   [00215]       An extension angle 198a is also illustrated as being the extension angle
10 of the first leg side 408 extending from leg end face 196 to the first portion 206. The
   extension angle 198a will be the same measurement as the third extension angle 198.
   [00216]       The second leg side 409 diverges from the first leg side 408, as the
   second leg side 409 extends away from the second portion 210 of the first side 174
   of the body 172. In one or more example embodiments, the second leg side 409
15 extends away from the second portion 210 at a fourth extension angle 199 in FIG.
    14, relative to the leg center plane 416. The fourth extension angle 199 will be non
   zero. The term "extension angle" is as used above, and refers to measurement of a
   line drawn between endpoints. In this case, the endpoints are at the intersection of:
   (i) second portion 206 and second leg side 409, and (ii) second leg side 409 and leg
20 end face 196; although, again, as stated above, "extension angle" does not require
   the surface between the end points to be straight or planar.
   [00217]       An extension angle 199a is also illustrated as being the extension angle
   of the second leg side 409 extending from leg end face 196 to the second portion
   409. The extension angle 199a will be the same measurement as the fourth
25 extension angle 199.
   [00218]       The third extension angle 198 and fourth extension angle 199 can be
   equal to each other or different from each other. The third extension angle 198 and
   the fourth extension angle 199 can be less than 10 degrees in some embodiments;
   less than 9 degrees in some embodiments; less than 8 degrees in some embodiments;
30 less than 7 degrees in some embodiments; less than 6 degrees in some embodiments;
   less than 5 degrees in some embodiments. The third extension angle 198 and fourth
   extension angle 199 can be greater than 1 degree in some embodiments; greater than
   2 degrees in some embodiments; greater than 3 degrees is some embodiments; and
                                                34

   greater than 4 degrees in some embodiments. In one or more example embodiments,
   the third extension angle 198 and fourth extension angle 199 can be 2-7 degrees; and
   in one or more example embodiments, the third extension angle 198 and fourth
   extension angle 199 can be 3-5 degrees. In one or more example embodiments, the
 5 third extension angle 198 and fourth extension angle 199 can be about 4 degrees.
   [00219]       The leg end face 196 defines a recess 422. The recess 422 can be useful
   when arranging the blocks 170 together to form columns 252.
   [00220]       Preferably, the recess 422 is in complete extension between the first and
   second bearing faces 401, 402. The recess 422 extends inwardly toward the
10 remaining portion of the block 170. Alternately phrased, the recess 422 extends
   inward toward the second side 176 of the body 172.
   [00221]       In preferred embodiments, the recess 422 extends at least partially
   between the first leg side 408 and second leg side 409. By "at least partially", it is
   meant that the recess 422 is not required to be in complete extension between the
15 first leg side 408 and second leg side 409. For example, the recess 422 can start at
   the first leg side 408 and extend only part of the way to the second leg side 409 by
   stopping short of meeting the second leg side 409; or vice-versa, by starting at the
   second leg side 409 and extending only part of the way to the first leg side 408); or
   the recess 422 can extend at any location along the leg end face 196 and not extend
20 fully to the first leg side 408 or second leg side 409. In one example, the recess 422
   can extend by starting at one of the first leg side 408 or second leg side 409 and stop
   at the middle of the leg 192 at the leg center plane 416, with the remaining portion
   of the leg end face 196 to the other of the leg sides 408 or 409 being non-recessed.
   [00222]       In one or more example embodiments, the leg end face recess 422
25 extends inwardly at least 90% of an extension between the first leg side 408 and
   second leg side 409.
   [00223]       In some example embodiments, the leg end face recess 422 extends
   inwardly at least 95% of an extension between the first leg side 408 and second leg
   side 409.
30 [00224]       In some example embodiments, the leg end face recess 422 extends
   inwardly at least 98% of an extension between the first leg side 408 and second leg
   side 409.
                                                35

   [00225]       While many embodiments are possible, in FIG. 14, the leg end face
   recess 422 is defined by at least first leg end face section 196a and second leg end
   face section 196b. At least one of the first leg end face section 196a and second leg
   end face section 196b extend inwardly toward the second side 176 of the body 172.
 5 In the embodiment shown in FIG. 14, both the first leg end face section 196a and
   second leg end face section 196b extend inwardly toward the second side 176 of the
   body 172.
   [00226]       In one or more example embodiments, the first leg end face section 196a
   extends inwardly in at least partial extension from the first leg side 408.
10 [00227]       In one or more example embodiments, the second leg end face section
    196b extends inwardly in at least partial extension from the second leg side 409.
   [00228]       While many different shapes and geometries are possible, in preferred
   implementations, the first leg end face section 196a is a generally non-curved
   section. The second leg end face section 196b can preferably be a generally non
15 curved section.
   [00229]       In one or more example embodiments, the first leg end face section 196a
   can be a straight section. In one or more example embodiments, the second leg end
   face section 196b can be generally a straight section.
   [00230]       In some embodiments, the first leg end face section 196a and second leg
20 end face section 196b meet at an intersection 424 in the leg end face 196. The
   intersection 424 of the first leg end face section 196a and second leg end face
   section 196b can be at any location between the first leg side 408 and second leg
   side 409. In one or more example embodiments, the intersection 424 is along a
   region of the leg end face 196 between 45-55% of the leg end face 196 between the
25 first leg side 408 and second leg side 409. For example, the intersection 424 can be
   plus or minus 5% of the distance from the center plane 416, when the center plane
   416 lies at 50% of the overall distance between the first leg side 408 and second leg
   side 409.
   [00231]       In some example embodiments, the intersection 424 of the first leg end
30 face section 196a and second leg end face section 196b is along a region of the leg
   end face 196 between 48-52% of the leg end face 196 between the first leg side 408
   and second leg side 409. For example, the intersection 424 can be plus or minus 2%
                                                36

   of the distance from the center plane 416, when the center plane 416 lies at 50% of
   the overall distance between the first leg side 408 and second leg side 409.
   [00232]      In some example embodiments, the intersection 424 of the first leg end
   face section 196a and second leg end face section 196b is along a region of the leg
 5 end face 196 that is in the center between the first leg side 408 and second leg side
   409, for example, even with the center plane 416, when the center plane 416 lies at
   50% of the overall distance between the first leg side 408 and second leg side 409.
   [00233]      Referring to FIG. 14, the first leg end face section 196a extends
   inwardly in complete extension from the first leg side 408 to the second leg end face
10 section 196b.
   [00234]      In many example embodiments, the second leg end face section 196b
   extends inwardly in complete extension from the second leg side 409 to the first leg
   end face section 196a.
   [00235]      Preferably, the first leg end face section 196a is angled inwardly at a
15 fifth extension angle, described previously at reference numeral 200, relative to a
   plane orthogonal to the leg center plane 416. In the example shown, the plane
   orthogonal to the leg center plane 416 includes the end face center plane 411,
   meaning that in some preferred embodiments, the fifth extension angle 200 of the
   first leg end face section 196a is taken relative to the end face center plane 411.    In
20 example embodiments, the first leg end face section 196a extends to about the leg
   center plane 416 in extension from the first leg side 408. The term "extension
   angle" is as used above, and refers to measurement of a line drawn between
   endpoints. In this case, the endpoints are at the intersection of: (i) first leg side 408
   and first leg end section 196a; and (ii) first leg end section 196a and leg center plane
25 416. "Extension angle" does not require the surface between the end points to be
   straight or planar.
   [00236]      The fifth extension angle 200, third extension angle 198, fourth
   extension angle 199 and second extension angle 182 can be equal to each other or
   different from each other. The fifth extension angle 200 can be less than 10 degrees
30 in some embodiments; less than 9 degrees in some embodiments; less than 8 degrees
   in some embodiments; less than 7 degrees in some embodiments; less than 6 degrees
   in some embodiments; less than 5 degrees in some embodiments. The fifth
   extension angle 200 can be greater than 1 degree in some embodiments; greater than
                                                37

   2 degrees in some embodiments; greater than 3 degrees is some embodiments; and
   greater than 4 degrees in some embodiments. In one or more example embodiments,
   the fifth extension angle 200 can be 2-7 degrees; and in one or more example
   embodiments, the fifth extension angle 200 can be 3-5 degrees. In one or more
 5 example embodiments, the fifth extension angle 200 can be about 4 degrees.
   [00237]      The second leg end face section 196b is angled inwardly at a sixth
   extension angle, described previously at reference numeral 201, relative to the plane
   orthogonal to the leg center plane 416. In the example shown, the plane orthogonal
   to the leg center plane 416 includes the end face center plane 411, meaning that in
10 some preferred embodiments, the sixth extension angle 201 of the second leg end
   face section 196b is taken relative to the end face center plane 411. In some
   example embodiments, the second leg end face section 196b extends to about the leg
   center plane 416 in extension from the second leg side 409. The term "extension
   angle" is as used above, and refers to measurement of a line drawn between
15 endpoints. In this case, the endpoints are at the intersection of: (i) second leg side
   409 and second leg end section 196b; and (ii) second leg end section 196b and leg
   center plane 416; although, again, as stated above, "extension angle" does not
   require the surface between the end points to be straight or planar.
   [00238]      The sixth extension angle 201, fifth extension angle 200, third extension
20 angle 198, and fourth extension angle 199 can be equal to each other or different
   from each other. The sixth extension angle 201 can be less than 10 degrees in some
   embodiments; less than 9 degrees in some embodiments; less than 8 degrees in some
   embodiments; less than 7 degrees in some embodiments; less than 6 degrees in some
   embodiments; less than 5 degrees in some embodiments. The sixth extension angle
25 201 can be greater than 1 degree in some embodiments; greater than 2 degrees in
   some embodiments; greater than 3 degrees is some embodiments; and greater than 4
   degrees in some embodiments. In one or more example embodiments, the sixth
   extension angle 201 can be 2-7 degrees; and in one or more example embodiments,
   the sixth extension angle 201 can be 3-5 degrees. In one or more example
30 embodiments, the sixth extension angle 201 can be about 4 degrees.
   [00239]      By reviewing the column 252 in FIG. 17, it can be appreciated that for
   advantages in constructing the column 252 in a manner which will cause the blocks
    170 to lock together and resist lateral movement between blocks 170, when the first
                                               38

   bearing face 401 is used as the upper face, the second extension angle 182 (the angle
   of the second portion 210 extending from the second leg side 409 to the second end
   face 180); the third extension angle 198 (the angle the first leg side 408 extends
   away from the first portion 206); fourth extension angle 199 (the angle the second
 5 leg side 409 extends away from the second portion 210); and the fifth extension
   angle 200 (the angle the first leg end face section 196a is angled inwardly) are made
   to be within plus or minus five degrees of each other. In some embodiments, the
   second extension angle 182, third extension angle 198, fourth extension angle 199,
   and fifth extension angle 200 are within (plus or minus) three degrees of each other.
10 In still further embodiments, the second extension angle 182, third extension angle
    198, fourth extension angle 199, and fifth extension angle 200 are about equal,
   meaning that they are within (plus or minus) one degree of each other.
   [00240]       In preferred embodiments, the first extension angle 412, second
   extension angle 182, third extension angle 198, fourth extension angle 199, fifth
15 extension angle 200 and sixth extension angle 201 are each less than 10 degrees.
   [00241]       Preferably, to achieve advantages in construction of structures, the first
   extension angle 412, second extension angle 182, third extension angle 198, fourth
   extension angle 199, fifth extension angle 200 and sixth extension angle 201 each is
   within plus or minus 5 degrees of the others. This arrangement results in the block
20  170 being capable of forming column 252 and free standing wall 262, in manner to
   lock the blocks 170 together and to be "tight" so that any free gaps in between
   adjacent blocks are small.
   [00242]       In one or more example embodiments, the first extension angle 412,
   second extension angle 182, third extension angle 198, fourth extension angle 199,
25 fifth extension angle 200 and sixth extension angle 201 are within plus or minus 3
   degrees of each other. Indeed, in some embodiments, each of the first extension
   angle 412, second extension angle 182, third extension angle 198, fourth extension
   angle 199, fifth extension angle 200 and sixth extension angle 201 are within plus or
   minus 1 degree of each other (i.e., about equal). When formed in this way, any gaps
30 between adjacent blocks 170 are small.
   [00243]       By reviewing FIG. 14, certain observations about symmetry or
   asymmetry are gleaned for preferred embodiments of the block 170. For example,
   in preferred embodiments, the outer perimeter of the first bearing face 401 of the leg
                                              39

    192 is symmetrical about the leg center plane 416. The "outer perimeter of the first
   bearing face 401 of the leg 192" includes the first and second leg sides 408, 409 and
   leg end face 196. The leg center plane 416 is non-coplanar with the second side
   center plane 410.     Preferably, the leg center plane 416 is spaced from and parallel to
 5 the second side center plane 410. The first bearing face 401 has an overall perimeter
   shape, as shown in FIG. 14 for example, and the non-leg portion of the outer
   perimeter shape of the first bearing face 401 is a non-mirror image relative to the
   second side center plane 410. By "outer perimeter shape of the first bearing face
   401 of the non-leg portion", it is meant the second side 176; end faces 178, 180; first
10 portion 206; and second portion 210. It does not include the first and second leg
   sides 408, 409 and leg end face 196. Of course, variations are possible.
   [00244]       In some example embodiments, the second end face 180 is angled at a
   seventh extension angle, previously described as angle 181, in a direction toward the
   first end face 178, as the second end face 180 extends from the second side 176 of
15 the body 172 to the first side 174 of the body 172. The seventh extension angle 181
   is non-zero and is not a right angle. The seventh extension angle 181 is measured
   relative to a plane parallel to the second side center plane 410. In preferred
   embodiments, the seventh extension angle 181 is acute, for example, less than 10
   degrees. The seventh extension angle 181 can be greater than 1, for example,
20 greater than 3 degrees. In some embodiments, the seventh extension angle 181 will
   be 7-9 degrees, for example about 8 degrees. The angled second end face 180 can
   allow for advantages in constructing structures from the block 170 including, for
   example, curved walls. The term "extension angle" is as defined above.
   [00245]       In the embodiment of FIG. 14, the distance between the first end face
25  178 and second end face 180 at the second side 176 of the body 172 (i.e., between
   the ends 406 and 407 of the second side 176) is greater than the distance between the
   first end face 178 and second end face 180 at the first side 174 of the body 172 (i.e.,
   at the intersection of the first end face 178 and first portion 206; and at the
   intersection of the second end face 180 and the second portion 210).
30 [00246]       As previously described, the block 170 can be used with other like
   blocks 170 to construct structures such as columns 252 (FIG. 16) and free standing
   walls 262.
                                                40

   [00247]       For example, and in reference now to FIG. 18, the block 170 is
   configured and arranged such that when first block 270 and second block 271 (each
   constructed in accordance with block 170 as described above) are set next to each
   other, at least a portion of body second end face 180 of the first block 270 is in
 5 contact with at least a portion of the body first end face 178 of the second block 271.
   The second sides 176 of the first block 270 and second block 271 extend generally
   along a common line and point in the same direction. This results in receiving space
   (or gap) 276 between the legs 192 of the first block 270 and second block 271
   forming an opening shaped to accept the leg 192 of third block 279 (the third block
10 279 being like-formed as block 170), when the third block 279 is oriented with its
   second side 176 pointed in an opposite direction of the second sides 176 of the first
   block 270 and second block 271.
   [00248]       The free standing wall 262 can be constructed by using a plurality of
   blocks 170 arranged in multiple courses. It should be understood that FIG. 18 shows
15 a top view of the free standing wall 262, which can include multiple courses. Each
   course includes two rows 266, 268, of blocks 170, with the blocks 170 in each row
   266, 268 laid end to end with the second side 176 of each block 170 forming a
   portion of an exposed face of the wall 262. By "end to end", it is meant that one of
   the second end faces 180 of a first block (such as block 270) will be adjacent and
20 along side one of the first end faces 178 of a second block (such as block 271). The
   leg 192 of each block 170 (such as block 279) in a first of the rows 268 is between
   adjacent legs 192 of two blocks 170 (such as blocks 270, 271) in a second of the
   rows 266.
   [00249]       In a further example of structures that can be made from the block 170,
25 reference is made to the column 252 of FIGS. 16 and 17. The block 170 is
   configured and arranged such that when first block 256, second block 257, third
   block 258, and fourth block 259, each made in accordance with block 170, are set
   next to each other: the first body end face 186 of the second block 257 is generally
   aligned with, and pointing in generally the same direction as, the second side 176 of
30 the first block 256; the third block 258 is next to, and in contact with, the second
   block 257, with the first body end face 186 of the third block 258 generally aligned
   with, and pointing in generally the same direction as, the second side 176 of the
   second block 257;        the fourth block 259 is between, and in contact with, the third
                                               41

   block 258 and first block 256 with the first body end face 186 of the fourth block
   259 generally aligned with, and pointing in generally the same direction as, the
   second side 176 of the third block 258; the first body end face 186 of the first block
   256 is generally aligned with, and pointing in generally the same direction as, the
 5 second side 176 of the fourth block 259; and gaps are formed between: (i) respective
   second portions 210 of the first side 174 of each of the first 256, second 257, third
   258, and fourth 259 blocks, and (ii) respective distal ends 419 of the leg 192 of each
   of the first 256, second 257, third 258, and fourth 259 blocks. In preferred
   arrangements, the gap is formed by the part of the distal ends 419 being the
10 respective first leg end face section 196a of each of the blocks 256, 257, 258, and
   259. Each of the gaps is filled by a leg 192 of one of the first 256, second 257, third
   258, and fourth 259 blocks.
   [00250]       Of course, it should be noted that for the column 252 of FIG. 17, the first
   bearing face 401 is also the face 401 that is the upper face 188 in use. In many
15 preferred embodiments, the column 252 includes multiple courses 254, and each
   course 254 will alternate between whether the first bearing face 401 or the second
   bearing face 402 is the upper face in use.
   [00251]       As can be seen in FIG. 16, the column 252 is depicted with multiple
   courses 254. Each course 254 includes four of the blocks 170 arranged in a
20 rectangle, which can be a square, in the example shown. The second side 176 of
   each block 170 and the first end face 178 of an adjacent block forms a side of the
   column 252. In some preferred arrangements, the second side 176 of each block 170
   and the first end face 178 of each block 170 are formed by splitting and, thus, has
   split faces 186, 184 respectively. The split faces 184, 186 will form the side of the
25 column 252, in such arrangements.
   [00252]          In preferred arrangements, for advantageous constructions of the
   column 252, the leg end face 196 of each block 170 is angled to match an angle of
   one of the first or second leg sides 408, 409 (e.g., third extension angle 198, fourth
   extension angle 199) of an adjacent block 170. The leg end face 196 can include,
30 for example, fifth extension angle 200, which can be within (plus or minus) 1 degree
   of fourth extension angle 199. This construction will result in the blocks 170 being
   locked together to resist lateral movement of each of the blocks 170 in the course
   254.
                                               42

   [00253]      As can be seen in FIG. 16, the blocks 170 in one course 254 (for
   example, a second course 432) are rotated 90 degrees around a vertical axis of the
   column 254 compared to the blocks 170 in an adjacent course 254 (for example, a
   first course 430). In this example, the first course 430 is constructed with the first
 5 bearing face 401 as the upper face, and the next adjacent course, second course 432,
   is arranged on top of the first course 430 using the second bearing face 402 as the
   upper face. This construction of the column 252 results in a running bond for the
   column 252.
10 [00254]      The above represents examples and principles. Many embodiments can
   be made utilizing these principles.
