        RESPIRATOR HAVING NONCIRCULAR CENTROID-MOUNTED EXHALATION VALVE
                                    ABSTRA CT OF THE INVENTION
              A respirator 10 that has a mask body 12 and a harness 16 has an exhalation valve
5 23 that includes a valve seat 36 and a flexible flap 42. The valve seat 36 has an orifice 38 and
  has a noncircular seal surface 40 surrounding the orifice 38. The flexible flap 42 is secured to
  the valve seat 36 at a centroid of the orifice and has a variable stiffness structure. The
  variable stiffness structure allows the flap to equally deflect under a given load at different
  distances from the centroid at the noncircular seal surface. An exhalation valve having this
0 construction may beneficially optimize pressure drop and overall valve performance for
  applications where valve space may be limited.

         RESPIRATOR HAVING NONCIRCULAR CENTROID-MOUNTED EXHALATION VALVE
   [0001]       The present invention pertains to a respirator where the exhalation valve has a
   non-circular, centroid-mounted flexible flap.
 5 [0001A]      Incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety, is PCT/US2014/064919
   (published as WO 2015/073395), filed on 11 November 2014.
                                              BACKGROUND
   [0002]       Persons who work in polluted environments commonly wear respirators to protect
   themselves from inhaling airborne contaminants. Respirators typically have a fibrous or
 0 sorbent filter that is capable of removing particulate and/or gaseous contaminants from the
   air. When wearing a respirator in a contaminated environment, wearers are comforted with
   the knowledge that their health is being protected, but they are, however, contemporaneously
   discomforted by the warm, moist, exhaled air that accumulates around their face. The greater
   this facial discomfort is, the greater chances are that the wearer may remove the respirator
 5 from their face to alleviate the unpleasant condition. To reduce the likelihood of this
   occurrence, respirator manufacturers often install an exhalation valve on the mask body to
   allow the warm, moist, exhaled air to be rapidly purged from the mask interior. The rapid
   removal of the exhaled air makes the mask interior cooler, which, in turn, benefits worker
   safety.
 0 [0003]       For many years, commercial respiratory masks have used "button-style"
   exhalation valves to purge exhaled air from mask interiors. The button-style valves typically
   have employed a thin, circular, flexible flap as the dynamic mechanical element that lets
   exhaled air escape from the interior gas space. The circular flap has been centrally-mounted
   to a valve seat through a central post. Examples of button-style valves are shown in U.S. Pat.
25 Nos. 2,072,516, 2,230,770, 2,895,472, and 4,630,604. When a person exhales, a
   circumferential portion of the flap is lifted from the valve seat so that the air can rapidly pass
   from the interior gas space into the exterior gas space.
   [0004]       Button-style valves have represented an advance in the attempt to improve wearer
   comfort, but investigators have made other improvements, an example of which is the
30 "butterfly-style" valve shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,934,362 to Braun. The valve described in the
   Braun patent uses a parabolic valve seat and an elongated flexible flap mounted in butterfly
   fashion.
                                                   - 1-

    1002079582
    [0005]       After the Braun development, another innovation was made in the exhalation
    valve art by Japuntich et al. -   see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,325,892 and 5,509,436. The Japuntich et
    al. valve used a single flexible flap that is mounted off-center in cantilevered fashion to
    minimize the exhalation pressure that is required to open the valve. When the valve-opening
 5  pressure is minimized, less power is required to operate the valve, which means that the
    wearer does not need to work as hard to expel exhaled air from the mask interior when
    breathing -- see also, U.S. Patent No. 7,493,900 to Japuntich et al.
    [00061       Other valves that have been introduced after the Japuntich et al. valve also have
    used cantilevered mounted flaps -      see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,687,767 and 6,047,698. In yet
 0  another development, the seal surface of the valve seat has been made from a resilient
    material that allows a thinner, yet stiffer flap to be used, which improves the valve efficiency
    -   see U.S. Patent No. 7,188,622 to Martin et al.
    [00071       Although the evolution of exhalation valve design has centered mainly around
    structural changes relative to the valve seat and the mounting of the flap to it, investigators
 5  also have made structural changes to the flap itself to enhance valve performance. In U.S.
    Patent Nos. 7,028,689 and 7,013,895 to Martin et al., multiple layers were introduced into the
    flap to create a thinner, more dynamic flap, which allowed the valve to open easier under less
    pressure. Ribs and a pre-curved, non-uniform, configuration also have been provided in the
    flap construction to provide good performance -- see U.S. Patent 7,302,951 to Mittelstadt et
 ,0 al. In U.S Patent Publication No. 2009/0133700 to Martin et al., slots have been provided in
    the valve flap at the hinge to improve valve performance. Also, in U.S. Published
    Application 2012/0167890A to Insley et al., the flap was ablated in selected areas to achieve
    desired valve performance. Flaps also have been made of an optical film, which causes the
    flap to flash so that users can readily detect proper valve operation - see U.S. Patent
25  Application 61/846456 to Martin et al.
    [00081       Respirator designs come in a variety of shapes and configurations and the design
    is often influenced by the orientation and placement of the filter cartridges and any exhalation
    valve that is placed on the mask body. Cantilevered valves, for example, are commonly
    oriented vertically on the mask body, with the free end of the flap pointed downward. If
30  oriented otherwise, the exhaled air may have the opportunity to fog a user's eyewear. Valve
    designs for high performance exhalation valves therefore can place constraints on mask body
    design. A new valve that can deliver exceptional valve performance, like a cantilevered
    valve, without having to be oriented vertically can help to alleviate constraints in valve
    design. The present invention described below has been created to provide such a valve.

 5                                     SUMMARY      OF THE INVENTION
    [0009]       According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided an exhalation valve
    that comprises: a valve seat that has an orifice and that has a noncircular seal surface
    surrounding the orifice; and a noncircular flexible flap that is secured to the valve seat at a
    centroid of the flexible flap and that has a variable stiffness structure.
 0  [0010]       According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a respirator that
    comprises: a harness; and a mask body that comprises an exhalation valve that includes: a
    valve seat that has an orifice and that has a noncircular seal surface surrounding the orifice;
    and a noncircular flexible flap that is secured to the valve seat at a centroid of the flexible flap
    and that has a variable stiffness structure.
 5  [00111       The present invention differs from known exhalation valves in that the inventive
    valve has a variable stiffness structure that allows the flap of a noncircular, centrally-mounted
    valve to be equally deflected at essentially any point along the flap perimeter. The ability to
    so equally deflect enables the valve to open freely and easily from the whole flap perimeter
    that is, essentially the same force will lift the flap from the valve seat at any point around the
 '0 perimeter. The variable stiffness structure can be fashioned to keep the valve closed under
    any orientation when the user is not exhaling, while, at the same time, provide the minimal
    force needed to open the valve during an exhalation. Reductions in exhalation pressure
    increase wearer comfort, particularly when the wearer is undergoing a strenuous activity.
    And, as indicated above, lower exhalation pressure improves wearer safety by reducing the
25  likelihood that the wearer will displace the respirator from their face during use. The
    invention therefore can enhance worker safety while also allowing the valve and respirator to
    be fashioned into a variety of shapes and configurations. The valve can be mounted on the
    mask body in a variety of orientations. The present invention therefore can expand the design
    window for exhalation valves and respirators, with the added benefit of providing exceptional
30  performance needed by respirator wearers.

                           DETAILED DESCRIPTION OFPREFERREDEMBODIMENTS
   [0047]      In practicing the present invention, a centroid-supported flexible flap, secured to a
   valve seat having a non-circular orifice, is provided with a variable stiffness structure that,
                                                    -5-

       WO 2015/073395                                                           PCT/US2014/064919
   despite having flap sections of different lengths from the point of securement, can open
   essentially equally at any point or segment along the flap perimeter. In known exhalation
   valves, longer length flaps typically lift more easily from the seal surface since the moment is
   greater. Because the invention has a variable stiffness structure that imparts a greater stiffness to
 5 the flap at radial segments that are longer, an increased force or load is required to open the flap
   on that radial at the same location. The increased stiffness at that radial counters the greater
   moment, which enables the flexible flap to equally deflect at different radials extending from the
   centroid when measured at the point where the various radials intersect with the seal surface. An
   exhalation valve having this construction may optimize pressure drop and overall valve
 0 performance for non-circular exhalation valves. A non-circular valve having this construction
   also may be beneficially shaped into various configurations where similarly performing
   cantilevered valves have been limited.
   [0048]       FIG. 1 shows a respirator 10 that has a mask body 12 and a cover plate 14 located on
   the front of the mask body 12. The respirator 10 also includes a harness 16 that has straps 18a,
 5 18b for supporting the respirator 10 on a wearer's head during use. The upper straps 18a may be
   attached to a crown member 18c, which rests on the crown of the wearer's head during use. The
   lower set of straps 18b extends behind the wearer's neck during use and may include a releasable
   buckle to accommodate ease of attachment and removal. Example of harnesses that may be
   suitable for use in the present invention are described in U.S Patents 6,732,733 to Brostrom et al.
 0 and 6,715,490 to Byram. The cover plate 14 may be provided with one or more slots 19 that
   accommodate the straps 18a, 18b. A pair of filter cartridges 20 is attached to the mask body 12
   to provide clean air for the wearer to breathe. The cartridges 20 contain one or more layers of
   filter media that remove contaminants from the ambient air when the wearer inhales. The filter
   media may remove particulate contaminants and/or gaseous contaminants, depending on the
25 application. The filter cartridges 20 may be plugged into the cartridge receptacles 21 using the
   apparatus described in U.S Patent Application 2013/0125896 to Dwyer et al. The respirator 10
   also may be provided with a voice transmission apparatus 22 that enables the respirator wearer
   to more easily communicate with others. An exhalation valve 23 (FIGs. 2-6) may be disposed
   beneath an exhalation valve cover 24 located on the cover plate 14. The valve cover 24 may
30 have a series of openings 26 in it, which allow exhaled air to pass from the underlying valve into
   the ambient air space. A negative-pressure check button 28 may be installed centrally on the
   mask body 12 to allow a respirator wearer to quickly evaluate whether a leak free seal is
   provided at the mask body face seal 30. To make such an evaluation, a wearer simply pushes the
   button 28 and inhales. The button push causes the inhalation valve 31 (FIG. 6) to close. If air is
                                                    -6-

   detected entering the mask body interior during the attempted inhalation, the face seal is not
   seated properly on the wearer's face. The respirator may be too large or small, or there may be
   an obstruction that denies a good face fit. A pressure-check button suitable for such use is
   described in co-pending U.S Patent Application Serial No. 13/757373 to Mittelstadt et al. The
 5 face seal 30 may be made of a pliant or elastomeric material such as silicone to allow the face
   seal to fit snugly to various faces. The face seal 30 is secured to a rigid central portion 32 of the
   mask body 12 to make the resulting product lighter to wear. A mask body 12 that uses such a
   rigid central portion has been described in U.S. Patent 5,062,421to Bums and Reischel - see also
   U.S Patent 7,650,884 to Flannigan et al.
 0 [0049]       FIG. 2 shows the mask body 12 having the cover plate 14 separated therefrom.
   Located beneath the cover plate 14 is the exhalation valve 23. The exhalation valve 23 has a
   valve seat 36 that has an orifice 38 and a noncircular seal surface 40 surrounding the orifice 38.
   The exhalation valve 23 also includes a flexible flap 42 that is secured to the valve seat 36 at a
   centroid 44 of the flap 42 and that has a variable stiffness structure 46 (FIG. 3) that allows the
 5 flexible flap 42 to equally deflect at the valve seat seal surface 40 in response to a force exerted
   by a wearer's exhaled air. The flexible flap 42 also has a first alignment element 46, and the
   valve seat 36 has a second alignment element 48 that mates with the first alignment element 46.
   The first and second alignment elements 46 and 48 enable the flexible flap 42 to be properly
   oriented on the valve seat 36. Establishing proper orientation is particularly important in a non
 0 circular flap since a slight rotation of flap 42 about the centroid 44 may cause the underside 50
   of flap 42 to reside out of contact with the seal surface 40. Button valves, for example, only
   need to be aligned centrally because valve flap rotation is not an issue. The first and second
   alignment elements 46 and 48 accordingly not only provide for alignment of the flap centroid 44
   with the valve seat centroid 52 but they also preclude rotation of the flap 42 about the centroid
25 52 in the flap plane. To do so, the first alignment element 46 includes one or more rotation
   prevention elements 53a that mate with a similarly sized rotation-prevention elements 53b in the
   second alignment element 48. The valve seat 36 also can be provided with one or more joists 54
   that extend radially from the second alignment element 48 to the orifice inner edge 56 (FIG. 2).
   The joists 54 support the second alignment element 48 within the valve orifice 38 at its proper
30 location.
   [0050]       FIG. 3 shows the exhalation valve 23 with the flexible flap 42 resting on the valve
   seat 36 (FIGs. 4 and 5) in the closed position. The flap 42 typically is biased toward the valve
   seat 36 when it its closed position. The bias preferably is fashioned to be "slight", that is, the
   bias is fashioned to keep the flap 42 in a closed position under minimal force regardless of valve
                                                     -7-

       WO 2015/073395                                                            PCT/US2014/064919
   orientation when airflow forces are not being exerted on the flap 42. A slight bias may be
   achieved by constructing the variable stiffness structure 46 to cause the flap 42 to remain closed
   along all points around the flap perimeter 58 when inverted and exposed only to gravity. The
   flexible flap 42 also is adapted to equally deflect in response to an exhalation pressure. The
 5 variable stiffness structure 46 enables any segment of the flap perimeter 58 to have an essentially
   equal chance of being lifted from the seal surface 40 (FIGs. 2, 4, and 5) during an exhalation.
   The illustrated flap 42 and the underlying seal surface 40 both have an oblong shape when
   viewed through a plane projected onto the outer major surface 60 of the flexible flap 42.
   Essentially all other non-circular shapes are contemplated within this invention. The flap 42 and
 0 seal surface 40 do not necessarily have to have the same shape, although such is typically
   preferred for better performance. The flap 42 and seal surface 40 may have, for example, a
   rectangular, square, triangular, elliptical, hexagonal, octagonal, irregular, or other shape. The
   valve seat 36 is secured to a substrate material 62 when in use. The substrate material 62 may be
   one or more of the materials that comprises the mask body 12 (FIG. 1). If the valve is attached
 5 to a filtering face mask - see, for example, U.S. Patents 7,131,442 to Kronzer et al. and
   6,923,182 to Angadjivand et al - the valve seat may be secured to the nonwoven fibrous
   materials of the mask body filtering structure. If the mask body is one that contains filter

   radially from the centroid 44. The adjacent ribs may be separated from each other at an angle of
   about 10 to 45 degrees, more typically about 15 to 30 degrees. The longer ribs 64a that extend
25 from the flap centroid 44 to the longer ends 66 are configured to be stiffer than the shorter ribs
   64b that extend from the flap centroid 44 to the shorter ends 68 of the flap 42. The different
   degrees of stiffness may achieved by making the stiffer ribs 64a taller or wider than the less stiff
   ribs 64b. Thus, the cross section of the stiffer ribs 64a may be greater than the cross section of
   the less stiff ribs 64b. The difference in cross-sectional area may be about 10 to 50 %.
30 Alternatively, the stiffer ribs 64a may be made from a stiffer material than the less stiff ribs 64b
   while having a similar cross section. Another way to provide a variable stiffness structure is to
   make the flap 42 thicker in the sections that have the greater length or moment. Flaps that have
   ribs and non-uniform thicknesses are described in U.S. Patent U.S. Patents 6,883,518 to

   [0051]        FIGs. 4 and 5 show how the longer ribs 64a have a greater height than the shorter ribs
   64b. The increase in rib height with a similar width creates a larger cross section and thereby
   increases the rib stiffness. The stiffer rib 64a keeps the free end 66 of the flap 42 biased toward
   the seal surface 40 so that it remains closed despite the orientation of the valve 23. The shorter
 0 free end of 68 of flap 42 therefore has an equal chance of being deflected when compared to the
   longer free end 66. The flap deflection ration (FDR) for flexible flaps, used in connection with
   the present invention, is less than 2, preferably less than 1.5, and more preferably less than 1.4
   when tested according to the Flap Deflection Test set forth below. The FDR preferably is as
   close to 1 as possible. FDRs less than 1.3, 1.2 and 1.1 also can be achieved. Typically any point
 5 measured along the flap perimeter 58 at any radial extending from the centroid using the Flap
   Deflection Test exhibits no more than 10 millinewtons (mN) load, preferably no more than 5
   inN, to deflect the flap 1 millimeter (mm). Each point along the flap perimeter measured for
   load to deflect the flap this 1 mm distance preferably does not differ from any other point so
   measured by more than 100 %, more preferably by more than 50%, and still more preferably by
 0 more than 25%.

   When the respirator 10 (FIG. 1) is in use, the mask body 12 separates the interior gas space from
   the exterior gas space. Clean air that enters the interior gas space through port 70 passes into a
   central plenum 72 before it passes through inhalation valve 31 where it can then be inhaled by
25 the respirator wearer. The clean air is created by first passing through a filter cartridge 20 (FIG.
    1). The cartridge 20 is plugged into receptacle 21 (FIG. 2) when the respirator is being used. A
   mask body that has this configuration is described in U.S Patent Application Serial No.

30 lifts a free end of the flexible flap 42 from the seal surface 40 to allow air to pass through valve
   orifice 38 and openings 26 in cover plate 14. In lieu of a cover plate 14, a valve cover may be
   used to protect the valve and to direct exhaled air downwardly. An example of a valve cover is

   Flap Deflection Test
   [0053]      This test measures the load or force needed to lift the flexible flap from the valve seat
   seal surface 1 mm in height.
 5 [0054]      To carry out this test, the exhalation valve is first positioned in a test apparatus that is
   properly calibrated. ThreeZaber motion linear translation motion stages (model T-LSR 150 are
   used for 3D sample positioning. They are assembled such that the clamping fixture with the
   attached sample may be translated in three dimensions for sample positioning and loading via
   manually operated pots on each stage. The clamping fixture is fashioned to hold the valve seat.
 0 A Transducer Techniques load cell (model GSO-10) is positioned below sample in the area of
   interest with a static fixture and with an 0.5 mm attached flat punch. The flat punch has a
   diameter of 0.5 mm at the tip with a 1mm diameter shank of length 16 mm which is attached to a
   threaded stud which in turn threads into the load cell . The length of the flat punch is 1.25
   inches. A Universal Serial Bus (USB) DinoliteTM microscope is set 2.75 inches from the
 5 probe/sample for a side view of the punch lifting the flap. The load cell is wired to a 10 volt DC
   supply via a Transducer Techniques model TMO- 1 conditioner where the gain is set to the
   maximum value. The load cell is attached to a static stand with the punch facing upward towards
   area of interest. The load cell is tuned using a pot on the TMO-1 conditioner. The load cell and
   the USB microscope are interfaced to a computer via a Measurement Computing FS1408 USB
 0 data acquisition board and an associated TracerDAQ and Instacal software. The data
   acquisition board is selected and tested with the InstacalTM software. The load cell is calibrated
   with gram weights, then a linear fit of the force (mN) vs. millivolt output is calculated. The
   sample is clamped to the motion stage fixture with flap installed on the valve seat. The punch is
   located underneath the regions to be tested via the motion stage. The distance measurement is
25 enabled by placing a graduated ruler next to where the flap is to be lifted. The resultant image is
   saved for 0.5 mm gradations.
   [0055]      Once the test sample is properly positioned in the device, the following steps are
   carried out to measure the load needed to lift the flexible flap from the seal surface:
            1.      The punch is positioned beneath the flexible flap at the location where the flap
30 meets the seal surface. The punch is almost touching the valve. The data acquisition for the
   load channel is initiated for TracerdaqTM software. A sample rate of 100 samples/sec and 3
   minute sample length is used to take the data.

            2.      Immediately after the load channel begins to accumulate data, the operator
   switches to the video screen to see the probe in near contact with sample. Video recording is
   initiated.
            3.      Using z-stage control, the sample is lowered onto probe while the video shows
 5 the valve flap lifting from base due to engagement with the probe.
            4.      At a lift value of approximately 1 mm, the dwell controller maintains the probe in
   place for a 2 - 3 second time period.
            5.      After the dwell segment is completed, the load is removed from flap using the z
   stage controller.
 0          6.      A dwell at zero load is then held for 5 seconds.
            7.      Steps 3-6 are repeated twice more.
            8.      Load vs. time is saved in TracerdaqTM software; the video is saved in the Dinolite
   software.
            9.      The video is reviewed to frame the maximum lift during the test. Then the 1 mm
 5 lift distance is measured and verified using a calibration from the graduated ruler.
   [0056]       The output from the system is in millivolts. The linear fit is used to determine the
   load, which is then reported in milliNewtons (mN). The load at a 1 mm deflation is measured at
   two locations. Location 1 is the point where the shortest radial extending from the centroid
   intersects with the inside surface of the valve orifice, and location 2 is the point where the
 0 longest radial intersects with the inside surface of the valve orifice. Location 1 is identified in
   FIG. 4 by numeral 74, and location 2 is identified in FIG. 5 by numeral 76.
   Example El
   [0057]       An exhalation valve that resembled the valve shown in FIGs. 2-6 was constructed.
25 The flexible flap was molded using a Wacker Elastosil 3001-60 silicone rubber. The valve seat
   and its sealing surface were made from a stereolithography (SLA) process using an AccuraTM 60
   rapid prototype material. The flexible flap had a long axis length of 41 millimeters (mm) (20.5
   mm from the centroid) and had a short axis length of 25 mm (12.5 mm from the centroid). The
   flexible flap was designed to stay shut under a gravity load at any orientation. The ribs were
30 located oriented as shown in FIG. 3. The ribs extended radially from the centroid such that
   adjacent ribs were spaced from each other at about 24 degrees. The angular spacing was the
   same for each of the ribs. The continuous flap sheet that was joined to the ribs had a thickness
   of about 0.28 mm. In an earlier construction that lacked ribs attached to this flap sheet, the flap
   was found to not stay shut in all orientations under a gravity load. The cross-sectional area of

   the ribs varied. The ribs at the long axis had a maximum cross-sectional area of about 0.25 mm2 .
                                                                                          2
   The ribs at the short axis had a maximum cross-sectional area of about 0.13 mm . Ribs that had
   such a cross-sectional area were found to buckle when the flap was exposed to a force that
   caused the flap to bend. The length of the longest rib was 18.5 mm. The length of the shortest
 5 rib was 10.2 mm. The rib height at the centroid of the longest rib was 0.82 mm. The rib height
   at the centroid of the shortest rib was 0.42 mm. The tallest rib tapers to approximately a 0.4 mm
   height at the perimeter. The rib width was 0.31 mm and was the same for all ribs. All the ribs
   intersect a boss located at the flap centroid. The boss had a 4.5 mm diameter. An alignment
   element is symmetrical about the centroid and is 3 mm wide and 10.2 mm long. The alignment
 0 element tapers from the flap membrane to a plane that has a maximum distance of 2.8 mm from
   the flap.
   [0058]       The valve seat was produced to have the configuration shown in FIGs. 2, 4, and 5.
   The valve seat was created by rapid prototyping.
   [0059]       The flexible flap was joined to the valve seat by pushing the center boss and
 5 alignment feature into a corresponding mating feature on the valve seat. The mating feature has
   a hole that accepts the boss/alignment feature and holds the valve onto the valve seat
   [0060]       The resulting exhalation valve was tested according to the Flexible Flap Test, and the
   results are set forth below in Table 1.

   [0061]       Table 1 shows the FDR for El, which was 1.40 (2.45/1.74). This data show that the
   resulting exhalation valve has a FDR within the scope of the present invention. The flexible flap
   therefore can equally deflect, allowing any segment of the flap perimeter to be lifted from the
25 valve seat during an exhalation.
   Deflection/ForceSimulation
   [0062]       Finite element analysis software can be used to compare the deflection characteristics
   of a flexible flap that has a variable stiffness structure to an equivalent flap that lacks such a
   structure. A computer model of the valve system consists of a mesh of finite elements that
30 represents the flap geometry. Finite elements are small domains of the entire structure. The
                                                     - 12 -

   governing differential equations are numerically calculated across these elements. Each element
   is bounded by nodes with straight lines between them. Nodes may be a part of a number of
   neighboring finite elements. All of the elements connected together represent a mesh. This
   mesh closely approximates the geometry of the structure you are analyzing.
 5 [0063]       The flexible flaps are thin walled structures that can use shell finite elements to
   approximate the flap thickness. Shell elements are typically triangular flat elements that have 3
   nodes. A shell model has the appropriate thickness applied to the elements as an attribute. The
   thickness is then accounted for in the computations. If desired, three-dimensional elements can
   be used to model the thickness also. These 3D elements typically have four faces and three
 0 nodes.
   [0064]       To reduce the model size, symmetry can be used. Appropriate boundary conditions
   need to be applied to the model across planes of symmetry. Nodes that lie on this plane are
   constrained to allow rotation only within that plane. They are also constrained to ensure there is
   no deflection out of the plane.
 5 [0065]       Since the flap is constrained at the support feature at the centroid, the model can be
   further simplified if desired. For the simulation, the nodes on the seal membrane and the ribs
   can be fixed at the intersection with the center support instead of modeling the entire support.
   [0066]       The shell mesh needs to be created with a sufficient number of elements to accurately
   model the flap geometry and the contact to the seal surface.      The seal surface should be
 0 modeled with rigid contact elements. To preload the flap, the seal surface elements are raised
   into the flap mesh, which creates the preload.
   [0067]      A representative elastic modulus and a poisson's ratio are applied to the model. The
   model of the flap without a gravity load is now complete.
   [0068]       For the simulation, one of the nodes at the desired location is raised off of the rigid
25 elements, which represent the sealing surface. The nodes are raised in small increments until the
   final deflection is reached. For this simulation, the deflection is limited so the effect of the
   stiffness of the neighboring region does not dominate the results. This technique can replicate
   the FlapDeflection Test. The results from the analysis are the force at a given deflection at the
   noted location.
30 Simulated Exhalation Valve - Example SEl
   [0069]       The exhalation valve produced according to this example was a valve that had the
   same flexible flap as example E1, that is, it was a computer simulation of the E l valve having
   the same flexible flap. The finite element analysis software used in this example was
   ABAQUS*. The simulated example used a modulus of 350 pounds per square inch(psi) and a

   Poisson's ratio of 0.5 to represent the 3001-60 silicone material. An analysis was run at each of
   the two locations specified in the FlapDeflection Test (Location 1 and Location 2). At each
   location, the flap was raised off the contact elements, representing the seal surface at one
   location. The maximum deflection used was 1 mm. The deflection was applied in ten
 5 increments until the flap was opened to the maximum deflection value. At each increment, the
   reaction load was calculated by the software.
   [0070]       To maximize the flap efficiency, at a defined opening around the perimeter, the loads
   should be "equivalent".     Stated differently, the flap deflection should be the same at a given
   load. To determine this, the FDR is calculated from the output of the analysis between locations
 0  1 and 2 at the valve seal surface. The FDR between the longest and the shortest radials was used
   as a representative measure of this equivalency. Table 2 shows the resultant force and FDR for
   each deflection increment for example SE1.

   [0073]       Table 2 and Table 3 show the results for SE1 and SCEl respectively. As expected,
   the non-ribbed version had lower loads. This was expected because the membrane thickness
10 was maintained at 0.28 mm. This flap thickness, however, was not adequate to hold the valve
   shut in all orientations under gravity.
   [0074]       Both tables show the FDR at locations 1 and 2 for each case. A fully optimized
   system would have a ratio of 1. SE1 has an average ratio of 1.25 when deflected at increments
   between .2 mm to 1 mm. The "equivalent" stiffness example (SCE1) without the ribs had a
15 much higher average ratio of 3.76. At 1 mm deflections, the FDRs were 1.23 and 2.34
   respectively.
   Simulated Exhalation Valve - Example SE2
   [0075]       Another exhalation valve with a lower aspect ratio was analyzed. The flexible flap
   had a long axis length of 35.5 millimeters (mm) (17.75 mm from the centroid) and had a short

  axis length of 32 mm (16 mm from the centroid). The flexible flap was designed to stay shut
  under a gravity load at any orientation. The ribs extended radially from the centroid such that
  adjacent ribs were spaced from each other at about 24 degrees. The angular spacing was the
  same for each of the ribs. The continuous flap sheet that was joined to the ribs had a thickness
5 of about 0.28 mm. The cross-sectional area of the ribs varied. The ribs at the long axis had a
  maximum cross-sectional area of about .23 mm 2 . The ribs at the short axis had a maximum
  cross-sectional area of about .19 mm2 . Ribs that had such a cross-sectional area were found to
  buckle when the flap was exposed to a force that caused the flap to bend. The length of the
  longest rib was 16.9 mm. The length of the shortest rib was 14.0 mm. The rib height at the
0 centroid of the longest rib was 0.77 mm. The rib height at the centroid of the shortest rib was
  0.68 mm. The tallest rib tapers to approximately a.4 mm height at the perimeter. The shortest
  rib tapers to approximately a .25 mm height at the perimeter. The rib width was 0.31 mm and
  was the same for all ribs. The boss and alignment feature were the same as described in SE l.
  [0076]       The finite element analysis software used in this example was ABAQUS*®. The
5 simulated example used a modulus of 350 pounds per square inch(psi) and a Poisson's ratio of
  0.5 to represent the 3001-60 silicone material. An analysis was run at each of the two locations
  specified in the FlapDeflection Test (Location 1 and Location 2). At each location, the flap was
  raised off the contact elements, representing the seal surface at one location. The maximum
  deflection used was 1 mm. The deflection was applied in ten increments until the flap was
0 opened to the maximum deflection value. At each increment, the reaction load was calculated
  by the software.

   [0079]      Table 4 and Table5 show the results for SE2 and SCE2 respectively. Both tables
   show the FDR at locations 1 and 2 for each case. SE2 has an average ratio of 1.32 when
10 deflected at increments between .2 mm to 1 mm. The "equivalent" stiffness example (SCE2)
   without the ribs had a higher ratio of 1.71. At 1 mm deflection, the FDR's were 1.32 and 1.51
   respectively.
   [0080]      The FDR's were closer due to an aspect ratio's approaching 1. The advantage of a
   variable stiffness flap decreases as the shortest length radial and the longest length radial become
15 similar. However, there is still an advantage as long as the radials are of difference lengths.

  [0081]      The variable stiffness valves, SE1 and SE2, had "equivalent load" for equal
  deflections when comparing the perimeter location at the longest distance from the centroid to
  the location at the shortest distance to the centroid This results in the flap lifting open around
  the entire periphery under a given exhalation pressure. With more flap perimeter lifting a
5 greater distance from the seal surface, the pressure drop decreases across the valve orifice, which
  increases user comfort by reducing the exhalation pressure at a given flow rate.
