                                   FIELD OF INVENTION
           [0004] The present invention generally relates to waste management devices, and
more particularly, to a toilet apparatus and method of its use.
                                       BACKGROUND
           [0005] Toilets, which may also be referred to as commodes, generally refer to
devices used for the disposal of human waste. Flush toilets are a common type of toilet
that uses water to facilitate removal of the waste to a processing site, such as a septic
system, for its decomposition. More recently, however, other toilet designs have been
implemented that can, among other things, reduce water usage levels required for their
operation. Examples of such toilets include composting toilets that process the waste
locally, and chemical based toilets that use chemicals to deodorize the waste until it can
be moved to another location for processing. Nevertheless, each of these toilet designs
require special handling techniques to ensure the safe movement of waste to a sanitary
location for the toilet's continued use. It is with these problems in mind, among other
problems, that embodiments of the present disclosure have been developed.
                                         SUMMARY
           [0006] According to one embodiment, a toilet apparatus includes a waste material
receiving bowl having a top member with an opening and a disposable bag to receive and
retain waste material and an absorbent media introduced through the opening. An
electronic agitation device agitates the absorbent media and the waste material to cause
58110081.1                                      1

the absorbent media to at least substantially cover the waste material while the agitation
device is not contacting the absorbent media and the waste material.
           [0007] According to another embodiment, a toilet control system includes a
control circuit that detects, using a lid position sensor, when a lid of a toilet is moved
from a closed position to an open position, the toilet including a waste material receiving
bowl comprising a top member with an opening. The control circuit also detects, using a
bag sensor, when a disposable bag is placed in the bowl. The control circuit controls an
absorbent media dispenser to dispense absorbent media into the bag when the lid is
opened and the bag is installed, and controls an electronic agitation device to agitate the
absorbent media and the waste material to cause the absorbent media to at least
substantially cover the waste material, wherein the agitation device remains separated
from contact with the absorbent media and the waste material.
           [0008] According to yet another embodiment, a toilet control method includes
detecting when a lid of a toilet is moved from a closed position to an open position, the
toilet comprising a waste material receiving bowl comprising a top member with an
opening. The method also detects when a disposable bag is placed in the bowl. The
method controls an absorbent media dispenser to dispense absorbent media into the bag
when the lid is opened and the bag is installed, and controls an electronic agitation device
to agitate the absorbent media and the waste material to cause the absorbent media to at
least substantially cover the waste material, wherein the agitation device remains
separated from contact with the absorbent media and the waste material.
           [0009] According to yet another embodiment, a method includes providing a
waste material receiving bowl comprising a top member with an opening, providing a
disposable bag to receive and retain waste material and an absorbent media introduced
through the opening, and agitating, using an electronic agitation device, the absorbent
media and the waste material to cause the absorbent media to at least substantially cover
the waste material while keeping the agitation device separated from the absorbent media
and the waste material.
           [0009.5] According to yet another embodiment, a toilet apparatus includes a
waste material receiving bowl comprising a top member with an opening and a
disposable bag to receive waste material and an absorbent media introduced through the

opening. An electronic agitation device agitates the absorbent media and the waste
material while not contacting the absorbent media and the waste material.
           [0009.7] According to yet another embodiment, a toilet apparatus includes a
waste material receiving bowl comprising a top member with an opening and an annular
seating surface and a disposable bag to receive and retain waste material and an absorbent
media introduced through the opening. An electronic agitation device agitates the
absorbent media and the waste material at a lower portion of the bag to cause the
absorbent media to at least substantially cover the waste material while the electronic
agitation device is not contacting the absorbent media and the waste material.

58110081.1

                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
           [0017] As described previously, current toilet designs have often required special
handling techniques for the safe and sanitary removal of waste. Nevertheless, currently
implemented solutions for this problem have required the use of one or more additional
materials that could potentially be harmful to the environment. For example, flush toilets
often require the use of relatively large amounts of water, which has been recognized as a
valuable commodity, particularly in locations where water has become a scarce resource.
Chemical toilets use less water than their flush toilet counterparts, but require the use of
chemicals that typically hinders the efficient decomposition of the waste, even after the
waste is removed from the toilet. Additionally, composting toilets may use one or more
types of microbes to decompose the waste in place. Yet the composting process provided
by these microbes can often generate unpleasant odors that may require additional
mechanisms, such as ventilation systems, thus limiting the locations at which these
composting toilets may be used. Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a
solution to these problems, among other problems, using a toilet apparatus and method
that uses disposable bags which can be easily handled for safe and sanitary removal of
waste from the toilet by keeping the waste separated from the components of the toilet
apparatus, and mechanical vibration to enhance mixing of the waste with an absorbent
media as it is introduced into the toilet such that odors normally associated with the waste
are minimized as well as providing enhanced sterilization by dehydrating the waste
material immediately upon entry of the waste into the toilet.
           [0018] FIGS. 1A through 2C illustrate an example toilet 100 according to one
embodiment of the present disclosure. In particular, FIGS. 1A and 2A show perspective
views of the toilet 100, FIGS. 1B and 2B show side views of the toilet 100, while FIGS.
IC and 2C show front views of the toilet 100. The toilet 100 includes a housing 102 for
housing a waste material receiving bowl 104, and a top member 106 with an opening
defining an annular seating surface. In one embodiment, the annular seating surface may
include a seat 108 that is configured between the top member 106 and a lid 110. The
toilet 100 also includes a lid 110. The seat 108 and the lid 110 are hingedly affixed to the
housing 102. The lid 110 and seat 108 are movable from a closed position (FIGS. 1A,
IB, and IC) adjacent to the top member 106 to an open position away from the top
58110081.1                                      4

member 106 (FIGS. 2A, 2B, and 2C). Although FIGS. 1A through 2C show several
features of the toilet 100, it should be understood that the toilet 100 may include
additional, fewer, or different features than those described herein without departing from
the spirit or scope of the present disclosure.
           [0019] FIG. 3 illustrates a cut-away view showing several features of the example
toilet 100 according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. In general, the space
between the housing 102 and the bowl 104 forms a chamber 120 for housing several
components of the toilet 100, such as a vibrating mechanism 114 or other agitation
device, a vacuum pump 116, and a control circuit 118 that controls the operation of the
vibrating mechanism 114 and the vacuum pump 116.
           [0020] The toilet 100 can be configured with a disposable bag 122 that is
releasably secured in the bowl 104 and configured to receive and hold a specified amount
of absorbent media 124. In general, the disposable bag 122 that can be releasably
secured inside the bowl 104 and partially filled with an absorbent media 124 such that
when used, agitation may be imparted to the absorbent media 124 for mixing with any
waste introduced into the disposable bag 122 while keeping the components of the toilet,
such as the vibrating mechanism 114 or other agitation device, separated from
communication with (i.e., not touching) the waste material and absorbent media in the
disposable bag 122. Following the introduction of waste, the disposable bag 122 may be
removed from the bowl 104 and disposed of and another disposable bag 122 releasably
secured to the bowl 104 for ensuing uses of the toilet 100.
           [0021] Certain embodiments of the toilet 100 may provide advantages not
heretofore recognized by traditional toilet designs. For example, embodiments of the
toilet 100 may reduce or eliminate the extraneous use of certain materials required by
traditional toilet designs, such as water, chemical treatment, biological decomposing
materials, and the like. Additionally, the disposable bag 122 provides a temporary
chamber for receiving waste and disposing of the waste in a safe, sanitary manner, while
the absorbent media provides for at least partial encapsulation of the waste such that any
odors generated by the waste are minimized. Additionally, because little or no water is
required for its operation, the toilet 100 may be used in locations where a source of water
or means to manage the processing and removal of waste may not be readily available,
58110081.1                                       5

such as in a portable, remote environment (e.g., during a long road trip, a camping
excursion, etc.).
           [0022] The bowl 104 and the housing 102 form an enclosed chamber 120 that is
generally sealed from the outside environment. When the vacuum pump 116 is turned
on, it generates a vacuum (e.g., negative) pressure inside the chamber 120. In one
embodiment, the vacuum pump 116 includes one or more fans that, when powered on,
blow air from the chamber 120 to the ambient environment. Additionally, a certain
quantity of holes may be left uncovered by the bag 122 so that an airflow may be
generated from the bowl 104 into the chamber 120 for minimizing odors generated
during the use of the toilet 100. Nevertheless, the vacuum pump 116 may include any
device that creates a vacuum condition inside the chamber 120 when powered on, such as
a piston-driven pump having check valves at its entry and exit ports. Additionally, the
vacuum pump 116 may be omitted if a vacuum condition is not needed or desired for the
operation of the toilet 100.
           [0023] The bowl 104 may be made of any suitable material (e.g., sheet metal,
plastic, fiberglass, etc.) and have any desired shape to receive and temporarily hold the
disposable bag 122 against its surface. In one embodiment, the bowl 104 includes a side
member 128 formed of sheet metal into a cylindrical shape and has holes 130 configured
along its extent, such that, when the vacuum pump 116 is powered on, the disposable bag
122 is urged against the surface of the side member 128. Also, the bowl 104 includes a
bottom member 132 that is formed of an air permeable material (e.g., screen, fabric, etc.)
that allows the vacuum pressure generated in the chamber 120 to urge the disposable bag
122 against the bottom member 132. In one embodiment, the bottom member 132 is
resilient or stretchable to allow vibrational energy generated by the vibrating mechanism
114 to be transferred to the absorbent media 124 for causing movement or agitation of the
absorbent media 124 for enhanced mixing with any waste introduced into the disposable
bag 122.
           [0024] The vibrating mechanism 114 forms an agitation device for agitating the
absorbent media 124 disposed in the disposable bag 122. In one embodiment, the
vibrating mechanism 114 includes a motor 136 with an eccentrically mounted pin 138
that is coupled to the bottom member 132 via a line 140 (e.g., rope, twine, strap, cable,
58110081.1                                     6

etc.) such that rotation of the motor 136 causes the vibrational energy to be imparted in a
generally vertical direction (e.g., up and down) on the bottom member 132.
Nevertheless, other embodiments contemplate that the vibrating mechanism 114 may
include any mechanism that generates vibrational energy that is imparted into the
absorbent media 124. For example, the vibrating mechanism 114 may be a motor having
an eccentrically mounted weight on its shaft, which is physically coupled to the bottom
member 132. Certain embodiments of the toilet 100 that use vertical excitation of the
absorbent media 124 may be advantageous in that vibrational excitation of the absorbent
media 124 may be maximized relative to the overall vibration incurred by the toilet 100
during its use.
           [0025] The absorbent media 124 may include any suitable type of material that
mixes with the waste under the influence of vibrational energy. In one embodiment, the
absorbent media is a granular material, such as sand, pumice, pet litter, zeolite, clay,
sepiolite, crushed cellulose, etc.). In one embodiment, the frequency (e.g., rotational
speed of the motor) and/or amplitude (e.g., cyclical distance traveled by the bottom
member 132) of the vibrational energy may be selected according to the size and density
of the absorbent media 124. In this manner, a specified level and frequency of
vibrational energy may be produced that optimally excites the absorbent media 124
according to its size, weight, and/or resiliency (e.g., bounciness). For example, when a
particular type of absorbent media 124 having a specified size, weight, and/or resiliency
is selected, the frequency and/or amplitude of the vibrating mechanism 114 may be
altered for optimal movement of the absorbent media 124 in the bag 122. Embodiments
of the absorbent media 124 may serve as a desiccant to aid in sterilization by effectively
drawing moisture away from the waste material, thus reducing sanitary hazards typically
encountered with organic waste as well as minimizing odors generated by the waste
material.
           [0026] The amplitude and frequency may be altered in any suitable manner. For
example, the motor 136 may be a variable speed motor whose speed may be altered to
change the frequency while the amplitude may be altered by adjusting the angular
distance of the pin 138 from the axis of the shaft. For example, the control circuit 118
may display a user interface 512 (FIG. 5) for receiving user input associated with a
58110081.1                                     7

specified frequency and/or amplitude to be used according to a type of absorbent media
124 placed in the bag 122. Alternatively, the control circuit 118 may have one or more
switches that enable a user to select one or more frequencies and/or one or more
amplitudes with, or without, a displayed user-interface.
           [0027] In one embodiment, the bottom member 132 of the bowl 104 has a
conical shape, or other suitable shape, to urge the absorbent media and waste material
toward the center of the bowl under the force of gravity. For example, the conical shape
may be provided by a static tension force exerted on the bottom member 132 by the line
140. Nevertheless, the conical shape may be provided using any suitable technique. For
example, the bottom member 132 may be formed from a sheet of material (e.g., sheet
metal) that is resilient in consistency (e.g., spring-like) and formed into a conical shape
and perforated to allow airflow therethrough.
           [0028] In one embodiment, the lid 110 includes a hopper 134 for storing the
absorbent media 124. A latch door 144 or other selectively closable mechanism, is
provided to allow entry of the absorbent media 124 into the hopper 134, and an absorbent
media dispenser 146 is provided for transferring a specified amount of absorbent media
124 from the hopper 134 into the disposable bag 122 each time the toilet 100 is used. In
other embodiments, the toilet 100 may include a hopper placed at other locations, such as
behind the toilet, beside the toilet, or underneath the toilet.
           [0029] In one embodiment, the absorbent media dispenser 146 includes an auger
assembly having an auger 148 configured in the dispenser 146 that is in communication
with the inside of the lid 110. The auger is rotationally coupled to a motor 150 such that
when the motor is turned on, a specified amount of absorbent media 124 may be
dispensed into the disposable bag 122. In one embodiment, the dispenser 146 may be
hingedly affixed to the lid 110 such that it may be rotated to allow for closure of the lid
110.
           [0030] In one embodiment, the auger 148 may optionally have a sawtooth shape
or other suitable shape for grinding, chipping, shredding, pulverizing (e.g., breaking
apart) a concentrated amount of absorbent media 124 provided in block form (e.g., a
brick) into an expanded matrix for use in the toilet 100. Certain embodiments employing
absorbent media 124 provided as relatively small concentrated blocks may provide
58110081.1                                       R

certain advantages, such as a relatively smaller volume required for their storage prior to
use as well as their relative ease of use compared to absorbent media 124 provided in
expanded granular form. Although non-block forms of absorbent media may be used in
other embodiments.
           [0031] In another embodiment, the dispenser 146 may include a media retention
mechanism to inhibit or reduce unwanted absorbent media 124 when not needed or
desired, such as when the toilet 100 is not in use. For example, the exit or end of the
dispenser may include a spring-loaded valve that is biased in a closed position when
absorbent media 124 is not being actively discharged from the auger 148. As another
example, the motor 150 driving the auger 148 may be rotated in a backwards direction for
a specified period of time following dispensing of the absorbent media 124 such that any
absorbent media 124 still within the dispenser 146 may be driven back into the hopper
134.
           [0032] The disposable bag 122 is sized to fit within the bowl 104, and be made of
any suitable material (e.g., plastic, paper, etc.) that receives and holds absorbent media
124 and waste. In one embodiment, the disposable bag 122 is made of a material that can
decompose when processed using standard waste treatment techniques. The bag 122
includes an upper edge that may be releasably secured to the top member 106 of the toilet
100 using a suitable releasable securement mechanism. In one embodiment, the
releasable securement mechanism includes one or more tabs 142 configured on the top
member 106 of the toilet 100 on which the top edge of the bag 122 may be impaled for
holding the bag 122 in place. Other embodiments contemplate that other types of
releasable securement mechanisms may be used. For example, the releasable securement
mechanism may include a hook-and-loop (e.g., Velcro) strips molded into the top edge of
the disposable bag 122 and on the top member 106 of the toilet 100. For another
example, the releasable securement mechanism may include a bag 122 with a drawstring
or elastic member extending around the periphery of its edge for releasable securement to
the top member 106. For yet another example, the releasable securement mechanism
may include spring-loaded clips, or other mechanisms, that do not impale the disposable
bag 122.
           [0033] The toilet 100 may also include one or more sensors that may be used by
58110081.1                                      Q

the control circuit 118 to control its operation. For example, a lid position sensor 152
may be provided that senses when the lid 110 is moved from the closed to the open
position. A bag presence sensor 154 may be provided that senses when a bag 122 is
disposed within the bowl. Also, an absorbent media level sensor 156 may be provided to
sense the level of absorbent media 124 stored in the hopper 134. Also, an occupant
sensor 174 may be provided to sense when a user is occupying the toilet 100. Any
suitable types of sensors may be implemented with the sensors 152, 154, 156, 172, or
174. For example, the lid position sensor 152 may be a door switch, the bag presence
sensor 154 may be an optical sensor that detects differing levels of light when covered by
the bag 122, and the absorbent media sensor 156 may be a capacitive device that changes
its capacitance level when in contact with the absorbent media 124, and the occupant
sensor 174 may be a temperature sensor that senses the typical surface temperature of a
human body.
           [0034] In one embodiment, an ultraviolet lamp 170 and a humidity sensor 172
(e.g., hygrometer) may be included on the lower surface of the lid 110. The control
circuit 118 may function in response to signals obtained from the humidity sensor 172 to
control operation of the ultraviolet lamp 170 for various purposes, such as disinfection of
bacteria or other pathogens from the toilet 100 when not in use, or for a nightlight when
used at night. For example, the control circuit 118 may, using the humidity sensor 172,
sense when a moisture level in the toilet 100 has exceeded a specified threshold to
activate the ultraviolet lamp 170.
           [0035] Although FIG. 3 illustrates several example features of the toilet 100, it is
contemplated that other embodiments of the toilet 100 may have more, different, or fewer
features than those described herein. For example, the toilet 100 may include a lid 110
without a hopper 134 and/or dispenser 146 if manual entry of the absorbent media 124
into the disposable bag 122 is desired. For another example, the toilet 100 may be
provided without a seat 108 if not needed or desired. For yet another example, the toilet
100 may include a different type of agitation device than the vibrating mechanism 114 for
agitating the absorbent media 124, such as a solenoid physically coupled to the bottom
member 132 or one that will be described in detail below with reference to FIG. 4.
           [0036] FIG. 4 illustrates another absorbent media agitation device that may be
58110081.1                                      10

implemented with the toilet 100 according to another embodiment of the present
disclosure. As shown, the toilet 100A includes a housing 102A, a bowl 104A, a lid
11 A, a seat 108A, a vacuum pump 116A, a control circuit 118A, and a disposable bag
122A that are similar in design and construction to the housing 102, the bowl 104, the
seat 108, the lid 110, the vacuum pump 116, the control circuit 118, and the bag 122 of
FIG. 3. The toilet 100A of FIG. 4 differs, however, in that it includes an absorbent media
agitation device 158 formed from a disk 160 with an eccentrically mounted cam 162, that
is rotated by a motor 164. The absorbent media agitation device also includes multiple
levers 166 (e.g., four levers) that are equally or unequally spaced apart, and hingedly
affixed along the periphery of the bowl 104 via hinges 168. As the motor spins the cam
162, it interacts with multiple spaced-apart levers 166 to alternatively lift each lever 166
such that successive regions of the bottom member 132 are lifted for agitating the
absorbent media 124. Additionally, the bag 122A separates the absorbent media and
waste from the components of the toilet 1OOA so the waste material and absorbent media
do not contact (i.e., come into communication) with the agitation device.
           [0037] The media agitation device as shown in FIG. 4 may provide certain
advantages for use with the toilet 1OOA. For example, the levers 166 may provide for
enhanced vertical movement of the absorbent media at relatively lower frequencies than
what may be provided by a vibrating device, such as that described above with respect to
FIG. 3. Such agitation may be particularly beneficial when used with absorbent media
that is relatively soft in consistency and low in density, such as loose fill cellulose
typically used for insulating homes or other climatized structures.
           [0038] FIG. 5 illustrates one example of the control circuit 118 that may be used
to control the operation of the toilet 100 according to one embodiment of the present
disclosure. The control circuit 118 includes a processing system 502 that executes a toilet
management application 504 stored in a memory 506 (e.g., computer readable media).
Although the control circuit 118 is shown and described as a computer-based design
incorporating instructions stored in a memory 506 and executed by a processor 502, it
should be understood that the control circuit 118 may be embodied in other specific
forms, such as using discrete and/or integrated analog circuitry, field programmable gate
arrays (FPGAs), application specific integrated circuitry (ASICs), or any combination
58110081.1                                     11

thereof. Additionally, the control circuit 118 may be omitted if manual operation of the
toilet 100 is desired.
           [0039] The processing system 502 includes one or more processors or other
processing devices and memory. The one or more processors may process
machine/computer-readable executable instructions and data, and the memory may store
machine/computer-readable executable instructions and data including one or more
applications, including the application 504. A processor is hardware and memory is
hardware. The memory 506 includes random access memory (RAM) and/or other non
transitory memory, e.g., a non-transitory computer-readable medium such as one or more
flash disks or hard drives. The non-transitory memory may include any tangible
computer-readable medium including, for example, magnetic and/or optical disks, flash
drives, and the like.
           [0040] The control circuit 118 may also include a display 508, such as a liquid
crystal display (LCD), one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs), an LED display, a
touch screen, a capacitive display, or another display for displaying configuration settings
associated with the application 504. The control circuit 118 may also include an input
device 510, such as one or more buttons, switches, or other electro-mechanical device for
providing user input to the application 504. In one example, the display 508 and input
device 510 may include a touch screen display for receiving user input and displaying
one or more characteristics associated with operation of the application 504. In one
embodiment, the display 508 may include a user interface 512 for displaying information
to the user, and receiving user input from the user.
           [0041] In general, the processing system 502 executes a toilet operation
application 504 with one or more modules to control the operation of the toilet 100. In
certain embodiments, the application 504 may control all operating aspects of the toilet
100 described herein. In other embodiments, the application 504 may control only one or
a subset of the operating aspects of the toilet 100 described herein.
           [0042] A user interface module 514 facilitates the receipt of user data and/or other
communications from the input device 510 of the control circuit 118. In one example,
the control circuit 118 generates and executes the user interface 512 that displays an
interactive display such as the display 508, or other suitable user interface mechanism
58110081.1                                      12

including one or more selectable fields, editing screens, and the like for displaying status
information associated with one or more aspects of the application 504, such as
operational status information, power source (e.g., battery) condition, timer values to be
applied to the operation of the agitator, the vacuum pump, absorbent media dispenser,
and the like.
           [0043] A sensor interface module 516 monitors the various sensors 152, 154, 156,
and 172 configured on the toilet 100 and generates signals to be used by the one or more
other modules of the application 504 for administering the operation of the toilet 100.
For example, the sensor interface module 516 may continually monitor the lid position
sensor 152, and generate a signal that may be used by the agitator controller module 518
and/or vacuum pump controller module 520 for controlling the operation of the agitation
device (e.g., vibrating mechanism 114 or absorbent media agitation device 158), and/or
vacuum pump 116, respectively. As another example, the sensor interface module 516
may monitor the bag presence sensor 154, such as after the lid position sensor 152 detects
that the lid 110 has been opened and/or other times and generate a signal that may be
used by the alarm controller module 524 to generate an alarm if the bag 122 has not been
placed within the bowl 104 after a specified period of time. As yet another example, the
sensor interface module 516 may monitor the absorbent media level sensor 156 to
determine whether the level of the absorbent media 124 stored in the lid 110 has been
reduced to a specified level, and generate a signal that may be used by the alarm
controller module 524 when the level of the absorbent media is below the specified level.
As yet another example, the sensor interface module 516 may monitor the humidity
sensor 172 to selectively energize the ultraviolet lamp 170 according to a humidity level
inside of the bowl 104 or bowl 104/bag 122.
           [0044] An agitator controller module 518 is coupled to the agitation device (e.g.,
vibration mechanism 114, absorbent media agitation device 158, or other agitation
mechanism) and controls the operation of the agitation device, such as whether the
agitation device is on or off. For example, the agitator controller module 518 may
include a timer that turns the agitation device on or off after a specified period of time. In
one embodiment, the agitator controller module 518 may be configured to turn the
agitation device partially on, such as via a pulse width modulation (PWM) algorithm, that
58110081.1                                     1I

causes the agitation device to operate at a fraction of its fully on power. The vibrator
controller module 518 may include multiple partially on settings for optimizing the
agitation of different types of absorbent media having differing sizes, weights, and
resiliency.
           [0045] A vacuum pump controller module 520 controls the operation of the
vacuum pump 116. For example, the vacuum pump controller module 520 may receive
signals from the sensor interface module 516 indicating whether the lid 110 is in the open
position and whether the bag has been inserted into the bowl, and if so, turn on the
vacuum pump 116 so that the disposable bag 122 may be urged against the side of the
bowl 104. The vacuum pump controller module 520 may also be responsive to signals
from the user interface module 514 to turn off the pump in response to user input so that
the disposable bag 122 may be removed from the bowl 104 or to turn on the pump.
           [0046] An absorbent media dispensing module 522 controls the operation of the
absorbent media dispenser 146 to dispense absorbent media 124 from the hopper 134 to
the disposable bag 122. For example, the absorbent media dispensing module 522 may
receive signals from the sensor interface module 516 indicating whether the lid 110 is in
the open position and whether the bag has been inserted into the bowl, and if so, turn on
the dispenser 146 for a specified period of time so that a certain amount of absorbent
media 124 may be dispensed from the hopper 134 into the disposable bag 122 or due to
user-interface selection. For example, the absorbent media dispenser 146 may be
responsive to a switch and/or other control circuit 118 hardware to dispense absorbent
media into the disposable bag 122.
           [0047] An alarm controller module 524 communicates with the other modules
(e.g., the user interface module 514, the sensor interface module 516, the agitator
controller module 518, and the vacuum interface module 520) to receive signals
indicative of an alarm condition, and generate an alarm signal based on those signals.
For example, if the alarm controller module 524 receives a signal from the sensor
interface module 516 indicating that no bag 122 is present in the bowl 104 when the
absorbent media dispensing module 522 turns on the dispenser 146 to dispense absorbent
media 124, the alarm controller module 524 may generate an alarm and communicate
with the absorbent media dispenser controller 522 to turn off the dispenser 146 until a
58110081.1                                    14

bag 122 is placed in the bowl 104. As another example, the alarm controller module 524
may receive signals from the sensor interface module 516 indicating that the level of the
absorbent media 124 in the lid 110 is below a specified threshold level and generate an
alarm to alert the user that additional absorbent media 124 needs to be added to the
hopper 134.
           [0048] It should be appreciated that the modules described herein are provided
only as an example of a computing device that may execute the application 504 according
to the teachings of the present invention, and that other computing devices may have the
same modules, different modules, additional modules, or fewer modules than those
described herein. For example, one or more modules as described in FIG. 5 may be
combined into a single module. As another example, certain modules described herein
may be encoded and executed on other circuits, such as another circuit that is separate
from the control circuit 118.
           [0049] FIG. 6 illustrates an example process that may be performed by the
application 504 according to the teachings of the present disclosure to control the
operation of the toilet 100. Although the example process described herein below is
directed primarily to a computer-based application implemented in a memory and
executed by a processor, the steps described herein may also be applicable to other types
of control circuits, such as a digital or analog hardware circuit employing discrete
electrical components.
           [0050] Initially in step 601, the absorbent media hopper 134 may be loaded with
absorbent media 124 by moving the lid 110 to the open position, opening the access door
144, and pouring the absorbent media 124 into the absorbent media hopper 134. Also, an
air filter 172 may be placed over the outlet of the vacuum pump 116. Thereafter, the
toilet 100 and associated application 504 are ready for use.
           [0051] In step 602, the application 504 determines, using the absorbent media
level sensor 156, whether the absorbent media level is sufficient. If so, processing
continues at step 604; otherwise, processing continues at step 626 in which an alarm is
generated using a suitable output mechanism, such as the user interface 512 of the control
circuit 118. In one embodiment, the application 504 may also display a message on the
user interface 512 informing the user to add additional absorbent media to the absorbent
58110081.1                                       15

media hopper 134.
           [0052] In step 604, the application 504 receives a signal from the lid position
sensor 152 indicating that the lid 110 has been moved to the open position. Receipt of
the signal from the lid position sensor 152 typically indicates that the toilet is being
prepared for use.
           [0053] In step 606, the application 504 determines, using the occupant sensor
174, whether a signal has been received indicative of the user occupying the toilet 100
prior to a signal received from the bag sensor 154. If not, processing continues at step
608; otherwise processing continues at step 626 in which an alarm is generated to alert
the user that the toilet 100 is being improperly used. Additionally, the application 504
may generate, using the user interface 512 that a bag 122 should be installed prior to
occupying the toilet 100.
           [0054] In step 608, the application 504 controls the dispenser 146 to dispense a
specified amount of absorbent media into the bag 122. The specified amount of
absorbent media 124 may be set according to various factors, such as how long the
dispenser 146 is energized, the speed of the dispenser 146, and the weight and/or
granularity of the absorbent media 124. The application 504 may cause the dispenser 146
to immediately dispense the absorbent media, or it may wait for a specified period of time
(e.g., approximately 1 tol5 seconds) prior to having the absorbent media dispensed. For
example, the application 504 may be configured to wait for approximately 5 seconds after
the bag sensor 154 has detected the presence of the bag 122 to allow the user to
releasably secure the bag 122 to the bowl 104. In an alternative embodiment, the
application 504 may be responsive to user input inputted from either the user interface
512 or a switch mounted on the housing 102 to manually control the dispenser 146 for
dispensing the absorbent media.
           [0055] In steps 610 and 612, the application 504 turns on the agitation device
(e.g., vibration mechanism 114, absorbent media agitation device 158, or other agitation
mechanism) and the vacuum pump 116, respectively. For example, the application 504
may turn on the agitation device and/or vacuum pump 116 immediately after the
dispenser 146 has been turned off, or after a specified period of time after the dispenser
146 has been turned off or in response to one or more sensor inputs, such as the occupant
58110081.1                                      16

sensor 174 indicating the presence of an occupant or other sensor. In an alternative
embodiment, the application 504 may be responsive to user input inputted from either the
user interface 512 or one or more other switches mounted on the housing 102 to turn the
agitation device and/or vacuum pump 116 on. Additionally, the agitation device may be
turned on simultaneously with the vacuum pump 116 or at a different time from when the
vacuum pump 116 is turned on.
           [0056] In step 614, the application 504 receives a signal from the occupant sensor
174 indicating that the occupant no longer occupies the toilet 100. Thereafter, the
application 504 turns off the vibrating mechanism 114/absorbent media agitation
mechanism 158 and/or vacuum pump 116 in steps 616 and 618.
           [0057] In step 620, the application 504 determines whether a signal has been
received from the lid position sensor 152 indicating that the lid 110 has been moved to
the closed position prior to a signal received from the bag sensor 154 indicating that the
disposable bag 122 has been removed from the bowl 104. If not, processing continues at
step 622; otherwise processing continues at step 626 in which an alarm is generated to
alert the user that the bag 122 needs to be removed from the toilet 100. Additionally, the
application 504 may generate, using the user interface 512, that the bag 122 should be
removed from the bowl 104 prior to closing the lid 110.
           [0058] In step 622, the application 504 continually monitors the moisture level
inside the bowl 104 or the bag 122 if still inside the bowl 104 using the humidity sensor
172 to control operation of the ultraviolet lamp 170 when the toilet 100 is not in use. For
example, after use of the toilet 100, humidity levels inside the bowl 104 may remain at an
elevated level for an extended period of time, particularly if the bag 122 is inadvertently
left inside of the bowl 104. To maintain the toilet 100 in a sanitary condition, the
application 504 may activate the ultraviolet lamp 170 such that any pathogens, such as
germs and/or bacteria, may be reduced or eliminated.
           [0059] Processing continues for additional usage cycles of the toilet 100 as
described above with reference to steps 602 through 622. Nevertheless, when use of the
toilet 100 and associated application 504 are no longer needed or desired, the process
ends in step 624.
           [0060] Figure 7 illustrates an example computing system 700 that may implement
58110081.1                                      17

various systems, such as the control circuit 118, and methods discussed herein, such as
process 600. A general purpose computer system 700 is capable of executing a computer
program product to execute a computer process. Data and program files may be input to
the computer system 700, which reads the files and executes the programs therein such as
the application 504. Some of the elements of a general purpose computer system 700 are
shown in Figure 7 wherein a processing system 702 is shown having an input/output
(I/O) section 704, a hardware central processing unit (CPU) 706, and a memory section
708. The processing system 702 of the computer system 700 may have a single hardware
central-processing unit 706 or a plurality of hardware processing units. The computer
system 700 may be a conventional computer, a server, a distributed computer, or any
other type of computing device, such as one or more external computers made available
via a cloud computing architecture. The presently described technology is optionally
implemented in software devices loaded in memory 708, stored on a configured
DVD/CD-ROM 710 or storage unit 712, and/or communicated via a wired or wireless
network link 714, thereby transforming the computer system 700 in Figure 7 to a special
purpose machine for implementing the described operations.
           [0061] The memory section 708 may be volatile media, nonvolatile media,
removable media, non-removable media, and/or other hardware media or hardware
mediums that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computing device.
For example, the memory section 708 may include non-transitory computer storage
media and communication media. Non-transitory computer storage media further may
include volatile, nonvolatile, removable, and/or non-removable media implemented in a
method or technology for the storage (and retrieval) of information, such as
computer/machine-readable/executable instructions, data and data structures, engines,
program modules, and/or other data. Communication media may, for example, embody
computer/machine-readable/executable instructions, data structures, program modules,
algorithms, and/or other data. The communication media may also include a non
transitory information delivery technology. The communication media may include
wired and/or wireless connections and technologies and be used to transmit and/or
receive wired and/or wireless communications.
           [0062] The I/O section 704 is connected to one or more optional user-interface
58110081.1                                    1R

devices (e.g., a user interface such as a keyboard 716 or the user interface 512), an
optional disc storage unit 712, an optional display 718, and an optional disc drive unit
720. Generally, the disc drive unit 720 is a DVD/CD-ROM drive unit capable of reading
the DVD/CD-ROM medium 710, which typically contains programs and data 722.
Computer program products containing mechanisms to effectuate the systems and
methods in accordance with the presently described technology may reside in the
memory section 708, on a disc storage unit 712, on the DVD/CD-ROM medium 710 of
the computer system 700, or on external storage devices made available via a cloud
computing architecture with such computer program products, including one or more
database management products, web server products, application server products, and/or
other additional software components. Alternatively, a disc drive unit 720 may be
replaced or supplemented by a floppy drive unit, a tape drive unit, or other storage
medium drive unit. An optional network adapter 724 is capable of connecting the
computer system 700 to a network via the network link 714, through which the computer
system can receive instructions and data. Examples of such systems include personal
computers, Intel or PowerPC-based computing systems, AMD-based computing systems,
ARM-based computing systems, and other systems running a Windows-based, a UNIX
based, a mobile operating system, or other operating system. It should be understood that
computing systems may also embody devices such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs),
mobile phones, tablets or slates, multimedia consoles, gaming consoles, set top boxes,
etc.
           [0063] When used in a LAN-networking environment, the computer system 700
is connected (by wired connection and/or wirelessly) to a local network through the
network interface or adapter 724, which is one type of communications device. When
used in a WAN-networking environment, the computer system 700 typically includes a
modem, a network adapter, or any other type of communications device for establishing
communications over the wide area network. In a networked environment, program
modules depicted relative to the computer system 700 or portions thereof, may be stored
in a remote memory storage device. It is appreciated that the network connections shown
are examples of communications devices for and other means of establishing a
communications link between the computers may be used.
58110081.1                                    1Q

           [0064] In an example implementation, source code executed by the control circuit
118, a plurality of internal and external databases optionally are stored in memory of the
control circuit 118 or other storage systems, such as the disk storage unit 712 or the
DVD/CD-ROM medium 710, and/or other external storage devices made available and
accessible via a network architecture. The source code executed by the control circuit
118 may be embodied by instructions stored on such storage systems and executed by the
processing system 702.
           [0065] Some or all of the operations described herein may be performed by the
processing system 702, which is hardware. Further, local computing systems, remote
data sources and/or services, and other associated logic represent firmware, hardware,
and/or software configured to control operations the system 100 and/or other
components. The system set forth in Figure 7 is but one possible example of a computer
system that may employ or be configured in accordance with aspects of the present
disclosure.
           [0066] In the present disclosure, the methods disclosed may be implemented as
sets of instructions or software readable by a device. Further, it is understood that the
specific order or hierarchy of steps in the methods disclosed are instances of example
approaches. Based upon design preferences, it is understood that the specific order or
hierarchy of steps in the method can be rearranged while remaining within the disclosed
subject matter. The accompanying method claims present elements of the various steps
in a sample order, and are not necessarily meant to be limited to the specific order or
hierarchy presented.
           [0067] The described disclosure may be provided as a computer program product,
or software, that may include a non-transitory machine-readable medium having stored
thereon executable instructions, which may be used to program a computer system (or
other electronic devices) to perform a process according to the present disclosure. A non
transitory machine-readable medium includes any mechanism for storing information in a
