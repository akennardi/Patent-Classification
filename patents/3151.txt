Field
          10021 Pyridinone compounds, method of making such compounds, pharmaceutical
compositions and nedicaments comprising such compounds, and methods ofusing such compounds to
treat, prevent or diagnose diseases, disorders, or conditions associated with fibrosis are provided.
Descrtion
          10031    Fibrosis is the formation ofexcess fibrous connective tissue in an organ or tissue in a
reparativeorractive process Examples offibrosis include, but are not limited to pulmonary fibrosis,
liver fibrosis, dermal fibrosis, and renal fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis, also called idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (IPF), interstitial diffuse pulmonary fibrosis, inflanmatory pulmonary fibrosis, or fibrosing
alveolitis, is a lung disorder and a heergeneous group of conditions characterized by abnormal
formation offibrous tissue between alveoli caused by alveolitis comprising cellular infiltration into the
alveolar septae with resulting fibrosis. The effects oflPF are chronic, progressive, and often fatal
          10041 There continues to be a need for safe and effective dmugs to treat fibrotic conditions
such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

applications, published applications and other publications referenced herein are incorporated by
reference in their entirety unless stated otherwise. In the event that there are a plurality of definitions
for a term herein, those in this section prevail unless stated otherwise. As used in the specification
and the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the
context clearly dictates otherwise.       Unless otherwise indicated, conventional methods of mass
spectroscopy, NMR, HPLC, protein chemistry, biochemistry, recombinant DNA techniques and
pharmacology are employed.         The use of "or" or "and" means "and/or" unless stated otherwise.
Furthermore, use of the term "including" as well as other forms, such as "include", "includes," and
"included," is not limiting. As used in this specification, whether in a transitional phrase or in the
body of the claim, the terms "comprise(s)" and "comprising" are to be interpreted as having an open
ended meaning. That is, the terms are to be interpreted synonymously with the phrases "having at
least" or "including at least." When used in the context of a process, the term "comprising" means
that the process includes at least the recited steps, but may include additional steps. When used in
the context of a compound, composition, or device, the term "comprising" means that the compound,
composition, or device includes at least the recited features or components, but may also include
additional features or components.

        [0065]     An "aminoalkyl" group refers to an amino group connected via an alkylene group.
        [0066]     An "alkoxyalkyl" group refers to an alkoxy group connected via an alkylene
group, such as a "C2-8 alkoxyalkyl" and the like.
        [0067]     As used herein, a substituted group is derived from the unsubstituted parent group
in which there has been an exchange of one or more hydrogen atoms for another atom or group.
Unless otherwise indicated, when a group is deemed to be "substituted," it is meant that the group is
substituted with one or more substituents independently selected from C 1-C6 alkyl, C 1-C6 alkenyl,
C1-C6 alkynyl, C1 -C6 heteroalkyl, C3 -C 7 carbocyclyl (optionally substituted with halo, C1-C6 alkyl,
C1-C6 alkoxy, C1 -C6 haloalkyl, and C 1-C6 haloalkoxy), C 3-C7-carbocyclyl-C 1 -C6 -alkyl (optionally

membered heterocyclyl (optionally substituted with halo, C1-C              6  alkyl, C1-C   6  alkoxy, C1 -C6
haloalkyl, and C1-C6 haloalkoxy), 5-10 membered heterocyclyl-C1-C 6 -alkyl (optionally substituted

cyano, hydroxy,     C1-C 6   alkoxy, C1-C 6 alkoxy(CI-C 6 )alkyl       (i.e.,  ether), aryloxy, sulfhydryl
(mercapto), halo(C1-C 6 )alkyl (e.g., -CF 3), halo(CI-C 6 )alkoxy (e.g., -OCF 3), C1-C 6 alkylthio,

cyanato, isocyanato, thiocyanato, isothiocyanato, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, and oxo (=0).               Wherever a
group is described as "optionally substituted" that group can be substituted with the above
substituents.
        [0068]     It is to be understood that certain radical naming conventions can include either a
mono-radical or a di-radical, depending on the context. For example, where a substituent requires
two points of attachment to the rest of the molecule, it is understood that the substituent is a di
radical. For example, a substituent identified as alkyl that requires two points of attachment includes
                                                      -37-

di-radicals such as -CH 2 -, -CH 2CH 2-, -CH 2CH(CH 3)CH 2-, and the like.        Other radical naming
conventions clearly indicate that the radical is a di-radical such as "alkylene" or "alkenylene."
        [0069]      When two R groups are said to form a ring (e.g., a carbocyclyl, heterocyclyl, aryl,
or heteroaryl ring) "together with the atom to which they are attached," it is meant that the collective
unit of the atom and the two R groups are the recited ring. The ring is not otherwise limited by the
definition of each R group when taken individually. For example, when the following substructure
is present:
                                                           /R'
                                                         N
                                                               R2
and RI and R 2 are defined as selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl, or R1 and R 2
together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a heterocyclyl, it is meant that RI and R 2
can be selected from hydrogen or alkyl, or alternatively, the substructure has structure:
                                                    N A
where ring A is a heteroaryl ring containing the depicted nitrogen.
        [0070]      Similarly, when two "adjacent" R groups are said to form a ring "together with
the atom to which they are attached," it is meant that the collective unit of the atoms, intervening
bonds, and the two R groups are the recited ring. For example, when the following substructure is
present:
                                                                R1
                                                            CR2
and RI and R 2 are defined as selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl, or R1 and R 2
together with the atoms to which they are attached form an aryl or carbocylyl, it is meant that RI and
R2  can be selected from hydrogen or alkyl, or alternatively, the substructure has structure:
                                                        A
                                                   -38-

where A is an aryl ring or a carbocylyl containing the depicted double bond.
        [0071]      Wherever a substituent is depicted as a di-radical (i.e., has two points of
attachment to the rest of the molecule), it is to be understood that the substituent can be attached in
any directional configuration unless otherwise indicated. Thus, for example, a substituent depicted
as -AE- or        A     E        includes the substituent being oriented such that the A is attached at the
leftmost attachment point of the molecule as well as the case in which A is attached at the rightmost
attachment point of the molecule.
        [0072]      As used herein, "isosteres" of a chemical group are other chemical groups that
exhibit the same or similar properties.         For example, tetrazole is an isostere of carboxylic acid
because it mimics the properties of carboxylic acid even though they both have very different
molecular formulae. Tetrazole is one of many possible isosteric replacements for carboxylic acid.
Other carboxylic acid isosteres contemplated include -SO 3H, -SO 2HNR, -P0 2(R)2, -P0 3(R)2,
CONHNHSO 2R, -COHNSO 2R, and -CONRCN, where R is selected from hydrogen, C1_6 alkyl, C2-6
alkenyl, C 2_6 alkynyl, C 3_7 carbocyclyl, C6 _10 aryl, 5-10 membered heteroaryl, and 5-10 membered
heterocyclyl, as defined herein. In addition, carboxylic acid isosteres can include 5-7 membered
carbocycles or heterocycles containing any combination of CH 2, 0, S, or N in any chemically stable
oxidation state, where any of the atoms of said ring structure are optionally substituted in one or
more positions. The following structures are non-limiting examples of carbocyclic and heterocyclic
isosteres contemplated. The atoms of said ring structure may be optionally substituted at one or
more positions with R as defined above.

        [0073]      It is also contemplated that when chemical substituents are added to a carboxylic
isostere, the compound retains the properties of a carboxylic isostere. It is contemplated that when a

carboxylic isostere is optionally substituted with one or more moieties selected from R as defined
above, then the substitution and substitution position is selected such that it does not eliminate the
carboxylic acid isosteric properties of the compound.      Similarly, it is also contemplated that the
placement of one or more R substituents upon a carbocyclic or heterocyclic carboxylic acid isostere
is not a substitution at one or more atom(s) that maintain(s) or is/are integral to the carboxylic acid
isosteric properties of the compound, if such substituent(s) would destroy the carboxylic acid
isosteric properties of the compound.
         [0074]     Other carboxylic acid isosteres not specifically exemplified in this specification
are also contemplated.
         [0075]     "Subject" as used herein, means a human or a non-human mammal, e.g., a dog, a
cat, a mouse, a rat, a cow, a sheep, a pig, a goat, a non-human primate or a bird, e.g., a chicken, as
well as any other vertebrate or invertebrate.
         [0076]     The term "mammal" is used in its usual biological sense. Thus, it specifically
includes, but is not limited to, primates, including simians (chimpanzees, apes, monkeys) and
humans, cattle, horses, sheep, goats, swine, rabbits, dogs, cats, rodents, rats, mice guinea pigs, or the
like.
         [0077]     The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" or "pharmaceutically acceptable
excipient" includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal
agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for
pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional
media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is
contemplated. In addition, various adjuvants such as are commonly used in the art may be included.
Considerations for the inclusion of various components in pharmaceutical compositions are
described, e.g., in Gilman et al. (Eds.) (1990); Goodman and Gilman's: The Pharmacological Basis
of Therapeutics, 8th Ed., Pergamon Press.
         [0078]     A therapeutic effect relieves, to some extent, one or more of the symptoms of a
disease or condition, and includes curing a disease or condition. "Curing" means that the symptoms
of a disease or condition are eliminated; however, certain long-term or permanent effects may exist
even after a cure is obtained (such as extensive tissue damage).
         [0079]     "Treat," "treatment," or "treating," as used herein refers to administering a
compound or pharmaceutical composition to a subject for prophylactic and/or therapeutic purposes.
The term "prophylactic treatment" refers to treating a subject who does not yet exhibit symptoms of
a disease or condition, but who is susceptible to, or otherwise at risk of, a particular disease or
                                                   -40-

condition, whereby the treatment reduces the likelihood that the patient will develop the disease or
condition. The term "therapeutic treatment" refers to administering treatment to a subject already
suffering from a disease or condition.
         [0080]    Where the compounds disclosed herein have at least one chiral center, they may
exist as individual enantiomers and diastereomers or as mixtures of such isomers, including
racemates. Separation of the individual isomers or selective synthesis of the individual isomers is
accomplished by application of various methods which are well known to practitioners in the art.
Unless otherwise indicated, all such isomers and mixtures thereof are included in the scope of the
compounds disclosed herein. Furthermore, compounds disclosed herein may exist in one or more
crystalline or amorphous forms. Unless otherwise indicated, all such forms are included in the scope
of the compounds disclosed herein including any polymorphic forms.         In addition, some of the
compounds disclosed herein may form solvates with water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic
solvents. Unless otherwise indicated, such solvates are included in the scope of the compounds
disclosed herein.
         [0081]    The skilled artisan will recognize that some structures described herein may be
resonance forms or tautomers of compounds that may be fairly represented by other chemical
structures, even when kinetically; the artisan recognizes that such structures may only represent a
very small portion of a sample of such compound(s).      Such compounds are considered within the
scope of the structures depicted, though such resonance forms or tautomers are not represented
herein.
         [0082]    Isotopes may be present in the compounds described. Each chemical element as
represented in a compound structure may include any isotope of said element. For example, in a
compound structure a hydrogen atom may be explicitly disclosed or understood to be present in the
compound. At any position of the compound that a hydrogen atom may be present, the hydrogen
atom can be any isotope of hydrogen, including but not limited to hydrogen-i (protium) and
hydrogen-2 (deuterium). Thus, reference herein to a compound encompasses all potential isotopic
forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

Administration and PharmaceuticalCompositions
        [0232]      Some embodiments include pharmaceutical compositions comprising: (a) a safe
and therapeutically effective amount of a compound described herein (including enantiomers,
diastereoisomers, tautomers, polymorphs, and solvates thereof), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts
thereof; and (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, excipient or combination thereof.
        [0233]      The compounds are administered at a therapeutically effective dosage, e.g., a
dosage sufficient to provide treatment for the disease states previously described. While human
dosage levels have yet to be optimized for the compounds of the preferred embodiments, generally, a
daily dose for most of the compounds described herein is from about 0.25 mg/kg to about 120 mg/kg
or more of body weight, from about 0.5 mg/kg or less to about 70 mg/kg, from about 1.0 mg/kg to
about 50 mg/kg of body weight, or from about 1.5 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of body weight. Thus,
for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would be from about 17 mg per day to about
8000 mg per day, from about 35 mg per day or less to about 7000 mg per day or more, from about
70 mg per day to about 6000 mg per day, from about 100 mg per day to about 5000 mg per day, or
from about 200 mg to about 3000 mg per day. The amount of active compound administered will, of
course, be dependent on the subject and disease state being treated, the severity of the affliction, the
manner and schedule of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician.
        [0234]      Administration of the compounds disclosed herein or the pharmaceutically
acceptable salts thereof can be via any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve
similar utilities including, but not limited to, orally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intranasally,
topically, transdermally, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, intrapulmonarilly, vaginally, rectally, or
intraocularly. Oral and parenteral administrations are customary in treating the indications that are
the subject of the preferred embodiments.
        [0235]      The compounds useful as described above can be formulated into pharmaceutical
compositions for use in treatment of these conditions. Standard pharmaceutical formulation
                                                  -132-

techniques are used, such as those disclosed in Remington's The Science and Practice of Pharmacy,
21st Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (2005), incorporated by reference in its entirety.
         [0236]     In addition to the selected compound useful as described above, come
embodiments include compositions containing a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. The term
"pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier", as used herein, means one or more compatible solid or liquid
filler diluents or encapsulating substances, which are suitable for administration to a mammal. The
term "compatible", as used herein, means that the components of the composition are capable of
being commingled with the subject compound, and with each other, in a manner such that there is no
interaction, which would substantially reduce the pharmaceutical efficacy of the composition under
ordinary use situations. Pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers must, of course, be of sufficiently high
purity and sufficiently low toxicity to render them suitable for administration preferably to an
animal, preferably mammal being treated.
         [0237]     Some examples of substances, which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable
carriers or components thereof, are sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as
corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose,
ethyl cellulose, and methyl cellulose; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; solid lubricants, such
as stearic acid and magnesium stearate; calcium sulfate; vegetable oils, such as peanut oil,
cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and oil of theobroma; polyols such as propylene glycol,
glycerine, sorbitol, mannitol, and polyethylene glycol; alginic acid; emulsifiers, such as the
TWEENS; wetting agents, such sodium lauryl sulfate; coloring agents; flavoring agents; tableting
agents, stabilizers; antioxidants; preservatives; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; and phosphate
buffer solutions.
         [0238]     The choice of a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier to be used in conjunction
with the subject compound is basically determined by the way the compound is to be administered.
         [0239]     The compositions described herein are preferably provided in unit dosage form.
As used herein, a "unit dosage form" is a composition containing an amount of a compound that is
suitable for administration to an animal, preferably mammal subject, in a single dose, according to
good medical practice. The preparation of a single or unit dosage form however, does not imply that
the dosage form is administered once per day or once per course of therapy. Such dosage forms are
contemplated to be administered once, twice, thrice or more per day and may be administered as
infusion over a period of time (e.g., from about 30 minutes to about 2-6 hours), or administered as a
continuous infusion, and may be given more than once during a course of therapy, though a single
administration is not specifically excluded. The skilled artisan will recognize that the formulation
                                                  -133-

does not specifically contemplate the entire course of therapy and such decisions are left for those
skilled in the art of treatment rather than formulation.
        [0240]       The compositions useful as described above may be in any of a variety of suitable
forms for a variety of routes for administration, for example, for oral, nasal, rectal, topical (including
transdermal), ocular, intracerebral, intracranial, intrathecal, intra-arterial, intravenous, intramuscular,
or other parental routes of administration.      The skilled artisan will appreciate that oral and nasal
compositions include compositions that are administered by inhalation, and made using available
methodologies.      Depending upon the particular route of administration desired, a variety of
pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers well-known in the art may be used.                   Pharmaceutically
acceptable carriers include, for example, solid or liquid fillers, diluents, hydrotropies, surface-active
agents, and encapsulating substances. Optional pharmaceutically-active materials may be included,
which do not substantially interfere with the inhibitory activity of the compound. The amount of
carrier employed in conjunction with the compound is sufficient to provide a practical quantity of
material for administration per unit dose of the compound. Techniques and compositions for making
dosage forms useful in the methods described herein are described in the following references, all
incorporated by reference herein: Modern Pharmaceutics, 4th Ed., Chapters 9 and 10 (Banker &
Rhodes, editors, 2002); Lieberman et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets (1989); and Ansel,
Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms 8th Edition (2004).
        [0241]      Various oral dosage forms can be used, including such solid forms as tablets,
capsules, granules and bulk powders. Tablets can be compressed, tablet triturates, enteric-coated,
sugar-coated, film-coated, or multiple-compressed, containing suitable binders, lubricants, diluents,
disintegrating agents, coloring agents, flavoring agents, flow-inducing agents, and melting agents.
Liquid oral dosage forms include aqueous solutions, emulsions, suspensions, solutions and/or
suspensions     reconstituted    from    non-effervescent   granules,    and     effervescent  preparations
reconstituted from effervescent granules, containing suitable solvents, preservatives, emulsifying
agents, suspending agents, diluents, sweeteners, melting agents, coloring agents and flavoring
agents.
        [0242]       The pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers suitable for the preparation of unit
dosage forms for peroral administration is well-known in the art.               Tablets typically comprise
conventional pharmaceutically-compatible adjuvants as inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate,
sodium carbonate, mannitol, lactose and cellulose; binders such as starch, gelatin and sucrose;
disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and croscarmelose; lubricants such as magnesium stearate,
stearic acid and talc. Glidants such as silicon dioxide can be used to improve flow characteristics of
                                                   -134-

the powder mixture.        Coloring agents, such as the FD&C dyes, can be added for appearance.
Sweeteners and flavoring agents, such as aspartame, saccharin, menthol, peppermint, and fruit
flavors, are useful adjuvants for chewable tablets. Capsules typically comprise one or more solid
diluents disclosed above. The selection of carrier components depends on secondary considerations
like taste, cost, and shelf stability, which are not critical, and can be readily made by a person skilled
in the art.
         [0243]      Peroral compositions also include liquid solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and
the like. The pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers suitable for preparation of such compositions are
well known in the art. Typical components of carriers for syrups, elixirs, emulsions and suspensions
include ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, liquid sucrose, sorbitol and water.
For a suspension, typical suspending agents include methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl
cellulose, AVICEL RC-591, tragacanth and sodium alginate; typical wetting agents include lecithin
and polysorbate 80; and typical preservatives include methyl paraben and sodium benzoate. Peroral
liquid compositions may also contain one or more components such as sweeteners, flavoring agents
and colorants disclosed above.
         [0244]      Such compositions may also be coated by conventional methods, typically with
pH or time-dependent coatings, such that the subject compound is released in the gastrointestinal
tract in the vicinity of the desired topical application, or at various times to extend the desired action.
Such dosage forms typically include, but are not limited to, one or more of cellulose acetate
phthalate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate, ethyl cellulose,
Eudragit coatings, waxes and shellac.
         [0245]      Compositions described herein may optionally include other drug actives.
         [0246]      Other compositions useful for attaining systemic delivery of the subject
compounds include sublingual, buccal and nasal dosage forms.                 Such compositions typically
comprise one or more of soluble filler substances such as sucrose, sorbitol and mannitol; and binders
such as acacia, microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl
cellulose. Glidants, lubricants, sweeteners, colorants, antioxidants and flavoring agents disclosed
above may also be included.
         [0247]      A liquid composition, which is formulated for topical ophthalmic use, is
formulated such that it can be administered topically to the eye. The comfort should be maximized
as much as possible, although sometimes formulation considerations (e.g. drug stability) may
necessitate less than optimal comfort. In the case that comfort cannot be maximized, the liquid
should be formulated such that the liquid is tolerable to the patient for topical ophthalmic use.
                                                    -135-

Additionally, an ophthalmically acceptable liquid should either be packaged for single use, or
contain a preservative to prevent contamination over multiple uses.
        [0248]      For ophthalmic application, solutions or medicaments are often prepared using a
physiological saline solution as a major vehicle.         Ophthalmic solutions should preferably be
maintained at a comfortable pH with an appropriate buffer system. The formulations may also
contain conventional, pharmaceutically acceptable preservatives, stabilizers and surfactants.
        [0249]      Preservatives that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed
herein include, but are not limited to, benzalkonium chloride, PHMB, chlorobutanol, thimerosal,
phenylmercuric, acetate and phenylmercuric nitrate. A useful surfactant is, for example, Tween 80.
Likewise, various useful vehicles may be used in the ophthalmic preparations disclosed herein.
These vehicles include, but are not limited to, polyvinyl alcohol, povidone, hydroxypropyl methyl
cellulose, poloxamers, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose and purified water.
        [0250]      Tonicity adjustors may be added as needed or convenient. They include, but are
not limited to, salts, particularly sodium chloride, potassium chloride, mannitol and glycerin, or any
other suitable ophthalmically acceptable tonicity adjustor.
        [0251]      Various buffers and means for adjusting pH may be used so long as the resulting
preparation is ophthalmically acceptable. For many compositions, the pH will be between 4 and 9.
Accordingly, buffers include acetate buffers, citrate buffers, phosphate buffers and borate buffers.
Acids or bases may be used to adjust the pH of these formulations as needed.
        [0252]      In a similar vein, an ophthalmically acceptable antioxidant includes, but is not
limited to, sodium metabisulfite, sodium thiosulfate, acetylcysteine, butylated hydroxyanisole and
butylated hydroxytoluene.
        [0253]      Other excipient components, which may be included in the ophthalmic
preparations, are chelating agents. A useful chelating agent is edetate disodium, although other
chelating agents may also be used in place or in conjunction with it.
        [0254]      For topical use, creams, ointments, gels, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing
the compound disclosed herein are employed. Topical formulations may generally be comprised of a
pharmaceutical carrier, co-solvent, emulsifier, penetration enhancer, preservative system, and
emollient.
        [0255]      For intravenous administration, the compounds and compositions described
herein may be dissolved or dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, such as a saline or
dextrose solution. Suitable excipients may be included to achieve the desired pH, including but not
limited to NaOH, sodium carbonate, sodium acetate, HCl, and citric acid. In various embodiments,
                                                  -136-

the pH of the final composition ranges from 2 to 8, or preferably from 4 to 7. Antioxidant excipients
may include sodium bisulfite, acetone sodium bisulfite, sodium formaldehyde, sulfoxylate, thiourea,
and EDTA.      Other non-limiting examples of suitable excipients found in the final intravenous
composition may include sodium or potassium phosphates, citric acid, tartaric acid, gelatin, and
carbohydrates such as dextrose, mannitol, and dextran. Further acceptable excipients are described
in Powell, et al., Compendium of Excipients for Parenteral Formulations, PDA J Pharm Sci and
Tech 1998, 52 238-311 and Nema et al., Excipients and Their Role in Approved Injectable Products:
Current Usage and Future Directions, PDA JPharmSci and Tech 2011, 65 287-332, both of which
are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Antimicrobial agents may also be included to
achieve a bacteriostatic or fungistatic solution, including but not limited to phenylmercuric nitrate,
thimerosal, benzethonium chloride, benzalkonium chloride, phenol, cresol, and chlorobutanol.
        [0256]      The compositions for intravenous administration may be provided to caregivers in
the form of one more solids that are reconstituted with a suitable diluent such as sterile water, saline
or dextrose in water shortly prior to administration. In other embodiments, the compositions are
provided in solution ready to administer parenterally. In still other embodiments, the compositions
are provided in a solution that is further diluted prior to administration. In embodiments that include
administering a combination of a compound described herein and another agent, the combination
may be provided to caregivers as a mixture, or the caregivers may mix the two agents prior to
administration, or the two agents may be administered separately.
        [0257]      The actual dose of the active compounds described herein depends on the specific
compound, and on the condition to be treated; the selection of the appropriate dose is well within the
knowledge of the skilled artisan.
Method of Treatment
        [0258]      Some embodiments described herein relate to a method of treating a fibrotic
condition, which can include administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound
disclosed herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to a subject. The methods include
identifying a subject at risk for or having a fibrotic condition and administering a compound to the
subject in an effective amount for therapeutic treatment or prophylactic treatment of the fibrotic
condition.
        [0259]      A    "fibrotic    condition,"  "fibroproliferative  condition,"  "fibrotic  disease,"
"fibroproliferative   disease,"    "fibrotic  disorder,"  and "fibroproliferative   disorder"  are used
interchangeably to refer to a condition, disease or disorder that is characterized by dysregulated
                                                    -137-

proliferation or activity of fibroblasts and/or abnormal accumulation of fibronectin and/or pathologic
or excessive accumulation of collagenous tissue. Typically, any such disease, disorder or condition is
amenable to treatment by administration of a compound having anti-fibrotic activity. Fibrotic
disorders include, but are not limited to, pulmonary fibrosis, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF) and pulmonary fibrosis from a known etiology, dermal fibrosis, pancreatic fibrosis, liver
fibrosis (e.g., hepatic fibrosis associated with chronic active hepatitis), and renal fibrosis.
         [0260]      In some embodiments, the subject is a human.
         [0261]      The terms "therapeutically effective amount," as used herein, refer to an amount
of a compound sufficient to cure, ameliorate, slow progression of, prevent, or reduce the likelihood
of onset of the identified disease or condition, or to exhibit a detectable therapeutic, prophylactic, or
inhibitory effect. The effect can be detected by, for example, the assays disclosed in the following
examples. The precise effective amount for a subject will depend upon the subject's body weight,
size, and health; the nature and extent of the condition; and the therapeutic or combination of
therapeutics selected for administration. Therapeutically and prophylactically effective amounts for a
given situation can be determined by routine experimentation that is within the skill and judgment of
the clinician.
         [0262]      For any compound, the therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount can
be estimated initially either in cell culture assays, e.g., of neoplastic cells, or in animal models,
usually rats, mice, rabbits, dogs, or pigs. The animal model may also be used to determine the
appropriate concentration range and route of administration. Such information can then be used to
determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans.
         [0263]      Therapeutic/prophylactic efficacy and toxicity may be determined by standard
pharmaceutical procedures        in cell cultures or experimental        animals, e.g.,    ED 50 (the dose
therapeutically effective in 50% of the population) and LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the
population). The dose ratio between therapeutic and toxic effects is the therapeutic index, and it can
be expressed as the ratio, ED 50 /LD5 0. Pharmaceutical compositions that exhibit large therapeutic
indices are preferred. However, pharmaceutical compositions that exhibit narrow therapeutic indices
are also within the scope of the invention. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal
studies may be used in formulating a range of dosage for human use. The dosage contained in such
compositions is preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include an ED 50 with
little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form
employed, sensitivity of the patient, and the route of administration.

        [0264]      The exact dosage will be determined by the practitioner, in light of factors related
to the subject that requires treatment. Dosage and administration are adjusted to provide sufficient
levels of the active agent(s) or to maintain the desired effect. Factors which may be taken into
account include the severity of the disease state, general health of the subject, age, weight, and
gender of the subject, diet, time and frequency of administration, drug combination(s), reaction
sensitivities, and tolerance/response to therapy. Long-acting pharmaceutical compositions may be
administered every 3 to 4 days, every week, or once every two weeks depending on half-life and
clearance rate of the particular formulation.
        [0265]      In one aspect, treating a condition described herein results in an increase in
average survival time of a population of treated subjects in comparison to a population of untreated
subjects. Preferably, the average survival time is increased by more than about 30 days; more
preferably, by more than about 60 days; more preferably, by more than about 90 days; and even
more preferably by more than about 120 days. An increase in survival time of a population may be
measured by any reproducible means. In a preferred aspect, an increase in average survival time of a
population may be measured, for example, by calculating for a population the average length of
survival following initiation of treatment with an active compound. In an another preferred aspect,
an increase in average survival time of a population may also be measured, for example, by
calculating for a population the average length of survival following completion of a first round of
treatment with an active compound.
        [0266]      In another aspect, treating a condition described herein results in a decrease in the
mortality rate of a population of treated subjects in comparison to a population of subjects receiving
carrier alone. In another aspect, treating a condition described herein results in a decrease in the
mortality rate of a population of treated subjects in comparison to an untreated population. In a
further aspect, treating a condition described herein results a decrease in the mortality rate of a
population of treated subjects in comparison to a population receiving monotherapy with a drug that
is not a compound of the embodiments, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, metabolite, analog or
derivative thereof. Preferably, the mortality rate is decreased by more than about 2%; more
preferably, by more than about 5%; more preferably, by more than about 10%; and most preferably,
by more than about 25%. In a preferred aspect, a decrease in the mortality rate of a population of
treated subjects may be measured by any reproducible means. In another preferred aspect, a decrease
in the mortality rate of a population may be measured, for example, by calculating for a population
the average number of disease-related deaths per unit time following initiation of treatment with an
active compound. In another preferred aspect, a decrease in the mortality rate of a population may
                                                  -139-

also be measured, for example, by calculating for a population the average number of disease related
deaths per unit time following completion of a first round of treatment with an active compound.
        [0267]       In another aspect, treating a condition described herein results in a reduction in
the rate of cellular proliferation. Preferably, after treatment, the rate of cellular proliferation is
reduced by at least about 5%; more preferably, by at least about 10%; more preferably, by at least
about 20%; more preferably, by at least about 30%; more preferably, by at least about 40%; more
preferably, by at least about 50%; even more preferably, by at least about 60%; and most preferably,
by at least about 75%. The rate of cellular proliferation may be measured by any reproducible means
of measurement. In a preferred aspect, the rate of cellular proliferation is measured, for example, by
measuring the number of dividing cells in a tissue sample per unit time.
        [0268]       In another aspect, treating a condition described herein results in a reduction in
the proportion of proliferating cells. Preferably, after treatment, the proportion of proliferating cells
is reduced by at least about 5%; more preferably, by at least about 10%; more preferably, by at least
about 20%; more preferably, by at least about 30%; more preferably, by at least about 40%; more
preferably, by at least about 50%; even more preferably, by at least about 60%; and most preferably,
by at least about 75%. The proportion of proliferating cells may be measured by any reproducible
means of measurement. In a preferred aspect, the proportion of proliferating cells is measured, for
example, by quantifying the number of dividing cells relative to the number of nondividing cells in a
tissue sample. In another preferred aspect, the proportion of proliferating cells is equivalent to the
mitotic index.
        [0269]       In another aspect, treating a condition described herein results in a decrease in
size of an area or zone of cellular proliferation. Preferably, after treatment, size of an area or zone of
cellular proliferation is reduced by at least 5% relative to its size prior to treatment; more preferably,
reduced by at least about 10%; more preferably, reduced by at least about 20%; more preferably,
reduced by at least about 30%; more preferably, reduced by at least about 40%; more preferably,
reduced by at least about 50%; even more preferably, reduced by at least about 60%; and most
preferably, reduced by at least about 75%. Size of an area or zone of cellular proliferation may be
measured by any reproducible means of measurement. In a preferred aspect, size of an area or zone
of cellular proliferation may be measured as a diameter or width of an area or zone of cellular
proliferation.
        [0270]       The methods described herein may include identifying a subject in need of
treatment. In a preferred embodiment, the methods include identifying a mammal in need of
treatment. In a highly preferred embodiment, the methods include identifying a human in need of
                                                   -140-

treatment. Identifying a subject in need of treatment may be accomplished by any means that
indicates a subject who may benefit from treatment. For example, identifying a subject in need of
treatment may occur by clinical diagnosis, laboratory testing, or any other means known to one of
skill in the art, including any combination of means for identification.
         [0271]       As described elsewhere herein, the compounds described herein may be
formulated in pharmaceutical compositions, if desired, and can be administered by any route that
permits treatment of the disease or condition. A preferred route of administration is oral
administration. Administration may take the form of single dose administration, or the compound of
the embodiments can be administered over a period of time, either in divided doses or in a
continuous-release formulation or administration method (e.g., a pump). However the compounds of
the embodiments are administered to the subject, the amounts of compound administered and the
route of administration chosen should be selected to permit efficacious treatment of the disease
condition.
         [0272]       Further embodiments include administering a combination of compounds to a
subject in need thereof. A combination can include a compound, composition, pharmaceutical
composition described herein with an additional medicament.
         [0273]       Some embodiments include co-administering a compound, composition, and/or
pharmaceutical      composition described herein, with an additional medicament.             By "co
administration," it is meant that the two or more agents may be found in the patient's bloodstream at
the same time, regardless of when or how they are actually administered. In some embodiments, the
agents are administered simultaneously.         In some such such embodiments, administration in
combination is accomplished by combining the agents in a single dosage form.                 In some
embodiments, the agents are administered sequentially.         In some embodiments the agents are
administered through the same route, such as orally.      In some other embodiments, the agents are
administered through different routes, such as one being administered orally and another being
administered i.v.      Thus, for example, the combination of active ingredients may be: (1) co
formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined formulation; (2) delivered
by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by any other combination therapy
regimen known in the art. When delivered in alternation therapy, the methods described herein may
comprise administering or delivering the active ingredients sequentially, e.g., in separate solution,
emulsion, suspension, tablets, pills or capsules, or by different injections in separate syringes. In
general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered
sequentially, i.e., serially, whereas in simultaneous therapy, effective dosages of two or more active
                                                  -141-

ingredients are administered together. Various sequences of intermittent combination therapy may
also be used.
         Pulmonary Fibrosis
         [0274]     Pulmonary fibrosis also called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), interstitial
diffuse pulmonary fibrosis, inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis, or fibrosing alveolitis, is a lung
disorder and a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by abnormal formation of fibrous
tissue between alveoli caused by alveolitis comprising cellular infiltration into the alveolar septae
with resulting fibrosis. The effects of IPF are chronic, progressive, and often fatal. The compounds
and methods described herein are useful in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis, such as IPF.
         Renal Fibrosis
         [0275]     Irrespective of the nature of the initial insult, renal fibrosis is considered to be the
common final pathway by which kidney disease progresses to end-stage renal failure. The
compounds and methods described herein are useful in the treatment of renal fibrosis.
Synthesis
         [0276]     The compounds disclosed herein may be synthesized by methods described
below, or by modification of these methods. Ways of modifying the methodology include, among
others, temperature, solvent, reagents etc., known to those skilled in the art. In general, during any
of the processes for preparation of the compounds disclosed herein, it may be necessary and/or
desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be

        [1143]         To a mixture of XLVII-1 (8.2 g, 50 mmol, 1 eq) in DMF (60 mL) was added
XLVII-2 (13.1 g, 75 mmol, 1.5 eq), K2 CO 3 (11.0 g, 80 mmol, 1.6 eq) and Nal (1.4 g, 9.3 mmol, 0.18
eq). The resulting mixture was refluxed for 4 h under N 2 . Then the mixture was cooled to rt and
diluted with H20 and extracted with EA. The combined organic phase was washed with brine, dried
over Na 2SO 4 , and filtrated. EA was evaporated to allow solid precipitate out. The solid was filtered,
and the filter cake was washed with PE to give the pure XLVII-3 (11.2 g, 70%) as a brown solid.
The filtrate was concentrated and purified by flash column chromatography (PE:EA=10:1A :1) to
afford the XLVII-3'(1.7 g, 10.6%) as a yellow oil.
        [1144]         The mixture of XLVII-3 (9.85 g, 31 mmol, 1 eq) and reductive iron power (5.2 g,
93 mmol, 3 eq) in 80 mL of 50% EtOH was heated to reflux, conc.HCl (0.34 mL, 4 mmol) was
added dropwise, then the mixture was refluxed for 4h. Then the mixture was cooled to rt, filtered,
washed the filter cake with EA, the filtrate was washed with brine, dried over Na 2 SO 4, and
concentrated to afford XLVII-4 (8.9 g, crude yield 100%).

        [1145]     The mixture of XLVII-4 (6.0 g, 20.8 mmol, 1 eq), chloroethanol (20 mL, 300
mmol, 14.4 eq) and K 2CO 3 (5.75 g, 41.6 mmol, 2 eq) in DMF (50 mL) was stirred at 130'C for 28h.
After the mixture was cooled to rt, diluted with H20, and extracted with EA, the filtrate was
concentrated and the residue was purified to afford XLVII-5 (2.5 g, 36 % ) as a yellow solid.
        [1146]     The mixture of XLVII-5 (2.0 g, 6 mmol, 1 eq), SOCl 2 (0.65 mL, 9 mmol, 1.5 eq)
and Et 3N (1.3 mL, 9 mmol, 1.5 eq) in DCM (50 mL) was stirred at rt for 28h under N 2 . The reaction
was then quenched with H 20, extracted with EA, the filtrate was concentrated and the residue was
purified to produce XLVII-6 (1.5 g, 71 %) as a yellow solid.
        [1147]     The mixture of XLVII-6 (900 mg, 2.6 mmol, 1 eq), XLVII-7 (1.2 g, 7.8 mmol, 3
eq) and Nal (30 mg, catalytic amount) in CH 3 CN (50 mL) was refluxed for 16h under N 2 . The
solvent was then removed and the resulting residue was purified to give Compound 709 (420 mg,
37%) as a yellow colloid substance. 'H NMR (CDCl 3, 400 MHz) 6 7.61 (s, 1H), 7.51 (dd, J=2.6,

Assay of InhibitorvEffect on TGF-b induced Endothelin-] Production
        [1148]     Fibroblasts (primary human lung and dermal, HFL-1, 3T3 etc) are seeded in 96
well plates at ~15000 cells/well and serum starved for 0-48 hours.          After media exchange,
compounds serially diluted in DMSO are added to the cells. After a brief incubation of ~30 min,
stimulants (TGFb, serum, LPA etc) are added followed by further incubation for 16-48 hours. Media
is then harvested and stored frozen in plate format for later endothelin-1 (ET-1) determination by
ELISA. Toxicity measurements are made using the ATPlite kit (Perkin-Elmer). ET-1 is quantified
using an ELISA kit (R&D Systems). The amount of ET-1 produced in the assay wells are back
calculated using the ELISA standard. The ability of a compound to inhibit ET-1 production is
typically analyzed by fitting dose-response curves to a 4-parameter logistic function to obtain an
EC50 value. A measure of cytotoxicity (CC50) is likewise reported from the same experiment using
the ATPlite data.

Assay of Inhibitorv Effect on Cell Proliferation(BrdUIncorporation)
        [1150]     Fibroblasts (primary human lung and dermal, HFL-1, 3T3 etc) were plated on a
96-well plate and serum starved for 24-48 hours.       The media were then exchanged for media
containing stimulants (LPA, TGFb, serum etc) and cultured further for 16-24 hours before BrdU
addition. After culturing for another 8 hours, cells were washed with PBS and the amount of BrdU
incorporated into the cells was assayed by absorbance at 450 nm using the Cell proliferation ELISA
                                                -296-

system (RPN250, Amersham LIFE SCIENCE).               The difference between the amount of BrdU
incorporated in the stimulant-added well and the amount of BrdU incorporated in the well containing
no stimulant represented the amount of BrdU incorporation accelerated by stimulant. The increase
of BrdU incorporation without the addition of test compounds was set as 100% and the
concentration of compound with 50% inhibition in the increase of BrdU incorporation (IC 50 value)
was determined. The test compounds were added 0-30 min before stimulant addition.
Assay Data for Compounds
        [1151]      Compounds of some embodiments were prepared according to synthetic methods
described herein and assay data obtained for IC 50 for BrdU inhibition. The assay data obtained is
presented in Table 3, in which A= less than 50 pM, B = greater than or equal to 50 pM and less than
or equal to 200 pM; and C = greater than 200 pM.

         [1152]     While the disclosure has been illustrated and described in detail in the
foregoing description, such illustration and description are to be considered illustrative or
exemplary and not restrictive. The disclosure is not limited to the disclosed embodiments.
Variations to the disclosed embodiments can be understood and effected by those skilled in
the art in practicing the claimed disclosure, from a study of the drawings, the disclosure and
the appended claims.
         [1153]     All references cited herein are incorporated herein by reference in their
entirety.   To the extent publications and patents or patent applications incorporated by
reference contradict the disclosure contained in the specification, the specification is intended
to supersede and/or take precedence over any such contradictory material.
         [1154]     Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific
terms) are to be given their ordinary and customary meaning to a person of ordinary skill in
the art, and are not to be limited to a special or customized meaning unless expressly so
defined herein. It should be noted that the use of particular terminology when describing
certain features or aspects of the disclosure should not be taken to imply that the terminology
is being re-defined herein to be restricted to include any specific characteristics of the
features or aspects of the disclosure with which that terminology is associated.
         [1155]     Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that the upper and
lower limit, and each intervening value between the upper and lower limit of the range is
encompassed within the embodiments.
         [1156]     Terms and phrases used in this application, and variations thereof,
especially in the appended claims, unless otherwise expressly stated, should be construed as
open ended as opposed to limiting. As examples of the foregoing, the term 'including'
should be read to mean 'including, without limitation,' 'including but not limited to,' or the
like; the term 'comprising' as used herein is synonymous with 'including,' 'containing,' or
'characterized by,' and is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited
elements or method steps; the term 'having' should be interpreted as 'having at least;' the
term 'includes' should be interpreted as 'includes but is not limited to;' the term 'example' is
used to provide exemplary instances of the item in discussion, not an exhaustive or limiting
list thereof; adjectives such as 'known', 'normal', 'standard', and terms of similar meaning
should not be construed as limiting the item described to a given time period or to an item
available as of a given time, but instead should be read to encompass known, normal, or
standard technologies that may be available or known now or at any time in the future; and
use of terms like 'preferably,' 'preferred,' 'desired,' or 'desirable,' and words of similar
                                              -299-

meaning should not be understood as implying that certain features are critical, essential, or
even important to the structure or function of the invention, but instead as merely intended to
highlight alternative or additional features that may or may not be utilized in a particular
embodiment of the invention. Likewise, a group of items linked with the conjunction 'and'
should not be read as requiring that each and every one of those items be present in the
grouping, but rather should be read as 'and/or' unless expressly stated otherwise. Similarly, a
group of items linked with the conjunction 'or' should not be read as requiring mutual
exclusivity among that group, but rather should be read as 'and/or' unless expressly stated
otherwise.
         [1157]      With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms
herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or from
the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application.      The various
singular/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.          The
indefinite article "a" or "an" does not exclude a plurality. A single processor or other unit
may fulfill the functions of several items recited in the claims. The mere fact that certain
measures are recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a
combination of these measures cannot be used to advantage.           Any reference signs in the
claims should not be construed as limiting the scope.
         [1158]      It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific
number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited
in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as
an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory
phrases "at least one" and "one or more" to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of
such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by
the indefinite articles "a" or "an" limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim
recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim
includes the introductory phrases "one or more" or "at least one" and indefinite articles such
as "a" or "an" (e.g., "a" and/or "an" should typically be interpreted to mean "at least one" or
"one or more"); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim
recitations.   In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is
explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically
be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of "two
recitations," without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more
recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of
                                               -300-

A, B, and C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the
art would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, and C" would include
but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together,
B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous
to "at least one of A, B, or C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one
having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, or
C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together,
A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by
those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative
terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the
possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase
"A or B" will be understood to include the possibilities of "A" or "B" or "A and B."
          111591 All numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used
in the specification are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term 'about.'
Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth herein are
approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained. At the very
least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of any
claims in any application claiming priority to the present application, each numerical parameter should
be construed in light of the number of significant digits and ordinary rounding approaches.
          111601 Furthermore, although the foregoing has been described in some detail by way of
illustrations and examples for purposes of clarity and understanding, it is apparent to those skilled in
the art that certain changes and modifications may be practiced. Therefore, the description and
examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention to the specific embodiments
and examples described herein, but rather to also cover all modification and alternatives coming with
the true scope and spirit of the invention.
          111611 Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the context requires
otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" and "comprising", will be
understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not the
exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps.
          111621 The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information derived
from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as an acknowledgment or
admission or any form of suggestion that that prior publication (or information derived from it) or
known matter forms part of the common general knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this
specification relates.
