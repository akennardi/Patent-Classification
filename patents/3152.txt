                                                   BACKGROUND
[0002]                 Extraction cleaners are well-known surface cleaning apparatuses for deep cleaning
carpets and other fabric surfaces, such as upholstery. Most extraction cleaners or extractors
comprise a fluid delivery system that delivers cleaning fluid to a surface to be cleaned and a
fluid recovery system that extracts spent cleaning fluid and debris (which may include dirt,
dust, stains, soil, hair, and other debris) from the surface. The fluid recovery system usually
comprises a recovery tank, a nozzle adjacent the surface to be cleaned and in fluid
communication with the recovery tank through a working air conduit, and a source of suction
in fluid communication with the working air conduit to draw the cleaning fluid from the
surface to be cleaned and through the nozzle and the working air conduit to the recovery tank.
The recovery tank is often removably mounted on the extraction cleaner in order to remove
the recovery tank for emptying.
                                                  BRIEF SUMMARY
[00031                According to one aspect of the invention, an extraction cleaner is provided with a
removable recovery tank. The recovery tank can include a recovery container defining a
recovery chamber and comprising a drain opening provided on a lower portion of the
recovery container, a valve fluidly connected to the drain opening for movement between a
closed position for sealing the recovery chamber and an open position for draining fluid from
the recovery chamber, and an actuator for selectively opening the valve, wherein at least a
portion of the actuator is provided on an upper portion of the recovery container.

                                 DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
[0020]                 The present invention relates to extraction cleaners. In one of its aspects, the
invention relates to an extraction cleaner with a removable recovery tank and an improved
arrangement for emptying the recovery tank.
[0021]                 FIG. 1 is a schematic view of various functional systems of a surface cleaning
apparatus in the form of an extraction cleaner 10. The functional systems of the extraction
cleaner 10 can be arranged into any desired configuration, such as an upright extraction
device having a base and an upright body for directing the base across the surface to be
cleaned, a canister device having a cleaning implement connected to a wheeled base by a
vacuum hose, a portable extractor adapted to be hand carried by a user for cleaning relatively
small areas, an autonomous extraction cleaner, or a commercial extractor. Any of the
aforementioned extraction cleaners can be adapted to include a flexible vacuum hose, which
can form a portion of the working air conduit between a nozzle and the suction source.
[0022] The extraction cleaner 10 can include a fluid delivery system 12 for storing cleaning
fluid and delivering the cleaning fluid to the surface to be cleaned and a recovery system 14
for removing the spent cleaning fluid and debris from the surface to be cleaned and storing the
spent cleaning fluid and debris.
[0023]                 The recovery system 14 can include a suction nozzle 16, a suction source 18 in
fluid communication with the suction nozzle 16 for generating a working airstream, and a
recovery tank 20 for separating and collecting fluid and debris from the working airstream for
later disposal. A separator 21 can be formed in a portion of the recovery tank 20 for
separating fluid and entrained debris from the working airstream.
[0024] The suction source 18, such as a motor/fan assembly, is provided in fluid
communication with the recovery tank 20. The motor/fan assembly 18 can be electrically
coupled to a power source 22, such as a battery or by a power cord plugged into a household
9775122_1 (GHMatters) P107774.AU

                                                        -4
electrical outlet. A suction power switch 24 between the motor/fan assembly 18 and the
power source 22 can be selectively closed by the user, thereby activating the motor/fan
assembly 18.
[0025]                 The suction nozzle 16 can be provided on a base or cleaning head adapted to
move over the surface to be cleaned. An agitator 26 can be provided adjacent to the suction
nozzle 16 for agitating the surface to be cleaned so that the debris is more easily ingested into
the suction nozzle 16. Some examples of agitators include, but are not limited to, a
horizontally-rotating brushroll, dual horizontally-rotating brushrolls, one or more vertically
rotating brushrolls, or a stationary brush.
[0026] The extraction cleaner 10 can also be provided with above-the-floor cleaning features.
A vacuum hose 28 can be selectively fluidly coupled to the motor/fan assembly 18 for above
the-floor cleaning using an above-the floor cleaning tool 30 with its own suction inlet. A
diverter assembly 32 can be selectively switched between on-the-floor and above-the floor
cleaning by diverting fluid communication between either the suction nozzle 16 or the
vacuum hose 28 with the motor/fan assembly 18.
[00271                 The fluid delivery system 12 can include at least one fluid container 34 for storing
a supply of fluid. The fluid can comprise one or more of any suitable cleaning fluids,
including, but not limited to, water, compositions, concentrated detergent, diluted detergent,
etc., and mixtures thereof. For example, the fluid can comprise a mixture of water and
concentrated detergent.
[0028] The fluid delivery system 12 can further comprise a flow control system 36 for
controlling the flow of fluid from the container 34 to at least one fluid distributor 38. In one
configuration, the flow control system 36 can comprise a pump 40 which pressurizes the
system 12 and a flow control valve 42 which controls the delivery of fluid to the distributor
38. An actuator 44 can be provided to actuate the flow control system 36 and dispense fluid
to the distributor 38. The actuator 44 can be operably coupled to the valve 42 such that
pressing the actuator 44 will open the valve 42. The valve 42 can be electrically actuated,
such as by providing an electrical switch 46 between the valve 42 and the power source 22
that is selectively closed when the actuator 44 is pressed, thereby powering the valve 42 to
move to an open position. In one example, the valve 42 can be a solenoid valve. The pump
9775122_1 (GHMatters) P107774.AU

                                                         -5
40 can also be coupled with the power source 22. In one example, the pump 40 can be a
centrifugal pump. In another example, the pump 40 can be a solenoid pump.
[0029]                 The fluid distributor 38 can include at least one distributor outlet 48 for delivering
fluid to the surface to be cleaned. The at least one distributor outlet 48 can be positioned to
deliver fluid directly to the surface to be cleaned, or indirectly by delivering fluid onto the
agitator 26. The at least one distributor outlet 48 can comprise any structure, such as a nozzle
or spray tip; multiple outlets 48 can also be provided. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the distributor
38 can comprise multiple sprayers 48 which distribute cleaning fluid to the surface to be
cleaned. For above-the-floor cleaning, the cleaning tool 30 can include an auxiliary
distributor (not shown) coupled with the fluid delivery system 12.
[0030]                 Optionally, a heater 50 can be provided for heating the cleaning fluid prior to
delivering the cleaning fluid to the surface to be cleaned. In the example illustrated in FIG. 1,
an in-line heater 50 can be located downstream of the container 34 and upstream of the pump
40. Other types of heaters 50 can also be used. In yet another example, the cleaning fluid can
be heated using exhaust air from a motor-cooling pathway for the motor/fan assembly 18.
[0031]                As another option, the fluid delivery system can be provided with an additional
container 52 for storing a cleaning fluid. For example, the first container 34 can store water
and the second container 52 can store a cleaning agent such as detergent. The containers 34,
52 can, for example, be defined by a supply tank and/or a collapsible bladder. In one
configuration, the first container 34 can be a bladder that is provided within the recovery tank
20. Alternatively, a single container can define multiple chambers for different fluids.
[0032] In the case where multiple containers 34, 52 are provided, the flow control system 36
can further be provided with a mixing system 54 for controlling the composition of the
cleaning fluid that is delivered to the surface. The composition of the cleaning fluid can be
determined by the ratio of cleaning fluids mixed together by the mixing system. As shown
herein, the mixing system 54 includes a mixing manifold 56 that selectively receives fluid
from one or both of the containers 34, 52. A mixing valve 58 is fluidly coupled with an outlet
of the second container 52, whereby when mixing valve 58 is open, the second cleaning fluid
will flow to the mixing manifold 56. By controlling the orifice of the mixing valve 58 or the
9775122_1 (GHMatters) P107774.AU

                                                          -6
time that the mixing valve 58 is open, the composition of the cleaning fluid that is delivered to
the surface can be selected.
[00331                 In yet another configuration of the fluid delivery system 12, the pump 40 can be
eliminated and the flow control system 38 can comprise a gravity-feed system having a valve
fluidly coupled with an outlet of the container(s) 34, 52, whereby when valve is open, fluid
will flow under the force of gravity to the distributor 38. The valve can be mechanically
actuated or electrically actuated, as described above.
[0034]                 The extraction cleaner 10 shown in FIG. 1 can be used to effectively remove
debris and fluid from the surface to be cleaned in accordance with the following method. The
sequence of steps discussed is for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to limit the
method in any way as it is understood that the steps may proceed in a different logical order,
additional or intervening steps may be included, or described steps may be divided into
multiple steps, without detracting from the invention.
[00351                 In operation, the extraction cleaner 10 is prepared for use by coupling the
extraction cleaner 10 to the power source 22, and by filling the first container 34, and
optionally the second container 52, with cleaning fluid. Cleaning fluid is selectively delivered
to the surface to be cleaned via the fluid delivery system 12 by user-activation of the actuator
44, while the extraction cleaner 10 is moved back and forth over the surface. The agitator 26
can simultaneously agitate the cleaning fluid into the surface to be cleaned. During operation
of the recovery system 14, the extraction cleaner 10 draws in fluid and debris-laden working
air through the suction nozzle 16 or cleaning tool 30, depending on the position of the diverter
assembly 32, and into the downstream recovery tank 20 where the fluid debris is substantially
separated from the working air. The airstream then passes through the motor/fan assembly 18
prior to being exhausted from the extraction cleaner 10. The recovery tank 20 can be
periodically emptied of collected fluid and debris.
[00361                 FIG. 2 is a perspective view illustrating one non-limiting example of an extraction
cleaner 10, according to a first embodiment of the invention. As illustrated herein, the
extraction cleaner 10 is an upright extraction cleaner having a housing that includes an upright
assembly 60 that is pivotally connected to a base assembly 62 for directing the base assembly
62 across the surface to be cleaned. The extraction cleaner 10 can comprise the various
9775122_1 (GHMatters) P107774.AU

                                                         -7
systems and components schematically described for FIG. 1, including the fluid delivery
system 12 for storing and delivering a cleaning fluid to the surface to be cleaned and the
recovery system 14 for extracting and storing the dispensed cleaning fluid, dirt and debris
from the surface to be cleaned. The various systems and components schematically described
for FIG. 1, including the fluid delivery system 12 and fluid recovery system 14 can be
supported by either or both the base assembly 62 and the upright assembly 60.
[00371                 For purposes of description related to the figures, the terms "upper," "lower,"
"right," "left," "rear," "front," "vertical," "horizontal,"' inner,"' outer," and derivatives
thereof shall relate to the invention as oriented in FIG. 2 from the perspective of a user behind
the extraction cleaner 10, which defines the rear of the extraction cleaner 10. However, it is
to be understood that the invention may assume various alternative orientations, except where
expressly specified to the contrary.
[00381                 The upright assembly 60 includes a main support section or frame 64 supporting
components of the fluid delivery system 12 and the recovery system 14, including, but not
limited to, the recovery tank 20 and the fluid container 34. The upright assembly 60 also has
an elongated handle 66 extending upwardly from the frame 64 that is provided with a hand
grip 68 at one end that can be used for maneuvering the extraction cleaner 10 over a surface to
be cleaned. The frame 64 of the upright assembly 60 can include container receivers for
respectively receiving the recovery and fluid containers 20, 34 for support on the upright
assembly 60; additional details of suitable container receivers are disclosed in U.S. Patent
Application Publication No. 2017/0071434, filed September 13, 2016 and published March
16, 2017, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A motor housing 70 is
formed at a lower end of the frame 64 and contains the motor/fan assembly 18 (FIG. 1)
positioned therein in fluid communication with the recovery tank 20. Additional details of a
suitable base assembly 62 for the extraction cleaner 10 is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application
Publication No. 2017/0071434, incorporated above.
[0039]                 FIG. 3 is a perspective view of a recovery tank 20 for an extraction cleaner
according to a first embodiment of the invention and FIG. 4 is a partially exploded, side view
of the recovery tank 20. The recovery tank 20 may be used on the extraction cleaner 10
shown in FIG. 1 or FIG. 2. The recovery tank 20 can include a recovery container 72 defining
a recovery chamber 74 and an air/liquid separator 76 within the recovery chamber 74. At

least a portion of the container 72 can be formed of a transparent or tinted translucent
material, which permits a user to view the contents of the recovery tank 20. A badge 78 can
be provided on a front lower portion of the container 72. A handle 80 can be provided on the
container 72, which facilitates removing and carrying the container 72. The handle 80 can be
pivotally coupled to the container 72 and can be provided near the top of the container 72,
although other locations are possible.
[0040]                 The recovery container 72 can generally have a bottom end and a top end opposite
the bottom end. Particularly as shown herein, the recovery container 72 can include a bottom
wall 90 and a top wall 92, with a peripheral side wall 82 extending between the bottom wall
90 and the top wall 92. The air/liquid separator 76 can be located within the tank container
64, with the space between the separator 76 and the side and bottom walls 82, 90 forming the
recovery chamber 74 for holding recovered debris and fluid. The carry handle 80 is provided
at the top wall 92 of the container, and can be pivotally mounted to the side walls 82. In an
alternate embodiment, not shown, the top wall 92 of the container 72 may form or be defined
by a removable tank lid for the recovery tank 20, with the tank lid 92 carrying the handle 80.
[0041]                 The container 72 can be provided with a drain opening 88 for emptying the
container 72. A valve is fluidly connected to the drain opening 88 for movement between a
closed position for sealing the recovery chamber 74 and an open position for draining fluid
from the recovery chamber 74 through the drain opening 88. An actuator, at least a portion of
which may be manually-engagable by a user, is provided for selectively opening the valve. In
one embodiment, at least a portion of the actuator may conveniently be provided on an upper
portion of the container 72. As such, the valve may be remotely-actuated.
[0042]                 The drain opening 88 in the illustrated embodiment is provided on a lower portion
and/or at the bottom end of the container 72 and is selectively closed by a valve in the form of
a bottom empty door 84 that is hingedly connected to the bottom of the container 72 for
movement between a closed position shown in FIG. 3 in which the door 84 covers the drain
opening 88 and an open position shown in FIG. 4 in which the door 84 is spaced from the
drain opening 88 such that any contents of the container 72 are free to flow out of the
chamber 74 through the drain opening 88. The door 84 includes a drain plug 86 for sealing
the drain opening 88 for emptying the container, which is shown in the embodiment herein as
a drain hole in the bottom wall 90 of the container.

                                                          -9
[00431                 The drain plug 86 is aligned with the drain opening 88 to seal the drain opening
88 when the door 84 is closed for a fluid-tight closure, such that the container 72 is leak-free.
The drain plug 86 can be at least partially received in the drain opening 88 to stop up or fill
the drain opening 88. Other sealing arrangements are possible, including seals which are not
received within the drain opening 88 itself, but which provide a fluid-tight and leak proof
engagement between the drain opening 88 and the door 84.
[0044]                 The actuator for the valve of the illustrated embodiment includes at least a user
engagable button 94 and an elongate push rod 96 configured to selectively open the bottom
empty door 84. The button 94 is operably connected to the push rod 96, and can be provided
at an upper portion of the container 72, such as on the top wall 92 of the container 72. In one
example, the button 94 can be connected to the push rod by a fastener (not shown), such as a
mechanical fastener, a screw, a detent, or bayonet style hook, for example. The button 94 and
push rod 96 can be biased upwardly by a spring (not shown).                The elongate push rod 96 can
be configured to selectively release a door latch 98 to open the bottom empty door 84 and
separate the drain plug 86 from the drain opening 88. The door latch 98 can be any suitable
device for holding the door 84 closed, and which may be released by the push rod 96.
[0045]                 In one example illustrated in FIGS 1OA - 1OC, the door latch 98 can comprise a
hook 250 for selectively engaging a catch 252 defined by a recess on the lower portion of the
container 72. The door latch 98 is mounted to a forward portion of the bottom empty door 84
about a pivot 254, such that the hook 250 can be pivoted into our out of engagement with the
catch 252. The latch 98 can be biased towards the locked position, i.e. with the hook 250
received by the catch 252, by a torsion spring (not shown). The hook 250 further comprises a
wedge-shaped cam surface 256 in operable engagement with a ramp 258 on a lower portion of
the push rod 96. In operation, as the button 94 and push rod 96 are pressed downwardly, the
cam surface 256 is configured to ride along the ramp 258, which forces the hook 250 to rotate
outwardly and downwardly about the pivot 254, thereby disengaging the catch 252. The push
rod 96 can continue to push the latch 98 downwardly, which releases the empty door 84 and
separates the drain plug 86 from the drain opening 88 for emptying contents of the container
72.
[00461                 The elongate push rod 96 can be provided on an exterior of the recovery tank 20;
for example, the push rod 96 can be provided for sliding movement along the outside surface

of the peripheral side wall 82. Pressing the button 94 translates the push rod 96 downwardly
along the side wall 84 to push open the door 84.
[00471                 FIG. 5 is a partially exploded, side view of the recovery tank 20 of FIG. 3. The
container 72 has an insertion opening 102 through which the air/liquid separator 76 is inserted
into and removed from the recovery chamber 74. The insertion opening 102 can be provided
on the bottom wall 90 of the container 72, such that the air/liquid separator 76 is inserted
through the opening 102 and extends upwardly from the bottom wall 92. The insertion
opening 102 can be separate from the drain opening 88 for emptying the container 72 that is
closed by the door 84, so that the air/liquid separator 76 does not have to be removed every
time the container 72 is emptied. In the illustrated embodiment the door 84 does not cover the
insertion opening 102 so that the air/liquid separator 76 is removable from the container 72
without needing to open the door 84. Optionally as shown herein, the bottom wall 90 includes
at least two surfaces provided on different planes and which may be angled relative to each
other, with the drain opening 88 formed in one surface of the bottom wall 90 and the insertion
opening 102 formed in another surface of the button wall 90.
[0048]                 The air/liquid separator 76 is configured to be easily removable from the recovery
container 72 by a user. This permits the air/liquid separator 76 to be disassembled and
cleaned more thoroughly as needed. A coupling between the recovery container 72 and the
air/liquid separator 76 can be provided for facilitating easy separation of the two components.
As shown herein, the coupling comprises a threaded collar 106 which screws onto a threaded
neck 180 on the bottom wall of the container 72 which defines the opening 102 through which
the air/liquid separator 76 is inserted. A flange 110 on the bottom of the air/liquid separator
76 limits insertion of the separator 76 into the container 72. A seal 112 provides a fluid-tight
interface between the container 72 and the and the air/liquid separator 76 when the air/liquid
separator 76 is mounted within the recovery chamber 74, and also prevents the container 72
from leaking when removed from the upright assembly 60 (FIG. 2). Other couplings between
the recovery container 72 and the air/liquid separator 76 can be provided, such as a bayonet
type coupling.
[0049]                 The air/liquid separator 76 includes a stack 114 for guiding air and liquid through
the container 72 and a float assembly 116 for selectively closing the suction path through the
container 72. The stack 114 includes an inlet column 118 which receives recovered air and
9775122_1 (GHMatters) P107774.AU

liquid form the suction nozzle 16 (FIG. 1), and opens into the interior of the container 72, and
an outlet column 120 which passes substantially clean air, and substantially no liquid, to the
motor/fan assembly 18 (FIG. 1) and includes an air inlet port 122 at an upper end of the
column 120.
[0050] The float assembly 116 includes float shutter 124 and a float body 126 coupled with
the float shutter 124 for selectively raising the float shutter 124 to a closed position in which
the float shutter 124 closes the air inlet port 122 of the outlet column 120. The float shutter
124 slides within a guide passage provided on the stack 114 defined by opposing guide
projections 130 which receive the float body 126, with the float body 126 at least partially
wrapping around the columns 118, 120. The float body 126 is buoyant, and as the liquid level
container rises, the float body 126 raises the float shutter 124 to close the air inlet port 122
and prevent liquid from exiting the container 72 and entering the motor/fan assembly 18 (FIG.
1).
[0051]                 FIG. 6 is a rear perspective view of the air/liquid separator 76. The inlet column
118 includes an open upper end defining an air/liquid outlet port 132 that opens into the
interior or recovery chamber 74 of the container 72. A separator shield 134 extends at least
partially over or around the outlet port 132 to separate incoming air and liquid. The shield
134 may include a central portion 136 which curves outwardly and over the outlet port 132
and lateral side portions 138 which curve around the sides of the outlet port 132. At least one
baffle 140 can also be provided to prevent the full volume of extracted liquid entering the
container 72 from hitting the top of the shield 134 at high speed, thereby reducing the amount
of foam and splashing inside the container 72. As illustrated, the at least one baffle 140 can
include multiple ribs on the inner surface of the shield 134 and which project at least partially
over the outlet port 132 to interrupt the liquid flow path and slow down the liquid. The ribs
140 can extend between the side portions 138 of the shield 134, partially or completely across
the central portion 136.
[0052] FIGS. 7A-7B are cross-section views of the recovery tank 20. FIG. 7A shows the
flow of air and liquid through the recovery tank 20 with arrows. Debris-containing fluid,
which can contain air and liquid, is drawn into the container 72, via the inlet column 118 of
the separator 76. The debris-containing fluid strikes the separator shield 134, but is first
slowed by the ribs 140. Liquid and debris in the fluid then fall under the force of gravity to

the bottom of the container 72. The air drawn into the container 72, now separated from
liquid and debris, is drawn into the outlet column 120. As the level of liquid in the container
72 rises, the float assembly 116 will move from an open position, one example of which is
shown in FIG. 7A, to a closed position, one example of which is shown in FIG. 7B.
[0053]                 FIGS. 8-9 are side views of the recovery tank 20 of FIG. 3, illustrating the
emptying operation of the tank 20. When a user desires to empty the recovery tank 20 of its
contents, the user separates the tank 20 from the extraction cleaner 10, carries the tank 20 by
its handle 80 to a suitable waste receptacle, such as a sink or toilet, and empties the tank 20 by
pushing the button 94 while conveniently maintaining the tank 20 in the same, upright
position in which it is carried, as shown in FIG. 8. Pushing the button 94 releases the door
latch 98 to open the bottom empty door 84 and separate the drain plug 86 from the drain
opening 88, as shown in FIGS. 4 and 9.
[0054]                 It is noted that while the embodiment shown in FIGS. 3-9 has the door release
mechanism on the outside of the tank 20, at least a portion of the door release mechanism can
alternatively be routed inside the tank 20. For example, the push rod 96 and/or the door latch
98 can be provided within the container 72.
[0055]                 FIG. 11 is a perspective view of a recovery tank 20' for an extraction cleaner
according to a second embodiment of the invention. The recovery tank 20' may be used on
the extraction cleaner 10 shown in FIG. 1 or FIG. 2. In the second embodiment, the drain
opening 88' is provided on a lower portion and/or at the bottom end of the container 72' and
is selectively closed by the drain plug 86', which is connected directly to the push rod 96',
rather than being indirectly connected via the door 84 of the first embodiment. In one
embodiment, the drain plug 86' can be connected to the push rod 96' by a fastener (not
shown), such as a screw.
[00561                 The drain plug 86' is aligned with the drain opening 88' to seal the drain opening
88' when the push rod 96'is translated upwardly for a fluid-tight closure, such that the
container 72' is leak-free. The drain plug 86' can be at least partially received in the drain
opening 88' to stop up or fill the drain opening 88'. Other sealing arrangements are possible,
including seals which are not received within the drain opening 88' itself, but which provide a

fluid-tight and leak proof engagement between the drain opening 88' and a portion of the push
rod 96'.
[00571                Also, the push rod 96' can be routed inside the tank 20', which facilitates direct
connection to the drain plug 86'. The push rod 96' can be provided within the recovery tank
20; for example, the push rod 96 can be provided for sliding movement within the chamber
74'. The button 94' can be connected to the push rod 96 via a pivot arm (not shown) such
that pressing the button 94' downwardly translates the push rod 96' upwardly via the pivot
arm (not shown) to pull the drain plug 86' away from the drain opening 88'.
[00581                Also in the second embodiment, the tank empty button 94' can also be positioned
on or adjacent to a portion of the carry handle 80' so that a user can conveniently operate the
button 94' when holding the tank 20' by the carry handle 80'.
[0059]                 Yet another difference between the first and second embodiments is that in the
second embodiment, the carry handle 80' is not pivotable or rotatable relative to the container
72'. The carry handle 80' is fixed on the top wall 92; and oriented so that the user can grip
the carry handle 80' with one hand and operate the button 94' with the thumb of the same
hand. Preferably, the button 94' is provided on the end of the carry handle 80' that is
rearward when the recovery tank 20' is mounted on the extraction cleaner 10, such that the
user can grip the carry handle 80' to remove the tank 20' and open the drain opening 88'
without changing grip position.
[00601                 When the tank empty button 94' is depressed, the push rod 96' pulls the drain
plug 86' away from the drain opening 88' and recovered liquid flows out of the tank 20'. The
drain plug 86', push rod 96' and button 94'assembly can be normally biased to the sealed
position, so the drain plug 86' seals the drain opening 88'. In one example, a coil spring (not
shown) beneath the button 94' can force the button 94' upwardly, which forces the push rod
96' downwardly via the pivot arm (not shown) to the sealed position with the drain plug 86'
sealing the drain opening 88'.
[00611                 FIG. 12 is a side view of the recovery tank 20' of FIG. 11, the emptying operation
of the tank 20'. When a user desires to empty the recovery tank 20' of its contents, the user
separates the tank 20' from the extraction cleaner 10, carries the tank 20' by its handle 80' to
a suitable waste receptacle, such as a sink or toilet, and empties the tank 20' by pushing the

button 94' while conveniently maintaining the tank 20' in the same, upright position in which
it is carried, as shown in FIG. 12. Pushing the button 94' pulls the drain plug 86' away from
the drain opening 88', and recovered liquid can flow out of the tank 20'.
[0062]                 There are several advantages of the present disclosure arising from the various
features of the apparatuses described herein. For example, the embodiments of the invention
described above allow for quick and ergonomic emptying of a recovery tank for an extraction
cleaner. The prior art includes tanks with removable lids or top-emptying features that require
the user to tilt or rotate the tank to empty its contents. These actions typically require the use
of two hands. The recovery tank 20 shown in the embodiments herein offers a more
ergonomic push button solution that does not require the tank to be tilted or rotated to empty
it. Instead, the tank remains in the upright position and the user can quickly empty the
recovered liquid using a single hand with just the push of a button.
[0063]                 While various embodiments illustrated herein show an upright extraction cleaner,
for example FIG. 2, aspects of the invention may be used on other types of extraction
cleaners, including, but not limited to, a canister device having a cleaning implement
connected to a wheeled base by a vacuum hose, a portable extractor adapted to be hand
carried by a user for cleaning relatively small areas, an autonomous extraction cleaner, or a
commercial extractor. For example, any of the embodiments can be combined with an
extraction cleaner as generally outlined with respect to FIG. 1. Still further, aspects of the
invention may also be used on surface cleaning apparatus other than extraction cleaners, such
as a steam cleaner or a vacuum cleaner. A steam cleaner generates steam by heating water to
boiling for delivery to the surface to be cleaned, either directly or via cleaning pad. Some
steam cleaners collect liquid in the pad, or may extract liquid using suction force. A vacuum
cleaner typically does not deliver or extract liquid, but rather is used for collecting relatively
dry debris (which may include dirt, dust, stains, soil, hair, and other debris) from a surface.
[0064]                 While the invention has been specifically described in connection with certain
specific embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that this is by way of illustration and not
of limitation. Reasonable variation and modification are possible with the scope of the
foregoing disclosure and drawings without departing from the spirit of the invention which, is
defined in the appended claims. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics
