         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         The present invention relates to a method for preparing a pharmaceutical
 5 intermediate which belongs to the field of organic synthesis, more particularly, relates
   to isopropyl myristate drug intermediates myristic acid synthesis method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         Myristic acid is mainly used as a raw material for the production of surfactants,and
10 for the production of sorbitan fatty acid esters, glycerol fatty acid esters, ethylene glycol
   or propylene glycol fatty acid esters. It can also be used for the production of isopropyl
   myristate and so on. it is also used for defoamers, flavoring agent, it can be used to
   prepare a variety of food spices. Isopropyl myristate is a non-fat emollient, it can be
   easily absorbed by the skin. It is one of the components of the semi-solid matrix and can
15 also be used as a solvent for many substances in the topical formulation. It is used in a
   variety of topical preparations and cosmetics, including bath oils, cosmetics, hair care
   armor products, creams, lotions, lip balm, shaving cream, emollients, deodorants, ear
   suspensions. For example, isopropyl myristate is a self-emulsifying ingredient in a cold
   cream prescription which can be used as a matrix for many drugs and skin medications;
20 in cosmetics, its stability in the mixture of water and glycerol is also used. Isopropyl
   myristate can be used as a penetration enhancer in transdermal absorption preparations
   and can be used in conjunction with the treatment of ultrasound and ion implantation.
   Myristic acid as a pharmaceutical intermediates of isopropyl myristate,          its synthesis
   method is of great significance. However, most of the existing synthetic methods are
25 using myristic acid aldehydes as the reactant, it is complicated and the final yield is not
   very high. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new synthetic method for further
   improving the quality and yield of the product and reducing the byproduct content.
