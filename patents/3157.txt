             EXTRUDED IMMEDIATE RELEASE ABUSE DETERRENT PILL
 Cross-Reference to Related Applications
 [0001]     This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 61/864,926,
 filed August 12, 2013, and 61/980,242, filed April 16, 2014, both of which are incorporated
herein by reference in their entirety.
Field of the Technology
 [0002]     The present disclosure relates to an oral immediate release, abuse deterrent pill
prepared using a hot melt extrusion process and a forming unit. The pill contains at least one
abuse deterrent mechanism to reduce abuse by non-oral administration routes, e.g. intranasal
and/or intravenous. The extrusion process and forming unit are designed to efficiently prepare
the abuse deterrent pill under conditions that reduce, or substantially eliminate, degradation of
the active substance.
Background
 [0003]     FDA-approved drugs are provided in many different forms based on the type of
active substance, the indication treated and the preferred route of administration. These forms
include enteral formulations (e.g., tablets, capsules or pills), parenteral formulations (e.g.,
injectable formulations such as intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular and intraarticular),
liquid formulations (e.g., elixirs), lyophilized formulations and topical formulations. A majority
of the FDA-approved drugs are currently available in enteral form, as either a tablet or capsule.
[0004]      The production of pharmaceutical drugs in pill form by hot melt extrusion is
relatively uncommon. While the idea of dissolving drugs in polymers and using extrusion to
produce a pill has been known for decades, only a handful of FDA-approved drugs are extruded.
Recently, extrusion techniques have been investigated for preparing abuse deterrent
formulations. For example, U.S. 8,075,872 (assigned to Grunenthal GmbH) is directed to a
thermoshaped abuse deterrent dosage form prepared with the assistance of an extruder. The
extrudate may be shaped by the assistance of contra-rotating calendar rolls, and singulated by
conventional means such as chopping. U.S. 8,383,152 (assigned to Grunenthal GmbH) is

      WO 2015/023675                                                          PCT/US2014/050737
                                                  2
 directed to a controlled release pharmaceutical dosage form that may also be prepared by
 extrusion and shaped by a calendaring process. U.S. 2007/0190142 (assigned to Abbott GmbH)
 is directed to a sustained release abuse deterrent dosage form prepared by extrusion and shaping
 the extrudate into a dosage form without a milling or multi-particulating step.
 Summary
 [0005]      The present disclosure relates to an abuse deterrent pill prepared using a hot melt
 extrusion process and a forming unit. The formulation contains an active substance susceptible
to abuse and at least one abuse deterrent mechanism to reduce abuse by non-oral administration
routes (e.g., intranasal and/or intravenous). The abuse deterrent pill is designed for immediate
release of the active substance upon oral administration. The method of preparing the pill
utilizes a hot melt extrusion process coupled with an in-line forming unit which eliminates the
need for traditional extrusion processing steps, such as chopping the extrudate and molding the
cut extrudate into a final form. The hot melt extrusion process and forming unit are operated
under conditions that reduce, or substantially eliminate degradation of the active substance.
 [0006]      In one embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a directly-formed oral, extruded,
immediate release, abuse deterrent pill comprising an active substance susceptible to abuse, a
matrix agent and a plasticizer, wherein the pill is directly formed from a hot melt extrusion
process, preferably without further processing (e.g., a cutting step). The extrudate may be re
sized or re-shaped, without cutting, prior to forming (e.g., rope sizer).
[0007]       In another embodiment, the present disclosure relates to an oral, immediate release,
abuse deterrent pill comprising an active substance susceptible to abuse, a matrix agent and a
plasticizer, wherein the active substance susceptible to abuse has an immediate release profile,
and wherein the composition includes a physical barrier to reduce abuse. In some embodiments,
the physical barrier can reduce abuse by techniques such as pulverizing and swallowing,
pulverizing and snorting, or pulverizing and injecting. In other embodiments, the physical
barrier can reduce abuse by forming a hydrogel upon exposure to an aqueous or semi-aqueous
solution. In some embodiments, the semi-aqueous solution is a 95% ethanol/5% water solution.

 [0008]       In another embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a process for the production
 of an oral, immediate release, abuse deterrent pill containing at least one active substance
 susceptible to abuse comprising processing a uniform blend of the at least one active substance
 susceptible to abuse, a matrix agent and a plasticizer by hot melt extrusion to form an extrudate.
The extrudate may therein be formed into the pill using a forming unit.
 [0009]       In another embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a process for the production
of an oral, immediate release, abuse deterrent pill containing at least one active substance
susceptible to abuse comprising one or more of the following steps: combining the at least one
active substance susceptible to abuse, a matrix agent and a plasticizer in a hopper to form a
mixture; blending the mixture in the hopper until a uniform blend is achieved; monitoring the
mixture during blending using a process analytical technique to determine when a uniform blend
is achieved; feeding the uniform blend into an extruder; processing the uniform blend by hot
melt extrusion to produce an extrudate; transferring the extrudate to a forming unit using a
transfer unit capable of controlling the temperature, pressure, environment and/or shape of the
extrudate; forming the extrudate using the forming unit into the pill; and determining the quality,
volume and weight of the pill using an optical inspection technique.
[0010]       In another embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a method of treating pain
comprising administering to an individual in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of
an abuse deterrent formulation prepared using a hot melt extrusion process and a forming unit as
described herein.
Brief Description of the Drawings

Detailed Description
[0021]       Abuse of prescription drugs, particularly opioids, is a serious and growing public
health concern. To address this concern, new formulations are being developed that contain
abuse-deterrent properties. Abuse deterrent properties include properties that make product
manipulation more difficult or make abuse of the manipulated product less attractive or
rewarding.

      WO 2015/023675                                                          PCT/US2014/050737
                                                  5
  [0022]     Recently the FDA issued a draft guidance for industry related to formulations having
 abuse deterrent properties. Guidancefor Industry: Abuse-Deterrent Opioids - Evaluationand
 Labeling, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, FDA, CDER, January 2013, the
 entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. These guidelines separate abuse
 deterrent formulations into six categories, including: physical/chemical barriers,
 agonist/antagonist combinations, aversion, delivery system, prodrug, or a combination of the
 aforementioned. As described by the FDA guidance, the categories are:
 [0023]      Physical/Chemical barriers - Physical barriers can prevent chewing, pulverizing,
 cutting, grating, or grinding. Chemical barriers can resist extraction of the opioid using common
 solvents like water, alcohol, or other organic solvents. Physical and chemical barriers can
 change the physical form of an oral drug rendering it less amenable to abuse.
 [0024]      Agonist/Antagonist combinations - An opioid antagonist can be added to interfere
 with, reduce, or defeat the euphoria associated with abuse. The antagonist can be sequestered
 and released only upon manipulation of the product. For example, a drug product may be
formulated such that the substance that acts as an antagonist is not clinically active when the
product is swallowed but becomes active if the product is crushed and injected or snorted.
 [0025]      Aversion - Substances can be combined to produce an unpleasant effect if the dosage
form is manipulated prior to ingestion or a higher dosage than directed is used.
 [0026]      Delivery System (including depot injectable formulations and implants) - Certain
drug release designs or the method of drug delivery can offer resistance to abuse. For example, a
sustained-release depot injectable formulation that is administered intramuscularly or a
subcutaneous implant can be more difficult to manipulate.
[0027]       Prodrug - A prodrug that lacks opioid activity until transformed in the gastrointestinal
tract can be unattractive for intravenous injection or intranasal routes of abuse.
[0028]       Combination - Two or more of the above methods can be combined to deter abuse.
[0029]       An opioid analgesic submitted for abuse deterrent formulation (ADF) labeling must
show conformance to one or more of these categories. The present disclosure relates to an abuse
deterrent pill for oral administration, which provides immediate release of an active
pharmaceutical substance and conforms to one or more of these categories. In one embodiment,

      WO 2015/023675                                                          PCT/US2014/050737
                                                   6
 the abuse deterrent formulation of the present disclosure conforms to at least one of the six FDA
 categories. In another embodiment, the abuse deterrent formulation of the present disclosure
 conforms to at least two of the six FDA categories. In another embodiment, the abuse deterrent
 formulation of the present disclosure conforms to at least three of the six FDA categories. In
 another embodiment, the abuse deterrent formulation of the present disclosure conforms to at
 least four of the six FDA categories. In another embodiment, the abuse deterrent formulation of
the present disclosure conforms to at least five of the six FDA categories.
 [0030]      For example, an abuse deterrent pill of the present disclosure can reduce abuse by the
 incorporation of at least one physical barrier. The physical barrier is designed to prevent abuse
based on chewing, pulverizing, cutting, grating or grinding. Preferably, the physical barrier
prevents or reduces the effectiveness of these methods. As used herein, the phrase "abuse
deterrent" means that the active substance cannot readily be separated from the formulation in a
form suitable for abuse by such means as, for example, grinding. The abuse deterrent pill of the
present disclosure cannot be easily ground, extracted from, or both. Abuse deterrent measures
render it difficult to transform the pill into a powder or extract for non-oral administration, such
as intranasal or intravenous.
 [0031]      In one embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a directly-formed, extruded, oral,
immediate release, abuse deterrent pill. The pill includes an active substance susceptible to
abuse, a matrix agent and a plasticizer. After extrusion, the extrudate is directly formed into the
pill without further processing, such as the use of a cutting step.
[0032]       As used herein, the term "active substance" or "active substance susceptible to abuse"
means an opioid or opioid related compound subject to potential abuse. The active substance
may include, without limitation, alfentanil, allylprodine, alphaprodine, amphetamine,
anileridine, benzylmorphine, bezitramide, buprenorphine, butorphanol, clonitazene, codeine,
cyclazocine, desomorphine, dextroamphetamine, dextromoramide, dezocine, diampromide,
dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, dimenoxadol, dimepheptanol, dimethylthiambutene,
dioxaphetyl butyrate, dipipanone, eptazocine, ethoheptazine, ethylmethylthiambutene,
ethylmorphine, etonitazene, fentanyl, heroin, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, hydroxypethidine,
isomethadone, ketobemidone, levallorphan, levophenacylmorphan, levorphanol, lofentanil,
meperidine, meptazinol, metazocine, methadone, metopon, morphine, myrophine, nalbulphine,

narceine, nicomorphine, norpipanone, opium, oxycodone, papvretum, pentazocine,
phenadoxone, phenazocine, phenomorphan, phenoperidine, piminodine, propiram,
propoxyphene, sufentanil, tilidine, and tramadol, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and
mixtures thereof. Preferably, the active substance is either oxycodone or hydrocodone. In one
embodiment, the formulation of the present disclosure excludes oxymorphone. For example, the
formulation of the present disclosure contains at least one active substance susceptible to abuse,
provided the active substance is not oxymorphone.
[0033]       The amount of active substance in the formulation may vary depending on the active
substance, stability, release profile and bioavailability. The amount of active substance in the
formulation may range from about 0.50 Wt% to about 15 Wt%. Particularly, the amount of
active substance in the formulation may range from about 0.75 Wt% to about 14 Wt%, or from
about 1.0 Wt% to about 13 Wt%, or from about 2.0 Wt% to about 12 Wt%, or from about 3.0
Wt% to about 11 Wt%, or from about 5.0 Wt% to about 10 Wt%. For example, the formulation
may be a 100 mg pill having about 5 mg or about 10 mg of active substance (e.g., oxycodone
HCl or hydrocodone bitartrate).
[0034]       In another embodiment, the amount of active substance in the formulation may range
from about 0.50 Wt% to about 40 Wt%. Particularly, the amount of active substance in the
formulation may range from about 0.75 Wt% to about 37.5 Wt%, or from about 1.0 Wt% to
about 35 Wt%, or from about 2.0 Wt% to about 34 Wt%, or from about 3.0 Wt% to about 32.5
Wt%, or from about 5.0 Wt% to about 30 Wt%. For example, the formulation may be a 100 mg
pill having about 5 mg or about 30 mg of active substance (e.g., oxycodone HCI or hydrocodone
bitartrate).
[0035]       Formulations of the present disclosure may also include an additional active
ingredient. Additional active ingredients include other analgesics, such as acetaminophen,
ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid and/or naproxen. For example, the formulation may include an
oxycodone HCl/acetaminophen combination, or a hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen
combination.
[0036]       In one embodiment, the formulation includes at least one active substance, e.g.
hydrocodone bitartrate, and at least one additional ingredient, e.g. acetaminophen. The amount
of the at least one active substance and the additional ingredient in the formulation may vary

     WO 2015/023675                                                           PCT/US2014/050737
                                                  8
depending on the active substance or the additional ingredient, their stability, their release profile
and their bioavailability. In addition to the ranges provided above for the amount of active
substance in the formulation, the amount of active substance in the formulation may also range
from about 0.10 Wt% to about 10.0 Wt%. Particularly, the amount of active substance in the
formulation may range from about 0.20 Wt% to about 8.0 Wt%, or from about 0.3 Wt% to about
6.0 Wt%, or from about 0.4 Wt% to about 4.0 Wt%, or from about 0.5 Wt% to about 2.0 Wt%.
The amount of additional ingredient in the formulation may range from about 15 Wt% to about
80 Wt%. Particularly, the amount of additional substance in the formulation may range from
about 20 Wt% to about 75 Wt%, or from about 25 Wt% to about 70 Wt%, or from about 30 Wt%
to about 65 Wt%. For example, the formulation may be a 500 mg or 1,000 mg pill having about
5 mg or about 10 mg of active substance (e.g., oxycodone HCl or hydrocodone bitartrate) and
about 300 mg or about 325 mg of additional analgesic (e.g. acetaminophen).
[0037]      The dosage form of the present disclosure can be rendered abuse deterrent by
incorporating at least one matrix agent in the formulation to increase the strength of the tablet
beyond that of conventional dosage forms. The matrix agent increases the dosage form's
resistance to physical or mechanical forces, such as pulverizing or grinding. By selecting the
appropriate molecular weight grade and the quantity present within a formulation, the strength
characteristics of the dosage form can be manipulated in a way to create a wide array of abuse
deterrent pills have immediate release profiles.
[0038]      The matrix agent may also render the dosage form abuse deterrent by acting as a
gelling or viscosity increasing agent. Upon contact with a solvent (e.g., aqueous or semi
aqueous solution), the dosage form is capable of absorbing the solvent and swelling to form a
viscous or semi-viscous substance. The formation of a viscous or semi-viscous substance
significantly reduces and/or minimizes the amount of free solvent which can contain an amount
of active substance, and which can be drawn into a syringe. The matrix agent can also reduce the
overall amount of active substance extractable with the solvent by entrapping the active
substance in a gel matrix. Typical matrix agents include pharmaceutically acceptable polymers,
typically hydrophilic polymers, such as those that form hydrogels. These properties allow for an
oral drug delivery system that satisfies at least one of the categories in the FDA guidance (e.g.,
"physical and chemical barriers can change the physical form of an oral drug rendering it less
amenable to abuse").

     WO 2015/023675                                                         PCT/US2014/050737
                                                 9
[0039]       The matrix agent may exhibit a high degree of viscosity upon contact with a suitable
solvent. The high viscosity can enhance the formation of highly viscous gels when attempts are
made to crush and dissolve the contents of a formulation in an aqueous or semi-aqueous vehicle
and inject it intravenously. For example, when an abuser crushes and dissolves the formulation
in a solvent, a viscous or semi-viscous gel is formed. The increase in the viscosity of the
solution discourages the abuser from injecting the gel intravenously or intramuscularly by
preventing the abuser from transferring sufficient amounts of the solution to a syringe.
[0040]       Suitable matrix agents are natural or synthetic polymers capable of providing
increased resistance to pulverizing or grinding. The matrix agent may be selected from the group
consisting of agar, alamic acid, alginic acid, carmellose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium,
chitosan, copovidone, dextrin, gelatin, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose,
hypromellose (HPMC), methylcellulose derivatives, microcrystalline cellulose, polyacrylic acid,
polyalkalene oxide (e.g., polymethylene oxide, polyethylene oxide and polypropylene oxide),
polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, povidone, propylene glycol alginate, polyvinylcaprolactam
- polyvinyl acetate - polyethylene glycol graft co-polymer, pullulan, silicon dioxide, sodium
alginate, starch, and vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymers. In one embodiment, the matrix
agent is a polyethylene oxide. Polyethylene oxide is a non-ionic, water soluble polymer that is
readily available in a wide range of molecular weight grades.
[0041]      The matrix agent should be capable of both ensuring the formation of a solid dosage
form by extrusion and allowing immediate release of the active substance. The formulation of
the present disclosure may accomplish both capabilities by using a matrix agent having an
appropriate molecular weight (or appropriate average molecular weight), such as between about
50K Daltons and about 300K Daltons.
[0042]      In one embodiment, the matrix agent has a molecular weight between about 100K and
about 300K Daltons. Particularly, the matrix agent has a molecular weight between about 150K
and about 250K Daltons, or about 180K and about 220K Daltons, or about 190K and about 210K
Daltons, or about 195K and about 205K Daltons.
[0043]      In another embodiment, the matrix agent has a molecular weight between about 100K
and about 200K Daltons. Particularly, the matrix agent has a molecular weight between about

 120K and about 180K Daltons, or about 130K and about 170K Daltons, or about 140K and about
 160K Daltons, or about 145K and about 155K Daltons.
[0044]     In another embodiment, the matrix agent has a molecular weight between about 50K
and about 150K Daltons. Particularly, the matrix agent has a molecular weight between about
80K and about 120K Daltons, or about 85K and about 115K Daltons, or about 90K and about
 110K Daltons, or about 95K and about 105K Daltons.
[0045]     In another embodiment, the matrix agent has a molecular weight between about 50K
and about 100K Daltons. Particularly, the matrix agent has a molecular weight between about
55K and about 95K Daltons, or about 60K and about 90K Daltons, or about 65K and about 85K
Daltons, or about 70K and about 80K Daltons.
[0046]     The performance of the matrix agent and the formulation is also dependent on the
amount of matrix agent present in the formulation. The formulation, or final dosage form, may
contain about 10 Wt% to about 90 Wt% matrix agent.
[0047]     In one embodiment, the formulation contains between about 40 Wt% and 60 Wt%
matrix agent. Particularly, the formulation contains between about 45 Wt% and about 55 Wt%
matrix agent, or about 48 Wt% and about 52 Wt% matrix agent.
[0048]     In another embodiment, the formulation contains between about 35 Wt% and 55 Wt%
matrix agent. Particularly, the formulation contains between about 40 Wt% and about 50 Wt%
matrix agent, or about 43 Wt% and about 47 Wt% matrix agent.
[0049]     In another embodiment, the formulation contains between about 30 Wt% and 50 Wt%
matrix agent. Particularly, the formulation contains between about 35 Wt% and about 45 Wt%
matrix agent, or about 38 Wt% and about 42 Wt% matrix agent.
[0050]     In another embodiment, the formulation contains between about 25 Wt% and 45 Wt%

matrix agent, or about 33 Wt% and about 37 Wt% matrix agent.
[0051]     In another embodiment, the formulation contains between about 20 Wt% and 40 Wt%
matrix agent. Particularly, the formulation contains between about 25 Wt% and about 35 Wt%
matrix agent, or about 28 Wt% and about 32 Wt% matrix agent.

 [0052]      In another embodiment, the formulation contains between about 15 Wt% and 35 Wt%
matrix agent. Particularly, the formulation contains between about 20 Wt% and about 30 Wt%
matrix agent, or about 23 Wt% and about 27 Wt% matrix agent.
[0053]       The dosage form of the present disclosure can also be rendered abuse deterrent by
incorporating at least one plasticizer in the formulation. The plasticizer may provide the dosage
form with a waxiness upon exposure to physical or mechanical forces, such as pulverizing or
grinding. Suitable plasticizers may be selected from the group consisting of polyalkalene glycols
(e.g., polyethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether), acetyltributyl citrate,
acetyltriethyl citrate, castor oil, diacetylated monoglycerides, dibutyl sebacate, diethyl phthalate,
glycerin, propylene glycol, pullulan, sorbitol sorbitan solution, triacetin, tributyl citrate and
triethyl citrate. In one embodiment, the plasticizer is polyethylene glycol.
[0054]       The performance of the plasticizer is dependent on the size and the amount of
plasticizer present in the formulation. In one embodiment, the plasticizer cannot be filtered
and/or separated from a resulting solution of water and/or alcohol. The formulation of the present
disclosure may include a plasticizer having a molecular weight between about 1K Daltons and
about 15K Daltons. Particularly, the molecular weight is between about 2K Daltons and about
14K, about 3K and about 13K Daltons, about 5K and about 10K Daltons, or about 7K and about
9K Daltons.
[0055]       The formulation, or final dosage form, may contain between about 5.0 Wt% and
about 60 Wt% plasticizer. In one embodiment, the formulation contains between about 20 Wt%
and about 60 Wt% plasticizer. Particularly, the formulation contains between about 30 Wt% and
about 50 Wt% plasticizer, or about 35 Wt% and about 45 Wt% plasticizer. In another
embodiment, the formulation contains between about 15 Wt% and about 30 Wt%. plasticizer.
Particularly, the formulation contains between about 20 Wt% and about 28 Wt% plasticizer, or
about 23 Wt% and about 27 Wt% plasticizer. In another embodiment, the formulation contains
between about 5.0 Wt% and about 20 Wt% plasticizer. Particularly, the formulation contains
between about 8.0 Wt% and about 17 Wt% plasticizer, or about 10 Wt% and about 15 Wt%
plasticizer.
[0056]       The dosage form of the present disclosure may also contain a filler/binder excipient
(herein "filler"). A filler may be added to provide or increase the consistency of the extrudate for

      WO 2015/023675                                                          PCT/US2014/050737

processing into a final dosage form. The filler may also help with hardness and dissolution of
the dosage form. The filler may be a known excipient for use in pharmaceutical formulations
that, upon extrusion, is capable of producing an extrudate that holds its shape. In some
 embodiments, the filler may have a melting temperature above the extrusion process
temperatures, such as a melting temperature above about 80 0 C, 90 0C, 100 0 C, 110 0 C, 120 0 C,
or 130 'C. The filler may also be a material that exhibits excellent flow and compression
properties, wherein such flow and compression properties are measured by traditional methods
known to persons skilled in the art of pharmaceutical formulations.
 [0057]      The filler may be selected from the group consisting of microcrystalline cellulose,
silicified microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, maize starch, modified maize starch,
potato starch, lactose monohydrate, lactose anhydrous, mannitol, dibasic calcium phosphate
dihydrate, anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate, magnesium carbonate, erythritol, trehalose and
mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the filler is microcrystalline cellulose and/or lactose
monohydrate.
 [0058]      In some embodiments, the filler may also be useful as a disintegrant. For example,
the inclusion of 10% or more of a filler, e.g., microcrystalline cellulose, also acts as a
disintegrant.
[0059]       The performance of the filler and the formulation is also dependent on the amount of
filler present in the formulation. The formulation, or final dosage form, may contain between
about 0 Wt% and about 40 Wt% filler. In one embodiment, the formulation contains between
about 10 Wt% and about 40 Wt% filler. Particularly, the formulation contains between about 20
Wt% and about 40 Wt% filler, about 30 Wt% and about 40 Wt% filler, about 32 Wt% and about
38 Wt% filler, or about 34 Wt% and about 36 Wt% filler. In another embodiment, the
formulation contains between about 25 Wt% and about 35 Wt% filler. Particularly, the
formulation contains between about 27 Wt% and about 33 Wt% filler, or about 29 Wt% and
about 31 Wt% filler. In another embodiment, the formulation contains between about 20 Wt%
and about 30 Wt% filler. Particularly, the formulation contains between about 22 Wt% and
about 28 Wt% filler, or about 24 Wt% and about 26 Wt% filler. In another embodiment, the
formulation contains between about 10 Wt% and about 20 Wt% filler. Particularly, the
formulation contains between about 12 Wt% and about 18 Wt% filler, or about 14 Wt% and

      WO 2015/023675                                                          PCT/US2014/050737
                                                  13
about 16 Wt% filler. In another embodiment, the formulation of the present disclosure excludes
a filler.
[0060]      In one embodiment, the formulation includes a disintegrant. A disintegrant promotes
disintegration of the pill, and dissolution of the active substance, after administration and upon
contact with water. The disintegrant may be selected from sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked
polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium bicarbonate/citric acid, alginic acid or combinations thereof. The
formulation, or final dosage form, may contain between about 1.0 Wt% and about 20 Wt% of
disintegrant. Particularly, the formulation contains between about 1.0 Wt% and about 10 Wt%
disintegrant. In another embodiment, the formulation of the present disclosure excludes a
disintegrant.
[0061]      In another embodiment, the, formulation includes a dye. A dye is useful to distinguish
or identify the pill of the present disclosure from other drug products. The dye may be selected
from known dyes suitable for use in pharmaceutical formulations or approved by the FDA for
such use. For example, the dye may be FD&C Blue No. 2 or a 50/50 Wt% blend of FD&C Blue
No. 2 in polyethylene glycol. In one embodiment, the dye and polyethylene glycol blend cannot
be substantially filtered and/or separated from a resulting solution of water and/or alcohol. The
formulation, or final dosage form, may contain between about 0.10 Wt% and about 15 Wt% dye.
Particularly, the formulation may contain between about 0.20 Wt% and about 12.5 Wt% dye, or
about 0.50 Wt% and about 10 Wt% dye. In some embodiments, the formulation contains at least
0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.5%, 0.8%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0%, 4.5%, 5.0%, 5.5%,
6.0%, 6.5%, 7.0%, 7.5%, 8.0%, 8.5%, 9.0%, 9.5%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, and 20%
dye. These values can also be used to define a range of dye present in the formulations, e.g.,
about 3.0% to about 5.0%. In another embodiment, the formulation of the present disclosure
excludes a dye.
[0062]      In another embodiment, the formulation includes a preservative or antioxidant. The
preservative or antioxidant reduces or limits the degradation or deterioration of the abuse
deterrent dosage form. For example, the components of the oral drug delivery system (e.g.,
active substances, matrix agents) may undergo degradation (e.g., oxidative reduction, chain
cleavage) due to oxidation. Preventing degradation is essential to maintaining a proper release
profile. For instance, the molecular weight of polyethylene oxide in the formulation affects the

     WO 2015/023675                                                         PCT/US2014/050737
                                                14
release profile of the active substance. The addition of a preservative or antioxidant in the
formulation that reduces or eliminates the degradation of the molecular weight of polyethylene
oxide is useful to maintain the release profile of the active substance.
[0063]      The preservative or antioxidant may be selected from preservatives or antioxidants
known to one skilled in the art for use in pharmaceutical formulations, such as citric acid,
ascorbic acid, ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene
(BHT), erythorbic acid, hypophosphorous acid, lactobionic acid, monothioglycerol, potassium
metabisulfite, propyl gallate, racemethionine, sodium bisulfite, sodium formaldehyde
sulfoxylate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite, sodium thiosulfate, stannous chloride, sulfur
dioxide and tocopherols. The formulation, or final dosage form, may contain between about 0.1
Wt% and about 2.0 Wt%, or about 0.25 Wt% and about 0.75 Wt% of preservative or antioxidant..
In another embodiment, the formulation of the present disclosure excludes a preservative or
antioxidant.
[0064]      In some embodiments, the dosage form includes one or more agents that decrease the
purity of the active substance in an alcohol solution or extraction product. The alcohol purity
decreasing agent can reduce or limit the potential for abuse by decreasing the total weight
percent of active substance found in the alcohol solution or alcohol based extraction by
increasing the amount of other substances also found in the solution or extraction. For example, a
common form of abuse involves extraction of active substance using ethanol, or ethanol
solutions (e.g., 1% - 99% ethanol), resulting in a very pure powder. When introduced to an
alcohol solution, components of the oral drug delivery system containing an alcohol purity
decreasing agent (e.g., active substances, excipients) may become dissolved in the solution,
creating a homogenous liquid which prevents extraction and subsequent alcohol evaporation to a
very pure active substance. In one embodiment, the alcohol purity decreasing agent substantially
decreases the purity of a resulting alcohol and/or water solution or powder. In another
embodiment, the alcohol purity decreasing agent is not soluble in water. The dosage form may
contain between about 0.1 wt% to 40 wt% alcohol purity decreasing agent. In some
embodiments, the formulation contains at least 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 3.0%, 4.0%,
5.0%, 6.0%, 7.0%, 8.0%, 9.0%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%,
21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 31%, 32%, 33%, 34%, 35%, 36%,
37%, 38%, 39%, 40% alcohol purity decreasing agent. These values can also be used to define a

range of agent present in the formulations, e.g., about 5.0% to about 15.0%. In another
embodiment, the dosage form of the present disclosure excludes an alcohol purity decreasing
agent.
 [0065]      The alcohol purity decreasing agent may be selected from excipients known to one
skilled in the art for use in pharmaceutical formulations, such as alginic acid, calcium acetate,
carbomers, carboxymethylcellulose, ethylcellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose,
hydroxypropyl cellulose, methylcellulose, poloxamers, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate,
polyvinylpyrrolidone, and sodium alginate. In a specific embodiment, the agent is calcium
acetate.
[0066]       In some embodiments, the alcohol purity decreasing agent reducing the purity of a
resulting alcohol and/or water solution or powder by at least 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%,
 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95%.
These values can also be used to define a range of purity reduction, e.g., about 10% to about
30%.
[0067]       The formulation may additionally include at least one additive independently selected
from surfactants, bulking agents, lubricants, flavorings or combination thereof.
[0068]       The abuse deterrent pill of the present disclosure is capable of immediate release of
the active substance. The dosage form may be manufactured to provide a composition exhibiting
an immediate release profile of at least one active substance. As used herein, "immediate
release" refers to a dosage form that releases the active substance or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof, substantially completely into the gastrointestinal tract of the user within a
period of less than an hour, and often less than about 45 minutes from ingestion. In one
embodiment, the amount of active substance released from the dosage form, e.g. oxycodone HCl,
by exposure to a deairated water within 45 minutes is greater than or equal to 75%. In another
embodiment, the amount of active substance released from the dosage form, e.g. hydrocodone
bitartrate/acetaminophen, by exposure to a 0.1 N hydrochloric acid solution within 30 minutes is
great than or equal to 90%.
[0069]       In one embodiment, the formulation of the present disclosure releases greater than or
equal to about 75% of the active substance within 45 minutes after administration or via
dissolution testing. Particularly, the formulation releases greater than or equal to about 80%,

     WO 2015/023675                                                          PCT/US2014/050737

about 85%, about 90%, or about 95% of the active substance within 45 minutes after
administration or via dissolution testing.
[0070]      In other embodiments, the formulation of the present disclosure releases greater than
or equal to about 90% of the active substance within 30 minutes after administration or via
dissolution testing. Particularly, the formulation releases greater than or equal to about 92%,
about 94%, about 96%, or about 98% of the active substance within 30 minutes after
administration or via dissolution testing.
[0071]      The formulation of the present disclosure is abuse deterrent and does not rapidly
release the active substance within a relatively short time after administration or dissolution
testing begins. In some embodiments, the formulation of the present disclosure releases less than
about 95% of the active substance within 20 minutes after administration or via dissolution
testing. Particularly, the formulation releases less than about 90% of the active substance, less
than about 85%, less than about 80%, less than about 75%, less than about 70%, less than about
65%, or less than about 60% within 20 minutes after administration or via dissolution testing.
[0072]      In other embodiments, the formulation of the present disclosure releases less than
about 95% of the active substance within 15 minutes after administration or via dissolution
testing. Particularly, the formulation releases less than about 90% of the active substance, less
than about 85%, less than about 80%, less than about 75%, less than about 70%, less than about
65%, or less than about 60% within 15 minutes after administration or via dissolution testing.
[0073]      In one embodiment, the present disclosure relates to an oral, immediate release, abuse
deterrent dosage form comprising an active substance susceptible to abuse, wherein less than
about 95% of the active substance is released from the dosage form within 20 minutes following
administration, and wherein greater than or equal to 75% of the active substance is released from
the dosage form within 45 minutes following administration. In another embodiment, the
present disclosure relates to an oral, immediate release, abuse deterrent dosage form comprising
an active substance susceptible to abuse, wherein less than about 95% of the active substance is
released from the dosage form within 15 minutes following administration, and wherein greater
than or equal to 90% of the active substance is released from the dosage form within 30 minutes
following administration.

     WO 2015/023675                                                             PCT/US2014/050737

[0074]       The formulation, or abuse deterrent pill, may also include at least one physical barrier
to reduce abuse. The physical barrier may be the inability of the pill to be abused by pulverizing
and swallowing, pulverizing and snorting, pulverizing and injecting, or combinations thereof.
For example, the abuse deterrent pill of the present disclosure may be incapable of being
significantly pulverizing by physical or mechanical force.
[0075]       One of the most common means of abuse of an orally administered opioid analgesic
involves the manipulation of the oral dosage form in order to cause rapid delivery to the
bloodstream via nasal insufflation. In order for insufflation to be used as an effective means of
abuse, the original dosage form must be manipulated so as to decrease the particle size of the
ingested drug to about 0.5 mm or less. A particle size of about 0.5 mm or less is necessary for
effective intranasal absorption to occur. By limiting the quantity of particles under about 0.5 mm
that an abuser can obtain by reasonable methods, one can render insufflation ineffective as a
means of abuse. One way this physical barrier may be created is by capturing the active
substance susceptible to abuse in a plastic matrix which is resistant to being physically broken
down to produce particles smaller than about 0.5 mm.
[0076]       The dosage form of the present disclosure can inhibit manipulation by grinding or
pulverizing using common equipment, such as a coffee grinder. For example, the formulation
deters abuse by limiting the particle size to which the formulation may be ground. The
formulation prevents the pill, or at least substantial portions of the pill, from being ground in
particles having a particle size of about 0.5 mm or less that may pass through the membrane of
the nasal cavity. The dosage form can also significantly limit the extraction of the active
substance by common solvents (e.g., cold water or distilled aqueous ethanol) from the
formulation. For example, the formulation deters abuse by limiting the ability of persons to
extract the active substance from the formulation (either intentionally or unintentionally), such
that the active substance cannot easily be concentrated for parenteral administration. The abuse
deterrent formulation may also include, but does not require, the incorporation of other deterrents
such as antagonists or irritants.
[0077]       In one embodiment, the abuse deterrent pill of the present disclosure may be
incapable of being crushed by grinding into a form that may be abused. In a coffee grinder assay
as described in Example 1 (e.g., grinding in a coffee grinder at about 20,000+ rpm and for about

     WO 2015/023675                                                            PCT/US2014/050737
                                                 18
3 0-60 seconds) the pill remains in a form that may not be abused. The coffee grinder assay may
be performed using a commercial coffee grinder, or equivalent, capable of grinding abuse
deterrent pills. The pills tested using the coffee grinder assay have a substantial portion of the
resulting particles with a particle size which is not able to be abused, i.e. intranasal administered.
Abuse deterrent pills having a substantial amount of such particles reduce the incentive or cost
effectiveness of persons to abuse the formulations. For example, a potential abuser who can only
access for intranasal administration less than about 50% of the active substance will be deterred
from abusing the formulation.
[0078]       Upon exposure to a grinding force (e.g., the coffee grinder assay or equivalent), the
abuse deterrent pill may be grinded into particles wherein at least about 50 Wt% of the grinded
particles have a particle size greater than about 0.5 mm. Particularly, upon exposure to a
grinding force, the abuse deterrent pill may be grinded into particles wherein at least about 55
Wt% of the grinded particles, 60 Wt% of the grinded particles, 65 Wt% of the grinded particles,
70 Wt% of the grinded particles, 75 Wt% of the grinded particles, 80 Wt% of the grinded
particles, 85 Wt% of the grinded particles, 90 Wt% of the grinded particles, or 95 Wt% of the
grinded particles have a particle size greater than about 0.5 mm.
[0079]       In another embodiment, the abuse deterrent pill of the present disclosure may be
capable of forming a hydrogel upon exposure to an aqueous or semi-aqueous solution. The
formation of the hydrogel deters abuse by limiting the ability of persons to extract the active
substance from the formulation, such that the active substance cannot easily be concentrated for
parenteral administration.
[0080]       In some embodiments, the abuse deterrent pill of the present disclosure is capable of
releasing its dye upon introduction to an aqueous or semi-aqueous solution. The dye provides a
visual deterrent to abuse via parenteral administration by giving the solution a turbid and/or deep
color. In some embodiments, the dye is not capable of being separated from the solution via
nylon, PTFE, coffee or other readily available filters or filtering techniques.
[0081]       In another embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a process for the production
of an oral, immediate release, abuse deterrent pill containing at least one active substance
susceptible to abuse comprising processing a uniform blend of the at least one active substance

     WO 2015/023675                                                           PCT/US2014/050737

susceptible to abuse, a matrix agent and a plasticizer by hot melt extrusion to produce an
extrudate. The extrudate may therein be formed using a forming unit into the pill.
[0082]      Hot melt extrusion is a processing technique used to make the formulations and
compositions of the present disclosure because it allows for the creation of homogeneous
polymer matrices with specific abuse deterrent properties. For example, by varying the
formulation and the processing parameters specific properties such as dissolution time,
pulverization resistance, material processability, and stability can be selectively modified.
Formulations that include polymer matrix agents (e.g., polyethylene oxide) can provide a unique
advantage as they allow for formulations in which release characteristics can be controlled while
also creating a physical barrier that prevents abuse (e.g., through means of nasal inhalation or
intravenous injection). Furthermore, in a hot melt extrusion process, process analytic data can be
provided in real time. The process may also be adapted for continuous process manufacturing
procedure as opposed to traditional batch to batch processing.
[0083]      The abuse deterrent pill of the present disclosure may be formed by hot melt
extrusion using commercially available extruders, such as a twin screw extruder. Several factors
of the extrusion process may affect the final extrudate including: screw design (sheer rating),
screw speed, temperature profile, feed rate, dwell time, die pressure and die size. These factors
may be varied to obtain an extrudate with desired processing capabilities such that the extrudate
is uniform, holds its shape, and is capable of being formed into pills by a forming unit.
[0084]      An exemplary extruder and forming unit system (10) is shown in Figure 1. The
extruder (14) includes a hopper or feeding unit (12) wherein a uniform blend of the formulation
is made or transferred to. The uniform blend is fed into the inlet (16) of the extruder (14) by
starve feeding via a gravimetric or volumetric dosing unit. The formulation of the present
disclosure is preferably uniformly blended prior to introduction to the extrusion process.
Insufficient blending of the components may produce a non-uniform extrudate and non-uniform
abuse deterrent pills having inconsistent amounts of active substance. Over-blending may
produce a poorly performing formulation. The blending process may be monitored using a
process analytical technique to determine when a uniform blend is achieved. In one
embodiment, the mixing bin or hopper (12) may be equipped with a near-infrared (NIR)
monitoring system for in-line, continuous monitoring of the blend.

                                                20
[0085]       In one embodiment, monitoring of the blending process by NIR involves preparing a
NIR standard spectrum for each formulation. The NIR standard spectra may be prepared
empirically by monitoring the blending of different batches of the formulation. The blending
conditions and/or extrusion process may be correlated with NIR spectra to determine a NIR
standard spectrum for a given dosage form. Once the optimum NIR monitoring spectrum and
conditions are determined, the formulation is blended until the NIR standard is achieved. One of
ordinary skill in the art armed with the present disclosure can implement a near-infrared
monitoring system for in-line, continuous monitoring of the blend.
[0086]       The extruder (14) then processes the blend into a melt and passes the extrudate (50)
out of the extruder (14) through a die section (30) and through a die outlet (18). The extruder
(14) may have temperature zones (20-30) and pressure zone (40-43). These zones may include
components to heat and pressurize the extruder (14) or may include sensors to measure the
temperature and/or pressure of each particular zone.
[0087]       As used herein the term melt temperature refers to the temperature at which an
excipient changes from solid to liquid state. As used herein the term softening temperature refers
to the temperature at which an excipient changes from solid form into a malleable, dynamic
solid.
[0088]       The temperature profile of the extruder (14) is important to obtain a uniform
extrudate (50) with little to no degradation products. Heat may be applied to soften, and in some
embodiments to melt, the excipients (e.g., matrix agent, plasticizer) to form a homogenous
matrix to encapsulate the active substance. The extruder temperature profile, or the temperatures
in the extruder zones (20-30), is preferably kept below the melting point, and often the
degradation point, of the active substance.
[0089]       For example, the melting temperature of polyethylene oxide is about 67 'C and of
polyethylene glycol is about 63 'C. Common active substances begin to melt at temperatures
much higher than this. For example, the melt temperature of oxycodone HCl is about 219 'C
and of hydrocodone bitartrate is about 147 'C. Preferably, the temperature of one or more of the
zones (20-30) is kept at or below the melting point of the active pharmaceutical ingredients. In
particular, the temperature of one or more of the zones (20-30) is kept below about 120 OC, 110
-C, 100 0 C, 90 'C, 80 -C, 75 0 C, 70 'C, 65 'C, or 60 C.

0 C, about 90 'C, about 80 'C, about 75 0C, about 70 'C, about 65 'C, or about 60 'C.

temperature of at least four of the zones is kept below about 120 'C, about 110 'C, about 100 'C,
about 90 'C, about 80 'C, about 75 'C, about 70 'C, about 65 'C, or about 60 'C.

[0097]      The temperature of the die (18, 30) may be maintained at a slightly higher
temperature than the temperature of one or more of the other zones. In some embodiments, the
die temperature (18, 30) is held at or slightly above the melting point of the extrudate, or the
matrix and plasticizer, to ensure a uniform extrudate (50) exiting the die outlet (18).
[0098]      The extruder (14) also has a pressure profile. Pressure is important to melt the
excipients to make mixing more efficient and to force the extrudate (50) through the die outlet
(18) to exit the extruder (14) in a consistent manner. Particularly, the pressures in the zones and
also the pressure at the die outlet (18), is kept at or above about 5 bar, about 10 bar, about 15 bar,
about 20 bar, about 30 bar, about 40 bar, about 50 bar, about 60 bar, about 70 bar, about 80 bar,
about 90 bar, about 100 bar or about 110 bar.
[0099]      In one embodiment, the pressure of one or more of the pressure zones (40-43) in the
extruder (14) is kept at a high enough pressure to achieve melting, compression, and mixing of
the matrix and plasticizing agents with non-melting excipients (e.g., API, filler, disintegrants,
and antioxidant) while the temperature of one or more of the temperature zones (20-30) is at or
slightly below the melting point at standard pressure of these agents. The increased pressure
allows for more efficient mixing due to compaction and shearing forces without having to
dramatically increase temperature. These lower temperatures reduce, or substantially eliminate,
the formation of degradation products from the active substances. In one embodiment, the
pressure produced on the die (43) of the extruder (14) is kept sufficiently high enough to reduce
pulsating flow and ensure a uniform extrudate (50) is delivered though the die outlet (18). A
sufficiently high pressure assists in compacting the homogenous melt into a processable strand of
desired diameter.
[00100]     In one embodiment, the pressure of at least one of the pressure zones (40-43) is kept
at a high enough pressure to achieve melting, compression, and mixing of the matrix and
plasticizing agents with the active substance and any non-melting excipients. Particularly, the
pressure of at least one of the zones is kept at or above about 5 bar, about 10 bar, about 15 bar,

[00104]     The melt extrudate may be optionally analyzed within the extruder (14) using near
infrared technology. NIR spectroscopy can be used as a non-invasive alternative to high
performance liquid chromatography techniques. A NIR probe (80) may be included within the
extruder (14). The wavelengths and intensities at which raw organic materials of the melt
extrudate absorb light energy can be plotted to produce spectra to compare against a standard.
With the spectrum of the API known, it can be used to determine and monitor the % wt of the
active pharmaceutical ingredient present in the extrudate in real time.
[00105]     The extrudate from an extruder is directly formed into a pill using a forming unit,
provided that the size or shape of the extrudate may be adjusted prior to introduction to the
forming unit (e.g., via a rope sizer). In some embodiments, the extrudate is directly formed into
a dosage form without a further processing step, such as a cutting or milling step. The forming
unit may be a unit capable of forming the pill without cutting or milling the extrudate. The
forming unit may be a calendar, rotary, or a chain forming machine. As shown in Figure 1, the
extrudate (50) may be shaped into the abuse deterrent form (70) by a forming unit (60). In one

     WO 2015/023675                                                          PCT/US2014/050737
                                                24
embodiment, the extrudate (50) is shaped into the abuse deterrent form (70) by a calendaring
process.
 [00106]     The forming unit (60) may comprise two rotating components each having molds (62)
inset in the rotating components and aligned such that the molds (62) overlap with each other as
the rotating components interface. When the extrudate (50) is guided between the rotating
components of the forming unit (60), the offset and aligned molds (62) (or cavities) accept the
extrudate and form the extrudate into the dosage form as provided by the shape of the molds
(62), provided a sufficient amount of extrudate is guided between and supplied to the rotating
components.
[00107]      In another embodiment, the forming unit may also comprise of a rotating set of punch
dies with accompanying pinching ring, e.g. a chain die forming unit. Figure 2 shows an
embodiment of a chain forming unit. The chain forming unit includes an upper and lower chain
system (110 and 112) and tooling (100) to form an incoming extrudate (56) into formed pills
(19). When the extrudate (56) is fed into the chain die forming unit, the ring tooling (100)
pinches the extrudate (56) to the exact weight of the finished pill and simultaneously presses it
into a final form by the punches via a cam track. In one embodiment, the centripetal forces
produced by the rotation of the machine aid in the ejection of the final pill form (19).
[00108]      The extruder / forming unit system (10) may also be equipped with an additional
component or transfer unit to assist the transfer of the extrudate (50) from the extruder (14) to the
forming unit (60). The transfer unit may be capable of controlling the temperature, pressure,
environment and/or shape of the extrudate. For example, the transfer unit may include
heated/cooled sizing rollers which process the extrudate (50) into a consistent size (e.g.,
diameter) before entering the forming unit, cooling air jets, and extrudate diameter monitoring.
The transfer unit may also be capable of guiding the extrudate into and between the rotating
components of the forming unit (60).
[00109]      For example, the extrudate may be adjusted by an apparatus that re-sizes the
extrudate, re-shapes the extrudate, or both. Figure 3 shows an embodiment of an extrudate sizing
apparatus (e.g., rope sizer). The rope sizer includes a number of consecutive rollers (90-96) to
re-size or re-shape an incoming extrudate (52), either from the extruder (14) or from another
step. The number, shape and orientation of the rollers (90-96) may vary depending on the degree

     WO 2015/023675                                                         PCT/US2014/050737
                                                 25
of re-sizing and/or re-shaping desired. In some embodiments, the extrudate will be re-sized into
a smaller diameter extrudate. In these embodiments, the rotating rollers will rotate at
consecutively faster speeds. As such, the re-sized and/or re-shaped extrudate having a smaller
diameter will be moving at a faster speed exiting the rope sizer.
 [00110]     The size and shape of the extrudate (50) may be designed to efficiently interact with
different shaped molds (62). For example, an oval shaped extrudate may be formed to interact
with a wide and shallow set of molds (62). Also, the speed and mass (or volume) of the
extrudate (50) may be designed to efficiently interact with the size and speed of the forming unit.
The speed and mass (or volume) of the extrudate (50) guided between the rotating components
of the forming unit (60) should be sufficient to fill each set of molds completely with no voids.
[00111]      The size and shape, and the speed and mass (or volume) of the extrudate (50) as well
as size and shape of the molds (62) and the speed of the forming unit may be matched to reduce
the amount of excess extrudate that is not formed into the dosage form (e.g., reduce waste). The
two processes may be synchronized by attaching both to the same drive system. Preferably, the
forming unit is capable of forming abuse deterrent pills from the extrudate wherein more than
about 90% of the extrudate is utilized (e.g., formed into the dosage form). More preferably, the
forming unit utilizes more than about 95% of the extrudate. Even more preferably, the forming
unit utilizes more than about 99% of the extrudate.
[00112]      The molds (62) may optionally be formed with a non-uniform bottom or lower
surface to allow for easy removal of the pill after formation. The molds (62) may also have
markings in the bottom or lower surface to provide marking on the abuse deterrent pills upon
formation.
[00113]      After formation, the quality, volume and weight of each pill may be determined using
an automated optical inspection technique. The optional inspection technique combines a weight
determination step and a visual inspection step into a single step. For example, the visualization
step may include taking multiple pictures of each pill. From these pictures, an estimated volume
is determined. The estimated volume and the pre-determined density of the composition of the
formulation may provide an estimated weight for each pill. Those pills that satisfy certain
quality, volume and weight criteria will pass the optical inspection.

a matrix agent, and a plasticizer in a hopper to form a mixture; blending the mixture in the

[00120]      Immediate release abuse deterrent pills containing acetaminophen were manufactured
according to the formulation provided in Table 1.
[00121]     The formulation was blended prior to extrusion. Extrusion was performed by means
of a twin screw extruder of type Coperion ZSK26. To achieve a uniform extrudate with good
processing capabilities a medium sheer screw design was used at a relatively slow screw speed
(120RPM). The temperature profile was designed to immediately melt the matrix and plasticizer
agents (e.g., the polyethylene oxide and polyethylene glycol). Thereafter, the temperature was
adjusted to be at or slightly below the melting temperature of the extrudate at standard pressure
to achieve mixing. Adequate mixing was achieved by maintaining high pressures in the
extruder.
[00122]     At times, the die was heated to a temperature above the general melting temperature
of the extrudate. It was found that at die temperatures at the melting temperature of the
extrudate, the portion of the extrudate in contact with the inside die surface sheared off due to
friction. An increase in die temperature allowed the outside surface of the extrudate to melt and
slide along the die producing a uniform extrudate. Operating temperatures and pressures are
provided in Table 5. The temperature and pressure zones in Table 5 correspond to the zones
shown in Figure 1.

[00123]     The temperature profile, feed rate, and die size all have an effect on the pressure
produced on the die head. A die size of 3-5 mm was used. The temperature profile was kept

     WO 2015/023675                                                         PCT/US2014/050737

relatively static. The feed rate was adjusted to maintain a consistent and high pressure on the die
head of about 50 bar. A pressure maintained at the die head of about 50 bar or more produced
uniform extrudates.
 [00124]    A Carver Press was then used to form the extrudate into pills. A Carver Press is a
manual hand press which utilizes a free standing set of Natoli upper and lower punches that meet
at the die. Dedicated tooling was made for the experiment in order to produce an embossed, 100
mg pill.
 [00125]    The extrudate was hand cut, based on weight (100 mg). The die was placed on top of
the bottom punch, the cut extrudate was placed in the die cavity, and the top punch placed
through the top section of the die. The cut extrudate was formed into a pill at no more than 1
metric ton of force using the Carver Press and Natoli die set.
 [00126]    Dissolution Testing
 [00127]    The abuse deterrent pills prepared were tested for dissolution. Dissolution testing
was performed with reference to USP Monograph on Oxycodone HCl Tablets. These tests were
performed on a dissolution apparatus utilizing UPS <711> Apparatus II (Paddles), with 500 mL
de-aerated water as media and a paddle speed of 50 rpm. Japanese Sinker Baskets (Part Number
PSCUSBSK-JPMAG) were utilized. A 1 mL sample was pulled at 20 and 45 minutes and
submitted for HPLC analysis. HPLC conditions were taken from the USP Monograph in order
to observe the release of acetaminophen. The HPLC conditions are as follows: Injection
Volume: 20 pL; Flow Rate 1.5 mL/min; Detection: UV at 295 nm; Column Temp: 25 'C;
Autosampler Temperature: ambient; Gradient: Isocratic; and Runtime: 5 minutes. The
specification for this dissolution testing was NLT 75% (Q=70%) at 45 minutes.
[00128]     The weight percent of matrix agent (e.g., polyethylene oxide) in the formulation has a
direct correlation with both the release profile and ADF properties. The effect of varying the
weight percent of the matrix agent (e.g., polyethylene oxide) in the formulation on the release
properties and ADF was tested. Two different molecular weight polyethylene oxides were used,
namely 300K Daltons and 600K Daltons. The general formulation was tested for dissolution
using the two different polyethylene oxides (i.e., 300K Daltons and 600K Daltons). For these
experiments, polyethylene glycol was used to offset the differing weight percentages of PEO.

     WO 2015/023675                                                           PCT/US2014/050737
                                                 30
[00129]      Figure 4 shows the percent release of the active substance (i.e., acetaminophen
dissolution in 45 minutes) versus the weight percent of the matrix agent (e.g., polyethylene oxide
or PEO) for two similar abuse deterrent pill formulations having different molecular weight
matrix agents (e.g., 300K Daltons PEO vs. 600K Daltons PEO). Based on Figure 4, the more
polyethylene oxide present in the formulation the lower the percent release of active after 45
minutes.
[00130]      Abuse Deterrent Testing - Coffee Grinder Assay
[00131]      The abuse deterrent pills were also tested for resistance to pulverizing / grinding
using a coffee grinder assay. The tested formulations contained only 300K Dalton polyethylene
oxide. The Wt% of the polyethylene oxide was varied. Polyethylene glycol was again used to
offset the differing weight percentages of PEO. Three (3) pills for each specific Wt% of
polyethylene oxide were selected and placed in a commercially available coffee grinder (Mr.
Coffee@, model number IDS55). The coffee grinder was run for 30 seconds with occasional
pulsing. The grinded pills were tested for particle size analysis using a sonic sifter (screen size
35 Mesh) for 2 minutes. The 35 Mesh corresponds to a sieve size of 0.5 mm. The amount of
particles below 0.5 mm for each formulation is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5 shows that with
increasing weight percent of polyethylene oxide the ADF properties are enhanced. The percent
of particles smaller than 0.5 mm decreases with increasing weight percent of polyethylene oxide.
These results show that by increasing the content of polyethylene oxide the percentage of
particles small enough to be abused through means of insufflation is decreased.

[00135]     All of the abuse deterrent pills were tested for dissolution and abuse deterrence using
the tests described in Example 1. All abuse deterrent pills exhibited a greater than 80% of
particles having a particle size greater than 0.5 mm in the coffee grinder assay. All abuse
deterrent pills also exhibited a more than 75% release within 45 minutes during dissolution
testing.
[00136]     In particular, abuse deterrent pills containing oxycodone HCl were tested for
dissolution according to the test described in Example 1. The dissolution results, listed as

[00139]      As shown in Table 7, the release profile and the percent label claim for the abuse
deterrent pills on stability are comparable to each other and to the original pills. The release

for hardness, one containing acetaminophen and one containing oxycodone HCI.
[00146]      For each formulation, three (3) formed pills were tested for hardness. All the
hardness tested pills exhibited a hardness of > 999N.
[00147]      Example 3
[00148]      In order to attain the release profile required by USP standards for immediate release,
the use of a disintegrant was tested. Several disintegrants were evaluated including
croscarmellose sodium, sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium
bicarbonate/citric acid and alginic acid. These disintegrants work though several methods such
as swelling, wicking, and deformation in an aqueous environment to break up a formulation and
thus increase surface area to aid in rapid API release.
[00149]      Experiments utilizing polyethylene oxide 300K Daltons showed no significant
improvement in dissolution rates with increased weight percent of croscarmellose sodium (CCS).

CCS is water soluble and can form a gel at increasing percentages which may prevent
disintegration. Sodium starch glycolate (SSG) was tested and found to rapid swell with minimal
gelling effects. SSG was tested alone as well as with 5 Wt% and 10 Wt% sodium
bicarbonate/citric acid acting as an effervescent. All combinations produced passing dissolution
at 45 minutes. Additional experiments utilizing alginic acid produced similar passing dissolution
results at 45 minutes.
[00150]      Cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone was also tested. Cross-linked
polyvinylpyrrolidone was tested alone as well as with 5 Wt% and 10 Wt% sodium
bicarbonate/citric acid. Cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone also produced passing dissolution
results. Cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone is highly hydrophilic and water insoluble. It acts
through a wicking and swelling mechanism. Due to it being water insoluble, it does not form a
gel in any concentration. Cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone provided better dissolution results
regardless of Wt% sodium bicarbonate/citric acid which is believed to be due to its insoluble,
non-gel forming nature. Thus, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone was determined to be a
preferred disintegrant for this formulation.
[00151]      Extraction Example
[00152]      The inclusion of one or more dyes in a drug formulation is one method to render a
formulation abuse deterrent. Significant discoloration of an extraction product from a
formulation subject to abuse can discourage a potential abuser from using (e.g., injecting or
ingesting) the extraction product. A study was conducted to investigate the effect of dyes in the
formulations of the present disclosure. Extraction products from whole or cut formulations were
visually inspected to determine abuse deterrence following alcohol extraction, and also following
subsequent filtration.
[00153]      The purpose of this study is to perform and summarize the results of an alcohol
extraction, filtration, and visual examination of the resulting extraction solution for different
formulations. Formulations of CII narcotic drug products can be modified from their intended
dosage form in order to receive immediate release of the full dose of the active pharmaceutical
ingredient into the body. This is known as making the drug product "abusable." Formulation
development has occurred which is intended to reduce the ability of patients to modify the
products into this "abusable" form. Extrusion and compress-and-curing are two methods for

                                                  35
manufacturing CII drug products. Both methods, when formulated appropriately, possess
characteristics which reduce the ability of patients to modify the products into an "abusable"
form (when compared to traditional methods).
[00154]       Twin Screw extrusion can be described as mixing a blended formulation by using
shear forces. The co-rotating screws create shear/frictional forces through material contact
between the two screws and between the screws and barrel wall. The shear forces work on the
material based on its viscosity (inter-particulate friction) to create a homogenous polymer melt.
The heated barrels control the melt by maintaining constant temperatures in the various zones of
the extruder as well as add additional heat to maintain energy in the process. This happens in a
simultaneous continuous process while the material is transferred through the extruder. The
polymer melt can then be pushed through a die to form a uniform extrudate. This differs from
compress-and-curing which can be described as initially compressing (with force) the blended
formulation and then curing (with heat) after the compression in a separate sequential process to
produce a finished drug product. CII drug products which utilize each manufacturing method are
currently commercially available. In some embodiments, the formulation of the present
disclosure is formed by an extrusion process under sufficient shear stresses to impart strength
and stability to the formulation. The formulation can be prepared using an extruder wherein
shear forces, pressure, and heating are be applied together or separately in different zones of the
extruder. In some embodiments, the formulation is prepared by reaching a melt flow
temperature of the specific formulation in the extruder to assist in producing a uniform extrudate
(i.e., localized uniformity). Compress-and-curing formulations are not similarly prepared.
[00155]       Three principal methods of modifying CII drug products in order to make them
"abusable" exist, namely cutting, grinding, and extraction. Cutting the dosage form can be
performed in order to increase the surface area of the product prior to ingesting it in an effort to
increase the rate of dissolution into the digestive tract. Cutting can also be used to increase the
efficiency of extraction by breaking/removing the aqueous, non-ethanol soluble coating applied
to many commercially available drugs. Cutting alone, however, is not sufficient to render a
formulation abuseable. Readily available tools used for cutting are razor blades and common
kitchen scissors. Grinding the dosage form is performed in order to decrease the particle size of
the product in an effort to insufflate (snort) for immediate release into the blood vessels of the
nasal passages. Additional abuse pathways exist which follow the grinding of the product. A

                                                  36
readily available tool used for grinding is a commercially available coffee grinder. Extraction is
performed in order to dissolve the active pharmaceutical ingredient of the dosage form into a
liquid which can be filtered and subsequently swallowed, injected, or otherwise abused. A
readily available tool used for extraction is high potency alcohol (i.e., >190 proof (95%)).
[00156]     Color is one identifying characteristic of commercial drug products. Color can be
applied to the dosage form in two ways: dye or coating. High potency alcohol (i.e., >190 proof
(95%)) is one extraction solvent that can be used by abusers for APIs which are insoluble in
water or in order to separate the API from other water soluble excipients. Dyes or coatings can
potentially be used to alter the physical appearance of the extracted solution of drug product (i.e.,
turn the resulting solution a noticeable color).
[00157]     In this study, 190 proof ethanol was utilized as an extraction solvent. A commercially
available coffee filter was used to filter out any particulate matter of several drug products. The
resulting solution was analyzed for physical appearance. The difference in physical appearance
(if any) between drug products which are dyed or coated was evaluated.
[00158]     Additionally, a non ADF drug product which utilizes traditional compression
manufacturing methods (Roxicodone@ 15mg, manufactured by Mallinckrodt, Inc.) was
evaluated for comparison purposes.

(Immediate Release) and ADF Oxycodone 10mg and 80mg (Extended Release) as described in

[00162]      For each sample, both whole and cut dosage units were tested. For whole dosage
units, two (2) whole dosage units were placed in a 25mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 1OmL of
EtOH. For cut dosage units, all cut pieces of the dosage unit were placed in similar flasks. Cut
dosage units were cut into about 8 pieces using diagonal pliers. Each flask was sealed with
parafilm and shaken on a platform shaker for at least 10 hours at about 150rpm. The resulting
solution was filtered through a coffee filter to remove any particulate matter. The filtered
solution was collected in a 50mL Nessler color comparison tube. After 30 minutes, each sample
tube was visually examined for color (if any), clarity/turbidity, and if any noticeable difference in
filtered solution volume exists (i.e., a significant decrease from the original 1OmL EtOH). The
results for the whole and cut dosage units are provided in the two tables below.

 uniform in color after sitting for approximately 30 minutes, while samples 8-11 had significant
 sediment at the bottom of the comparison tubes. Samples 1, 6 and 7 had no noticeable sediment
 but were significantly less colored than the batches of the present disclosure.
 [00164]     Approximately 5mL of the filtrate from each cut dosage form sample was passed
through a 25mm, 0.2ptm PTFE Titan syringe filter (Scientific Resources, Inc. Cat No. 42225-PC,
Lot 709029003054). Each resulting solution was then assigned a number according to a scale of
 0-5, with 0 (zero) representing a sample with no color and 5 representing a sample with a dark,
significant color, (0 - no color; 1 - faint; 2 - light; 3 - medium; 4 - brilliant; and 5 - dark).
 Samples with at least light color, including dark coloration, can deter potential abusers from
injecting or ingesting the filtered extract (e.g., colors 2 and above, 3 and above, 4 and above, or
5). The table below shows the color number assignments for the syringe filtered cut dosage unit

water, alcohol or both. They are often formulated into the coatings of the drug formulations. In
some embodiment, the dyes are water soluble, alcohol soluble or both, and are dyes that are
approved for, or considered acceptable, for oral administration. In some instances, the solubility
of the dye in alcohol is important because of the potential for compounding effects of, and
interactions associated with, consuming both alcohol and the extracted API.

[00167]     The sediment observed at the bottom of the comparison tubes of the Oxycontin@
batches (samples 8-11) is indicative of a suspension rather than a solution. Typically,
suspensions can be centrifuged or filtered to obtain a more clear solution (and in some cases, a
colorless solution). Conversely, solutions cannot be further centrifuged or filtered using a
common household coffee filter or a readily available syringe filter to obtain a more clear
solution because the dye is completely dissolved in the solution. Dyed formulations can provide
an additional mechanism of abuse deterrence than coated formulations.

[00168]     The amount of dye present in the formulation can be an amount that produces an

greater than 0, or greater than 1, or greater than 2, or greater than 3 or greater than 4 on the visual

components present. In some embodiments, the formulation can contain at least 0.1% dye, at
least 0.2% dye, at least 0.3% dye, at least 0.4% dye, at least 0.5% dye, at least 0.6% dye, at least

[00169]     It was also observed that a volume change occurred (-3-4mL decrease) for samples 4
and 5 following extended filtration time. Certain excipients (e.g.,
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose) can cause the resulting solution to become too viscous to fully
pass through a coffee filter. Additional abuse deterrence (e.g., extended extraction time and
volume loss) can be obtained by formulations including hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, or
equivalents.

[00172]       Cutting Force Example
[00173]       The existing methodology used to evaluate abuse deterrence in regard to the cutting
or breaking of a dosage form is based on the USP's "tablet breaking force" test. This test defines
"tablet breaking force" as the force required to cause tablets to fail (i.e., break) in a specific
plane. The USP describes the test as follows "[t]he tablets are generally placed between two
platens, one of which moves to apply sufficient force to the tablet to cause fracture. The platens
should be parallel. Their faces should be polished smooth and precision-ground perpendicularly
to the direction of movement. Perpendicularity must be preserved during platen movement, and
the mechanism should be free of any bending or torsion displacements as the load is applied.
The contact faces must be larger than the area of contact with the tablet." Figure 6 shows
equipment capable of executing traditional "tablet breaking force" analysis.
[00174]       The USP further explains the applications of tablet breaking force and why it is
utilized in the industry. "Tablets must be able to withstand the rigors of handling and
transportation experienced in the manufacturing plant, in the drug distribution system, and in the
field at the hands of the end users (patients/consumers). Manufacturing processes such as
coating, packaging, and printing can involve considerable stresses, which the tablets must be able
to withstand. For these reasons, the mechanical strength of tablets is of considerable importance

     WO 2015/023675                                                           PCT/US2014/050737
                                                 45
and is routinely measured." The intent of these applications is for traditional formulations which
may be subjected to forces which could break the tablets (i.e., vigorous shaking in a tablet
bottle). The intent is not to address abuse deterrence potential. Furthermore, this test is only
applicable to and instructive to evaluate tablet formulations. The test is not applicable to or
instructive to evaluate pill, or other formulations, prepared by extrusion methodologies.
[00175]     In formulations utilizing excipients such as polyethylene oxide, and using such
excipients in an extrusion process, the parameter "tablet breaking force" does not apply. For
example, the long molecular chain lengths of the PEO (e.g., 100,000 Daltons - 7,000,000
Daltons) cause the drug product (relative to other traditional drug products) to be flattened, but
never actually "fail" (i.e., break) when applying "tablet breaking force" in the traditional sense.
The traditional application of "tablet breaking force" needs to be modified to evaluate
formulations containing malleable excipients (such as PEO) for the "cutting force" of the dosage
form, specifically dosage forms which are intended to deter abuse. The modification of the
traditional "tablet breaking force" test presented in this study consists of a change from the
"platens" utilized to cause the dosage forms to "fail" (i.e., break), namely from contact faces
"larger than the area of contact with the tablet" to sharp planes which mimic commonly used
tools for abuse. Figures 7, 8 and 9 show reference attachments including a fracture wedge set
(used to mimic common kitchen scissors, Figures 7 and 8 showing different views of the same
set) and a razor blade (Figure 9).
[00176]     The purpose of this study is to perform and summarize the cutting force needed to cut
different formulations of CII narcotic drug products. Texture analysis is the mechanical testing
of pharmaceutical products in order to measure their physical properties. A Texture Analyzer
XT2i can perform testing of numerous physical properties of pharmaceutical products, including
cutting force. The cutting force needed to cut several different formulations of CII narcotic drug
products utilizing different attachments on a Texture Analyzer (TE37) was investigated.
Multiple tools were utilized to cut drug products with the intent of abuse including'two
attachments which mimic readily available tools used for abuse (e.g., a razor blade and kitchen
scissors). The cutting force for all evaluated drug products were evaluated with each attachment.

7). The individual maximum cutting force needed to cut any tested CII narcotic drug products
utilizing the fracture wedge set was 163N (sample 6). The highest average cutting force needed
to cut any tested CII narcotic drug products utilizing the fracture wedge set was 156N (sample
6).
[00179]      All of the tested CII narcotic drug products can indeed be cut, and therefore
potentially be abused, with force which is substantially lower than what has been reported using
the breaking strength test or equivalent (>500N, See U.S. Patent US 8,309,060) utilizing
conventional means (i.e., common kitchen scissors or a razor blade). "Flattening" the tablets
utilizing forces >500N (with traditional "tablet breaking force" definitions) does not address
abuse deterrence potential in the tested CII narcotic drug products.
[00180]      In one embodiment, the formulation of the present invention exhibits a cutting
strength (i.e., force needed to cut the formulation) of greater than about 40 N, about 50 N, about
60 N, about 70 N, about 80 N, about 90 N, about 100 N, about 110 N, about 120 N, or about 130
N, or any range of these values (e.g., between about 40 N and about 120 N), as tested by either
the Cutting Force - Razor Blade test or by the Cutting Force - Fracture Wedge Set test, or both.
[00181]      Samples 4 of 5 of the present disclosure exhibit improved cutting strength compared
to the compress-and-cure samples (i.e., samples 8-11). Samples prepared via a compress-and
cure procedure undergo dry mixing of the components only. These components are then
compressed into a dosage form, and placing on a drying pan which applies heat to the dosage
form. It is believed that compress-and-cure dosage forms are not melted or similarly liquefied to
create significant homogeneity within the dosage form as compared to extrusion based

 procedures. The dosage formulations of the present invention are prepared by extrusion and,
 therefore, possess significant homogeneity as a result of the extrudate mixing within the extruder
 under melt flow conditions. The extrudate experiences high shear forces that produce the
 mechanical energy needed to ensure the required hardness and strength are achieved. The high
 shear forces can act on select components, for example PEO, to transform them into networks
 that exhibit increased strength and stability.
 [00182]     Grinding Example
 [00183]     The purpose of this study is to perform and summarize the grinding potential of
 different formulations of CII narcotic drug products. Texture analysis is the mechanical testing
 of pharmaceutical products in order to measure their physical properties. The Retsch Knife Mill
 GRINDOMIX GM200 (TE96) was utilized to mimic a commercially available coffee grinder
 (Mr. Coffee) in order to grind CII drug products into a particle size that is suitable for intranasal
abuse (insufflation). A commercially available coffee grinder was also evaluated for comparison
purposes. Particle size analysis was conducted utilizing an ATM L3P Sonic Sifter (TE47),
utilizing a 500 micrometer (tm) particle size sieve (35 mesh). For the purposes of this study,
any particle less than 500tm in diameter is considered suitable for intranasal abuse. It is
generally accepted as an industry standard that any particle greater than 500tm in diameter
cannot be sufficiently absorbed by the blood vessels in the nasal passages.
 [00184]     The Retsch Knife Mill GRINDOMIX GM200 utilizes a circular blade attachment to
mimic commercially available coffee grinders. The GM200 has a top speed of 10,000
revolutions per minute (rpm), while commercially available coffee grinders have a top speed of
approximately 20,000rpm (an approximate two-fold increase in speed when comparing the
GM200 to a Mr. Coffee grinder). However, the approximate two-fold increase in blade diameter
(118mm vs. 60mm, when comparing the GM200 to a Mr. Coffee grinder, respectively)
compensates for the approximate twofold decrease in top speed via the inversely proportional
relationship of the two variables. Further, the torque provided by the GM200 is significantly
higher than the torque provided by a Mr. Coffee grinder (0.860Nm (Newton meters) of the
GM200 vs. 0.062Nm of the Mr. Coffee grinder, respectively), which additionally illustrates the
ability (or lack thereof) of the Mr. Coffee grinder to modify the drug products into a particle size
suitable for intranasal abuse. The study evaluated the difference in particle sizes of several

GM200 and Mr. Coffee grinder.
[00185]     Additionally, a non ADF drug product which utilizes traditional compression
manufacturing methods (Roxicodone@ 15mg, manufactured by Mallinckrodt, Inc.) was
evaluated for comparison purposes.
[00186]     Experimental: The samples tested include those samples listed in Table A. The
formulations of the samples of the present disclosure tested are listed in Table B. The following
test equipment was used: Retsch Knife Mill GRINDOMIX GM200 (TE96), Coffee Grinder (Mr.
Coffee), ATM L3P Sonic Sifter (TE47), 500pm sieve (35 mesh) and a Shimpo Instruments
Tachometer (TE3 1). The following testing conditions were used: Analysis speed: 10,000rpm
(GM200), 20,000rpm (Mr. Coffee); Analysis time: 30 seconds; Sieve Size: 500gm (35 mesh);
Analysis time: 2 minutes (no pulse). Each sample was prepared in triplicate (N=3).
[00187]     For each sample, three (3) dosage units were weighed and tested. The following
conditions were used with the TE96: a 30 second analysis time and a speed of 10,000rpm. Both
parameters were set prior to each analysis. The composite sample was transferred to a tared
weigh boat and the weight of the sample was recorded. The following equation was used to
calculate the % sample loss:

[00188]     The weight of the 35 mesh sieve and sample pan was recorded. The testing apparatus
was assembled with the 35 mesh sieve above the sample pan. The composite sample was
transferred to the testing apparatus and analyzed utilizing the following parameters: 2 minute
analysis time and no pulse. The analyzed 35 mesh sieve and sample pan were weighed. The %
material remaining on the 35 mesh sieve (> 500gm) and in the sample pan (< 500pm) was
calculated using the following equation:
                                             Weight of Sample on Sieve (mg)
                    Percent on Sieve (%) = Total Weight of Sample on Sieve(mg)

13 shows the test results. The formulation passed dissolution testing. The formulation showed a
decrease in purity after extraction in alcohol. It is noted that the formulation showed significant
color after filtration with using about 4 wt% dye. Prior to filtering, the solutions were colored as
a result of the dye being present in the formulation. In general, filtering the solution with a
syringe filter did not substantially reduce the color of the filtrate. For nylon filters, however, a
substantial reduction in color was observed. It is believed that nylon has an affinity to the dye
used in the formulation. As a result, in some embodiments, a sufficient amount of dye is added
to saturate any filter (e.g., a nylon filter) used to filter the solution and also to allow the filtrate to
be colored (e.g., at least 1 wt% dye, at least 2 wt% dye, at least 3% dye, etc.)."

 [00197]    Extraction Procedure for ADF IR Extruded Pills
 [00198]    The extraction procedure involves testing the resultant purity of an extract using
alcohol and / or water as the extraction solvent. Here, four whole ADF 30mg IR pills were
placed in a 125mL Erlenmeyer flask. 40.0 mL of 190-proof ethanol (95%) was pipetted into the
flask. The flask was sealed and allowed to shake overnight on a platform shaker (concentration
of stock solution = 3 mg/mL oxycodone HCl).
[00199]     This procedure was repeated utilizing water as the extraction solvent.
[00200]     After approximately 12 hours, both flasks were removed from the platform shaker. A
portion was filtered through a 0.45 ptm nylon syringe filter into a 10 mL glass beaker. 5.0 mL of
this solution was pipetted into a 150 mL beaker and heated on a hot plate at -100 'C
(theoretically 15 mg of oxycodone HCl powder in solution). The heat was continuously added
until each solution evaporated. Both beakers were allowed to cool to room temperature and then
scraped with a metal spatula. The resulting powder was weighed and subsequently prepared for
chromatographic analysis.
[00201]     Each sample was weight corrected and analyzed for assay purity of oxycodone HCl.
[00202]     The assay purity is the percentage of oxycodone HCl in the extracted powder. As the
assay purity of oxycodone HCl decreases the amount of extracted powder necessary to achieve
higher oxycodone HCl content increases. Additionally, as the assay purity of oxycodone HCl
decreases, the excipient load present in the extracted powder increases. Therefore, it can be
concluded that drug products which provide, upon ethanol or water extraction, a lower assay
purity of oxycodone HCI in extracted powder are abuse deterrent. This deterrence is evident in
the following ways: cost effectiveness (i.e., the need for more powder to produce an equivalent
amount of oxycodone HCl); time effectiveness (i.e., a powder of lower purity containing
oxycodone HCl which cannot be separated from the excipients without complex, time
consuming chemistry procedures); and the potential for introducing a higher excipient load into
the body.
