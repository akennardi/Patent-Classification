 [0004]          Ponatinib hydrochloride is a small molecule pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor in clinical
 development for the treatment of adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast
 phase chronic myeloid leukemia            (CML)    or Philadelphia chromosome           positive acute
 lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor
 therapy.    Other tyrosine kinase inhibitors relevant to such CML or Ph+ALL therapy include
 GLEEVEC@        (imatinib   mesylate) and TASIGNA@         (nilotinib) (both    from    Novartis AG),
 SPRYCEL@ (dasatinib) (from Bristol Myers Squibb Company) and BOSULIF@ (bosutinib) (from
 Pfizer Inc). A New Drug Application for ponatinib hydrochloride was filed with the United States
 FDA on July 30, 2012.
 [0005)          In addition, ponatinib hydrochloride is potentially clinically useful for the treatment
 of other disorders or conditions implicated by the inhibition of other protein kinases. Such
 kinases and their associated disorders or conditions are mentioned in O'Hare, T., et at, Cancer
 Cell, Volume 16, Issue 5, 401-412 (2009) and WO 2011/053938, both of which are hereby
 incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.
 [0006]          Having an understanding of the potential polymorphic forms for an active
 pharmaceutical ingredient (API) such as ponatinib hydrochloride is useful in the development of
 a drug. This is because not knowing the specific polymorphic form present or desired in the API
 may result in inconsistent manufacturing of the API and as a result, results with the drug may
vary between various lots of the API.         In addition, it is important to discover the potential
 polymorphic forms of an API so that one can systematically determine the stability of that form
over a prolonged period of time for similar reasons.           Once a specific polymorphic form is
selected for pharmaceutical development, it is important to be able to reproducibly prepare that
polymorphic form.      It is also desirable for there to be a process for making an API such as
ponatinib hydrochloride in high purity due to the potential of impurities to affect the performance
ofthe drug.
[0007]           The earliest patent publication known by Applicant to disclose the chemical
structure of ponatinib hydrochloride is WO 2007/075869, which is also owned by Applicant
(ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and is hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.
Example 16 of WO 2007/075859 states that the product was obtained as a solid: 533 m/z
(M+H), This mass corresponds to the free base of ponatinib. Example 16 also discusses the
preparation of a mono hydrochloride salt of ponatinib. Example 16 neither specifically mentions
that the ponatinib hydrochloride obtained was crystalline nor specifies any particular crystalline
forms of ponatinib hydrochloride.

 [0008]          United States Serial No. 11/644,849, which published as US 2007/0191376, is a
 counterpart application to WO 2007/075869 and granted on February 14, 2012 as U.S. Patent
 No. 8,114,874, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. United States
 Serial No. 13/357,745 is a continuing application of USSN 11/644,849, which also is hereby
 incorporated herein by reference for all purposes,
 {0009]          Additional patent applications owned         by Applicant that cover ponatinib
 hydrochloride and published as of the filing date of this application include WO 2011/053938
 and WO 2012/139027, both of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference for all
purposes. Like WO 2007/075869, neither of WO 2011/053938 or WO 2012/139027 specifies
any particular crystalline forms of ponatinib hydrochloride.
                                             SUMMARY
[0010]           It has now been discovered that ponatinib hydrochloride can exist in certain
crystalline forms, certain of which are suitable for tablet development.

administering to the human a therapeutically effective amount of a substantially pure crystalline
form of ponatinib hydrochloride disclosed herein.         In certain embodiments, the disorder or
condition is chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) when the protein kinase is Bcr-Abl or a mutant form thefeof.

                                                   9

 [0062]           It was surprisingly discovered that 3-(imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-3-yiethynyl)-4
 methyl-N-{4-[(4-methylpiperazin-1 -yl)methyl}-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl}benzamide             mono
 hydrochloride can be obtained in various solid state crystalline forms.       "Crystalline form" or
 "polymorphic form" or "polymorph", as these terms may be used interchangeably herein, refers
to a crystalline form of ponatinib hydrochloride that is distinct from the amorphous form of
 ponatinib hydrochloride and other crystalline form(s) of ponatinib hydrochloride as determined
 by certain physical properties such thermodynamic stability, physical parameters, x-ray
 structure, DSC and preparation processes. While polymorphism classically refers to the ability
of a compound to crystallize into more than one distinct crystal species (having identical
chemical      structure   but   quite     different    physicochemical    properties),    the   term
pseudopolymorphism is typically applied to solvate and hydrate crystalline forms. For purposes
of this disclosure, however, both true polymorphs as well as pseudopolymorphs, i.e., hydrate
and solvate forms, are included in the scope of the term "crystalline forms" and "polymorphic
forms."    In addition, "amorphous" refers to a disordered solid state. It should be noted that
different samples of a particular crystalline form will share the same major XRPD peaks, but that
there can be variation in powder patterns with regard to minor peaks. In addition, the term
"about" with regard to XRPD maxima values (in degrees two theta) generally means within 0.3
degrees two theta, of the given value; alternatively, the term "about" means (in this and all
contexts) within an accepted standard of error of the mean, when considered by one of ordinary
skill in the art. As used herein, the terms "isolated" and "substantially pure" mean more than
50% of the crystalline ponatinib hydrochloride is present (as can be determined by a method in
accordance with the art) in the identified crystalline form relative to the sum of other solid
form(s) present in the selected material,

  [0063]         Through XRPD analysis, a total of eleven polymorphic forms of ponatinib
  hydrochloride were discovered. Each of the eleven new polymorphic forms are referred to
  herein as: HCI1 (also referred to herein as "Form A"), HC12 (also referred to herein as "Form B"),
  HCl2b (also referred to herein as "Form C"), HCJ3-class (also referred to herein as "Form D"), a
  mixture HCI1+HCI4 (also referred to herein as "Form E"), HCIS-class or simply HCI5 (also
  referred to herein as "Form F"), HC15b or HCI desolvate (also referred to herein as "Form G"),
  HC16-class (also referred to herein as "Form H"), HC16 desolvate (also referred to herein as
  "Form I"), HCI7 (also referred to herein as "Form J"), and HC18 (also referred to herein as "Form
  K"). The nature or origin of these eleven polymorphic forms is indicated in Figure 1. In addition,
  certain characteristics of the referenced polymorphic form are provided as well. For instance,
                                                    11

 Form A is indicated as being an anhydrate of ponatinib hydrochloride and additionally was
 obtained as a single crystal.
 (0064)          In general, crystalline forms of ponatinib hydrochloride have physical properties
 (such as high stability, etc.) that are advantageous for the commercial preparation of solid
dosage forms as compared to amorphous ponatinib hydrochloride. The distinction between
crystalline ponatinib hydrochloride and amorphous ponatinib hydrochloride can be readily seen
with the same type of physical chemical data (e.g., DSC, XRPD, thermal analysis) that is used
to distinguish the individual crystalline forms of ponatinib hydrochloride disclosed herein.
[0065]           With reference to the foregoing methodologies, attention is now drawn to each of
the     discovered    polymorphs      of   3-(imidazo[1,2-blpyridazin-3-ylethynyl)-4-methyl-N-{4-[(4
methylpiperazin- 1-yl)methyl]-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl}benzamide mono hydrochloride.
[0066]          Characteristics of Form A (HCII):
[0067]          The anhydrate HCI1 (same crystalline form as the starting material) was the
predominant crystalline form discovered. The chemical structure of ponatinib hydrochloride has
been unambiguously established by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(NMR), mass spectrometry (MS), and single crystal X-ray crystallography with confirmatory data
from elemental and chloride analysis, Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and
ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy.       The preferred solid form of ponatinib hydrochloride is the
anhydrous crystalline HCI-1 solid form or Form A.
(0068]          With reference to Figure 3, samples of Ponatinib HCI, ASI Batch 110020 and
CGAM Batch F08-06057 were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). In each case, the
material was analyzed prior to and after DVS humidity cycling. XRPD patterns were obtained
using a high-throughput XRPD diffractometer,            Data collection was carried out at room
temperature using monochromatic CuKa radiation in the 20 region between 1.5* and 41.5,
which is the most distinctive part of the XRPD pattern. The diffraction pattern of each well was
collected in two 26 ranges (1.5" s 29 s 21.5 for the first frame, and 19.5" s 26 5 41.5" for the
second) with an exposure time of 90 seconds for each frame. No background subtraction or
curve smoothing was applied to the XRPD patterns.               Figure 3 shows the X-ray powder
diffraction pattern of these materials, each in the HCI-1 solid form. This powder pattern is
consistent with the powder pattern simulated from single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments on
the HCI-1 form.     XRPD data acquired prior to, and after DVS humidity cycling experiments,
                                                   12

 indicates that the HC!-1 solid form is maintained after humidity cycling. In the XRPD pattern of
 Form A shown in Figure 3, at least one or all of the following peaks in degress two theta (20) is
 shown: 5.9; 7.1; 10.0; 12.5; 16.4; 19.3; 21.8; 23.8; and 26.1. In certain embodiments, the XRPD
 pattern of Form A shows two peaks, three peaks, four peaks or five peaks. The term "about"
 applies to each listed peak for this and all other forms mentioned in this disclosure.
 [0069]          Figure 4 shows a characteristic X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) pattern for
 Form A of ponatinib hydrochloride in which greater detail relative to the XRPD is seen, The
 XRPD pattern of Form A shown in Figure 4 shows at least one or more of the following peaks in
 degress two theta (2e): 5.9; 7.1; 10.0; 12.5; 13.6; 14.1; 15.0; 16.4; 17.7; 18.6; 19.3; 20.4; 21.8;
22.3; 23.8; 24.9; 26.1; 27.0; 28.4; 30.3; 31.7; and 35.1.      In certain embodiments, the XRPD
 pattern of Form A shows two peaks, three peaks, four peaks or five peaks.
 [0070]          In differential vapor sorption (DVS) experiment with HCI-1, the relatve humidity
was cycled from 45% to 95% (sorption), to 0% (desorption) and back to 45% (sorption) at a
 constant temperature of 25"C, with a hold time of 60 minutes per step. The results of this DVS
experiment on ponatinib HCI CGAM Batch FOB-060507 exhibited a 1,1% water uptake at 95%
humidity, and ponatinib HCI ASI Batch 110020 exhibited a 1.4% water uptake at a relative
humidity of 95%. This water uptake was reversible on cycling to lower humidity. These results
demonstrate that HCI-1 is not a hygroscopic compound. The effect of the humidity cycling on
HCI-1 was also assessed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis before and after the DVS
experiment. The XRPD data revealed that humidity cycling had no effect on the solid form of
the material, which remained in the HCI-1 solid form.
[0071]          With reference to Figure 5, the melting point of ponatinib HCI in the HCI-1 solid
form, was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The sample of ponatinib HCI,
ASI Batch 110020, was analyzed in a pin-holed crucible in the temperature range of 25"C to
300"C at a heating rate of 10C per minute using dry N2 gas purge. An intense endothermic
event with a peak of 264,10C was observed, corresponding to the melting point of Form A.
[0072)          With     reference   to  Figure    6, Thermogravimetric      analysis   (TGA)   and
thermogravimetric analysis with mass spectroscopic analysis of volatiles (TGMS) was
performed on ponatinib HCI, ASI Batch 110020. The sample, contained in a pin-holed crucible,
was heated in the TGA instrument from 25"C to 300*C at a heating rate of 10"C min-1, with dry
N2  gas used for purging. Gases evolved from the TGA were analyzed using a quadrupole mass
spectrometer,     Ponatinib HCI, ASI Batch 110020, in the HCI-1 solid form, contained 0.31%
water by weight and 0.85% ethanol by weight at the time of release.The TGA/TGMS experiment
                                                  13

indicated that mass losses of 0.2% (water) and 0.6% (ethanol, from the crystallization solvent)
are observed between the temperature range of 25-130*C and 130 - 240"C, respectively.
These losses are consistent with the water and ethanol content at the time of release. Ethanol
is released from the material at a higher temperature than water, although not associated with
ponatinib HCI in the HCI-1 solid form as a solvate.
(0073]          Extensive solution phase NMR studies using a combination of multiple 1D and
2D NMR methods were performed on Form A of ponatinib HCI to obtain a complete assignment
of 1H, 19F, and  13
                   C resonances, and hence to confirm the chemical structure of ponatinib HCL.
Analyses were performed at ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, on a sample of
ponatinib HC (ASI Batch 110020) dissolved in deuterated DMSO (DMSO-ds) solvent. NMR
spectra were acquired at a temperature of 300 K on a Bruker Avance Ill-600 MHz NMR
spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm BBFO z-gradient probe. All 1H chemical shifts were
referenced to the DMSO peak at 2.5 ppm. With reference to Figure 7, the 1D 1H-NMR spectra
of Form A of ponatinib HCI in DMSO-d 6 is shown. 'H resonance 32a arises from the protonated
piperazine moiety in ponatinib HCI. The EtOH resonances appearing in both 1H (Figure 7) and
13C spectra (Figure 9) arise from residual EtOH present in ponatinib HCI, Figure 8 shows the
1D "F-NMR spectra of Form A of ponatinib HCI in DMSO-d 6 with a characteristic chemical shift
at 57.94 ppm. Figure 9 shows the 1 D "C-NMR spectra of Form A of ponatinib HCI in DMSO-d.

 pump. The accurate mass for ponatinib HCI was obtained on the Exactive mass spectrometer
 using full scan mode. The mass observed in this infusion experiment is m/z 533.2269 (MH+)
 with the calculated exact mass being 533.2271 (MH+) yielding a mass difference of 0.2 mmu (A
 ppm of -0.38) (Figure 10 top). The fragmentation spectrum of ponatinib HCI on the Exactive
 mass spectrometer is shown in Figure 10, and contains the product ions from m/z of 533.2269
 (the molecular ion of ponatinib HCI), as well as ions from any other co-eluted compounds.
 [0076]          Figure 11 shows MS fragmentation data obtained on the LTQ XL ion trap mass
 spectrometer. Figure 11(A) shows the full scan MS of m/z 533, (MH*) of the sample during
 infusion. Figure 11(B) (MS2 scan) shows the fragment spectrum of the selected mass m/z 533.
 Figure 11(C) and Figure 11(D) show the product ions from m/z 433 and 260 respectively; ions
 m/z 433, and 260 were themselves the initial product ions from m/z 533 (the molecular ion).
 [0077]         Single-crystal X-Ray diffraction analysis was employed to determine the crystal
 structure of the Form A of ponatinib hydrochloride. Single crystals of ponatinib HCI, in the
 anhydrate HCI-1 form were obtained using the vapor diffusion into liquid crystallization method
 using ponatinib HCI CGAM Batch FaB-06057. A single crystal obtained using methanol as a
solvent with ethyl acetate as anti-solvent was analyzed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. From
 prior experiments, it was known that crystals of this form diffracted well, leading to the solution
of the structure of ponatinib HCI shown in Figure 12, with crystallographic parameters
summarized in Table 2, The terminal nitrogen of the piperazine is the site of protonation in
ponatinib HCl, consistent with the previously described NMR analysis of ponatinib HCI. The
chloride counter-ion occurs in the crystal structure immediately adjacent to the site of
protonation. Based on this structure analysis, it was determined that Form A is an anhydrated
form.

 [0079]          In the FT-IR, the functional group region extends from 4000 to 1300 cm-1. In the
 region from 3300 to 2800 cm-1 (region A), there are multiple overlapping, absorption bands
 arising from stretching vibrations between hydrogen and some other atom, likely amide N-H
 stretching, aromatic C-H stretching (from the imidazo-pyridazine heterocycle and phenyl groups)
 and aliphatic C-H stretching (in methyl and methylene groups), all present in the structure of
 ponatinib HCI.    A weak band in the 2100-2260cm-1 (region B) is due to triple C-C bond
 stretching, A medium intensity band due to amide C=O stretching (Amide 1) can be expected in
 1640-1690 cm-1 range, likely the band observed at 1669.8 cm-1(region C). Secondary amide
 N-H bending gives absorption bands in the 1500-1560cm-1 range (Amide 2), where two strong
 bands are observed (region D). Multiple weak to medium bands observed in the 1300-1600 cm
 1 range are due to (hetero)aromatic resonance-stabilized double C-C and double C-N bonds
 (ring stretching vibrations), and C-H bending vibrations (from methyl and methylene groups)
 (region E), Aromatic and aliphatic amine C-N stretching bands can be expected in the 1250
 1335cm-1 range and in the 1250-1020cm-1 range, respectively, where multiple bands are
observed, including a particularly strong band at 1314.9 cm-1 (regions F, G). The fingerprint
 region, 1300 to 910 cm-1, is complex with a strong, broad band at 1122.6 cm-1 (region H), likely
due to C-F stretching. The aromatic region, 910 to 650 cm-1, absorption bands are primarily
due to the out-of-plane bending of hetero-aromatic ring C-H bonds indicating the hetero
aromatic nature of the compound (region 1). These data in the FT-IR spectrum support the
proposed structure of Form A of ponatinib hydrochloride.
[0080]           Experiments to determine the purity of Form A were carried out. With reference
to Figure 14, it was determined that the purity of Form A of ponatinib hydrochloride is 99.8160 %
(area percent).
{0081]           Characteristics of Form B {HC[2):
[0082]           Form HCI2 was obtained from a solubility assessment in TFElwater and it was
converted to form HCl2b one day after storage of the measuring plate at ambient conditions, as
confirmed by the XRPD re-measurement of the specific sample. HCl2 was also obtained in the
experiments performed in Phase 2 described herein from aqueous solvent systems (water and
MeOH/water) and it also converted to form HCl2b upon storage at ambient conditions (see
overview in Figure 2).
[0083]           Form B was analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). Figure 15 shows
XRPD patterns of (from bottom to top): starting material (Form A), Form HCI2 (QSA121,
                                                  19

 solvent: water) and Form HCI2b (QSA12.2, remeasurement after few days at ambient
conditions).    In the XRPD pattern of Form B shown in Figure 15, at least one or all of the
following peaks in degress two theta (28) is shown: 3.1; 6.5: 12.4; 13.8; 15.4: 16.2; 17.4 18.0;
20.4; 23.2; 24.4; 26.1; and 26.9. For reference, in the XRPD pattern of Form C shown in Figure
 15, at least one or all of the following peaks in degress two theta (20) is shown: 6.5; 12.4; 13.8;
 17.4; 18.0; 20.6; 22.0; 23.0; 25,5; 26.5; and 27.4. In these embodiments, the XRPD pattern of
Form B and C shows two peaks, three peaks, four peaks or five peaks.
[0084]           Experiments to determine the purity of Form B were carried out. With reference
to Figure 15, it was determined that the purity of Form B of ponatinib hydrochloride is 99.7535 %
(area percent).
[0085]           Characteristics of Form C (HCI2b):
100861           Form B is a hydrated form. Form HCl2b was initially obtained from the solubility
assessment experiments, either by conversion of Form B, over a number of days under ambient
conditions or directly from TFE/water solvent mixtures, Form C was also obtained in the Phase
2 experiments from aqueous solvent systems (water and water/DMSO) (see overview in Figure
2).
[0087]           Form C was analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD).          Figure 17 shows
XRPD patterns of (from bottom to top): starting material (HC11) and Form HCl2b (QSA21.1,
solvent: water). In the XRPD pattern of Form C shown in Figure 17, at least one or all of the
following peaks in degress two theta (29) is shown: 3.1; 6,5; 12.4; 13.8; 17.4; 18.D; 20.6 22.0;
23.0; 25.5; 26.5; 27.4; 28,4; and 29.0. In certain embodiments, the XRPD pattern of Form C
shows two peaks, three peaks, four peaks or five peaks.
[0088]           With reference to Figure 18, the melting point of Form C of ponatinib HCI was
determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The sample of was analyzed in a pin
holed crucible in the temperature range of 25"C to 300*C at a heating rate of 10"C per minute
using dry N2 gas purge.         Intense endothermic events occurred at Tp88k = 122.9"C, TpEak
=158.2"C and Tpe.k =256.2"C.
[0089]           Figure 19 shows TGA and SDTGA thermograms of QSA21.1. Figure 20 shows a
TGMS thermogram of Form C from experiment QSA21.1.               A mass loss of 4,3% (water) is
observed in the temperature interval 40"C-140"C. The APJ:water ratio was assessed as 1:1.4.
[0090]           Experiments to determine the purity of Form C were carried out. With reference
                                                  20

 to Figure 21, it was determined that the purity of Form C of ponatinib hydrochloride is 99.7850
 % (area percent).
 [0091]          Characteristics of Form D (HCI3-class):
 [0092]          HCI3-class was mostly obtained from aromatic solvents, as can be seen in the
 overview in Figure 2, with the exception of the MeOH/acetonitrile mixture. Form D was
 successfully reproduced at the 120 mg scale using cooling-evaporative crystallization in toluene.
 [0093]          Based on the thermal analyses, the sample representative of the Form D was
 assigned as    a toluene solvated form (API:toluene 1:0.5). The form desolvated at 199.5"C,
 recrystallized and a second melting was observed at 257.6*C (most likely corresponding to the
 melting point  of Form A), HCI3-class is mildly hygroscopic, with 2.5% water mass uptake at
95% RH. The process was reversible regarding to physical stability and sample appearance.
 [0094]          HC3-class sample was found to be physically stable after 8 months storage
under ambient conditions and following the DVS cycle. However, HC!3-class sample converted
to HCl1 after 1 week in the humidity chamber (40"C/75% RH).
[0095]           Form D was analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). Figure 22 shows
XRPD patterns of a XRPD overlay of (from bottom to top): HCI1 (AP24534 HC salt starting
material), HCl3-class (PSM17, solvent: toluene), HC13 (PSM1, solvent toluene), HC11+HCl3
(PSM1 after one week at 40OC/75% RH) and HC3 (PSM1 after DVS). In the XRPD pattern
shown in Figure 22, at least one of all of the following peaks in degress two theta (20) is shown
for HCI3: 8.2; 10.1; 10.9; 14.9; 16.0; 16.3; 16.8; 17.7; 18,7; 20.2; 22.9; 24.0; 25.6; 26.7; and
28.5. In the XRPD pattern shown in Figure 22, at least one or all of the following peaks in
degress two theta (29) is shown for HCl3+HC11: 6.5; 7.4; 12.5; 13.6: 14.1: 16.7: 17.4 18.0; 19.3;
20.4 21.8; 24.0; 25.1; 26.3; and 28.0. In certain embodiments, the XRPD pattern of Form D
shows two peaks, three peaks, four peaks or five peaks.
[0096]          With reference to Figure 23, the melting point of Form D of ponatinib HCI (PSM1)
was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The sample of was analyzed in a
pin-holed crucible in the temperature range of 250C to 300"C at a heating rate of 100C per
minute using dry N2 gas purge. Intense endothermic events occurred at Tpeak = 199r5"C, Tpea=k
204.1"C and Tpea = 257.6*C.
[0097]          With reference to Figure 24, TGA and SDTGA thermograms of Form D (PSM1)
are provided. A mass loss of 7.7% (toluene, ratio API:Solvent is 1:0.51) was observed in the
                                                 21

 temperature interval 120"C-220 0 C.
 [0098]           With reference to Figure 25, a FT-IR spectrum of the region of 1750 - 500 cm-1 is
 shown. These data support the proposed structure of Form D of ponatinib hydrochloride. In
 addition, this spectrum show the unique identity of Form D relative to Form A.
 {0099]           Experiments to determine the purity of Form D (PSM1) were carried out. With
 reference to Figure 26, it was determined that the purity of Form D of ponatinib hydrochloride is
 97.3664 % (area percent).
 100100]         Characteristics of Form E (mixture of HC14+HC1):
 [00101)         HCI4 was only obtained as a mixture with Form A from a grinding experiment
 with hexafluorobenzene (see overview in Figure 2).
 [00102]         Form E of ponatinib hydrochloride was found not to be physically stable upon
 storage at ambient conditions. The mixture HCI1+HCI4 was re-measured by XRPD after 8
 months of storage and it had converted to Form A.
 [00103]         Characteristics of Form F (HC15-class):
 [00104]         Form HC15 was obtained from one vapor diffusion onto solids experiment
described here in butyl acetate (see overview in Figure 2). HCl5-class was characterized by
 DSC, cycling-DSC, TGMS, FTR, HPLC and DVS. The physical stability undef short-term
 storage conditions (i.e. one week at 400 C and 75% RH) was investigated. HCl5-class samples
were physically stable, as assessed by XRPD, after B months storage under ambient conditions.
After 1 week in the humidity chamber (40'C/75% RH), the material was still HCI5-class,
however with a slightly different XRPD pattern.
[001051          A DVS experiment showed that HC15-class is highly hygroscopic, with a 37%
water mass adsorption. The material lost its crystallinity as indicated by the XRPD following the
DVS experiment.
[00106]          Form F was successfully scaled up at the 120 mg scale using the same
conditions as those of the original experiment to identify the previously discovered polymorphs.
Two scale-up experiments were performed and the corresponding XRPD patterns indicated
forms isostructural to HC15. These isostructural forms together with HC15 and HCl5b were
designated HC15-class or Form F. Figure 27 shows XRPD patterns of a XRPD overlay of (from
                                                  22

 bottom to top): HC11 (Form A starting material); HC15 and HCl5b (VDS28 wet and dry, solvent:
 butyl acetate); HC15-class (VDS1, solvent: butyl acetate), Low crystalline (VDS1 after DVS);
 HCl5-class (VDS2, solvent: butyl acetate); and HC15-class (VDS2 after one week at 40*, 75%
 RH).   In the XRPD pattern shown in Figure 27, at least one or all of the following peaks in
degress two theta (26) is shown for HC15: 6.8; 9.8; 12.4; 16.2; 17.9; 19.0; 24.0; and 25.1, In the
XRPD pattern shown in Figure 27, at least one or all of the following peaks in degress two theta
(26) is shown for HCI5-class (top pattern): 7.9: 8.7; 9.7; 11.4; 15.6; 16.5; and 25.8. In certain
embodiments, the XRPD pattern of Form F shows two peaks, three peaks, four peaks or five
peaks.
[00107]         With reference to Figure 28, the melting point of Form F of ponatinib HCI (PSM1)
was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).           Samples from two different
experiments were analyzed in a pin-holed crucible in the temperature range of 25"C to 300"C at
a heating rate of 10"C per minute using dry N2 gas purge. A sample from one experiment
(VDS1, top curve) evidenced intense endothermic events occurred at Tpea = 120.7"C, Tp68 =
184.3"C and Tpe2 = 209.4"C.        A sample from another experiment (VDS2, bottom curve)
evidenced intense endothermic events occurred at     Tpe, =  122,1"C, Tpeak = 209.7"C and   Tpeak =
252.1"C.
(00108]         A cycling DSC experiment showed that upon desolvation, HCl5-class converted
to a form designated "HCI5-desolvate", which melted at circa 210*C.
[00109]         With reference to Figure 29, a TGA/SDTA thermogram of Form F (VDS1 top)
and TGMS (bottom) thermogram are provided. A mass loss of 17.1% (Butyl acetate, ratio
APL:Solvent 1:1.01) was observed in the temperature interval 25"C-1600 C. TG-MS analyses
showed that HC15-class is a butyl acetate solvate with a ratio API:butyl acetate of 1:1 and it
desolvates at around 120"C. Figure 30 provides a corresponding TGA/SDTA (top) and TGMS
(bottom) thermogram of Form F for VDS2. A mass loss of 16.6% (Butyr acetate, ratio
APl:Solvent 1:0.98) was observed in the temperature interval 25"C-160*C.
[00110]         With reference to Figures 31 and 32, a FT-IR spectrum of the region of 1750
500 cm 1 is shown.       These data support the proposed structure of Form F of ponatinib
hydrochloride. In addition, these spectra show the unique identity of Form F relative to Form A.
[00111]         Experiments to determine the purity of Form F (VDS2) were carried out. With
reference to Figure 33, it was determined that the purity of Form D of ponatinib hydrochloride is
98.2533 % (area percent).

 [00112]         Characteristics of Form G (HCI5b):
 [00113]         Form G or ponatinib hydrochloride was obtained by conversion of HC5, upon
 drying for 3 days under full vacuum. HC15b form was found to be physically stable after 8
 months storage under ambient conditions.
 [00114]         Characterization data for Form G is provided herein in the context of Form F.
 [00115]         Characteristics of Form H (HC16-class):
 [00116]         HC16 was obtained from two experiments; vapor into solution and vapor onto
 solids, in MeOH/water and MeOH solvent systems, respectively (see overview in Figure 2).
Different time points of material sampling showed that the corresponding XRPD patterns were
slightly different, without being bound by theory, indicating that HC16 is a class of forms, likely
isostructural. HC16-class was successfully scaled up to 120 mg using the same conditions as
those of the MeOH vapor onto solids experiment of the original screening experiment.
[00117]          HC16-class was characterized by DSC, cycling-DSC, TGMS, FTIR, HPLC and
DVS. The physical stability under short-term storage conditions (i.e. one week at 40'C and 75%
RH) was investigated. Form H samples were physically stable, as assessed by XRPD, after 8
months storage under ambient conditions. After 1 week in the humidity chamber (40"C/75%
RH), the material was still HC16-class, however with a slightly different XRPD.
[00118]          Figure 34 shows XRPD patterns of a XRPD overlay of (from bottom to top): Form
A (ponatinib hydrochloride starting material), HC16-class (VDS6, solvent: methanol), HCI6-class
(VDS3, solvent: methanol), HC16 (VDS3 after DVS), HCIG-class (VDS3 after climate chamber),
HC16-class (VDS4, solvent: methanol) and HC16-class (VDS4 after DVS). In the XRPD pattern
shown in Figure 34, at least one or all of the following peaks in degress two theta (20) is shown
for HC16 (immediately above Form A pattern): 5.9; 8.1; 9.5; 10.7; 13.4; 16.0; 17.0; 22.0; 22.8;
24.7; and 28.3. In the XRPD pattern shown in Figure 34, at least one or all of the following
peaks in degress two theta (20) is shown for HC16-class (top pattern): 8.0; 10.2; 10.9: 11.8;
14.1; 15.4; 16.3; 19.9; 22.3; 23.7; 25.0; and 28.2. In certain embodiments, the XRPD pattern of
Form F shows two peaks, three peaks, four peaks or five peaks. Although XRPD analysis of
both samples showed that similar patterns were observed after the DVS run, the TGMS analysis
of VDS4 showed that methanol molecules were no longer present in the sample but they had
been replaced by water molecules (forming presumably a hemi-hydrated form belonging to the
HC16-class.

[00119]         With reference to Figure 35, the melting point of Form H of ponatinib HCI was
determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Samples from two different experiments
were analyzed in a pin-holed crucible in the temperature range of 25"C to 300"C at a heating
rate of 10 0C per minute using dry N2 gas purge. A sample from one experiment (VDS3, top
curve) evidenced an intense endothermic event at      Tpk   = 219.4"C.   A sample from another
experiment (VDS4, bottom curve) evidenced intense endothermic events occurred at           Tpa  =
219.4*C and Tpk = 256.8"C,
[00120]         With reference to Figure 36, a TGA/SDTA thermogram of Form H (VDS3, top)
and TGMS (VDS3, bottom) thermogram are provided. A mass loss of 5.4% (Methanol, ratio
API:Solvent 1:1,01) was observed in the temperature interval 30"C -150*C and a mass loss of
0.3% (Methanol ratio APL:Solvent 1:0.05) was observed in the temperature interval 190*C
220"C.    A corresponding TGA/SDTA thermogram of Form H (top) and TGMS (bottom)
thermogram is shown at Figure 37 for VDS4, A mass loss of 3.3% (Methanol, ratio API:Solvent
1:0.6) was observed in the temperature interval 30"C-150"C and a mass loss of 07%
(Methanol, ratio AP1:Solvent 1:0.12) was observed in the temperature interval 190"C-220"C.
[00121]         With reference to Figures 38 and 39, a FT-IR spectrum of the region of 1750
500 crn" is shown.       These data support the proposed structure of Form H of ponatinib
hydrochloride, In addition, these spectra show the unique identity of Form H relative to Form A.
[00122]         Experiments to determine the purity of Form H (VDS4) were carried out. With
reference to Figure 40, it was determined that the purity of Form H of ponatinib hydrochloride is
97.9794 % (area percent).
[00123]         Characteristics of Form I (HCI6 desolvate):
[00124]         A cycling DSC experiment conducted in connection with the experiments for
Form H showed that upon desolvation, HC16-class converted to a form designated "HCl6
desolvate", which melted at circa 220"C.
[00125]         Characteristics of Form J (HC17):
[00126]         Form J is a pentahydrate of ponatinib HCI and was discovered in the context of a
single crystal analysis. Form J is the most stable hydrated structure identified, as competitive
                                               25

 slurries in water between the trihydrate and pentahydrate showed.
 {00127]         Single crystals of suitable size were obtained in the vapor diffusion experiment
 performed with the solvent mixture methanol/water 20:80 and n-butyl acetate as anti-solvent
 (experiment ID 46). One parallelepiped single crystal of approximate size 0.45 x 0.25 x 0.12 mm
was collected from the crystallization vial and mounted on a glass fiber. The crystallographic
data (collected up to 6 = 27.5*) are listed in Table 4.

chloride anion and two neutral entities: the trifluoroethanol and the water molecules, In this
structure, although water molecules are involved in the H-bonding they do not separate the
charged atoms (contrary to the pentahydrated and trihydrated forms. The TFE and water
molecules acted only as donors in the hydrogen bonding network. In particular for the water
molecules, only one of the hydrogen atoms acts as donor, which could be responsible for the
disorder of the water molecules and the fact that the ratio of the water molecules compared to
the API molecules is not stoichiometric.

[00136]          Figure 45 shows XRPD patterns of Form A of ponatinib hydrochloride (bottom
pattern) and amorphous ponatinib hydrochloride (top pattern) (solvent:2,2,2-trifluroethanol). $tis
readily apparent that Form A has a distinct set of peaks at particular angles two theta whereas
the amorphous ponatinib hydrochloride does not have any defined peaks.

as compared to Form A of amorphous ponatinib hydrochloride.                 Figure 46 shows a
characteristic Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) thermogram of amorphous ponafinib
hydrochloride. An intense endothermic event with a peak of 259.4*C was observed,
corresponding to the melting point of the amorphous form. This melting point is distinct from

(00138)          Unique and distinct physical properties of amorphous ponalinib hydrochloride
and Form A of ponatinib hydrochloride do not seem to be attributed to purity of the respective
                                                2B

materials. In the case of amorphous ponatinib hydrochloride, the material was determined by
HPLC to have a purity of 99.7877% (area percent) (see Figure 47), whereas the purity of Form
A of ponatinib hydrochloride was determined to be 99.8% (area percent).

                              DISCOVERY OF POLYMORPHIC FORMS
[00139]         initial efforts to discover polymorphic forms of ponatinib hydrochloride were
divided into two phases. Phase I included starting-material characterization, feasibility testing
and solubility study to provide data for the solvent selection for Phase 2. Phase 2 included 192
polymorph screening experiments at milliliter (ml) scale. These initial efforts led to the discovery
of eight polymorphic forms, Form A, Form B, Form C, Form D, Form E, Form F, Form G and
Form H.
[00140]         Phase 1: Starting Material Characterization
[00141]         Approximately 24 grams of the compound ponatinib hydrochloride was provided
as a light yellow solid. This starting material was characterized by XRPD, digital imaging, DSC,
TGMS and HPLC. The starting material, 3-(imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-3-ylethynyl)-4-methyl-N-{4
[(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]-3-(trifiuoromethyl)phenyl}benzamide        mono hydrochloride, is
provided as a crystalline material (designated HCI1) and its chemical purity was assessed by
HPLC as 99.8%. TGA and TGMS analyses showed 0.7% of mass loss (residual ethanol) in the
temperature interval 250C-240 0 C prior to the thermal decomposition process. DSC analysis
showed an endothermic event with Tp06 k = 264.8'C, probably related to melting and/or
decomposition of the compound, 3-(imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-3-ylethynyl)-4-methyl-N-{4-[(4
methylpiperazi n-1 -yl)methyl]-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl}benzamide mono hydrochloride.
[00142]         Phase 1: Solubility Study
[00143]         Quantitative solubility testing was performed on ponatinib hydrochloride starting
material, employing a set of 20 solvents. Slurries were prepared with an equilibration time of 24
hours after which the slurries were filtrated. The solubility was determined from the saturated
solutions by HPLC. The residual solids were characterized by XRPD. The results are
summarized in Table 6.

  Amorphous
[00144]              In 19 of the experiments shown in Table 6, the materials analyzed following the
solubility assessments in 19 different solvents appeared to be the same form as the starting
material designated form HC11.                 In the experiment QSA13 performed in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol.
the material dissolved completely at the selected concentration and the sample obtained after
evaporation of the solvent resulted in amorphous material. The solids from two slurries in water
(QSA12 and QSA21) resulted in two different forms, Form HC12 and Form HCl2b, respectively.
After few days stored at ambient conditions, the form HCl2 converted to Form HCI2b and it
                                                                  30

 could therefore not be further characterized. Upon further characterization, the Form HCl2b was
 determined to be a hydrated form (ratio API/water 1:1.4).
 [00145]           Phase 1: Feasibility Study
 [00146]           Feasibility tests were performed to attempt to obtain amorphous starting material
 that could be employed in some crystallization techniques of the Phase 2 portion of the study,
 Two techniques were employed i.e. grinding and freeze-drying. The results are presented
 below.
 [00147]          Grinding. Two grinding experiments were performed with two different durations
 at a frequency of 30Hz. After 60 minutes of grinding, the crystalline starting material converted
to amorphous. After 120 min, the resulting material remained amorphous with a chemical purity
 of 99.6%.
 [00148}          Freeze-drying.             Eight freeze-drying experiments were performed with 3
 (imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-3-ylethynyl)-4-methyl-N-{4-[(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methy]-3
 (trifluoromethyl)phenyl}benzamide mono hydrochloride. These experiments are summarized in
Table 7.

  Based ontheTGMS results, 2Chemical purity determined by HPLC.
[00149]           The solubility of compound ponatinib hydrochloride in tetrahydrofuran, 2
methyltetrahydrofuran and dichloromethane was too low to apply the freeze drying procedure in
good conditions. With solvents such as methanol, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) and TFE/water
                                                                31

 mixtures, amorphous material was obtained. In the samples obtained from neat TFE or with
 high TFE content in the solvent mixtures, 11% of residual solvent was detected in the dried
 powders (according to the TGMS results). The samples obtained from methanol and TFE/water
 50:50 contained less residual solvent only 0.9% and 1.5%, respectively, The amount of residual
solvent in the amorphous material produced from TFE/water 50:50 could be reduced to below
 1% after extra drying for 24 hours. For both amorphous samples obtained from methanol and
TFE/water 50:50, the chemical purity was assessed to be 99.8% by HPLC. Because creeping
was observed in the freeze-drying experiment with methanol, the procedure using TFE/waier
50:50 was selected to be used to produce the amorphous ponatinib hydrochloride to be used in
the cooling-evaporation crystallizations and vapor diffusion onto solids experiments of Phase 2.
{00150]          Phase 2: Polymorph Discovery
[00151]          The polymorph screening experiments for ponatinib hydrochloride were carried
out at milliliter (ml) scale using 192 different conditions in which six different crystallization
procedures were applied: (1) cooling-evaporation; (2) anti-solvent addition; (3) grinding; (4)
slurry; (5) vapor diffusion into solutions; and (6) vapor diffusion onto solids. After the screening
experiments were completed, the materials were collected and analyzed by XRPD and digital
imaging.
[00152]          Cooling-Evaporative Crystallization Experiments.      The 36 cooling-evaporalive
experiments shown at Table 8 at ml scale were performed in 1,8 mi vials, employing 36 different
solvents and solvent mixtures and 1 concentration. In each vial, 25 mg of amorphous ponatinib
hydrochloride was weighed. Then the screening solvent was added to reach a concentration of
circa 60 mg/ml. The vials, also containing a magnetic stirring bar, were closed and placed in an
Avantium Crystal16 to undergo a temperature profile as described in Table Y. The mixtures
were cooled to 5"C and held at that temperature for 48 hours before placing the vials under
vacuum. The solvents were evaporated for several days at 200 mbar or 10 mbar and analyzed
by XRPD and digital imaging.

[00153)          Crash-crystallization with anti-solvent addition Experiments.        For the crash
crystallization experiments. 36 different crystallization conditions were applied, using 1 solvent
and 24 different anti-solvents (see Table 9). The anti-solvent addition experiments have been
performed forwards. A stock solution was prepared, the concentration of ponatinib hydrochloride
being that attained at saturation at ambient temperature after equilibration for 24 hours before
filtering into 8 ml vials. To each of these vials a different anti-solvent was added, using a solvent
to anti-solvent ratio of 1:0.25. Because no precipitation occurred, this ratio was increased to 1:4
with a waiting time of 60 minutes between each addition. As no precipitation occurred yet, the
solvents were completely evaporated under vacuum at room temperature. After evaporation, the
experiments resulted to have no yield.

[00154]          Grinding Experiments. The drop-grinding technique uses a small amount of
solvent added to the material 3-(imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-3-ylethynyl)-4-methyl-N-{44(4
methylpiperazin-1 -yl)methyl}-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl}benzamide mono hydrochloride, which is
grinded in a stainless steel grinder jar with 2 stainless steel grinding balls. In this manner, the
effect of 24 different solvents (see Table 10) was investigated. Typically 30 mg of starting
material was weighed in the grinding container and 10 pl of solvent was added to the container.
The grinding experiments were performed at 30 Hz during 120 min. Each wet material was
subsequently analyzed by XRPD and digital imaging.

[00156]        Vapor Diffusion Into Solutions. For the vapour diffusion experiments, saturated
solutions of ponatinib hydrochloride were exposed to solvent vapours at room temperature for
two weeks. A volume of saturated solution was transferred to an 8 ml vial which was left open
and placed in a closed 40 ml vial with 2 ml of anti-solvent (see Table 12). After two weeks, the
samples were checked for solid formation. The samples were dried under vacuum (200 mbar or
10 mbar) and resulted to have no yield. Based on the results, additional experiments were
performed with 12 different crystallization conditions as described in the table, experiments ID
VDL25 - VDL36.

 [00158]         Analytical Methods Applicable for Phase I and Phase 2 Experiments
 [00159]         X-ray powder diffraction
 [00160}         Following the evaporation experiments, the products were harvested. XRPD
patterns were obtained using an Avantium T2 high-throughput XRPD set-up. The plates were
 mounted on a Bruker GADDS diffractometer equipped with a Hi-Star area detector. The XRPD
 platform was calibrated using Silver Behenate for the long d-spacings and Corundum for the
short d-spacings.
[001611          Data collection was carried out at room temperature using monochromatic CuK.
radiation in the 20 region between 1.5" and 41.5", which is the most distinctive part of the XRPD
pattern. The diffraction pattern of each well was collected in two 28 ranges (1.5 "< 20        21.5
for the first frame, and 19.5  0<  20   41.5 " for the second) with an exposure time of 90 seconds
for each frame. No background subtraction or curve smoothing was applied to the XRPD
patterns.    The carrier material used during XRPD analysis was transparent to X-rays and
contributed only slightly to the background.
[00162]          Thermal Analysis
[00163]          Melting properties were obtained from DSC thermograms, recorded with a heat
flux DSC822e instrument (Mettler-Toledo GmbH, Switzerland). The DSC822e was calibrated for
temperature and enthalpy with a small piece of indium (m.p. = 156.6"C; AHf = 28.45 J.g-).
Samples were sealed in standard 40 pl aluminum pans, pin-holed and heated in the DSC from
25"C to 300"C, at a heating rate of 10'C min-'         Dry N2 gas, at a flow rate of 50 ml min" was
used to purge the DSC equipment during measurement.
[00164]          Mass loss due to solvent or water loss from the crystals was determined by
TGA/SDTA. Monitoring the sample weight, during heating in a TGA/SDTA851e instrument
(Mettler-Toledo GmbH,        Switzerland), resulted in a weight vs. temperature curve. The
TGA/SDTAB51e was calibrated for temperature with indium and aluminum. Samples were
weighed into 100 pl aluminum crucibles and sealed. The seals were pin-holed and the crucibles
                                                   40

heated in the TGA from 25 to 300"C at a heating rate of 10*C min4. Dry N2 gas was used for
purging.
[00165]        The gases evolved from the TGA samples were analyzed by a mass
spectrometer Omnistar GSD 301 T2 (Pfeiffer Vacuum GmbH, Germany). The latter is a
quadrupole mass spectrometer which analyses masses in the range of 0-200 amu.
[00166]        Digital Imaging
[00167]        Digital images were automatically collected for all the wells of each weiI-plate,
employing a Philips PCVC 840K CCD camera controlled by Avantium Photoslider software.
[00168]        Press
[00169]       For the compression tests, an Atlas Power Press T25 (Specac) was used. The
Atlas Power T25 is a power assisted hydraulic press operating up to 25 Tons.

      The peak-area percentage of the compound of interest is employed as an indication of the purity
     of the component in the sample.
      [00172]         In the crystallization experiments during these initial efforts, XRPD analysis of the
      dry (and if applicable wet) samples obtained revealed the presence of seven additional
      polymorphic forms in addition to amorphous materials and the starting material, Form A. The
     seven forms are designated HC12, HCI2b, HCl3-class, HCI5, HCL5b, HC16-class and the
      mixture HC11+HC14.
      [00173]         The occurrence of the different forms obtained in Phase 2 of these initial efforts is
      presented in Figure 2. XRPD patterns and digital images representative of each form obtained
     in these Phase 2 experiments were obtained. The characterization of the forms obtained in
     Phase 1 of these initial efforts is summarized in Table 14.

" Occ: the total occurrence included 216 experiments carried out in Phase 2 for which 39 samples were analyzed additionally wel
or the mother liquor was evaporated and analyzed giving a total of 254 materials characterized. For example, "(3, 12%)"
correspond to 3 occurrences of the forni out of 254 measurements, giving a percemage of 1.2%. For 62 out of the 254
measurements (9%), the product yield or the scattering intensity of some products was too low to identify the solid form, or the
materials were wet.
bCrystallization modes: cooling-eVaporative (PSM), crash crystallization with anti-solvent addition (AS), grinding (GRP), slurry
(S1P), vapour diffusion onto solid (VDS) and vapour diffusion into solution (VDL). Freeze-drying (FD) was used to produce
amorphous material (see Phase I experiments). QSA (quantitative solubility experiment), see Phase I experiments.

[00174]              The polymorphic forms identified in these Phase 1 and Phase 2 experiments and
shown in Figure 2 were assigned primarily on XRPD analysis. In the course of this analysis, it
was observed that some patterns had similarities in the general fingerprint of the XRPD pattern
but showed some small differences like peaks shifting or smaller additional peaks. These types
of patterns were clustered as a class of patterns (e.g. HCl3-Class). Based on the XRPD, it was
concluded that the similarity between the XRPD patterns within a class is explained by the fact
that these solid forms are isomorphic hydrates/solvates (similar crystal packing but slightly
different unit cell parameters caused by the incorporation of the different solvents and water in
the crystal structure).
[00175]              The classes of isomorphic solvates were designated by a number (HCl3-Class)
or a number-letter combination (for example HC12 and HCl2b). The class of isomorphic
solvates/hydrates designated by a letter-number combination indicates that few sub-classes
were observed for this class in the experiment (example HC12 and HCl2b). When more than
three sub-classes could be identified within the class, all XRPD patterns corresponding to a
class of isomorphic solvates/hydrates were regrouped under one number (example HCl3
Class).
{00176]              The isomorphic solvates within a certain class or between classes designated
with the same number showed a higher degree of similarity of their XRPD patterns than in the
case of the classes of isomorphic solvates designated with different numbers. For these
different classes of isomorphic hydrates/solvates, the larger differences in the XRPD patterns
                                                                43

 reflect that the crystal structure packing is significantly different.
 [00177]          In some XRPD patterns, one or two additional peaks were observed compared to
 the identified forms, Since these peaks could not be assigned clearly to the known forms, they
 were indicated as "plus peaks".
                                               EXAMPLE 2
                        FURTHER DISCOVERY OF POLYMORPHIC FORMS
 [00178]          Follow on efforts were undertaken to analyze single crystals of 3-(imidazo[1,2
 b~pyridazin-3-ylethynyl)-4-methyl-N-{4-[(4-methyl piperazin-1 -yl)methyl]-3
(trifluoromethyl)phenyl}benzamide mono hydrochloride. Such efforts led to the discovery of five
different pseudo polymorphs with two of these additional polymorphic forms being previously
 undiscovered. These two newly discovered polymorphic forms are designated herein as HC17
(also referred to herein as "Form J") and HCI 8 (also referred to herein as "Form K"). In these
later experiments, three different crystallization techniques were used to grow single crystals of
suitable size for analysis: (1) slow evaporation of crystallization solvent; (2) diffusion of anti
solvent      into    a    solution    of   3-(imidazo[1 ,2-b]pyridazin-3-ylethynyl)-4-methyl-N-{4-[(4
methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl}benzamide mono hydrochloride; and (3)
temperature controlled crystallization. In total, 54 crystallization experiments were performed in
these later experiments to attempt to grow single crystals of the hydrated form of ponatinib
hydrochloride salt for structure determination.
[00179]           With regard to temperature controlled crystallization, 24 experiments were
prepared with mixtures of alcohols and water (see Table 15). For each experiment, 10 mg of
ponatinib hydrochloride was used. The mixtures of API and solvents were heated fast up to
800C and slowly cooled to room temperature (0.10C/min).

[001831           Form A is a crystalline, anhydrous solid that has been reproducibly obtained from
a range of solvents. Form HCI-1 is intrinsically chemically stable, which directly correlates to the
thermodynamic stability of the HCI 1 form.               Form HC[-1 is stable to thermal, pressure, and
humidity stress as well as exposure to some solvent vapors, and is thermodynamically stable.

Form HCI-1 is stable to thermal, pressure, and humidity stress as well as exposure to some
solvent vapors, and is the most thermodynamically stable solid form isolated to date.
Experiments were carried out to test the physical stability of the crystalline Form HCI1 as
follows:
The crystalline Form HCl1 and a physical mixture of HCl1 and amorphous material 50:50 were
exposed to ethanol vapour for two weeks (see vapour diffusion experiments)
Tablets were prepared by subjecting the crystalline Form HCl1 to a pressure of 50 and 100
kN/cm 2 (or 4 and 8 ton/cm2 ) for 10 sec.
Form A was stored in capsules for up to 17 months at ambient conditions. These samples were
analyzed by high resolution XRPD.
                                                          47

 The results obtained are summarized in Table 19 and the XRPD measurements and digUal
 images were obtained. They showed that within the stress conditions applied. the polymorphic
 Form HCI1 remained unchanged, confirming its good physical stability.

                                                PREPARATION OF FORM A
 100185]              Form A of ponatinib HCI is formed as a crystalline material by addition of a
 solution of HCI (1.0 equivalents) in ethanol to an ethanolic solution of the ponatinib free base.
The drug substance, ponatinib HCI, is crystallized in the last step of the drug substance
 synthetic process by addition of seed crystals which results in a very consistent and
 characteristic particle size and range for the drug substance. Ethanol content in the last 10
 multi-kilogram scale batches of ponatinib HCI in the HCI-1 form ranged from 0.8-1.2%.
 [00186]              No evidence of ethanol or water was found in the HCI-1 form; hence the Form A
is an anhydrate.             In addition, the crystal packing of the HCI-1 form does not contain voids
capable of accommodating ethanol or other small organic molecules. Additional studies to
investigate the ethanol content and the removal of ethanol from ponatinib HCI during drying
have indicated that the ethanol appears to be associated with the surface of the crystals in Form
A of ponatInib HCI,
                                                                  49

 [00187]        Form HCI-1 is characterized by the consistent presence of residual ethanol in all
 batches of drug substance at a level of approximately 1% by weight. Crystallographic studies
 and other studies have shown that residual ethanol is present (trapped) on the surface of the
crystals, and is not part of the crystalline unit cell, and that HCl-1 is not an ethanol solvate or
channel solvate. Ethanol levels in the last ten multi-kilogram scale drug substance batches
 have ranged from 0.8 to 1.2%.

                         SYNTHESIS OF PONATINIB HYDROCHLORIDE
[00188]         Ponatinib HCI is the product of the convergent four step synthesis depicted in
Scheme 1. Step 1 involves the synthesis of the "methyl ester" intermediate AP25047 from
starting materials AP24595, AP28141, and AP25570.            Step 2 involves the synthesis of the
"aniline" intermediate, AP24592, from starting Material AP29089. Step 3 is the base catalyzed
coupling of AP25047 and AP24592 to generate ponatinib free base, also designated as
AP24534, which is isolated as the free base. Step 4 is the formation and crystallization of the
mono-hydrochloride salt of ponatinib in ethanol.

[00190]         Step 1: Synthesis of AP25047 ("Methyl Ester") Intermediate
[00191]         Step 1 of the ponatinib HCI process is the synthesis of the methyl ester
intermediate AP25047 in a three reaction sequence (designated 1a, 1b, and 1c), carried out
without intermediate isolation ("telescoped"), from starting materials AP24595, AP25570, and
AP28141, as depicted in Scheme 2. The array of two aromatic ring systems connected by a
single   alkyne linker    is constructed      through   two tandem,       palladium/copper-catalyzed
Sonogashira couplings and an in situ desilylation reaction under basic conditions. The crude
AP25047 product is then subjected to a series of processing steps designed to remove residual
inorganic catalysts and process by-products. These operations include the crystallization of
AP25047 as the HCI salt from a non-polar solvent, toluene (Unit Operation 1,3), an aqueous
work-up and silica gel plug filtration (Unit Operation 1.4), and crystallization from a polar solvent,
2-propanol (Unit Operation 1.5). The two crystallizations provide orthogonal purifications for
rejection of related substance impurities with differing polarities. The crystallization and solvent
wash of the HCI salt from toluene is controlled by an in-process analytical test for a specific
                                                   51

 process impurity. The final crystallization of the AP25047 intermediate from 2-propanoi has
 been subjected to multi-variate DoE studies to define the design space for robust rejection of
other impurities arising from the telescoped reactions. A series of eight in-process tests in Step
 1 prove quantitative, analytical control for reaction completions, impurity rejection, and
effective removal of residual solvents,

 water content is determined by IPC-2 (KIF). If the IPC-2 criterion is met, the mixture is warmed
 to
45 - 60*C and 25% sodium methoxide solution in methanol is slowly added. The reaction
mixture is stirred and held for 30 - 60 minutes at 45 - 550 C. The reaction progress is
 determined by IPC-3 (HPLC). The reaction mixture may be held at a lower temperature during
the IPC analysis, If the IPC-3 criterion is met, the process is continued to Unit Operation 1.3.
 Unit Operation 1.3: Isolation of AP25047HCI
While stirring, the cool reaction mixture is quenched by addition of hydrogen chloride gas. A
precipitate forms, and residual hydrogen chloride is removed from the suspension by a nitrogen
purge. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) is replaced with toluene by an azeotropic distillation under
reduced pressure. The resulting warm slurry is filtered in an agitated filter dryer and the filter
cake is triturated and washed with warm toluene. The content of process impurity AP29116 is
determined by IPCA (HPLC). If the IPC-4 criterion is met, the wet filter cake is dried with
agitation under a flow of nitrogen and reduced pressure at 35 - 45"C (acket temperature). The
drying is monitored by IPC-5 (LOD, gravimetric). If the IPC-5 criterion is met, the crude
AP25047 HCI is discharged and packaged in FEP bags in a plastic container. The isolated
AP25047 HCI can be held for up to 7 days prior to forward processing.
Unit Operation 1.4: Work-up
The crude AP25047 HCI solid is charged to a reactor with dichloromethane (DCM) and washed
with aqueous ammonia. The aqueous phase is back extracted with DCM for yield recovery
purposes and the combined organic phase is washed a second time with aqueous ammonia.
The organic layer is then washed with aqueous hydrochloric acid until the aqueous phase
reaches a pH of 1-2, as indicated by IPC-6 (pH strips). If the IPC-6 criterion is met, the organic
phase is treated with aqueous sodium bicarbonate until the aqueous wash reaches a pH of NLT
7, as indicated by IPC-7 (pH strips). The organic phase is briefly concentrated followed by the
addition of fresh dichloromethane. The organic solution is passed through a sifica gel pad,
which is then rinsed with additional fresh dichloromethane for increased product recovery.

The dichloromethane solution is concentrated under reduced pressure, and the
dichloromethane is replaced with 2-propanol by azeotropic distillation under reduced pressure to
the targeted final volume range. The resulting suspension is then cooled and further aged with
agitation.
Unit Operation 1.6: Isolation/ Drying
The precipitated product is isolated in an agitated filter dryer under a flow of nitrogen, and the
filter cake is rinsed with 2-propanol. The wet filter cake is dried with agitation under a flow of
nitrogen and reduced pressure at 45 - 550 C (jacket temperature). The drying is monitored by
IPC-8 (LOD, gravimetric). If the IPC-8 criterion is met, the product is sampled and packaged
into polyethylene bags and placed within a heat sealed mylar coated aluminum foil bag, within
an HDPE shipping container (Expected yield range, 65 - 89%).
Step 2: Synthesis of AP24592 ("Aniline") Intermediate
Summary and Synthetic Scheme
Step 2 of the ponatinib HCI process is the synthesis of the aniline intermediate, AP24592, by
catalytic hydrogenation of the nitro-aromatic starting material AP29089, as depicted below. The
reaction is carried out in ethyl acetate, a solvent in which the starting material and product are
highly soluble. The catalyst for this reaction is palladium on carbon, and hydrogen is introduced
as a gas directly into the reaction mixture. At the completion of the reaction, a solvent exchange
from ethyl acetate to n-heptane via distillation prompts the spontaneous crystallization of
AP24592, resulting in material with high purity. This crystallization has been shown to have a
significant purification effect, as most of the process impurities remain solubilized in n-heptane.
The three in-process controls in Step 2 are an HPLC of the reaction mixture to confirm
consumption of starting material, a GC measurement of ethyl acetate following the azeotropic
solvent exchange to n-heptane, and a gravimeiric determination of solvent loss on drying.

Unit Operation 2. 1: Dissolution and Hydrogen Purging
AP29089, 10% palladium on carbon, and ethyl acetate are charged to a reactor, and the
suspension is stirred under hydrogen pressure.
Unit Operation 2.2: Hydrogenation
The reactor is pressurized with hydrogen until a stable pressure range is achieved and the
mixture is then stirred under hydrogen atmosphere for at least 4 additional hours. The reactor is
depressurized and a sample taken to assess reaction completion (IPC-1). Ifthe IPC-1 criterion
is met, the process is continued to Unit Operation 2.3
Unit Operation 2.3: Concentration / Crystallization
The reaction mixture is passed through a filter cartridge to remove the catalyst, and the
cartridge is washed with additional ethyl acetate. The combined filtrate and wash solution is
concentrated under vacuum to remove a target volume of ethyl acetate. n-Heptane is charged,
and the distillation is continued under vacuum to a target volume. The ethyl acetate content is
determined by IPC-2 (GC). Ifthe IPC-2 criterion is met, the process is continued to Unit
Operation 2.4.

 range of 80 - 97 % (based on AP29089 input).
Step 3: Synthesis of Ponatinib Free Base
Summary and Synthetic Scheme
Step 3 is the synthesis of the free base of ponatinib by the base-catalyzed reaction of AP25047
and AP24592, presented in Scheme 3. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a strong
base, potassium tert-butoxide, under essentially water-free conditions to minimize the undesired
hydrolysis of the methyl ester of AP25D47 to the corresponding unreactive carboxylic acid,
AP24600. The presence of this by-product results in not only loss of yield, but in complications
in downstream processing during the reaction workup. Drying of the reaction mixture by a
series of azeotropic distillations, controlled by an in-process test for water, ensures a robust
reaction and nearly quantitative consumption of starling materials. The parameters of the
reaction conditions and crystallization, in which process impurities are robustly rejected, are well
understood on the basis of DoE studies.

Unit Operation 4.1: Dissolution
AP24534 free base and absolute ethanol (EtOH) are charged to a reactor and stirred at 60
750C to generate a solution. Dissolution is verified by visual observation.
Unit Operation 4.2: Clarification
The solution is passed through a filter, which is then washed with ethanol at 60-78"C.
                                                  58

 Unit Operation 4.3: AcidificationI Seeding
 The product solution is concentrated under vacuum to a target volume. With stirring, an initial
 portion (approximately 25%) of a solution of 1N hydrogen chloride in ethanol is then charged to
 the reactor. The solution is treated with qualified seed crystals of AP24534 HCI at a
 temperature of 60-70"C to initiate crystallization. The process is continued to Unit Operation
 4.4.
 Unit Operation 4.4: Crystallization
 Once the presence of solids in the reactor is verified by visual observation, the remainder
 (approximately 75%) of the 1N hydrogen chloride solution in ethanol is slowly added to the
 stirred mixture. The mixture is aged for at least 10 minutes and IPC-1 is performed to determine
 the pH of the solution, If the IPC criterion is met, the mixture is cooled to a temperature of 5
 15'C and aged with stirring.
 Unit Operation 4.5: Isolation/ Drying
 The solid product is isolated by filtration and washed with ethanol at a temperature of 5-15"C,
 Excess ethanol is removed from the solid product by slow agitation and nitrogen flow at ambient
 temperature. The solid is then dried under vacuum at 60-70"C. The drying is monitored by
 IPC-2 (LOD, gravimetric), If the IPC-2 criterion is met, ponatinib HCI is discharged as an off
 white to yellow solid and packaged In double polyethylene bags for storage in plastic drums at
 20 - 30"C.
