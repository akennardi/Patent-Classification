      RESINS, RESIN/FIBRE COMPOSITES, METHODS OF USE AND METHODS OF
                                PREPARATION
         This disclosure accompanies a divisional application of
 5 AU<removed-apn>, the contents of which are incorporated herein in
   their entirety by reference.
   Field of the disclosure
10       The present disclosure pertains to resins, fibres, and/or
   resin/fibre composites.
   Background of the disclosure
15       Fibre reinforced polymer composites are known in the art and
   are commonly made by reacting a curable resin with a reactive
   diluent in the presence of a free radical initiator. Typically,
   the curable resin is an unsaturated polyester resin and the
   reactive diluent is a vinyl monomer. Reinforcing materials such as
20 fibre are often included in the formulations. Such reinforced
   composites are used in many industrial applications, including:
   construction, automotive, aerospace, and marine and for corrosion
   resistant products.
25       For many fibre reinforced polymer composites, the fibre
   lengths typically range from about 3mm and greater, for example,
   filament winding. In these fibre polymer composites the majority
   of fibres are held in position by mechanical friction and there is
   only relatively weak bonding of the fibres to the resin matrix.
30 Therefore, the performance of such polymer composites is
   influenced by the length of the fibres employed and in these
   composites there is a discontinuity/gap/space between the fibres
   and the resin. Cracks initiated in the resin matrix find it
   difficult to jump gaps, therefore in these composites cracks
35 initiated in the resin are usually arrested at the resin boundary
   and do not reach the fibre surface. However, traditional
   resin/fibre composites have a number of shortcomings.

                                   - 2
         For example, it is difficult to "wet" the fibres with the
   resin composition prior to curing, and even dispersion of long
   fibres throughout the composite is difficult, especially for
   complex parts.
 5
         In addition, such traditional fibre reinforced polymer
   composites are limited by their production techniques, which
   generally require manual layering, or are limited in the shape and
   complexity of the moulds.
10
         To overcome some of these shortcomings, short fibres, such as
   short glass fibres, may be used, for example, as disclosed in
   International Application No. PCT/AU2006/001536.
15       Very Short Fibre Polymerisable Liquid Composites  ("VSFPLCs")
   can produce composites with a number of desirable properties.
   VSFPLCs can be used to replace standard fibre layouts in a variety
   of applications, for example, open and closed moulding
   applications and also can be used, for example, as alternatives to
20 thermoplastics in resin injection moulding and/or rotation
   moulding applications. They can also be used with traditional
   laminates. Typically, the fibres in VSFPLCs form strong chemical
   bonds between the resin and the fibres during the curing process.
   Coupling agents may be used to achieve this. A problem with silane
25 coupling agents is that, unmodified, they can provide catalytic
   surfaces that tend to cause embrittlement of very short
   fibre/resin formulations over time. PCT/AU2006/001536 describes a
   fibre treatment which substantially reduces the tendency to become
   brittle with time. Prior to the fibre treatment disclosed in the
30 above referenced patent many attempts were made to reduce
   embrittlement of such composites. However, none of these attempts
   were fully successful. One of the issues with the earlier prior
   art  (before PCT/AU2006/001536) was that as the flexural strength
   of these earlier composites increased so did the flexural modulus,
35 which reduced the area under the stress strain curve and increased
   brittleness. Also these earlier composites had little resistance
   to crack propagation. If the composites developed a tiny crack, or
   if there was an imperfection in the surface under tension, the

                                   - 3
   ultimate yield stress, for example, could drop from 150MPa for
   pristine laminates down to less than 8OMPa for panels with small
   defects in the surface under tension.
 5       In addition, very short fibre composites made using
   commercially available milled glass have been found to be lacking
   in one or more properties, for example, the composites are
   brittle, have poor impact resistance, poor resistance to crack
   propagation and/or the interphase became brittle with time.
10 Furthermore, in order to produce strong composites the fibre
   volume fraction was high and that influenced the physical
   properties. Polymerizing the coupling agent on the surface of the
   fibre did not reduce embrittlement because the interphase did not
   have similar properties to the bulk resin.
15
         The present disclosure is directed to overcome and/or
   ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art,   as
   will become apparent from the discussion herein.   The present
   disclosure is also to provide other advantages and/or improvements
20 as discussed herein.
         The above references to the background art do not constitute
   an admission that the art forms a part of the common general
   knowledge of a person of ordinary skill in the art.   The above
25 references are also not  intended to limit the application of the
   various embodiments and aspects as disclosed herein.

   suitable for use in VSFPLCs. Certain embodiments are directed to
   producing thermoset resins suitable for use in VSFPLCs and other
   composites.
25
        Certain aspects of the present disclosure are directed to
   resins for use with short fibres and/or VSFPLCs for producing
   products, such as composites and/or laminates, that have one or
   more of following properties: adequate tensile strength, adequate
30 flexural strength, good ductility   (i.e. is not brittle), adequate
   toughness and/or crack resistance. Certain aspects of the present
   disclosure are directed to VSFPLC products formulated from tough,
   crack resistant thermosets, and surface treated very short glass
   and/or ceramic fibres. For example, very short fibres manufactured
35 by MIRteq Pty Limited.
        Certain embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to
   VSFPLCs that may be used for producing laminates comprising at

                                    -  37
   least one or more of the following properties: a tensile strength
   greater than 40MPa, a flexural strength greater than 60MPa, and/or
   a sufficient lack of brittleness i.e.     Izod un-notched impact
   resistance greater than or equal to 3 KJ/m 2 . Toughness with
 5 respect to certain embodiments may be defined as the area under
   the stress/strain curve, i.e.,     the amount of energy measured in
   Joules required to break a standard test bar that is 120mm x 18mm
   x 6mm in flexure which is typically 2 to 2.5J. Other values for
   toughness may also be used. Certain embodiments are directed to
10 methods of making composites with very short fibres wherein the
   composite has one or more of the following properties: adequate
   tensile strength, adequate flexural strength, adequate ductility
    (i.e., lacking brittleness),  good impact resistance    (greater than
   or equal to 3 KJ/m 2 ), and/or is resistant to crack propagation,
15 wherein the fibre volume fraction is between 3 to 12%,      10 to 12%,
   13 to 17%,  18 to 27%, 28 to 37%,    38 to 45% of the total volume of
   the composite. In these embodiments, the fibre has little
   influence on the physical properties of the composite before
   curing. Other values for good impact resistance may also be used.
20
         In contrast to certain disclosed embodiments, untreated very
   short fibre composites made with commercially available milled
   glass and commercially available laminating resins do not produce
   the minimum properties required for a serviceable liquid composite
25 because commercially available milled fibres surfaces act as a
   positive catalyst in vinyl functional resins, increase the cross
   linking density in the interphase over time and causes
   embrittlement.
30       In certain embodiments, a substantial portion of the fibres
   may overlap each other, or substantially overlap each other,
   because the stress imparted to the fibres is zero, or near zero,
   at the ends of the fibres and is at a maximum, or near maximum,
   towards the middle of the fibres.
35
         In certain embodiments, at least one fibre of the plurality
   of fibres may have at least one other fibre that is within a
   cylindrical space about the at least one fibre, wherein the

                                         -  38
   cylindrical space has the at least one fibre as its axis and has a
   diameter that is between 1.25 to 6 times the diameter of the at
   least one fibre, for example no greater than 1.5 times the
   diameter of the at least one fibre,          such as no greater than twice,
 5 no greater than 3 times, no greater than 4 times, no greater than
   five times, or no greater than 6 times the diameter of the at
   least one fibre.       In certain embodiments, between 50 wt.%          and 99
   wt.%    of the plurality of fibres are independently overlapped by at
   least one other fibre within the resin-fibre composite, for
10 example, at least 50 wt.%, such as at least 60 wt.%;            at least 70
   wt.%;    at least 75 wt.%;    at least 80 wt.%;     at least 85 wt.%;       at
   least 90 wt.%;    at least 92 wt.%;       at least 95 wt.%;   at least 97
   wt.%;    or at least 98 wt.%;    of the plurality of fibres are
   independently overlapped by at least one other fibre within the
15 resin-fibre composite.        So if fibres are going to act in concert,
   it is desirable that they overlap. In certain embodiments, this
   desirable overlapping therefore defines the minimum quantity of
   very short fibres that will act together to reinforce composites.
   See Table 1 below for some exemplary embodiments of composites and
20 of the properties that may be present with varying fibre content.
   The fibres used in this table are treated very short fibres that
   have been prepared according to certain embodiments.

           Certain embodiments are directed to treating the fibres to
   create the chemical bond/adhesion between the resin and the
   fibres. This treatment involves treating the interphase between
   the resin composition and the fibre to achieve one or more of the
30 following:

                                    - 39
       a) plasticize the interphase to reduce, or substantially reduce,
          interfacial stress in the cured composite;
       b) modify the interphase so that one or more of selected
          physical properties  (i.e. tensile modulus, tensile
 5        elongation, flexural modulus and/or flexural elongation) are
          similar, substantially similar, or sufficiently similar to
          selected physical properties of the bulk resin in the liquid
          composite and/or cured composite;
       c) efficiently transmit stress from the bulk resin to the
10        suspended fibres in the cured composite;
       d) passivate the catalytic surface of the fibre in the liquid
          composite and/or the cured composite;
       e) substantially match the surface energy of the fibre with the
          surface tension of the resin to encourage wetting by reducing
15        the contact angle of the resin on the fibre in the liquid
          composite; and/or
       f)  chemically bond the coupling agent to the fibre surface so
          that the fibre forms a strong chemical bond with the
          thermoset resin via the coupling agent during the curing
20        process. These chemical bonds allow stresses that form in the
          cured resin matrix to be efficiently transferred to the very
          short fibres.
          Certain embodiments are to resin-fibre composite(s),
25 comprising:
   wherein: the resin-fibre   composite has one or more of the
   following properties:
   i)     a flexural modulus of between 1 to 7 GPa;
   ii)    a flexural strength of between 30 to 150 MPa;
30 iii) a flexural elongation at break of between 2 to 20%;
   iv)    a tensile strength of between 20 to 110 MPa;
   v)     a tensile modulus of between 1 to 7 GPa;
   vi)    a tensile elongation of between 2 to 15%;
   vii) an unnotched Izod impact strength of between 1.5 to 6 KJ/m 2;
35 viii)a HDT of between 50 to 1500C;
   ix)    exhibits increased resistance to crack propagation;
   x)     energy required to break a standard panel in flexure greater
   than or equal to 2.5J;   and/or

                                     -   40
   xi)   is substantially isotropic.
         In certain aspects, the flexural modulus may be between 1 to
   2 GPa;  2 to 2.5 GPa;  3 to 4 GPa;     4.5 to 5.6 GPa;  5.5 to 7 GPa, 1
 5 to 4 GPa or 3 to 7 GPa.    In certain aspects, the flexural strength
   may be between 25 to 125 MPa;    30 to 40 MPa;     35 to 55 MPa;   45 to 80
   MPa;  70 to 140 MPa;  or 100 to 150MPa.      In certain aspects, the
   flexural strength may be greater than 25,       30,  40, 55,  70,  100,
   120,  140, or 150 GPa.   In certain aspects, the flexural elongation
10 at break may be between 2 to 20%;       2 to 2.5%;  3 to 3.8%;   4 to 6%;  5
   to 9%;  9 to 20%;  2 to 10% or 15 to 20%.      In certain aspects, the
   flexural elongation at break may be greater than 2%,         6%,  9%,  15%
   or 20%.   In certain aspects, the tensile strength may be between
   20 to 35 MPa;   40 to 65 MPa;  or 70 to 110 MPa.      In certain aspects,
15 the tensile strength may be greater than 20 MPa, 35 MPa, 40 MPa,
   65 MPa;  70MPa 100 MPa or 110 MPa.       In certain aspects the tensile
   modulus may be between 1 to 7 GPa;       1 to 2 GPa;  2.5 to 3.3 GPa;    3.6
   to 4.5 GPa;  and > 4.5 GPa.    In certain aspects, the tensile
   elongation may be between 2% to 15%;       2 to 2.5%;  3 to 4%;   and 3.5
20 to 8%.   In certain aspects, the unnotched Izod impact strength may
   be between 1.5 to 6 KJ/m2;    1.5 to 2 KJ/m2;     2.5 to 3.5 KJ/m2;    3.5
   to 6 KJ/m2.    In certain aspects, the HDT may be between 50 to
   1500C;  50 to 600C;  60 to 850C;    75 to 1120C;   70 to 750C;   110 to
   1500C.   In certain aspects, the energy required to break a
25 standard panel in flexure may greater than or equal to 2.5J, 3J,
   3J,  3.5J, 4J or 6J.   In certain aspects, the energy required to
   break a standard panel in flexure may between 2.5 to 3J;          3 to
   3.5J;  4 to 6J;  2.5 to 6J or 3 to 6J.
30       Certain embodiments are directed to sufficiently matching the
   properties of the interphase with those of the bulk resin to
   reduce embrittlement in the cured composite        (i.e. the loss of
   flexural elongation over time).
35       Certain embodiments are directed to combining selected resins
   with selected short fibres that act in synergy to produce VSFPLCs
   with optimum properties. Certain embodiments are directed to
   producing strong, tough thermosets with excellent resistance to

                                   - 41
   crack propagation wherein selected properties of the interphase
   and the bulk resin are sufficiently similar and maintain
   appropriate adhesion between the interphase and the fibre surface.
 5      In certain embodiments, it is desirable to keep the length of
   the fibres used very short so that an appropriate viscosity of the
   liquid composite may be maintained. In certain aspects,
   appropriate viscosities range from 500 to 5,000cPs at 250C. In
   other aspects, appropriate viscosities range from 300 to 7,000cPs,
10 700 to 6,000cPc, 1,000 to 4,000cPs, or 750 to 5,000cPs at 250C.
   One of the advantages of certain disclosed embodiments  is that
   resin-fibre mixtures have an appropriate viscosity such that the
   mixtures may be sprayable and/or pumpable. In certain embodiments
   this is accomplished by combining the resin matrix with very short
15 fibres wherein the coatings on the surfaces of these fibres are
   able to chemically bond with the resin matrix during
   polymerization/curing allowing stresses to be efficiently
   transmitted from the resin matrix into the fibres.
20      VSFPLCs can be used to replace standard fibreglass lay-ups in
   open and closed moulding applications. They can also be used as an
   alternative to thermoplastics in resin injection moulding and
   rotational moulding and can be used with traditional laminates.
   Some of the advantages of VSFPLC technology over standard
25 fibreglass fabrication include one or more of the following: more
   environmentally friendly than most current fibreglass fabrication
   technologies;  quicker and easier to use than current fibreglass
   fabrication technologies;  productivity gains; and/or produces a
   safer work environment. VSFPLC materials are isotropic, or
30 substantially isotropic, which means they can be moulded more
   easily and open up more design opportunities than standard
   fibreglass laminates. They also have much improved dimensional
   stability, more consistent physical properties, involve less
   labour because there is less materials handling and lamination,
35 and/or lower hazardous air pollutants in the work environment.
   FIGURE  6 is a photo of untreated standard E-glass rovings of about
   4mm lengths that is used to mill suitable fibres. The rovings have
   been rubbed between the hands to illustrate how the strands

                                  -  42
   separate into discrete filaments when the rovings are milled.
   FIGURE 7 is a photo of treated thermoplastic resin injection
   moulding E-glass fibres of about 4mm lengths that have been rubbed
   between the hands in the same manner as the glass rovings in
 5 Figure 6. These fibres are treated so that they do not separate
   into discrete filaments because it is important that they do not
   break down when sheared in a thermoplastic resin injection
   machine. They rely on frictional interaction and their strand
   length for their strength contribution. FIGURE 8 is a
10 photomicrograph of the milled and untreated Figure 6 E-glass
   rovings broken down into individual filaments less than 1mm,
   according to certain embodiments. The strength of the chemical
   bond achieved between the resin and the treated fibres is at least
   in part a function of the increased surface area provided by the
15 glass  filaments.
         Additional advantages of certain embodiments may be found,
   for example, in resin injection and rotational moulding
   applications. For example, one or more of the following advantages
20 may be present in certain embodiments:  the moulds and resin
   injection equipment used is cheaper to build than that used in
   current thermoplastic injection; and/or certain VSFPLCs allow for
   improved productivity compared with RTM and light RTM processes
   currently used in thermoset injection molding as no, or less,
25 glass reinforcement is required to be tailored and placed into
   moulds prior to injection. This allows for quicker mould
   turnaround than resin infusion moulding and therefore provides
   improved productivity;  VSFPLC laminates may be isotropic, or
   substantially isotropic and therefore are much easier to design
30 than standard long fibreglass laminates; VSFPLC laminates have
   better dimensional stability compared with standard long
   fibreglass laminates  (standard long fibre laminates have mean
   fibre lengths equal to or greater than 2mm);  and VSFPLCs have more
   consistent physical properties.
35
         Certain aspects of the present application are directed to
   approaches that maintain high yield stress and at the same time
   reduce embrittlement in the resin-fiber composites and/or VSFPLC

                                   - 43
   laminates. These approaches require attention to one or more of
   the following four areas:   1) the fibre surface;  2) the interphase;
   3) the bulk resin;  and/or 4) the fibre fraction.
 5       THE FIBRE SURFACE AND  TREATMENT AND THE FIBRE FRACTION
         In certain embodiments, it is desirable that the fibres used
   are minimized as the fibres can act as a positive catalyst which
   can change the properties of the interphase so that it may be more
10 brittle than the matrix resin.
         In certain embodiments, it is desirable that the fibres used
   in VSFPLCs are processed such that positive catalyst activities
   are reduced and/or minimized. Positive catalyst activities can
15 change the properties of the interphase so that it may become more
   brittle than the matrix resin. For example, fibres manufactured by
   MIRteq Pty Ltd may be used as these fibres have little adverse
   effect on the resin interphase and are suitable for the
   manufacture of VSFPLCs.
20
         In certain embodiments, fibres may include microglass milled
   fibers, such as E-glass filaments. These fibres may provide
   reinforcement in VSFPLCs to increase mechanical properties;    such
   as impact, tensile, compressive and flexural; improve dimensional
25 stability;  and/or minimize distortion at elevated temperatures.
   For example, suitable fibres may include, but are not limited to,
   one or more of the following characteristics:    a mean fibre
   diameter of 10 microns;  a mean fibre length of less than 500
   microns,  (with minimal dust);  an aspect ratio of 33:1;  a loose
30 bulk density of 0.22 to 0.30g/cc; a moisture content of less than
   0.1%;  a loss on ignition of less than 1.05%; are free, or
   substantially free, of contaminations, such as contamination from
   foreign matter, dirt, oil, or grease, as well as free, or
   substantially free, of hard lumps of nodulated and/or unmilled
35 fibers;  a white color; a silane sizing;  and/or a Floccular
   appearance.
         Certain embodiments are directed to a modification on the

                                          -  44
   surface of very short reinforcing fibres suspended in vinyl
   functional resins wherein the resulting interphase has the same,
   substantially the same, or similar bulk physical properties to the
   matrix resin.

   embodiments       and commercially available fibres.

10
           The surfaces of silane treated ceramic fibres may be
   catalytic. They can increase the crosslinking density close to the
   fibres in what is called the interphase zone. This may have the
   effect of causing the cured composite to become brittle with time.
15 The fibres used in certain embodiments of the present disclosure
   have been treated so that the surface no longer acts as a catalyst
    (or substantially reduces this activity),         and/or the crosslinking
   density/properties of the interphase substantially mirror one or
   more selected properties of the matrix resin            (i.e. tensile
20 modulus, tensile elongation, flexural modulus and/or flexural
   elongation) .
           In certain embodiments, it is desirable for the resins used
   in VSFPLCs to be as tough and resilient as possible. This is
25 exemplified by the energy required to break panels. Resins used in
   VSFPLCs with tensile elongations under 2% give < 1 Joule of the
   energy required to break a standard panel with 20%            glass content
   by weight. Resins used in VSFPLCs with tensile elongations between
   2-4% require 1-2 joules to rupture a 20%          glass filled panel.
30 Resins used in VSFPLCs with tensile elongations between 4-6%
   require 2-2.8 joules to rupture a 20% glass filled panel. Panels

                                    - 45
    made from resins used in VSFPLCs with tensile elongation > 6%
    require greater than 3 joules to rupture a 20% glass filled panel.
    Typically, the higher the tensile elongation of the matrix resin
    the greater the energy required to rupture the panel.
  5
          In certain liquid composite embodiments which use fibres that
    have not been treated with appropriately   (e.g., MIRteq treatments
    or other treatments) the articles become brittle with time. This
    happens because the untreated fibres behave as a catalyst that
10  increases the cross linking density in the interphase such that
    the interphase is more highly cross linked than the bulk resin
    matrix. This embrittling is a time dependent process. As time
    passes the interphase become more and more brittle and therefore
    possibly no longer fit for service.
15
          In certain embodiments, a coupling agent may be needed in
    VSFPLCs as the fibres may be shorter than their corresponding
    critical fibre length. A potential problem with coupling agents
    and naked ceramic fibres is that they both have a catalytic
20  surface that increases the crosslinking density in the interphase
    thereby causing embrittlement.
          Certain embodiments are directed to treating the fibres to
    create the chemical bond/adhesion between the resin and the fibres
25  and the use of such fibres. This treatment involves treating the
    interphase between the resin composition and the fibre to achieve
    one or more of the following:
       a) plasticize the interphase to reduce, or substantially reduce,
          interfacial stress in the cured composite;
30     b) modify the interphase so that one or more selected physical
          properties are similar, substantially similar, or
          sufficiently similar to selected physical properties of the
          bulk resin in the liquid composite and/or cured composite;
           (i.e. tensile modulus, tensile elongation, flexural modulus
35        and/or flexural elongation)
       c) efficiently transmit stress from the bulk resin to the
          suspended fibres in the cured composite;
       d) passivate the catalytic surface of the fibre in the liquid

                                   - 46
         composite and/or cured composite;
      e) match the surface energy of the fibre with the surface
         tension of the resin to encourage wetting by reducing the
         contact angle of the resin on the fibres in the liquid
 5       composite; and/or
      f) chemically bond the coupling agent to the fibre surface so
         that the fibre forms a strong chemical bond with the
         thermoset resin via the coupling agent during the curing
         process. These chemical bonds allow stresses that form in the
10       cured resin matrix to be efficiently transferred to the very
         short fibres.
         A variety of short fibres and very short fibres may be used
   with certain embodiments.
15
         VSFPLC fibres may be treated with coupling agents. In some
   aspects, it is desirable that the treated fibres minimize the
   positive catalyst activity. In some aspects, it is desirable that
   the fibres used herein do not substantially increase the cross
20 linking density in the interphase.
         In certain embodiments, the fibres may have a length
   distribution as  follows: 98% passing through a 1mm sieve and at
   least 50% passing through a 0.5mm screen with approximately 10%
25 passing through a 0.1mm screen. An exemplary mean fibre length may
   be between 0.3 and 0.7mm. Other mean fibre lengths may also be
   used as disclosed herein. In certain embodiments, the fibre length
   and/or the fibre length distribution may have an impact on the
   performance and/or properties of the cured composite. In certain
30 embodiments, the mean fiber length is between 0.2 to 0.4mm, 0.5 to
   1mm, 0.2 to 0.7mm, 0.3 to 1mm, or 0.3 to 0.8mm or 0.3 to 0.7mm.
         In some embodiments, to minimize the surface of treated
   fibres from becoming catalysts for accelerating free radical
35 polymerization, it may be useful to passivate the fibre surface.
   For example, this may be achieved by:   1. coating the fibre surface
   with humectants;  or 2. emulsifying a quantity of water in one of
   the fibre coating solutions and adding these to the fibres when

                                  - 47
   compounding coatings on to the surface of the fibres. For example,
   the fibres may already be coated with humectants as well as mixed
   with an emulsion. Other ways to passivate the fibres may also be
   used. In certain embodiments, an aim of the fibre treatment is to
 5 produce in the cured laminate an interphase with physical
   properties similar to, or the same as, the bulk resin matrix.
        In certain embodiments, suitable fibres, for example E-glass
   and S-glass, may have one or more of the following
10 characteristics: strength, such as tensile strength of between 20
   to 110 MPa or a flexural strength of between 30 to 150 MPa;
   minimal or no leaching when placed in deionized water; generally
   chemically resistant; and/or good electrical resistance.   Other
   ranges and characteristics may also be used as disclosed herein.
15 The fibre length may be between about 40 to 100 p, 40 to 150 p,   40
   to 200 p, 40 to 250 p, 40 to 300 p, 40 to 350 p up to 1,500 p.   In
   certain embodiments, it is desirable that the fibre distribution
   is such that it does not cause matting when dispersed in an un
   thixed laminating resin with a viscosity between 300cPs and 700cPs
20 in the weight percent range of 12 to 65% of the total laminate
   composite. In certain embodiments, it is desirable that the fibre
   distribution be such that it results in minimum matting when
   dispersed in an un-thixed laminating resin that have a viscosity
   between 200cPs and 900cPs, 300cPs and 500cPs, 250cPs and 700cPs,
25 or 400 cPs and 600cPs in the weight percent range of 5 to 70%, 10
   to 40%, 20 to 65%, 30 to 70%, or 15 to 65% of the total laminate
   composite. Various combinations of the viscosity range and weight
   percentage range are contemplated as long as the matting is kept
   at an acceptable level. In certain embodiments, various fibre
30 lengths and fibre distributions may be used as long as the fibre
   length and fibre distribution are such that it does not cause
   matting when dispersed. Composites made with short fibres or very
   short fibres may have certain properties that differ from the
   properties of long fibres when used in certain resin-fibre
35 formulations. Typical long fibre composites may be defined as
   composites made with at least 5% of the fibres in the composite,
   on a weight basis where the fiber length is longer than 2mm.

                                    - 48
         The amount of fibre used in the resin/fibre composite may
   vary. In certain embodiments, the weight percentage of the fibres
   may be between 5 to 65 wt.%,   10 to 65 wt.%,   12 to 65 wt.%,  10 to
   50 wt.%,  20 to 50 wt.%  or 10 to 30 wt.%  of the resin-fibre
 5 composite.
         In certain embodiments, the properties and characteristics
   that have been attributed the at least one fibre of the plurality
   of fibres within a resin composition, a resin-fibre composite, or
10 a liquid resin-fibre composite as disclosed herein may be
   attributable to between 50 wt.%    to 99 wt.% of the plurality of
   fibres in said resin composition, said resin-fibre composite, or
   said liquid resin-fibre composite.     For example, at least 50 wt.%
   of the plurality of fibres, such as at least 75 wt.%;     at least 85
15 wt.%;  at least 90 wt.%;  at least 92 wt.%;  at least 95 wt.%;   at
   least 98 wt.%;  at least 99 wt.%   of the plurality of fibres in said
   resin composition, said resin-fibre composite, or said liquid
   resin-fibre composite.    In certain embodiments, the properties and
   characteristics attributed to the at least one fibre may be
20 between 75 wt.%  to 99 wt.%;  95 wt.%  to 99 wt.%;  50 wt.% to 70
   wt.%;  85 wt.% to 98 wt.%;  75 wt.%  to 90 wt.%  or 95 wt.% to 98 wt.%
   of the plurality of fibres in said resin composition, said resin
   fibre composite, or said liquid resin-fibre compositeIn some
   embodiments, VSFPLCs have at least 98%    of fibres less than 1mm on
25 a weight basis.   In other embodiments, at least 86%, 88%,    90%, 94%,
   or 98%  of fibres may be less than or equal to 0.7mm, 0.9mm, 1mm,
   1.1mm, 1.2mm, or 1.3mm on a weight basis. In some embodiments up
   to 40% of fibres may be less than 0.2mm. In some embodiments up to
   20%, 25%  30%, 35%  40%, 45% or 50% of the fibres may be less than
30 0.1mm 0.2mm, 0.3mm, 0.4mm or 0.5mm. In some embodiments, it is
   desirable that  substantial chemical bonding of the resin to the
   fibres occurs in such formulations for a substantial portion of
   the fibres used.
35       The use of very short fibres represents a radical departure
   from the resin to glass interphase in typical long fibre
   laminates. In typical long fibre laminates most of the interaction
   between resin and glass is frictional interaction and the fibre

                                   - 49
   length of these  fibres is typically greater than 2mm. In typical
   long fibre laminates, there is a gap/discontinuity between the
   resin matrix and the fibre. Cracks that form in typical long fibre
   composite resin matrix are arrested at this surface. VSFPLCs do
 5 not have this gap/discontinuity, hence their inherent tendency to
   brittle failure and a need for certain of the disclosed
   embodiments.
        This tendency to brittleness in VSFPLCs comes from cracks
10 initiating in the resin and traveling to the glass surface as a
   crack not a craze. Because the resin in certain VSFPLCs may be
   substantially chemically bonded to the fibres, or a substantial
   portion of the fibres, a portion of the energy driving the
   propagation of the crack is focused at a point, or points, on the
15 fibre, and the fibre may rupture allowing the crack to propagate
   through the fibre.
        In certain embodiments, a relatively small percentage of long
   fibres, i.e.,  fibres longer than 1mm, may interact to form pills
20 and/or agglomerates of fibres, especially when dispersed in a
   liquid  (See for example, Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4). These
   pills are difficult to remove because they keep reforming. Figures
   2 and 3 depict the effect of fiber length on pill formation. In
   Figure 3, the glass sample on the left has very few long fibres
25 and therefore does not have a tendency to pill. In contrast, the
   glass sample on the right has a slightly higher mean fibre length
   and forms pills regularly. Figure 4 depicts pill formation in
   milled fibres.
30      In some embodiments, it is difficult to disperse long fibres
   evenly in liquid composites which may cause the long fibres to
   produce lumps. These lumps if present in liquid composites may not
   accept chemical additives such as promoters and initiators, and
   therefore may form areas of under-cure in the composite, weakening
35 the structure. In addition, long fibres may also impede air
   release, again weakening the structure. To work towards
   eliminating or reducing pill formation:  1) reduce the mean fibre
   length to below 1mm;  reduce the percentage of fibres longer than

                                  - 50
   1mm, 1.1mm, 1.25mm, 1.4mm, 1.5mm, 1.7mm or 2mm to less than 3%,
   5%, 7% or 10% as a fraction weight, or combinations thereof. In
   certain embodiments, the mean fibre length may be in one of the
   following ranges 0.2mm to 0.4mm;  0.3mm to 0.5mm; 0.6mm to 0.7mm;
 5 0.8mm to 0.9mm;  0.2mm to 1mm or 0.3mm to 0.9mm.
        In order to facilitate a substantially even fibre
   distribution with as near a uniform inter-fibre distribution, in
   some embodiments it may be desirable to make a paste by dispersing
10 the fibres in resin using approximately equal weights of fibres
   and resin in a planetary mixer prior to dispersing in the matrix
   resin. If this process is carried out thoroughly, a substantial or
   sufficient portion of the fibres become coated with resin
   /polymer. Such dispersion aids in the eliminating and/or reducing
15 pill formation. In some aspects, eliminating pill formation is
   desirable for maintaining strength and/or for cosmetic reasons.
   The presence of pills may cause irregularities in the surface of
   cured VSFPLC objects. Exemplary treated fibres that may be used
   are disclosed herein.
20
        In certain embodiments, the fibre length distribution may
   also be relevant to the performance of the resin-fibre composites.
   For example, Figure 14 and Figure 15 show two graphs depicting
   three separate fibre distributions per graph. These graphs
25 illustrate that as the mean fibre fraction grows the greater the
   need for a tight fibre distribution in certain embodiments. In
   these embodiments, once the fibre fraction over approximately 1mm
   in length exceeds about 3% by weight of the liquid resin-fibre it
   may impact on the rheology of the liquid composite and encourage
30 pill formation.
        In certain embodiments, the optimum fibre fractions expressed
   in weight % of the liquid composite is between 15%  and 50%, where
   the desire is to optimise both yield stress and energy to rupture
35 a standard panel  (120mm x 18mm x 6mm) in flexure. In other
   embodiments, the optimum fibre fractions expressed in weight % of
   the liquid composite may be other percent ranges as disclosed
   herein.

                                   - 51
        In certain embodiments, the optimum mean fibre length
   distribution for glass and/or ceramic fibres may be between 200
   microns and 700 microns.  In other embodiments, the mean fibre
 5 length distribution may be other ranges as disclosed herein. In
   certain embodiments, the optimum fibre diameter distribution is
   between 5 microns and 20 microns. In other embodiments, the fibre
   diameter distribution may be other ranges as disclosed herein, for
   example between 5 microns and 10 microns, 5 microns and 25
10 microns, 10 microns to 25 microns, or 5 microns and 30 microns.
        In certain embodiments, liquid composites made with surface
   treated wollastonite fibres may have an aspect ratio greater than
   6 with a preferred aspect ratio of 12 or greater. In other
15 embodiments, composites made with surface treated wollastonite
   fibres may have an aspect ratio greater than 6, 8, 10,   12, 14, 16
   or 18.
        In certain embodiments, the fibres used may have an aspect
20 ratio greater than 6 with a preferred aspect ratio of 12 or
   greater, such as between 20 and 40.   In other embodiments, the
   fibres may have an aspect ratio greater than 6, 8, 10,   12, 14, 16,
   20, 25, 30,  35, 38, 40, 42, 45,  47, 50, 53, 55, 57 or 60.
25      In certain embodiments, liquid composites made with surface
   treated fibres may have an aspect ratio greater than 6 with a
   preferred aspect ratio of 12 or greater, such as between 20 and
   40. In other embodiments, composites made with surface treated
   fibres may have an aspect ratio greater than 6, 8, 10,   12, 14, 16,
30 20, 25, 30,  35, 38, 40, 42, 45,  47, 50, 53, 55, 57 or 60.
        In certain embodiments, fibre length and fibre length
   distributions in VSFPLCs may be restricted by the desired
   rheological properties. For example, over a certain % of long
35 fibres  (for example, fibres longer than 1mm) the liquid composite
   may start to lose it homogenous appearance and matting may start
   to form in the dispersion. This is undesirable as it interferes
   with the material's viscosity, degrades the cosmetic appearance

                                  - 52
   and/or reduces the serviceability of the cured composite.
        The fracture mechanics and the interaction between long fibre
   composites and VSFPLCs may be very different. VSFPLCs resin class
 5 interactions are through strong chemical bonds which when
   fractured fracture the bonded fibres - See micrographs Figures 21
   and 22. Standard fibreglass interactions are frictional. See
   micrograph Figure 20 where the absence of chemical bonding on the
   individual fibres is clearly apparent.
10
        In certain embodiments, both Sheet Moulding Compounds
   (SMC)/glass composites and Bulk Moulding Compounds  (BMC)/glass
   composites may be prepared with similar fibre treatments disclosed
   herein. SMC and BMC are both highly filled systems, therefore the
15 fibreglass in these systems has to compete with the fillers for
   the resin coating. The fibre treatments disclosed herein result in
   fibres that are substantially coated with a resin solution prior
   to incorporation into a SMC or BMC formulation. The result is that
   the fibres will interact more intimately with the other components
20 of the BMC and SMC formulations thereby improving the cosmetic
   finish, yield stress, minimizing fibre separation in deep
   pressings and improving the overall performance of the laminate.
   MAKING VSFPLC FIBRES
25
        The following discussion is directed to certain VSFPLC fibres
   that may be used with respect to certain disclosed embodiments.
   Many of the points discussed under this section may however be
   applicable to other disclosed embodiments.
30
        The type of fibre, fibre length distribution, fibre diameter,
   and/or the volume ratio of fibres in VSFPLCs may each play a role
   in the properties of the cured composite.
35      The rheology of the liquid resin-fibre composite may impact
   the fibre length used in certain embodiments. In certain
   embodiments, filaments in VSFPLCs are typically shorter than 1mm.
   Longer fibres tend to result in the formation of pills and/or

                                  - 53
   localised thickening that limits the amount of glass than can be
   added to a VSFPLC, and therefore may adversely affect the physical
   properties of the cured laminate.
 5      With respect to fibre diameter, it was initially theorized
   that the finer the glass filaments the stronger the resulting
   VSFPLC laminate. This was because the finer the diameter of the
   filament the shorter the filament length necessary to provide a
   given aspect ratio. This has not proved to be the case because the
10 treatment - coupling agents - silanes and their resultant
   compounds provide a catalytic surface for free radical
   polymerisation. This is not a desirable outcome because silane
   coupling agents increase the cross-linking density in the
   interphase causing the resultant composite to become brittle. Fine
15 diameter fibres have an increased specific surface which only
   aggravates the catalytic problem.   (The higher the specific
   surface, the stronger the catalytic effect).   One way to limit the
   catalytic effect of the fibres is to reduce their surface area.
   The surface area to volume ratio of a cylinder is inversely
20 proportional to the mean diameter of the filaments. So other
   things being equal, the larger the diameter of the filament the
   weaker its catalytic effect for a given volume of fibres. Also,
   the mean distance between filaments will increase for fibres with
   a greater diameter, which may be a very desirable outcome. The
25 greater the mean distance between fibres the more chance a crack
   has to stabilise before it reaches the fibre surface. The lower
   the cross-linking density at the fibre surface the less energy the
   propagating crack has while travelling through the interphase,
   this means less energy is focused at a point on the surface of the
30 fibre minimizing its tendency to rupture. By experiment, with
   respect to certain embodiments, the suitable diameter fibres are
   in the range 5 to 20micron. Other diameters may be used as
   disclosed herein.
35      With respect to fibre volume fraction, this may impact on the
   performance of a VSFPLC since it is related to the volume % of
   reinforcing fibres in the composite. Figure 16 illustrates the
   effect of fibre fraction on the yield stress of a VSFPLC

                                  - 54
   composite. As the catalytic nature of the fibre surface decreases,
   the initial dip caused by the addition of a small quantity of
   fibres becomes less pronounced. The second dip is caused by the
   inter-fibre distance decreasing, which reduces the resin's ability
 5 to stabilise cracks before they reach the interphase and
   ultimately the fibre surface.
        With respect to the catalytic surface, minimizing the surface
   area of the fibres may limit their effectiveness as catalysts. The
10 larger the fibre diameter the lower the surface area of the fibres
   for a given fibre volume/weight fraction, the lower the catalytic
   effect. In certain embodiments, this is desirable. As the diameter
   of a fibre increases so does its critical fibre length. This is
   because the tensile strength of the fibre increases by the square
15 of the radius, while the specific surface is decreasing. This
   therefore may set, in certain embodiments, a typical upper limit
   for fibre diameters. In certain embodiments, it is believed that
   the optimum aspect ratio for a fine glass filament is between 20
   and 40 times its length for use with certain VSFPLCs. So in
20 examples where the desired fibres are less than 1mm to optimise
   rheological/flow properties then a mean fibre length of
   approximately 900, 850, 800, 750,   700, 600, 500, 400, 300 or 250,
   microns may be selected depending on the fiber diameter. Typically
   such fibres may have a mean diameter somewhere between 5 microns
25 and 20 microns diameter. As disclosed herein, other mean fibre
   lengths or ranges and/or diameters or ranges of diameters may be
   used. In certain embodiments, it may be desirable that the fibres
   used have a surface substantially free of surface contaminations.
   In certain applications, to activate the surface of fibres it may
30 be desirable to boil them in clean water buffered at between pH8-9
   for approximately 10 minutes. In certain embodiments,
   substantially coating the fibres in silane coupling agents may be
   undertaken. However silane coatings may be catalytic with respect
   to free radical polymerisation of UP resin solutions. Typically,
35 the more thoroughly the fibre is coated with silane the stronger
   its catalytic affect.
        With respect to catalytic surface modification, the aim is to

                                  -  55
   reduce the crosslinking density at the interphase by reducing the
   catalytic effect of the filament surface. This may be accomplished
   with, for example, monomer deficient viscous resins, water,
   hindered phenols, hindered amines, other free radical scavengers
 5 or combinations thereof. It may be desirable in certain
   embodiments, to keep these compounds at the fibre/ filament
   surface during a VSFPLCs life as a liquid. One way of
   accomplishing this is to mix the VSFPLC fibre into the resin just
   prior to commencing the curing reaction. Another way is to modify
10 the surface of the fibre so that the chemicals that reduce
   crosslinking stay associated with the filament after mixing into
   the resin.
   Below are some non-limiting examples of modifying solutions that
15 reduce the crosslinking density:

        The above modifying/hydrogen bonding solutions are
   representative of polyfunctional and difunctional alcohols that
35 can be used with silanes to coat silaceous surfaces and render
   them hydrophilic, according to certain embodiments.
        Adding Coupling Agent to fibres:

                                    - 57
      a) Sieve fibres through a 1mm screen. In these embodiments, do
         not sieve for more than about 30 seconds. It should be noted
         that longer fibres may pass through a 1mm screen. Discard the
         oversize, and keep what falls through. The aim is to separate
 5       fibres less than 1mm from the longer fibres. Sieve about 80
         grams at a time until you have enough fibres for your
         testing. For example, sieving between 800 grams and 1.2Kg at
         a time is acceptable for these illustrative experiments.
         Other ways to obtain the appropriate fibres may also be used.
10    b) Boil the sieved fibres in water buffered at between pH8-9 for
         about 10 minutes to remove contamination from the surface
         Z6030  (this process is optional depending on the particular
         fibres being tested).
      c) Pour off the hot water and add about 6 litres of water and 20
15       grams of Z6030 or Z6032, or Dynasylan MEMO
      d) Mix thoroughly for five minutes and then add 50 ml of acrylic
         acid and stir for 1 hour. Then add 40g of hydrolysing
         solution and mix for about 45 minutes until the hydrolysing
         solution actually hydrolyses and reacts with the fibre
20       surface. This is done at   250C.
      e) Thereafter, drain off the solution and centrifuge the fibre.
         Form a bed of fibres on a tray about 10mm thick. Place a
         thermocouple in the fibres in the tray such that the sensing
         element is about 5mm below the surface of the fibres. Heat
25       the fibres in an oven until the thermocouple reads 1230C.
         Hold it at this temperature for 5 minutes and then allow it
         to cool in a fan forced oven to room temperature. These are
         coupled fibres with a hydrophilic surface capable of entering
         into free radical polymerisation with components of the
30       matrix resin.
         Emulsions are prepared from low monomer content UP resins,
   preferably with saturated acid to unsaturated acid ratios greater
   than 1:1 on a mole fraction basis. Water resin emulsions typically
35 add between 0.2%   and 0.4% by weight of water to the hydrophylic
   surface of the fibres. These emulsions are used to coat fibres
   prior to them being added to the matrix resin. One aim of the
   emulsion is to loosely bond water to the hydrophylic surface of

                                  - 58
   the fibre. The water is released from the fibre during exotherm
   reducing the cross-linking density in the interphase during the
   curing reaction.
 5      Thereafter, compound 5 grams of emulsion with 36 grams of
   coupled glass and compound until they are thoroughly mixed and the
   filaments are coated. These fibres are now ready to go into resins
   to make liquid composites.
10      VSFPLCs are different to long fibre composites. Typically,
   long fibre composites are composites made with at least 90%  of the
   fibres in the composite, on a weight basis, being longer than 2mm.
   In contrast, certain VSFPLC embodiments typically have 95%  of
   fibres <1mm on a weight basis. In certain embodiments, the fibres
15 used in VSFPLCs are so short, such that it is necessary to reduce
   the critical fibre length to typically less than 0.2mm. In other
   embodiments, the fibres used have a critical fibre length less
   than or equal to 0.1mm. In other embodiments, the critical fibre
   length may be less than or equal to 0.4mm, 0.3mm, 0.25mm, 0.15mm,
20 or 0.075mm. This results in the need for chemical bonding of the
   resin to the fibres. In these embodiments, reducing the critical
   fibre length is useful in order to impart significant stress into
   these very short fibres. This represents a radical departure from
   the resin to glass interphase in typical long fibre laminates. In
25 typical long fibre laminates most of the interaction between resin
   and glass is frictional interaction and the critical fibre length
   of these fibres is typically greater than 2mm. In other words, in
   typical long fibre laminates, there is a gap/discontinuity between
   the resin matrix and the fibre. Cracks that form in typical long
30 fibre composite resin matrices are arrested at this surface.
   Certain embodiments of the disclosed VSFPLCs do not have this
   gap/discontinuity, hence their inherent tendency to brittle
   failure. This tendency to brittleness comes from cracks initiating
   in the resin and travelling to the glass surface as a crack not a
35 craze. Because the resin in certain VSFPLC embodiments are
   intimately chemically bonded to the glass, the energy driving the
   propagation of the crack is focused at a point on the fibre, and
   the fibre ruptures allowing the crack to propagate through the

                                   - 59
   fibre unhindered. Typically, there is a minimum net thickness of
   resin coating a substantially portions of the fibres, in order for
   the majority of crazes to be "stabilized" before they reach a
   fibre surface.
 5
        Exemplary, commercially available resins that provide the
   required properties for use in VSFPLCs are moderately high
   molecular weight bisphenol based epoxy vinyl ester resins with
   monomer  (styrene) contents below 35%. With such low monomer
10 contents these resins tend to be more viscous in the liquid state.
   They are not ideal resins in certain embodiments, but they can be
   used in VSFPLC formulations if impact resistance of the final
   product is of less concern. For certain high impact resistance,
   VSFPLCs need a more flexible blended resin with a more resilient
15 UP and less VE resin. Other resins and methods for synthesizing UP
   and VE resins which are suited for use in VSFPLCs, according to
   certain embodiments are disclosed herein. For example, monomer
   deficient VE resins may be modified by adding reactive oligomers
   of the appropriate molecular shape,    such that the blends are more
20 suitable as VSFPLC resins. One such oligomers blend is a 50/50
   mixture of CHDM CHDA oligomer diacrylate with terephthalic acid
   HPHP oligomer diacrylate, added as a 15% addition to the monomer
   deficient resins. This addition increases the yield stress by
   approximately 12%  and elongation at peak load by up to
25 approximately 50%.
   COUPLING AGENTS
        The coupling agent may be selected from a variety of coupling
30 agents. In certain embodiments, the coupling agent comprises a
   plurality of molecules, each having a first end adapted to bond to
   the fibre and a second end adapted to bond to the resin when
   cured. An exemplary coupling agent is Dow Z-6030
   (methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane). Other exemplary coupling
35 agents are Dow Z-6032, and Z-6075    (vinyl triacetoxy silane) and

15 composition may vary. In certain embodiments, the coupling agent
   composition is present between 0.5 to 5 wt.%     of the weight of
   fibres in the composite. In other embodiments, the coupling agent
   composition is present between 0.5 to 1.5 wt.%,     1 to 3 wt.%,  0.5
   to 2 wt.%  or in other suitable weight percentage ranges of the
20 weight of fibres in the composite.
   RESIN AND POLYESTER COMPONENTS
        In certain embodiments, VSFPLCs made with toughened Vinyl
25 Ester and Polyester resins can be used as alternatives to
   thermoplastics. For example, such embodiments are useful in small
   to medium runs in injection moulding applications. Certain

   footing, or substantially equal footing, where strength is one of
30 the selection factors if the fibre coating and resin systems are
   optimized.
        Certain embodiments also relate to methods for producing
   thermoset resins suitable for use in VSFPLCs wherein the length of
35 the surface treated, reinforcing fibres are kept very short so
   that they do not substantially increase the viscosity of the
   liquid composite. In some aspects this can be characterized as

                                  - 61
   where the viscosity is such that the resin-fibre mixture is
   sprayable and/or pumpable.

   with each other, other suitable unsaturated polyester resins, VE
   resins, or combinations thereof to obtain resin formulations with
   selected desirable properties. Certain aspects are directed to
   resins that produce cured composites which sufficiently inhibit
25 crack propagation by stabilizing the craze zone ahead of the
   propagating crack. These resins can be further modified with
   polyester acrylates, butadiene acrylates, methacrylates, other UP
   resins or combinations thereof. Certain aspects are directed to
   produce resins that are tough, resist crack propagation, have
30 flexural strengths equal to, or greater than 70, 80,  90, 100, 110,
   120, 130, 140 or 150 MPa.

                                  - 69

   third polyester segment may have a molecular weight of 1,400
   Daltons or more, for example 1,400-10,000 Daltons. The third
   polyester segment may have a polydipersity index   (PDI) between 1

        In certain embodiments, the resin composition may have a
10 molecular weight of between 3,000 and 15,000 Daltons. In other
   embodiments, the resins composition may have a molecular weight of
   between 2,500 and 25,000 Daltons, 4,000 to 17,000 Daltons, 3,000

        In certain VSFPLCs, the bulk resin may be formulated to
   produce sufficiently strong fibrils in the craze zone when the
   bulk resin ruptures to stabilize the craze ahead of a crack
   preventing it from propogating. It is desirable that these fibrils
20 be sufficiently strong such that they are capable of sufficiently
   stabilizing, substantially stabilizing or stabilizing the craze
   zones ahead of cracks and to inhibit these cracks from
   propagating. In certain embodiments, the resin fraction is the
   dominant factor in determining certain bulk properties in VSFPLCs.
25 In certain embodiments, it is desirable that there is sufficient
   volume of resin around each fibre such that the composite is
   capable of stabilizing the craze zone ahead of a propagating
   crack. The stabilizing of the craze zone reduces the destructive
   energy reaching the interphase and ultimately the fibre surface.
30 In certain embodiments, the resin fraction may be 50%,   60%, 70%,
   80%, 90%, or 95% of the total weight of the composite. In certain
   embodiments, the resin fraction may be between 50 to 95%,   60 to
   85%, 50 to 80%, 50 to 60%, 70 to 95%, 80 to 95%  or 90 to 95%   of
   the total weight of the composite. In certain embodiments, it is
35 desirable that sufficient volume of resin be present such that a
   substantial portion of the fibres are substantially surrounded by
   resin. In certain embodiments, it is desirable that sufficient
   volume of resin be present such that a substantial portion of the

                                    - 70
   fibres are substantially surround by resin and the composite is
   capable of substantially stabilizing, sufficiently stabilizing or
   stabilizing a substantial portion of the craze zones found in the
   composite ahead of crack propagation.
 5
         As discussed herein, the tendency to brittleness in certain
   VSFPLCs comes in part from cracks initiating in the resin and
   traveling to the glass surface as a crack not a craze. Because the
   resin in certain VSFPLCs are intimately chemically bonded to the
10 glass, a portion of the energy driving the propagation of the
   crack may be focused at a point on the fibre, and the fibre may
   rupture allowing the crack to propagate through the fibre.
         Therefore, in certain VSFPLCs selected properties of the
15 composites are related to the composition of the resin matrix.
   Therefore, in certain embodiments,     (where the volume fraction
   range of the fibres is 8 to 35%,    6 to 40%, 8 to 20%,      10 to 35%, 20
   to 50% as these  fractions leave the resins as the dominant volume
   and the filaments/fibres individually wetted) it may be desirable
20 that there is a minimum net thickness of resin coating on a
   substantially portion of the fibres in the composite in order for
   the majority of crazes to be stabilized before they reach a fibre
   surface. In certain embodiments the volume fraction lies between
   8% and 18% by volume for fibres in certain VSFPLCs.

   structures which may be used to produce unsaturated polyesters
   with desired properties, according to certain disclosed

30 be cooked in  a reactor under nitrogen in    a three,    or four stage
   cook,  according to certain embodiments. It      is also possible to use
   1, 2, 3, or 4 stages   (In a 4 stage  cook the unsaturated moieties
   may be removed from the 3rd stage into the     4 th stage) . In  certain
   embodiments, it is possible to use 3 or 4 stage cooks with
35 polyesters.  In these embodiments, care is taken during the cooking
   process to position, glycols, saturated acids, and unsaturated
   acids at particular positions in the growing polymer chain. These
   polyester resins are made from combinations of one or more of the

                                  - 71

   describes a three stage UP resin cook. The first stage effects,
   partially controls, or controls flex modulus and/or HDT. The
10 second stage effects, partially impacts, or imparts impact
   resistance and/or toughness. And the third stage effects,
   partially controls, or controls cross-linking density as the UP
   resin cures.
15      In certain embodiments, it is possible to do a 1 or 2 stage
   cook with vinyl esters.
        Vinyl functional monomers may be added during the cooling
   process when the cook is substantially completed to adjust
20 viscosity and/or assist in the crosslinking reactions during final
   curing. The choice and quantity of reactive diluents may affect
   the properties of the cured resin. The reactive diluents may be
   selected from the following representative of classes of vinyl
   functional monomers or combinations thereof:  Styrene, Alpha Methyl
25 Styrene, methylmethacrylate monomer, ethylene glycol
   dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,6 hexanediol
   dimethacrylate, polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate, TMP
   trimethacrylate, ethoxylated bisphenol a dimethacrylate, CN9101

   acrylates and methacrylates can be used separately or in
 5 combinations. Typical additions are between 2 and 10%. For example
   a 2% addition of TMPTA increases the HDT of certain resins, for
   example, MIRteq's MIR100 resin from 510C to 620C.
        In certain embodiments, a polyester resin may be suitable for
10 a closed moulding. The resin may used as a general purpose resin

15        As   discussed herein, many of the commercially available VE
   and UP resins do not have the desired resistance to crack
   propagation. The most common strategies for making UP resins more
   impact resistant, and increasing their tensile elongations are:
   1. Adding a saturated dicarboxilic acid such as adiptic acid to
20 reduce aromaticity;
   2. Reducing the proportion of unsaturated acids in the formula;
   3. Using high molecular weight and/or branched diols in the
   formula;     and/or

                                  - 80
   4. Adding a plasticizer such as a phthalic acid or adiptic acid
   esters, or combinations thereof.
        These approaches, on their own, or in concert, produce UP
 5 resins with low mechanical strength, and low HDTs. As disclosed
   herein, in certain embodiments, the properties of VSFPLCs may be
   dependent on the properties of the bulk resin, the known
   approaches for improving tensile elongation and impact resistance
   of UP resins therefore may not be appropriate for VSFPLC
10 formulations.
        The present disclosure provides resins and methods for
   producing resins that have the needed toughness, and/or resistance
   to crack propagation. In certain embodiments, the disclosed resins
15 create a balance between aromatic and cycloaliphatic structures to
   modify molecular interactions and crystalinity. The present
   disclosure also discloses using blends of long and short chain
   diols, branched or non-branched to reduce crystalinity and other
   molecular associations.
20
        On top of the selection of molecular building blocks, the
   esterification reactions are carried out in two or preferably
   three or more stages to position moieties at specific locations in
   the growing polyester. The end result being tailor made UP resins
25 with specific molecular structures. These UP resins are blended to
   obtain UP resin formulations with desirable properties. One of the
   aims in the development of these resins is to produce cured
   composites which inhibit crack propagation by stabilizing the
   craze zone ahead of the "propagating" crack. These resins can be
30 further modified with polyester acrylates and or methacrylates.
   Certain embodiments, disclose resins that are tough and/or resist
   crack propagation and have flexural strengths between 75 MPa and
   120 MPa.
35      Table 3 lists a small sample of exemplary resins to
   illustrate the type of molecular engineering necessary to produce
   suitably tough resins for use in certain VSFPLC formulations.

                                  - 81
        Commercially available UP resins have vinyl groups randomly
   positioned throughout the molecule.
        No resin currently sold in the market is optimized to deliver
 5 the desired combination of properties. The resin backbone needs to
   be constructed/synthesized in ways to express the desired
   properties of all the subgroups in the molecules.
        A single stage cook guarantees that the unsaturated moieties
10 (vinyl groups) will be randomly distributed in the molecule
   adversely affecting properties. Two stage cooks are a better
   option but they limit the distance apart of the vinyl groups. Also
   vinyl groups are not necessarily positioned at the ends of the
   molecule but randomly scattered through the second stage. This
15 leads to reduce expression of the contribution of the building
   blocks in the resin not associated with crosslinking. Two stage
   cooked resins are may be acceptable for blending resins but may
   not be desirable for certain applications. Two stage cooks have
   to, by their very nature, sacrifice HDT for elongation. This is
20 not desirable for a VSFPLC. In two stage cooks we have to increase
   the ratio of saturated to unsaturated ac ids to achieve a given
   elongation.
        This leads to a lower HDT for a given elongation. A  slight
25 improvement in HDT can be achieved with these resins by adding a
   small percentage of polyfunctional alcohol in the second stage
   esterification and by incorporating small quantities of di, tri,
   and tetra functional vinyl monomers in the monomer mix during the
   "let down" process when functional monomers are added to the
30 polyester.
        With respect to three stage cooks,  disclosed herein resin
   structures require a multi stage esterification. This may be
   broken down to high and low HDT variants  (high HDT is greater than
35 700C and low HDT is less than 700C.) The high HDTS may have a
   central core dominated by aromatic compounds and other cyclic
   compounds. Low HDT variants may have a low aromatic content in the
   growing polyester.

                                  - 82
        Disclosed in Figure 1 and in Figure 13 are exemplary ways to
   create suitable UP resins for use with certain VSFPLCs. One of the
   aims in synthesizing these exemplary resins is to maximize HDT and
 5 achieve tensile elongations greater than 7%. Other tensile
   elongations may be used as disclosed herein. Stage 1. In Stage 1
   the aromatic and cycloaliphatic dicarboxilic acids are esterified
   with low molecular weight glycols such as ethylene glycol,
   propylene glycol, MP Diol, or NPG, or combinations thereof. The
10 presence of these structures add stiffness to the growing
   polyester. For steric reasons it is desired that these structures
   are in the centre of the growing polyester. The higher the
   molecular weight of the first stage polyester the stiffer and the
   higher the HDT of the resulting unsaturated polyester all other
15 stages being equal. The melt temperature during the first stage
   firstly stabilizes at 160 to 1750C for the first order
   polymerisation reaction to complete, then the temperature climbs
   to 190 to 2100C for completion of the second order reactions then
   the reactor is heated to 2250C until back end temperature starts
20 to fall. The power is then switched off and the flow of sparging
   gas is increased to strip out the last of the water and other
   volatiles and build a little more molecular weight.
        Stage 2. When the melt temperature drops below 1800C the
25 second stage reactor charge is added and the heating procedure is
   repeated. As previously mentioned this stage is dominated by
   strait and branched structures as these impart resilience,
   elongation and toughness.
30      Stage 3. Care is taken to add TBHQ at approximately 0.13% of
   the estimated melt weight to prevent gelling during the third
   stage cook. The last of the reactants are now added to the melt
   including the chemicals that contain the unsaturated moieties. The
   esterification is continued until the Acid Value of the melt drops
35 below 20mg/g KOH. The nitrogen sparge is then increased, the aim
   being to strip out any residual volatiles during the cooling
   process. The melt is then rapidly cooled to about 1200C. The melt
   is then let down with the reactive monomer/monomers and rapidly

                                         - 83
   cooled to room temperature. This process results in three useful
   outcomes. First, the aromatic/bulky moieties are in the centre of
   the polyester. Second, the moieties that supply elongation and
   resilience are substantially free from crosslinking and able
 5 express their property contributions. Third, the vinyl groups are
   positioned as sufficiently far apart allowing the rest of the
   molecule to contribute their properties to the UP unhindered by
   crosslinking. With respect to, high HDT variants these have a
   tight central core and lower saturated to unsaturated acid ratios,
10 i.e.,   4:3, 5:4,    6:5, 7:6, and 1:1. They may also include a small
   percentage of TMP or penta erithritol to create some crosslinking
   of the growing polymer. Typically, these are effective when
   incorporated in the first stage of the cooking.
15       Stage 1 is where aromatic and cyclo aliphatic acids/glycols
   are used. The presence of these structures adds stiffness to the
   growing molecule. For steric reasons it desirable that these
   structures are in the center of the molecule. The higher the
   molecular weight of this         first stage polymerization the stiffer
20 the molecule all other things being equal. The more linear the
   structure of the growing molecule the stiffer the resultant
   molecule-again all other things being equal. As the percentage
   molecular weight of this         first stage grows so does the stiffness
   increase and the HDT increases. It is a combination of structure
25 and mole percentage that effects, partially controls or controls
   the influence of this portion of the polyester on the properties
   of the finished UP molecules. Below are some examples of three
   Stage cooks.

30       The HDT of examples 2, 3, and 4 above are typically much
   higher than flexible resins available in the market today. This is
   partly due to a small 0.5 Molar addition of TMP in the primary
   cook and 2% TMPTA in the monomer package.
35       Figure 17,    Figure 18 and Figure 19 depict the volume of
   strained fibres for a brittle panel versus less brittle panels.
   Figure 17 illustrates a low elongation panel the instance before
   rupture. It is estimated that for this brittle panel there are
   approximately 1,500 fibres bearing load. Figure 18 illustrates a
40 moderate elongation panel the instance before rupture.                         It is
   estimated that    for this panel there are approximately 4,150 fibres
   bearing load, which is far stronger than the 1,500 fibre panel.
   Figure 19 illustrates a high elongation panel the instance before
   rupture. It is estimated that for this panel there are

                                          -  85
   approximately 6,090 fibres bearing load. These Figures confirm
   that the 6,090     fibre panel carries more load than the 4,150 fibre
   panel and significantly more load than 1,500 fibre panel. The more
   resilient the matrix resin is the more fibres are implicated in
 5 bearing the load as the panel deflects more and more. This is why
   in certain VSFPLCs it is desirable to use resins with high
   elongation. The stiffer the resin, the more load is required to
   deflect a panel a given distance. Certain VSFPLCs require as high
   a flexural modulus resilient resin as it can utilize. Such resins
10 are not available because they are not required for composites
   whose mean fibre length is many times the critical fibre length.
          In certain embodiments, it is possible to blend existing
   commercial resins to create resin blends that have suitable
15 properties for use in the formulation of certain VSFPLCs. Below
   are some examples of blended resins that are suitable for use with
   certain VSFPLCs.

          In Table 7, resin Dion 9800 is a urethane modified vinyl
   ester resin available from Reichhold Industries, Inc.'s North
   Carolina, USA. Resin Dion 9600 is a flexible, tough vinyl ester
 5 resin available from Reichhold Industries, Inc.'s North Carolina,
   USA. Resin Dion 31038 also known as Dion@ 31038-00 is a urethane
   modified vinyl ester resin available from Reichhold Industries,
   Inc.'s North Carolina, USA.
10        Additional blends of vinyl ester resins may be produced
   according to certain embodiments, by blending Dion 9600              (which is
   a flexible, tough vinyl ester resin) with Dion 9400. The HDT of
   Dion 9600 is too low for many applications, however, blending a
   certain portion of Dion 9400 novolac vinyl ester resin with the
15 Dion 9600 improves both yield stress and HDT. The resins can be
   blended in the following ratios 5% Dion 9400 in 95%             Dion 9600, 10%
   Dion 9400 in 90%     Dion 9600, 15%   in Dion 9400    in 85%    Dion 9600, or
   20%   in Dion 9400 in 80% Dion 9600. These blends retain adequate
   elongation with increasing HDT. Dion 9600 is a flexible, tough
20 vinyl ester resin available from Reichhold Industries, Inc.'s
   North Carolina, USA. Dion@ 9400 is a non-accelerated, novolac
   epoxy based vinyl ester resin available from Reichhold Industries,
   Inc.'s North Carolina, USA.
25        Using certain disclosed embodiments, the resins and/or resin
   fibre composites disclosed herein can improve one or more of the

                                  -  89
   following properties: tensile yield stress, tensile elongation,
   flexural elongation and/or toughness    (Izod impact strength) by a
   minimum of 10% over known similar resin-fibre composites.    In
   certain embodiments, these properties may be improved by at least
 5 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or 50% over known similar resin-fibre
   composites and sometimes as much as 35 to 50%    for energy to
   rupture/failure.
        As illustrated by this example Dion 9600 LC has the following
10 properties flexural strength 81MPa, flex elongation 5.8%, flexural
   modulus 3.lGPa, and required 3.6 Joules to rupture a standard
   panel. Dion 9600 + 12%  Dion 9400 flexural strength was 90MPa, flex
   elongation was 6.9% flex modulus was 3.4GPa and required 5.6
   Joules to rupture a standard panel. This represented a 33%
15 increase in elongation and 56%   increase in the energy required to
   rupture a standard panel. Thus, blending off the shelf resins may
   improve the properties of resins for use in certain VSFPLCs,
   according to certain embodiments.
20      The molecular structure of unsaturated polyester and vinyl
   ester resins may determine certain properties of the cured resin.
   For example, with respect to vinyl ester resins as discussed
   herein, more particularly visphenol-A epoxy vinyl ester resins.
   However, this discussion may be also applicable to unsaturated
25 polyester resins, acrylic resins, epoxy resins, urethane resins,
   or combinations thereof. When resins solidify either as a result
   of a curing reaction as in the case of thermosets or due to a
   dramatic lowering of temperature as in the case of thermoplastic
   resins adjacent molecules or associations. If these associations
30 are strong and regular in parts of the molecular structure, then
   'zones of crystalinity' may be formed. These zones of crystalinity
   contribute to the polymer becoming more rigid and/or stiff.
        In certain embodiments, these zones may have varying degrees
35 of distinctness. In certain embodiments, in order to attempt to
   influence certain properties the resin formula may be formulated
   to increase rigidity  (i.e. crystalinity) and add plasticisers in
   sufficient quantities to give the desired bulk properties.

                                  -   90
        For example, certain plasticisers may be characterized as
   more reactive plasticers and less reactive plasticers.
 5      In certain embodiments, unsaturated polyesters resins and/or
   vinyl ester resins may function as plasticers. In certain
   embodiments, adding very flexible unsaturated polyester resins
   and/or vinyl ester resins to much stiffer resins may result in
   more flexible resin mixtures.
10
        In certain embodiments, resins whose molecular structure
   interferes with the ability of the base resin to form zones of
   crystalinity and/or strong intermolecular associations may be
   added to resin mixtures. These additives may not follow the Law of
15 Mixtures and can have a profound effect on the properties of the
   resin blend when added, for example, in the range 3 -   15%. This
   may be described in general terms as alloying resins. Other ranges
   may also be used as disclosed herein.
20      Example 5. Reichhold Dion 9600 plus 13%   Dion 9400. This
   example is a good illustration of alloying as Dion 9400 is a
   novolac vinyl ester resin with a low elongation in its own right
   but when added at between 12 -   13 to Dion 9600 it significantly
   increases elongation and toughness of the resin when used in
