Title
 IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION METHOD AND SYSTEM BASED
                         ON KEYSTROKE BEHAVIORS

     The present invention relates to the field of Internet, in particular to an identity
authentication method and system based on keystroke behaviors.
Description of Related Arts
     With the rapid development of Internet, the user requirements on the security of
accounts in the Internet are increased accordingly. At present, the mostly common
method is text matching identity authentication based on username and password
combination. Although this method is simple and feasible, once the password is
leaked, this identity authentication method will fail. Since behaviors of each person
have its biological features, keystroke behaviors of users have a connection with ages
and genders of users, familiarity with computer keyboards and the like, and keystroke
behavior patterns of different users are difficult to be imitated and embezzled by
others. In addition, the authentication method based on keystroke behaviors does not
need additional hardware supports, the cost is comparatively low and a system can
record keystroke behaviors of users at background. Therefore, the authentication
method based on keystroke behaviors of users has good feasibility. However, the
authentication method based on traditional keystroke behaviors cannot confirm
legality of user identity in real time.

      As illustrated in FIG. 1, the present invention provides an identity authentication
method based on keystroke behaviors, comprising following steps:Sl, establishing a
user model of legal user keystroke characteristics according to legal keystroke
behaviors during trainnig of legal user;S2, acquiring to-be-estimated keystroke
behaviors during keystroke of a logged-in user and generating a to-be-estimated
keystroke    time   sequence;S3,    generating   a  to-be-estimated    extremely-adjacent
character sequence according to the to-be-estimated keystroke time sequence; and S4,
matching the to-be-estimated extremely-adjacent character sequence with the user
model and judging whether the to-be-estimated keystroke behaviors of the logged-in
user are legal according to a matching result; and if the to-be-estimated keystroke
behaviors are illegal, generating a warning and requiring the logged-in user to log in
again, and if the to-be-estimated keystroke behaviors are legal, allowing the logged-in

                                              8
user to log in, simultaneously storing the to-be-estimated keystroke behaviors and
updating the user model.
      After a user logs in a web account, a monitor will track keystroke behaviors of
the user in real time and record a keystroke behavior time sequence of the user. At a
training stage of a user model, all keystroke behaviors at a use stage of the user
account are acquired and data are sent after the user account logs out.
      The keystroke behavior time sequence of the user is shown in Table 1. Table 1 is
a log table of user keystroke behaviors, wherein down indicates that a key is pressed
down, up indicates that a key bounces, and Time indicates a timestamp when a key is
pressed down or bounces.
              down                              up                       Time (ms)

                                             Table 1
      When extracting characteristics, firstly an uploaded keystroke behavior log is
processed to extract a time interval vector of user keystrokes. At the training stage of
the user model, a characteristic value Interval=<1, 12...I, > of the time interval vector
needs to be iterated, so as to excavate a critical time interval a which reflects user
keystroke characteristics and       further excavate an extremely-adjacent       character
sequence of the user according to the characteristics.
      Thus, as illustrated in FIG. 2, step SI further comprises the following steps:

                                               9
      S11, acquiring legal keystroke behaviors and generating a legal time interval
vector;
      S12, traversing the legal time interval vector and judging whether a time interval
between two adjacent character sequences of the legal time interval vector is smaller
than a preset critical time interval; traversing values in the time interval characteristic
vector Interval=<1, 12...],->;
      if yes, setting the two adjacent characters to be the same one extremely-adjacent
character; and
      if not, generating a new extremely-adjacent character by using a last character of
the two adjacent characters as a first character;
      S13, calculating proportions of the extremely-adjacent characters containing two
and three characters and setting the preset critical time interval corresponding to a
maximum proportion to be a legal critical time interval; and
      S14, generating a legal extremely-adjacent character sequence again through the
legal critical time interval and recording a duration of the legal extremely-adjacent
character sequence.
      Extracted extremely-adjacent character sequences are shown in Table 2. Table 2
is a table of a time characteristic set of extremely-adjacent character sequences.
Extremely-adjacent character sequence            Duration/ms

      Preferably, the step of establishing the user model of legal user keystroke
characteristics further comprises the following steps: extracting a time characteristic
set of the legal extremely-adjacent character sequence and establishing a distribution
model with which the legal extremely-adjacent character sequence complies.

                                              10
      Preferably, as illustrated in FIG. 3, step S3 further comprises the following steps:
      S3 1, acquiring the to-be-estimated keystroke behaviors;
      S32, generating a to-be-estimated time interval vector of the to-be-estimated
keystroke behaviors; and
      S33, generating the to-be-estimated extremely-adjacent character sequence
through combining the legal critical time interval with the to-be-estimated time
interval vector.
      For one user, it is supposed that the duration that the user inputs the
extremely-adjacent character sequence complies with a normal distribution process.
An extraction module excavates a time characteristic set of the extremely-adjacent
character sequence and establishes a normal distribution model with which each
extremely-adjacent character sequence complies. For a time characteristic set <S1, S2,
S3... Sk-1, Sk> of an extremely-adjacent character sequence S, expectation and
variance are calculated by using a maximum likelihood estimation method, wherein
                        k          %
                  2         S        2
 A       S
        k                   k-1        .  The extremely-adjacent     character  sequences
obtained by excavating the training data of the legal user and normal distribution
models with which the extremely-adjacent character sequences comply form main
parts of the user model, and the critical time interval, which is a user keystroke
characteristic, is also a part of the user model.
      By matching the to-be-estimated keystroke behavior data with the user model,
scores of the to-be-estimated keystroke behavior data are given and authentication
results are given according to a decision-making algorithm. When the authentication
results indicate that the keystroke behavior data belong to a legal user, this module
stores the time characteristic set of the extremely-adjacent character sequence
excavated from the to-be-estimated data at a current time into a buffer zone, and when
the number of the to-be-estimated characteristics reaches a preset value, the model of

                                            II
the corresponding extremely-adjacent character sequence in a model database is
updated.
      Further, step 52 further comprises the following step:
      acquiring    the   to-be-estimated   keystroke    time  sequence.    storing   the
to-be-estimated keystroke time sequence into a buffer zone with a preset size, and
when the buffer zone is full, all the to-be-estimated keystroke time sequences in the
buffer zone are sent. At a continuous authentication stage of the user identity, a data
acquisition module sets a character sequence buffer zone with a fixed size, and when
the buffer zone is full, the acquisition module submits the data in the buffer zone to a
characteristic extraction module to perform identity authentication. In this example,
the magnitude ofa window value ofthe buffer zone is 30 characters.
      Preferably, Gaussian probability density function is a similarity evaluation
function and is used for evaluating a similarity between the to-be-estimated
extreimely-adjacent character sequence and the extremely-adjacent character sequence
in the user model during user authentication. In step S            the to-be-estimated
extremely-adjacent character sequence is mached with the user model through a
Gaussian model according to the following scoring formula:
                                                  (ts,-ps),
                                   SGPD =e           25
      wherein tc indicates a to-be-estimated extremely-adjacent character sequence,
and p, and S. ae respectively expectation and standard difference of Gaussian
distribution in the Gaussian model.
      As illustrated in FIG. 4, the step of judging whether the to-be-estimated
keystroke behaviors ofthe logged-in user am legal further comprises:
      calculating a score of each to-be-estimated extremely-adjacent character
sequence. removing scres which are lower han a preset value, summing the scores
and judging whether the summed scores are greater than a theshold; ifyes, allowing

                                           12
the user to log in, simultaneously storing the to-be-estimated keystroke behaviors and
updating the user model; and if not, giving a warning and requiring the user to log in
again.
     As illustrated in FIG. 5, the present invention further provides an identity
authentication system based on keystroke behaviors, comprisinga data acquisition
module, a characteristic extraction module, a model training module, a continuous
authentication model and a model database.
     The data acquisition module is used for acquiring a legal keystroke time
sequence generated according to legal keystroke behaviors of a legal user and a
to-be-estimated keystroke time sequence generated according to to-be-estimated
keystroke behaviors during keystroke of a logged-in user, and sending the legal
keystroke time sequence and the to-be-estimated keystroke time sequence to the
characteristic extraction module.
     The characteristic extraction module is used for respectively and correspondingly
generating a legal extremely-adjacent character sequence and a to-be-estimated
extremely-adjacent character sequence according to the legal keystroke time sequence
and the to-be-estimated keystroke time sequence.
     The model training module is used for establishing a user model of legal user
keystroke characteristics according to the legal keystroke behaviors and the legal
keystroke time sequence.
     The continuous authentication module is used for matching the to-be-estimated
extremely-adjacent character sequence with the user model and judging whether the
to-be-estimated keystroke behaviors of the logged-in user are legal according to a
matching result; if not, generating awarning and requiring the logged-in user to log in
again; and yes, allowing the logged-in user to log in, simultaneously storing the
to-be-estimated keystroke behaviors and giving a feedback to the model training
moduleto update the user model.
     The model database is used for storing the user model of legal user keystroke

                                              13
characteristics.
      Preferably, the data acquisition module is further used for acquiring legal
keystroke behaviors and generating a legal time interval vector;
      the characteristic extraction module is further used for traversing the legal time
interval vector and generating extremely-adjacent characters according to a time
interval between two adjacent character sequences of the legal time interval vector
and     a preset critical time interval; calculating proportions of the extremely-adjacent
characters containing two and three characters and setting the preset critical time
interval corresponding to a maximum proportion to be a legal critical time interval;
and generating a legal extremely-adjacent character sequence again through the legal

      the characteristic extraction module is further used for extracting a time
characteristic set of the legal extremely-adjacent character sequence and establishing a
distribution model with which the legal extremely-adjacent character sequence
complies.
      Preferably, the characteristic extraction module is further used for generating a
to-be-estimated time interval vector of the to-be-estimated keystroke behaviors; and
generating the to-be-estimated extremely-adjacent character sequence in combination
with the legal critical time interval and the to-be-estimated time interval vector.
      Preferably, the characteristic extraction module is further used for acquiring the
to-be-estimated keystroke time sequence, storing the to-be-estimated keystroke time
sequence into a buffer zone with a preset size, and when the buffer zone is full,
sending all to-be-estimated keystroke time sequences in the buffer zone.
      A user keystroke behavior authentication method is executed mainly by a data
acquisition module, a characteristic extraction module, a model training module and a
continuous authentication module. The data acquisition module is responsible for
acquiring a keystroke time sequence during keystroke of a user; the characteristic

                                             14
extraction module is responsible for mining an extremely-adjacent character sequence
of the user; the model training module is responsible for establishing a Gaussian
model of user keystroke characteristics according to time characteristics of training
data of a legal user; and the continuous authentication module is responsible for
performing decision-making scoring according to a segment of character sequence
keyed in by the user to judge the legality of the user identity, simultaneously storing
keystroke behavior characteristics of the legal user in a recent time period, and when
the number of the characteristics satisfies certain conditions, using the new
characteristics to establish a model and updating the corresponding sequence model in
the model database.
      Data acquisition module: after a user logs in a web account, a monitor will track
keystroke behaviors of the user in real time and record a keystroke behavior time
sequence of the user. At a training stage of a user model, the data acquisition module
will acquire all keystroke behaviors at a use stage of the user account and send data to
the characteristic extraction module after the user account logs out.At a continuous
authentication stage of the user identity, the data acquisition module sets a character
sequence buffer zone with a fixed size, and when the buffer zone is full, the
acquisition module submits the data in the buffer zone to the characteristic extraction
module to perform identity authentication. In this example, the size of a window value
of the buffer zone is 30 characters.
      Characteristic extraction module: this module firstly processes an uploaded
keystroke behavior log to extract a time interval vector of user keystrokes. At the
training stage of the user model, the characteristic extraction module needs to iterate a
characteristic value Interval=<1,  12... I-> of the time interval vector so as to excavate
a critical time interval a which reflects user keystroke characteristics and further
excavate an extremely-adjacent character sequence of the user according to the
characteristics.
      Model training module: for one user, it is supposed that the duration that the user
inputs the extremely-adjacent character sequence complies with a normal distribution

                                           15
process. This model mines a time characteristic set of the extremely-adjacent
character sequence and establishes a normal distribution model with which each
extremely-adjacent character sequence complies. For a time characteristic set <S1, S2,
S3... Sk-1, Sk> of an extremely-adjacent character sequence S, expectation and
variance are calculated by using a maximum likelihood estimation method,
                       ~      AA
      wherein          k ,             k-1
      The extremely-adjacent character sequences obtained by mining the training data
of the legal user and normal distribution models with which the extremely-adjacent
character sequences comply form main parts of the user model, and the critical time
interval, which is a user keystroke characteristic, is also a part of the user model.
      Continuous authentication module: by matching the to-be-estimated keystroke
behavior data with the user model, this model gives scores of the to-be-estimated
keystroke    behavior    data   and  gives   authentication     results   according   to a
decision-making     algorithm. When the authentication results indicate that the
keystroke behavior data belong to the legal user, this module stores the time
characteristic set of the extremely-adjacent character sequence excavated from the
to-be-estimated data at a current time into a buffer zone, and when the number of the
to-be-estimated characteristics reaches a preset value, the model of the corresponding
extremely-adjacent character sequence in the model database is updated.
      Gaussian probability density function is a similarity evaluation function and is
used for evaluating a similarity between the to-be-estimated extremely-adjacent
character sequence and the extremely-adjacent character sequence in the user model
during user authentication. The following scoring formula is given according to the
Gaussian probability density function:
                                                  (ts,-s?9
                                                         2
                                   SGPD=      e        3

                                            16
      wherein t,, indicates an extremely-adjacent character sequence excavated from
to-be-estimated keystroke behavior data according to a critical time interval a of a
user, and ps and S, are respectively expectation and standard difference of Gaussian
distribution of a corresponding sequence in the Gaussian model.
      As illustrated in FIG. 6, in one embodiment of the present invention, an ROC
curve of authentication results obtained by using the identity authentication method
and system based on keystroke behaviors provided by the present invention indicates
that the authentication method and system provided by the present invention can
achieve a true acceptance rate highly reaching more than 90% under a situationthat a
false acceptance rate reaches 5.3%, can effectively judge the legality of the user
identity and can guarantee the security of user accounts.
      To sum up, since only a small number of representative keystroke characteristics
of users are extracted and a great number of redundant keystroke characteristic
sequences are removed in the present invention, the authentication accuracy is
guaranteed and simultaneously the response capability of continuous authentication is
improved; and since keystroke behaviors of users are monitored in real time when
users log in web accounts, continuous account security guarantees are provided for
users.
