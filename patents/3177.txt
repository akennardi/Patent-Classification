  CONSTRUCTION PANEL HAVING IMPROVED FIXING STRENGTH AND METHOD FOR
                                THE MANUFACTURE THEREOF
The present invention relates to panels for use in building construction and the manufacture
thereof. In particular, the present invention relates to panels for providing partitions to which
items such as sinks, televisions, or radiators may be affixed.
Light-weight panels such as plasterboard (e.g. gypsum plasterboard), polystyrene board and
fibreboard are commonly used to provide partitions within buildings. Their advantages for
this application include the fact that they are light and quick to install.
However, in certain cases, such light-weight panels may have the drawback that they are not
strong enough to support fixtures (e.g. sinks, televisions, radiators, fire extinguishers,
shelves and any other item that requires attachment to the panel). In such cases, the weight
of the fixture may cause the fixing means (e.g. screws) to be pulled out of the panel, such
that the fixture falls away from the partition.
Typically, this problem has been addressed by providing plywood sheets to increase the
fixing strength of the panel. In this case, the plywood sheet is provided on the side of the
panel opposite to that on which the fixture is to be located. The plywood sheet may provide
increased strength for retaining one or more fixing means (e.g. screws) employed to secure
the fixture to the panel. Typically, the plywood sheet is positioned within the partition
framework, and the plasterboard then fixed to the plywood, so that it lies outside the partition
framework.
As an alternative, metal support means may be provided. These may comprise fixing plates,
channels, straps, or metal fasteners. As is the case for plywood sheets, the metal support
                                                  1

    WO 2014/188168                                                           PCT/GB2014/051536
means are generally positioned on the side of the panel opposite that to which the fixture is
to be secured, and act to receive and secure fixing means, e.g. fixing screws, that are used
to attach the fixture to the panel.
Both these arrangements have the disadvantage that they require the panels and the
additional supporting components to be affixed to each other on-site. Moreover, when
metal support means are used, a plurality of such support means may be needed to support
the full set of fixing means required to secure the fixture to the panel. Thus, the installation
process may be time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, the addition of metal support means or plywood sheets increases the weight
and thickness of the partition, and/or results in a reduction in cavity wall space. In general,
the plywood itself must be cut to size on site, thus increasing the time required for installation
and possibly leading to the release of dust and potentially harmful components.
Therefore, there is a need to provide improved panels that are able to retain fixing means
and support fixtures, and that do not require time-consuming installation processes.
It has been found that by providing a panel comprising a substrate board having a polymer
based lamina secured to one of its faces, an improvement in the ability of the panel to retain
fixing means may be achieved. However, such panels may be susceptible to screw
overtightening, whereby even a small additional rotation of a screw after peak tightening
torque has been achieved may result in stripping of the inner surface of the screw hole, with
the result that the screw is no longer retained in the panel. As a result, it may be difficult to
insert screw fixings into the panel in a reliable and reproducible manner.
                                                 2

It has been found that, in the case where the substrate board is a gypsum plasterboard, this
problem may be reduced by selecting a plasterboard that includes at least a fibre additive.
Therefore, in a first aspect, the present invention may provide a panel comprising a
plasterboard, the plasterboard having a backing lamina attached to one of the faces thereof,
the plasterboard comprising a gypsum matrix having fibres embedded therein, in an amount
of at least 1 wt% relative to the gypsum.
Preferably, the lamina is a polymer-based lamina, typically comprising substantially a
material selected from the group comprising: PVC, HDPE, Nylon, polycarbonate, Bakelite,
polypropylene, acetal, and fibreglass.
Typically, the lamina has a thickness of at least 1 mm. In general, the lamina is glued to the
plasterboard, e.g. by means of a polymer-based glue, such as an acrylic glue.
Preferably, the gypsum matrix further comprises a starch additive in an amount of at least 1
wt% relative to the gypsum, preferably 2 wt%, more preferably 2.5 wt%.
Typically, the fibres are present in an amount of at least 2 wt% relative to the gypsum,
preferably 2.5 wt%
In general, the fibres are selected from a group comprising glass fibres, wood fibres, fibres
derived from wood, and mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, however, the fibres may
be synthetic polymer fibres.
                                                 3

    WO 2014/188168                                                          PCT/GB2014/051536
For example, the fibres may be regenerated cellulose fibres, such as lyocell, that are
manufactured from dissolved wood pulp. In this case, the fibres typically have one or more
of the following properties:
     *  an average length that is greater than 0.1 mm, preferably greater than 0.2 mm;
     *  an average length that is less than 0.5 mm, preferably less than 0.4 mm;
     *  an average diameter that is less than 20 micron, preferably less than 15 micron.
In certain embodiments, the fibres may be present within the plasterboard in the form of
particles of agglomerated fibres, for example, paper particles and/or wood particles (for
example, fine sawdust particles). In general, these particles are irregular in shape. The
particles typically have one or more of the following properties:
     *  their maximum dimension is preferably greater than 0.5 mm, preferably greater than
         1 mm, more preferably greater than 1.5 mm;
     " their maximum dimension is less than 3 mm, preferably less than 2.5 mm;
     "  the average length of the fibres within the particles is greater than 1 mm;
     *  the average length of the fibres within the particles is less than 15 mm;
     *  the average diameter of the fibres within the particles is greater than 1 micron,
        preferably greater than 5 micron;
     * the average diameter of the fibres within the particles is less than 50 micron,
        preferably less than 30 micron.
The fibres follow a convoluted path such that they are contained within the boundaries of the
particle.
Inthe case that the fibres are glass fibres, the fibres may have one or more of the following
properties:
      a an average length greater than 10 mm, preferably greater than 15 mm;
                                                 4

    WO 2014/188168                                                         PCT/GB2014/051536
     " an average length less than 50 mm, preferably less than 30 mm;
     " an average diameter greater than 20 micron, preferably greater than 30 micron;
     " an average diameter less than 80 micron, preferably less than 70 micron.
Preferably, the starch comprises a non-migratory starch, that is, a starch compound that is
retained within the core of the plasterboard and does not migrate to the board surface. Such
starches are distinguished from migratory starches, which typically migrate to the surface of
the plasterboard and serve the purpose of improving the bonding of the plasterboard core to
the paper facing. However, the plasterboard may additionally comprise such migratory
starches.
Non-migratory starches may be provided in a number of different ways, as is well-known in
the art. For example, the starch may comprise dextrin, as described in US7708847, which is
hereby incorporated by reference.
In other cases, the starch may be a pre-gelatinised starch.
In certain embodiments, the starch may be selected to have a low viscosity (e.g. a Brookfield
viscosity of less than 60 cps) at a temperature of less than 60*C, and a much higher
viscosity (e.g. a Brookfield viscosity of over 10000 cps) at a temperature of 70*C. Such
starches are described in e.g. US82521 10, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
These starches have a rheology that is strongly temperature-dependent: it is thought that, at
low temperatures, the starch may be dispersed in the core in order to penetrate into the
inter-crystalline spaces. As soon as the temperature is above 60 0C, the viscosity of the
starch increases rapidly up to a very high level to ensure that the starch actually remains in
the core and does not migrate to the core/facing interface.
                                                 5

    WO 2014/188168                                                           PCT/GB2014/051536
In certain embodiments, the starch is a substituted starch, such as described in US7048794,
which is hereby incorporated by reference. Substituted starches are starch derivatives that
have been chemically reacted to replace one or more of the hydroxyl functional groups.
Typically, the process involves etherification or esterification of a starch or modified starch
which appends ether or ester linkages along the starch polymer backbone. This process is
distinct from other modifications typically made to starches such as oxidization, acid
thinning, cross-linking, and pre-gelatinisation, although such processes may also be applied
to the starch, prior to or after substitution with one or more types of functionalities.
It is thought that substituted starches act as efficient binders for the inorganic phase of
plasterboards, e.g. gypsum, thus increasing the core strength of the plasterboard.
Preferably, the starch is insoluble in cold water, but dissolves at a higher processing
temperature during forming, setting, or drying of the plasterboard. This is thought to limit
excessive migration of the starch, so that it remains in the plasterboard core, to provide a
binder for the gypsum crystals.
The substituted starch may comprise hydroxyethylated, hydroxypropylated, and/or
acetylated starch. Preferably, the starch is a hydroxyethylated starch.
The starch may be derived from e.g. potato, tapioca, or corn. Preferably, the starch is
derived from corn.
In a second aspect, the present invention may provide a plasterboard comprising a gypsum
matrix, the gypsum matrix having fibres embedded therein, the fibres being present in an
amount of at least 1 wt% relative to the gypsum, the gypsum matrix further comprising a
polymeric additive, the polymeric additive being present in an amount of at least 1 wt%
relative to the gypsum.
                                                   6

    WO 2014/188168                                                           PCT/GB2014/051536
Preferably, the fibres are present in an amount of at least 3 wt% relative to the gypsum,
more preferably at least 4 wt%, most preferably at least 4.5 wt%. Preferably, the polymeric
additive is present in an amount of at least 3 wt% relative to the gypsum, more preferably at
least 4 wt%, most preferably at least 4.5 wt%. It is thought that these relatively high levels of
fibre and polymeric additive may provide the plasterboard with sufficient ability to retain fixing
means that no backing lamina is required.
By omitting a backing lamina, it may be possible to provide a panel having adequate fixing
strength at a relatively lower cost, due to reduced raw material costs and greater ease of
manufacture. Additionally, the panel may be easier to recycle, since the requirement to
separate the lamina from the plasterboard may be avoided.
Typically the polymeric additive is selected from group comprising polyvinyl acetate,
poly vinyl acetate-ethylene co-polymer, polyvinyl pyrrolidone crosslinked with polystyrene
sulfonate, polyvinyl alcohol, methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose, styrene
butadiene copolymer latex, acrylic ester latex, acrylic copolymer latex, polyester resin, epoxy
resin, polymethyl methacrylate, polyacrylic acid, cationic starch, ethylated starch, dextrin and
mixtures thereof.
In general, the polymeric additive is a starch.
Preferably, in the case that the starch is present at a level of at least 3 wt% relative to the
gypsum, the starch is a migratory starch. Surprisingly, it has been found that at these
relatively high starch contents, even a migratory starch will be retained within the
plasterboard core in sufficient amounts so as to enhance the fixing strength of the
plasterboard. At the same time, the migratory starch may aid in improving the bonding of the
plasterboard core to a paper facing (if used), so that there is no need to include multiple
starch varieties within the plasterboard.
                                                7

    WO 2014/188168                                                           PCT/GB2014/051536
Inthe case that the starch is present at a level of at least 3 wt% relative to the gypsum, it is
generally preferred that the starch is a native starch, rather than a pre-gelatinised starch. At
these relatively high starch levels, pre-gelatinised starch is considered to impart excessive
viscosity to the gypsum slurry.
Typically, the starch may be derived from e.g. wheat, corn, maize, or rice. At starch levels of
3 wt% or more relative to the gypsum, potato starch is less preferred, since its relatively
large grain size is considered to have a deleterious effect on water distribution within the
gypsum slurry.
Preferably, the fibres are glass fibres.
Preferably, in the case that the fibres are present at a level of at least 3 wt% relative to the
gypsum, the fibre length is less than 10 mm, more preferably less than 8 mm. It is thought
that longer fibres are difficult to process in these relatively large amounts within a gypsum
slurry. Typically, the fibre length is greater than 4 mm.
Typically, the fibre diameter is in the range 5-50 micron, preferably 10-30 micron, more
preferably 10-20 micron.
In certain embodiments, the fibres may be organic fibres, e.g. natural polymer fibres, such as
those derived from wood, or synthetic polymer fibres.
In certain embodiments, the plasterboard may contain silicone oil or wax and/or a biocide.
In general, the plasterboard has paper facings. However, in certain cases, the plasterboard
may have a mat partially or fully embedded at its surface, for example, a glass fibre mat,

which may be pre-coated. Additionally or alternatively, the plasterboard may have a
thermoplastic coating or a polymeric film (such as polyester) on one or more of its faces.
In a third aspect, the present invention may provide a method of manufacturing a
plasterboard according to the second aspect of the invention, comprising the step of adding
starch to a gypsum slurry, wherein the grain size of the starch is less than 40 micron.
Preferably, the grain size of the starch is less than 30 micron. It is thought that a large
starch grain size results in an uneven water distribution within the slurry, such that more
water is required overall.
In a fourth aspect, the present invention may provide a method of manufacturing a
plasterboard according to the second aspect of the invention, comprising the steps of adding
starch and fibre to a gypsum slurry, shaping the slurry to form a plasterboard and drying the
plasterboard at a temperature in the range 140-180*C.
The plasterboard manufactured through the methods of the third or fourth aspects of the
invention may have one or more of the optional features of the plasterboard according to the
second aspect of the invention.
The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the following

Quantification of resistance to overtightening
To quantify the resistance to overtightening of the panels of the Examples 1-3 and
Comparative Examples 1 and 2, a graph of torque against rotation angle was plotted for a
screw being inserted into each panel. The screw was a No. 10 woodscrew having a length
of 50 mm and a diameter of 5 mm. An example of such a graph is shown in Figure 1.
The area below the curve was then calculated between the rotation angle of zero
(corresponding to peak torque) and 7.85 radians. This area is considered to give an
indication of the work done in tightening the screw after peak torque has been attained. It is
thought that the greater the work done after peak torque has been attained, the lower the
risk of overtightening the screw and stripping material from the inner surface of the screw
hole.
The peak torque was also measured for each board. The results are set out in Table 1:

that the panel of Example 1 retains a higher torque (after peak torque has been attained)
than the panels of the Comparative Examples. This is considered to indicate an improved
ability of the panel to withstand stripping of a screw hole formed therein.
Impact tests
To quantify the impact resistance of plasterboard, a 500g steel ball having a diameter of 50
mm is dropped down a vertical 6 m pipe onto 200 mm x 200 mm sample of the board. The
sample is supported in a horizontal orientation on the rim of a drainage hopper. The
drainage hopper is generally cylindrical and is positioned such that its longitudinal axis
coincides with that of the pipe. The internal diameter of the drainage hopper is 115 mm and
the external diameter is 122 mm. There is at least 40 mm clearance between the top of the
hopper and the bottom of the pipe.
The depth of the indent produced in the board sample is measured and the results are set
out in Table 2:
