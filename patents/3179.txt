RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]              The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application 61/901,879,
filed November 8, 2013, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. This
disclosure also accompanies a divisional application of AU2014346449, the contents of which
are incorporated herein by reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]              The disclosure relates to a battery switch, and more specifically, a battery switch for a
low-voltage, direct-current (DC) electrical systems such as systems found on yachts, recreational
vehicles, trucks, and other vehicles.
BACKGROUND
[0003]              Vehicle systems such as yachts and recreational vehicles have become bigger; as such
their DC electrical systems have evolved to meet the increased electrical power demand.
Therefore, many of these electrical systems incorporate two banks of batteries. A first bank of
batteries may be used for starting the engine, as well as powering other necessary engine
functions, while a second bank of batteries may be isolated and used for powering non-engine
related functions, such as but not limited to, heating, cooling, water pump, television, and radio.
[0004]              Typically, such DC electrical systems are low-voltage, for example, six, twelve, or
twenty-four volts, however, because of the significant power requirements, the DC electrical
systems require high amperage conductors to be run throughout the vehicle.
SUMMARY
[0005]              An embodiment provides a battery switch configured to control a first bank of
batteries and a second bank of batteries, the first and second bank of batteries having at least one
battery. The battery switch may include a housing; a first bank terminal supported by the
housing; a second bank terminal supported by the housing and connectable to the first bank
terminal; a first load terminal supported by the housing and connectable to the first bank
terminal; a second load terminal supported by the housing and connectable to the second bank
                                                          1

terminal; and a selector supported by the housing and rotatably mounted to the housing. The
selector may have four positions, including, a first position in which the first and second bank
terminals are disconnected from the first and second load terminals, a second position in which
the first bank terminal is connected to the first load terminal and the second bank terminal is
disconnected from the second load terminal, a third position in which the first bank terminal is
connected to the first load terminal, the second bank terminal is connected to the second load
terminal, and the first bank terminal is disconnected from the second bank terminal, and a fourth
position in which the first bank terminal is connected to the first load terminal and the second
bank terminal and the second bank terminal is connected to the second load terminal.
[0006]              The disclosure provides a battery switch including a housing having a removable side
panel; a base; and two terminals within the housing. Each terminal has a fixed end and a free
end. The two terminals extend upwardly from the base. Each free end is positioned in a space
between the base and the housing. The free ends of each of the terminals are accessible by
removing the side panel. The terminals may be engaged by a connection link over the top of the
free end of each of the terminals in the direction from the housing to the base. The terminals may
be threaded. The battery switch may further include a rotary selector located on top of the
housing and a shaft coupled to the rotary selector. The shaft may extend down to a space below
the terminals.
[0007]              Another embodiment provides a method of selectively connecting a first bank
terminal, a second bank terminal, a first load terminal, and a second load terminal. The method
may include selecting a first position of a rotary selector in which the first and second bank
terminals are disconnected from the first and second load terminals,               selecting a second
position of the rotary selector in which the first bank terminal is connected to the first load
terminal and the second bank terminal is disconnected from the second load terminal, selecting a
third position of the rotary selector in which the first bank terminal is connected to the first load
terminal, the second bank terminal is connected to the second load terminal, and the first bank
terminal is disconnected from the second bank terminal, and selecting a fourth position of the
rotary selector in which the first bank terminal is connected to the first load terminal and the
second bank terminal and the second bank terminal is connected to the second load terminal.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0035]              Before any embodiments are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the
disclosure is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of
components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following drawings. The
disclosure is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in
various ways.
[0036]              Figs. 1 and 2A-2B illustrate one embodiment of a battery switch 100. The battery
switch 100 connects a first battery BI, a second battery B2, a first load LI, and a second load L2
in a plurality of configurations. The battery switch 100 includes a base 105 and a housing 110
having a plurality of side panels 115. As illustrated in Figs. 2A and 2B, in some embodiments,
the interior of the battery switch 100 is accessible by removing one or more of the side panels
115.
[0037]              The battery switch 100 further includes a rotary selector, or selector knob, 120. The
selector knob 120 rotates between a plurality of positions. In one embodiment, the selector knob
120 rotates between four positions described in more detail below: an off-position; a first load
on-position; a first and second load on-position; and a first and second load connected in parallel
position. In other embodiments, the selector knob 120 rotates between more or less positions.
[0038]              Fig. 3 is an exploded perspective view of the battery switch 100. As illustrated, the
battery switch 100 may further include a plurality of fasteners 125 connecting the housing 110 to
the base 105. The battery switch 100 may further include a contact carrier subassembly 130 and
a terminal plate subassembly 135.
[0039]              The contact carrier subassembly 130 is connected to the base 105 via a shaft, or stub
shaft, 140 and, in some embodiments, a first O-ring 145. The contact carrier subassembly 130
may include a carrier plate 150. The stub shaft 140 extends through, and is non-rotatably
coupled to, the carrier plate 150, such that turning of the stub shaft 140 turns the carrier plate 150
and thus the contact carrier subassembly 130.
                                                           5
10177950 1 (GHMatters) P103012.AU.1

[0040]              The terminal plate subassembly 135 is in rotatable contact with the contact carrier
subassembly 130 and non-rotatably coupled to the base 105. In some embodiments, the terminal
plate subassembly 135 is coupled to the base 105 via a plurality of second fasteners 152. The
terminal plate subassembly 135 may include, among other things, a terminal plate 155 and a
plurality of terminals, or terminal studs, 160 coupled to the terminal plate 155. Although
illustrated as having two terminals 160, in other embodiments (for example as illustrated in Figs.
4-6) there may be more terminals 160.
[0041]              The terminal plate 155 includes an aperture 165. The stub shaft 140 extends through
the aperture 165 and couples to a selector shaft 170, which is non-rotatably coupled to the
selector knob 120. In some embodiments, a second O-ring 175 may be provided between the
base 100 and the terminal plate 155 in order to seal against dirt and moisture. In some
embodiments, the battery switch 100 may further include a plurality of third fasteners 180 and a
plurality of washers 185 for securing and/or coupling the terminals 160 to an outside device
(discussed in more detail below in Fig. 16). In such an embodiment, the terminals 160 may be
threaded.
[0042]              Figs. 4A - 6B illustrate various exploded, or partially exploded, views of the contact
subassembly 130 and the terminal plate subassembly 135, including exploded top-perspective
views and exploded bottom-perspective views. As illustrated, the contact carrier subassembly
130 may further include compression springs 190, a contact support plate 195, and lobed
contacts 200a, 200b.
[0043]              The contact support plate 195 is snap fit to the carrier plate 150 in such a manner that
the contact support plate 195 floats relative to the carrier plate 150 in order to permit the
compression springs 190 to be compressed. The contact support plate 195 couples to the lobed
contacts 200a, 200b. The contact support plate 195 may include dimples 212, which press
against the bottom side of the lobed contacts 200a, 200b in order to allow the lobed contacts 200
to rock relative to the contact support plate 195. The lobed contacts 200a, 200b may include
contact lobes 205a, 205b, 205c, 205d, 205e, and 205f.
[0044]              The terminal plate subassembly 135 may further include contact plates 210a, 2 1Ob,
210c, and 210d coupled to the plurality of terminals 160a, 160b, 160c, and 160d respectively.
                                                          6
10177950 1 (GHMatters) P103012.AU.1

The terminals 160a-160d are inserted through the terminal plate 155 and are staked, welded, or
otherwise mechanically and electrically connected to the respective contact plates 210a-210d. In
some embodiments, the contact plates 21 Oa-2 1Od are insulated from one another via an
insulation material (e.g., rubber, plastic, etc.).
[0045]              When the contact subassembly 130 and the terminal plate subassembly 135 are in
contact, the contact lobes 205a-205f selectively contact the bottoms of the contact plates 210a
210d. The contact of the contact lobes 205a-205f with the contact plates 210a-210d is promoted
by the compression springs 190.
[0046]                 Figs. 7A and 7B illustrate an exploded view of the battery switch 100 with the
contact subassembly 130 and the terminal plate subassembly 135 coupled to the base 105. In
one embodiment, as illustrated, the housing 110 is connected to the base 105 via the two or more
fasteners 125 (further detailed below in Figs. 8-14). In other embodiments, the housing 110 may
be connected to the base 105 by other suitable means. As discussed above, the stub shaft 140
extends through the aperture 165 and is non-rotatably coupled to both the contact carrier
subassembly 130 (located under the terminal plate subassembly 135) and the selector shaft 170.
Thus, when the selector shaft 170 is turned (via the selector knob 120), the contact carrier
subassembly 130 turns as well, while the terminal plate subassembly 135 maintains position.
[0047]              Figs. 8-15 illustrate connection of the one of the fasteners 125 to the base 105 and
housing 110. The fastener 125 may include slots 220, grooves 225, and a ramped surface 230.
The slots 220 are located at a top end of the fastener 125. The slots 220 receive keys 235 of the
housing 110 and when the fastener 125 is turned clockwise, the keys 235 catch in the grooves
225 in order to secure the fastener 125 to the housing 110. The ramped surface 230 is located at
a bottom end of the fastener 125 and couples the fastener 125 to the base 105. When the fastener
125 is turned clockwise, the ramped surface 230 of the fastener 125 catches on a ledge 240 of the
base 105.
[0048]              Figs. 11 and 12 illustrate the fasteners 125 in an unlocked position. In the unlocked
position, keys 235 of the fasteners 125 are not caught in the grooves 225 of the housing 110 and
the ramped surfaces 230 of the fasteners 125 are not caught on the ledges 240 of the base 105.
Figs. 13 and 14 illustrate the fasteners 125 in a locked position. In the locked position, keys 235
                                                           7
10177950 1 (GHMatters) P103012.AU.1

are caught in the grooves 225 and the ramped surfaces 230 are caught on the ledges 240, thereby
securing the housing 110 to the base 105.
[0049]              Fig. 15 illustrates a partially exploded top-perspective view of the battery switch 100.
As illustrated, the terminals 160 each include a fixed end 245 and a free end 247. The terminals
160 are connected to the base 105 via the fixed ends 245. The free ends 247 are located in a
space between the base 105 and the housing 110. The free ends 247 of the terminals 160 are
accessible by removing one or more side panels 115.
[0050]              Fig. 16 illustrates the battery switch 100 electrically connected to an electrical device,
such as but not limited to, a fuse block 250. As discussed above, in some embodiments, the free
ends 247 of the terminals 160 are accessible by removing one or more of the side panels 115.
The terminals 160 are electronically connected to the fuse block 250 via a connection link 255.
In some embodiments, the connection link 255 engages the terminal 160 over the top of the free
ends 247 in a direction from the housing 110 to the base 105. In some embodiments, the
connection link 255 is mechanically secured to the terminal 160 via the third fasteners 180 and
washers 185 (Fig. 3).
[0051]              Fig. 17 is a top view of the contact plates 210a, 210b, 210c, and 210d coupled to the
plurality of terminals 160a, 160b, 160c, and 160d respectively, with the terminals 160a, 160b,
160c, and 160d electrically coupled to the first battery BI, the second battery B2, the first load
LI, and the second load L2 respectively. In the illustrated embodiment, contact plate 210a and
its corresponding terminal 160a may be identified as first load, or first load terminal, LI; contact
plate 21 Ob and its corresponding terminal 160b may be identified as second load, or second load
terminal, L2; contact plate 210c and its corresponding terminal 160c may be identified as first
battery, or first bank terminal, B 1; and contact plate 21 Od and its corresponding terminal 160d
may be identified as second battery, or second bank terminal, B2.
[0052]              Figs. 18-21 illustrate the various positions of operation of the battery switch 100. Fig.
18 illustrates the battery switch 100 in the off-position. In the off-position, all three lobes 205a
205c of lobed contact 200a are in contact with contact plate 210c (B1), while all three lobes
205d-205f of lobed contact 200b are in contact with contact plate 210b (L2). Therefore, there is
                                                            8
10177950 1 (GHMatters) P103012.AU.1

no electrical connection between the first load L1, the second load L2, the first battery B 1, and
the second battery B2.
[0053]              Fig. 19 illustrates the battery switch 100 in the first load on-position (i.e., Li is
electrically connected to BI). Upon turning the knob 120 forty-five degrees from the off
position, the battery switch 100 is placed in the first load on-position with the first load LI being
electrically connected to the first battery B 1. As illustrated, when in the first load on-position,
lobe 205b is in contact with contact plate 210a (L1), while lobes 205a and 205c are in contact
with contact plate 210c (BI). Additionally, all three lobes 205d-205f are in contact with contact
plate 210b (L2). Therefore, the first load LI and the first battery BI are electrically connected,
while there is no electrical connection between the second load L2 and the second battery B2.
[0054]              Fig. 20 illustrates the battery switch 100 in the first and second load on-position (i.e.,
LI is electrically connected to BI and L2 is electrically connected to B2). Upon turning the
knob 120 forty-five degrees from the first load on-position, the battery switch 100 is placed in
the first and second load on-position. As illustrated, when in the first and second load on
position, lobes 205b and 205c are in contact with contact plate 210a (L1), while lobe 205a is in
contact with contact plate 210c (BI). Additionally, lobes 205d and 205f are in contact with
contact plate 210d (B2), while lobe 205c is in contact with contact plate 210b (L2). Therefore,
the first load LI is electrically connected to the first battery BI and the second load L2 is
electrically connected to the second battery B2.
[0055]              Fig. 21 illustrates the battery switch 100 in the first and second load connected in
parallel position (i.e., LI and L2 are connected in parallel with BI and B2). Upon turning the
knob 120 forty-five degrees from the first and second load on-position, the battery switch 100 is
placed in the first and second load connected in parallel position. As illustrated, when in the first
and second load connected in parallel position, lobe 205c is in contact with contact plate 210a
(LI), lobe 205b of lobed contact 200a and lobe 205d of lobed contact 200b are in contact with
contact plate 21Ob (L2), lobe 205a of lobed contact 200a and lobe 205f of lobed contact 200b are
in contact with contact plate 210c (B1), and lobe 205e is in contact with contact plate 210d (B2).
Therefore, the first load Li and the second load L2 are connected in parallel with the first battery
BI and the second battery B2.
