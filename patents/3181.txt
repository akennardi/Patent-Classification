Abtract: Travel pauses a lot of challenges when choosing the shoes to match the outfits as
well as satisfy the limited amount of kilograms one can carry on the flight or plane
considering that light travel is very convenient. The STOSC will solve the problem
because it can be easily folded and placed on a bag just like underwear.
One can carry it in a bag on a hot day and use the STOSC in the evening to cover toes
and also going to places with a shoe no open toe dress code.
The STOSC can be used to match different outfits and handbag and this is another way of
glamourising a simple outfit. The STOSC is trendy and suitable for busy people on the go,
throw it in the bag, you are on the way.
The STOSC is ready for any event or outing and reduces instances when one is caught
out with no plan, the STOSC takes care of these situations.
It can be warm and hot one hour and cool the next, the STOSC is ready for an instant
conversion of a sandal or flip-flop to a shoe look alike.
The STOSC is fashionable, unusual and trendy for those who like a outstanding look.
I have not seen the STOSC used or advertised anywhere and I have not seen same
STOSC anywhere on searching for patents Australia. The STOSC is a piece of material
sewn at the end to form a pocket that will cover the toes to create an instant toe cover and
can be worn with a sandal or flip -flop, the rest of the materials will form the extension
ties that will be used to wrap around the sandal or flip flop cris-crossing at the bottom of
the heel extending to the side to the heels and cris -cross at the heel to form cover for the
heels and tieing a bow at the ankles as a fasten to create a shoe look alike. And one can

walk with a toe covered sandal or flip-flop that has been instantly converted using the
STOSC.
I intent to patent the STOSC as an innovation Patent since the terms and part of the sock
exist in other forms like socks and stockings.
