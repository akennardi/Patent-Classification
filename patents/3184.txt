 service to be provided for a requesting user by a service provider. In some
 examples, the on-demand service system can provide information relevant
 to the requesting user to the service provider for purposes of assisting the
 service provider in performing the on-demand service.

  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
  [0009]      Examples described herein provide for a system that can
 automatically configure an indication device (or a display device) for use
 with an on-demand service. As referred to herein, an indication device is a
 device that is capable of providing illumination, displaying content, and/or
                                          1

WO 2015/175030                                                 PCT/US2015/014406
 outputting audio, and that can be positioned or fastened, for example, on or
 within a vehicle operated by a service provider (e.g., a transport service
 provider, a delivery provider, etc.). Such an indication device can be
 positioned to be easily visible to a user or positioned proximate to a
 particular entry or door of the vehicle to indicate to the user where to enter.
 The system can use information specified or configured by a user of an on
 demand service to cause the indication device to dynamically adjust the
 output for a predefined duration of time. Examples of features that can be
 configured by a user include a color(s), a pattern(s), an illumination
 sequence(s), text, visual content, video, and/or audio. In this manner,
 when the service provider approaches a user for purposes of providing the
 on-demand service, the indication device can be dynamically configured and
 personalized in a manner specified and recognizable by the user, thereby
 informing the user which vehicle has been assigned to the user to provide
 the on-demand service.
  [0010]      According to some examples, a transport personalization system
 can be a part of or be in communication with the on-demand service
 system. In one example, the on-demand service system can arrange a
 transport service for a user by receiving a request for transport from the
 user's device, selecting a driver from a plurality of available drivers to
 perform the transport service for that user, sending an invitation to the
 selected driver's device, and receiving an acceptance of the invitation by the
 selected driver. The on-demand service system can associate an identifier of
 the user and an identifier of the driver with an entry for that transport
 service. Once the on-demand service system arranges the transport service
 for the user and the driver, the transport personalization system can access
 a user database to determine whether that user has specified an output
 configuration for an indication device (e.g., determine whether the user has
 personalized at least one aspect of the transport service). For example, the
 transport personalization system can determine if the user has specified an
 output configuration in the user's account. If the user has specified an
 output configuration, the transport personalization system can identify data
 corresponding to the output configuration and transmit the data to the
 driver device of the driver that is to provide the transport service for the
                                          2

WO 2015/175030                                                PCT/US2015/014406
 user. In the case where the driver is in possession of and uses an indication
 device, the data can enable the driver device to control the indication device
 using the data, such as during at least a duration of the transport service
 (e.g., while the transport service is in progress for that user). In such an
 example, once the transport service is completed for the user, the driver
 device can be instructed or caused to no longer control the indication device
 using the user's output configuration.
  [0011]      As described herein, the output configuration for an indication
 device can specify the manner in which the indication device is to output or
 emit light or content. Depending on implementation, the output
 configuration can specify one or more colors of light to be outputted by the
 indication device, one or more patterns in which light is to be outputted by
 the indication device, and/or one or more sequences of illumination in which
 light is to be outputted by the indication device, so that different portions of
 the indication device can be illuminated at different times. A user can access
 the user's account via a portal on the user's computing device, such as
 through use of a webpage or a designated client service application in
 communication with the on-demand service system and/or the transport
 personalization system, in order to configure the output configuration.
  [0012]      Still further, in some examples, the on-demand service system
 and/or the transport personalization system (collectively referred to herein
 as the system), can monitor the transport service to determine the state of
 the transport service. In some examples, the transport service can be in
 progress for a user from the time the selected driver accepts an invitation to
 perform the transport service or from the time the selected driver begins to
 travel from a position in which the selected driver accepted the invitation
 until the transport service has been completed by the driver (e.g., the
 driver has dropped off the user at the user's destination). The system can
 monitor the transport service using information received from the driver
 device (e.g., periodically or intermittently from driver user input), such as
 from a driver service application operating on the driver device, and/or
 information about the transport service (e.g., the pickup location and/or the
 destination location specified by the user). Depending on implementation,
 the system can transmit the data corresponding to the output configuration
                                          3

WO 2015/175030                                                 PCT/US2015/014406
 to the driver device during the progress of the transport service, but before
 the driver arrives at the pickup location specified by the user in the user's
 request for the transport service.
  [0013]      In some variations, the indication device (also referred to herein
 as a lighting or illumination device) can have different housing shapes or
 features to be fixed to a vehicle. For example, an indication device can
 include a body, a power source or power input port to receive power from a
 power source, a communication interface, and a base. Depending on
 implementation, the body can be formed of a translucent, semi-transparent,
 or transparent material that can be at least partially illuminated by a light
 source. As an addition or an alternative, the body can include or be formed
 as a display device that can output content (e.g., a flat panel display). In
 either examples, the body can be shaped to have at least one surface that
 is substantially flat and can have dimensions in which its length is
 substantially larger (e.g., two or more times larger) than both its height and
 its width, and/or its height is substantially larger (e.g., two or more times
 larger) than its width (e.g., the body can be in the shape of a blade). The
 body can provide illumination and/or output content that is customized
 based on the user-specified output configuration information.
  [0014]      The body can also be coupled to a base that extends at least
 partially along the length of the body. The base can include one or more
 fastening mechanisms or structures to enable the indication device to be
 coupled or fastened (e.g., either permanently or temporarily) to a vehicle.
 In one example, the base can also house one or more components of the
 indication device, such as a communication interface, a light source, a
 power source or a port for the power source, a light or display controller,
 wires or connection components, etc. The communication interface can
 enable the indication device to communicate (e.g., wirelessly or via a wire
 or cable) with the driver device to receive configuration data.
  [0015]      In another example, the indication device can have a body that
 has a length, a width, and a height, with its length being substantially
 greater (e.g., two or more times larger) than its width and its height, but its
 width being greater than its height. The body can have a first facade or
 surface that extends along the length and the width of the body. The body
                                         4

WO 2015/175030                                                 PCT/US2015/014406
 can also house one or more light sources to illuminate at least a portion of
 the first facade. The indication device can include a base that is coupled to
 the body and that extends along at least a portion of the length of the body
 and at least a portion of the width of the body. The indication device can
 also include one or more fastening mechanisms to enable the illumination
 device to adhere to a surface such that the first facade of the body faces the
 surface. Such a surface can be an interior surface of a window of a vehicle
 or a windshield. The indication device can communicate with the driver's
 device using a communication interface (e.g., wireless and/or a wire/cable)
 so that the controller device can receive data from the driver's device in
 order to control the one or more light sources. In this manner, when the
 driver's device receives the data corresponding to a user's output
 configuration, the driver's device can provide control signals to the
 indication device to control the manner in which the indication device
 outputs or emits light.
  [0016]      As used herein, a client device, a driver device, and/or a
 computing device refer to devices corresponding to desktop computers,
 cellular devices or smartphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptop
 computers, tablet devices, television (IP Television), etc., that can provide
 network connectivity and processing resources for communicating with a
 notification system and/or a dispatch system over a network. A driver
 device can also correspond to other devices of a transit object, such as an
 in-vehicle computing system, or custom hardware, etc. The client device
 and/or the driver device can also each operate a designated service
 application that is configured to communicate with the on-demand service
 system and/or the transport personalization system. Still further, while
 some examples described herein relate to transport services, the systems
 describe herein can be used to provide other on-demand services, such as a
 food truck service, a delivery service, an entertainment service, etc.
  [0017]      One or more examples described herein provide that methods,
 techniques, and actions performed by a computing device are performed
 programmatically, or as a computer-implemented method.
  Programmatically, as used herein, means through the use of code or
 computer-executable instructions. These instructions can be stored in one
                                          5

 or more memory resources of the computing device. A programmatically
 performed step may or may not be automatic.
  [0018]      One or more examples described herein can be implemented
 using programmatic modules, engines, or components. A programmatic
 module, engine, or component can include a program, a sub-routine, a
 portion of a program, or a software component or a hardware component
 capable of performing one or more stated tasks or functions. As used
 herein, a module or component can exist on a hardware component
 independently of other modules or components. Alternatively, a module or
 component can be a shared element or process of other modules, programs
 or machines.
  [0019]      Some examples described herein can generally require the use of
 computing devices, including processing and memory resources. Examples
 described herein may be implemented, in whole or in part, on computing
 devices such as servers, desktop computers, cellular or smartphones,
 personal digital assistants (e.g., PDAs), laptop computers, printers, network
 equipments (e.g., routers) and tablet devices. Memory, processing, and
 network resources may all be used in connection with the establishment,
 use, or performance of any example described herein (including with the
 performance of any method or with the implementation of any system).
  [0020]      Furthermore, one or more examples described herein may be
 implemented through the use of instructions that are executable by one or
 more processors. These instructions may be carried on a computer-readable
 medium. Machines shown or described with figures below provide examples
 of processing resources and computer-readable mediums on which
 instructions for implementing examples can be carried and/or executed. In
 particular, the numerous machines shown with examples include
 processor(s) and various forms of memory for holding data and instructions.
  Examples of computer-readable mediums include permanent memory
 storage devices, such as hard drives on personal computers or servers.
 Other examples of computer storage mediums include portable storage
 units, such as CD or DVD units, flash memory (such as carried on
 smartphones, multifunctional devices or tablets), and magnetic memory.
 Computers, terminals, network enabled devices (e.g., mobile devices, such
                                        6

 as cell phones) are all examples of machines and devices that utilize
 processors, memory, and instructions stored on computer-readable
 mediums. Additionally, examples may be implemented in the form of
 computer-programs, or a computer usable carrier medium capable of
 carrying such a program.
 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
  [0021]      FIG. 1 illustrates an example system to provide configuration
 information for controlling an indication device for use with an on-demand
 service. According to an example, a personalization system, such as the
 system 100 of FIG. 1, can provide a mechanism that enables a user to
 control what is illuminated or displayed on an indication device that is in
 possession by a service provider. For example, the indication device can be
 a lighting or display device that is fastened to a vehicle, so that when the
 vehicle approaches the user for pick up, the indication device can illuminate
 a color (and/or in an illumination sequence) specified by the user, thereby
 indicating to the user which vehicle the user is to enter.
  [0022]      In one example, the system 100 can include a personalization
 management 110, a client device interface 120, a driver device interface
  130, and a client database 140. The system 100 can be a part of or
 communicate with an on-demand service system and/or can include other
 components or databases, such as a configuration database, which are not
 illustrated in FIG. 1 for purpose of simplicity. The components of the system
  100 can combine to enable a user that requests an on-demand service to
 configure an indication device operated by a service provider (e.g., a
 lighting device 170) for use with the on-demand service (e.g., before or
 after requesting the on-demand service). Logic can be implemented with
 various applications (e.g., software) and/or with firmware or hardware of a
 computer system that implements the system 100.
  [0023]      Depending on implementation, one or more components of the
 system 100 can be implemented on a computing device, such as a server,
 laptop, PC, etc., or on multiple computing devices that can communicate
 with the client devices 150 and the driver devices 160 over one or more
 networks. In some examples, a computing device can operate or execute an
 application to perform one or more of the processes described by the
                                          7

WO 2015/175030                                               PCT/US2015/014406
 various components of the system 100. The system 100 can also be
 implemented through other computer systems in alternative architectures
 (e.g., peer-to-peer networks, etc.).
  [0024]      The system 100 can communicate, over one or more networks
 via a network interface (e.g., wirelessly or using a wire), with the client
 devices 150 (e.g., mobile computing devices operated by clients or
 users/customers) and the driver devices 160 (e.g., mobile computing
 devices operated by drivers) using a client device interface 120 and a driver
 device interface 130, respectively. The client and driver device interfaces
  120, 130 can enable and manage communications between the system 100
 and each of the client and driver devices 150, 160. In some examples, each
 of the client devices 150 and the driver devices 160 can individually operate
 a designated service application 151, 161, respectively, that interfaces with
 the respective device interfaces 120, 130 to communicate with system 100.
 According to some examples, the applications can include or use an
 application programming interface (API), such as an externally facing API,
 to communicate data with the device interfaces 120, 130. The externally
 facing API can provide access to system 100 via secure access channels
 over the network through any number of methods, such as web-based
 forms, programmatic access via restful APIs, Simple Object Access Protocol
 (SOAP), remote procedure call (RPC), scripting access, etc.
  [0025]      As described herein, the system 100 can be a part of or
 communicate with an on-demand service system, such as a dispatch system
 of the on-demand service system (not shown in FIG. 1). Examples of an on
 demand service can include a transport service, a food truck service, a
 delivery service, a traveling entertainment service, etc. A dispatch system
 for a transport service, for example, can receive requests from users
 operating client devices and arrange for transport services to be provided to
 the users by service providers (e.g., drivers). The driver devices 160 can
 provide current or real-time information about the drivers to the dispatch
 system and/or the system 100, and based, at least in part, on the driver
 information, the dispatch system can determine the pricing for the transport
 service in a given geographic region, can select a driver for a requesting
 user, can determine if the transport service has been successfully
                                         8

WO 2015/175030                                                  PCT/US2015/014406
 completed, etc. In addition, when a transport service is arranged for a user,
 the system 100 can receive transport information 111 about the transport
 service from the on-demand service system and determine whether to
 transmit user-specified configuration data to the driver device of the driver
 selected to provide the transport service. The configuration data can enable
 the driver device to control the driver's indication device for the user.
  [0026]      As illustrated in FIG. 1, a driver device 160 can be in
 communication with an indication device 170. A driver of a vehicle that
 operates the driver device 160, for example, can be in possession of the
 indication device 170, which can be fixed or fastened (e.g., permanently or
 temporarily) to the vehicle. The indication device 170 can include a
 communication interface that enables the indication device 170 to connect
 to the driver device 160 wirelessly and/or using a wire(s) or cable(s). For
 example, the driver device 160 can wirelessly communicate with the
 indication device 170 using a Bluetooth protocol. As an addition or an
 alternative, the indication device 170 can be in communication with system
  100 to be controlled by operations of the system 100 (e.g., over one or
 more networks or via the driver device 160). The indication device 170 can
 include an output device, such as an illumination mechanism or a display,
 that can output or emit light or display content based on user-specified
 configurations.
  [0027]      According to some examples, the personalization management
  110 can receive the transport information 111 of the arranged transport
 service from the dispatch system when the transport service is arranged for
 a user and a driver. The transport information 111 can include (i) an
 identifier (ID) corresponding to the arranged transport service, (ii) an
 identifier of the user and/or the client device 150 receiving the transport
 service, (iii) an identifier of the driver and/or the driver device 160
 providing the transport service, and/or (iv) status information about the
 driver with respect to the transport service. Depending on implementation,
 the personalization management 110 can receive the transport information
  111 in response to the transport service being initially arranged by the
 dispatch system. The personalization management 110 can determine when
 and whether to transmit configuration information specified by the user for
                                           9

WO 2015/175030                                                  PCT/US2015/014406
 an indication device 170 to the driver. The personalization management 110
 can also receive the status information of the driver (e.g., periodically or in
 response to changes to the driver's status information) during a duration
 from when the transport service is arranged until completion of the
 transport service.
  [0028]      When the personalization management 110 receives the
 transport information 111, the personalization management 110 can use
 the user ID to access the client database 140. The client database 140 can
 store a plurality of client profiles 141 (or client accounts) for each user that
 has an account with the on-demand service system. A client profile 141 can
 include (or be associated with) a user identifier, contact information,
 payment/billing information, device and/or the service application 151
 information (e.g., version information), user preferences, historical
 information about previous transport services provided for the user, etc.
 The user preferences can be configured by the user and can include
 indication (or sign) preferences, such as color, text, pattern, illumination
 sequence, media content, etc., related to the output of an indication device.
  [0029]      The personalization management 110 can perform a lookup of
 the client profile 141 (e.g., using the user's ID or user's device ID) and
 determine if the user has specified an output configuration for an indication
 device. If the user has specified (e.g., in the user preferences) the output
 configuration, the personalization management 110 can determine and/or
 retrieve the configuration data 145 corresponding to the specified
 configuration for that user. In one example, the personalization
 management 110 can receive information about the output configuration
 from the client profile 141 and retrieve the configuration data 145 from a
 configuration database. On the other hand, if the personalization
 management 110 determines that the user has not specified an output
 configuration, the personalization management 110 can transmit a message
 or a prompt (e.g., an in-application message displayed by the service
 application 151 or a text message) to the user's client device 150 informing
 the user that the user can configure one or more indication preferences. If
 the user operates the service application 151 and provides indication
 preferences, the personalization management 110 can receive the user's
                                          10

WO 2015/175030                                                PCT/US2015/014406
 preferences and store the preferences with the user's profile 141 in the
 client database 140. If the user does not provide indication preferences,
 however, the personalization management 110 can store or maintain
 default indication preferences in the user's profile 141. In some examples,
 the personalization management 110 can perform these steps after the
 transport service has been arranged but before the driver has arrived at the
 pick up location and/or before the driver has initiated the transport service.
  [0030]      The personalization management 110 can transmit the user's
 configuration data 145 corresponding to the user's indication preferences
 (or default configuration data if the user has not specified indication
 preferences) to the driver device 160. For example, the personalization
 management 110 can determine the driver that is to provide the transport
 service by identifying the driver's ID from the transport information 111.
  Depending on implementation, if there is no configuration data 145 for
 indication preferences specified by the user, the personalization
 management 110 can transmit default configuration data to the driver
 device 160 or transmit a message (without sending default configuration
 data) indicating to the driver's service application 161 operating on the
 driver device 160 that the driver's own configuration data or default
 configuration data is to be used for controlling the indication device 170.
  [0031]      The driver device 160 can run the service application 161 for
 purposes of communicating with the on-demand service system (and/or the
 system 100). For example, the driver can operate the service application
  161 when the driver is ready or available to provide transport services. The
 service application 161 can also enable the driver device 160 to
 communicate with the indication device 170 using the communication
 interfaces of the driver device 160 and the indication device 170. In one
 example, the driver device 160 and the indication device 170 can
 communicate with each other using a Bluetooth protocol or using another
 short range wireless technology protocol. In another example, the driver
 device 160 and the indication device 170 can communicate with each other
 over a wire or cable. The service application 161 can receive the
 configuration data 145 from the system 100 and control the indication
 device 170 using the configuration data 145 via one or more control signals

WO 2015/175030                                                 PCT/US2015/014406
 over the communication interfaces of the driver device 160 and the
 indication device 170. In one example, the indication device 170 can include
 a device controller that provides control signals to the light source or display
 of the indication device 170 based on the configuration data 145.
  [0032]      The service application 161 can also receive invitations for
 transport services from the on-demand service system and provide location
 information and/or status information of the driver to the on-demand
 service system. The service application 161 can interface with components
 of the driver device 160, such as the global positioning system (GPS)
 component of the driver device 160 to determine a current position or
 location of the driver device 160. In one example, after (and before) the
 driver accepts the invitation to provide the transport service for the user via
 interaction with the service application 161, the driver device 160 can
 periodically transmit GPS location data points to the on-demand service
 system (and/or the system 100).
  [0033]      According to an example, the on-demand service system can
 determine different states of the transport service or the driver by using
 information received from the service application 161. As referred to herein,
 a state of the transport service or a state of the driver can refer to the
 current condition of the driver when providing transport service. A driver
 can be in one of a plurality of different states that include, for example: (i)
 unavailable (e.g., off duty), (ii) available (e.g., on duty) but not yet
 providing transport service, (iii) en route to the pickup location of the user
 after accepting an invitation for transport service, (iv) arriving at the pickup
 location (e.g., the driver is approaching the pickup location), (v) on trip
 (e.g., the user has entered the vehicle, the transport service has begun), or
 (vi) completed trip (e.g., the driver has completed the transport service by
 dropping off the user at the user's destination location). The state
 information used by the on-demand service system to keep track of the
 driver, determine whether it can select the driver for a transport service,
 determine how long and how far the driver has driven the user for purposes
 of determining the fare, etc. Depending on examples, the driver operating
 the driver device 160 (and in possession of the indication device 170) can
 indicate what state the driver is currently in by providing input to the
                                          12

WO 2015/175030                                                  PCT/US2015/014406
 service application 161 (e.g., input that the driver has accepted the
 invitation, that the driver is approaching the user, that the driver has
 completed the transport service, etc.). The service application 161 can
 provide state information to the on-demand service system.
  [0034]      In another example, the on-demand service system can use
 location information from the driver's device 160 and/or the transport
 information 111 to automatically determine the driver's state or the state of
 the transport service. For example, the on-demand service system can
 determine that the driver is en route to the pickup location in response to
 receiving the acceptance of the invitation from the driver device 160 and/or
 in response to determining that the driver has changed positions (from GPS
 data of the driver device 160) since the acceptance. In another example,
 the on-demand service system can programmatically determine that the
 driver is arriving at the pickup location or has reached the pickup location
 by comparing the location data of the driver with the specified pickup
 location of the user (e.g., if the driver's position is within a predetermined
 distance of the user's current location or the pickup location). Still further,
 similarly, the on-demand service system can programmatically determine
 that the driver has completed the transport service by comparing the
 location data of the driver with the specified destination location of the user,
 if provided. Accordingly, in variations, the on-demand service system can
 provide the state information to the service application 161 and/or the
 service application 161 can provide the state information to the on-demand
 service system. In this manner, in either examples, the service application
  161 and the system 100 can recognize the state of the transport service or
 the driver.
  [0035]      According to some examples, based on the state of the transport
 service or the driver, the system 100 and/or the service application 161 can
 control the operation of the indication device 170. As described herein, the
 system 100 can provide the configuration data 145 for the particular user to
 the selected driver's device 160 for use during the specific transport service.
 In this manner, when that driver completes the transport service, he or she
 can receive another invitation for transport service for another user, and
 receive, if any, the configuration data 145 for the other user during the
                                          13

WO 2015/175030                                                PCT/US2015/014406
 progress of another transport service. During the progress of the transport
 service, the service application 161 can use the state information to control
 the indication device 170 to output different colors, content, patterns, etc.,
 based on the state of the transport service or the driver. In other words,
 based on the indicated state (e.g., arriving now or on trip), the service
 application 161 can tailor the output of the indication device 170.
  [0036]      For example, the configuration data 145 of the user preference
 can specify that a blue color to be outputted by the indication device 170.
 When the driver accepts a transport request and is en route to the pick up
 location of the user for the transport service, the service application 161 can
 cause the indication device 170 to output a default color or be turned off to
 conserve power because the user will not yet see the vehicle or the
 indication device 170. At a time when the driver is approaching the pickup
 location, the driver can input on the service application 161 that the driver
 is close to the user's pickup location or the service application 161 and/or
 the on-demand service system can determine that the driver's current
 location is within a predetermined distance of the pickup location of the
 user. The state of the transport service can correspond to the driver
 "arriving now." When the service application 161 determines that the
 transport service is to change states from "en route" to "arriving now," for
 example, the service application 161 can trigger or control the indication
 device to output the user's specified color, e.g., blue, (and/or other
 preferred output content, patterns, or sequences) so that the user can see
 which vehicle is approaching and will provide the service for the user. The
 service application 161 can also control the indication device to output the
 user's specified display/output preferences in a specific configuration that is
 based on the transport state.
  [0037]      As an addition or an alternative, the system 100 can receive
 information about the transport state from the service application 161 and
 the personalization management 110 can use the configuration data 145 of
 the user preference to control the indication device 170 based on the
 transport state (e.g., as opposed to the service application 161 controlling
 the indication device 170). For example, the indication device 170 can
 include network resources to be in communication with system 100 over
                                         14

WO 2015/175030                                                 PCT/US2015/014406
 one or more networks (and/or via the driver device 160). In such an
 example, the system 100 can control the output of the indication device 170
 without input provided by the driver operating the driver device 160.
  [0038]      In this manner, by enabling the user to provide user-specified
 preferences for the indication device 170, the system 100 can provide the
 user with a personalized on-demand service experience. In addition, in
 some situations, such as during darkness or when the user is at a crowded
 street corner or area (e.g., an airport) and waiting for the vehicle, the
 personalized experience can indicate to the user which vehicle is the user's
 vehicle for purposes of the transport service. The indication device 170 can
 show the user's specified color, content, pattern, etc., so that in a group of
 vehicles, the user can easily determine which vehicle to enter. Still further,
 the indication device 170 can also display or include features, such as a
 trademark or name, associated with the on-demand service provider,
 thereby providing brand recognition for the on-demand service provider.
  [0039]      As an addition or an alternative, the indication device 170 can
 also include other components or sensors, such as a GPS receiver and/or an
 inertial measurement unit (INU). These components or sensors can be used
 to periodically determine real-time conditions of the vehicle while the
 indication device 170 is powered on and in operation. The indication device
  170 can provide to the driver device 160, via one or more communication
 interfaces, data determined from the components or sensors (referred to
 herein as indication device information 131). The service application 161
 can store the indication device information 131 in a memory resource
 and/or concurrently provide the indication device information 131 to the on
 demand service system and/or the system 100. The indication device
 information 131 can be used by the on-demand service system to
 complement or supplement data corresponding to a transport service or to
 determine, with higher accuracy, the bearing, the movement, the direction
 of movement, etc. of the driver's vehicle (before, after, or during transport
 service).
 INDICATION DEVICE EXAMPLES
  [0040]      FIGS. 2A through 2R illustrate example indication devices for use
 with an on-demand service. The example indication devices described in
                                         15

WO 2015/175030                                                 PCT/US2015/014406
  FIGS. 2A through 2R can correspond to the indication device 170 described
 with an example of FIG. 1.In one example, FIGS. 2A through 2J illustrate an
 indication device that can be positioned on top of a surface of a vehicle. In
 another example, FIGS. 2K through 2R illustrate an indication device that
 can be positioned within a vehicle. While the examples of FIGS. 2A through
 2R depict the indication devices having specific configurations, an indication
 device can be constructed to have a variety of different shapes or sizes.
  [0041]      FIG. 2A illustrates an indication device 200 including a body 205
 and a base 210 (other components are not shown in FIG. 2A for purpose of
 simplicity). The body 205 can be formed of a translucent, semi-transparent,
 or transparent material that can be at least partially illuminated by one or
 more light sources. The light source(s) can be housed in the body 205
 and/or the base 210. As an addition or an alternative, the body 205 can
 include or be formed as a display device that can output content (e.g., a flat
 panel display, such as an LCD display or LED display). Based on control
 signals provided by a controller or a circuit of the indication device 200, the
 body 205 can illuminate light (e.g., via the light source) and/or display
 content in a specified manner. For example, the body 205 can illuminate in
 a particular color (e.g., blue), illuminate a particular pattern (e.g., hash
 pattern, polka dot), and/or illuminate in a particular sequence (e.g., blink
 periodically, fade in or fade out). The body 205 can be formed (e.g.,
 manufactured) in different shapes, such as a rectangular shape, trapezoidal
 shape, a slightly curved shape along a portion of the length of the body
 205, etc. The base 210 can also be shaped in accordance with the body 205
 and/or have at least a curved shape to match a curvature of a roof or upper
 region of a door of a vehicle.
  [0042]      In some examples, the body 205 can be shaped to have an
 overall length, L, that is substantially greater than the overall height, H, and
 the overall width, W (see FIG. 2D or 2E). In addition, in one example, the
 height can also be substantially greater than the width, so that the body
 205 is in the shape of a blade. For example, the overall length can be three,
 four, or five, etc., times greater than the overall height, while the overall
 height is three, four, or five, etc., times greater than the overall width. In
 this manner, the body 205 can have a surface that extends along the length
                                          16

WO 2015/175030                                                PCT/US2015/014406
 and height, thereby providing a large surface area that can be at least
 partially illuminated.
  [0043]      In the examples described in FIGS. 2A through 2J, a light
 source(s) can be provided or arranged within the body 205, along the edge
 of the body 205, and/or within the base 210 to illuminate the body 205 in a
 lighting or output configuration indicated by a user. For example, a light
 source or plurality of lights sources, such as an LED strip can be provided
 underneath the body 205 along a bottom edge of the body 205 (not shown
 in FIG. 2A), but within the base 210. The LED strip can be controlled, based
 on the output configuration data, to illuminate in a specific manner, thereby
 providing lighting on the body 205 and/or along the edge or perimeter of
 the body 205 (e.g., edge lighting). The body 205 can have a textured
 perimeter along its edge in order to enhance the edge lighting. In another
 example, light sources can be provided along the edge of the body 205 to
 provide edge lighting.
  [0044]      Referring to FIG. 2B, another example indication device 220 is
 illustrated in which the body 205 can include additional features for
 purposes of visually enhancing light configurations for a particular user. In
 one example, the body 205 can include an overlaying film 215 having a
 particular shape or design corresponding to an icon or trademark of the on
 demand service provider. The overlaying film 215 can be positioned on a
 surface of the body 205 and can be formed of a material to cause light to be
 outputted, for example, in a more prominent fashion, in the region of the
 film 215. In this manner, when the light source(s) of the indication device
 200 is controlled based on the output configuration, the body 205 can
 illuminate both the edge/perimeter of the body 205 and the overlaying film
 215 prominently.
  [0045]      Another example of the indication device 230 is illustrated in FIG.
 2C, in which the body 205 is unitarily formed or manufactured to include a
 gap 235 or recessed portion. The gap 235 can also be formed to have a
 shape of an icon or trademark of the on-demand service provider. When the
 indication device 230 is illuminated, for example, edge lighting can be
 provided along the perimeter of the body 205, including the perimeter along
 the gap 235. As another example, a separate lighting device and/or
                                         17

WO 2015/175030                                                PCT/US2015/014406
 material can also be inserted in the gap 235 for purposes of enhancing
 illumination (similar to FIG. 2B, for example, but instead of a film, the
 separate lighting device and/or material can be shaped to fit inside the gap
 235).
  [0046]      FIGS. 2D and 2E illustrate a side view of an indication device,
 such as described in FIGS. 1, 2A through 2C, and 2F through 2J. In FIG. 2D,
 the indication device 200 has a body 205 that is substantially flat along its
 length (e.g., flat faces) to maximize the edge lighting and/or the surface
 area for display and/or illumination. As seen in FIG. 2D, in one example, the
 overall width of the body 205 is substantially smaller than the overall height
 of the body 205 (and the overall length of the body 205 as seen in FIG. 2A).
  By minimizing the thickness or width of the body 205, the overall weight
 and bulkiness of the indication device 200 can also be minimized, thereby
 reducing the amount of force or fastening grip needed to fasten the
 indication device 200 to a vehicle.
  [0047]      Another benefit for shaping the body 205 to have the exemplary
 dimensions is to reduce the amount of material (e.g., plastic, glass, etc.)
 necessary for manufacturing the indication device 200, while maintaining a
 large surface area for purposes of maximizing lighting. Still further,
 reducing the overall size and weight of the indication device 200 can enable
 a service provider to easily and quickly fasten or remove the indication
 device 200 from the vehicle (e.g., the driver can do it by himself or herself).
 This can be important as a driver can quickly fasten the indication device
 200 to the roof of his vehicle, for example, when the driver is electing to go
 on-duty (e.g., be available to provide transport services), and similarly,
 quickly remove the indication device 200 when the driver will go off-duty.
  [0048]      Referring back to FIG. 2D, a cross sectional view of an exemplary
 indication device 200 illustrates the body 205 being inserted and held by a
 base 210. The body 205 can be inserted, fastened, removed, etc., from the
 base 210. The base 210 includes a fastening component 212 in which the
 base 210 can be fastened to a roof 240, for example, of a vehicle. The base
 210 can be configured to maintain the body 205 in a specific position or
 orientation (e.g., the body 205 is maintained at a fixed angle relative to the
 roof 240 of the vehicle).
                                         18

WO 2015/175030                                                PCT/US2015/014406
  [0049]      In another example, in FIG. 2E, a cross sectional view of an
 exemplary indication device 200 illustrates the body 205 being able to pivot
 relative to the roof 240 of the vehicle. In this example, the base 210 can
 include a locking mechanism 214, such as a locking set screw(s), to allow
 the body 205 to be pivoted in either direction relative to the base 210
 and/or the fastening component 212. The locking mechanism 214 can
 enable the indication device 200 to be configured on a case-by-case basis,
 so that a driver who operates one type of vehicle (and has a roof 240 with a
 different surface shape than another type of vehicle) can adjust the angle of
 the body 205.
  [0050]      FIG. 2F illustrates an indication device 260 showing components
 of the base 210 in one example. According to an example, the base 210 can
 hold the body 205 in place, while also providing a mechanism to maintain
 the indication device 260 in a proper position or orientation. For example,
 the base 210 can include a covering and underneath the covering, a
 compressible foam spacer 265 and a foot 270. The compressible foam
 spacer 265 can provide cushioning between the body 205 and the bottom of
 the base 210 and/or the roof of the vehicle (not shown) so that when the
 body 205 moves slightly during movement of the vehicle, the body 205 can
 be cushioned from being damaged. The foot 270 can be coupled to the base
 210 and/or the body 205 at a pivot point to enable the foot 270 to move to
 fit the contours/shape of the different roofs of vehicles. In one example, the
 foot 270 can also include or one or more fastening components, such as a
 physical latching device and/or a magnetic component(s), to engage and
 fasten the base 210 to the roof of the vehicle. The base 210 may have
 multiple feet 270, though only one is illustrated in FIG. 2F (e.g., a second
 foot on the right side of the indication device 260).
  [0051]      FIG. 2G illustrates another example of an indication device 280,
 similar to the indication device 230 of FIG. 2C. In FIG. 2G, the indication
 device includes a body and a base (or foot) 283. The body is unitarily
 formed to include a gap (such as seen in FIG. 2C), in which a lighting (LED)
 matrix or device 281 can be inserted. The LED matrix 281 can be
 illuminated based on the output configuration data specified by a user. The
 indication device 280, in this example, includes a light source (e.g., an LED
                                          19

WO 2015/175030                                                  PCT/US2015/014406
 strip) 285 that is positioned under the body and inserted within the foot 283
 for providing lighting for the body and/or the LED matrix 281. The power
 source 287, illustrated herein as a port with a wire, can provide power for
 the indication device 280 (e.g., provide power to the LED strip 285 and the
  LED matrix 281). In another example, the power source 287 can be an
 internal power source, such as a rechargeable battery.
  [0052]      FIG. 2H illustrates an example of an indication device (such as
 described in FIGS. 1 and 2A through 2G) that is positioned and fastened to
 a roof of a vehicle. The illustration of FIG. 2H, shows the indication device
 being illuminated along the edge and on the film or LED matrix of the
 indication device. Depending on examples, the indication device can be
 illuminated in this fashion for a duration of time in connection with a
 transport service. A user, in which a transport service has been arranged
 for, can be standing outside on a street corner, for example, awaiting for
 pickup. The user may have specified using the designated service
 application, a particular output configuration - e.g., yellow lighting. When
 the vehicle approaches the user, the driver can indicate via input "arriving
 now," on his or her driver device, thereby causing the indication device to
 output light in based on the user's output configuration data, as seen in
  FIG. 2H.
  [0053]      In one example, the indication device can be illuminated in a
 default color (e.g., white) while the driver is providing transport or driving
 to pick up a user (e.g., the indication device is in a "neutral state"). When
 the driver indicates "arriving now," the indication device can fade to the
 user's specified color (e.g., the indication device is in the "arrival state"). In
 addition, from this instance in time, as the driver waits for the user to enter
 the vehicle, the illumination can pulse or periodically fade in and fade out
 between the user's specified color and the default color (e.g., slowly
 transition from white to yellow for 2 seconds, maintain the yellow color for
 0.5 seconds, and then transition back to white for 2 seconds, etc.). While
 the driver waits, he or she has not indicated that the transport service has
 yet begun. During this time, the indication device can provide pulsating or
 transitioning illumination, as discussed (e.g., the indication device is in the
 "transition state"). After the user enters the vehicle, the indication device
                                         20

WO 2015/175030                                                 PCT/US2015/014406
 can be illuminated back to the default color or maintained in the user's
 specified color (e.g., the indication device is in a "transport state"). When
 the transport service is completed and the driver arrives at the user's
 destination, the driver can indicate on his or her device, "trip ended," and
 the indication device can again perform a transitioning illumination
 operation or output the user's specified color for a duration of time as the
 user exits, such as 10 seconds (e.g., the indication device is in a "goodbye
 state"). In this manner, the indication device can provide the user with a
 personalized experience that gives the user the appearance of a transport
 service that is specifically tailored for that user.
  [0054]      FIGS. 21 and 2J illustrate example patterns that can be displayed
 or illuminated on an indication device. In the example illustrated in FIG. 21,
 the indication device is provided on a roof of a vehicle (near a peripheral
 edge of the roof) and near a door, indicating the point of entry for the user
 for purposes of a transport service. The body of the indication device can
 include patterns that can be illuminated by the light source based on a
 user's output configuration. In FIG. 21, the pattern is a grid pattern that
 better illuminates the body in a color specified by the user. For example,
 when the indication device is to illuminate periodically (e.g., pulse from one
 color to another), the grid pattern can enhance the illumination for the user
 along with the edge lighting. In another example, FIG. 2J illustrates fade
 pattern or a grid and fade pattern.
  [0055]      FIGS. 2K through 20 illustrate another example indication device,
 such as described in FIG. 1. While the indication device illustrated in FIGS.
 2A through 2J is shaped to be positioned on top of a vehicle, for example,
 the indication device 290 can be shaped to be positioned proximate to a
 window or windshield of the vehicle, such as illustrated in FIGS. 2M, 2N,
 and/or 20.
  [0056]      Referring to FIG. 2K, the indication device 290 can have an
 overall length, L, an overall width, W, and an overall height, H, with the
 length being significantly greater than the width and the height, and the
 width being greater than the height. The indication device 290 can include a
 base 291 and a body 293, which has a length that is shorter than the
 overall length, L, but has a width and a height that is similar to the overall
                                          21

WO 2015/175030                                               PCT/US2015/014406
 width, W, and the overall height, H, as the indication device 290. The body
 293 can include a facade or surface 294 that extends along the length and
 the width of the body 293. This facade or surface 294 can be composed of
 material that enables a light source(s) included in the body 293 (and/or the
 base 291) to illuminate at least a portion of the facade 294. For example,
 the facade 294 can include or be composed of a diffusion film or a diffusion
 mask, and can be held in place by a gasket that makes up at least a portion
 of a perimeter or housing of the body 293. Depending on implementation,
 the facade 294 can also have different patterns or textures to enhance the
 illumination when light is emitted by the indication device 290.
  [0057]      The base 291 of the indication device 290 can be shaped to
 extend along at least a portion of the length of the body 293 and at least a
 portion of the width of the body 293. In one example, the base 291 can
 have a greater length (and/or width) than the body 293, such as illustrated
 in FIG. 2L. The indication device 290 can also include one or more fastening
 mechanisms to enable the indication device 290 to adhere or fasten to a
 surface, so that the facade 294 faces the surface when the indication device
 290 is attached to that surface. For example, in FIG. 2K and 2L, a first
 fastening mechanism 295 can be coupled to a first end portion of the base
 291 (that extends further out lengthwise than the body 293) and can be
 positioned adjacent to a first end portion of the body 293, while a second
 fastening mechanism 297 can be coupled to a second end portion of the
 base 291 (that also extends further out lengthwise than the body 293) and
 be positioned adjacent to a second end portion of the body 293. The
 fastening mechanisms 295, 297 can include adhesives on their surfaces
 (e.g., tape, suction cups, sticky material for adhesion to glass, hook and
 loop fasteners, etc.) to enable the indication device 290 to adhere to a
 surface, such as an inner surface of a windshield 298 of a vehicle, such as
 illustrated in FIG. 2M. By enabling the indication device 290 to be positioned
 in such a manner, light can be emitted or outputted from the facade 294 in
 the direction toward the windshield 298.
  [0058]      Each of the fastening mechanisms 295, 297 can also include an
 attachment mechanism(s) to couple to respective first end and second end
 portions of the base 291 (see FIG. 2L). The attachment mechanisms, such
                                        22

WO 2015/175030                                                  PCT/US2015/014406
 as clasps, male-female mating mechanisms, and/or magnets, etc., can
 enable the fastening mechanisms 295, 297 to detach from the base 291. In
 such an example, the driver can first attach the indication device 290 to a
 surface of a window using the fastening mechanisms 295, 297, such as
 illustrated in FIG. 2M. When the driver is no longer using the indication
 device 290 and wants to put it away, for example, the driver can grab the
 handle 292 (which extends from a rear surface of the base 291) to take off
 the indication device 290 from the window. The two fastening mechanisms
 295, 297 can remain adhered to the window while decoupling from the base
 291, so that the base 291 and the body 293 of the indication device 290 can
 be removed from the window. In this manner, the driver can easily and
 quickly attach and take off the indication device 290 from the window at the
 same position. Still further, in some examples, only one fastening
 mechanism may be included in the indication device. In the examples
 illustrated in FIGS. 2K through 2M, however, having two fastening
 mechanisms 295, 297 can provide additional balance and stability for the
 indication device 290 when mounted or adhered to a surface of a window.
  [0059]      In some examples, at least one or more of the base 291, the
 body 293, or the fastening mechanisms 295, 297 can include or house one
 or more electrical components (e.g., light source(s), device controller
 circuitry, ports/interfaces, wires, electrical contacts, etc.). For example, as
 illustrated in FIG. 2L, the fastening mechanism 297 can include circuitry,
 such as a power and/or a data interface, to receive power from a cable (or
 to house a power source) and/or to receive data from the computing device,
 such as a driver's device. The fastening mechanism 297 can include a first
 power and/or data connection (e.g., a first set of contacts) to mate with a
 second set of contacts 296 of the base 291. In this manner, the fastening
 mechanism 297 can enable power and/or data to be provided to the
 indication device 290 when connected to the base 291 (e.g., when the base
 291 and the body 293 are attached or mounted, via the one or more
 fastening mechanisms 295, 297, to the surface of a window).
  [0060]      As an addition or an alternative, different fastening mechanisms
 can be used to attach the indication device 290 to a vehicle. For example, in
  FIG. 2N, the indication device 290 may not have the set of fastening
                                         23

WO 2015/175030                                                PCT/US2015/014406
 mechanisms 295, 297, as described in FIGS. 2K through 2M, but instead
 can have one or more fastening mechanisms 299a, 299b that attach the
 indication device 290 to a peripheral edge or surface of the interior of a
 vehicle so that the facade 294 faces and is proximate to the inner surface of
 the windshield. Each fastening mechanisms 299a, 299b can correspond to a
 set of magnets or a set of other coupling devices in which a first magnet or
 coupling device remains attached to the peripheral edge of the vehicle and a
 second corresponding magnet or coupling device is coupled to the base 291
 or the body 293 of the indication device 290. In this manner, when the
 indication device 290 is properly attached to the peripheral edge of the
 vehicle, the indication device 290 can be positioned with respect to the
 inner surface of the windshield similar to the position of the indication
 device 290 as illustrated in FIG. 2M.
  [0061]      In another example, referring to FIG. 20, the fastening
 mechanism 299c can be a hinge (or multiple hinges) that can attach to the
 peripheral edge or surface of the interior of a vehicle so that the facade 294
 faces and is proximate to the inner surface of the windshield. The fastening
 mechanism 299c can enable the indication device 290 to rotate about its
 length to be hidden from view when not in use (e.g., rotate about its length
 so that the facade 294 moves away from the inner surface of the
 windshield. In such examples, of FIGS. 2N and 20, power and/or data can
 be provided via the one or more fastening mechanisms 299a, 299b, 299c,
 or can be provided through a separate cable and/or wireless interface.
  [0062]      The indication device 290 can also be shaped in different ways,
 depending on variations. For example, the facade 294 of the indication
 device 290 can be substantially flat or can have a slight curve along its
 length, such as illustrated in FIG. 2M, so that the indication device 290 can
 be substantially flush to a vehicle's windshield (which is also slightly curved)
 when the indication device 290 is mounted or adhered to the inner surface
 of the windshield. In another example, the base 291 and the body 293 can
 be composed of material that is at least semi-flexible (e.g., flexible plastics,
 rubber or rubber-like materials, etc.) so as to enable the indication device
 290 to flex along its length, width, and/or height.
                                        24

WO 2015/175030                                                PCT/US2015/014406
  [0063]      Depending on implementation, the indication device 290 can
 have a variety of different light sources and/or different arrangements for
 the light source(s). In one example, the indication device 290 can be backlit
 using different light-producing devices, can include an array of light
 elements, such as bulbs, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), light-emitting
 electrochemical cells (LECs), and/or can include a display device, such as a
 touch-sensitive display device, a LED display, an liquid crystal display (LCD)
 device, etc. Based on power and/or control signals received from a
 computing device, such as the driver's device, the indication device 290 can
 be illuminated in a particular manner. In another example, the indication
 device 290 can be pre-programmed to illuminate in a particular manner
 when the indication device 290 is turned on, without being connected to or
 without communicating with the driver's device or the transport
 personalization system of FIG. 1.
  [0064]      For example, FIGS. 2P through 2R illustrate different illumination
 arrangements and/or illumination sequences for an indication device, such
 as described with respect to FIGS. 1 through 20. The examples shown in
  FIGS. 2P through 2R depict the front surface or facade (e.g., the facade 294
 of the indication device 290 in FIG. 2K) with the facade facing outwards
 from the inside of a vehicle. In such examples, the indication device 290
 can be positioned to abut or be proximate to the inner surface of a
 windshield, such as near a lateral side of the passenger-side of the interior
 of the vehicle. The arrows indicate, in some examples, the animation or
 sequence of illumination of the indication device. Such an animation or
 sequence of illumination can be caused by control signals from the driver's
 device (via the output configuration specified by a user, such as described
 in FIG. 1) or can be pre-programmed in a memory accessible by the device
 controller of the indication device 290. For example, such illumination
 sequences can be displayed when the driver is approaching the pickup
 location of the user and/or when the driver is waiting at the pickup location
 for the user to enter the vehicle. The illumination sequences can be
 repeated over and over until the indication device 290 is turned off or until
 the state of the transport service or driver changes.
                                        25

WO 2015/175030                                                  PCT/US2015/014406
  [0065]      Referring to FIG. 2P, the facade of the indication device 290 can
 include a printed pattern or design (e.g., markings on the facade itself) or
 can display portions of the design when the light source(s) is illuminated
 underneath the facade (e.g., in the body 293). The design can enhance the
 manner in which the indication device 290 is illuminated. In one example,
 the animation or sequence of illumination can be in a direction going from
 the bottom of the device to the top of the device so that portions of the
 facade can be illuminated at different instances in time. In other
 implementations, the facade can have or display other designs or no design.
  [0066]      In another example, in FIG. 2Q, the indication device 290 can
 enable discrete portion(s) or segment(s) of the facade to be illuminated in a
 particular animation or sequence. In this example, the direction of the
 illumination sequence can start by first illuminating the light source(s) in the
 middle area of the facade and then dynamically turning off those light
 source(s) and illuminating the light source(s) towards positioned above and
 below those light source(s), so that two portions of the facade are
 illuminated at different instances in time. Still further, in the example of
  FIG. 2R, the indication device 290 can be enabled to dynamically illuminate
 different portions of the facade by illuminating different light source(s) of an
 array and/or controlling the brightness levels of the light source(s).
  METHODOLOGY
  [0067]      FIG. 3 illustrates an example method for providing configuration
 information for controlling an indication device for use with an on-demand
 service. A method such as described by an example of FIG. 3 can be
 implemented using, for example, components described with an example of
  FIG. 1. Accordingly, references made to elements of FIG. 1 are for purposes
 of illustrating a suitable element or component for performing a step or sub
 step being described.
  [0068]      Referring to FIG. 3, the on-demand service system can arrange
 for a transport service to be provided by a user (310). The user can provide
 a transport request using a designated service application on her device and
 the on-demand service system can programmatically select a driver for that
 user. A transport personalization system that is a part of the on-demand
 service system and/or in communication with the on-demand service
                                          26

WO 2015/175030                                                 PCT/US2015/014406
 system can determine that the transport has been arranged for the user,
 and determine whether that user has specified an output configuration for
 an indication device (320). For example, the transport personalization
 system can determine the arranged transport service information (e.g., get
 the trip identifier), determine a user ID for that user, perform a lookup in a
 client user database for the user's profile using the user ID, and determine
 whether the user has specified in the profile a particular output
 configuration for personalizing the transport.
  [0069]      If the user has specified an output configuration, the transport
 personalization system can retrieve or determine the output configuration
 from the user's profile (360) and provide data corresponding to the output
 configuration to the driver's device (370). For example, the transport
 personalization system can determine the driver's identifier that is to
 provide the transport for the user from the arranged transport service
 information and identify the driver's device. If the user has not specified an
 output configuration, on the other hand, the transport personalization
 system can provide a message (e.g., an in-app message) to the user's
 device prompting the user to provide an output configuration for the
 indication device (330).
  [0070]      The prompt can indicate to the user that the user may specify the
 output configuration if the user would like. The user can interact with the in
 app message (e.g., that is displayed by the designated service application)
 in order to access the different configuration(s) that can be selected by the
 user. If the user inputs the output configuration (340), the transport
 personalization system can receive and determine the output configuration
 (360) and store the output configuration with the user's profile for future
 use. The transport personalization system can then transmit the output
 configuration to the appropriate driver device (370).
  [0071]      If the user chooses not to input or select an output configuration,
 the transport personalization system can determine that the default output
 configuration is to be used by the driver (350). In that case, the transport
 personalization system can transmit the default output configuration to the
 driver device (370). As an alternative, the transport personalization system
 does not transmit any output configuration to the driver device, and the
                                          27

WO 2015/175030                                                 PCT/US2015/014406
 driver device automatically uses the default output configuration. The
 driver's device can use the output configuration to adjust the illumination
 and/or display of the indication device for purposes of providing
 personalized transport services for the user (e.g., by providing control
 signals from the driver's device to the indication device using a
 communication interface).
  [0072]      As an addition or an alternative, the system and/or the driver
 service application can determine the output configuration used to control
 the indication devices (e.g., without user control or preference). For
 example, the output configuration can be based on the current state of the
 transport service without taking into consideration user-specified colors,
 patterns, or sequences of illumination. The driver service application can
 store the output configuration data with predetermined transport
 service/driver status information so that the driver service application can
 control the indication device when it detects a certain state of the transport
 service or driver. In other examples where the system determines the state,
 the system can transmit predetermined output configuration data to the
 driver device corresponding to the detected state in order to cause the
 driver's device to control the indication device accordingly.
  [0073]      Still further, in some examples, the indication device can include
 memory that store pre-programmed data that controls the manner in which
 the indication device illuminates its facade or blade-like surfaces. The
 indication device may receive state information from the driver device and
 the device controller of the indication device can control the illumination
 based on the received state information. In another example, a connection
 between the indication device and the driver's device may not be necessary
 as the indication device can illuminate in a specified pre-programmed
 manner when the indicating device is turned on (such that the illumination
 is not based on user-specified preferences or the state of the transport
 service).
 USER INTERFACE
  [0074]      FIGS. 4A and 4B are example user interfaces depicting a service
 application that is operated on a computing device. The user interfaces 400,
 420, such as described in examples of FIGS. 4A and 4B, respectively, can
                                         28

WO 2015/175030                                                PCT/US2015/014406
 be provided using, for example, components described with an example of
  FIG. 1. In one example, the user interface 400, 420 can each correspond to
 a user interface that is displayed on a mobile computing device of a client
 device as part of a designated service application.
  [0075]      In FIG. 4A, a service application running on a client device can
 provide a user interface to enable a user to update or modify the user's
 profile (or account) using the client device. The user can access the user's
 profile and make edits to the profile by interacting with the service
 application. In one example, the user can adjust one or more preferences in
 the user's profile, such as sign (or output) preferences for an indication
 device. The user interface 400 can display a sign preference user interface
 410 in which the user can adjust one or more output configurations for an
 indication device. For example, the user can adjust the color 413, the text
 (if any or if possible) 415, and/or the pattern 417 of the output
 configuration.
  [0076]      When the user selects the feature 413 to adjust or select the
 color, the user interface 420 of FIG. 4B can be displayed on the client
 device. The user interface 420 can include a region 423 showing the current
 color selected by the user and a selection bar 427 in which the user can
 move the color indicator 425 to select the color. The selection bar 427 can
 display a spectrum of colors (e.g., from red to orange to yellow to green to
 blue to violet, etc., and anything in between) from left to right, for example,
 and when the user moves the color indicator 425 along the selection bar
 427, the selected color can dynamically change in the region 423. The user
 can select any color from a full RBG spectrum. Once the user accepts the
 color by selecting a "accept" feature on the user interface 420 (not
 illustrated in FIG. 4B), the user interface 400 can be displayed again to the
 user. The selected color can be presented in the rectangular region of the
 feature 413 showing the current selected color for the user. In addition, the
 user's configured preferences for the output configuration can be stored
 with the user's profile or account so that the transport personalization
 system can access the user's specific configuration without prompting the
 user. The user does not have to provide configuration information again
 unless the user wants to make changes.
                                          29

WO 2015/175030                                                PCT/US2015/014406
  [0077]      Although not illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4B, when the user opens
 or launches the service application on his or her client device at a later
 time, the service application can also be tailored to the user's selected color.
  For example, a welcome message in a badge graphic can be provided on
 the display in the selected color, thereby providing the user with a full
 personalized experience from the initial launching of the application to the
 transport service itself. The user can edit or change the selected color at
 any time by accessing the user's profile from the client device or by logging
 in to the user's account from another device.
  HARDWARE DIAGRAM
  [0078]      FIG. 5 is a block diagram that illustrates a computer system upon
 which examples described herein may be implemented. For example, in the
 context of FIG. 1, the system 100 may be implemented using a computer
 system such as described by FIG. 5. The system 100 may also be
 implemented using a combination of multiple computer systems as
 described by FIG. 5.
  [0079]      In one implementation, the computer system 500 includes
 processing resources 510, a main memory 220, a read-only memory (ROM)
 530, a storage device 540, and a communication interface 550. The
 computer system 500 includes at least one processor 510 for processing
 information and a main memory 520, such as a random access memory
 (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, for storing information and
 instructions to be executed by the processor 510. The main memory 520
 also may be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate
 information during execution of instructions to be executed by the processor
 510. The computer system 500 may also include the ROM 530 or other
 static storage device for storing static information and instructions for the
 processor 510. The storage device 540, such as a solid-state device, a
 magnetic disk, or an optical disk, is provided for storing information and
 instructions. For example, the storage device 540 can correspond to a
 computer-readable medium that stores sign (output configuration)
 instructions 542 for performing operations discussed with respect to FIGS. 1
 through 4B. In another example, the storage device 540 can store user
 and/or profiles or accounts, such as discussed with respect to FIGS. 1
                                          30

WO 2015/175030                                                PCT/US2015/014406
 through 4B. The processor 510 can perform a search of a database of user
 profiles or accounts to determine whether a user has specified output
 configurations for controlling an indication device during the progress of a
 transport service, such as described with FIGS. 1 through 2B.
  [0080]      The communication interface 550 can enable the computer
 system 500 to communicate with one or more networks 580 (e.g., cellular
 network) through use of the network link (wireless and/or using a wire).
 Using the network link, the computer system 500 can communicate with a
 plurality of devices, such as the mobile computing devices of the clients and
 service providers. According to some examples, the computer system 500
 can receive configuration information 552 from a client device when the
 user provides a selection or configures the output configuration for an
 indication device via the network link. The processor 510 can associate the
 configuration information 552 with the user's profile and store the
 configuration information in the storage device 540, for example, and
 provide the configuration information to the driver's device if a transport
 service is arranged for that user. If a transport service is arranged for the
 user and a driver, the processor 510 can identify the user's configuration
 information 552 from memory, for example, and transmit the configuration
 information 552 to the specific driver's device. The driver's device can use
 the configuration information to control the illumination or display of the
 indication device in possession of the driver.
  [0081]      The computer system 500 can also include a display device 560,
 such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), an LCD monitor, or a television set, for
 example, for displaying graphics and information to a user. An input
 mechanism 570, such as a keyboard that includes alphanumeric keys and
 other keys, can be coupled to the computer system 500 for communicating
 information and command selections to the processor 510. Other non
 limiting, illustrative examples of input mechanisms 570 include a mouse, a
 trackball, touch-sensitive screen, or cursor direction keys for communicating
 direction information and command selections to the processor 510 and for
 controlling cursor movement on the display 560.
  [0082]      Examples described herein are related to the use of the computer
 system 500 for implementing the techniques described herein. According to
                                        31

WO 2015/175030                                                 PCT/US2015/014406
 one example, those techniques are performed by the computer system 500
 in response to the processor 510 executing one or more sequences of one
 or more instructions contained in the main memory 520, such as the sign
 instructions 542. Such instructions may be read into the main memory 520
 from another machine-readable medium, such as the storage device 540.
  Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in the main memory
 520 causes the processor 510 to perform the process steps described
 herein. In alternative implementations, hard-wired circuitry may be used in
 place of or in combination with software instructions to implement examples
 described herein. Thus, the examples described are not limited to any
 specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
  [0083]      FIG. 6 is a block diagram that illustrates a mobile computing
 device upon which examples described herein may be implemented. In one
 example, a mobile computing device 600 may correspond to a mobile
 computing device, such as a cellular device that is capable of telephony,
 messaging, and data services. The mobile computing device 600 can
 correspond to a client device or a driver device. Examples of such devices
 include smartphones, handsets or tablet devices for cellular carriers. The
 mobile computing device 600 includes a processor 610, memory resources
 620, a display device 630 (e.g., such as a touch-sensitive display device),
 one or more communication sub-systems 640 (including wireless
 communication sub-systems), input mechanisms 650 (e.g., an input
 mechanism can include or be part of the touch-sensitive display device),
 and one or more location detection mechanisms (e.g., GPS component)
 660. In one example, at least one of the communication sub-systems 640
 sends and receives cellular data over data channels and voice channels.
  [0084]      The processor 610 is configured with software and/or other logic
 to perform one or more processes, steps and other functions described with
 implementations, such as described by FIGS. 1 through 5, and elsewhere in
 the application. The processor 610 is configured, with instructions and data
 stored in the memory resources 620, to operate a service application as
 described in FIGS. 1 through 5. For example, instructions for operating the
 client service application (when the mobile computing device 600
 corresponds to a client device) or the driver service application (when the
                                         32

 mobile computing device 600 corresponds to a driver device) can be stored
 in the memory resources 620 of the mobile computing device 600.
  [0085]      The processor 610 can provide a variety of content to the display
 630 by executing instructions and/or applications that are stored in the
 memory resources 620. One or more user interfaces 615 can be provided
 by the processor 610, such as a user interface for the service application. A
 user, for example, can operate a mobile computing device (such as the
 mobile computing device 600) to operate a client service application. The
 GPS component 670 can determine location information, such as the current
 location information 665 of the computing device 600. The user can make a
 transport request using the location information 665, as a pick up location,
 for example, and provide the transport request to the on-demand service
 system via the communication sub-systems 640. The user can also operate
 a user interface 615 provided as part of the service application in order to
 input output configuration preferences of the user. The configuration
 information 645 can be provided to the on-demand service system and
 stored with the user's profile.
  [0086]      In another example, for a driver device, the memory resources
 620 can store data corresponding to the driver service application. The GPS
 component 670 can determine location information, such as the current
 location information 665 of the computing device 600, and the operation of
 the driver service application can cause the location information 665 to be
 periodically determined and communicated to the on-demand service
 system (and/or the transport personalization system) via the
 communication sub-systems 640. In addition, for a driver device, the driver
 service application can receive the configuration information 645 (for a user
 that the driver is to provide transports service for) from the on-demand
 service system (and/or the transport personalization system) and based on
 the configuration information 645, control an indication device (not shown
 in FIG. 6) that is connected (e.g., via a wire or wirelessly) with the mobile
 computing device 600. While FIG. 6 is illustrated for a mobile computing
 device, one or more examples may be implemented on other types of
 devices, including full-functional computers, such as laptops and desktops
 (e.g., PC).

  [0087]      FIG. 7 is a block diagram that illustrates an indication device
 upon which examples described herein may be implemented. For example,
 in the context of FIGS. 1 through 2R, an indication device may be
 implemented using the device such as described by FIG. 7. The indication
 device 700 can comprise a base and a body, and other housing features,
 such as described in FIGS. 2A through 2R. The indication device 700 can
 also include within or as part of the base, the body, and/or the fastening
 mechanisms, a controller 710, a communication interface 720, a light
 source(s) 730, and a power source 740.
  [0088]      The power source 740 provides power to the components of the
 indication device 700. The power source 740 can be an internal power
 source, such as a battery, and/or an external power source (e.g., provided
 by a power source of the vehicle of the driver in possession of the indication
 device 700 or the driver's device). The light source 730 can be one or more
 individual light sources, an electroluminescence (EL) element(s), and/or a
 display device, as described with FIGS. 1 through 2R.
  [0089]      In some examples, the indication device 700 can receive control
 data 725 via the communication interface 720 from a wirelessly connected
 (or connected via wire) driver device (not shown in FIG. 7). The control
 data 725 can be provided by the driver device in order to control the
 illumination and/or display of the indication device 700 based on the user's
 specified output configuration information. For example, the control data
 725 can cause the controller 710 to illuminate the light source(s) 730 in a
 particular color, in a particular pattern, and/or operate the light source(s) in
 different states as described, for example, in FIGS. 1 through 2R. The
 indication device 700 can also include other components (not shown in FIG.
 7), such as one or more ports or contacts, one or more sensors (e.g., an
 INU, a GPS receiver), speakers, one or more switches to turn on or off the
 indication device 700, etc.
  [0090]      It is contemplated for examples described herein to extend to
 individual elements and concepts described herein, independently of other
 concepts, ideas or system, as well as for examples to include combinations
 of elements recited anywhere in this application. Although examples are
 described in detail herein with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is
                                         34

 to be understood that the concepts are not limited to those precise
 examples. Accordingly, it is intended that the scope of the concepts be
 defined by the following claims and their equivalents. Furthermore, it is
 contemplated that a particular feature described either individually or as
 part of an example can be combined with other individually described
 features, or parts of other examples, even if the other features and
 examples make no mentioned of the particular feature. Thus, the absence
 of describing combinations should not preclude having rights to such
 combinations.
