    Field of the Invention
  5 The present invention relates to a method and system for charging a light
    tower.
    Background
10  Light towers are useful for various applications, particularly outdoor illumination.
    For instance, portable light towers are often used in the area of mining or
    construction for illuminating outdoor areas when operations are conducted at
    night time.
15  Diesel-powered LED light towers are known. The cost of fuel to power such
    light towers is typically between AUD$8,000 - $20,000 a year for each light
    tower. Further, such diesel-powered LED light towers are not particularly
    environmentally friendly. An alternative system for powering light towers is
    desirable.

    According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a mine site
    illumination system comprising:
                a battery-powered light tower-to illuminate at least a portion of the mine
    site;
10              a charging station for charging an energy storage unit;
                a charging service vehicle capable of transporting the energy storage
    unit between the charging station and the battery-powered light tower;
                wherein the energy storage unit is capable of:
                (a) electrically or electromagnetically coupling to a battery of the battery

20  Also disclosed herein is a system for charging a light tower, the system
    comprising:
                the light tower;
                a first energy storage unit capable of delivering power to the light tower
    when connected to the light tower;
25              a charging station for charging the first energy storage unit;
                a charging service vehicle capable of transporting the first energy
    storage unit between the charging station and the light tower;
                wherein the system is arranged to deliver charge from the charging
    station to the light tower via the first energy storage unit.
30  By providing a light tower that can be powered by charge delivered from a
    charging station, the present invention may provide the advantage of avoiding
    the use of diesel-powered LED light towers, and thus the costs associated
    10175846_1(GHMaters) P105929.AU.1

                                              -4
    therewith.
    Furthermore, by delivering power to the light tower using a charging service
    vehicle, which may already be used to provide power to other equipment, the
  5 present invention may provide the advantage of saving on costs otherwise
    incurred by re-fuelling or delivering power exclusively to one or more light
    towers. In other words, the light towers can form part of a group of electrically
    or battery-powered equipment regularly serviced by one or more charging
    service vehicles.
10
    The light tower may comprise a second energy storage unit arranged to power
    a light source of the light tower. In this embodiment, the first energy storage unit
    may be associated with, or mounted to, the charging service vehicle. Further,
    the first energy storage unit may be capable of charging the second energy
is  storage unit while installed in or on the charging service vehicle when
    electrically or electromagnetically coupled to the second energy storage unit.
    Alternatively, the system may comprise a second energy storage unit capable
    of delivering power to the light tower, wherein the first and second energy
20  storage units are interchangeably installable in or on the light tower and each
    energy storage unit capable of powering a light source of the light tower when
    installed. Thus, according to embodiment, instead of recharging an energy
    storage unit installed in the light tower, the energy storage unit can be replaced
    by another energy storage unit when required. The charging station may be
25  capable of charging both the first energy storage unit and the second energy
    storage unit.
    The system may comprise a further energy storage unit capable of being
    charged at the charging station and delivering power to the light tower. In this
30  embodiment, the first (or second) and further energy storage units may be
    interchangeably mountable to the charging service vehicle. In other words,
    instead of recharging the first (or second) energy storage unit at the charging
    10175846_1(GHMaters) P105929.AU.1

                                                -5
    station, the first (or second) energy storage unit can be interchanged with the
    further energy storage unit.
    Further, the charging service vehicle may be capable of transporting each
  5 energy storage unit between the charging station and the light tower. Thus, the
    charging service vehicle can then carry the further energy storage unit to the or
    another light tower, or to other equipment that needs recharging.
    The charging station may comprise a source of renewable energy, wherein the
io  source of renewable comprises any one from the following group: a solar power
    system; an ocean power hydroelectric generator system; a wind power system;
    other source of renewable energy.
    By delivering power from a renewable source of energy to the charging service
is  vehicle, and ultimately to the light tower, the present invention may provide the
    advantage of utilising "clean" energy and significantly reducing costs compared
    to diesel-powered LED light towers.
    The light tower may comprise one or more of the following: at least one light
20  emitting diode as the light source; a hollow mast supporting the light source and
    encapsulating at least one cable for delivering power from the energy storage
    unit to the light source; a 12kWh lithium ion battery as the rechargeable battery.
    The charging service vehicle may be a truck. The charging service vehicle may
25  be an electrically powered vehicle. The charging service vehicle may be used to
    carry one or more energy storage units to several locations to charge other
    electrically powered equipment.
    Also disclosed herein is a method of charging a light tower using a system, the
30  method comprising:
                charging a first energy storage unit with power from a power source at a
    charging station;
    10175846_1(GHMaters) P105929.AU.1

                                                      -6
               driving a charging service vehicle carrying the energy storage unit to a
   location where the first energy storage unit can deliver power to a light tower to
   power a light source of the light tower; and
               delivering power to the light tower with power from the first energy
 5 storage unit.
   The method may comprise charging the first energy storage unit with power
   from the power source at the charging station while the energy storage unit is
   carried by the charging service vehicle.
10
   The method may comprise electrically coupling the first energy storage unit to a
   second energy storage unit installed in the light tower and arranged to provide
   power to a light source of the light tower. The first energy storage unit can then
   recharge the second energy storage unit.
15 Alternatively, the second energy storage unit may be removably installed in the
   light tower. The first and second energy storage units may also be substantially
   the same. Consequently, the first and second energy storage units can be
   interchangeably installed in the light tower.
20 The method may comprise driving the charging service vehicle carrying the first
   (or second) energy storage unit to the charging station. The method may then
   comprise interchanging the first (or second) energy storage unit with a further
   energy storage unit charged at the charging station. Thus, instead of recharging
   the first (or second) energy storage unit at the charging station, the first (or
25 second) energy storage unit can be interchanged with the further energy
   storage unit.
   The present invention further provides a method of illuminating a mine site, the
30 method comprising:
                            providing mine site illumination system comprising:

                                      wherein the energy storage unit is capable of:
                                      (a) electrically or electromagnetically coupling to a battery
                             of the battery-operated light tower in order to recharge the battery
                             of the light tower; or
io                                    (b) being exchanged with a battery of the light tower carried
                             by the charging service vehicle such that the battery-powered light
                             tower is capable of being powered by the energy storage unit;

20  Detailed Description
    Throughout this specification, the term "light tower" is used to mean a generally
    tall upstanding structure comprising lights at an upper end portion of the
    structure to illuminate a surrounding area. Light towers are typically, though not
25  exclusively, used for outdoor illumination, and may be portable.
    Figure 1 shows a system 100 for charging a light tower 102. The system 100
    comprises the light tower 102, a first energy storage unit 104, a charging station
    106 and a charging service vehicle 108. The first energy storage unit 104 is
    capable of delivering power to the light tower 104 when connected to the light
30  tower 102, and is capable being charged at the charging station 106. The
    charging service vehicle 108 is capable of transporting the first energy storage
    unit 104 between the charging station and the light tower 102. The system 100
    10175846_1(GHMaters) P105929.AU.1

                                            -9
    is arranged to deliver charge from the charging station 106 to the light tower
    102 via the first energy storage unit 104.
    According to a first embodiment shown in Figures 1 and 2, the first energy
  5 storage unit is in the form of a rechargeable battery 104 mounted on the
    charging service vehicle 108. Further, the charging service vehicle is in the form
    of a service truck 108 capable of supplying power from the battery 104 to other
    equipment, such as but not limited to high-powered mining equipment. In this
    embodiment, the light tower 102 comprises a second energy storage unit also
io  in the form of a rechargeable battery 110, which is installed in the light tower
    102 to power one or more light sources 112 of the light tower 102.
    The charging station or dock 106 may be embodied as a fixed charging location
    (as shown in Figure 1) or may be transportable. The charging dock 106
    comprises a connector 107 for connecting to the battery 104 carried by the
is  truck 108 to supply charge to the battery 104. The charging dock 106 may
    receive power by being directly connected to an electrical power supply grid.
    Preferably, the charging dock 106 receives power from a renewable energy
    power source, such as a solar power system 113, a wave energy electrical
    power generation system 114 or wind power system (not shown).
20
    Alternatively, if the charging dock 106 is transportable, the charging dock 106
    may receive power from a portable power supply, such as a generator set or
    another energy storage unit. In that case, the charging dock 106 may comprise
    a hand-held device that can transfer power from a portable power supply to the
25  battery 104 carried by the truck 108, or even directly to the battery 110 of the
    light tower 102. For example, in emergency situations where the light tower
    102 requires immediate charging but the truck 108 is not available, a generator
    set or other battery can be towed to the site of the light tower 102, and a
    portable charger, such as an emergency "fast" charger, can be used to transfer
30  power from the generator set or battery to the battery of the light tower 102. The
    fast charger may be hand-held. The generator set or battery that is towed
    preferably also has sufficient capacity to fully recharge the battery 110 of the
    10175846_1(GHMaters) P105929.AU.1

                                             - 10
    light tower
    In this embodiment, the battery 104 carried by the truck 108 generally remains
    on the truck 108. Similarly, the battery 110 of the light tower 112 generally
  5 remains on the light tower. When (or close to when) the battery 110 of the light
    tower requires recharging, the truck 108 can be driven to the light tower 102 to
    recharge the battery 110 by connecting the battery 104 of the truck to the
    battery 110 of the light tower. For example, as shown in Figure 2, the battery
    104 can recharge the battery 110 by connecting an electrical cable 202 through
io  power points 118 and 120 of the light tower 102 and truck 108, respectively.
    The battery 104 of the truck 108 in this embodiment has sufficient capacity to
    fully recharge the battery 110 of the light tower.
    After servicing the light tower 102 and optionally other battery-powered light
is  towers or other equipment, the truck 108 can be driven back to the charging
    dock 106 for its own battery 104 to be recharged. When (or close to when) the
    battery 104 of the truck requires recharging, the truck 108 can be driven to the
    charging dock 106. There, its battery 104 can be connected via an electrical
    cable 122 to power point 120 to a power source (not shown) at the charging
20  dock 106 to receive charge from the power source.
    With reference to Figures 2, 3A and 3B, further features of the light tower 102
    according to a specific embodiment will be described. The light sources 112 of
    the light tower are in the form of light emitting diodes (LEDs). The light tower
25  also 102 comprises a telescopic mast 124 supporting the LEDs 112, which can
    be adjusted to adjust the height of the LEDs 112 according to desired use. In
    this particular embodiment, when the mast 124 is lengthened to its maximum
    height, the LEDs 112 can be mounted over 9m above the ground. However a
    person skilled in the art will appreciate that the mast 124 can be configured to
30  extend to various maximum heights. The LEDs 112 may have a total output of
    2400W, which is believed to be able to illuminate an area of up to 2300 square
    metres of ground area when the mast 124 is fully extended.
    10175846_1(GHMaters) P105929.AU.1

                                           - 11
    The LEDs in this embodiment are mounted on an adjustable support head 125.
    As shown in Figure detail in Figure 3B, the support head 125 comprises
    generally horizontal arms 127 that are rotatable about a common axis A. Each
  5 arm 127 further supports at a distal end the light sources 112 such that rotation
    of the arms about the axis A causes the light sources 112 also to rotate about
    the axis A, thus changing the area of illumination. Furthermore, the support
    head 125 is also rotatable about a generally vertical axis B so that the light
    sources 112 are also rotatable about the axis B.
10
    The mast 124 in this embodiment is hollow. The light tower 102 may thus be
    configured such that all cables, piping and other necessary electrical or other
    components for delivering power from the battery 110 to the LEDs is
    encapsulated within the mast 112. This reduces the risk of entanglement of the
is  cables and may provide the advantage of a robust exterior that can withstand
    harsh environmental forces.
    Furthermore, the mast 124 in this embodiment is collapsible, as shown
    particularly in Figure 2. More specifically, the mast 124 is hingedly connected to
20  a base 126 of the light tower 102 at a hinge 128 so that the mast is pivotally
    movable about the hinge 128. Collapsing the mast 124 can allow for ease of
    manoeuvrability of the mast 124 when transported. The light tower 102 can be
    configured with a hydraulic system to move the mast 124 between a collapsed
    position (see Figure 2) and an upright position (see Figure 3A). The hydraulic
25  system may for example include a hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly 132
    connecting the base 126 and a lower portion of the mast 124. When the
    assembly 132 extends, the mast 124 is moved to the collapsed position; when
    the assembly 132 retracts, the mast 124 is moved to the upright position.
    Furthermore, to assist in transportability the base 126 of the light tower 102 is
30  mounted on wheels 130.
    The light tower 102 in this embodiment also has a user-interface 134 located on
    10175846_1(GHMaters) P105929.AU.1

                                           - 12
    the base 126. The user-interface 134 provides user controls to select various
    operations of the light tower 102, such as telescopic extension or retraction of
    the mast 124 to change the height of the light tower, or moving the mast 124
    between the collapsed and upright position, or changing position of the light
  5 sources 112.
    An overall width of the light tower 102 may be between 2-4 metres, for example
    3.2 metres. Preferably, the light tower 102 ought to be designed with a central
    centre of gravity to provide a stable and robust base 126.
10
    In this embodiment, the battery 110 is enclosed in the base 126 of the light
    tower 102. According to an example, the battery 110 of the light tower 102 is a
    120kWh battery. Preferably, the battery 110 is capable of "fast" charge, for
    example the battery 110 can be substantially charged in approximately 15
is  minutes. Further, the battery 110 may have an estimated run-time of 48 hours,
    which can offer approximately 4 days of 12-hour continuous operation.
    According to a specific embodiment, the battery 110 is a modular battery that is
    removably mounted in the base 126 of the light tower 102. Thus, once
20  removed, the battery 110 can be used in other equipment, such as dewatering
    pumps, generators or welders. As shown in the exploded view in Figure 3A, the
    base 126 of the light tower 102 can hold a plurality of removably in the base
    and connectable to electrical components of the light tower 102 to provide
    power to the LEDs 112.

    With reference to Figure 4, the system 400 according to another embodiment
    will be described. Features in the system 400 that are the same as
    corresponding feature in the system 100 are given the same reference numeral.
30  Like the system 100, the system 400 comprises a light tower 112, a charging
    service vehicle in the form of a truck 108 capable of carrying an energy storage
    unit in the form of a battery, and a charging station (not shown). However, in the
    10175846_1(GHMaters) P105929.AU.1

                                            - 13
    system 400, instead of the battery 104 recharging the battery 110 from the
    truck, the battery 104a is interchangeable with the battery 11 0a from the light
    tower 112. In other words, the system 400 is arranged to deliver charge from
    the charging station to the light tower 102 by the truck 108 delivering a fully
  5 charged battery 104a and swapping the battery 11 0a with the battery 104a. The
    battery 11 0a is thus removed from the light tower 102 once spent and replaced
    with another battery 104a delivered by the truck 108. It will be appreciated that
    in this embodiment the batteries 11 0a and 104a are substantially similar at least
    in function.
10
    With reference to Figure 5, the system 500 according to yet another
    embodiment will be described. Like the systems 100 and 400, the system 500
    comprises a light tower (not shown), a truck 108 capable of a battery and a
    charging station 106a. However, in the system 500, instead of the battery 11 Ob
is  remaining on the truck 108 while recharged at the charging station 106a via
    electrical cable 122, the battery 11 Ob is swapped with a further battery 140 that
    has previously been charged. The further battery 140 is substantially the same
    as the battery 11 Ob. Thus, the battery 11 Ob is removed from the truck 108, and
    the further battery 140 is mounted on the truck 108. It will be appreciated that
20  the batteries 11 Ob and 140 in this embodiment are substantially similar at least
    in function. The truck 108 can then deliver the further battery 140 to a light
    tower or other equipment that requires power from the battery 140.
    A method 600 of using the system 100 according to an embodiment will now be
25  described with reference to Figure 6. The method 600 comprises charging the
    first energy storage unit or battery 104 of the charging service vehicle or truck
    108 with power from a power source at the charging station 106 (step 602).
    Then, the truck 108 carrying the battery 104 is driven to a location where the
    battery 104 can deliver power to the second energy storage unit or battery 110
30  of the light tower 102 (step 604). Specifically, the battery 104 is coupled to the
    battery 110 (step 606). The coupling can be done using an electrical cable 116.
    Then, the battery 110 is recharged by transferring power from the battery 104 to
    10175846_1(GHMaters) P105929.AU.1

                                            - 14
    the battery 110 (step 608). While the battery 110 of the light tower 102 is being
    recharged, the light tower 102 can be inspected by personnel, e.g. a driver of
    the truck 108. Accordingly, inspection of the light tower 102 can be scheduled
    or occur when the battery 110 is being recharged or replaced. Optionally, the
  5 truck 108 can then be driven to another location to deliver power to other
    equipment or back to the charging station 106 to recharge its battery 110 (step
    610).
    A method 700 of using the system 400 according to another embodiment will
io  now be described. The method 700 comprises charging the first energy storage
    unit or battery 104 with power from a power source at the charging station 106
    (step 702). Then, the charging service vehicle carrying the battery 104 is driven
    to the light tower 102, which has the second energy storage unit installed
    therein (step 704). Then, the second energy unit or battery 110 is exchanged
is  with the battery 104 such that the battery 104 can deliver power to a light
    source of the light tower (step 706). Optionally, the method further involves
    driving the charging service vehicle 108 to another location, i.e. to deliver power
    to other equipment, or back to the charging station 106, e.g. to recharge its
    battery 110 (step 708).

    It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the invention that many
    modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the
    invention.
25  For example, alternative embodiments of the system may comprise a plurality
    of light towers to be services by the same service truck and/or a plurality of
    trucks and/or a plurality of charging docks.
    Furthermore, the charging service vehicle may be embodied in forms other than
30  a truck, such as a car towing a trailer or other carriage holding an energy
    storage unit.

   As another alternative, instead of the batteries being rechargeable by delivering
   power from a power source via an electrical cable to the battery, the batteries
   may be configured to be rechargeable by wireless or inductive charging. Thus,
   according to a specific embodiment, the step 606 of coupling the battery 104 to
 5 the battery 110 can involve electromagnetically coupling the batteries 104 and
   110 for inductive charging.
