ABSTRACT
                A method of manufacturing a tampon comprises the steps of at least
partially overlaying a web of base material with a web of absorbent material. The web of
absorbent material is secured to the web of base material with a first securement. At least
one of the web of base material and the web of absorbent material is folded after the first
securement. The web of absorbent material is further secured to the web of base material
with a second securement that is a stronger securement than the first securement. The
web of absorbent material and the web of base material together define a web of cover
material. The web of cover material is applied to an absorbent structure. The web of
cover material and the absorbent structure is manipulated such that the web of cover
material extends about a circumference of the absorbent structure to form a tampon.

                         TAMPON METHOD OF MANUFACTURE
BACKGROUND
         [0001]    Currently, there are two basic types of tampons used for feminine
hygiene. The first type is a digitally insertable tampon which is designed to be inserted
directly by the user's fingers. The second type is an applicator style tampon which is
designed to be inserted with the aid of an applicator. Both types are usually made by
folding or rolling rectangular strips of absorbent material into a blank and then
compressing the blank into a cylindrically-shaped pledget. The pledget may or may not
have a cover. In both types, a withdrawal string can be attached to the pledget. The
combination of a pledget and a withdrawal string is considered a useable tampon product.
The tampon can then be wrapped and packaged for sale. In the applicator style tampon,
the tampons can be assembled into an applicator prior to being wrapped and packaged.
         [0002]    Tampons work by acquiring vaginal fluids, including menses, at the
interface between the tampon and vaginal wall. To ensure this contact, current tampons
alter the vagina immediately upon insertion. This alteration contributes to early premature,
"by-pass" leakage. After the tampon absorbs the vaginal fluids, including menses, most
tampons begin to expand uniformly and globally, further contributing to this leakage. At
the same time, the tampon begins to become more flexible and conformable to allow for a
better global/macro fit to the vagina. This predetermined and uniform tampon response
that drives this global/macro expansion is governed by the tampon construction and
materials.
         [0003]    Even when fluid is acquired locally and the deformational forces on the
tampon by the vaginal environment are applied locally, with current tampons the
construction or materials of the tampons inhibits or constrains their capacity to expand or
adapt to give a local/micro fit. These constructions and materials force the entire tampon
to respond to these local fluid acquisition and deformational forces through material
connectivity or material stiffness.
         [0004]    When attempts are made to allow for more local adaptation in tampon
constructions, the constructions do not acquire the fluids well because of inadequate
contact area because they cannot match the local contours of the vaginal wall or are not
conformable enough to adapt to the women's individual local contours (e.g. folds and
convolutions) found on the vaginal wall. In addition, these attempts create integrity issues
with the tampons that lead to portions of the tampon remaining within the vagina after

                                                 2

tampon removal. This inadequate contact is especially true during the wiping action of the
vagina by the tampon when the tampon is inserted and removed.
         [0005]    Current tampon construction processes construct these inadequate
tampons that have this predetermined and uniform tampon response. They create these
constraints, inadequate contact area, and integrity issues in order to drive this
predetermined and uniform tampon response and, therefore, limit the tampon from
effectively responding locally. New construction processes are needed to construct
tampons that overcome the inadequacy of current tampons.
         [0006]    There remains a need for a tampon that responds locally to meet the
individual protection needs of women and processes to make such tampons. There
remains a need for a tampon that prevents leakage of body fluid after being inserted into a
woman's vagina. There remains a need for a tampon that provides efficient utilization of
the entire tampon structure during use. There remains a need for a tampon that provides
a customized fit to the anatomy of a woman's vaginal cavity. There remains a need for a
tampon that can deform and come into contact with the folds and convolutions of the walls
of the vaginal cavity and acquire any contacted fluid.
         [0007]    One potential solution to these needs is to provide a tampon having a
plurality of relatively small, discrete contact elements that are adapted to contact the folds
and convolutions of the walls of the vaginal cavity and thereby reduce the potential for
leakage of body fluid (e.g., menses) past the tampon. Although incorporating the plurality
of discrete contact elements into a tampon will potentially reduce tampon leakage, the
process to incorporate them into a usable tampon presents many significant challenges.
         [0008]    One of these challenges is meeting the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) guidelines for a Class 2 medical device. These guidelines are in place to prevent
defective tampons from causing adverse reaction with a consumer which includes, for
example, increased risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) and vaginal infections. Three of
these FDA guidelines relate to absorbency, fiber shedding (residual fiber retention) and
tampon integrity. The presence of these discrete contact elements on the tampon can
impact the tampon performance in respect to each and every one of these guidelines. To
minimize the potential of the discrete contact elements negatively impacting tampon
performance, steps have to be taken during manufacturing to prevent tampon process
damage. Tampon process damage can potentially alter the performance of the tampon

from it design requirements and includes, for example, lost contact elements, incorrectly
formed or otherwise damaged contact elements, and weakened contact elements.
         [0009]   As used herein, tampon process damage is any alteration to the tampon
that is caused by the process to create a damaged tampon. This damage can include
missed or inappropriate placed contact elements and surface process damage. When this
damage causes the tampon to be outside the FDA guidelines, the tampon is a said to be a
defective tampon. Surface process damage is any alteration to a surface that is caused
by the process to create a damaged surface. Each surface of the tampon is designed to
have certain design characteristics. When any of these design characteristics vary
significantly from target values, the surface is said to be a damage surface. These design
characteristics includes surface size, shape, configuration, and absorbency and
mechanical characteristics or properties.
         [0010]   Examples include missing and malformed surface and deteriorated
absorbency or mechanical properties. A malformed surface includes improperly sized,
shaped, cut, bent, and folded surface and especially malformations that alter the surface
contact area with the vaginal surfaces. A deteriorated absorbency or mechanical property
includes reduced wettability, permeability, and mechanical strength and especially
deteriorations that alter the surfaces ability to conform to vaginal surfaces and acquire,
intake, and distribute vaginal fluids.
         [0011]   The process used to manufacture the discrete contact elements of the
tampon must be able to make the contact elements consistently and reproducibly at high
speeds and ensures that only tampons without significant process and/or surface damage
are sold to consumers. Thus, there remains a need for a tampon processes capable of
consistently and reproducibly manufacturing tampons with discrete contact elements at
high speeds and without significant process and/or surface damage.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
         [0074]   The tampon of the current disclosure can be inserted above the introital
region of a woman's vagina, can intercept the fluid flow of menses, blood, and other body
fluids, and can prevent the fluid from exiting the vagina. While the pledgets and tampons
of the current disclosure are described for use as a menstrual device, it will be readily
apparent that the pledgets and tampons can also be used as any other suitable vaginal
insert, such as a pessary. Likewise, while the pledgets and tampons of the current
disclosure are generally described as being "absorbent," it will be readily apparent that the
pledgets and tampons may be coated or otherwise treated to be partially or completely
non-absorbent.
         [0075]   In an embodiment, the pledget and tampon of the current disclosure can
have a contact element. In an embodiment, the contact element can allow the pledget
and the tampon to respond locally to the changes in the vaginal environment and can

effectively acquire fluid locally to accommodate the uniqueness of a woman's vaginal
environment and her period.
         [0076]   A non-limiting embodiment of a tampon 10 of the current disclosure is
illustrated in FIG. 1. The tampon 10 can be inserted into a woman's vaginal cavity to
prevent menses from exiting the vaginal opening by contacting and absorbing the flow of
menses. The term "menses," as used herein, includes blood, tissue debris, and other
bodily fluids emitted from the vaginal opening. The tampon 10 can have a compressed,
generally cylindrical shaped pledget 12 and a withdrawal aid 14. In some embodiments,
the generally cylindrical shape of the pledget 12 can have a cross-section that can be at
least one of an oval, circle, square, rectangle, or any other cross-sectional shape known in
the art. The term "cross-section" refers herein to the plane which extends laterally through
the tampon 10, and which is orthogonal to the longitudinal axis 16 of the pledget 12, and
consequently, of the tampon 10. The tampon 10 can have an insertion end 18 and a
withdrawal end 20. The tampon 10 can have a length 22 wherein the length 22 is the
measurement of the tampon 10 along the longitudinal axis 16 originating at one end
(insertion or withdrawal) of the tampon 10 and ending at the opposite end (insertion or
withdrawal) of the tampon 10. In some embodiments, the tampon 10 can have a length 22
from about 30 mm to about 80 mm. The tampon 10 can have a width 24, which unless
otherwise stated herein, can correspond to the greatest cross-sectional dimension along
the longitudinal axis 16 of the tampon 10. In some embodiments, the tampon 10 can have
a compressed width 24 prior to usage from about 2, 5, 8, 10, 12, or 14 mm to about 20 or
30 mm. The tampon 10 may be straight or non-linear in shape, such as curved along the
longitudinal axis 16.
         [0077]   As noted above, the tampon 10 can have a pledget 12. The pledget 12
can be formed from a blank 28, such as a softwind, wherein the blank 28 can be formed
from a fleece 30. The fleece 30 can have an absorbent structure 34 which can be a single
layer of a fibrous material or can be multiple layers of fibrous material. In an embodiment,
an absorbent structure 34 can be formed of at least two layers of fibrous materials. The
absorbent structure 34 can be manufactured via processes such as, for example, a multi
bank laydown, bonding pre-formed layers together, or a combination thereof. Such
processes can produce a nonwoven ribbon 32 having an absorbent structure 34 of a
single layer or multiple layers of fibrous materials. In an embodiment, the nonwoven
ribbon 32 can be separated into individual units of fleece 30, wherein each unit of fleece
30 can have the absorbent structure 34.

         [0078]    In an embodiment in which the absorbent structure 34 is multi-layered, the
absorbent structure 34 can have at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 layers of fibrous material. In an
embodiment in which the absorbent structure 34 is multi-layered, a layer can be identical
to another layer, can be different from another layer, or can be identical to at least one
other layer and can be different from at least one other layer. In an embodiment in which
an absorbent structure 34 is multi-layered and at least one layer is different from another
layer, the layers can be different from each other by at least 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 aspects. Non
limiting examples of aspects of differences can include density, thickness, type of fibrous
material in a layer, amount of fibrous material in a layer, hydrophilic/hydrophobic
characteristics, and strength/integrity characteristics (which can include reinforcing fibrous
materials).
         [0079]    In an embodiment in which the absorbent structure 34 is multi-layered, the
absorbent structure 34 can be manufactured by bonding at least two pre-formed layers
together. In such an embodiment, the pre-formed layers can be brought into contact with
each other and bonded together by any suitable method. In such an embodiment, the
bonded layers can then be bonded to at least one additional layer. The at least one
additional layer can be pre-formed or can be a laid down fibrous material.
         [0080]    In an embodiment in which the absorbent structure 34 is multi-layered, the
absorbent structure 34 can be manufactured via a process such as a multi-bank fibrous
material laydown. In such a process, fibrous material in a first bank can be laid down to
form a first layer and fibrous material in a second bank can be laid down onto the first
layer and formed into a second layer. The second layer can then, if desired, be bonded to
the first layer. In an embodiment, fibrous material in at least one additional bank can be
laid down onto the prior layers and formed into at least one additional layer if so desired.
The additional layer(s) can be bonded to the prior formed and bonded layers. In an
embodiment, a pre-formed layer can be bonded to the formed and bonded layers.
         [0081]    FIG. 2 provides a non-limiting illustration of a nonwoven ribbon 32 which
can have a multi-layer absorbent structure 34 of at least two layers, such as layers 36 and
38. The nonwoven ribbon 32 can be manufactured via either a multi-bank fibrous material
laydown method, via bonding of pre-formed layers, or via a combination of the described
methods. It is to be understood that while the description and figures herein generally
illustrate a nonwoven ribbon 32, an absorbent structure 34 and/or a fleece 30 having two
layers, such as layers 36 and 38, a nonwoven ribbon 32, an absorbent structure 34 and/or
a fleece 30 can have more than two layers and the description herein is applicable to a

         [0082]   In an embodiment, the nonwoven ribbon 32 can have more than two
layers. In an embodiment, a layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, can be hydrophobic
or hydrophilic. In an embodiment, a layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, can be treated
with a surfactant or other material to make the layer(s) hydrophilic or to make the layer(s)
more hydrophilic. As will be described herein, in a nonwoven ribbon 32 having more than
one layer, the layers, such as layers 36 and 38, can be in communication with each other.
In an embodiment, the layers, such as layers 36 and 38, can be in communication with
each other and can be bonded to each other. The terms "bonded" or "bonding" refer
herein to the joining, adhering, connecting, attaching or the like of two elements. Two
elements will be considered bonded together when they are joined, adhered, connected,
or attached directly to one another or indirectly to one another, such as when each is
directly joined, adhered, connected or attached to intermediate elements. The bonding
can occur by any method deemed suitable including, but not limited to, adhesives, heat
bonding, vibration energy, mechanical bonding, chemical bonding, vacuum bonding,
ultrasonic bonds, thermal bonds, pressure bonds, mechanical entanglement,
hydroentanglement, microwave bonds, or any other conventional technique. The bonding
can be continuous or it can be intermittent.
         [0083]   Each layer, such as layers 36 and 38, can be constructed from fibrous
materials, such as fibrous materials 40 and 42, respectively. In an embodiment, the
fibrous materials can include absorbent fibers. The fibrous materials can include, but are
not limited to, natural and synthetic fibers such as, but not limited to, polyester, acetate,
nylon, cellulosic fibers such as wood pulp, cotton, rayon, viscose, LYOCELL@ such as
from Lenzing Company of Austria, or mixtures of these or other cellulosic fibers. Natural
fibers can include, but are not limited to, wool, cotton, flax, hemp and wood pulp. Wood
pulps can include, but are not limited to, standard softwood fluffing grade such as CR
1654 (US Alliance Pulp Mills, Coosa, Alabama). Pulp may be modified in order to
enhance the inherent characteristics of the fibers and their processability. Crimping can
be imparted to the fibers by any means deemed suitable by one of ordinary skill. Curl may
be imparted to the fibers by suitable methods such as, for example, chemical treatment or
mechanical twisting. Curl can be imparted before crosslinking or stiffening. Pulps may be
stiffened by the use of crosslinking agents such as formaldehyde or its derivatives,
glutaraldehyde, epichlorohydrin, methylated compounds such as urea or urea derivatives,

dialdehydes such as maleic anhydride, non-methylated urea derivatives, citric acid or
other polycarboxylic acids. Pulp may also be stiffened by the use of heat or caustic
treatments such as mercerization. Examples of these types of fibers include NHB416,
which is a chemically cross-linked southern softwood pulp fiber which enhances wet
modulus, available from Weyerhaeuser Corporation of Tacoma, WA. Other non-limiting
examples of useful pulps are debonded pulp (NF405) and non-debonded pulp (NB416)
also from Weyerhaeuser. HPZ3 from Buckeye Technologies, Inc. of Memphis, TN, is an
example of a fiber that has a chemical treatment that sets in a curl and twist, in addition to
imparting added dry and wet stiffness and resilience to the fiber. Another suitable pulp is
Buckeye HP2 pulp and still another is IP Supersoft from International Paper Corporation.
The fibrous materials can include any suitable blend of fibers. For example, the fibrous
materials can be formed from cellulose fibers such as cotton and rayon. The fibrous
materials can be 100 wt% cotton, 100 wt% rayon, or a blend of cotton and rayon. In some
embodiments, the cellulose fibers may be modified for super-absorbency. In an
embodiment, a layer, such as layer 36 or 38, can have substantially the same fibrous
material composition as another layer, such as layer 36 or 38. In an embodiment, a layer,
such as layer 36 or 38, can have a fibrous material composition different from another
layer, such as layer 36 or 38.
         [0084]   In an embodiment, the fibrous materials can have a staple length of from
about 5, 10, 15 or 20 mm to about 30, 40 or 50 mm. In an embodiment, the fibrous
materials can have a fiber size of from about 15 microns to about 28 microns. In an
embodiment, the fibrous materials can have a denier of from about 1 or 2 to about 6.
Denier is a unit of fineness of yarn based on a standard of 50 milligrams (mg) for 450
meters of yarn. The fibrous materials can have a circular, bi-lobal or tri-lobal cross
sectional configuration or any other configuration known to those skilled in the art. A bi
lobal configuration can have a cross-sectional profile which can look like a dog bone while
a tri-lobal configuration can have a cross-sectional profile which can look like a "Y." In an
embodiment, the fibrous materials can be bleached. In an embodiment, the fibrous
materials can have a color.
         [0085]   In an embodiment, a layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, can contain
fibrous materials such as binder fibers. In an embodiment, the binder fibers can have a
fiber component which can bond or fuse to other fibers in the layer. Binder fibers can be
natural fibers or synthetic fibers. Synthetic fibers can include, but are not limited to, those
made from polyolefins, polyamides, polyesters, rayon, acrylics, viscose, superabsorbents,

LYOCELL@ regenerated cellulose and any other suitable synthetic fiber known to those
skilled in the art. Non-limiting examples of polyolefins can include, but are not limited to,
polyethylene such as Dow Chemical's ASPUN® 6811 A linear low density polyethylene,
2553 LLDPE and 25355 and 12350 high density polyethylene. The polyethylenes can
have melt flow rates, respectively, of about 26, 40, 25, and 12. Non-limiting examples of
fiber forming polypropylenes can include, but are not limited to, Exxon Chemical
Company's ESCORENE@ PD 3445 polypropylene and Montell Chemical Company's
PF304. Another example of a fiber can be a bi-component polyethylene sheath and
polyester core known as T255 made by Trevira of Germany. Other non-limiting examples
of meltable bicomponent fibers can include, but are not limited to, fibers available from
Unitika of Japan, such as, for example, Unitika MELTY 4080, and 6080 fibers, having
either polyester sheaths or cores and polyethylene sheaths or cores. Another example
can include, but is not limited to, fibers available from Fibervisions under the designation
ETC Bounce fiber line, such as PET/PE fibers of about 2.2 decitex and about 40 mm
staple fiber length. Non-limiting examples of rayon fibers include 1.5 denier Merge 18453
fibers from Accordis Cellulose Fibers Inc. of Axis, Alabama. The fibrous materials can be
treated by conventional compositions and/or processes to enable or enhance wettability.
         [0086]    In an embodiment, a layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, can contain
fibrous materials such as cellulosic fibers, such as cotton and rayon. In an embodiment, a
layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, can be 100% cotton, 100% rayon, or a blend of
cotton and rayon fibers. In an embodiment, a blend of cotton and rayon fibers can be a
blend of about 15% cotton and about 85% rayon; about 70% cotton and about 30% rayon;
about 60% cotton and about 40% rayon; about 25% cotton and about 75% rayon; or a
blend of about 6% cotton and about 94% rayon. The blend of cotton and rayon can be
any blend as deemed suitable. In an embodiment, additional fibers such as polyester or
other synthetic fibers can be added to the blend of cotton and rayon to add resilient
features or bondability to a layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38.
         [0087]    In an embodiment, a layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, can have a
blend of viscose and binder fibers. In an embodiment, a blend of viscose and binder fibers
can be a blend of from about 70% viscose to about 95% viscose with the remainder from
about 30% to about 5% binder fiber. In an embodiment, a blend of viscose and binder
fibers can be a blend of from about 85 - 90% viscose and the remainder from about 15
10% binder fiber. The blend of viscose and binder fibers can be any blend as deemed
suitable.

         [0088]    Various methods known to those skilled in the art can be used to prepare
each layer, such as layers 36 and 38. Such methods can include, but are not limited to,
airlaying, carding, wetlaying, needlepunching, mechanical entanglement, hydroentangling,
and any other known method deemed suitable by one of ordinary skill. In an embodiment,
a bonded carded web can be made from staple fibers. In such an embodiment, the fibers
can be longer than about 20, 30 or 35 mm. The fibers can be purchased in bales which
can be placed in a picker to separate the fibers. The fibers can then be sent through a
combing or carding unit, which can further break apart and align the staple fibers in the
machine direction to form a generally machine direction-oriented fibrous nonwoven web.
Once the web is formed, it can then be bonded by one or more of several known bonding
methods, such as through air bonding or pattern bonding. In an embodiment, a dry laid
web can be made from staple fibers. In such an embodiment, the fibers can be about 20
mm or longer. In dry laying, fibers or tufts of fibers of a first type (e.g., absorbent fibers
and/or binder fibers) can be fed to a first rotating vacuum drum and fibers or tufts of fibers
of a second type (e.g., absorbent fibers and/or binder fibers) can be fed to a second
rotating vacuum drum. The fibers can then be laid down by suction to form mats of fibers.
The mats of fibers can be doffed from the vacuum drums and combed via rotating
lickerins. The lickerins can have peripheral teeth which can comb the fibers from the mat.
The combed fibers can be doffed from the lickerins via centrifugal force and placed into a
fiber mixing and expansion chamber. The mixed fibers can be placed on a vacuum
screen to form a random fiber web comprising the first and second fiber types. The flow
and velocity of each independent fiber stream can be controlled to provide the desired
quantity of each fiber type. It is to be understood that a layer, such as layer 36 or 38, can
be prepared using the same method as another layer, such as layer 36 or 38, or using a
method different than another layer, 36 or 38.
         [0089]    In an embodiment, at least one of the layers, such as layers 36 and/or 38,
can be prepared using an airlaying process. In such an embodiment, the airlaid fibers can
contain a first fiber and a second fiber, wherein the first fiber can be a binder fiber and the
second fiber can be an absorbent fiber.
         [0090]    In an embodiment in which binder fibers are present, the binder fibers can
be activated to create a three-dimensional fiber matrix. In such an embodiment, the
activation can be completed by any suitable heating step including, but not limited to,
convection heating, through air heating, superheated steam, microwave heating, radiant
heating, radio frequency heating, and the like, and combinations thereof. In some

                                               15

embodiments, the activation can be accomplished by heating the layer(s), such as layer(s)
36 and/or 38, containing the binder fibers at a temperature of from about 240'F to about
428'F (about 1150C to about 2200C) to activate the binder fibers. It is to be understood
that the bonding temperature selected should be selected based upon the fibrous
materials which are being bonded together. Without being bound by theory, it is believed
that during activation, the binder fibers can soften and become tacky and, therefore, bind
to adjacent fibers creating a three-dimensional fiber matrix. It is believed that the three
dimensional fiber matrix can stabilize the layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, and can
create a liquid stable network. It is to be understood that an additional component or finish
can be added to the fibers to facilitate bonding of fibrous materials which are not
necessarily compatible.
         [0091]   In an embodiment, the activation can be followed by a cooling step which
can utilize any suitable means for reducing the temperature of the layer(s), such as
layer(s) 36 and/or 38. In an embodiment, the layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, can
be cooled by allowing the layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, to return to ambient
temperature over a period of time. In an embodiment, the layer(s), such as layer(s) 36
and/or 38, can be cooled by chill rolls, cooling chambers, blowing conditioned air, or the
like, and combinations thereof. In an embodiment, the cooling step can occur prior to
compression of the layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, to establish a wet-stable three
dimensional structure.
         [0092]   In some embodiments, a layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, can be
further manipulated such as, for example, being folded, corrugated, or otherwise
processed.
         [0093]   The nonwoven ribbon 32 can be separated into individual units of fleece
30. The separation of the nonwoven ribbon 32 into individual units of fleece 30 can occur
by any suitable method such as stretching, perforating, cutting such as with the use of a
die cutter or a knife cutter, and the like. The individual units of fleece 30 can then be
rolled, stacked, folded, or otherwise manipulated into blanks 28. The blanks 28 can then
be formed into pledgets 12 in any manner deemed suitable. As a non-limiting example,
the blanks 28 can undergo compression to form the pledgets 12.
         [0094]   In various embodiments, the fleece 30 and the resultant pledget 12 can
have any suitable combination and ratio of fibrous material. In an embodiment, the fleece
30 and the resultant pledget 12 can have from about 70 to about 95 wt% absorbent fibers

and from about 5 to about 30 wt% binder fibers. In an embodiment, the fleece 30 and the
resultant pledget 12 can have from about 80 to about 90 wt% absorbent fibers and from
about 10 to about 20 wt% binder fibers. In an embodiment, the fleece 30 and the resultant
pledget 12 can have about 85 wt% absorbent fibers and about 15 wt% binder fibers. In an
embodiment, the fleece 30 and the resultant pledget 12 can have from about 80 to about
90 wt% trilobal viscose rayon fibers and from about 10 to about 20 wt% bicomponent
binder fibers. In an embodiment, the fleece 30 and the resultant pledget 12 can have
about 85 wt% trilobal viscose rayon fibers and about 15 wt% bicomponent binder fibers.
In an embodiment, the fleece 30 and the resultant pledget 12 can have greater than about
50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 80, 90, 95, 97, or 99 wt% absorbent fibers.
         [0095]   The fleece 30 can be any size and thickness that can ultimately be
compressed into a pledget 12 having a vaginally insertable shape. In an embodiment, the
size of the fleece 30 can range from about 40 mm to about 100, 200, 250 or 300 mm in
width and from about 30 mm to about 80 mm in length. As described herein, the width of
the fleece 30 can be measured as the distance between longitudinal edges of the fleece
30 and the length of the fleece 30 can be measured as the distance between transverse
edges of the fleece 30. As described herein, the transverse edges of the fleece 30 can be
located at the insertion and withdrawal ends, 18 and 20, respectively, of a resultant
tampon 10. In an embodiment, the overall basis weight of the fleece 30 can range from
about 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 90, 100, 110, 120, 135 or 150 gsm to about 1,000, 1,100, 1,200,
1,300, 1,400, or 1,500 gsm.
         [0096]   Referring to FIG. 3, a non-limiting example of a fleece 30 is illustrated in
which the fleece 30 can have a multi-layer absorbent structure 34 of two layers, 36 and
38. In the non-limiting example illustrated, the first layer 36 can have a first length 44 and
a first width 46. The first length 44 can extend from a first transverse edge 48 to a second
transverse edge 50 of the first layer 36. The first width 46 can extend from a first
longitudinal edge 52 to a second longitudinal edge 54 of the first layer 36. The first layer
36 can have a first surface 56 (illustrated in FIG. 4) and a second surface 58. Similarly,
the second layer 38 can have a second length 60 and a second width 62. The second
length 60 can extend from a first transverse edge 64 (illustrated in FIG. 4) to a second
transverse edge 66 of the second layer 38. The second width 62 can extend from a first
longitudinal edge 68 to a second longitudinal edge 70 of the second layer 38. The second
layer 38 can have a first surface 72 and a second surface 74 (illustrated in FIG. 4). In a
resultant tampon 10, the transverse edges of each layer, 36 and 38, can be located at the

insertion end 18 and the withdrawal end 20. As a non-limiting example with regards to the
fleece 30 illustrated in FIG. 3, transverse edges 50 and 66 can be located at the insertion
end 18 of a resultant tampon 10 and transverse edges 48 and 64 can be located at the
withdrawal end 20 of a resultant tampon 10.
          [0097]   The absorbent structure 34 can be constructed such that one of the
surfaces, 56 or 58, of the first layer 36 can be at least partially in a face to face relationship
with one of the surfaces, 72 or 74, of the second layer 38. In an embodiment, at least
about 25% of one of the surfaces, 72 or 74, of the second layer 38 can be in a face to face
relationship with one of the surfaces, 56 or 58, of the first layer 36. In an embodiment, at
least about 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 or 100% of one of the
surfaces, 72 or 74, of the second layer 38 can be in a face to face relationship with one of
the surfaces, 56 or 58, of the first layer 36. In an embodiment, less than 100% of one of
the surfaces, 72 or 74, of the second layer 38 can be in a face to face relationship with
one of the surfaces, 56 or 58, of the first layer 36. In an embodiment, from about 25, 30,
35, 40, 45, or 50% to about 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 or 100% of one of the
surfaces, 72 or 74, of the second layer 38 can be in a face to face relationship with one of
the surfaces, 56 or 58, of the first layer 36.
          [0098]   In the exemplary illustration of FIG. 3, the first and second layers, 36 and
38, are illustrated as being substantially coextensive with each other. In such an
embodiment, the first length 44 of the first layer 36 can be substantially the same as the
second length 60 of the second layer 38. The first width 46 of the first layer 36 can be
substantially the same as the second width 62 of the second layer 38. In the exemplary
illustration of FIG. 3, about 100% of the first surface 56 of the first layer 36 can be in a face
to face relationship with the second surface 74 of the second layer 38. As described
herein, a withdrawal aid 14 and a cover 138 can be associated with the fleece 30.
          [0099]   In an embodiment, the fleece 30 can have a multi-layer absorbent
structure 34 in which one of the layers, 36 or 38, can have a length and/or width different
from the other layer, 36 or 38. Referring to FIGs. 4 - 8, non-limiting examples of

         [0107]    As described herein, each layer, such as layers 36 and 38, can have
transverse edges, such as transverse edges 48 and 50 of layer 36 and transverse edges
64 and 66 of layer 38. In an embodiment, each transverse edge(s), 48, 50, 64 and/or 66,
can be linear, non-linear, arcuate, and any combination thereof as deemed suitable. Such
an edge can be produced in any manner as deemed suitable, such as, but not limited to,
knife cutting, die cutting, or any other method known to one skilled in the art. As described
herein, a transverse edge can be located at the insertion end 18, the withdrawal end 20 or
a location between the insertion and withdrawal ends, 18 and 20, of a resultant tampon
10.
         [0108]    In an embodiment, at least one layer, such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, of the
absorbent structure 34 can have at least one contact element 88. Without being bound by
theory, it is believed that when the tampon 10 is in use the contact element 88 can at least
partially expand outwardly from the tampon 10 when contacted by bodily fluids. It is
believed that such expansion of the contact element 88 can reduce or prevent leakage of
bodily fluids from the woman's vagina.
         [0109]    In an embodiment, a tampon 10 can have at least one contact element 88
located at the insertion end 18 of the tampon 10. In an embodiment, a tampon 10 can
have at least one contact element 88 located at the withdrawal end 20 of the tampon. In
an embodiment, a tampon 10 can have at least one contact element 88 located at both the
insertion end 18 and the withdrawal end 20 of the tampon 10. In an embodiment, a
tampon 10 can have at least one contact element 88 at a location of the tampon 10
between the insertion end 18 and the withdrawal end 20. In an embodiment, a tampon 10
can have at least one contact element 88 at a location of the tampon 10 between the
insertion end 18 and the withdrawal end 20 and at least one contact element 88 located at
at least one of the insertion end 18 and/or the withdrawal end 20 of the tampon 10.
         [0110]    In an embodiment, a contact element 88 can at least partially expand
outwardly from the tampon 10 when contacted by body fluids. Without being bound by
theory, it is believed that, while the entire tampon 10 may expand from a compressed
configuration into a less compressed configuration when contacted by body fluids, when a
contact element 88 is contacted by body fluids and at least partially expands away from
the tampon 10 as a result of such contact, the expansion of a contact element 88 away
from the tampon 10 can result in an expanded contact element 88 region having a cross
sectional diameter that is greater than a cross-sectional diameter of the remaining
expanded tampon 10. FIG. 1 provides a non-limiting illustration of a compressed tampon

10 of the current disclosure. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the tampon 10 can have at least one
contact element 88 located at the insertion end 18 of the tampon 10. FIG. 10 provides a
non-limiting example of an activated tampon 10, i.e., an expanded tampon 10, wherein the
contact elements 88 can expand away from the tampon 10 and the region of the contact
elements 88 can have a greater cross-sectional diameter than the remainder of the
tampon 10. As a contact element 88 expands outwardly from the tampon 10, the contact
element 88 can deform and follow the folds and convolutions of the walls of the vaginal
cavity in order to respond locally to the changes in the vaginal environment.
        [0111]     A contact element 88 can have a base 92. In an embodiment, a base 92
of at least one contact element 88 can be located at the insertion end 18 of a tampon 10.
In an embodiment, a base 92 of at least one contact element 88 can be located at the
withdrawal end 20 of a tampon 10. In an embodiment, a base 92 of at least one contact
element 88 can be located at the insertion end 18 of a tampon 10 and a base 92 of at
least one contact element 88 can be located at the withdrawal end 20 of a tampon 10. In
an embodiment, a base 92 of at least one contact element 88 can be at a location
between the insertion end 18 and the withdrawal end 20 of a tampon 10. In an
embodiment, a base 92 of at least one contact element 88 can be at a location between
the insertion end 18 and the withdrawal end 20 of a tampon 10 and a base 92 of a contact
element 88 can be located at at least one of the insertion end 18 and/or the withdrawal
end 20 of a tampon 10.
        [0112]     In an embodiment, a contact element 88 can be at least partially bounded
by a free edge 94 and at least partially bounded by a base 92. In an embodiment, a
portion of a free edge 94 of a contact element 88 can at least partially align with the
insertion end 18 of a tampon 10. In an embodiment, a portion of a free edge 94 of a
contact element 88 can at least partially align with the withdrawal end 20 of a tampon 10.
In an embodiment, substantially all of the contact element 88 can be located between the
insertion end 18 and the withdrawal end 20 of a tampon 10. In an embodiment, a portion
of a free edge 94 of a contact element 88 can be at least partially aligned with the insertion

embodiment, each of the layers, such as layers 36 and 38, can each have at least one
contact element 88 located at each of the insertion end 18 and the withdrawal end 20 of a
tampon 10. In an embodiment, one of the layers, such as layer 36 or 38, can have a

thereof.
         [0118]    FIGs. 11 - 24 illustrate various non-limiting examples of embodiments of
an absorbent structure 34 in which at least one layer, such as layer 36 and/or 38, can
have at least one contact element 88. It is to be understood that the configurations of
absorbent structures 34 and contact elements 88 described and illustrated herein are non
limiting and additional configurations are contemplated by this disclosure.
         [0119]    In an embodiment, a layer(s), such as layer 36 and/or 38, of an absorbent
structure 34 can have a transverse edge which can have an undulating arcuate pattern. In
such an embodiment, the undulating arcuate pattern can produce at least one contact
element 88. The amplitude of each arc can be any amplitude as deemed suitable. In
such an embodiment, a contact element 88 can be at least partially separated from
another contact element 88 by the amplitude of the arc. FIG. 11 illustrates a non-limiting
example of an absorbent structure 34 which can have two layers, 36 and 38. As
illustrated in FIG. 11, layer 36 can have a first width 46 which can be substantially the
same as the second width 62 of layer 38. As illustrated in FIG. 11, layer 36 can have a
first length 44 which can be longer than a second length 60 of layer 38. Layer 36 can
have two transverse edges, 48 and 50, in which transverse edge 48 can have an
undulating arcuate pattern. Such an undulating arcuate pattern can produce contact
elements 88 which can be at least partially separated from each other by the amplitude of
an arc between each contact element 88. In an embodiment, a transverse edge having an

tampon 10.
         [0120]    In an embodiment, the free edge 94 of a contact element 88 can be
generated via a slit 96. A slit 96 can extend through a layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or
38, from a first surface and through to a second surface of the layer(s), such as layer(s) 36
and/or 38. For example, a slit 96 can be incorporated into layer 36, extending from a first
surface 56 of layer 36 through to a second surface 58 of layer 36 to form a free edge 94 of
a contact element 88. In an embodiment, a layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, can
have at least one slit 96. In an embodiment, a layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, can
have at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 slits 96. In an embodiment, a layer(s), such as
layer(s) 36 and/or 38, can have from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 to about 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 slits 96. In an embodiment, a layer(s), such as layer(s) 36
and/or 38, can have the appropriate number of slits 96 to provide the desired number of
contact elements 88.
         [0121]    In an embodiment, a slit 96 can be linear, arcuate, any other shape, or
combination thereof. In an embodiment, a slit 96 can have any length 98 as desired. The
length 98 can be measured as the distance between the terminal ends of the slit 96. In an
embodiment in which the slit 96 contains an arc, the arc length can be determined by any
manner deemed suitable by one of ordinary skill in order to determine the length 98 of the
slit 96. In an embodiment, the length 98 of a slit 96 can range from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 mm to about 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,

         [0127]  FIG. 12 provides a non-limiting example of an absorbent structure 34
which can have two layers, 36 and 38. The first layer 36 of the absorbent structure 34

layer 38. The first width 46 of the first layer 36 can be substantially similar to the second
width 62 of the second layer 38. The first layer 36 can have two transverse edges, 48 and
50, and the second layer 38 can have two transverse edges, 64 and 66. In the non
limiting example, transverse edge 66 of the second layer 38 can be substantially aligned
with transverse edge 50 of the first layer 36. In the non-limiting illustration of FIG. 12, first
layer 36 can have at least one slit 96 located between transverse edges 48 and 50 of layer
36. The slits 96 can extend from a first surface 56 of the first layer 36 through to a second
surface 58 of the first layer 36. The slits 96 can be in any configuration as desired, such
as, for example, an arcuate configuration. It should be realized that the slits 96 can have
any length 98 as desired and can be spaced apart from each other any distance as

mm. In an embodiment in which slits 96 are associated with a transverse edge of a layer,
such as layer 36 or 38, as described herein, the width 102 can be the width of a contact
element 88. Two successive slits 96 associated with a transverse edge can create a
contact element 88.
         [0130]   FIG. 13 - 24 illustrate various embodiments of slits 96 incorporated into at
least one layer, 36 and/or 38, of an absorbent structure 34 and associated with a
transverse edge. As shown in the non-limiting examples of FIG. 13 - 24, the slits 96 can
be incorporated into a layer(s), 36 and/or 38, such as, for example, by being cut through
from a first surface to a second surface of at least one layer, such as layer 36 and/or 38.
While particular embodiments are illustrated and described, it is to be understood that
various changes and modifications can be made to the embodiments illustrated and
described without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.
         [0131]   FIG. 13 provides a non-limiting example of an absorbent structure 34
which can have two layers, 36 and 38. The first layer 36 of the absorbent structure 34 can
have a first length 44 which can be greater than the second length 60 of the second layer
38. The first width 46 of the first layer 36 can be substantially similar to the second width
62 of the second layer 38. The first layer 36 can have two transverse edges, 48 and 50,
and the second layer 38 can have two transverse edges, 64 and 66. In the non-limiting

example, transverse edge 66 of the second layer 38 can be substantially aligned with
transverse edge 50 of the first layer 36. In the non-limiting illustration of FIG. 13, first layer
36 can have at least one slit 96 associated with transverse edge 48. The first layer 36 can
have at least two successive slits 96 associated with transverse edge 48 and the two
successive slits 96 can create a contact element 88. The slits 96 can extend from a first
surface 56 of the first layer 36 through to a second surface 58 of the first layer 36. The
slits 96 can extend from the transverse edge 48 in a direction away from the transverse
edge 48 and towards an interior region of the first layer 36 of the absorbent structure 34
such that the slits 96 can extend in a direction toward the opposite transverse edge 50 of
the first layer 36. It should be realized that the slits 96 can have any length 98 as desired
as the slits 96 extend from transverse edge 48 in a direction towards the opposite
transverse edge 50 of the first layer 36. As illustrated in FIG. 13 in a non-limiting
embodiment, at least one of the slits 96 can have a first slit length 104 and at least one of
the slits 96 can have a second slit length 106 wherein the first slit length 104 and the
second slit length 106 are not the same. As illustrated in FIG. 13 in the non-limiting
embodiment illustrated, the slits 96 may be incorporated into layer 36 in a pattern of
alternating lengths. In an embodiment in which slits 96 having different lengths are
incorporated into a layer, such as layer 36 and/or 38, the slits 96 having different lengths
can be incorporated into the respective layer such that the different lengths of the slits 96
can be in a random sequence, in an alternating pattern, or in a repeating pattern. As
illustrated in FIG. 13, the slits 96 do not necessarily extend the entire first length 44 of the
first layer 36. While the second layer 38 is illustrated such that transverse edge 66 can be
substantially aligned with transverse edge 50 of the first layer 36, it should be realized that
transverse edge 66 of second layer 38 does not need to be substantially aligned with
transverse edge 50 of the first layer 36. It should be realized that second layer 38 can be
bonded to the first layer 36 at any position along the first length 44 of the first layer 36 as
deemed suitable. It should be realized that transverse edge 64 of second layer 38 can
also be positioned anywhere along the first length 44 of the first layer 36 as desired and
the second length 60 of second layer 38 can be any dimension as desired. In an
embodiment, layer 38 can at least partially or completely overlay the contact elements 88
incorporated into layer 36. As described herein, transverse edge 48 can be located at the
insertion end 18 or the withdrawal end 20 of a resultant tampon 10. In an embodiment,
the contact elements 88 of the absorbent structure 34 illustrated in FIG. 13 can be located
at the insertion end 18 or the withdrawal end 20 of a resultant tampon 10. In the non
limiting embodiment illustrated in FIG. 13, the contact elements 88 can be oriented

embodiment, a slit 96 can also be incorporated into second layer 38.
         [0132]     FIG. 14 provides an illustration of a non-limiting example of an
embodiment of an absorbent structure 34 in which the first layer 36 can have a first length
44 greater than the second length 60 of the second layer 38. As illustrated in FIG. 14, the
first width 46 of the first layer 36 can be substantially similar to the second width 62 of the
second layer 38. In the non-limiting example illustrated in FIG. 14, the second layer 38
can be bonded to the first layer 36 in the central region of the first length 44 of the first
layer 36. The central region of the first length 44 can be the area adjacent a center line 84
of the first length 44 of the first layer 36 of the absorbent structure 34. It is to be
understood that the central region of the first length 44 does not need to be the exact
center of the first layer 36, but can be located generally around the center line 84 of the
first length 44. In an embodiment, the central region of the first layer 36 can be a position
along the first length 44 which can be a distance 86 that can be about 0.35 to about 0.65
times the first length 44, as measured from either transverse edge, 48 or 50, of the first
layer 36. In an embodiment, the second layer 38 does not have to be bonded to the first
layer 36 in the central region of the first length 44, but rather could be bonded to the first
layer 36 in an area adjacent to one of the transverse edges, 48 or 50, or at any other
position along the first length 44 of the first layer 36 as deemed suitable. In the non
limiting illustration of FIG. 14, the first layer 36 can have at least one slit 96 associated
with each of the transverse edges, 48 and 50, of first layer 36. The first layer 36 can have
at least two successive slits 96 associated with transverse edges 48 and 50, respectively,
and the two successive slits 96 associated with a transverse edge can create a contact
element 88. The slits 96 can extend from a first surface 56 of the first layer 36 through to
a second surface 58 of the first layer 36. The slits 96 can extend from the transverse
edge, 48 or 50, respectively, in a direction towards an interior region of the first layer 36 of
the absorbent structure 34 such that the slits 96 can extend from the associated
transverse edge, 48 or 50, and in a direction toward the opposite transverse edge, 48 or
50, respectively, of the first layer 36. It should be realized that the slits 96 can have any
length 98 as desired as the slits 96 extend from a transverse edge, 48 or 50, in a direction
towards the opposite transverse edge, 48 or 50, of the first layer 36. As illustrated in FIG.
14 in a non-limiting embodiment, at least one of the slits 96 can have a first slit length 104
and at least one of the slits 96 can have a second slit length 106 wherein the first slit
length 104 and the second slit length 106 are not the same. As illustrated in FIG. 14 in a
non-limiting embodiment, the slits 96 may be incorporated into layer 36 in a pattern of

alternating lengths. In an embodiment in which slits 96 having different lengths are
incorporated into a layer, such as layer 36 and/or 38, the slits 96 having different lengths
can be incorporated into the respective layer such that the different lengths of the slits 96
can be in a random sequence, in an alternating pattern, or in a repeating pattern. As
illustrated in FIG. 14, the slits 96 do not necessarily extend the entire first length 44 of the
first layer 36. It should be realized that transverse edges, 64 and 66, of second layer 38
can be positioned anywhere along the first length 44 of the first layer 36 as desired and
the second length 60 of second layer 38 can be any dimension as desired. In an
embodiment, layer 38 can at least partially or completely overlay the contact elements 88
incorporated into layer 36. As described herein, the transverse edges, 48 and 50, can be
located at the insertion end 18 and the withdrawal end 20 of a resultant tampon 10. Thus,
in an embodiment, the contact elements 88 of the absorbent structure 34 illustrated in FIG.
 14 can be located at the insertion end 18 and the withdrawal end 20 of a resultant tampon
 10. In the non-limiting embodiment illustrated in FIG. 14, the contact elements 88 can be
oriented towards the insertion end 18 and the withdrawal end 20 of a resultant tampon 10.
In an embodiment, a slit 96 can also be incorporated into second layer 38.
         [0133]    FIG. 15 provides an illustration of a non-limiting example of an
embodiment of an absorbent structure 34 in which the first layer 36 can have a first width
46 greater than the second width 62 of the second layer 38. As illustrated in FIG. 15, the
first length 44 of the first layer 36 can be substantially similar to the second length 60 of
the second layer 38. In the non-limiting example illustrated in FIG. 15, the second layer 38
can be bonded to the central region of the first width 46 of the first layer 36. The central
region of the first width 46 can be the area adjacent a center line 78 of the first width 46 of
the first layer 36 of the absorbent structure 34. It is to be understood that the central
region of the first width 46 does not need to be the exact center of the first layer 36, but
can be located generally around the center line 78 of the first width 46. In an embodiment,
the central region of the first width 46 of the first layer 36 can be a position along the first
width 46 which can be a distance 80 that can be about 0.35 to about 0.65 times the first
width 46, as measured from either longitudinal edge, 52 or 54, of the first layer 36. In an
embodiment, the second layer 38 does not have to be bonded to the first layer 36 in the
central region of the first width 46, but rather could be bonded to the first layer 36 in an
area adjacent to one of the longitudinal edges, 52 or 54, or at any other position along the
first width 46 of the first layer 36 as deemed suitable. In the non-limiting embodiment of
FIG. 15, first layer 36 can have at least one slit 96 associated with transverse edge 48 and
second layer 38 can have at least one slit 96 associated with transverse edge 64. Each

layer, 36 and 38, can have at least two successive slits 96 associated with their respective
transverse edges, 48 and 64, and the two successive slits 96 can create a contact
element 88 in each layer, 36 and 38. With regards to the at least one slit 96 associated
with the transverse edge 48 of the first layer 36, the slit 96 can extend from a first surface
56 of the first layer 36 through to a second surface 58 of the first layer 36. The slit 96
associated with transverse edge 48 can extend from the transverse edge 48 in a direction
towards an interior region of the first layer 36 of the absorbent structure 34 such that the
slit 96 can extend in a direction towards the opposite transverse edge 50 of the first layer
36. With regards to the at least one slit 96 associated with the transverse edge 64 of the
second layer 38, the slit 96 can extend from a first surface 72 through to a second surface
74 of the second layer 38. The slit 96 associated with transverse edge 64 can extend
from the transverse edge 64 in a direction towards an interior region of the second layer
38 of the absorbent structure 34 such that the slit 96 can extend from the transverse edge
64 in a direction towards the opposite transverse edge 66 of the second layer 38. While
the slits 96 of the first layer 36 and the slits 96 of the second layer 38 are illustrated in a
manner in which the slits 96 of the second layer 38 can be positioned to substantially align
with the slits 96 of the first layer 36, it should be realized that the slits 96 of the second
layer 38 can be offset from the slits 96 of the first layer 36. An offset of the slits 96 of the
second layer 38 from the slits 96 of the first layer 36 can be in any amount as deemed
suitable. It should be realized that the slits 96 of each of the layers, 36 and 38, can have
any length 98 as desired as the slits 96 extend from a transverse edge, 48 or 64, in a
direction towards the opposite transverse edge, 50 or 66, of the first layer 36 or second
layer 38, respectively. As illustrated in FIG. 15 in a non-limiting embodiment, at least one
of the slits 96 of layer 36 and/or 38 can have a first slit length 104 and at least one of the
slits 96 of the same layer, 36 and/or 38, can have a second slit length 106 wherein the first
slit length 104 and the second slit length 106 are not the same. As illustrated in FIG. 15 in
a non-limiting embodiment, the slits 96 may be incorporated into layer 36 and layer 38 in a
pattern of alternating lengths. In an embodiment in which slits 96 having different lengths
are incorporated into a layer, such as layer 36 and/or 38, the slits 96 having different
lengths can be incorporated into the respective layer such that the different lengths of the
slits 96 can be in a random sequence, in an alternating pattern, or in a repeating pattern.
As illustrated in FIG. 15, the slits 96 do not necessarily extend the entire length, 44 or 60,
of the first layer 36 or the second layer 38, respectively. As described herein, the
transverse edges, 48, 50, 64, and 66, can be located at the insertion end 18 or the
withdrawal end 20 of a resultant tampon 10. Thus, in an embodiment, the contact

embodiment illustrated in FIG. 15, the contact elements 88 of layers 36 and 38 can be
oriented towards the insertion end 18 or the withdrawal end 20 of a resultant tampon 10.
In an embodiment, at least one of the layers, 36 and/or 38, can also have at least one slit
96 associated with the opposite transverse edge, 50 and/or 66, respectively. It should be
realized that in the non-limiting embodiment illustrated in FIG. 15, the contact elements 88
of the first layer 36 and the contact elements 88 of the second layer 38 need not be
bonded to each other. Thus, it should be realized that the two layers, 36 and 38, do not
need to be bonded to each other in any region wherein a contact element 88 is present.
         [0134]    FIG. 16 provides an illustration of a non-limiting example of an
embodiment of an absorbent structure 34 in which the first layer 36 can have a first length
44 and a first width 46 that can each be greater than the second length 60 and the second
width 62 of the second layer 38. In the non-limiting illustration of FIG. 16, first layer 36 can
have at least one slit 96 associated with a transverse edge such as transverse edge 48.
The first layer 36 can have at least two successive slits 96 associated with transverse
edge 48 and the two successive slits 96 can create a contact element 88. The slits 96 can
extend from a first surface 56 of the first layer 36 through to a second surface 58 of the
first layer 36. The slits 96 can extend from the transverse edge 48 in a direction away
from the transverse edge 48 and towards an interior region of the first layer 36 of the
absorbent structure 34 such that the slits 96 can extend in a direction toward the opposite
transverse edge 50 of the first layer 36. It should be realized that the slits 96 can have
any length 98 as desired as the slits 96 extend from transverse edge 48 in a direction
towards the opposite transverse edge 50 of the first layer 36. As illustrated in FIG. 16 in a
non-limiting embodiment, each slit 96 can have a length 98 substantially similar to the
length 98 of each other slit 96 present. In an embodiment, the slits 96 can have varying
lengths 98. As illustrated in FIG. 16, the slits 96 do not necessarily extend the entire first
length 44 of the first layer 36. In an embodiment, the slits 96 can extend a length 98 that
is substantially similar to, less than or greater than a distance 118 between transverse
edge 48 and transverse edge 64. It should be realized that second layer 38 can be
bonded to the first layer 36 at any position along the first length 44 and/or first width 46 of
the first layer 36 as deemed suitable and can have any size dimension as deemed
suitable. It should be realized that the two layers, 36 and 38, do not need to be bonded to

structure 34 illustrated in FIG. 16 can be located at the insertion end 18 or the withdrawal
end 20 of a resultant tampon 10. In the non-limiting embodiment illustrated in FIG. 16, the

         [0135]     FIG. 17 provides an illustration of a non-limiting example of an
embodiment of an absorbent structure 34 which can have two layers, 36 and 38. As
illustrated, first layer 36 can have a first width 46 that can be substantially similar to a
second width 62 of the second layer 38. As illustrated, first layer 36 can have at least one
fold 110 incorporated therein. In such an embodiment in which a fold 110 is present, the
first layer 36 can be bent upon itself such that a first portion of at least one of the surfaces,
56 or 58, can be in communication with a second portion of the same surface, 56 or 58.
As a non-limiting example, as illustrated in FIG. 17, the first layer 36 can contain a single
fold 110 bringing a first portion 112 of the first surface 56 into communication with a
second portion 114 of the first surface 56. In the non-limiting embodiment illustrated in
FIG. 17, the fold 110 can bring transverse edge 48 of first layer 36 into communication
with transverse edge 64 of the second layer 38. It should be realized that layer 36 can
have a first length 44 greater than a second length 60 of layer 38 and fold 110 can occur
at any desired location along the first length 44 of layer 36. In an embodiment, a fold 110
can bring transverse edge 48 of layer 36 into communication with transverse edge 64 of
layer 38, into communication with a portion of second layer 38 located between transverse
edges 64 and 66, into communication with transverse edge 66 of second layer 38, into a
configuration wherein transverse edge 48 can extend beyond transverse edge 66, or to a
location of first layer 36 such that transverse edge 48 is not in communication with the
second layer 38. As illustrated, first layer 36 can have at least one slit 96 which can be cut
through from a second surface 58, through the first and second portions, 112 and 114, of
the first surface 56, and to the opposite second surface 58 of the first layer 36. The first
layer 36 can have at least two successive slits 96 and the two successive slits 96 can
create a contact element 88. As illustrated, the slit(s) 96 can be associated with the fold
110 of the first layer 36. The slit(s) 96 can extend from the fold 110 of the first layer 36 in
a direction away from the fold 110 and towards the interior region of the absorbent

38. In an embodiment, at least one of the layers, 36 and/or 38, can have at least one slit
96 associated with the transverse edges, 48, 50, 64 and/or 66, respectively. As described
herein, the fold 110 can be located at the insertion end 18 or the withdrawal end 20 of a
resultant tampon 10. Thus, in an embodiment, the contact elements 88 of the absorbent
structure 34 illustrated in FIG. 17 can be located at the insertion end 18 or the withdrawal

         [0136]     FIG. 18 provides an illustration of a non-limiting example of an
embodiment of an absorbent structure 34 which can have two layers 36 and 38. As
illustrated, the first layer 36 can have two transverse edges, 48 and 50, and the second
layer 38 can have two transverse edges, 64 and 66. In an embodiment, the first layer 36
can have more than one fold, such as folds 110 and 122, incorporated therein. In such an
embodiment, the first fold 110 can bring transverse edge 48 of first layer 36 into
communication with transverse edge 64 of the second layer 38. In an embodiment, fold
110 can bring transverse edge 48 of layer 36 into communication with transverse edge 64
of layer 38, into communication with a portion of layer 38 located between transverse
edges 64 and 66, into communication with transverse edge 66 of layer 38, into a
configuration wherein transverse edge 48 can extend beyond transverse edge 66, or to a
location of layer 36 such that transverse edge 48 is not in communication with layer 38. In
such an embodiment, a first portion 112 of first surface 56 of the first layer 36 can be
brought into a face-to-face relationship with a second portion 114 of first surface 56 of the
first layer 36. In an embodiment, the fold 110 can be utilized to bring the two portions, 112
and 114, into a facing relationship and, in some embodiments, a space 120 can exist
between the two portions, 112 and 114, while they are in a facing relationship. In an
embodiment, such as illustrated in the non-limiting embodiment of FIG. 18, a second fold
122 can be incorporated into layer 36. In the non-limiting illustration, the second fold 122
can be incorporated into layer 36 at any location of the first layer 36 such as, for example,
at a location between the transverse edge 48 and the first fold 110. The second fold 122
can be configured such that the second fold 122 can position a portion of the first layer 36
into the space 120 created by the first fold 110. The second fold 122 can bring a first
portion 124 of the second surface 58 into a facing relationship with a second portion 126

the folds 110 and 122 can be located at the insertion end 18 or the withdrawal end 20 of a
resultant tampon 10. Thus, in an embodiment, the contact elements 88 of the absorbent
structure 34 illustrated in FIG. 18 can be located at the insertion end 18 or the withdrawal
end 20 of a resultant tampon 10. In the non-limiting embodiment illustrated in FIG. 18, the
contact elements 88 can be oriented towards the insertion end 18 or the withdrawal end
20 of a resultant tampon 10. In an embodiment, at least one slit 96 can be incorporated
into second layer 38. In an embodiment, at least one of the layers, 36 and/or 38, can have
at least one slit 96 associated with the transverse edges, 48, 50, 64 and/or 66,
respectively.
         [0137]   FIG. 19 provides an illustration of a non-limiting embodiment of an
absorbent structure 34 which can have two layers, 36 and 38. As illustrated, the first layer
36 can have a first width 46 that can be substantially similar to a second width 62 of the
second layer 38. The first layer 36 can have a first length 44 which can be longer than a
second length 60 of the second layer 38. As illustrated, first layer 36 can have at least two
folds, 110 and 122, incorporated therein. In such an embodiment in which two folds, 110
and 122, are present, the layer 36 can be bent upon itself such that a first portion of one
surface, 56 or 58, of the layer 36 can be in a facing relationship with a second portion of
the same surface, 56 or 58, and a third portion of one surface, 56 or 58, of the layer 36
can be in a facing relationship with a first portion of the other surface, 56 or 58. As a non

a first portion 112 of the first surface 56 into a facing relationship with a second portion
114 of the first surface 56. Following the creation of the first fold 110, the transverse edge

direction away from the fold 110 and towards the second fold 122 of first layer 36. The at
least one slit 96 can be incorporated into layer 36 prior to or after layer 36 has been
folded. As described herein, the fold 110 can be located between the insertion end 18 and
the withdrawal end 20 of a resultant tampon 10. Thus, in an embodiment, the contact
elements 88 of the absorbent structure 34 illustrated in FIG. 24 can be located between
the insertion end 18 and the withdrawal end 20 of a resultant tampon 10. In the non
limiting embodiment illustrated in FIG. 24, the contact elements 88 can be oriented
towards the insertion end 18 or the withdrawal end 20 of a resultant tampon 10. In an
embodiment, at least one slit 96 can be incorporated into second layer 38. In an
embodiment, at least one of the layers, 36 and/or 38, can have at least one slit 96
associated with the transverse edges, 48, 50, 64 and/or 66, respectively.
          [0143]   As described herein, the nonwoven ribbon 32 of an absorbent structure 34
can be separated into individual units of fleece 30 which can have the same absorbent
structure 34 as was present in the nonwoven ribbon 32. The fleece 30 can be formed into
a blank 28 which can then be compressed into a pledget 12 of a tampon 10. In various
embodiments, the tampon 10 can have a cover 138 and a withdrawal aid 14.

          [0144]  In various embodiments a cover 138 can be provided. As used herein,
the term "cover" relates to materials that are in communication with and cover or enclose
surfaces of a pledget 12 to prevent the fibrous materials of the absorbent structure 34 from
directly contacting the inner walls of a woman's vagina and to reduce the ability of portions
(e.g., fibers and the like) from becoming separated from the pledget 12 or the tampon 10
and being left behind upon removal of the tampon 10 from the woman's vagina. In various
embodiments, the cover 138 can be a fluid-permeable cover 138. By "fluid-permeable" it
is meant that body fluid is able to pass through the cover 138. The cover 138 can be
hydrophobic or hydrophilic. By "hydrophilic" it is meant that the cover 138 has an affinity
for absorbing or tending to combine with water. By "hydrophobic" it is meant that the
cover 138 is antagonistic to or tending not to combine with water. The cover 138 can also
be treated with a surfactant or other material to make it hydrophilic or to make it more
hydrophilic.
          [0145]  The cover 138 can be bonded with: the nonwoven ribbon 32 prior to
separation into individual units of fleece 30, an individual unit of fleece 30, a blank 28
which has been formed from a fleece 30, or to the pledget 12 following compression of the
blank 28. In an embodiment in which the cover 138 is bonded with a pledget 12 following
compression of a blank 28, the cover 138 can be extensible such that the tampon 10 can
expand within the vaginal cavity. In an embodiment in which the absorbent structure 34 is
multi-layered, the cover 138 can be bonded with at least one layer of the absorbent
structure 34 before, after, or while the layer of the absorbent structure 34 is bonded to
another layer of the absorbent structure 34. The absorbent structure 34 can be in a
nonwoven ribbon 32 or can be in a fleece 30.
          [0146]  In various embodiments, the cover 138 can be formed from nonwoven
materials or apertured films. The nonwoven materials can include, but are not limited to,
materials such as natural fibers, synthetic fibers, or blends of natural and synthetic fibers.
Natural fibers include, but are not limited to, rayon, cotton, wood pulp, flax, and hemp.
Synthetic fibers can include, but are not limited to, fibers such as polyester, polyolefin,
nylon, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyacrylic, vinyl polyacetate, polyacrylate, cellulose
acetate, or bicomponent fibers, such as bicomponent polyethylene and polypropylene
fibers. The cover 138 can be made by any number of suitable techniques such as, for
example, being spunbonded, carded, hydroentangled, thermally bonded, and resin
bonded. In an embodiment, the cover 138 can be formed from an apertured thermoplastic
film having either a two-dimensional or a three-dimensional thickness. In an embodiment,

the cover 138 can be a 12 gsm smooth calendared material made from bicomponent,
polyethylene sheath and polyester core, fibers such as Sawabond 4189 available from
Sandler AG, Schwarzenbach, Germany. In an embodiment, the cover 138 can be formed
from a single piece of material. In an embodiment, the cover 138 can be formed from
multiple discrete pieces of material which are bonded together. In an embodiment, the
cover 138 can be bleached. In an embodiment, the cover 138 can have a color.
        [0147]    In an embodiment, the cover 138 can be treated with an aqueous solution
to reduce frictional drag, to give the tampon 10 a permanent wettability, to enhance the
ease of insertion into and withdrawal from a woman's vagina, and combinations thereof.
In an embodiment, the cover 138 can be treated either before being rolled or folded up
with the fleece 30 into a blank 28 or after the blank 28 has been formed and the cover 138
has been bonded with the blank 28.
        [0148]    In various embodiments, at least a portion of a cover 138 can cover a
body facing surface 148, a portion of an interior surface 146, or combinations thereof of a
blank 28. FIG. 25 provides an illustration of a non-limiting embodiment in which at least a
portion of a cover 138 can cover a portion of a body facing surface 148 of a blank 28, such
as a softwind. As illustrated in FIG. 26A, in an embodiment, at least a portion of a cover
138 can cover a portion of an interior surface 146 of a blank 28 when a fleece 30 is
compressed, such as, for example, via side compression. As illustrated in FIG. 26A, in an
embodiment, at least a portion of the cover 138 can cover a combination of the body
facing surface 148 and the interior surface 146 of a blank 28. The interior surface 146 of
the blank 28 can result from folding, rolling, or otherwise manipulating the fleece 30 into
the blank 28. It is to be understood that in an embodiment, the interior surface 146 of the
pledget 12 may come into contact with the vaginal walls as the tampon 10 can expand
when contacted by body fluids. The expansion of the tampon 10 can, therefore, cause
exposure of the interior surface 146 of the pledget 12 to the vaginal walls and body fluid.
As illustrated in FIG. 26B, in an embodiment two covers 138 can be in communication with
a fleece 30 which can be compressed, such as, for example, via side compression, into a
blank 28. As illustrated in FIG. 26B, in such an embodiment, at least a portion of each of
the covers 138 can cover a portion of an interior surface 146 of a blank 28 of a pledget 12.
In such an embodiment, at least a portion of each of the covers 138 can cover a
combination of the body facing surface 148 and the interior surface 146 of a blank 28 of a
pledget 12. In various embodiments, the cover 138 can extend beyond the withdrawal
end 20 of the pledget 12 to form a skirt 150 as illustrated in FIG. 27. It is to be understood

that, in an embodiment, the cover 138 can extend beyond the insertion end 18 of a
pledget 12.
         [0149]   In an embodiment, the cover 138 can have two edges, 152 and 154. As
noted above, the cover 138 can be bonded to a nonwoven ribbon 32, a fleece 30, a blank
28, or a pledget 12. In an embodiment, during the bonding process, at least one of the
edges, 152 or 154, of the cover 138 can be substantially aligned with one of the
transverse edges, such as transverse edges 48 and 50 or 64 or 66. In an embodiment,
during the bonding process, the cover 138 can be bonded to the nonwoven ribbon 32, the
fleece 30, the blank 28, or the pledget 12 so as to produce a spiral or helical pattern on the
resulting pledget 12. In an embodiment, the two edges, 152 and 154, can be
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 16 of a pledget 12. In an embodiment, the two
edges, 152 and 154, can be positioned in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis 16 of
a pledget 12 or at any other angle to the longitudinal axis 16 of a pledget 12 such as may
occur if the cover 138 is spirally wound about the pledget 12. Thus, while the cover 138
and the edges, 152 and 154, may be discussed herein in an orientation perpendicular to
the longitudinal axis 16 of a pledget 12, one of ordinary skill will be able to recognize how
to provide a cover 138 and edges, 152 and 154, in an orientation parallel with the
longitudinal axis 16 of a pledget 12 or in an orientation having any other angle in relation
to the longitudinal axis 16 of a pledget 12.
         [0150]   In an embodiment, the cover 138 can have uniform properties. In an
embodiment, the cover 138 can have non-uniform properties. In such an embodiment, the
cover 138 can have regions with differing properties which can be coordinated to increase
or decrease absorbency and/or level of expansion of the tampon 10. For example, a
region can be more hydrophilic or hydrophobic in comparison to another region of the
cover 138. In an embodiment, the hydrophilic region of the cover 138 could substantially
cover the portion of the tampon 10 that would contact the menses first to increase menses
absorption and as a result increase expansion of that portion of the tampon 10.
         [0151]   The regions of the cover 138 with differing properties may be produced by
various methods. One example of a method is by treating the regions of the cover 138
with chemical finishes, such as hydrophilic or hydrophobic finishes that make the regions
either more hydrophilic or more hydrophobic, respectively. The regions can also be
mechanically altered. Any method known in the art of mechanically altering non-wovens
or films can be used. Mechanically altering includes, but is not limited to, processes such
as ring-rolling, corrugating, SELFing, and aperturing.

         [0152]    The composition of the cover 138 can also provide for differing properties
of the cover 138. Different regions of the cover 138 can be produced from different
materials. For example, one region of the cover 138 may have a higher concentration of
rayon than another section of the cover 138 to make that region more hydrophilic.
Materials could be selected for any property desired for a cover 138 known in the art, such
as a selection of a material to provide a region of the cover 138 with greater extensibility.
In an embodiment, the cover 138 may include multiple discrete pieces that are bonded
together to form a single cover 138. The discrete pieces can have differing properties
such as described above. In an embodiment, the discrete pieces of the cover 138 may
form the different regions of the cover 138 such as described above. In such an
embodiment, one discrete piece may form one region and another discrete piece may
form a different region of the cover 138. The discrete pieces can be bonded by any
method known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as sewing, adhesive, thermal
bonding, fusion bonding, or combinations thereof.
         [0153]    As illustrated in FIG. 28, in an embodiment, the cover 138 can have at
least one slit 156. In an embodiment, the slit(s) 156 can be located between the two
edges, 152 and 154, of the cover 138. In such an embodiment, the slit 156 can form a
cover contact element 162. In an embodiment, the slit(s) 156 can be associated with at
least one of the edges, 152 and/or 154. In an embodiment, at least one slit 156 can be
associated with at least one of the edges, 152 and/or 154, and at least one slit 156 can be
located between the two edges, 152 and 154. In an embodiment in which slits 156 are
associated with at least one of the edges, 152 and 154, the cover 138 can have at least
two slits 156 which can form a cover contact element 162. The cover contact element 162
can come into contact with the walls of the vagina and can direct fluid flow towards the
tampon 10. In an embodiment, the cover 138 can have at least one cover contact element
162. In an embodiment, the cover 138 can have at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10
cover contact elements 162. In an embodiment, the cover 138 can have from about 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 to about 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20 cover contact
elements 162. In an embodiment, a cover contact element 162 can be oriented
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 16 of a tampon 10. In an embodiment, a cover
contact element 162 can be oriented parallel with the longitudinal axis 16 of a tampon 10.
In an embodiment, a cover contact element 162 can be oriented at any angle as desired to
the longitudinal axis 16 of a tampon 10.

with a slit 96 of a layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38. In an embodiment, a slit 156 can
be offset from a slit 96 of a layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38. In an embodiment, a
slit 156 of a cover 138 can be substantially aligned with a slit 96 of a layer(s), such as
layer(s) 36 and/or 38, and a slit 156 of a cover 138 can be offset from a slit 96 of a
layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38. In the non-limiting embodiment illustrated in FIG.
28, the slits 156 of the cover 138 can be substantially aligned with the slits 96 of a layer of
the absorbent structure 34. In such an embodiment, a slit 156 in the cover 138 can allow
the contact element 88 to expand in a direction away from the tampon 10 and to deform
and flex away from the tampon 10. In an embodiment, the length of a slit 156 in the cover
 138 can be any length deemed suitable. In an embodiment, the length of a slit 156 in the
cover 138 can be substantially similar to the length 98 of a slit 96 in a layer(s), such as
layer(s) 36 and/or 38. In an embodiment, a width between two successive slits 156 in the
cover 138 can be any width as deemed suitable. In an embodiment, the width between
two successive slits 156 in the cover 138 can be substantially similar to the width 102
between two successive slits 96 in one of the layers, 36 and/or 38. In an embodiment, the
length of a slit 156 and the width between two successive slits 156 in the cover 138 can be
substantially similar to or different from the length 98 of a slit 96 and the width 102
between slits 96 in a layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, when the slits 156 in a cover
 138 substantially align with the slits 96 in a layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, or
when the slits 156 in a cover 138 are offset from the slits 96 in a layer(s), such as layer(s)
36 and/or 38. In an embodiment, a cover contact element 162 can substantially align with
a contact element 88 of a layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38. In an embodiment, a
cover contact element 162 can be offset from a contact element 88 of a layer(s), such as
layer(s) 36 and/or 38.
         [0155]    In various embodiments, the pledget 12 may be subject to further
processing to result in a finished tampon. For example, the pledget 12 may be joined with
a withdrawal aid 14 and/or applicator.
         [0156]    The withdrawal aid 14 may be attached to the pledget 12 in any suitable
manner. For example, an opening can be formed through the pledget 12 (and cover 138 if
provided) so as to provide a means for attaching a withdrawal aid 14. In various
embodiments, the withdrawal aid 14 can be attached to the fibrous material before or after
it is compressed into the pledget 12. The withdrawal aid 14 can be attached to the fibrous
material and then looped upon itself. As illustrated in FIG. 29, the withdrawal aid 14 can

be associated with the nonwoven ribbon 32 and can further be associated with the fleece
30. In such an embodiment, the withdrawal aid 14 can be, as illustrated, wound with the
fleece 30 in the formation of a blank 28. A knot 144 can be formed near the free ends of
the withdrawal aid 14 to assure that the withdrawal aid 14 does not separate from the
fibrous material. The knot 144 can also serve to prevent fraying of the withdrawal aid 14
and to provide a location where a woman can grasp the withdrawal aid 14 when she is
ready to remove the tampon 10 from her vagina.
          [0157]   The withdrawal aid 14 can be constructed from various types of threads or
ribbons. A thread or ribbon can be made from 100% cotton fibers and/or other materials
in whole or part. The withdrawal aid 14 can be bonded to the absorbent fibers with or
without tying. The withdrawal aid 14 can have any suitable length and/or the withdrawal
aid 14 can be dyed and/or treated with an anti-wicking agent, such as wax, before being
secured to the pledget 12.
          [0158]   FIG. 29 provides a non-limiting illustration of an embodiment of a method
of manufacturing a blank 28 of the present disclosure. A nonwoven ribbon 32 which can
have an absorbent structure 34, can ultimately result in a blank 28. In an embodiment, the
absorbent structure 34 of the nonwoven ribbon 32 can be a single layer. In an
embodiment, the absorbent structure of the nonwoven ribbon 32 can be multi-layered.
The absorbent structure 34 of the nonwoven ribbon 32, can be manufactured via a multi
bank laydown process, a process whereby pre-formed fibrous material layers are bonded
together, or a combination thereof. During the manufacture of the absorbent structure 34
of the nonwoven ribbon 32, the absorbent structure 34 can have any configuration of
layers as desired. During the manufacture of a multi-layered absorbent structure 34 of a
nonwoven ribbon 32, the layers can be configured into any desired configuration, such as,
but not limited to, the configurations described and illustrated herein. The nonwoven
ribbon 32 illustrated in FIG. 29 can have an absorbent structure 34 which can have two
layers, 36 and 38, which can be placed into communication with each other. In an
embodiment, the two layers, 36 and 38, can be bonded to each other after they are placed
into communication with each other. Each of the layers, 36 and 38, can have transverse
edges, such as transverse edges 48 and 50 of layer 36 and 64 and 66 of layer 38. In the
non-limiting illustration of FIG. 29, transverse edge 50 of first layer 36 can be substantially
aligned with transverse edge 66 of second layer 38. As illustrated in the non-limiting
illustration of FIG. 29, the first layer 36 can have a first length 44 which can be longer than
a second length 60 of second layer 38. As noted herein, the two layers, 36 and 38, can be

arranged into any desired configuration including, but not limited to, any of the
configurations described and illustrated herein. As described herein, at least one slit 96
can be incorporated into at least one of the layers, 36 and/or 38, forming the absorbent
structure 34 of the nonwoven ribbon 32. The slit(s) 96 can be incorporated into at least
one of the layer(s), such as layer(s) 36 and/or 38, prior to, after, or while placing one of the
layers of the absorbent structure 34 into communication with another layer of the
absorbent structure 34. In the non-limiting illustration of FIG. 29, the slit(s) 96 can be
associated with a transverse edge of one of the layers, 36 and/or 38, such as transverse
edge 48 of layer 36. As described herein, in an embodiment, at least one slit 96 can be
incorporated into at least one of the layers, 36 and/or 38, in such a configuration so as to
not be associated with one of the transverse edges of either of the layers, 36 and/or 38. In
the non-limiting embodiment illustrated, a first layer 36 having two transverse edges, 48
and 50, can be provided and a plurality of slits 96 can be associated with transverse edge
48 to form at least one contact element 88. As discussed herein, in an embodiment, a
contact element 88 can be associated with any of the transverse edges or can be located
between the transverse edges of a layer. As illustrated in the non-limiting embodiment
shown in FIG. 29, the contact elements 88 can be associated with transverse edge 48 of
layer 36. The nonwoven ribbon 32 can also be provided with a cover 138 and a
withdrawal aid 14. As noted above, to create a blank 28, the nonwoven ribbon 32 can be
separated into individual units of fleece 30. The separation of the nonwoven ribbon 32
into individual units of fleece 30 can occur by any suitable method such as stretching,
perforating, or cutting such as with the use of a die cutter or a knife cutter, and the like. As
illustrated in FIG. 29, the nonwoven ribbon 32 can be provided with perforation cuts 140
which can facilitate the separation of the nonwoven ribbon 32 into individual units of fleece
30. The cover 138 can be provided to the nonwoven ribbon 32 before the nonwoven
ribbon 32 has been separated into an individual unit of fleece 30 and can be provided in
such a way as to span at least a portion of the perforation cuts 140.
         [0159]   As noted above, the nonwoven ribbon 32 can be separated into individual
units of fleece 30 which can be rolled, stacked, folded or otherwise manipulated into
blanks 28 before the blanks 28 are formed into pledgets 12. For example, suitable
menstrual tampons may include "cup" shaped pledgets like those disclosed in U.S.
Publication No. 2008/0287902 to Edgett and U.S. 2,330,257 to Bailey; "accordion" or "W
folded" pledgets like those disclosed in U.S. 6,837,882 to Agyapong; "radially wound"
pledgets like those disclosed in U.S. 6,310,269 to Friese; "sausage" type or "wad"
pledgets like those disclosed in U.S. 2,464,310 to Harwood; "M-folded" tampon pledgets

disclosed in U.S. 2008/0132868 to Jorgensen; or "bag" type tampon pledgets like those
disclosed in U.S. 3,815,601 to Schaefer.
         [0160]   As illustrated in FIG. 29, the fleece 30 can be radially wound into a blank
28, such as a softwind. As illustrated in FIG. 29, the nonwoven ribbon 32 can be
separated into individual units of fleece 30, which can undergo a radial winding process,
illustrated by the partially wound unit 142, to result in a blank 28. A suitable method for
making "radial wound" pledgets is disclosed in U.S. 4,816,100 to Friese. The radial
winding method can also include a method for forming the blank into a pledget like that
disclosed in U.S. 6,310,269 to Friese. Suitable methods for making "W-folded" pledgets
are disclosed in U.S. 6,740,070 to Agyapong; U.S. 7,677,189 to Kondo; and U.S.
2010/0114054 to Mueller. A suitable method for making "cup" pledgets and "stacked"
pledgets is disclosed in U.S. 2008/0132868 to Jorgensen.
         [0161]   In various embodiments, the blank 28 can be formed into a pledget 12. In
an embodiment, forming the blank 28 into a pledget 12 can include a compressing step
which can utilize any suitable means and apparatus. For example, the compressing step
may utilize a plurality of dies which reciprocate relative to one another so as to form a
mold cavity therebetween. When the blank 28 (e.g., a softwind) is positioned within the
mold cavity, the dies may be actuated so as to move tangent to or towards one another,
tangent to or towards the blank 28 and compress the blank 28. The blank 28 may be
compressed any suitable amount. For example, the blank 28 may be compressed at least
about 25%, 50%, or 75% of the initial dimensions. For example, a blank 28 can be
reduced in diameter to approximately 1% of the original diameter. The cross-sectional
configuration of the resultant pledget 12 may be circular, ovular, rectangular, hexagonal,
or any other suitable shape.
         [0162]   In various embodiments, the compressing step may not include any
additional heat applied to the pledget 12. In other words, the blank 28 can be compressed
into a pledget 12 without external heat being applied to the compression equipment or the
blank 28. In various embodiments, the compressing step may incorporate or may be
followed by one or more additional stabilization steps. This secondary stabilization can
serve to maintain the compressed shape of the pledget 12. In general, the secondary
stabilization step can create hydrogen bonds between the absorbent fibers and/or may
further strengthen the entanglement of the absorbent fibers to maintain the shape of the
compressed pledget 12.

          [0163]    FIG. 30 provides a non-limiting illustration of an embodiment of a method
of manufacturing a nonwoven ribbon 32 of the present disclosure. A nonwoven ribbon 32
which can have an absorbent structure 34, can ultimately result in a blank 28. In an
embodiment, the absorbent structure 34 of the nonwoven ribbon 32 can be a single layer.
In an embodiment, the absorbent structure of the nonwoven ribbon 32 can be multi
layered. As described herein, the absorbent structure 34 of the nonwoven ribbon 32, can
be manufactured via a multi-bank laydown process, a process whereby pre-formed fibrous
material layers are bonded together, or a combination thereof.         During the manufacture
of the absorbent structure 34 of the nonwoven ribbon 32, the absorbent structure 34 can
have any configuration of layers as desired. During the manufacture of a multi-layered
absorbent structure 34 of a nonwoven ribbon 32, the layers can be configured into any
desired configuration, such as, but not limited to, the configurations described and
illustrated herein. The nonwoven ribbon 32 illustrated in FIG. 30 can have an absorbent
structure 34 which can have two layers, 36 and 38, which can be placed into
communication with each other. In an embodiment, the two layers, 36 and 38, can be
bonded to each other after having been placed into communication with each other. Each
of the layers, 36 and 38, can have transverse edges, such as transverse edges 48 and 50
of layer 36 and 64 and 66 of layer 38. In the non-limiting illustration of FIG. 30, transverse
edge 50 of first layer 36 can be substantially aligned with transverse edge 66 of second
layer 38. As illustrated in the non-limiting illustration of FIG. 30, the first layer 36 can have
a first length 44 which can be longer than a second length 60 of second layer 38. As
noted herein, the two layers, 36 and 38, can be arranged into any desired configuration
including, but not limited to, any of the configurations described and illustrated herein. In
the non-limiting embodiment illustrated, a fold 110 can be incorporated into first layer 36.
The fold 110 can bring transverse edge 48 of layer 36 into communication with transverse
edge 64 of layer 38. As discussed herein, additional folds can be incorporated into the
absorbent structure 34 as desired and into any configuration as desired. As described
herein, at least one slit 96 can be incorporated into at least one of the layers, 36 and/or 38,
forming the absorbent structure 34 of the nonwoven ribbon 32. The slit(s) 96 can be
incorporated into at least one of the layer(s), such as layers 36 and/or 38, prior to, after, or
while placing one of the layers of the absorbent structure 34 into communication with
another layer of the absorbent structure 34. In the non-limiting illustration of FIG. 30, the
slit(s) 96 can be associated with the fold 110 of first layer 36. As illustrated in FIG. 30, a
plurality of slits 96 can be associated with the fold 110 of first layer 36 to form at least one
contact element 88. As discussed herein, in an embodiment, a contact element 88 can be

                                                52

associated with any of the transverse edges, a fold, or can be located between the
transverse edges of a layer. As described herein, in an embodiment, at least one slit 96
can be incorporated into at least one of the layers, 36 and/or 38, in such a configuration so
as to not be associated with one of the transverse edges of either of the layers, 36 and/or
38. The nonwoven ribbon 32 can also be provided with a cover 138 and a withdrawal aid
 14. As noted above, to create a blank 28, the nonwoven ribbon 32 can be separated into
individual units of fleece 30. The separation of the nonwoven ribbon 32 into individual
units of fleece 30 can occur by any suitable method such as stretching, perforating, or
cutting such as with the use of a die cutter or a knife cutter, and the like. As illustrated in
FIG. 30, the nonwoven ribbon 32 can be provided with perforation cuts 140 which can
facilitate the separation of the nonwoven ribbon 32 into individual units of fleece 30. The
cover 138 can be provided to the nonwoven ribbon 32 before the nonwoven ribbon 32 has
been separated into an individual unit of fleece 30 and can be provided in such a way as
to span at least a portion of the perforation cuts 140.
         [0164]   As illustrated in FIG. 30, the fleece 30 can be radially wound into a blank
28, such as a softwind. As illustrated in FIG. 30, the nonwoven ribbon 32 can be
separated into individual units of fleece 30, which can undergo a radial winding process,
illustrated by the partially wound unit 142, to result in a blank 28. As described herein, in
various embodiments, the blank 28 can be formed into a pledget 12.
         [0165]   In various embodiments, the pledget 12 may be subject to further
processing to result in a finished tampon. For example, the pledget 12 may be joined with
a withdrawal aid 14, such as described herein, and/or applicator.
         [0166]   The withdrawal aid 14 may be attached to the pledget 12 in any suitable
manner. For example, an opening can be formed through the pledget 12 (and cover 138 if
provided) so as to provide a means for attaching a withdrawal aid 14. In various
embodiments, the withdrawal aid 14 can be attached to the fibrous material before or after
it is compressed into the pledget 12. The withdrawal aid 14 can be attached to the fibrous
material and then looped upon itself. As illustrated in FIGs. 29 and 30, the withdrawal aid
 14 can be associated with the nonwoven ribbon 32 and can further be associated with the
fleece 30. In such an embodiment, the withdrawal aid 14 can be, as illustrated, wound
with the fleece 30 in the formation of a blank 28. A knot 144 can then be formed near the
free ends of the withdrawal aid 14 to assure that the withdrawal aid 14 does not separate
from the fibrous material. The knot 144 can also serve to prevent fraying of the withdrawal

aid 14 and to provide a place or point where a woman can grasp the withdrawal aid 14
when she is ready to remove the tampon 10 from her vagina.
        [0167]    In various embodiments, the tampon 10 may also include one or more
additional features. For example, the tampon 10 may include a "protection" feature as
exemplified by U.S. 6,840,927 to Hasse, U.S. 2004/0019317 to Takagi, U.S. 2,123,750 to
Schulz, and the like. In some embodiments, the tampon 10 may include an "anatomical"
shape as exemplified by U.S. 5,370,633 to Villalta, an "expansion" feature as exemplified
by U.S. 7,387,622 to Pauley, an "acquisition" feature as exemplified by U.S.
2005/0256484 to Chase, an "insertion" feature as exemplified by U.S. 2,112, 021 to Harris,
a "placement" feature as exemplified by U.S. 3,037,506 to Penska, or a "removal" feature
as exemplified by U.S. 6,142,984 to Brown.
        [0168]    FIGS. 31-40 illustrate one suitable embodiment of an apparatus, indicated
generally at 200, and method for making a tampon, and more particularly for making a
cover, such as a web (or ribbon) of cover material used to cover the pledget, such as
pledget 12, in forming the tampon 10. As illustrated schematically in FIGS. 31 and 32, the
apparatus 200 is for making a web of cover material from a pair of web materials, referred
to broadly herein as a first or base material and a second or absorbent material. It is
contemplated that the second material can have other properties in addition to or instead
of being absorbent, such as, but not limited to wicking and/or wiping.
        [0169]    Materials suitable for the base material and the absorbent material are
described above. For example, materials suitable for the base material can include
materials described above with respect to the cover 138 and materials suitable of the
absorbent material can include materials described above with respect to the absorbent
structure 34. In one suitable embodiment, the absorbent material has a tensile strength in
the MD direction of 2-38 Newtons per inch of width, a tensile strength in the CD direction
of 0.13-6 Newtons per inch of width, and a thickness in the range of 0.25-1 mm. Suitably,
the material used for the absorbent material is bondable, has a minimal Poisson's ratio, is
hydrophilic, is drapable and soft, and has minimal linting. In one suitable embodiment, the
base material, which is water permeable, has a tensile strength in the MD direction at of at
least 5-75 Newtons per inch of width, a tensile strength in the CD direction of 1-20
Newtons per inch. Suitably, the material used for the base material is bondable, has a
minimal Poisson's ratio, is drapable and soft, and has minimal linting.

         [0170]   As seen in FIGs. 31 and 32, the apparatus 200 includes a source of base
material, such as a wound roll 201 comprising a wound or rolled continuous web 205 of
base material, and a source of absorbent material, such as a wound roll 203 comprising a
wound or rolled continuous web 213 of absorbent material. It is understood, however, that
in other embodiments other suitable sources 201, 203 of base material and/or absorbent
material may be used (e.g., blocks, boxes, bins, formed in-line).
         [0171]   In an embodiment, the web 205 of base material and the web 213 of
absorbent material are unwound and moved throughout the apparatus in a machine
direction (referenced throughout the various FIGs. as machine direction MD) (i.e., the
direction in which the respective webs are moved forward through the apparatus). In the
illustrated embodiment, the web 205 of base material has a width sufficient to
simultaneously make a pair of side-by-side webs of cover material. For example, in one
embodiment, the web 205 of base material has a width in the range of 100 mm (about four
times the final width of the web of absorbent material) to about 150 mm (about six times
the final width of the web of absorbent material), and more particularly about 110 mm. It is
contemplated that the widths of the webs can be measured using any convention
measuring technique including rulers, photoeyes, vision cameras, web width sensors,
visual indicators, and combinations thereof.
         [0172]   The web 205 of base material is unwound from the roll 201 in the machine
direction MD by a suitable drive member 211, and passes through a tensioning member
209 and guide rolls 207 following unwinding from the roll. Suitable drive members,
tensioning members and guide rolls as used herein are conventional and thus not further
described herein except to the extent necessary to disclose the present invention. The
transverse, or cross-direction position of the web is established by the position of the
unwind equipment (e.g., roll, etc.). Conventional centering components (e.g., shepherds,
hooks, vertical idlers, and other suitable centering components) may be used to maintain
the transverse or CD position of the web 205 relative to the machine direction MD. In
addition to guide rolls, other conventional web handling components may be used to
maintain the orientation and centering of the web as it moves through the apparatus, such
as guide trays and the like. Suitable web guides and web guide controllers are
commercially available, such as, the Fife web guiding system.
         [0173]   Thus, both the web 205 of base material and the web 213 of absorbent
material are registered in both the MD and CD direction. In other words, both of the webs
205, 213 are aligned relative to one or more reference points. The one or more reference

                                               55

points can be a portion of the web 205, 213 itself, a portion of the other web, a component
(or portion thereof) of the apparatus 200, and/or combinations thereof. In one suitable
embodiment, CD registration of the webs 205, 213 is maintained within ±0-5 mm, and MD
registration of webs is maintained within ±0-2 mm. The web 213 of absorbent material is
centered at its desired location on the web 205 of base material within ±0-5 mm. Suitably,
one or more inspection systems can be used to ensure proper CD and MD registration of
the webs 205, 213.
          [0174]  In the illustrated embodiment, the web 213 of absorbent material on the
roll 203 has a width sufficient to simultaneously make a pair of side-by-side webs of cover
material. However, the width of the web 213 of absorbent material, in one embodiment, is
also narrower than the width of the web 205 of base material. For example, in one
embodiment the width of the web 213 of absorbent material on the roll 203 is in the range
of about 25 mm to about 70 mm, and more particularly about 50 mm. In other
embodiments, the web 205 of base material and the web 213 of absorbent material may
have respective widths sufficient to make a single web of cover material, or more than two
side-by-side webs of cover material. It is also contemplated that in other embodiments the
relative widths of the web 205 of base material and the web 213 of absorbent material
may be other than as described above.
          [0175]  The web 213 of absorbent material on the roll 203 is unwound from the
roll in the machine direction thereof by a suitable drive member 221, and passes through a
tensioning member 219 and guide rolls 217 following unwinding from the roll. The
transverse, or cross-direction position of the web 213 is established by the position of the
unwind equipment (e.g., roll, etc.). Conventional centering components (e.g., shepherds,
hooks, vertical idlers, and other suitable centering components) may be used to maintain
the transverse position of the web 213 relative to the machine direction MD. In addition to
guide rolls, other conventional web handling components may be used to maintain the
orientation and centering of the web 213 as it moves through the apparatus, such as guide
trays and the like. Suitable web guides and web guide controllers are commercially
available, such as, the Fife web guiding system.
          [0176]  A subsequent drive member 223 further moves the web 213 through a
slitter 225 where the web of absorbent material is slit longitudinally (i.e., in the machine
direction of the web) to form two separate side-by-side webs 213a, 213b of absorbent
material, each corresponding to what will become a respective web of cover material upon
association with the base material. The pair of absorbent material webs 213a, 213b is

                                               56

further passed over a series of turn rolls 227 to re-orient the webs and space them apart to
a desired alignment for subsequent overlayment with the web 205 of base material. It is
understood that the turn rolls 227 can be other suitable devices including, but not limited
to, fife guides, guide trays. The webs 213a, 213b of absorbent material are directed over
additional guide rolls, to the drive member 223 at which the webs of absorbent material
are overlayed onto the web 205 of base material. It is contemplated that the webs 213a,
213b of absorbent material can be overlayed onto the web 205 of base material before or
after the drive member 223. In one suitable embodiment, the webs 213a, 213b of
absorbent material are overlayed onto the web 205 of base material at a bonder anvil.
          [0177]  Tension in each of the webs 205, 213, in one embodiment, is established
using conventional devices, such as the respective drive members 211, 221, 223, spindle
friction (not shown), dancer roll 209, 219, closed loop tension feedback device (not shown)
and/or other suitable tension control devices. Web tensioning provides appropriate
material strain in each of the webs 205, 213 to prevent wrinkling, curl and/or tearing during
processing, and provides appropriate strain match during subsequent combining of the
webs as described later herein.
          [0178]  With reference to Fig. 34, in one embodiment the webs 213a, 213b of
absorbent material are overlayed onto the single web 205 of base material in transversely
spaced (relative to the machine direction MD of the web) relationship with each other, but
transversely inward from respective side edges 231 of the web of base material to allow
for subsequent folding of the web of base material. For example, in one embodiment, the
webs 213a, 213b of absorbent material are transversely spaced in the range of about 90
mm to about 130 mm from each other, and more particularly about 100 mm. The webs
213a, 213b are transversely spaced from the respective side edges 231 of the web 205 of
base material a distance of about 0 mm to about 55 mm and more particularly about 55
mm, the reasons for which will become apparent. It is understood that the webs 213a,
213b of absorbent material can be transversely spaced from each and the respective side
edge 231 by other suitable distances. The respective speeds of the webs 205, 213, i.e.,
the speed of movement in the machine direction MD, at the instant of overlayment are, in
one embodiment, equal. In another embodiment, the webs 205, 213 may be moving at
different speeds as overlayment occurs. The speeds of the webs 205, 213 can be
controlled, for example, by servo motors, mechanical linkages, and the like.

         [0179]    It is contemplated that the webs 213a, 213b of absorbent material can be
placed beneath the web 205 of base material or that the web of base material can be
overlayed onto webs 213a, 213b of absorbent material. It is also contemplated that the
webs 213a 213b of absorbent material can be placed on opposite faces of the web 205 of
base material. For example, one of the webs 213a of absorbent material can be placed
beneath the web 205 of base material and the other web 213b of absorbent material can
be overlayed onto the web of absorbent material.
         [0180]    The overlayed webs 213a, 213b of absorbent material and web 205 of
base material are then moved by a suitable drive member 233 through a bonding
apparatus 235 for a bonding operation (broadly, a first securement) in which the webs of
absorbent material are bonded (i.e., secured) to the web of base material. The bonding
can occur by any method deemed suitable including, but not limited to, adhesives, heat
bonding, vibration energy, mechanical bonding, chemical bonding, vacuum bonding,
ultrasonic bonds, thermal bonds, pressure bonds, mechanical entanglement,
hydroentanglement, microwave bonds, or any other conventional technique. The bonding
can be continuous or it can be intermittent.
         [0181]    In one embodiment, the bonding apparatus is suitable for autogenous
bonding, which as used herein means bonding provided by fusion and/or self-adhesion of
fibers and/or filaments without an applied external adhesive or bonding agent.
Autogenous bonding can be provided by contact between fibers and/or filaments while at
least a portion of the fibers and/or filaments are semi-molten or tacky. Autogenous
bonding may also be provided by blending a tackifying resin with the thermoplastic
polymers used to form the fibers and/or filaments. Fibers and/or filaments formed from
such a blend can be adapted to self-bond with or without the application of pressure
and/or heat. Solvents may also be used to cause fusion of fibers and filaments which
remain after the solvent is removed.
         [0182]    In one embodiment, the autogenous bonding is thermal point bonding, or
pattern bonding, conducted by a suitable thermal point bonding apparatus 235 which
involves passing the web between a heated calendar roll and an anvil roll. The calendar
roll is usually, but not always, patterned in some way so that the entire fabric is not bonded
across its entire surface, and the anvil roll is usually flat. As a result, various patterns for
calendar rolls have been developed for functional as well as aesthetic reasons. For
example, in the illustrated embodiment, the apparatus 235 bonds the webs 213a, 213b of
absorbent materials to the web 205 of base material along a predetermined pattern of

                                                58

point bonds, such as the pattern of staggered point bonds 237 illustrated schematically in
Figs. 35 and 36. Other potential point bond patterns include staggered dashes, curved
bond lines, or a combination of abstract, geometrical or realistic shapes and objects.
Securing the webs 213a, 213b of absorbent materials to the web 205 of base material at
this stage of manufacture allows for subsequent folding and processing of the webs while
maintaining desired registration and alignment therebetween. In other embodiments, the
first securement may be provided by thermal bonding, adhesive bonding or other suitable
securement techniques. It is also understood that, in some embodiments, the webs 213a,
213b of absorbent material can be held in registration with the web 205 of base material
using other suitable methods (e.g., vacuum conveyors).
         [0183]    Following this first securement operation, the secured webs 213a, 213b,
205 of absorbent material and base material together form a web 239 of cover material
that in the illustrated embodiment is actually a pair of side-by-side (and at this stage
connected) webs of cover material. The web 239 of cover material is then drawn by the
drive member 233 through a folding station, which is generally indicated at 241. All of the
folding stations of the illustrated apparatus 200 perform web alignment by creating a
repeatable folded edge ensuring CD alignment of the web. In one embodiment, the
folding station 241 is configured to fold transversely outward segments 243 of base
material transversely inward over the entire respective web 213a, 213b of absorbent
material to substantially enclose the web of absorbent material between opposed layers of
the web of base material. Suitable folding devices include, without limitation, folding
boards, folding skis, folding fingers, GEO folder and the like and combinations thereof.
Additionally in an embodiment, the folding station 241 and first securement are designed
to fold the web 205 of base material tightly around and in constant contact with the webs
213a, 231b of absorbent material. Thus, the web 205 of base material is inhibited from
puckering, wrinkling or otherwise misalignment with the webs 213a, 213b of absorbent
material.
         [0184]    Figure 37 schematically illustrates the cross-section of the web 239 of
cover material following folding at this folding station 241. In this embodiment, the inward
folded transverse segments of the web 205 of base material extend transversely inward
beyond inner side edges 245 of the respective webs 213a, 213b of absorbent material
such that a portion of the opposed layers of the base material web face each other without
any web of absorbent material therebetween. In other embodiments, the transverse
segments of the web 205 of base material may extend transversely inward to the

                                              59

respective inner side edges 245 of the webs 213a, 213b of absorbent material, or extend
short of the respective inner side edges of the webs of absorbent material.
        [0185]     The folded web 239 of cover material is subsequently drawn by a suitable
drive member 247 through another folding station, generally indicated at 251, for
additional folding. Suitable folding devices include, without limitation, folding boards,
folding skis, folding fingers, GEO folder and the like and combinations thereof. In one
embodiment, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 38, the already folded portion of the web
239 of cover material is further folded transversely inward upon itself. More particularly, it
is folded over such that the web 213a, 213b of absorbent material is folded generally in
half. In other embodiments, the already folded portion of the web 239 of cover material
may be folded over upon itself more or less than illustrated in Fig. 38 without departing
from the scope of this invention.
        [0186]     The folded web 239 of cover material is directed through a securement
station, generally indicated at 255, comprising a bonding apparatus for a second bonding
operation (broadly, a second securement) in which the webs 213a, 213b, 205 of absorbent
material and base material are bonded (i.e., secured) together at the folded portions
thereof in order to secure the web of cover material in its folded configuration. The
bonding can occur by any method deemed suitable including, but not limited to,
adhesives, heat bonding, vibration energy, mechanical bonding, chemical bonding,
vacuum bonding, ultrasonic bonds, thermal bonds, pressure bonds, mechanical
entanglement, hydroentanglement, microwave bonds, or any other conventional
technique. The bonding can be continuous or it can be intermittent.
        [0187]     In one embodiment, the bonding apparatus is suitable for autogenous
bonding. In an embodiment, the autogenous bonding is ultrasonic bonding performed by
suitable ultrasonic bonding apparatus 255 that ultrasonically bonds all of the layers of the
folded portions of the web 239 of cover material together in a predetermined bond pattern.
For example, in the illustrated embodiment the apparatus 255 bonds the webs 213a,
213b, 205 of absorbent material and base material together at the folded portions thereof
along a predetermined pattern of point bonds, such as the repeating but otherwise non
uniform (i.e., not symmetric in the machine direction and/or the transverse direction) snail
shaped pattern of point bonds illustrated schematically in Fig. 39. Other potential point
bond patterns include staggered dots and/or dashes, curved bond lines, or a combination
of abstract, geometrical or realistic shapes and objects. In other embodiments, the bond

pattern may be any suitable bond pattern. For example, the bond pattern may be another
suitable non-uniform bond pattern, or it may be any suitable uniform bond pattern.
         [0188]   The bond pattern in one embodiment is sufficient to provide an adequate
number of bonds, or adequate bonded surface area, for each of the later-formed contact
elements 162 (Fig. 28), e.g., formed by the slits 156 in the cover 138. In an embodiment,
the bond pattern may be sufficient to provide an equal number of point bonds, or an even
distribution of bonded surface area, over each of the later-formed contact elements 162.
In another embodiment, the bond pattern may provide an unequal number of point bonds,
or a non-uniform distribution of bonded surface area, over multiple later-formed contact
elements 162.
         [0189]   In an embodiment, this second bonding (i.e., second securement)
operation provides a bond having a bond strength that is greater than the bond strength
provided by the first bonding (i.e., first securement) operation. It is understood that the
bond strength, for example, can be controlled by pressure, energy, temperature, time and
pattern used in the bonding process. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the
bond pattern provided by this second bonding operation has a higher bond point density
and/or a higher bonded surface area than the bond pattern provided by the first bonding
operation. In addition, the second bonding operation of the illustrated embodiment is
operated at a temperature sufficient to melt the webs 213a, 213b of absorbent material
and to the web 205 of base material whereas the first bonding operation is not operated at
such a temperature.
         [0190]   In an embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 33, the securement station further
comprises an additional bonding apparatus 261. In the illustrated embodiment, the
additional bonding apparatus 261 is also an ultrasonic bonding apparatus and is operable
to bond the folded portions of the web 239 of cover material at a location that is at least in
part different from the location at which the bond pattern is applied by the upstream
bonding apparatus. More particularly, this bonding apparatus 261 bonds at least the
folded portion of the web 205 of base material at which the opposed layers of base
material face each other without intervening absorbent material therebetween. In one
embodiment, as illustrated in Fig. 40, this additional bonding apparatus 261 additionally
bonds all of the layers of the folded portion of the web 239 of cover material together
generally along the inner side edges 245 of the respective webs 213a, 213b of absorbent
material. This additional bonding operation securely encloses the webs 213a, 213b of
absorbent material within the folded web 205 of base material.

         [0191]    In one embodiment, the bond pattern produced by this additional bonding
operation is a uniform, generally sinusoidal (e.g., wave) bond pattern. In other
embodiments, the bond pattern produced by this additional bonding operation may be any
suitable uniform or non-uniform bond pattern. For example, in one embodiment, the bond
pattern is an intermittent, offset stitch pattern to inhibit CD movement of the web as it
passes through the apparatus 200. The bond strength provided by this additional bonding
operation is also greater than the bond strength provided by the first bonding (i.e., first
securement) operation.
         [0192]    Downstream of the securement station, the folded and bonded web 239 of
cover material is subsequently drawn through a slitter 271 which is operable to slit the web
of cover material into two discrete, side-by-side webs of cover material (FIGs. 31 and 33).
For example, the web 239 of cover material may be slit along the transverse mid-point of
the web, transversely inward of each of the folded portions of the web. In such an
embodiment, each web 239 of cover material thus includes a folded portion and an
unfolded portion comprised only of the base material.
         [0193]    In the embodiment illustrated in Figs. 31 and 33, the webs 239a, 239b of
cover material are further drawn through a die cutter 273 or other suitable cutting
apparatus. The die cutter 273 is operable to cut slits in the folded portion of each of the
webs of cover material, such as to form the slits 156 and corresponding contact elements
162 of the embodiment of Fig. 28. In an embodiment, the die cutter 273 may be operable
to cut the slits in a pattern in which a set of equally spaced slits is cut into the folded
portions of the webs 239 of cover material along a segment corresponding to the length of
cover material to be applied to a single pledget to form a single tampon, followed by a
relatively larger gap before the next set of equally spaced slits along a segment
corresponding to the next length of cover material to applied to another pledget to form
another tampon. In this embodiment, the gap can be used as a point of registration during
further processing (e.g., cutting, bonding) of the webs 239a, 239b of cover material.
         [0194]    In another embodiment, which is illustrated in FIG. 41, the die cutter 273
may be operable to cut the slits 96 such that each slit is equally spaced in the folded
portions of the webs 239 of cover material along a segment P1 corresponding to the
length of cover material to be applied to a single pledget to form a single tampon, followed
by the next set of equally spaced slits along a segment P2 corresponding to the next
length of cover material to applied to another pledget to form another tampon. Thus, in
this embodiment, each tampon 10 has the same number of contact elements 196 and

                                                62
PCT

27839-03871
each of the contact elements 196 has the same width W and the same length L1. In the
illustrated embodiment, for example, each of the tampons 10 formed from the web 239
would have seven complete (i.e., whole) contact elements 196. It is understood, however,
that number of contact elements 196 per tampon 10, the width W of each of the contact
elements, and length Li of each of the contact elements can differ. In yet another
embodiment, the die cutter 273 may be omitted from the apparatus 200. In such an
embodiment, the slits 96 can be formed in a later process as described in more detail
below.
          [0195]   In an embodiment, after passing the die cutter 273 (or the slitter 271 if the
die cutter is omitted) the webs 239a, 239b of cover material are wound onto respective
rolls (not shown) for subsequent transport to a tampon making apparatus where the webs
of cover material are each cut into discrete webs of cover material and applied about the
circumference of an absorbent structure, such as a pledget 12, to form a tampon. In one
suitable embodiment, one or both of the webs 239a, 239b of cover material is turned over
about its centerline longitudinally before being wound into a roll. Winding of the webs
239a, 239b of cover material, in one suitable embodiment, can be done in a traverse
spooling pattern and can be controlled (e.g., by steering devices, servos) such that the
continuous longitudinal support structure of the web (unslit portion, or folded portion
depending on die cutter placement) is registered to adjacent windings in the CD and radial
layers in order to provide roll stability and prevent damage to the webs including any
contact elements.
          [0196]   Figures 42-50 illustrate another embodiment of an apparatus, indicated
generally at 300, and method for making a tampon, and more particularly for making a
cover, such as a web (or ribbon) of cover 138 used to cover the pledget, such as pledget
12, in forming the tampon. In this embodiment, a folding station, generally indicated at
381 in Figs. 42 and 43, is disposed adjacent and prior to the drive member 223 (after the
web 213 of absorbent material is split into the pair of side-by-side webs 213a, 213b of
absorbent material) and the joint drive roll 229 (at which the webs of absorbent material
are overlaid onto the web 205 of base material) in the machine direction of the webs of
absorbent material. Suitable folding devices include, without limitation, folding boards,
folding skis, folding fingers, GEO folder and the like and combinations thereof. At this
initial folding station 381, each of the webs 213a, 213b of absorbent material is folded
transversely inward upon at least a portion of itself. For example, in one embodiment,
illustrated in Fig. 45, the transversely outermost one-third of each of the webs 213a, 213b

                                               63

of absorbent material is folded transversely inward at this initial folding station. In other
embodiments, more or less than one-third of the outermost portion of each web 213a,
213b of absorbent material may be folded transversely inward over another portion
thereof. In other embodiments, an innermost portion of each web 213a, 213b of
absorbent material may be folded transversely outward over another portion thereof, or
both an innermost portion and an outermost portion of each web of absorbent material
may be folded over another portion thereof.
         [0197]   The initially folded webs 213a, 213b of absorbent material are then drawn
over the joint drive roll 229 where the webs of absorbent material are overlaid onto the
web 205 of base material in transversely spaced (relative to the machine direction of the
web) relationship with each other, but transversely inward from the respective side edges
231 of the web of base material (as illustrated in the embodiment of Fig. 46) for reasons
which will become apparent. For example, in one embodiment the webs 213a, 213b of
absorbent material are transversely spaced in the range of about 0 mm to about 55 mm
from each other, and more particularly about 2 mm. The webs 213a, 213b are
transversely spaced from the respective side edges 231 of the web 205 of base material a
distance of about 0 mm to about 10 mm and more particularly about 3 mm.
         [0198]   The overlayed webs 213, 205 of absorbent material and web of base
material are then moved by the drive member 233 through the bonding apparatus 235 for
a bonding operation (broadly, a first securement) in which the webs of absorbent material
are bonded (i.e., secured) to the web of base material. As discussed above, in one
embodiment the bonding apparatus is a point bonding apparatus that bonds the webs of
absorbent materials to the web of base material along a pattern of point bonds 237 as
illustrated schematically in Figs. 46 and 47. Securing the webs 213a, 213b of absorbent
material to the web 205 of base material at this stage of manufacture allows for
subsequent folding and processing of the webs while maintaining desired registration and
alignment therebetween. In other embodiments, the first securement may be provided by
thermal bonding, adhesive bonding or other suitable securement techniques.
         [0199]   With reference to Figs. 42 and 44, following this first securement
operation, the secured webs 213, 205 of absorbent material and base material together
form a web 239 of cover material that in the illustrated embodiment is actually a pair of
side-by-side (and at this stage connected) webs 239a, 239b of cover material. The web
239 of cover material is then drawn by the drive member 247 through the folding station,
generally indicated at 251. In one embodiment this folding station 251 is configured to fold

each of the initially folded webs 213a, 213b of absorbent material transversely inward over
at least another portion of itself to define three layers of the folded absorbent material as
illustrated in Fig. 48. The web 205 of base material underlying each of the folded portions
of the webs 213a, 213b of absorbent material is folded along with the webs of the
absorbent material, with the side edges 231 of the web of base material extending
transversely inward beyond the inner side edges 245 of the folded webs of absorbent
material such that a portion of opposed layers of the base material web face each other
without any absorbent material therebetween. In other embodiments, the webs 213a,
213b of absorbent material may be folded other than in segments of equal width. In
another embodiment, the side edges 231 of the web 205 of base material may extend
transversely inward to the respective inner side edges 245 of the webs 213a, 213b of
absorbent material, or extend short of the respective inner side edges of the webs of
absorbent material.
         [0200]    The drive member 253, which is disposed downstream of the folding
station 251, also draws the folded web 239 of cover material through a securement
station, generally indicated at 254, comprising a bonding apparatus 255 for a second
bonding operation (broadly, a second securement) in which the webs 213, 205 of
absorbent material and base material are bonded (i.e., secured) together at the folded
portions thereof in order to secure the web of cover material in its folded configuration. In
one embodiment, the bonding apparatus 255 is an ultrasonic bonding apparatus that
ultrasonically bonds all of the layers of the folded portions of the web of cover material
together in a predetermined bond pattern 257. In one embodiment, illustrated in Fig. 49,
the bond pattern is a generally non-uniform bond pattern (i.e., not symmetric in the
machine direction and/or the transverse direction), such as the illustrated snail-shaped
bond pattern. In other embodiments, the bond pattern may be any suitable bond pattern.
For example, the bond pattern may be another suitable non-uniform bond pattern, or it
may be any suitable uniform bond pattern.
         [0201]    The bond pattern in one embodiment is sufficient to provide an adequate
number of bonds, or adequate bonded surface area, for each of the later-formed contact
members 162 (Fig. 28), e.g., formed by the slits 156 in the cover 138. In an embodiment,
the bond pattern may be sufficient to provide an equal number of point bonds, or an even
distribution of bonded surface area, over each of the later-formed contact elements 162.
In another embodiment, the bond pattern may provide an unequal number of point bonds,

or a non-uniform distribution of bonded surface area, over multiple later-formed contact
elements 162.
        [0202]    In an embodiment, this second bonding (i.e., second securement)
operation provides a bond having a bond strength that is greater than the bond strength
provided by the first bonding (i.e., first securement) operation. It is understood that the
bond strength can be controlled by pressure, energy, temperature, time and pattern used
in the bonding process. For example, in the illustrated embodiment the bond pattern
provided by this second bonding operation has a higher bond point density, and thus a
higher bonded surface area, than the bond pattern provided by the first bonding operation.
        [0203]    In an embodiment, as illustrated in Figs. 42 and 44, the securement
station 254 further comprises the additional bonding apparatus 261. In the illustrated
embodiment, the additional bonding apparatus 261 is also an ultrasonic bonding
apparatus and is operable to bond the folded portions of the web 239 of cover material at
a location that is at least in part different from the location at which the bond pattern 257 is
applied by the upstream bonding apparatus. More particularly, this bonding apparatus
261 bonds at least the folded portion of the web 205 of base material at which the
opposed layers of base material face each other without intervening absorbent material
therebetween. In one embodiment, as illustrated in Fig. 50, this additional bonding
apparatus 261 additionally bonds all of the layers of the folded portion of the web 239 of
cover material together generally along the inner side edges 245 of the respective webs
213a, 213b of absorbent material. This additional bonding operation securely encloses
the webs 213a, 213b of absorbent material within the folded web 205 of base material. It
is contemplated that the bonding apparatus 261 can be any suitable bonding apparatus
including, for example, a stitching or sewing apparatus.
        [0204]    In one embodiment, the bond pattern 263 produced by this additional
bonding operation is a uniform, generally sinusoidal (e.g., wave) bond pattern. In other
embodiments, the bond pattern 263 produced by this additional bonding operation may be
any suitable uniform or non-uniform bond pattern. For example, in one embodiment, the
bond pattern is an intermittent, offset stitch pattern to inhibit CD movement of the web as it
passes through the apparatus 200. The bond strength provided by this additional bonding
operation is also greater than the bond strength provided by the first bonding (i.e., first
securement) operation.

         [0205]   Downstream of the securement station 254, the folded and bonded web
239 of cover material is subsequently drawn through the slitter 271 which is operable to
slit the web of cover material into two discrete, side-by-side webs 239a, 239b of cover
material. For example, the web 239 of cover material may be slit along the transverse
mid-point of the web, transversely inward of each of the folded portions of the web. In
such an embodiment, each web 239a, 239b of cover material thus includes a folded
portion and an unfolded portion comprised only of the base material.
         [0206]   In the embodiment illustrated in Figs. 42 and 44, the webs 239a, 239b of
cover material are further drawn through the die cutter 273 or other suitable cutting
apparatus. The die cutter 273 is operable to cut slits in the folded portion of each of the
webs of cover material, such as to form the slits 156 and corresponding contact elements
162 of the embodiment of Fig. 28. In one suitable embodiment, the die cutter 273 may be
operable to cut the slits 96 in a pattern in which a set of equally spaced slits is cut into the
folded portions of the webs of cover material along a segment corresponding to the length
of cover material to be applied to a single pledget to form a single tampon, followed by a
relatively larger gap before the next set of equally spaced slits along a segment
corresponding to the next length of cover material to applied to another pledget to form
another tampon.
         [0207]   In another embodiment, which is illustrated in FIG. 41, the die cutter 273
may be operable to cut the slits 96 such that each slit is equally spaced in the folded
portions of the webs 239 of cover material along a segment P1 corresponding to the
length of cover material to be applied to a single pledget to form a single tampon, followed
by the next set of equally spaced slits along a segment P2 corresponding to the next
length of cover material to applied to another pledget to form another tampon. Thus, in
this embodiment, each tampon 10 has the same number of contact elements 196 and
each of the contact elements 196 has the same width W and the same length L1. In the
illustrated embodiment, for example, each of the tampons 10 formed from the web 239
would have seven complete (i.e., whole) contact elements 196. It is understood, however,
that number of contact elements 196 per tampon 10, the width W of each of the contact
elements, and length Li of each of the contact elements can differ. In yet another
embodiment, the die cutter 273 may be omitted from the apparatus 300. In such an
embodiment, the slits 96 can be formed in a later process as described in more detail
below.

         [0208]    In an embodiment, after passing the die cutter 273 (or the slitter 271 if the
die cutter is omitted) the webs 239a, 239b of cover material are wound onto respective
rolls (not shown) for subsequent transport to a tampon making apparatus where the webs
of cover material are each cut into discrete lengths of cover material and applied about the
circumference of an absorbent structure, such as a pledget 12, to form a tampon.
         [0209]    FIG. 51 schematically illustrates one suitable embodiment of an
apparatus, indicated generally at 400, for making the tampon 10. As seen in FIG. 51, a
web 490 (e.g., a web of material suitable for the fleece 30 of the tampon 10) is fed from a
suitable supply source (e.g., supply tub 492). In the illustrated embodiment, the web 490
(broadly, "a substrate") is fed from the supply tub 492 by a first web transfer device,
indicated generally at 402, to an assembly station, indicated generally at 404.
         [0210]    While the illustrated embodiment of the apparatus 400 shows the web
supply source as being the supply tub 492, it is understood that any suitable supply source
(e.g., a roll, a barrel) can be used. It is also understood that the web 490 can be formed
in-line. For example, the web 490 could be formed using any suitable web forming
technique, such as a carding line, and fed directly to the web transfer device (not shown)
upon its formation.
         [0211]    The first web transfer device (not shown) is adapted to draw the web 490
from the supply tub 492 at a predetermined rate (i.e., speed) and under a predetermined
amount of tension. Web tensioning can suitably be established via the use of
conventional tensioning devices (e.g., spindle friction, dancer roll, drive rolls, closed loop
tension feedback device, and the like). The first web transfer device 402 also aligns the
web 490 in the cross-machine direction (CD direction). In one suitable embodiment, the
first web transfer device 402 aligns the web 490 generally along a machine centerline. As
mentioned above, the web 490 is fed by the first web transfer device 402 to the assembly
station 404.
         [0212]    The transverse, or cross-direction position of the web 490 is established
by the position of the unwind equipment (e.g., roll, etc.). Conventional centering
components (e.g., shepherds, hooks, vertical idlers, and other suitable centering
components) may be used to maintain the transverse or CD position of the web 490
relative to the machine direction MD. In addition to guide rolls, other conventional web
handling components may be used to maintain the orientation and centering of the web as
it moves through the apparatus, such as guide trays and the like. Suitable web guides

and web guide controllers are commercially available, such as, the Fife web guiding
system.
         [0213]  At the assembly station 404, the web 490 is perforated in the cross
machine direction at predetermined intervals to define transverse lines of weakness 405 in
the web (FIG. 54). In one suitable embodiment, the assembly station 404 is configured to
perforate the web 490 to define the transverse line of weakness 405 approximately every
256 mm of web. That is, in one embodiment, the lines of weakness 405 are spaced apart
approximately every 256 mm along the length of the web 490. It is understood that the
lines of weakness 405 can be formed in other suitable ways besides perforating the web
490. For example, the lines of weakness 405 can be formed by embossing, scoring,
and/or combinations thereof. It is also understood that the lines of weakness 405 can be
spaced apart any suitable distance along the length of the web 490. The web 490 having
one of the lines of weakness 405 defined by a plurality of perforations is illustrated in FIG.
54
         [0214]  Simultaneously, a web (or multiple webs) 494 of suitable cover material is
provided from a suitable supply source (e.g., supply roll 496). In the illustrated
embodiment, the web 494 is fed from the supply roll 496 through a web guide device,
indicated generally at 406, to the assembly station 404. In one suitable embodiment, the
web 494 of cover material is fed in the machine direction and generally aligned with the
web 490 of fleece material. It is understood, however, that one or both of the webs 490,
494 can be fed to the apparatus 400 at any suitable angle including, for example, the
cross-section direction. While the illustrated embodiment of the apparatus 400 shows the
web supply source as being the supply roll 496, it is understood that any suitable supply
source (e.g., a tub, a barrel) can be used. It is also understood that the web 494 can be
formed in-line. For example, the web 494 could be formed using the apparatus and
methods described above.
         [0215]  As seen in FIG. 52, which is a cross-section taken transversely (i.e., in the
cross-machine direction) through the web 494, the web in one suitable embodiment
comprises a base web 498 and an absorbent web 408 carried by the base web. In the
illustrated embodiment, the base web 498 is a continuous web of material suitable for
covering the fleece 30 of the tampon 10. It is understood that the base web 498 can have

cleaning and/or wiping. The absorbent web 408 can be a continuous web or a

one end to the base web 498. Thus, the absorbent web 408 has a bonded end 410 and a
free end 412 spaced from the bonded end. The free end 412 of the absorbent web 408
can move (e.g., by pivoting the absorbent web about the bonded end 410) relative to the
base web 498. It is contemplated that in some embodiments the base web 498 and the
absorbent web 408 can be formed as a single, integrated web. It is also contemplated
that in some embodiments the absorbent web 408 can be bonded to the base web 498
through the full width (CD direction) of the absorbent web. It is further contemplated that
in other embodiments the absorbent web 408 can be free from bonding to the base web
498.
         [0216]   With reference now to FIG. 53, which is a fragmentary top view of the web
494, the absorbent web 408 has a plurality of slits 96, which are provided to form the
contact elements 88 of the tampon 10. As mentioned above, it is contemplated that other
components of the tampon 10 can have slits 96 for forming the contact elements 88 of the
tampon 10. It is also contemplated that the slits 96 can be preformed (i.e., formed before
web 494 is to be used as the supply roll 496) or formed during the manufacturing of the
tampon 10 as described in more detail below.
         [0217]   With reference again to FIG. 51, the second web transfer device 406 is
adapted to draw the web 494 from the supply roll 496 at a predetermined rate (i.e., speed)
and under a predetermined amount of tension. Web tensioning can suitably be
established via the use of conventional tensioning devices (not shown) (e.g., spindle
friction, dancer roll, drive rolls, closed loop tension feedback device, and the like). In one
suitable embodiment, a second web transfer device (not shown) is adapted to control the
wrinkling and/or to remove wrinkles present in one or both of the webs 494, 490. Web
tensioning also provides the appropriate strain match during the combining of the webs
490, 494.
         [0218]   It is also contemplated that the second web transfer device 406 can be
configured to detect splices or other defects in the web 494, to control/remove dust from
the web, and/or to inhibit static charges from building up in the web. The second web
transfer device 406 also aligns the web 494 in the cross-machine direction (CD direction).
In one suitable embodiment, the second web transfer device 406 aligns the web 494 with
the other web 490 (i.e., the web of fleece 30 material) generally along the machine
centerline.

          [0219]   The transverse, or cross-direction position of the web 494 is established
by the position of the unwind equipment (e.g., roll, etc.). Conventional centering
components (e.g., shepherds, hooks, vertical idlers, and other suitable centering
components) may be used to maintain the transverse or CD position of the web 494
relative to the machine direction MD. In addition to guide rolls, other conventional web
handling components may be used to maintain the orientation and centering of the web as
it moves through the apparatus, such as guide trays and the like. Suitable web guides
and web guide controllers are commercially available, such as, the Fife web guiding
system.
          [0220]   Thus, both of the webs 490, 494 are registered in both the MD and CD
direction. In other words, both of the webs 490, 494 are aligned relative to one or more
reference points. The one or more reference points can be a portion of the web 490, 494
itself, a portion of the other web, a component (or portion thereof) of the apparatus 400,
and/or combinations thereof. In one suitable embodiment, CD registration is ± 2mm and
MD registration is ± 3mm of the webs 490, 494 and can be measured by Photoeyes,
vision system, visual indicators, rulers, and other conventional measuring techniques.
          [0221]   As mentioned above, the web 494 of cover material is fed from the
second web transfer device (not shown) to the assembly station 404. At the assembly
station 404, the web 494 is cut or perforated in the cross-machine direction into discrete
web segments 414 having a predetermined length L (FIG. 54). In the illustrated
embodiment, for example, each of the web segments 414 have a length of approximately
 128 mm. It is understood that the web segments 414 can be cut into any suitable lengths.
          [0222]   During the cutting process, the absorbent web 408 of the web 494 is
controlled to ensure that it is cut properly along with the base web 494. In one suitable
embodiment, the absorbent web 408 is held against the base web 494 by a suitable hold
down device to maintain the absorbent web 408 in proper registration with the base web
494 as the web segments 414 are cut from the web 494. The hold down device can be,
for example, air-knife, vacuum covers, vacuum conveyor, ski, folding board, nip roll, fold
finger, surface coatings, and/or side vacuum assist. The hold down device in the form of a
vacuum conveyor 420 is illustrated in FIGS. 52 and 53. The illustrated vacuum conveyor
420 comprising a vacuum chamber 422 and a conveyor belt 424 having a plurality of
apertures 426 for allowing the vacuum to act on the web 494 (i.e., both the base web 494
and the absorbent web 408). The apertures are of appropriate size and distribution to act

effectively on each contact element if cut, or the pattern is registered in the MD and CD to
control the contact elements.
           [0223]   In the illustrated embodiment, the discrete web segments 414 are placed
on the perforated, continuous web 490 of fleece material at predetermined spaced
intervals. In one suitable embodiment, which is illustrated in FIG. 54, the web segments
414 are placed on the web 490 such that web segments extends over the lines of
weakness 405 formed in the web by a predetermined distance D1. It is understood, that
the web segments 414 can be placed on the web 490 in any suitable manner.
           [0224]   More specifically, the cutting and placing of segment 414 is mechanically
linked to the perforating of continuous web 490 to establish MD registration of the discrete
web segment, the continuous web and the slits 159, wherever they are applied. In one
suitable embodiment, the assembly station 404 may include a vision/closed loop
automated or manual phasing system to ensure that the MD registration of discrete web
segment 414, the continuous web 490 and the slits 159 is within a predetermined
tolerance. In one suitable embodiment, the tolerance of dimension D1 is within the range
of 25 mm and 31 mm and more suitably about 28 mm.
           [0225]   While still at the assembly station 404, each of the discrete web segments
414 is bonded (e.g., pressure bonded, thermal bonded, ultrasonically bonded, adhesively
bonded) to the web 490. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, each of the web
segments 414 is thermally bonded to the web 490. More specifically, the base web 494 of
each of the web segments 414 is thermally bonded to the web 490 while the absorbent
web 408 of each of the web segments is free from bonding.
           [0226]   In one suitable embodiment, which is illustrated in FIG. 55, the base web
494 of each of the segments 414 is thermally bonded to the web 490 by feeding the base
web 494 and the web 490, which is aligned with the base web, through a nip 434 defined
by a pair of spaced-part upper rolls 436 and a lower roll 438. The upper rolls 436 are
sufficiently spaced apart to allow the absorbent web 408 of each of the web segments 414
to pass between the upper rolls. While the lower roll 438 is illustrated as being a single
roll, it is understood that the lower roll could be formed as two separate spaced apart rolls
similar to the upper rolls 436.

         [0227]   As illustrated in FIG. 55, the assembly station 404 comprises an
absorbent web controller, indicated generally at 430, for positioning the absorbent web
408 such that the base web 494 can be suitably bonded to the web 490. In the illustrated
embodiment, for example, the absorbent web controller 430 comprises a pair of rods 432
for pivoting the absorbent web about its bonded end 410 to a generally perpendicular
position such that the free end 412 is spaced from the base web 494. It is contemplated
that the absorbent web controller 430 can be other suitable web controllers including, but
not limited to, proper tension, horizontal-straight-through webpaths, conveyors, vacuum
conveyors, vacuum rolls, roll to roll transfer, air-knifes, skis, rotating discs, nip rolls, fold
fingers, surface coatings, and/or side vacuum assist. Also is a requirement to control the
contact elements once cut to ensure they stay in their registered placement, are active
and able to open to the outside of the tampon and are undamaged. Any combination of
the web controlling items listed above would be employed after the contact elements are
cut in the web to maintain control throughout the process.
         [0228]   After the web segments 414 are bonded to the continuous web 490, a
secondary bond 473 can be added to bond the absorbent web 408 to the base web 498
(Fig. 54). In one suitable embodiment, the secondary bond 473 is limited to an area or a
portion of the area that will be overlapped in the soft roll forming process, which is
described in more detail below. In such an embodiment and as illustrated in Fig. 54, the
secondary bond 473 would be disposed on the trailing side of the line of weakness 405.
Thus, the secondary bond 473 should be sufficient to bond the absorbent web 408 to the
base web 498. However, the secondary bond 473 should not bond the base web 798 to
the underlying web 490. While the illustrated secondary bond 473 comprises point
bonding, it is understood that any suitable bonding technique can be used to bond the
absorbent web 408 to the base web 498.
         [0229]   In one suitable embodiment, the assembly station 404 further comprises
an inspection system (e.g., one or more photo eyes), indicated generally at 409 in FIG. 51,
adapted to inspect one or more of the following - the lines of weakness 405 formed in the
web 490 of fleece material, the cuts in the web 494 to form the discrete web segments
414, the placement of the web segments 414 on the web 490 of fleece material (e.g.,
cross-machine direction alignment, machine direction alignment) and the bonding of the
discrete web segments 414 to the web 490.

         [0230]   As mentioned above, the slits 96 in the absorbent web 408 of the discrete
web segments 414 can be preformed (i.e., formed before web 494 is used as the supply
roll 496) or formed during the manufacturing of the tampon 10. In an embodiment, the die
cutting module is mechanically linked to the perforating cutters of the fleece and cover
material and is phasable in order to maintain precise registration of the contact elements
cuts and/or dead zones to the edges of the other materials. This could also be done via
servo drives, phasing gearboxes, etc. In one suitable embodiment wherein the slits 96 are
formed during the manufacturing of the tampon 10, the web 490 having the discrete web
segments 414 bonded thereto is fed from the assembly station 404 to a die cutting station
440 adapted to cut slits 96 in absorbent web 408.
         [0231]   In one suitable embodiment, the die cutting station 440 includes an
absorbent web controller, indicated generally at 442, for positioning the absorbent web
408 such that the absorbent web can be suitably cut at the cutting station to form the slits
96. The die cutting station 440 is operable to cut slits in the folded portion of the web 494
of cover material, such as to form the slits 156 and corresponding contact elements 162 of
the embodiment of Fig. 28. In an embodiment, the die cutting station 440 may be
operable to cut the slits in a pattern in which a set of equally spaced slits is cut into the
folded portions of the web 494 of cover material along a segment corresponding to the
length of cover material to be applied to a single pledget to form a single tampon, followed
by a relatively larger gap before the next set of equally spaced slits along a segment
corresponding to the next length of cover material to applied to another pledget to form
another tampon.
         [0232]   In another embodiment, which is illustrated in FIG. 41, the die cutting
station 440 may be operable to cut the slits 156 such that each slit is equally spaced in the
folded portions of the web of cover material along a segment P1 corresponding to the
length of cover material to be applied to a single pledget to form a single tampon, followed
by the next set of equally spaced slits along a segment P2 corresponding to the next
length of cover material to applied to another pledget to form another tampon. Thus, in
this embodiment, each tampon 10 has the same number of contact elements 196 and
each of the contact elements 196 has the same width W and the same length L1. In the
illustrated embodiment, for example, each of the tampons 10 formed from the web 494
would have seven complete (i.e., whole) contact elements 196. It is understood, however,
that number of contact elements 196 per tampon 10, the width W of each of the contact
elements, and length Li of each of the contact elements can differ.

         [0233]    In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 56, the absorbent web controller 442
comprises a pair of support rods 444 for holding the absorbent web 408 in a generally
perpendicular position such that the free end 412 of the absorbent web is spaced from the
base web 494 and can be acted on a suitable cutting device (e.g., a knife roll 446 and
anvil roll 448 as illustrated in FIG. 56). It is contemplated that the absorbent web controller
442 can be other suitable web controllers including, but not limited to, proper tension,
horizontal-straight-through webpaths, conveyors, vacuum conveyors, vacuum rolls, roll to
roll transfer, air-knifes, skis, rotating discs, nip rolls, fold fingers, surface coatings, and/or
side vacuum assist. Also is a requirement to control the contact elements once cut to
ensure they stay in their registered placement, are active and able to open to the outside
of the tampon and are undamaged. Any combination of the web controlling items listed
above would be employed after the contact elements are cut in the web to maintain this
control throughout the process (especially through the stringing module and into the soft
winding station). The die cutting station can include a suitable inspection system (e.g.,
one or more photo eye) for ensuring that the slits 96 are properly cut in the absorbent web
408.
         [0234]    As seen in FIG. 51, the apparatus 400 comprises a withdrawal aid
placement station 500 having a suitable supply source 502 of a continuous supply of string
504 (or other suitable withdrawal aid material) suitable for use as the withdrawal aid 14 of
the tampon 10. As illustrated in FIG. 57, the string 502 can be cut and wrapped around
the web 490 at a predetermined located spaced from the discrete web segments 414.
More specifically, a cut portion 506 of the string 502 is wrapped around the web 490 at a
predetermined distance D2 from a leading edge of the web segment 414. In one suitable
embodiment, the distance D2 corresponding to the distance between the string 502 and
leading edge of the web segment 414 is approximately equal to the distance D1
corresponding to the distance between the line of weakness 405 formed in the web 490
and a trailing edge of the web segment. It is understood that the distances D1, D2 can be
different. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the string 504 can be located
approximately 170.7 mm forward from the trailing line of weakness 405. In other words,
the string 504 can be located at a location approximately two-thirds the distance between
adjacent leading and trailing lines of weakness 405. In other words, the string 504 is
registered in both the CD and MD directions.

         [0235]    As seen in FIG. 57, the cut portion 506 of the string 502 wrapped around
the web 490 extends beyond the web and is positioned such that both ends of the cut
portion are generally adjacent each other. The part of the cut portion 506 extending
beyond the web 490 is rolled and/or tied to form the knot 444 in the withdrawal aid 14 of
the tampon 10. In one suitable embodiment, an inspection system (e.g., one or more
photo eyes) is provided at the withdrawal aid placement station 500 to ensure, for
example, that the cut portion 506 of the string 502 is located properly relative to the web
segment 414 and/or that the knot 444 is properly formed.
         [0236]    After the part of the cut portion 506 extending beyond the web 490 is tied,
the web is conveyed by a ribbon transport device 510 (e.g., upper and lower spaghetti
conveyors) to a suitable winding and sealing device, indicated generally at 520. In the
embodiment illustrated in FIG. 51, the ribbon transport device 510 is a pair of opposed
conveyors. In one suitable embodiment, the opposed conveyors may employ metal
fingers to move the main ribbon. Suitably, the metal fingers of the opposed conveyors are
MD registered to inhibit damage to the contact elements. The winding and sealing device
520 is configured to separate the web 490 about the line of weakness 405 into individual
units as the web is being fed to the winding and sealing device. Each of the individual
units corresponds to a single tampon 10.
         [0237]    After being separated from the web 490, each of the units is manipulated
(e.g., rolled or folded) to form a softwind wherein the fleece material defines the core and
the cover overlies and covers the fleece material such as illustrated in Fig. 25. In this
embodiment, however, the cover is carrying the absorbent web 408 having the plurality of
slits 96, which are provided to form the contact elements 196 of the tampon 10.
         [0238]    As the soft wind process begins, a secondary absorbent tucker apparatus
(not shown) can be used to ensure the absorbent web 408 is tucked into a soft wind cup
and to maintain parallelism through the winding process without damaging the contact
elements 196. The wind process needs to be MD registered and timed to complete its
operation during the winder dwell time. As a result, predictable and repeatable angular
rotation of the softwind cups from loading through each dwell point through ejection is
required.
         [0239]    A cover to cover sealing device 522 is provided to seal the overlapping
portions of the web segments 414 (FIG. 51). More specifically, the portion of the base
web 494 defining the cover of the tampon 10 is overlapped upon itself and heat sealed

along the overlap. In one suitable embodiment, the overlap generally corresponds to the
distance D1 between the trailing edge of the web segment 414 and the line of weakness
405 formed in the web 490. It is understood, however, cover can be sealed using any
suitable technique and that the cover can have other suitable overlaps. It is also
understood that the cover can be free from overlap (e.g., when the cover is sealed end-to
end). Suitably, the seal is sufficient to withstand the further processing and use.
        [0240]    In one suitable embodiment, the cover to cover sealing device 522 can be
MD registered and timed to act during the soft wind dwell time. The cover-to-cover bond
of the web segment 414 can be a continuous bond pattern or several different bond points
acting with different patterns, pressures, and temperatures. This bond could also be
registered in to relation with the angular position of the winding forks in each winding cup.
Additionally, back pressure from the winding forks may be needed to ensure reliable seal.
        [0241]    Concentric ejecting and receiving transfer points aid in minimizing
damage and misalignment of the absorbent web 408 during transfer of the soft wind. It is
contemplated that the contact surfaces of the transfer points may be tapered, coated,
patterned to inhibit misalignment and damage of the absorbent web. These may be CD or
MD registered relative to the contact element locations, cover to cover sealing and
geometry features of the compressor.
        [0242]    As noted above, the individual units can also be stacked, folded or
otherwise manipulated into the softwind. For example, suitable menstrual tampons may
include "cup" shaped pledgets like those disclosed in U.S. Publication No. 2008/0287902
to Edgett and U.S. 2,330,257 to Bailey; "accordion" or "W-folded" pledgets like those

pledgets and "stacked" pledgets is disclosed in U.S. 2008/0132868 to Jorgensen.
         [0244]   The softwind is then pushed from the winding and sealing device 520 by a
suitable push rod (not shown) into a cup 528 of an articulating arm, indicated generally at
530 (FIG. 38). As illustrated in FIG. 51, the articulating arm 528 transport the softwind
from the winding and sealing device 520 to a compression station, indicated generally at
540. More specifically, a push rod (not shown) pushes the softwind from the cup 528 of
the articulating arm 530 into one of a plurality of mold cavities 542 formed in a compressor
of the compression station 540.
         [0245]   CD registration in the articulating arm 530 is established by eject arm
stroke length or stop points in the arm. The articulating arm 530 is used to bring the soft
wind from the winding and sealing device 520 to the compression station 540 in a
repeatable and predictable angular position. In order to achieve a desired angular
position, the articulating arm 530 may be capable of rotating the soft wind while
transferring it. This may be controlled by inspection stations before, during, and or after
transportation of the soft wind. Concentric ejecting and receiving transfer points aid in
minimizing the damage and misalignment of the absorbent web 408 during transfer of the
soft wind. Additionally, the contact surfaces of the transfer points may be tapered, coated,
patterned to prevent misalignment and damage and the absorbent web 408. The ejection
process (i.e., the process of removing the soft wind from the cup 528) is controlled to
register the soft wind in the CD in the articulating arm 530. Additionally, the articulating
arm 530 can be capable of rotating the soft wind 180 degrees to reverse the nose and
string end of the tampon.
         [0246]   During exit of the soft wind from the articulating arm 530 to one of mold
cavities of the compressor of the compressor station 540, CD registration is controlled by
the push length of the ejecting apparatus and/or stop points in the compressor. The
angular position of the soft wind (i.e., the position about the circumference of the soft wind)
established by the articulating arm 530 is maintained, such as, by guide rails as the soft
wind enters the compressor. The compressor geometry can be such that in the open
position there is oversized clearance or tapered, coated, patterned surfaces to protect the
absorbent web 408 during CD transport into the compressor. It is contemplated that the
ejecting apparatus can be adapted to rotate the soft wind in addition to or instead of the
articulating arm 530.

the absorbent web 408 including the contact elements. For example, the compressive
jaws can have a continuous pattern that varies in the CD direction and/or its annularity.
For example, the compressive can vary in actuation depth or can have relief (i.e., a cutout)
to accommodate the absorbent web 408 and, more particularly, the contact elements
during the compression of the soft wind. It is contemplated that the compressive jaws can
be arranged to act on the contact elements and/or slits in the absorbent web 108, can be
arranged not to act on the contact elements and/or slits, or a combination thereof.
        [0248]   In one suitable embodiment, when the softwind is positioned within one of
the mold cavities of the compression station 540, a plurality of dies moves towards one
another and compress the softwind. In some suitable embodiments, the compression
station 540 is adapted to apply heat to the softwind. The softwind can be compressed any
suitable amount. For example, the softwind may be compressed at least about 25%, 50%,
or 75% of the initial dimensions. For example, the softwind can be reduced in diameter to
approximately 1% of the original diameter. The cross-sectional configuration of the
resultant tampon 10 may be circular, ovular, rectangular, hexagonal, or any other suitable
shape.
        [0249]   The compressed soft wind (i.e., the pledget) exits the compressor of the
compression station 540 into one of a plurality of holding tubes. CD registration of the
pledget is controlled and the angular position of the pledget (i.e., the position about the
circumference of the pledget) established by the articulating arm 530 is maintained as the
pledget enters the respective holding tube.
        [0250]   A suitable nose forming apparatus (not shown) of the compression station
540 forms the nose of the pledget. Thus, the location of the pledget within the holding
tube must be concentric predictable, and repeatable. In one suitable embodiment, the
location of the pledget within the holding tube can be accomplished via mechanical
linkages.
        [0251]   Once formed, the tampons 10 are pushed from the mold cavities 542 of
the compression station 540 by a push rod (not shown) in to a suitable wrapper at a
wrapping and sealing station, indicated generally at 550, for sealing the tampons. The
wrapping and sealing station 550 is configured to wrap each of the tampons 10 in the
wrapper and to seal the wrapped. After the tampons 10 are wrapped and sealed in the

                                                 79

wrapper at the wrapping and sealing station 550, the tampons can be packaged for sale
(i.e., placed in boxes suitable for sale to consumers). It is contemplated that the tampons
 10 can be placed into suitable applicators (not shown) prior to being wrapped and sealed
at the wrapping and sealing station 550.
         [0252]   During the transfer of the softwind from the winding and sealing device
520 to the cup 528 of an articulating arm 530 (which is illustrated in FIG. 58) and/or the
transfer of the softwind from the cup of the articulating arm into one of the plurality of mold
cavities 542 formed in the compression station 540, a transfer assist device, indicated
generally at 560 in FIG. 58, facilitates the transferring for the softwind while maintaining
the proper positioning of the portion of the absorbent web 408 forming the softwind relative
to the portion of the base web 494 forming the softwind. In one suitable embodiment, the
transfer assist device 560 is a tapered guide 562 adapted to direct the tampon 10 into the
cup 528 or the respective mold cavity 542 (the cup 528 being seen in FIG. 58). More
specifically, the tapered guide 562 is adapted to direct the free end 412 or bonded end
410 (depending on the direction the softwind is being pushed and the direction in which
the free end and bonded end are oriented) into the cup 528 or respective mold cavity 542
while inhibiting the portion of the absorbent web 408 forming the softwind from becoming
misaligned (e.g., wrinkled, creased, folded) with respect to the portion of the base web 494
forming the softwind. It is understood that the transfer assist device 560 can be other
types of suitable devices including, for example, an air-knife, vacuum covers, vacuum
conveyor, ski, folding board, nip roll, fold finger, surface coatings, and/or side vacuum
assist.
         [0253]   It is contemplated that once the contact elements are formed in the web of
cover material, air flow (e.g., shielding, hold down devices, deflectors, vacuum) can be
used to avoid disruption of the contact elements as the web of cover material is moving
through the process. It is also contemplated that static energy and humidity can be
controlled through all or portions of the process. Static energy, for example, can be
controlled using de-ionizing bars, static eliminators, grounding "tinsels," or other suitable
grounding techniques.
         [0254]   In the interests of brevity and conciseness, any ranges of values set forth
in this disclosure contemplate all values within the range and are to be construed as
support for claims reciting any sub-ranges having endpoints which are whole number
values within the specified range in question. By way of hypothetical example, a

         [0255]   The dimensions and values disclosed herein are not to be understood as
being strictly limited to the exact numerical values recited. Instead, unless otherwise
specified, each such dimension is intended to mean both the recited value and a
functionally equivalent range surrounding that value. For example, a dimension disclosed
as "40mm" is intended to mean "about 40 mm."
