            A DUST COLLECTING DEVICE AND METHOD OF USE THEREOF
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]      The present invention relates to a dust collecting device for use in longwall coal
mining and a method of use thereof.
BACKGROUND
[0002]      Coal dust is an unavoidable side product of underground coal mining.        Dust is
generally produced at the face of a seam of coal, at conveyors, at transfer points and by the
normal movement of workers and machines, such as, e.g., hydraulically powered roof supports
used in longwall coal mining operations.
[0003]      Typically, coarse coal dust particles will settle rapidly. However, fine coal dust
particles remain airborne much longer, and can be circulated by ventilating air relatively long
distances before they settle.
[0004]      A problem in general with underground coal mining operations, such as, e.g.,
longwall coal mining, is the production of fine coal dust or float coal dust, which is highly
explosive and susceptible to spontaneous combustion.        Indeed, some of the worst mining
accidents in history have been caused by coal dust explosions.
[0005]      Another problem associated with the production of fine coal dust or float coal dust
is Coal workers'      pneumoconiosis,  also known as black lung disease. Coal workers'
pneumoconiosis is caused by the prolonged inhalation of coal dust.          Inhaled coal dust
progressively builds up in the lungs and cannot be removed by the body; this leads to
inflammation, fibrosis, and in worse cases, necrosis.
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
[0006]      Embodiments of the present invention provide a dust collecting device and method
of use thereof, which may at least partially overcome at least one of the abovementioned
problems or provide the consumer with a useful or commercial choice.
[0007]      According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a dust
collecting device for use with or when used with at least one roof support in a longwall coal
mine, said device including:

                                                     2
              a channel having a base and a pair of opposed sidewalls extending upwardly from
the base; and
              at least one fastener for fastening the channel to the at least one roof support for
collecting dust that falls past a roof canopy of the at least one roof support.
[0008]       According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a roof
support for use in a longwall coal mine, said support including the dust collecting device of the
first aspect for, in use, collecting dust that falls past a roof canopy of the roof support.
[0009]       Advantageously, the dust collecting device of the present invention provides a
means for collecting coal dust that falls past a canopy of a roof support used in longwall coal
mining operations and directing the harmful coal dust away from a ventilation pathway.
Consequently, the device, when attached to a roof support, provides a safer working
environment for longwall coal miners. Moreover, the device, by way of its construction, can be
readily retrofitted to existing roof supports and also incorporated into newly constructed roof
supports.
[0010]       A longwall coal mining operation generally includes a number of hydraulically
powered roof supports arranged in parallel across a face of an underground coal seam.
[0011]       Usually, a machine called a shearer or plough is positioned between the seam and
the roof supports and is carried back and forth across the face of the coal seam by an armoured
face conveyor (AFC) to cut coal from the seam. The cut coal is typically loaded onto the AFC
for removal from the face.
[0012]        When coal is removed, the AFC and powered roof supports sequentially advance
forward into the newly created cavity vacating the cavity behind the roof supports, also known
as the goaf. As mining progresses through the seam, the goaf increases and is allowed to
collapse in a planned and controlled manner under the weight of overlying strata.
[0013]        Each powered roof support typically includes a roof canopy having a forward edge,
an opposed rear edge and opposed longitudinal side edges; at least one floor engaging base; and
at least two hydraulic legs extending between the canopy and the at least one base.
[0014]        The canopy and the at least one base are typically interconnected via a goaf shield
and lemniscate linkages extending between the rear edge of the canopy and a rear portion of the
at least one base.

                                                   3
[0015]       In some embodiments, side shields may be mounted to each longitudinal side edge
of the canopy and may extend at least partially along the side edge, preferably along the entire
side edge. In some embodiments, side shield may further extend along a side edge of the goaf
shield to the lemniscate linkages.
[0016]       As indicated above, the dust collecting device of the present invention is configured
to be fastened to at least one roof support for collecting coal dust that falls past the roof canopy
of the at least one roof support.
[0017]       The device may be fastened in any suitable location on the roof support to collect
the dust. Typically, however, the device may be fastened to an edge of the roof canopy of the at
least one roof support.
[0018]       For example, in some embodiments, the device may be fastened to the rear edge of
the canopy to collect dust that may fall between the canopy and the goaf shield.
[0019]       In other embodiments, the device may be fastened to a side edge of the canopy to
collect dust that may fall between adjacently positioned roof supports or between the side edge
of the canopy and a side shield, preferably the latter.
[0020]       The device may be of any suitable size, shape and construction and formed from
any suitable material or materials. The device may be of unitary construction or may be formed
from two or more device pieces, preferably the latter.
[0021]       Generally, the device may be formed from durable material or materials, such as,
e.g., metals, plastic and/or rubber materials. Typically, the device may be formed from metal
materials, such as, e.g., steel, aluminium, titanium or any alloy thereof, and/or plastic material.
[0022]       As indicated, the device includes a channel defined by a base and a pair of opposed
sidewalls extending upwardly from the base, preferably from opposed longitudinal side edges
of the base.
[0023]       The channel may be of any suitable size, shape and construction.
[0024]       The channel may preferably be an extrusion formed from metal or a metal alloy,
such as, e.g., steel, aluminium or titanium.
[0025]       The channel may be of any desired length and width. Generally, the channel may

                                                 4
be sized and shaped to extend at least partially along an edge of the canopy of the at least one
roof support, preferably a side edge.
[0026]      For example, the channel may have a width extending between an outer edge of
each of the opposed sidewalls of at least of at least 35mm, at least 40mm, at least 45mm, at
least 50mm, at least 55mm, at least 60mm, at least 65mm, at least 70mm, at least 75mm, at least
80mm, at least 85mm, at least 90mm, at least 95mm, at least 100mm, at least 105mm, at least
110mm, at least 115mm, at least 120mm, at least 125mm, at least 130mm, at least 135mm, at
least 140mm, at least 145mm, at least 150mm, at least 155mm, at least 160mm, at least 165mm,
at least 170mm, at least 175mm, at least 180mm, at least 185mm, at least 190mm, at least
195mm, at least 200mm, at least 205mm, at least 210mm, at least 215mm, at least 220mm, at
least 225mm, at least 230mm, at least 235mm, at least 240mm, at least 245mm, at least 250mm,
at least 255mm, at least 260mm, at least 265mm, at least 270mm, at least 275mm, at least
280mm, at least 285mm, at least 290mm, at least 295mm or at least 300mm.
[0027]      In some embodiments, the channel may be provided in one or more standard lengths
configured to, e.g., extend along a side edge of a canopy of a commonly used roof support. For
example, the channel may be provided in standard lengths of at least 1,500mm, at least
2,000mm, at least 2,500mm, at least 3,000mm, at least 3,500mm, at least 4,000mm, at least
4,500mm or at least 5,000mm.
[0028]      In other embodiments, the channel may be formed to a desired length.
[0029]      The channel may generally have opposed ends. The ends may be open or closed,
preferably open.
[0030]      The base of the channel may have a substantially rectangular shape, including an
upper surface, an opposed lower surface, opposed end edges and the opposed longitudinal side
edges.
[0031]      In some embodiments, the base may be curved. For example, the base may include
a concave upward curve extending between the opposed longitudinal side edges.           In such
embodiments, the channel may have a substantially U-shaped cross sectional shape.
[0032]      Each sidewall may extend upwardly from a longitudinal side edge of the base to a
rim. The rim may extend from an upper edge portion of the sidewall along an upper edge of the
sidewall.

                                                 5
[0033]       In some embodiments, the rim may be an outwardly-rolled rim. The outwardly
rolled rim may extend at least partially along the upper edge of one or both sidewalls,
preferably both. The outwardly-rolled rim may include a rolled portion that extends outwardly
to a lip. The rolled portion may be defined by a constant or uniformly changing radius or some
other suitable curve.
[0034]       Each sidewall may include an inner surface and an opposed outer surface.
[0035]       The sidewalls may extend upwardly from the base at any angle relative to the base
and to any height suitably adapted to define the channel for collecting coal dust falling past the
canopy of the at least one roof support, preferably past a side edge of the canopy of the at least
one roof support.
[0036]       Typically, the sidewalls may extend orthogonally upwards from the base or at an
obtuse angle, such as, e.g., from about 900 to about 150' relative to the base. Preferably, the
sidewalls may extend upwardly from the opposed longitudinal side edges of the base at an
obtuse angle relative to the base.
[0037]       Each sidewall may extend upwards to a height of at least 50mm, at least 55mm, at
least 60mm, at least 65mm, at least 70mm, at least 75mm, at least 80mm, at least 85mm, at least
90mm, at least 95mm, at least 100mm, at least 105mm, at least 110mm, at least 115mm, at least
120mm, at least 125mm, at least 130mm, at least 135mm, at least 140mm, at least 145mm, at
least 150mm, at least 155mm, at least 160mm, at least 165mm, at least 170mm, at least 175mm,
at least 180mm, at least 185mm, at least 190mm, at least 195mm or at least 200mm from the
longitudinal side edge of the base to the rim.
[0038]       The sidewalls of the channel may extend upwardly from the base to a same height
or differing heights.
[0039]       In some embodiments, the height of each sidewall may vary between ends of the
channel to define a graded channel to facilitate the passage of dust towards a lower end when
fastened to the at least one roof support.     For example, in one such embodiment, when the
channel is fastened between the side edge of the canopy and a side shield, the sidewalls of the
channel may have a greater height at the end of the channel adjacent the goaf shield to form a
fall or negative gradient towards the goaf.
[0040]       As indicated above, the device includes at least one fastener for fastening the

                                                   6
channel to the at least one roof support, preferably at least two fasteners. The channel may be
directly or indirectly fastened to the at least one roof support.
[0041]       The at least one fastener may be of any suitable size, shape and form.
[0042]       For example, in some embodiments, the at least one fastener may include one or
more mechanical fasteners and/or one or more chemical fasteners.
[0043]       In one such embodiment, upper portions of the sidewalls of the channel may be
respectively fastened to a side edge of the canopy and an upper edge or portion of an adjacently
mounted side shield by one or more chemical fasteners. For example, the one or more chemical
fasteners including a wet adhesive, a dry adhesive and/or double-sided adhesive tape may
extend between the upper portions of the sidewalls and the side edge of the canopy and the
upper edge or portion of the adjacently mounted side shield, respectively.
[0044]       In another such embodiment, the upper portions of the sidewall may be respectively
fastened to the side edge of the canopy and the upper edge or portion of the side shield by one
or more mechanical fasteners.        For example, one or more threaded fasteners may extend
through respective openings defined in the upper portions of the sidewalls of the channel and
within openings defined in the side edge of the canopy and the upper edge or portion of the side
shield, respectively.
[0045]       In other embodiments, the channel may be fastened between a side edge of the
canopy and the upper edge or portion of side shield by way of one or more loops, straps or
bands, for example.
[0046]       In one such embodiment, a loop, strap or band may extend from respective
locations at or near the side edge of the canopy and the upper edge or portion of the side shield
and be coupled to, looped under or hooked underneath at least a portion or part of the channel.
[0047]       In another such embodiment, a first loop, strap or band may extend from a location
at or near the side edge of the canopy and be coupled to or looped through a respective opening
defined in an adjacent sidewall of the channel. Likewise, a second loop, strap or band may
extend from a location at or near the upper edge or portion of the side shield and be coupled to
or looped through a respective opening defined in an adjacent sidewall of the channel.
[0048]       In some embodiments, the at least one fastener may include a connecting

                                                 7
mechanism or part of a connecting mechanism for fastening the channel to a side edge of the
canopy and/or an upper edge or portion of the side shield. The connecting mechanism or part
of the connecting mechanism may be of integral formation with the channel.
[0049]       The connecting mechanism may include mateable male and female portions that
couple together, such as, e.g., a threaded connection, an interference fit (snap fit) connection, a
bayonet-type connection, or a hoop-and-loop type connection.
[0050]       For example, in one such embodiment, each sidewall of the channel may include at
least one male formation associated with the rim of the sidewall configured to be at least
partially inserted into or coupled to at least one female formation respectively associated with
each of the side edge of the canopy and the upper edge or portion of the side shield.
Conversely, the connecting mechanism may include at least one female formation associated
with the rim of each sidewall and configured to at least partially receive or be coupled with at
least one male formation respectively associated with each of the side edge of the canopy and
the upper edge or portion of the side shield.
[0051]       In another such embodiment, the sidewalls may each include a female formation in
the form of an outwardly-rolled rim as described above and the side edge of the canopy and the
upper edge or portion of the adjacently mounted side shield may each include a male formation
in the form of a ridge or protrusion extending upwardly from the side edge of the canopy and
the upper edge or portion of the side shield. Each outwardly-rolled rim may at least partially
receive or be coupled with a corresponding ridge or protrusion to respectively connect the
channel to the side edge of the canopy and the upper edge or portion of the side shield.
[0052]       In preferred embodiments, the device may further include a pair of connecting walls
each extending outwardly from the rim of a sidewall of the channel.
[0053]       Preferably, the channel may be fastened between the side edge of the canopy and
the side shield of the at least one roof support by the pair of connecting walls, which may
respectively be fastened to the side edge of the canopy and the side shield each by at least one
fastener.
[0054]       Each connecting wall may include an inner surface, an opposed outer surface, a
lower edge, an opposed upper edge and opposed side edges.
[0055]       Each connecting wall may typically be formed from a flexible and durable material

                                                  8
or materials, preferably a plastic material. Preferably, at least a surface of the plastic material
forming the inner surface of each connecting wall may be substantially smooth to facilitate coal
dust falling on the inner surface in being directed into the channel.
[0056]       In some embodiments, each connecting wall may include a strip, lining or coating
extending at least partially along the inner surface. The strip, lining or coating may preferably
be slippery to assist in directing coal dust into the channel. The strip, lining or coating may be
formed from a slippery material, preferably having a low coefficient of friction, such as e.g., a
smooth surface plastic.
[0057]       The connecting walls may typically be of the same length as the channel.
[0058]       The connecting walls may each be of any suitable height (extending between the
lower edge and the upper edge) such that the channel is, in use, suspended between the side
edge of the canopy and the side shield of the at least one roof support.
[0059]       Each connecting wall may have a height extending between its lower and upper
edges of at least 50mm, at least 55mm, at least 60mm, at least 65mm, at least 70mm, at least
75mm, at least 80mm, at least 85mm, at least 90mm, at least 95mm, at least 100mm, at least
105mm, at least 110mm, at least 115mm, at least 120mm, at least 125mm, at least 130mm, at
least 135mm, at least 140mm, at least 145mm, at least 150mm, at least 155mm, at least 160mm,
at least 165mm, at least 170mm, at least 175mm, at least 180mm, at least 185mm, at least
190mm, at least 195mm, at least 200mm, at least 205mm, at least 210mm, at least 215mm, at
least 220mm, at least 225mm, at least 230mm, at least 235mm, at least 240mm, at least 245mm,
at least 250mm, at least 255mm, at least 260mm, at least 265mm, at least 270mm, at least
275mm, at least 280mm, at least 285mm, at least 290mm, at least 295mm, at least 300mm, at
least 305mm, at least 310mm, at least 315mm, at least 320mm, at least 325mm, at least
330mm, at least 335mm, at least 340mm, at least 345mm, at least 350mm, at least 355mm, at
least 360mm, at least 365mm, at least 370mm, at least 375mm, at least 380mm, at least 385mm,
at least 395mm, at least 400mm, at least 405mm, at least 410mm, at least 415mm, at least
420mm, at least 425mm, at least 430mm, at least 435mm, at least 440mm, at least 445mm, at
least 450mm, at least 455mm, at least 460mm, at least 465mm, at least 470mm, at least 475mm,
at least 480mm, at least 485mm, at least 490mm, at least 495mm or at least 500mm.
[0060]       As described previously with regard to the sidewalls of the channel, in some
embodiments, the heights of the connecting walls may also vary between ends of the channel to

                                                 9
define a graded channel to facilitate in the passage of dust towards a lower end when fastened
to the at least one roof support. For example, in one such embodiment, when fastened between
the side edge of the canopy and the side shield, the connecting walls may have a greater height
at the end of the channel adjacent the goaf shield to form a fall or negative gradient towards the
goaf.
[0061]       Each connecting wall may be connected via its lower edge to the rim of a sidewall.
Each connecting wall and sidewall may be connected in any suitable way.
[0062]       For example, in some embodiments, a connecting wall and a sidewall may be
fastened together by one or more mechanical fasteners and/or one or more chemical fasteners.
[0063]       The lower edge of the connecting wall may be fastened to the rim of the sidewall by
one or more chemical fasteners as previously described.
[0064]       Conversely, the lower edge of the connecting wall may be fastened to the rim of the
sidewall by one or more mechanical fasteners as previously described.
[0065]       In other embodiments, the connecting wall and the sidewall may be connected
together by a connecting mechanism as described above.           For example, a first part of the
connecting mechanism may be associated with the lower edge portion of the connecting wall
and a second part of the connecting mechanism may be associated with the rim portion of the
sidewall.
[0066]       In one such embodiment, the connecting mechanism may include a hook-and-loop
type connection. The hooks part of the connection may be associated with one of the lower
edge portion of the connecting wall and the rim portion of the sidewall and the loops part of the
connection may be associated with the other of the lower edge portion of the connecting wall
and the rim portion of the sidewall.
[0067]       In other embodiments, the connecting wall and the sidewall may be pivotally
coupled or connected together.
[0068]       For example, in one such embodiment the lower edge portion of the connecting wall
may be folded back on itself and fastened to an adjacent portion of the connecting wall to
define a loop or fold through which a pivot pin may be received and be coupled or connected at
each pivot pin end to the rim of the sidewall. Preferably, the rim of the sidewall may be an

                                                   10
outwardly rolled rim as described above and the pivot pin may be at least partially received
within the rolled portion and coupled or fastened at each pivot pin end by one or more
mechanical fasteners to a protruding rim end portion extending at least partially over each end
of the rolled portion.
[0069]       As indicated above, the channel may be fastened between the side edge of the
canopy and the side shield of the at least one roof support by the pair of connecting walls,
preferably via an upper edge portion, which may respectively be fastened to the side edge of the
canopy and the side shield by the at least one fastener. Advantageously, the pair of connecting
walls may allow the channel to be suspended between the side edge of the canopy and the side
shield to collect any coal dust that falls therebetween.
[0070]       The upper edges of the connecting walls may be respectively fastened to the side
edge of the canopy and the side shield of the at least one roof support in any suitable way,
preferably detachably.
[0071]       For example, in some embodiments, the at least one fastener may include one or
more mechanical fasteners and/or one or more chemical fasteners.
[0072]       In one such embodiment, the upper edges of the connecting walls may be
respectively fastened to a side edge of the canopy and an upper edge or portion of the
adjacently mounted side shield by one or more chemical fasteners as previously described.
[0073]       In another such embodiment, the upper edges of the connecting walls may be

[00103]     As shown, the channel (110) is an extrusion formed from steel and/or aluminium.
The channel (110) has open opposed ends (112) and it typically formed to a length to extend
entirely along the longitudinal side edge of the canopy (250; shown only in Figure 2) of a roof
support (800; shown only in Figure 2) from a location at or near a forward edge of the canopy
(250; shown only in Figure 2) to the lemniscate linkages connecting the canopy (250; shown
only in Figure 2) and goaf shield of the roof support (800; shown only in Figure 2) to the floor
engaging base of the roof support (800; shown only in Figure 2).
[00104]      The channel (110) can be of any desired length and width.
[00105]      The base (120) of the channel (110) has a substantially rectangular shape and
includes an upper surface (122), an opposed lower surface (124; visible in Figure 2), opposed
end edges (126) and opposed longitudinal side edges (128).

                                                 15
[00106]      Each sidewall (130) of the channel (110) extends upwards from a longitudinal side
edge (128) of the base (120) to the rim (134) and includes an inner surface (136), an opposed
outer surface (138; visible only in Figure 2), a lower edge (132), the rim (134) and opposed side
edges.
[00107]      The rim (134) extends from an upper edge portion of each sidewall (130) and along
an upper edge of each sidewall (130).
[00108]      The rim (134) is an outwardly-rolled rim, which extends entirely along the upper
edge of each sidewall (130).     The outwardly-rolled rim includes a rolled portion (135) that
extends outwardly to a lip.
[00109]      The sidewalls (130) extend upwardly from the base (120) to the rim (134) at an
obtuse angle relative to the base (120) and to a height suitably adapted to define the channel
(110) for collecting coal dust.
[00110]      As also shown, the pair of connecting walls (140) each extending outwardly from a
rim (134) of a sidewall (130) of the channel (110) to an upper edge (142).
[00111]      Each connecting wall (140) includes an inner surface (146), an opposed outer
surface (148; only visible in Figure 2), a lower edge (144), the upper edge (142) and opposed
side edges. Each connecting wall (140) is formed from durable and flexible plastic material.
[00112]      Each connecting wall (140) is of the same length as the channel (110) and is of any
suitable height such that, when fastened to the roof support, the channel (110) is suspended
between the side edge of the canopy (250; shown only in Figure 2) and the side shield (260;
shown only in Figure 2) of the roof support (800; shown only in Figure 2).
[00113]      Each connecting wall (140) is pivotally connected to the rim (134) of the sidewall
(130) of the channel (110) via the lower edge (144) of the connecting wall (140) such that it
can, in use, pivot up and down relative to the channel (110).
[00114]      Each connecting wall (140) is pivotally connected to a rim (134) of a sidewall (130)
of the channel (110) by a pivot pin received in a fold formed by a lower edge portion of the
connecting wall (140) being folded back on itself and fastened to an adjacent portion of the
connecting wall (140). The pivot pin is at least partially received in the rolled portion (135) of
the rim (134) of the sidewall (130) and fastened at each end by a mechanical fastener (e.g., a

                                                 16
threaded fastener) received through a protruding rim end portion (139) extending at least
partially over each end of the rolled portion (135).
[00115]      Referring to Figure 2, the upper edges (142) of the connecting walls (140) of the
device (100) are respectively fastened, each by at least one fastener, to the side edge of the
canopy (250) and the side shield (260) of the roof support (800) such that the channel (110) is
suspended between the side edge of the canopy (250) and the side shield (260) to collect coal
dust that falls therebetween.
[00116]      Each upper edge (142) can be fastened to one of the side edge of the canopy (250)
and the side shield (260) of the roof support (800) with cable ties (160) and/or magnets (170).
[00117]      For example, a plurality of eyelets (149; best shown in Figure 1) are spaced along
each upper edge (142) of the connecting walls (140) for each receiving a cable tie (160) for
wrapping, looping or connecting around a portion or part of the of the canopy (250) and/or side
shield (260) for connecting the device (100) to the roof support (800).
[00118]      Likewise, a plurality of the magnets (170) also are spaced along each upper edge
(142) of the connecting walls (140) to magnetically couple to a portion or part of the canopy
(250) or the side shield (260) of the roof support (800) for fastening the device (100) to the roof
support (800).
[00119]      A method of at least partially reducing airborne coal dust in a longwall coal mine
using the coal dust collecting device (100) of the present invention is now described in detail
with reference to at least Figure 2.
[00120]      The method includes fastening the device (100) to a side edge of the canopy (250)
of the roof support (800) and the adjacent side shield (260) such that the channel (110) of the
device (100) is suspended between the canopy (250) and the side shield (260) to collect coal
dust falling therebetween.
[00121]      The device (100) is fastened to the side edge of the canopy (250) of the roof support
(800) and the adjacent side shield (260) by inserting cable ties (160) in one or more of the
eyelets (149) defined along the upper edge (142) of each connecting wall (140) and wrapping,
looping or connecting each cable tie (160) around a portion or part of the of the canopy (250)
and/or side shield (260) of the roof support (800).

                                                 17
[00122]      The device (100) is optionally further fastened to the side edge of the canopy (250)
of the roof support (800) and the adjacent side shield (260) by placing one or more magnets
(170) against an outer surface (148) of each connecting wall (140) to magnetically couple
through the connecting wall (140) with a portion or part of the of the canopy (250) and/or side
shield (260) of the roof support (800).
[00123]      Generally, the device (100) is fastened to the roof support (800) to provide a
negative gradient towards the end of the channel (110) nearest the goaf of the longwall coal
mine. By having a negative gradient, coal dust collected in the channel (110) is directed away
from a ventilation pathway of the longwall coal mine into the goaf.
