core comprises from 5 to 90 weight percent structural units of a fluoroalkylated monomer, and 2)
less than 0.09 weight percent structural units of a phosphorus acid monomer; and wherein the shell
comprises from 0.1 to 5 weight percent of itaconic acid or a phosphorus acid monomer, based on the
weight of the shell. The present invention addresses a need in the art by providing a way of
selectively concentrating fluoroalkyl functionality into polymer particles with acorn morphology,

Aqueous Dispersion of Fluoralkylated Polymer Particles with Acorn Morphology
Background of the Invention
[0001]     The present invention relates to an aqueous dispersion of fluoroalkylated polymer particles
with acorn morphology.
[0002]     Aqueous dispersions of polymer particles functionalized with fluoroalkyl groups
(fluoroalkylated latexes) are used in coatings formulations due to their differentiated performance
relative to traditional non-fluorinated hydrocarbon-based polymers. The inclusion of fluorinated
functionality is often desirable in coatings applications where soil resistance, stain resistance,
durability, and/or weatherability are sought after performance properties. One of the primary
drawbacks to using fluoroalkylated latexes is the significant cost premium relative to their
hydrocarbon counterparts. Accordingly, it would be an advantage in the field of coatings to find a
polymer capable of delivering improved stain resistance more efficiently.
Summary of the Invention
[0003]     The present invention addresses a need in the art by providing a composition comprising
1) an aqueous dispersion of polymer particles having a particle size as measured by dynamic light
scattering in the range of from 40 nm to 300 nm, wherein the polymer particles have a core-shell
morphology wherein the core protuberates from the shell; wherein the core comprises from 5 to 90
weight percent structural units of a fluoroalkylated monomer, and 2) less than 0.09 weight percent
structural units of a phosphorus acid monomer, based on the weight of the core; and wherein the
shell comprises from 0.1 to 5 weight percent of itaconic acid or a phosphorus acid monomer, based
on the weight of the shell; wherein the weight-to-weight ratio of the shell to the core is in the range
of from 3:1 to 50:1. The present invention addresses a need in the art by providing a way of
selectively concentrating fluoroalkyl functionality into polymer particles with acorn morphology.

                                                                 OH
where R is H or
                                               0
wherein the dotted line represents the point of attachment to the oxygen atom.
[0016]     The shell also preferably comprises from 0.1, more preferably from 0.5, and most

[0018]     In a preferred method of making the aqueous dispersions of polymer particles, a first
monomer emulsion is advantageously prepared by contacting water, butyl acrylate, methyl
                                                    5

methacrylate or styrene, allyl methacrylate, 2,2,2,-trifluoroethyl methacrylate, sodium
4-vinylbenzenesulfonate, and methacrylic acid under emulsion polymerization conditions to form a
precursor to the protuberating core. The precursor to the protuberating core (the preform) is isolated
and characterized. Then, water, the precursor, and a monomer emulsion of butyl acrylate, methyl
methacrylate, methacrylic acid, sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate and optionally a phosphorus acid
monomer are reacted in a separate and distinct step from the polymerization of the precursor under
emulsion polymerization conditions to form the stable aqueous dispersion of polymer particles with
acorn morphology.
[0019]      In another preferred method of making the aqueous dispersion, the polymer particles are
made via an two-stage approach where a first monomer emulsion is advantageously prepared by
contacting water, butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate or styrene, allyl methacrylate,
2,2,2,-trifluoroethyl methacrylate, sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate, and methacrylic acid under
emulsion polymerization conditions to form a dispersion of polymer particles. In the same reactor,
the dispersion of polymer particles is then reacted with a second monomer emulsion of butyl
acrylate, methyl methacrylate, methacrylic acid, sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate and optionally a
phosphorus acid monomer under emulsion polymerization conditions to form the stable aqueous
dispersion of polymer particles with acorn morphology.
[0020]      The composition may include other ingredients selected from the group consisting of
dispersants, pigments, defoamers, surfactants, solvents, additional binders, extenders, coalescents,
biocides, opaque polymers, and colorants. It has been discovered that coatings from paints
formulated using acorn type latex particles having fluorinated alkyl functionality in the core of the
acorn shows marked improvement in block resistance as compared with acorn latexes that are not so
functionalized.

[0024]      To a 5-L, four necked round bottom flask equipped with a paddle stirrer, a thermometer,
nitrogen inlet, and a reflux condenser was added deionized water (600 g) and Disponil FES 32
surfactant (21.3 g, 30% active). The contents of the flask were heated to 85 'C under N2 and stirring

monomer emulsion and a solution containing ammonium persulfate (1.7 g) and ammonium
hydroxide (2 g, 29% active) dissolved in deionized water (60 g), were each added linearly and

second monomer emulsion 30 min into the feed of the second monomer emulsion, followed by a
rinse of deionized water (25 g).
[0030]     The contents of the flask were maintained at a temperature of 84 'C during the addition of
the second monomer emulsion. When all additions were complete, the vessel containing the second

Dirt Pick up Resistance
[0046]    The paints were drawn down using a 7-mil plastic applicator on treated aluminum panels
and dried overnight in the CTR (25 'C, 50% R.H.). Next, the panels were placed outside facing
southward direction at a 450 angle tilt (South 45) for 6 d, after which time initial (pre-exposed) Y
reflectance of paints was measured. Next, the iron oxide dirt slurry was applied using 1-inch (2.5
cm) brush covering half of the panel. The iron oxide dirt slurry was prepared by dispersing 125 g of
Mapico 422 iron oxide in 250 g of water in presence of 0.1 g of TAMOLTM 731A Dispersant. The
panels with the slurry were dried for 4 h in a hood. The dried slurry was removed under a stream of
water with gently rubbing with a clean piece of cheesecloth. The panels were air dried for at least 2
h. Y reflectance values were measured over the slurry treated areas by the following formula:
                                               Y reflectance (slurry treated area)

[0047]    The results show that incorporation of fluoroalkyl groups into the protuberating core
portion, and PEM into the shell portion of the acorn substantially improves dirt pick-up resistance
over particles with acorn morphology that include PEM in the core (Comparative Example 1) or
PEM in the core and the shell (Comparative Example 2) or the fluoroalkyl groups in the core but no
PEM in the shell (Comparative Example 3).
