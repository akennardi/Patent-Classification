                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           1. Field of Invention
 0         The present invention relates to a pump; and more particularly to a pump
   having an impeller with front and back sides.
           2. Description of Related Art
           In a typical centrifugal pump, fluid is accelerated through centrifugal forces
 5 exerted on it by an impeller. An impeller is a rotating disk driven by a motor whose
   front side has vanes extruding from it, which are used to transmit energy to the fluid
   being pumped. The rear or back side of the impeller is usually made as smooth as
   possible in order to reduce friction losses caused by the disk's rotation in the fluid
   being pumped. However, some shortcoming related to an impeller having a smooth
20 rear or back side include the fact that debris can collect near the shaft seal and
   possibly cause pump jamming and failure of the shaft seal. Debris can also jam in
   between the backside of the impeller and the motor housing and cause the pump to
   lock up.
           United States Patent No. 5,489,187, entitled, "Impeller Pump With Vaned
25 Backplate for Clearing Debris", discloses a set of stationary vanes added to the
   backplate of a seal chamber in a centrifugal pump to help clear the area of the seal
                                                  1

   chamber of entrained air bubbles and debris using the fluid motion created by the
   impeller. The '187 patent also discloses vanes on the back side of the impeller as a
   means to encourage the flow which runs over the stationary vanes. However, some
   shortcoming related to '187 impeller design include the fact that it relies on complex
 5 flow patterns to achieve its purpose. These patterns may be difficult and time
   consuming to predict and may vary from pump to pump. Also, the construction is
   composed of rotating and stationary vanes and debris can possibly get wedged
   between these two vanes and jam up the pump.
           See also United States Patent No. 5,019,136, which discloses a pump
 0 including an impeller having a backside with either rear straight radial vanes, or rear
   straight inclined vanes that are inclined rearwardly relative to the direction of rotation,
   or rear curved longer and shorter vanes curved rearwardly relative to the direction of
   rotation, or a combination of rear curved longer and shorter vanes curved rearwardly
   relative to the direction of rotation, e.g., also having gas discharge openings.
 5         See also US 2012/0051897, which discloses a pump having a combination of
   a suction liner and an impeller, where the suction liner has curved vanes and the
   impeller has forward curved impeller suction side pump out vanes.
           There is a need in the art for a pump having a better impeller design that
   overcomes the aforementioned problems with these known designs.

                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
           According to some embodiments, the present invention may take the form of
   an apparatus, including a pump, featuring an impeller configured as a rotating disk
   having a front side and a back side, the impeller being arranged to rotate on a shaft
25 with the front side nearest an inlet and the back side nearest a motor housing, so as
                                                   2

   to provide a main flow of liquid being pumped and a rear impeller flow of the liquid
   being pumped in an area between the back side of the impeller and the motor
   housing, the back side comprising a spiral-shaped vane configured to constantly
   sweep, and expel any debris from, the area between the back side of the impeller
 5 and the motor housing, the spiral-shaped vane being formed as a curve that
   emanates from a central point or axis of the impeller and gets progressively farther
   away as the curve revolves at least one complete revolution around the central point
   or axis.
          The present invention may also include one or more of the following features:
 0         In particular, and by way of example, the spiral-shaped vane may take the
   form of a logarithmic spiral-shaped vane which is added to the backside of an
   impeller that constantly sweeps an area between the back of the impeller and the
   motor housing forcing any debris which has entered out to the periphery of the
   impeller where it is expelled through the outlet along with the main flow. This helps
 5 to prevent the problems caused by debris collecting near the shaft seal and also
   jamming in between the back of the impeller and the motor housing.
          The logarithmic spiral-shaped vane, e.g., being substantially defined by the
   equation:
20                                         r = eenta(P)
          where the parameters r and theta (G) are respectively the radius and
   azimuthal angle defined using a polar coordinate system having an origin at a center
   point of the impeller; and the parameter beta (P) is an angle perpendicular to which a
25 force acting on the debris will be oriented relative to a line tangent to a circle
                                                 3

   centered at the center of the impeller and extending out to the point of contact
   between the vane and the debris.
           The spiral-shaped vane may include, or takes the form of, a single curve that
   emanates from a central point or axis of the impeller and gets progressively farther
 5 away as the curve revolves more than 1 1/2 times (over 5400) around the central
   point or axis.
           The impeller may be configured to rotate about the center point in a direction
   of rotation, and the logarithmic spiral-shaped vane may include, or take the form of, a
   spiral that emanates from the central point and curves progressively farther away
 0 from the central point in an opposite direction from the direction of rotation.
           The front face may include one or more vanes that are used to impart a force
   from the motor onto the liquid being pumped causing the liquid to flow.
           The logarithmic spiral-shaped vane may provide a force that is substantially
   perpendicular, due to the construction of the logarithmic spiral-shaped vane from the
 5 aforementioned equation, that will be at the chosen angle relative to a line tangent to
   a circle drawn at any given radius at which the debris may come in contact with the
   vane.
           The pump may include a shaft seal between the shaft and the pump housing.
           The pump may be a centrifugal pump.
20         According to some embodiment, the pump may also include the pump
   housing and the motor housing, including where the pump housing has an inlet for
   receiving a liquid to be pumped and an outlet for providing the liquid to be pumped
   via the main flow, and where the motor housing is arranged in the pump housing and
   has a motor arranged therein with the shaft.

   the pump according to the present invention is capable, e.g., of relying on the
   logarithmic spiral-shaped vane as a primary source of removing debris and not as a
   source of increased flow. It also does not have, and is not required to have,
 5 stationary vanes, e.g., on the motor housing, which could potentially cause jamming
   of the pump if debris is caught between the stationary and moving vanes.

   expel any debris from, the area between the back side of the impeller and the motor
   housing, the logarithmic spiral-shaped vane being substantially defined by the
   equation:

   azimuthal angle defined using a polar coordinate system having an origin at a center
 0 point or axis of the impeller; and

20 therein with a shaft; and
           an impeller configured as a rotating disk having a front side and a back side,
   the impeller being arranged to rotate on the shaft with the front side nearest the inlet
   and the back side nearest the motor housing, so as to provide the main flow of the
   liquid being pumped and a rear impeller flow of the liquid being pumped in an area
25 between the back side of the impeller and the motor housing, the back side

               DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF BEST MODE OF THE INVENTION
                                  Figures 1A to 1C (Prior art)
            Figures 1A to 1C show a typical centrifugal pump configuration, where liquid
 5 enters through an inlet (1) of a pump housing (20) and is accelerated by an impeller
   (2) to its periphery due to centrifugal forces caused by the rotation of the impeller (2)
   from the action of a motor shaft (6) which is driven by a motor (5) arranged in a
   motor housing (9). A main flow (7) of the liquid exits through an outlet (4) of the
   pump housing (10). Some of the liquid being pumped forms part of a rear impeller
20 flow (8) that flows around to the back side (11) of the impeller (2) towards a shaft
   seal (3) before rejoining the main flow (7), consistent with that shown in Figure 1B.
            Debris suspended in the main flow (7) can be carried by the rear impeller flow
   (8) and become lodged in the space between the back (11) of the impeller (2) and
   the motor housing (9) causing pump lock up and failure.
                                                10

           By way of example, Figure 1C shows the front and back of a typical impeller.
   The front of the impeller consists of one or more vanes (10) which are used to impart
   the force from the motor onto the liquid and cause it to flow. The back or backside of
   the typical impeller is smooth (11).
 5         Observation has shown that pumps, e.g., like that shown in Figures 1A to 1C,
   having impellers without back vanes jammed up and stopped pumping several times.
   Heavy scratches were also observed from the debris on the back side of the impeller
   and on the motor housing area.
 0                                        Figures 2-3
           Consistent with that shown in Figures 2-3, the whole thrust of the present
   invention is to expel any debris which enters the area of the rear impeller flow (e.g.,
   see reference label (8) in Figure 1B) through the addition of a spiral-shaped vane
   (12), e.g., being formed as a curve that emanates from a central point or axis c of an
 5 impeller I and gets progressively farther away as the curve (12) revolves at least one
   complete revolution (3600) around the central point or axis c.
           According to some embodiments of the present invention, and by way of
   example, the spiral-shaped vane (12) may include, or take the form of, a logarithmic
   spiral-shaped vane (12) on the back IBof the impeller I, e.g., whose geometry may
20 be defined by the equation:
                                          r = ee/tan(p)
   where the parameters r and theta (e) are the radius and azimuthal angle defined
25 using a polar coordinate system whose origin is at the central point, center or axis c
                                               11

   of the impeller I and beta (P) is the angle perpendicular to which the force (as shown
   and labeled in Figure 3) acting on the debris will be oriented relative to a line tangent
   to a circle centered at the center of the impeller and extending out to the point of
   contact between the vane and the debris.
 5         Figure 2 shows the back IBof the impeller I in which the present invention has
   been implemented and the logarithmic spiral-shaped vane (12) is in place. In Figure
   2, the spiral-shaped vane (12) is configured as, or takes the form of, a single curve
   that emanates from the central point or axis c of the impeller I and gets progressively
   farther away as the curve (12) revolves about 6300 (i.e., 1 and 3/4 revolutions)
 0 around the central point or axis c. In Figures 2-3, by way of example, the spiral
   shaped vane (12) is shown as a single curve, although the scope of the invention is
   not intended to the number of such spiral-shaped vanes used.
           Figure 3 shows a force (indicated by the associated arrow) that will be acting
   upon any debris which comes in contact with the rear spiral-shaped vane (12),
 5 according to some embodiments of the present invention. This force will be
   perpendicular (as shown in Figure 3) to the logarithmic spiral-shaped vane (12)
   which, e.g., due to its construction from the aforementioned equation, will be at the
   chosen angle, e.g., beta (P), relative to a line T tangent to a circle C centered at the
   center of the impeller I and drawn at any given radius r at which the debris may
20 come in contact with the logarithmic spiral-shaped vane (12), and extending out to
   the point of contact between the logarithmic spiral-shaped vane (12) and the debris,
   consistent with that shown in Figure 3.
           By way of example, the impeller I in Figures 2-3 may be exchanged with or
   replace the impeller (2) shown in Figures 1A to 1C for implementing at least one
25 embodiment of the present invention.
                                               12

          In contrast to the observation set forth above, a similar observation has shown
  that pumps having impellers with spiral-shaped back vanes according to the present
  invention were able to pass all of the debris through without jamming up and no
  damage was observed on the back of the impeller or on the motor housing after the
5 testing. For these reasons, pumps, e.g., like that disclosed in relation to Figures 2-3,
  appear to provide an important improvement over pumps, e.g., like that shown in
  Figures 1A to 1C.
                                              13

                    Logarithmic Spiral, Equiangular Spiral or Growth Spiral
           As a person skilled in the art would appreciate, a logarithmic spiral,
   equiangular spiral or growth spiral is a self-similar spiral curve, e.g., which often
   appears in nature. Consistent with definitions known in mathematics, a self-similar
 5 object is generally understood to be exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself
   (i.e. the whole has the same shape as one or more of the parts); a spiral is generally
   understood to be a curve (i.e., non-straight line) which emanates from a central
   point, getting progressively farther away as the curve revolves around the central
   point; and a curve (also called a curved line) is generally understood to be an object
 0 similar to a line but which is not required to be straight.
                             Figures 4-8: Example of CFD Simulation
            By way of example, Figures 4-8 shows diagrams related to a computational
   fluids dynamics (CFD) simulation that was conducted of sand penetration into a gap
 5 between an impeller outer hub wall and a volute hub wall. In the CFD simulation,
   two pump geometries were analyzed: a case 1 for a pump geometery without a back
   vane impellerand a case 2 for a pump geometry with a back vane (e.g., 10 degree
   angle). In the CFD simulation, a Fluent 14.5 code was used, and a turbulence k-w
   SST model was used with conditions, as follows:
20                 A rotation speed of about 3450 rpm;
                   On the inlet, a water-sand mixture with about 2 kg/s of water and about
           0.13 kg/s of sand; and
                   Sand particles diameter was about 1 mm.
                                                14

                                              Figure 4
           Figure 4 shows a pump P having a pump housing PH, an inlet and an outlet,
   along with a plane section labelled A-A, indicated for the purpose of discussing
   results of the CFD simulation of sand penetration into a gap between an impeller
 5 outer hub wall and a volute hub wall.
                   Figure 5: Comparison of Negative Radial Velocity (NRV)
           The CFD simulation resulted in the data shown in Figure 5 having negative
   radial velocities in relation to the plane section A-A in Figure 4 for case 1 (Fig.5A)
 0 and case 2 (Fig. 5B).
           In Figures 5A and 5B, the impeller is shown in the form of a white outline (no
   grey scale shading) and outlined by the grey scale shading. The spiral-shaped vane
   is indicated by four arrows labeled (12). In Figure 5B, and by way of example, arrows
   shown the direction of NRV are shown, labeled accordingly and point towards the
 5 center or axis of the impeller labeled I.
           From the diagrams in Figure 5 one can see that the area with negative radial
   velocity on the gap for case is much larger compared with the corresponding area
   with negative radial velocity on the gap for case2, because the spiral-shaped back
   vane for case 2 significantly reduced the negative radial velocity area on the gap
20 between the impeller outer hub wall and the volute hub wall.
              Figures 6-7: Sand concentration on section A-A for cases 1 and 2
           Figs. 6A, 6B, and Figs. 7A, and 7B, show sand concentration in the gap
   between the impeller outer hub wall and the volute hub wall on section A-A section in
25 Figure 4 for case and case2 respectively.
                                                 15

           Fig.6B is the amplification zone of the highlighted oval or eliptical region in the
   Fig.6A; and Fig.7B is the amplification zone of the highlighted oval or eliptical region
   in the Fig. 7b.
           In Figs. 6B and Fig. 7B, the areas empty of sand particles are indicated by
 5 associated braces and textual labeling. The clear difference between the size of the
   areas empty of sand particles in Figs. 6B and 7B indicates that the back vane (case
   2) prevents the penetration and concentration of more sand particles into the gap
   between the impeller outer hub wall and the volute hub wall.
 0                                          Figure 8
           Figs. 8A and 8B shows traces of particles, e.g., including in the gap between
   the impeller outer hub wall and the volute hub wall on section A-A section in Figure 4
   for case 1 and case 2 respectively. The particle traces are indicated by grey scale
   shading and traced by particles residence time. By way of example, the CFD
 5 simulation included about 900 particles total.
           Fig. 8A shows and indicates particles that penetrated into the gap between
   the impeller outer hub wall and the volute hub wall for case 1 (without the spiral
   shaped back vane).
           In contrast, Fig. 8B shows and indicates no particles that penetrated into the
20 gap between the impeller outer hub wall and the volute hub wall for case 2 (with the
   spiral-shaped back vane).
