METHOD FOR DETERMINING A DIRECTION OF A USEFUL SIGNAL
SOURCE
[0001] The invention relates to a method for determining at least one direction of a useful signal
source in an acoustic system that comprises at least a first input transducer and a second input
transducer, wherein the first input transducer generates a first input signal from a sound signal
from the surroundings and the second input transducer generates a second input signal from the
sound signal.
[0002] For operation of a hearing device, the algorithms that are used for user-specific
amplification and, more generally, for tone matching to input signals of the hearing device that
are obtained from the ambient sound often need to be selected on the basis of a respective
hearing situation. In this case, the individual hearing situations are manifested as frequently
recurring patterns of overlays of interfering sounds or, generally, noise of a useful signal sound,
the patterns being standardized inter alia on the basis of the type of noise occurring, the signal
to-noise ratio, the frequency response of the useful signal sound and temporal variations and
mean values of the cited variables.
[0003] On the basis of the identified hearing situation, it is thus particularly possible for the
signal-to-noise ratio in the input signals to be improved in an efficient and resource-saving
manner, since this achieves a reduction in the noise by means of its properties that can be
expected statistically within the context of the standardization as a hearing situation.
[0004] Specifically in particularly complicated real acoustic surroundings - for example with
multiple noise sources, which additionally result in a high total noise level - improving the
sound quality can, however, result in the requirement for the position of a useful signal source,
for example a speaker in a conversation, to be located directly.
[0005] At present, it is known practice for useful signal sources to be located in binaural hearing
devices by means of a measurement of the delay time difference that results from the different
propagation times of a sound signal to the respective hearing aids of the binaural hearing device
that are worn on both ears of the user. However, such a measurement requires firstly a high level
of computational complexity and secondly the fastest possible and nevertheless detailed
transmission of the signal components from one hearing aid to the other hearing aid through

                                                   2
evaluation. The two cited requirements adversely affect the power consumption of the hearing
aids.
[0006] It is an object of the present invention to specify for an acoustic system a method that
locates a useful signal source as accurately as possible with the lowest possible level of
computational and system complexity, or to substantially overcome or at least ameliorate one or
more disadvantages of existing arrangements.
[0007] The cited object is achieved according to the invention by a method for determining at
least one direction of a useful signal source in an acoustic system that comprises at least a first
input transducer and a second input transducer, wherein the first input transducer generates a
first input signal from a sound signal from the surroundings and the second input transducer
generates a second input signal from the sound signal, wherein the first input transducer
generates a first input signal from a sound signal from the surroundings and the second input
transducer generates a second input signal from the sound signal, wherein the first input signal
and the second input signal are used to form a plurality of angle-dependent directional
characteristics having a respective given central angle and a respective identical angular
expansion, wherein the signal components pertaining to the individual directional characteristics
are examined for the presence of a useful signal from a useful signal source, and wherein the
applicable central angle is assigned to a useful signal source ascertained in a particular
directional characteristic as the direction of the useful signal source. Refinements that are
advantageous and in some cases inventive in themselves are the subject matter of the subclaims
and the description that follows.
[0008] In this context, an input transducer generally covers any acoustoelectric transducer that
produces an electrical signal from a sound signal, that is to say particularly also a microphone.
[0009] Preferably, the individual directional characteristics have a respective minimum or a
respective maximum sensitivity to a test signal from the applicable angular direction at their
respective central angle. The directional characteristics in this case include directional lobes, in
particular, which have the greatest sensitivity in the direction of their respective central angle,
the sensitivity decreasing each time the angular distance from the central angle increases. The
extent of the decrease in the sensitivity as the angular distance from the central angle increases
can be taken as a measure of the angular expansion of the directional characteristic in this case.

                                                    3
Alternatively, the individual directional characteristics can each also have a minimum sensitivity
to a given test signal at the respective central angle, the sensitivity to the test signal increasing as
the angular distance from the central angle increases. The extent of the increase in the sensitivity
as the angular distance from the central angle increases can then be used as a measure of the
angular expansion. Preferably, the central angles of two adjacent directional characteristics are
at a fixed angular distance from one another. This means that a kind of scan of an angular range
is performed by means of the individual directional characteristics, the central angle changing
by a constant amount in each case in the event of a transition from one directional characteristic
to its adjacent directional characteristic.
[0010] The examination of the signal components, including the presence of a useful signal,
from a useful signal source can be effected in the individual directional characteristics,
particularly on the basis of the signal level or on the basis of one or more variables that are
derived from the signal level.
[0011] The assignment of a central angle of a directional characteristic as the direction of a
useful signal source ascertained in the applicable directional characteristic now has the
advantage that this allows the useful signal source to be located even in the presence of other
useful signal sources, for example if a new, further useful signal source is added to an already
existent useful signal source with an applicable useful signal, said further useful signal source
being clearly physically separate from the first, already existent useful signal source. The
detection or location of the individual useful signal sources is not impaired by the presence of
other useful signal sources in this case, as might occur in the case of a location by means of
phase measurement, where every further useful signal source worsens the signal-to-noise ratio at
least as noise, and therefore could impair the robustness and also the angular resolution of the
locating. In particular, it is then possible to use permanent application, or application repeated at
short intervals of time, of the locating to achieve a temporal resolution for the locating of a
useful signal source. This therefore also allows physical tracking of a mobile useful signal
source. The direction of the useful signal source, which is determined as the result of the
method, can be used particularly to orient a directional lobe to the useful signal source during
the input conversion of the acoustic system, in order to use the directional lobe to improve the
signal-to-noise ratio of the useful signal source relative to the background noise.

                                                    4
[0012] Preferably, an angular distance between two directional characteristics that are adjacent
in respect of their central angle corresponds to half the angular expansion. In particular, the two
adjacent directional characteristics in this case have the same angular expansion. If the
individual directional characteristics are formed by directional lobes whose sensitivity is at a
maximum in the direction of the central angle, and decreases as the angular distance from the
central angle increases, this means particularly that an angle for which the sensitivity to a test
signal has fallen by a particular factor relative to the maximum value at the central angle, for
example 6 dB or 10 dB, can be specified for every single directional characteristic. Such an
angle is now assigned to the applicable directional characteristic as half an angular expansion,
and the central angle of the adjacent directional characteristic is accordingly chosen to be at an
angular distance of half an angular expansion. If notch-shaped attenuations of the sensitivity
with a minimum at the central angle are chosen as individual directional characteristics in each
case, a similar situation can apply, with a raise of the sensitivity relative to the minimum value
at the central angle being used for the definition of the angular expansion instead of the
attenuation of the sensitivity relative to the maximum value at the central angle. This allows
largely complete coverage by the individual directional characteristics to be attained for a
desired, wider angular range, whereas overlaps in the individual directional characteristics up to
the next central angle in each case mean that a useful signal source can always be clearly
assigned to at least one of the directional characteristics, the overlap also allowing angular
positions between two adjacent central angles to be resolved.
[0013] Advantageously, for each of the individual directional characteristics the central angle
and the angular expansion of the directional characteristic are determined by at least two
conditions. In particular, the directional characteristics can each be formed using the "linearly
constrained minimum variance" method on the basis of the conditions. This allows the
conditions, for example in the form of relative attenuations in the sensitivity, to be oriented in a
particular angular direction, and allows the respective directional characteristics to be formed
directly therefrom.
[0014] It is found to be advantageous if the individual directional characteristics are each
prescribed by a notch-shaped sensitivity characteristic that is determined by at least two
conditions, so that the at least two conditions each stipulate the central angle and the angular
expansion of the sensitivity characteristic. In this case, a notch-shaped sensitivity characteristic
is intended to be understood to mean a directional characteristic that has the maximum

                                                     5
attenuation in the sensitivity for a test signal of prescribed volume at the central angle, the
sensitivity increasing as the angular distance from the central angle increases. The extent of this
increase in the sensitivity on the basis of the angular distance from the central angle then defines
the angular expansion. If a useful signal source is situated in the direction of a central angle of
such a directional characteristic, or, within the context of the angular resolution, in direct
proximity to the central angle, that is to say within the "notch" of the sensitivity characteristic,
then the signal components of the useful signal are substantially attenuated by the directional
characteristic, whereas signal components of other useful signal sources that are situated outside
the angular expansion around the central angle of said directional characteristic are largely
retained. This can now be used to ascertain a presence of a useful signal source in the region of
the applicable directional characteristic.
[0015] Expediently, an acoustic characteristic variable is formed for each of the individual
directional characteristics from the signal components, the acoustic characteristic variables of
the directional characteristics are used to ascertain a useful signal in at least one of the
directional characteristics. The acoustic characteristic variable used in this case can be
particularly the maximum signal level over a suitable time window or the signal level averaged
over the time window, particularly only signal components in particular frequency bands also
being able to be used for the formation of the acoustic characteristic variables.
[0016] Preferably, in this case, the acoustic characteristic variable of the directional
characteristic is compared with the total value of the corresponding characteristic variable for
the first input signal and/or the second input signal, and a relative characteristic variable for the
directional characteristic is formed as a result, wherein the presence of a useful signal in at least
one of the directional characteristics is ascertained from the relative characteristic variable of the
directional characteristics. This means that the acoustic characteristic variable, for example a
signal level averaged over time, is first of all formed for each of the individual directional
characteristics, and subsequently the acoustic characteristic variable of each directional
characteristic is normalized using an appropriate characteristic variable that is derived from the
first input signal and/or from the second input signal. The normalization then forms for each
directional characteristic the relative characteristic variable that is ultimately used as a measure
of the presence of a useful signal in the directional characteristic. The characteristic variable
used for the normalization can be the reference level of the first input signal or of the second
input signal or else the total level of the first input signal and the second input signal, for

                                                   6
example. The effect that can be achieved by the normalization is that in hearing situations in
which the respective sound level or else the number of individual useful signal sources can
change, the resultant changes in the overall level do not affect the resolution of the locating of
the useful signal sources.
[0017] Preferably, in this case, the relative characteristic variables are each compared with one
another and/or with a prescribed limit value, and the presence of a useful signal in at least one of
the directional characteristics is ascertained therefrom. The comparison of the relative
characteristic variables with one another is found to be advantageous to the effect that it allows
the presence of a useful signal in the applicable directional characteristic to be inferred directly
from an extreme value (maximum or minimum) of a relative characteristic variable, depending
on the nature of the directional characteristics. To locate a plurality of useful signal sources,
however, it may also be advantageous to compare the relative characteristic variables with a
prescribed limit value that, when exceeded or fallen below, allows the presence of a useful
signal source to be inferred.
[0018] It is found to be advantageous if the characteristic variable used is a respective mean
value of the signal level over time, and the presence of a useful signal in a directional
characteristic is ascertained from an attenuation that the mean value of the signal level over time
experiences in the directional characteristic, normalized using the mean value of the total level
over time, as a result of the respective sensitivity characteristic. The time window for the
averaging can be dependent particularly on the nature of the useful signal sources that is to be
expected. If at least one of the useful signal sources is an interlocutor, for example, then the time
window can preferably be chosen such that particular frequency bands, e.g. format frequencies,
are excited to a sufficiently high degree.
[0019] In an advantageous refinement, a further input transducer generates a further input signal
from the sound signal, wherein the directional characteristics are formed on the basis of the first
input signal, the second input signal and the further input signal. Preferably, the further input
transducer is physically separate from the first input transducer and from the second input
transducer in this case. The addition of the further input signal increases the total available phase
information about the sound signal, so that the directional characteristics can be used to achieve
a higher angular resolution.

                                                   7
[0020] It is found to be particularly advantageous in this case if the individual directional
characteristics are each provided by a plurality of conditions that is the same as the number of
input signals, so that the plurality of conditions each stipulate at least the central angle and the
angular expansion. This means that, in the case of four input signals from four physically
separate input transducers, for example, the individual directional characteristics can each be
stipulated by up to four conditions. This allows particularly narrow angular expansions and
therefore a particularly high angular resolution to be attained.
[0021] The invention further cites an acoustic system, comprising at least one first input
transducer for producing a first input signal from a sound signal from the surroundings, a second
input transducer, a second input transducer for producing a second input signal from the sound
signal, and a signal processing unit that is set up to perform the method described above. In
particular, the acoustic system is configured as a hearing device. The advantages cited for the
method and the developments thereof can be transferred mutatis mutandis to the acoustic system
in this case.
[0022] An exemplary embodiment of the invention is explained in more detail below with
reference to the accompanying drawings.

                                                     8
[0028] Figure 1 schematically depicts a plan view of a hearing situation 1. In the left-hand
depiction of figure 1, a user 2 of an acoustic system 4, which in the present case is configured as
a binaural hearing device, is in a conversation with a first interlocutor 6, who is positioned at the
front relative to the line of vision of the user 2, that is to say is standing at an angle of 0 degrees
relative to the user 2. For this hearing situation 1, the binaural hearing device has located the
position of the interlocutor 6 as part of its resolution options. After some time in the
conversation, a second interlocutor 8 now joins, which results in a new hearing situation 1'. The
second interlocutor 8 is positioned approximately at an angle of -45 degrees relative to the line
of vision of the user 2. If a directional characteristic oriented to the first interlocutor 6 is now
formed in the binaural hearing device, for example to better amplify the original signal, that is to
say the signal from the first interlocutor 6, then components of the conversation of the second
interlocutor 8 are rejected or not sufficiently captured by such a directional characteristic. So as
now to be able to perform direction-dependent rejection of background noise in the changed
hearing situation 1', and also not to substantially reject contributions to the conversation by the
second interlocutor 8 relative to those of the first interlocutor 6, it is of considerable advantage
to locate the position of the second interlocutor 8 as accurately as possible.
[0029] Figure 2 depicts a block diagram of the sequence of a method 10 for determining a
direction of a useful signal source in an acoustic system 4. In the present case, the useful signal
source is provided by the first interlocutor 6 or the second interlocutor 8 in one of the two
hearing situations 1, 1' which are in figure 1. The acoustic system 4 is formed by a binaural
hearing device in the present case. The binaural hearing device comprises a first local unit 12
and a second local unit 14, which can each be worn on the left or right ear of the user 2 when the
binaural hearing device is used as intended. The first local unit 12 or the second local unit 14 has
a first input transducer 16 or a second input transducer 18 that generates a first input signal 20 or
a second input signal 22 from a respective incoming sound signal from the surroundings. The
first input transducer 16 and the second input transducer 18 are each provided by a microphone
in the present case. If need be, a further input transducer 19 may also be provided that produces
a further input signal 23.
[0030] For a plurality of central angles aj, which cover the front hemisphere of the user 2 in
steps of 15 degrees in both directions starting from 0 degrees, a first filter parameter F 1(Cj) and
a second filter parameter F2(aj) are now each defined on the basis of two conditions BI, B2.
The first filter parameter FI (aj) and the second filter parameter F2(aj) are in this case of a nature

                                                    9
such that they form a notch-shaped sensitivity characteristic 24 by means of convolution with
the first input signal 20 or the second input signal 22 in a manner yet to be described. If the first
input signal 20 and the second input signal 22 are thus each filtered using the first filter
parameter F1(aj) or the second filter parameter F2(aj), then the sum of the resultant signals has a
much lower sensitivity for signal components whose signal source is in the direction of the
central angle aj of the sensitivity characteristic 24 than for signals whose signal source is in
another direction. For the signal 26 resulting from the filtering described, an acoustic
characteristic variable 28 is now formed by virtue of the signal level of the resultant signal 26
being averaged over a prescribed interval of time. The acoustic characteristic variable 28 formed
from the averaged signal level is normalized using a reference level 30, and in this way a
relative characteristic variable 32 is formed. In the present case, the reference level 30 is
provided by a mean value of the level of the first input signal 16 over time. Alternatively, the
reference level 30 used may also be a mean value of the overall level over time, that is to say of
the level of the sum of the first input signal 16 and the second input signal 18. The relative
characteristic variables 32 thus formed for a central angle aj are now each compared with one
another. In the comparison 34, each central angle aj whose sensitivity characteristic 24 has the
relative characteristic variable 32 with the lowest value is now stipulated as the direction of a
useful signal source.
[0031] Figure 3 depicts a plan view of a directional characteristic 34 with a central angle aj   =
10 degrees and a prescribed expansion A. In this case, the directional characteristic is formed by
a sensitivity characteristic 24 whose central angle aj is defined by the direction having the
lowest sensitivity. The concepts of "linearly constrained minimum variants" directional
characteristics (LCMV) can be used to define each of the central angle aj and the expansion A
by means of a given attenuation of the signal components at the central angle aj itself and at a
further angle. In the present case, the angular expansion A is determined by virtue of the signal
level being attenuated by 20 dB at a central angle cj of -10 degrees, and the signal level being
attenuated by 6 dB in the frontal direction, that is to say at 0 degrees. This defines a notch
shaped sensitivity characteristic 24 that has substantially lower sensitivity for signals whose
source is in the region of the central angle aj, and rejects such signals accordingly.
[0032] If the signal level averaged over time is now first of all formed method depicted in figure
2 for a signal whose signal source is in the direction of the central angle aj = -10 degrees, that is
to say in the case of an accordingly positioned interlocutor, for example, according to the

                                                   10
sensitivity characteristic 24, then said signal level has the lowest possible value as acoustic
characteristic variable 28 for the present signal source of all the angle-dependent sensitivity
characteristics 24. The acoustic characteristic variable 28 obtained in this manner is now
normalized using the total level averaged over time or the level of one of the two input signals
20, 22 averaged over time. This results, in the event of a speaker, that is to say a useful signal
source, being absent in the region of the central angle aj, in all contributions being captured for
normalization essentially even without attenuation in the acoustic characteristic variable 28.
Only when a useful signal source is present in the region of the central angle aj is the
contribution of the useful signal to the acoustic characteristic variable 28 substantially rejected
by the sensitivity characteristic 24, whereas the contribution to the normalization by the useful
signal is retained. The corresponding decrease in the relative characteristic variable 32 then
allows the presence of a useful signal source in the direction of the central angle aj to be safely
inferred.
[0033] Figure 4 depicts the relative characteristic variables 32a to 32c for each of three different
central angles over a time axis t, said characteristic variables being assignable to the hearing
situations 1, 1 depicted in figure 2. Up to a time of approximately 4.5 seconds, the user 2 is
only in conversation with the first interlocutor 6. The relative characteristic variables 32a to 32c,
which are formed in a prescribed manner for sensitivity characteristics with central angles of -30
degrees (32a), -45 degrees (32b) and -60 degrees (32c), consequently have no kind of reference
points for a useful signal source in the applicable angular range. At approximately 4.5 seconds,
the transition from hearing situation 1 to hearing situation 1' now occurs, the second interlocutor
8 joins and, in so doing, makes contributions to the conversation that now enter the processes
described above as a sound signal. The contributions to the conversation by the second
interlocutor 8 and the further presence of the first interlocutor 6 mean that the normalization
changes first of all for each of the three relative characteristic variables 32a to 32c depicted. The
most distinct attenuation of the contribution of the second interlocutor 8 is effected, as expected,
by the sensitivity characteristic with the central angle at -45 degrees, so that the relative
characteristic variable 32b accordingly also adopts the lowest value therefor. For the other two
central angles -30 degrees and -60 degrees, the applicable sensitivity characteristics mean that a
certain attenuation of the voice activity of the second interlocutor 8 still takes place. However,
this attenuation is no longer as pronounced as in the case of the sensitivity characteristic at -45
degrees. Accordingly, a drop in the value can be seen in the relative characteristic variables 32a
and 32c, which does not approach the reduction from -45 degrees (32b), however. From this, it

                                                 11
is now possible to infer the joining of the second interlocutor 8 at approximately 4.5 seconds at
an angle of -45 degrees.
[0034] Although the invention has been illustrated and described in more detail by the preferred
exemplary embodiment, the invention is not limited by this exemplary embodiment. Other
variations can be derived therefrom by a person skilled in the art without departing from the
scope of protection of the invention.
