   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
             The present invention relates to smoke alarms and in particular to an
   apparatus and method of installing a flush fit smoke alarm.
 5 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
             Smoke alarm are used in domestic and commercial buildings to alert
   occupants to the presence of a fire or smoke, to thereby enable them to escape a fire
   before succumbing to smoke inhalation or burns. Smoke alarms may be attached to
   the ceiling or internal walls in various locations throughout the building to provide
10 adequate monitoring.
             Some battery-operated smoke alarms comprise a mounting plate that is fixed
   to a ceiling or wall surface using screws. A smoke alarm housing including the
   monitoring apparatus is then reversibly attached to the mounting plate. These types
   of smoke alarms however may tend to protrude excessively into the room, which may
15 detract from the appearance. For this reason, flush mounted alarms with a lower
   profile, have become common in the market.
             Many smoke alarms are now hard wired to the mains power source of the
   building and may also be interconnected so that if one smoke alarm detects the
   presence of smoke, all interconnected alarms are activated. These hard-wired
20 smoke alarms also typically include a backup battery such as a 9VDC battery, so that
   the smoke alarms can still operate when the main power is cut, such as during a
   blackout.
             There are a number of smoke alarms on the market that are referred to as
   'flush fit smoke alarm'. These types of smoke alarms have a lower profile than
25 conventional smoke alarms and typically engage through a hole is a ceiling or wall
   panel. A rear portion of the smoke alarm is held rearwardly of the panel and a front
   portion having an inlet or inlets, extends into the room space.
             One of these low profile or recessed design smoke alarms sold under the
   CLIPSAL@ Trade Mark, is configured to be inserted in through a 90mm cut out in a
30 panel. Threaded shafts on opposite sides of the smoke alarm, which are accessible

                                                  2
   from within the room, can be turned to thereby cause respective arm members to
   rotate outwardly and be drawn down onto a rear surface of the panel. In this way the
   smoke alarm can be held in place through the hole. The installer however needs to
   use a screwdriver or Allen key to turn the shaft which can be time consuming.
 5         It should be appreciated that any discussion of the prior art throughout the
   specification is included solely for the purpose of providing a context for the present
   invention and should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art
   was widely known or formed part of the common general knowledge in the field as it
   existed before the priority date of the application. The reader will appreciate that the
10 phrase flush fit does not mean that the lower part of the smoke alarm is flush with the
   panel, rather it will be understood to refer to smoke alarms having a lower profile.
   Furthermore, the present invention could be used on hard wired or solely battery
   operated smoke alarm systems.
            It is an object of the present invention to provide an easily mounted flush fit
15 smoke alarm. It is another object of the present invention to overcomes at least
   some of the aforementioned problems or provide the public with a useful alternative.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
            In one aspect of the invention, but not necessarily the broadest or only
   aspect, there is proposed a flush fit smoke alarm for a ceiling or wall panel,
20 comprising:
   a front portion including an inlet or inlets for receiving air therethrough to monitor the
   presence of smoke;
   a rear portion extending rearwardly from said front portion and adjacent a
   circumferential shoulder thereof; and
25 at least two arms hingedly connected to the rear portion and biased by respective
   biasing members, such that a free end of each arm is urged toward or against said
   circumferential shoulder;
   wherein the arms are movable against said bias, such that the arms are foldable
   back against or adjacent sides of the rear portion, whereby the rear portion and
30 folded arms being insertable in through a hole in said panel, whereupon the arms are
   pivotable under the influence of the respective biasing member such that the free
   ends of the arms bear against a rear surface of the panel to thereby clamp said panel
   between the circumferential shoulder and said arms.

                                                 3
           The present invention therefore provides a method of installing a flush fit
   smoke alarm through a hole in a ceiling or wall panel that can be undertaken without
   the necessity for tools, such as a screw driver or Allen key.
           The installer is able to fold back the arms prior to insertion of the rear portion
 5 through the hole in the panel and then once the arms are rearwardly clear of the
   edge of the hole the biasing members then urge the arms to pivot such that the free
   ends thereof bear against or abut the rear surface of the panel.
            Preferably, the rear portion includes respective mounts for the arms and
   biasing members. In one form each mount comprises two spaced apart protrusions
10 that include coaxially aligned apertures therethrough.
            Each arm may be generally planar and include flanges on opposite sides
   thereof. The flanges include coaxially aligned apertures, for alignment with the
   apertures in the protrusions of said mount, whereby a locating pin can be inserted
   therethrough to provide a pivot for the arm relative to the rear portion.
15         The biasing member in one form is a spring having a first locating end and a
   second elongate end that is configured to extend outwardly toward the free end of
   the arm. A mid helical portion of the spring being configured to be engaged
   therethrough by the locating pin.
           When assembled each arm is connected to the rear portion by a respective
20 locating pin, which also engages through a helical portion of a respective spring such
   that the spring is held between the spaced apart flanges of the arm.
            Preferably, the free end of each of the arms is generally broad and may
   include an edge that is rearwardly curved to inhibit damage to, or incision of, the rear
   of the panel.
25         The mounts are located inwardly of the edge of the circumferential shoulder,
   wherein the arms are biased against said shoulder or an edge thereof.
           The smoke alarm is thereby held in place by the arms that bear against the
   rear of the panel and such that the circumferential shoulder is held against at front
   surface of the panel.

                                                  4
            To remove the smoke alarm from within the hole in the panel, for repair or
   replacement, the front portion can be grasped and pulled down against the influence
   of the biasing members. The arms are thereby caused to pivot rearwardly which
   allows the rear portion to be retracted through the hole in the panel.
 5          In another aspect of the invention there is proposed a method of installing a
   flush fit smoke alarm through a hole in a panel, including the steps of:
   providing a smoke alarm, comprising a front portion, a rear portion adjoining the front
   portion adjacent a circumferential shoulder and at least two arms hingedly connected
   to the rear portion and biased by respective biasing members, such that a free end of
10 each arm is urged toward or against said circumferential shoulder;
   moving said arms against the bias of respective biasing members, such that the arms
   are folded back against or adjacent respective sides of the rear portion;
   inserting the rear portion and arms in through said hole in the panel;
   permitting the arms to pivot under the influence of the biasing members such that the
15 free ends of the arms bear against a rear surface of said panel to thereby clamp said
   panel between the circumferential shoulder and said free ends of the arms.
            The above method wherein the flush fit smoke alarm can be removed from
   within the hole in the panel by grasping the front portion and pulled down against the
   influence of the biasing members, wherein the arms are caused to pivot rearwardly to
20 thereby allow the rear portion to be retracted through said hole in the panel.

   chamber, will not be described as they would be obvious to a person skilled in the
   art.
           Turning to Figures 1 to 7, there is illustrated one embodiment of the smoke
   alarm 10 including, a front portion 16 having inlets 18 for receiving air therethrough to
 5 monitor the presence of smoke. A rear portion 20 extends rearwardly from the front
   portion 16, adjacent a circumferential shoulder 22, as best illustrated in Figures 2 and
   3.
           Arms 24, 26 are attached to opposite sides of the rear portion 20 and extend
   outwardly therefrom. The arms 24, 26 are hingedly connected to the rear portion 20
10 and biased by respective biasing members 28, 30, such that respective free ends 32
   of each arm 24, 26 are urged against the circumferential shoulder 22, as illustrated in
   Figures 2 to 4.
           As illustrated in Figures 6 and 7, the rear portion 20 includes respective
   mounts 34 for the arms 24, 26. The mounts 34 comprise two spaced apart
15 protrusions 36, 38, each including an aperture 40 that coaxially the aperture 40 on an
   adjacent protrusion 36 or 38. The reader will appreciate that since the mounts 34 are
   located inwardly of the edge of the circumferential shoulder 22, the arms 24, 26 are
   biased against a rear edge of the shoulder 22, as illustrated in Figure 4.
           Each arm 24, 26 is generally planar and includes flanges 42, 44 on opposite
20 sides. The flanges 42, 44 include coaxially aligned apertures 46, for alignment with
   the apertures 40 in the protrusions 36, 38.
           A locating pin 48 is inserted through the aligned apertures 40, 46, to provide a
   pivot for the arm 24 or 26 relative to the rear portion 20.
           The biasing members 28, 30 are wire springs having a first locating end 50, a
25 second elongate end 52 that is configured to extend outwardly toward the free end
   32 of the arm 24 or 26, and a helical portion 54 being configured to be engaged
   therethrough by a respective locating pin 48.
           As illustrated in Figure 3 and 4, when assembled each arm 24, 26 is
   connected to the rear portion 20 by a respective locating pin 48, which also engages
30 through the helical portion 54 of a respective spring 28 or 30, such that the spring is
   held between the spaced apart flanges 42, 44 of a respective arms 24 or 26.

                                                 7
           As further illustrated in Figures 6 and 7, the free end 32 of each of the arms
   24, 26 is generally broad and includes an edge 56 that is rearwardly curved to inhibit
   damaging or incision of the rear of the panel 14.
           In use, as illustrated in Figures 8a to 8d, a hole 12 is cut through a panel,
 5 such as a ceiling panel 14. The installer then aligns the rear portion 20 of the smoke
   alarm 10 with the hole 12 or a pre-existing hole in the panel 14. As illustrated in
    Figure 8b, the installer then folds back the arms 24, 26 rearwardly against the bias of
   springs 28, 30, such that they are held adjacent respective sides of the rear portion
   20 and do not substantially extend sidewardly therefrom.
10         The rear portion 20 and folded arms 24, 26 can then be insertion in through
   the hole 12 in the direction of the solid arrow, as illustrated in Figure 8b.
           Once the arms 24, 26 are rearwardly clear of the edge of the hole 12 and the
   circumferential shoulder 22 is bearing against the front surface of the panel 14 the
   biasing members 28, 30 urge the arms 24, 26 to pivot, as indicated by the solid
15 curved arrows in Figure 8c.
            The arms 24, 26 continue to pivot until the free ends 32, of the arms 24, 26
   bear against or abut the rear surface of the panel 14, as illustrated in Figure 8d. The
   smoke alarm 10 is thereby held in place by the biased arms 24, 26 that bear against
   the rear of the panel 14 which causes the circumferential shoulder to be held against
20 the front surface of the panel 14.
           The skilled addressee will appreciate that to remove the smoke alarm 10 from
   within the hole 12 in the panel 14 the front portion 16 can be grasped and pulled
   down against the influence of the biasing members 28, 30, such that the arms 24, 26
   pivot rearwardly which allows the rear portion 20 to be retracted through the hole 12.
25         The skilled addressee will now appreciate the advantages of the illustrated
   invention over the prior art. In one form the invention provides a simplified apparatus
   and method for installing a smoke alarm through an existing hole in a panel that can
   be undertaken without the requirement for specialised tools, such as a screw driver
   spanner or Allen key.
30         Various features of the invention have been particularly shown and described
   in connection with the exemplified embodiments of the invention, however it must be

                                             8
