   Field of the Present Disclosure
   Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to swimming pool cleaners and, more
15 particularly, to automatic swimming pool cleaners movable along an underwater pool
   surface for purposes of cleaning debris therefrom. Some embodiments of the present
   disclosure relate to swimming pool cleaners having the flow of water pumped and/or
   sucked by remote pumps using negative pressure into and through the pool cleaners,
   also referred to as a suction cleaner.
20
   Background of the Present Disclosure
   Automatic swimming pool cleaners of the type that move about the underwater
   surfaces of a swimming pool are driven by many different kinds of systems. A variety
25 of different pool-cleaner devices in one way or another harness the flow of water, as it
   is drawn or pushed through the pool cleaner by the pumping action of a remote pump
   for debris collection purposes.
   The present disclosure is applicable to both pressure and suction cleaners. An
30 example of a suction (negative pressure) cleaner is disclosed in commonly-owned
   United States Patent No. 6,854,148 (Rief et al.), entire contents of which are

   incorporated herein by reference. An example of a pressure cleaner is disclosed in
   commonly-owned United States Patent No. 6,782,578 (Rief et al.), entire contents of
   which are incorporated herein by reference.
 5 Referring to FIGS. 1-4, a suction cleaner 100 of the prior art for use in a swimming
   pool is disclosed. The suction cleaner 100 can be in accordance with U.S. Pat. No.
   5,105,496 to Gray, Jr. et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,536,908 to Raubenheimer, which are
   incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and which are discussed in part in
   this Background of the Present Disclosure section. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the
10 suction cleaner 100, which includes a housing 102, a rear inlet 104, walking pods
    106, and a cone gear 108 that engages a suction hose 17. FIG. 2 is a partial sectional
   view of the suction cleaner of FIG. 1 taken along line 2-2 of FIG. 1 showing a prior art
   rocker arm, rocker arm locomotion system, and steering system. Referring to FIG. 2,
   there is shown the primary and secondary fluid flow paths for a suction device for
15 cleaning swimming pools. Water enters a primary flow path at the primary fluid inlet
    112. It meets the fluid from one of the secondary fluid outlets 114, continues past the
   primary turbine 116, and joins with the other secondary fluid outlet 118. The primary
   turbine 116 is mounted on a shaft 120 having eccentric cams 122. As the primary
   turbine 116 turns, it turns the rocker arms 124 which are on pivots 126 and which
20 extend out to walking pods 106 which cause the suction device 100 to move forward.
   The fluid from the primary and secondary flow paths is discharged through the cone
   gear 108 (e.g., the primary fluid outlet) which is connected to the suction hose 110 as
   shown in FIG. 1.
25 Continuing with a discussion of the prior art, in the secondary fluid flow paths, fluid
   enters at the secondary fluid inlet 130, which extends across the rear inlet, passing
   through a cleaner steering gear assembly 131 that includes a pair of secondary
   turbines 132, 134. The first secondary turbine 132 is housed within a gearbox 136.
   The second secondary turbine 134 is housed within a chamber 137. The secondary
30 turbines 132, 134 work together to intermittently apply torque about the axis of the
   suction hose 110. The top secondary turbine 134 turns the suction hose 110 thereby

   C:\Interwon\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16976507_l docx-[ 5 05 2018
                                                            -3
   providing the torque. The bottom secondary turbine 132 provides the change in
   direction of the torque applied by the top secondary turbine 134 by causing a reverse
   in the rotation of the top secondary turbine 134. This operation is similar to that
   described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,521 ,933 to Raubenheimer, which is incorporated herein
 5 by reference in its entirety.
   The fluid outlet from the bottom secondary turbine 132 passes through the integral
   screen 138 and out the secondary fluid outlet 114 at the inlet of the primary turbine
    116. The fluid outlet from the top secondary turbine 134 passes through internal
10 screen 140 and out the secondary outlet 118 at the top of the primary turbine 116.
   A captured screw 142 mounted in a mounting 144 rigidly positions and secures a
   removable door 146. Guide channels 148 fixedly position the filter screen 138 at the
   discharge of the bottom secondary turbine 132 thereby preventing back wash from
15 the primary turbine inlet from entering the secondary fluid outlet 114.
   Continuing with a discussion of the prior art, FIG. 3 shows a cross section of the
   suction cleaning device 100 ready for use. The location of the removable door 146 is
   outlined and is shown to be positioned over the entrance to the primary flow path and
20 the primary turbine inlet. The turbine 116 is housed in the housing 102 and secured to
   the housing walls 149 by means of bearings 150 on the turbine shaft 120. It will be
   seen that if water flows from the primary fluid inlet 112 to cone gear 108 (e.g., the
   primary fluid outlet), the turbine 116 will rotate. Also on the shaft 120 are the eccentric
   cams 122 which are between rocker arm bearings 152 fitted to the rocker arms 124.
25 The eccentric cams 122 are 180 degrees out of phase with each other. As the shaft
   120 rotates, the rocker arms 124 will rock back and forth about the pivots 126.
   Continuing with a discussion of the prior art, FIG. 4 is a partial sectional view of the
   suction cleaner of FIG. 1 taken along line 3-3 of FIG. 2 showing the prior art rocker
30 arms of the locomotion system with the turbine removed. Further, FIG. 4 shows a
   cross-section of the suction cleaning device 100 without the turbine 116, and showing

   C:\Interwon\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16976507_l docx-[ 5 05 2018
                                                            -4
   the rocker arms 124 in greater detail. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 4, each rocker arm
    124 includes a body 154 with two arms 156 extending therefrom. Each of the two legs
    156 of the rocker arms 124 includes a respective rocker arm bearing 152, as
   discussed above. Each rocker arm 124 is integrated with a walking pod 106 to which
 5 it is connected by the pivot 126. The pivot 126 can include a square end where it
   connects with the walking pod 106 such that rotation of the pivots 126 is imparted to
   the walking pods 106. The inner ends 158 of the pivots 126 are secured for rotation in
   a split bearing 160 on the housing 102.
10 Continuing with a discussion of the prior art, as the turbine 116 rotates, the turbine
   shaft 120 and eccentric cams 122 also rotate, with the turbine shaft 120 rotating
   within the bearings 150 that are secured to the housing 149. As the eccentric cams
    122 respectively rotate between and engage a pair of rocker arm bearings 152, which
   are secured to a respective rocker arm 124, they push the rocker arms 124 in
15 opposite directions. That is, because of the eccentric cams 122 are 180 degrees out
   of phase with one another, one of the eccentric cams 122 will push the rocker arm
    124 that it is engaged with rearward (e.g., clockwise rotation about the pivot 126),
   while the a second of the eccentric cams 122 will push the rocker arm 124 that it is
   engaged with forward (e.g., counter-clockwise rotation about the pivot 126).
20 Accordingly, continued rotation of the turbine 116 causes the rocker arms 124 to rock
   back and forth. As the rocker arms 124 rock, their movements are imparted to the
   walking pods 106. The result is that as the turbine 116 rotates, the walking pods 106
   rock and the whole device moves forward.
25 However, the rocker arms 124 of the prior art and four associated bearings 150 (two
   bearings per arm) are vulnerable to extreme wear and tear due to fine sand and
   debris. Contact shock between the bearings 150 and the eccentric cams 122 of the
   turbine 116 are also adverse to the bearings, resulting in replacement that can be
   costly to replace. Additionally, the turbine 116 has a ridged fixed shape and is also
30 supported by two bearings on either rend that also suffer from wear and tear in a
   short period of time, which can be costly. Generally, there is an excessive clearance

   C:\Interwon\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16976507_l docx-[ 5 05 2018
                                                            -5
   between the bearings 152 of the rocker arms 124 and the turbine eccentric cams 122,
   such that when the eccentric cams 122 rotate contact between the eccentric cams
    122 and the bearings 152 is lost for a period of time, resulting in a hammer or
   knocking effect to occur when the eccentric cams 122 come back into contact with the
 5 bearings 152. This hammer effect can result in damage to the bearings 152 and the
   eccentric cams 122.
   Continuing with a discussion of the prior art, as previously discussed in connection
   with FIG. 2, the housing includes a gearbox 136 housing a first secondary turbine
10  132, and a chamber 137 housing a second secondary turbine 134. Two passages
    162 port into the chamber 137 and the interior space 164 of the housing. The interior
   space 164 is in fluidic communication with the passages 162 and the rear inlet 104,
   such that fluid can flow through the rear inlet 104, into the interior space 164 and
   across the passages 162. The ports 162 to the chamber 137 are controlled by a valve
15 plate 166, which is discussed in greater detail below.
   Continuing with a discussion of the prior art, the cleaner steering gear assembly 131
   of the prior art includes the cone gear 108 that has a large gear wheel 168, and a
   drive pinion 174. The drive pinion 174 is connected to a gear 176 by a shaft 178. The
20 cleaner 100 further includes the first and second secondary turbines 132, 134, the
   valve plate 166 connected to a gear 170 by a shaft 172, and a gear reduction stack
    180. The first secondary turbine 132 includes a pinion 182 that meshes with an input
   gear to the gear reduction stack 180, all of which is located in the gearbox 136. The
   gear reduction stack 180 includes an output gear that meshes with the gear 170
25 connected to the shaft 172 and valve plate 166. Fluid that flows through the rear inlet
   104 and into the interior space 164 can flow across the passages 162 into the
   chamber 137 and across gearbox openings 184 and into the gearbox 136. Fluid
   flowing into the gearbox 136 rotates the first secondary turbine 132 which outputs to
   the gear reduction stack 180, which in turn outputs to the gear 170 causing the valve
30 plate 166 to rotate. As the first secondary turbine 132 rotates the valve plate 166, the
   valve plate 166 alternately covers and uncovers the ports 162 with relatively long

   C:\Interwon\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16976507_l docx-[ 5 05 2018
                                                            -6
   periods when both parts are covered. When one of the ports 162 is covered fluid
   flowing through the open port 162 will cause the second secondary gear 134 to rotate
   clockwise, while when the other of the ports 162 is covered fluid flowing through the
   other open port 162 will cause the second secondary turbine 134 to rotate counter
 5 clockwise. When both ports 162 are covered the second secondary turbine 134 does
   not spin. Accordingly, alternately covering and uncovering the ports 162 causes the
   second secondary turbine 134 to change direction of rotation.
   Continuing with a discussion of the prior art, the second secondary turbine 134
10 includes an output pinion 186 that meshes with the gear 176 connected to the drive
   pinion 174 by the shaft 178. The drive pinion 174 meshes with the large gear wheel
    168 of the cone gear 108. Accordingly, as the second secondary turbine 134 rotates,
   the pinion 186 rotates the gear 176, causing the drive pinion 174 to rotate. In turn, the
   drive pinion 174 rotationally drives the large gear wheel 168 thus applying a high slow
15 speed torque to the cone gear 108. Rotation of the second secondary turbine 134 in a
   clockwise direction results in clockwise rotation of the cone gear 108, while
   counterclockwise rotation of the second secondary turbine 134 results in counter
   clockwise rotation of the cone gear 108.
20 Continuing with a discussion of the prior art, as one of the ports 162 are uncovered,
   the second secondary turbine 134 applies a torque to the cone gear 108 which in use
   is attached to the suction hose 110. The hose 110 will resist the turning movement
   and the net effect is that the whole cleaner 100 turns around the axis of the cone gear
    108. When the then open port is closed, the device will be facing a random new
25 direction usually different from its original direction. Of course, the running of the
   second secondary turbine 134 will constantly tend to move the cleaner 100 in its
   forward direction at any given time so that in turn a somewhat spiral movement will
   take place (when one of the ports 162 are open).
30 Summary of the Disclosure

   Embodiments of the present disclosure provides for improved steering systems,
   locomotion systems, turbines, and turbine vanes for swimming pool cleaners
   including suction cleaning devices.
 5  In some embodiments of the disclosure a steering system for a suction cleaner device
   is connectable to a suction source by a suction hose. The steering system includes a
   turbine rotatably connected with a main rotatable member that drives a cam drive
   train and a steering drive train. The cam drive train rotatably drives a cam
   mechanism, which includes a cam gear and a cam wheel, through engagement with a
10 cam gear thereof. The steering drive train is movable through engagement with the
   cam wheel and includes a pinion gear that is positionable in plurality of steering
   positions. In a first steering position the pinion gear engages a first track of a nose
   cone and rotationally drives the nose cone in a first direction. In a second steering
   position the pinion gear engages a second track of the nose cone and rotationally
15 drives the nose cone in a second direction. The cam wheel can have a plurality of
   outer profile regions of varying radii, that each correspond to one of the plurality of
   steering positions. The steering system can include a roller connected to the pinion
   gear, such that the roller is biased against the outer-profile regions of the cam wheel
   to ride there along, thereby moving the pinion gear between the plurality of steering
20 positions.
    In some embodiments of the disclosure, a locomotion system for a pool cleaner
   includes a turbine, first and second A-frame arms, and first and second walking pods.
   The turbine includes two eccentrics with bearings positioned thereabout, the
25 eccentrics having central axes offset from the turbine central axis such that rotation of
   the turbine results in rotation of the eccentrics and the respective axes about the
   turbine central axis. The locomotion system further includes first and second A-frame
   arms pivotally secured about a pivot shaft, and each including a forked body. The
   bearings and respective eccentrics are positioned within and in engagement with the
30 forked body of a respective A-frame arm such that each bearing and eccentric is
   engaged with an A-frame arm. Each A-frame arm further includes a keyed head

   C:\Interwon\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16976507_l docx-[ 5 05 2018
                                                            -8
   extending therefrom and coaxial with the pivot shaft. Each keyed head is configured
   to engage a socket of a walking pod, such that each A-frame arm is engaged with a
   respective walking pod. Rotation of the turbine causes the first eccentric central axis
   and the second eccentric central axis to rotate about the turbine hub central axis thus
 5 forcing the first A-frame arm to rotate in a first direction and resulting in the first
   walking pod rotating in the first direction, and the second A-frame arm to rotate in a
   second direction and resulting in the second walking pod rotating in the second
   direction opposite from the first direction. Rotation of the first and second walking
   pods results in locomotion.
10
    In some embodiments of the disclosure, a turbine includes a turbine rotor having a
   plurality of vanes connected thereto. The turbine vanes can include a distal end and a
   proximal end, with the proximal end being connected to the turbine rotor. A body
   extends between the proximal end and the distal end such that the body is generally
15 "V"-shaped with the distal end being wider than the proximal end. This shape creates
   two lateral fluid passages on the sides of the body that permit increased fluid flow
   across the turbine.
    In some embodiments of the disclosure, each of the plurality of vanes can be pivotally
20 connected to the turbine rotor via a vane-rotor interconnection. The vane-rotor
   interconnection can be comprised of a slotted cavity on the turbine rotor that is
   engaged by an elongate member formed at the proximal vane edge of the vanes,
   such that the elongate member is secured within the slotted cavity. The slotted cavity
   and the elongate member can have non-congruent shapes that form an
25 interconnection with a hollow space therebetween. The hollow space facilitates
   washing out of debris from within the interconnection to minimize locking of pivotal
   movement of the vane with respect to the rotor. Additionally, at least one of the
   slotted cavity and the elongate inner member can have a substantially polygonal
   cross-section, or an irregular-shaped cross-section.
30
   In some embodiments of the disclosure, a turbine includes a turbine rotor having a

   C:\Interwon\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16976507_l docx-[ 5 05 2018
                                                            -9
   rotor axis and a plurality of vanes connected thereto. The vanes include a proximal
   vane edge and a distal vane edge with a body extending between the proximal and
   distal vane edges. Each of the plurality of vanes is connected with the turbine rotor at
   an interconnection that permits rotation of the proximal vane edge to positions of
 5 varying angles with respect to the rotor axis.
    In some embodiments of the disclosure, the rotor can include a rotor shaft having a
   plurality of substantially planar shaft surfaces at substantially equal angle with respect
   to one another, with one of the plurality of vanes supported with respect to each of the
10 shaft surfaces. Additionally, the proximal edge of each vane can include a cavity while
   each planar shaft surface includes a protrusion extending therefrom. The protrusion
   of each shaft surface can engage a cavity of one of the plurality of vanes to form the
   interconnection. The rotor can further include first and second cuffs that have inner
   surfaces that are each substantially equidistantly spaced from and parallel to a
15 corresponding shaft surface, forming inner-surface corners that limit the angle of
   rotation of the vanes. In such configuration, the vanes can include first and second
   elongate proximal edges with the first elongate proximal edge extending between the
   first cuff and the rotor shaft, and the second elongate proximal edge extending
   between the second cuff and the rotor shaft.

   Detailed Description of the Present Disclosure
10
   In the description which follows, like parts are marked throughout the specification
   and drawings with the same reference numerals, respectively. Drawing figures are
   not necessarily to scale and in certain views, parts may have been exaggerated or
   omitted for purposes of clarity.

   This disclosure relates to an improved automatic swimming pool cleaner of the type
   motivated by flow of water therethrough to move along a pool surface to be cleaned.
   The flow of water may be established by pumping action of a remote pump
   communicating with the pool-cleaner body through a hose connected to the cleaner,
20 such as for a suction cleaner. The present disclosure further relates to an automatic
   swimming pool cleaner, such as a suction cleaner, that includes a fluid driven steering
   system including a cam mechanism for automatically varying motion of the cleaner
   between right turn motion, left turn motion, and no-turn motion. The present
   disclosure still further relates to an automatic swimming pool cleaner, such as a
25 suction cleaner, including an improved A-frame and turbine for locomotion.
   Additionally, the present disclosure relates to improvements in fluid turbines for
   swimming pool cleaners.
   For example, in embodiments, the pool cleaner of the present disclosure has a
30 steering system connected to the hose to direct movement of the pool cleaner with
   respect to the hose.

   FIG. 5 is a diagrammatic partial-sectional view of a steering system 200 of the
   present disclosure incorporated into a turbine-driven suction cleaner body 202
   showing some components of the steering system 200 exploded. Additionally, FIG. 5
 5 is a side view of the steering system 200. As illustrated in FIGS. 5-15, the steering
   system 200 includes a steering drive mechanism 204 incorporated into and secured
   with respect to the cleaner body 202. The steering drive mechanism 204 includes a
   main rotatable member 206, a steering drive train 212, and a cam drive train 214 (see
   FIG. 6A). FIGS. 6A and 7 best illustrate the details of the inventive steering system
10 200. FIG. 6A is an exploded cross-sectional side view of the steering system taken
   along lines A-A seen in a fragmentary top plan view of FIG. 6. FIGS. 6A and 7 show
   that the main rotatable member 206 is operatively connected to both a steering
   mechanism 208, which is seen on the right side of FIG. 6A, and a cam mechanism
   210, seen on the left side of FIG. 6A. The steering drive train 212 extends from the
15 main rotatable member 206 to the steering mechanism 208 which is secured with
   respect to the cleaner body 202 and to the hose (not illustrated) for steering the
   cleaner body 202 in a plurality of directions with respect to the hose. FIGS. 5 and 6
   illustrate the cam drive train 214 which includes a set of reduction gears 216, 218,
   220 extending from the main rotatable member 206 to the cam mechanism 210. The
20 cam mechanism 210 includes a cam drive gear 222 in contact with gear 220 of the
   cam drive train 214.
   The cam mechanism 210 includes a cam wheel 224 rotatably secured with respect to
   the cleaner body 202 and operatively connected to the steering mechanism 208 for
25 switching between steering modes. Cam wheel 224 is rotated by the cam drive gear
   222. FIGS. 7-9 illustrate cam wheel 224 having outer-profile regions of greater and
   lesser radii each corresponding to one of the directions of the steering mechanism
   208.
30 In some embodiments, the steering drive mechanism 204 includes a steering pinion
   gear 226 and first and second gear tracks 228, 230 for steering movement of the

   cleaner body 202 with respect to the hose. The steering pinion gear 226 is driven by
   the steering drive train 212 and movable into one of the steering positions, including
   first and second positions each in engagement with one of the gear tracks 228, 230
   for steering the cleaner body 202 in one of clockwise and counter-clockwise
 5 directions around the hose.
   The steering pinion gear 226 may also be movable into a third steering position
   between the tracks 228, 230 for steering the cleaner body 202 in a substantially no
   turn position with respect to the hose.
10
    In certain versions, the steering drive train 212 further includes a roller 232 connected
   to the pinion gear 226 and biased against the outer-profile regions of the cam wheel
   224 to ride there along, thereby moving the pinion gear 226 between the steering
   positions. In some embodiments, the first gear track 228 is of a smaller radius than
15 the second gear track 230, and the tracks 228, 230 are coaxial.
   n certain embodiments, such as that illustrated in FIG. 9, the cam wheel 224 has
   three outer-profile regions of lesser 234, medium 236, and greater 238 radii each
   corresponding to one of the steering directions. When the roller 232 rides the lower
20 radii region 234, the pinion gear 226 engages the smaller-radii gear track 228 and
   steers the cleaner body 202 in one of the directions around the hose. When the roller
   232 rides the greater radii region 238, the pinion gear 226 engages the outer of the
   gear tracks 230 and steers the cleaner body 202 in the other of the directions around
   the hose. And, when the roller 202 rides the medium radii region 236, the pinion gear
25 226 is between the gear tracks 228, 230 and steers the cleaner body 202 in a
   substantially no-turn direction with respect to the hose.
   Some embodiments of the inventive pool cleaner, such as those illustrated in FIGS. 7
   and 8A-8C, also include a swivel arm 240 pivotally held by the body 202 and having a
30 distal end 242 biased by a spring 244 against the cam-wheel 224 outer profile. Such
   pool cleaners may also include a steering shaft 247 journaled in the swivel-arm 240

   distal end 242. The steering shaft 247 supports the roller 232 and the pinion gear 226
   for movement between the steering positions. In some examples, the pool cleaner
   includes a spring 244 which biases the swivel arm 242 toward the cam wheel 224.
 5  In certain embodiments, such as those illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7, the cam drive
   train 214 includes a reduction gear assembly 216, 218, 220 secured with respect to
   the body 202 and linking the main rotatable member 206 with the cam wheel 224
   such that rotation of the cam wheel 224 occurs upon rotation of the main rotatable
   member 206. In such embodiments, the cam wheel 224, acting through the swivel
10 arm 240, alternately moves the pinion gear 226 to one of the steering positions.
   The cam mechanism 210 may have a single-piece cam member which includes the
   cam wheel 224 and a coaxial cam drive gear 222 for its rotation.
15 FIG. 6A illustrates the main rotatable member 206 which is rotatably connected to the
   swivel arm 240 through a swivel arm gear set 246, 248, 226. The illustrated swivel
   arm gear set 246, 248, 226 has a constant force imposed by a spring 244.
   FIG. 9 is top plan view of one example of cam wheel 224. FIG. 9 shows lower 234,
20 medium 236, and higher 238 profiles of cam wheel 224 which is turned by the cam
   drive train 214. Roller 232 is shown constantly turning in contact with the outside
   diameter of cam wheel 224. Roller 232 follows along the contours on the cam wheel
   224 by having constant tension on it from the spring 244.
25  In some embodiments, such as those shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the steering system
   further includes a hose-mounting structure 250. As used herein, the hose-mounting
   structure 250 may also be referred to as, and/or characterized as, a cone gear
   structure, a cone drive gear structure, and/or a cone gear hose connection. The hose
   mounting structure 250 defines a water-flow passage 252 therethrough and includes
30 a hose-connecting portion 254 and outward portion 256, the outward portion 256
   forming the first and second gear tracks 228, 230 concentric with the hose, the first

   gear track 228 being of a smaller radius than the second gear track 230, and the
   tracks 228, 230 are coaxial.
    In certain of such embodiments, the outward portion 256 forms a gear-track cavity
 5 258. FIG. 6A shows the gear-track cavity 258 with spaced inner and outer walls each
   forming a respective one of the first and second gear tracks 228, 230. The figures
   illustrate a hose-mounting structure 254 as a cone with gear cavity 258. Cone gear
   structure 250 is held by the hose causing the cleaner to turn around the cone gear
   structure 250 when roller 232 engages on the low or high profile 234, 238 of cam
10 wheel 224. The pinion gear 226 is disposed within the cavity 258 for engagement with
   the first gear track 228 to steer the cleaner body 202 in one of clockwise and counter
   clockwise directions with respect to the hose and with the outer of the gear tracks 230
   to steer the cleaner body 202 in the other of the clockwise and counter-clockwise
   direction around the hose.

   The steering system 200 may also include a neutral steering mode with the pinion
   gear 226 positioned in the space between the gear tracks 228, 230 to steer the
   cleaner body 202 in a substantially no-turn direction around the hose.
20 FIGS. 7-8C illustrate the direction of rotation being determined by whether the pinion
   gear 226 is running on the inside or outside 228, 230 of the cone gear structure 250
   or is in a position between the gear tracks 228, 230. Depending on engagement of
   roller 232 with cam wheel 224 the pool cleaner 202 will turn left, stay in neutral
   (running substantially straight), or turn right. Cone gear structure 250 uses the
25 force/tension, e.g., torque resistance, of the hose to turn around the hose while
   alternating between left, neutral and right.
    In certain of such embodiments, the single-piece cam member 224 is secured to the
   hose-mounting structure 254 in a position concentric with the hose such that the cam
30 member 224 is substantially concentric with the gear tracks 228, 230.

   FIG. 7 is a fragmentary top plan view of one example of the inventive steering system
   200. FIG. 7 shows an exemplary configuration of gears and the direction that the
   gears turn. The cone gear structure 250 is shown as the only gear that alternates
   between turning clockwise, counterclockwise and idles in no-turn neutral position.

   FIGS. 8A-8C are fragmentary top plan views of the example of the inventive steering
   system of FIG. 7.
   FIG. 8A shows a position when cam wheel 224 comes around and, due to the
10 constant force from spring 244, roller 232 engages with cam wheel 224 on the higher
   profile 238 position. With roller 232 in such higher-diameter position, the pinion gear
   226 engages the outer gear track 230 of the cone drive gear structure 250 which is
   held by the hose. Due to such engagement of pinion gear 226 with the outer gear
   track 230, the cleaner 202 is being steered to turn counterclockwise.

   FIG. 8B shows a position when cam wheel 224 comes around and, due to the
   constant force from spring 244, roller 232 engages with cam wheel 224 on the
   medium profile 236 position such that pinion gear 226 is out of engagement with
   either of the inner or outer gear tracks 228, 230. Such lack of engagement of the
20 pinion gear 226 with either of the gear tracks 228, 230, leaves the cleaner 202 in a
   neutral steering position allowing the cleaner 202 to move along with the hose
   substantially straight, e.g., without turning around the hose.
   FIG. 8C shows a position when cam wheel 224 comes around and, due to the
25 constant force from spring 244, roller 232 engages with cam wheel 224 on the lower
   profile 234 position. With roller 232 in such lower-diameter position, the pinion gear
   226 engages the inner gear track 228 of the cone drive gear structure 250 which is
   held by the hose. Due to such engagement of pinion gear 226 with the inner gear
   track 228, the cleaner 202 is being steered to turn clockwise.

   The pool cleaner body 202 forms a water-flow chamber having water-flow inlet and
   outlet ports. In some embodiments, the steering drive mechanism 204 is moved by
   the flow of water. In some alternative embodiments, the steering drive mechanism
10 204 is moved by an electric motor operatively connected to the main rotatable
   member 206.
    In certain of the embodiments, the steering drive mechanism 204 is moved by the
   flow of water. Examples of such embodiments include FIGS. 5, 6, 6A, and 10-14. In
15 such embodiments, the cleaner includes a steering turbine 260 which is driven by the
   flow of water established by pumping action of a remote pump in one of suction and
   pressure flow directions. In FIGS. 5 and 10-14, the cleaner is shown with the steering
   turbine 260 mounted in communication with a water-flow chamber 262 for rotation by
   the flow of water. FIGS. 5 and 14 show versions of the pool cleaner which have two
20 turbines, including the steering turbine 260 and a drive turbine 264 which is rotatably
   mounted within the water-flow chamber 262 for moving the cleaner body 202 along
   the pool surface to be cleaned. It should be understood that in some embodiments of
   the present disclosure the drive turbine 264 may also perform the function of the
   steering turbine 260.
25
   As seen in FIG. 6, the steering turbine 260 has a steering rotor 266 rotatable about an
   axis. The main rotatable member 206 is connected to the steering rotor 266 through a
   compound drive gear 268 such that the main rotatable member 206 turns only in one
   direction and communicates such one-direction rotation to the cam drive gear 222
30 which also rotates only in one direction. The compound drive gear 268 can be
   provided as a gear stack.

   In some embodiments, the steering turbine 260 is mounted within the water-flow
   chamber 262 and the water-flow chamber 262 includes a steering-turbine
   compartment 270 in communication with the water-flow chamber 262 such that the
 5 steering turbine 260 is rotated by the flow of water motivated by the flow of water
   through the cleaner body 202. The steering-turbine compartment 270 has water-flow
   inlet and outlet ports 272, 274 positioned and arranged for the flow of water to rotate
   the steering rotor 266.
10 FIGS. 5 and 10-13 are schematic fragmentary cross-sectional side views which
   illustrate exemplary applications of the steering system 200 of FIGS. 6 and 6A

   assemblies 308a, 308b, a lower middle body 312, steering turbine assembly 314, an
   upper middle body 316, a steering system 318 including a nose cone 320, a top shell
   322, and a handle assembly 323. While the focus of the present disclosure is on three
 5 aspects of the suction cleaner 300, namely, the steering system 318, the locomotion
   system 600 (see FIGS. 34-36 and 48), and the drive turbine assembly 306, an
   overview of the entire cleaner 300 is provided for contextual purposes.
   The lower body 302 defines an internal cavity 326 that includes an inlet nozzle 324
10 thereto. The internal cavity 326 and inlet 324 allow water and debris to flow into the
   lower body 302 of the cleaner 300 and across the lower body 302 into the lower
   middle body 312, discussed in greater detail below. The lower body 302 further
   includes first and second A-frame side pivot openings 328a, 328b on opposite lateral
   sides thereof. The side pivot openings 328a, 328b allow a keyed (square) head 356
15 of each A-frame arm 304a, 304b to extend therethrough and out of the internal cavity
   326 of the lower body 302. A bushing 332 is provided around a shaft of the square
   head 356 of each A-frame arm 304a, 304b and is inserted into each side pivot
   opening 328a, 328b. A pivot lower bracket 334, pivot upper bracket 336, bushing 338,
   screw 340, and washer 342 are included in the lower body 302 for pivotally securing
20 the pivot shaft 330 of each A-frame arm 304a, 304b to the lower body 302. The lower
   body 302 further includes front and rear flaps 344a, 344b connected to the front and
   rear of the lower body 302, respectively. The front and rear flaps 344a, 344b can be
   spring biased away from the lower body 302 such that in operation as suction occurs
   the flaps 344a, 344b move inwardly to allow water to reach the inlet 324, while water
25 is prevented from flowing in from the sides. A flap adjuster 346 can be provided for
   the flaps 344a, 344b.
   The walking pod assemblies 308a, 308b are provided on lateral sides of the lower
   body 302 and each respectively connected with an A-frame arm 304a, 304b. The
30 walking pod assemblies 308a, 308b are mirror images of one another in structure and
   are placed on opposite sides of the lower body 302. The walking pod assemblies

   308a, 308b each include a walking pod body 348 that includes a square socket 350,
   and can also include side flaps 352 that can "snap-on" to the walking pod body 348.
   The square socket 350 of the walking pod body 348 is engaged by the square head
   356 extending from a respective A-frame arm 304a, 304b. The square head 356 is
 5 coaxial with the pivot shaft 330 of each A-frame arm 304a, 304b. Accordingly, rotation
   of the A-frame arms 304a, 304b about the respective pivot shaft 330 results in the
   square head 356 rotating or rocking the engaged walking pod assembly 308a, 308b,
   resulting in locomotion of the cleaner 300. Each A-frame arm 304a, 304b is
   respectively engaged with a walking pod assembly 308a, 308b by a screw assembly
10 354. Operation and engagement of the A-frame arms 304a, 304b with the walking
   pod assemblies 308a, 308b is discussed in greater detail below in connection with
   FIGS. 34-54.
   Still referencing FIG. 16, the lower middle body 312 defines a turbine housing 362,
15 first and second bushing housings 364a, 364b, and a rear opening 366. The lower
   middle body 312 is configured to be placed adjacent the lower body 302. The turbine
   housing 362 is configured to have a portion of the A-frame arms 304a, 304b inserted
   therein, to house the turbine 306, and be in fluidic communication with the internal
   cavity 326 and inlet 324 of the lower body 302 such that water flows in through the
20 inlet 324 and across the turbine 306, thereby operatively rotating the turbine 306. The
   first and second bushing housings 364a, 364b are positioned on opposite lateral
   sides of the turbine housing 362 and configured to fixedly engage first and second
   bushings of the turbine 306, discussed in greater detail in connection with FIGS. 34
   54. The rear opening 366 is configured to have a screen 368 inserted therein so that
25 water can flow into the lower middle body 312.
   As shown in FIG. 16, and further illustrated in FIG. 19, the upper middle body 316 is
   configured to be attached to the lower middle body 312 to encase the turbine 306,
   and generally includes an outlet boss 370 defining an outlet 371, and a rear opening
30 372. The upper middle body 316 further houses the steering turbine assembly 314,
   which is secured in a steering turbine chamber 373 (see FIG. 19) by a plate 374.

   Additionally, the upper middle body 316 includes first and second bushing housings
   375a, 375b (see FIG. 19) that are configured to be placed adjacent to the first and
   second bushing housings 364a, 364b of the lower middle body 312 and fixedly secure
   the first and second bushings of the turbine 306 when the upper middle body 316 is
 5 engaged with the lower middle body 312. The rear opening 372 (FIG. 19) is
   configured to have the screen 368 inserted therein such that the screen 368 is
   secured between the rear openings 366, 372 and water can flow into the upper and
   lower middle bodies 312, 316. As shown in FIG. 19, the upper middle body 316
   includes a turbine housing 376 that is configured to be placed adjacent to the lower
10 middle body turbine housing 362 when the upper middle body 316 is engaged with
   the lower middle body 312. The turbine housing 376 houses a portion of the turbine
   306 and is in fluidic communication with the outlet 371 and the lower middle body
   turbine housing 362. Accordingly, a continuous first flow path is provided from the
   inlet 324 at the bottom of the lower body 302 to the outlet boss 370 of the upper
15 middle body 316 that passes across the turbine As shown in FIGS. 16-18, the
   steering system 318 is positioned on and engaged with a top surface 378 of the upper
   middle body 316. The steering system 318 is a gearing assembly that is utilized to
   steer the cleaner 300, and is discussed in greater detail below in connection with
   FIGS. 17-25C. Still with reference to FIG. 16, the steering system 318 includes a cam
20 mechanism 380 and the nose cone 320. The cam mechanism 380 includes a central
   opening 382 extending through a boss 384. The cam mechanism 380 is positioned on
   the upper middle body outlet boss 370 (see FIGS. 19-23) such that the outlet boss
   370 is partially inserted into, and coaxial with, the cam mechanism boss 384 such that
   the cam mechanism 380 can rotate about the outlet boss 370 and water that flows
25 through the outlet boss 370 will also flow through the cam mechanism boss 384.
   Similarly, the nose cone 320 includes a nose 386 defining an outlet passage 388
   extending therethrough. The nose cone 320 is positioned on the cam mechanism
   boss 384 such that the cam mechanism boss 384 is partially inserted into, and
   coaxial with, the nose 386 so that the nose cone 320 can rotate about the cam
30 mechanism boss 384 and water that flows through the cam mechanism boss 384 will
   also flow through the nose 386 (see FIGS. 19-23). The nose 386 of the nose cone

   320 is configured to have a hose engaged therewith. In such an arrangement, a
   continuous path for water is provided from the inlet 324 at the bottom of the lower
   body 302 to the nose 386 and hose attached thereto, e.g., the first flow path.
   Accordingly, suction that is provided by the hose will pull water into the inlet 324,
 5 through the cleaner 302, and into the hose.
   Still with reference to FIG. 16, the top shell 322 includes a top opening 389 and is
   configured to be positioned over the steering system 318 and engaged with the upper
   middle body 316, such that the nose 386 extends through the top opening 389.
10 Accordingly, the top shell 322 secures the steering system 318 therein. Additionally,
   the top shell 322 generally restrains the nose cone 320, and therefore the cam
   mechanism 380 due to the interaction between the cam mechanism 380 and the nose
   cone 320, from lateral and vertical movement so that the steering system 318 does
   not become disengaged.

   With specific reference to FIGS. 17-25C, the steering system 318 of the present
   disclosure is discussed in greater detail. FIG. 17 is a top rear perspective view of the
   upper middle body 316, top shell 322 (shown as constructed from a transparent
   material, e.g., plastic), and the steering system 318. FIG. 17A is a top rear

25 front, right side, and left side views of the upper middle body 316 and steering system
   318 with FIG. 20 including a cut-out showing the steering turbine assembly 314.
   As previously detailed in connection with FIG. 16, the steering system 318 is
   generally positioned on top of and engaged with the top surface 378 of the upper
30 middle body 316. The steering system 318 includes the steering turbine assembly
   314, a steering drive mechanism 390, the cam mechanism 380, and the nose cone

   320. The steering turbine assembly 314 is generally housed in the steering turbine
   chamber 373 (see FIGS. 19 and 20) and secured therein by the plate 374 that is
   secured to the interior of the upper middle body 316.
 5 As shown in FIG. 20, the steering turbine assembly 314 includes a steering turbine
   392 and a compound drive gear 394 engaged with the steering turbine 392. The
   compound drive gear 394 includes a pinion 396 extending from and coaxial with the
   steering turbine 392 and a translation gear 398 that is meshed with the pinion 396
   such that rotation of the pinion 396 results in rotation of the translation gear 398. The
10 translation gear 398 includes a coaxial shaft 400 extending upwardly therefrom that
   extends through the upper middle body 316, and includes a main rotatable member
   (input gear) 402 engaged to an end opposite to where the shaft 400 engages the
   translation gear 398. The translation gear 398, the coaxial shaft 400, and the main
   rotatable member 402 are operatively connected such that rotation of the translation
15 gear 398 is translated to the main rotatable member 402 by the coaxial shaft 400.
   Accordingly, rotation of the steering turbine 392 rotates the pinion 396, which drives
   the translation gear 398, which in turn drives the main rotatable member 402. The
   main rotatable member 402 is the main driving component of the steering drive
20 mechanism 390, which is discussed in greater detail below.
   With reference to FIG. 19, the plate 374 includes one or more inlet openings 404 that
   allow fluid to enter the steering turbine chamber 373 and rotate the steering turbine
   392. More specifically, water is pulled through the screen 368 (see FIG. 16), which is
25 positioned in the rear openings 366, 372, into the lower and upper middle bodies 312,
   316, through the inlet openings 404, and into the steering turbine chamber 373. The
   steering turbine chamber 373 also includes an outlet 406 that is adjacent the turbine
   housing 376 such that a second flow path is created in which the water flowing into
   the steering turbine chamber 373 exits the steering turbine chamber 373 through the
30 outlet 406 and into the turbine housing 376 where it is introduced into and mixed with
   the water flowing through the cleaner 300 in the first flow path. Accordingly, suction

   from an associated hose not only pulls fluid through the inlet 324 of the lower body
   302 and through the first flow path, but also through the rear openings 366, 372 to
   drive the steering turbine 392, which in turn rotates the main rotatable member 402,
   and into the steering turbine chamber 373, e.g., the second flow path.

   Referring to FIGS. 20-23, and generally to FIG. 20, the steering drive mechanism 390
   includes a cam drive train 408 and a steering drive train 410, both being operatively
   engaged with the main rotatable member 402. Generally, the cam drive train 408
   operatively engages the cam mechanism 380 and the steering drive train 410
10 operatively engages the nose cone 320, which, as discussed above, is secured within
   the cleaner 300 and to a hose for steering the cleaner 300 in a plurality of directions
   with respect to the hose. The cam drive train 408 includes a set of reduction gears
   412, 414, 416 that each include a driven gear 412a, 414a, 416a and a drive gear
   412b, 414b, 416b, which are operatively engaged in sequence to reduce the angular
15 velocity output and increase the torque output. The third drive gear 416b meshes with
   and engages a cam drive gear 418 of the cam mechanism 380.
   The cam mechanism 380 includes a cam wheel 420 rotatably secured with respect to
   the upper middle body 316 and operatively connected to the nose cone 320 for
20 switching between steering modes. The cam mechanism 380 can be a unitary
   structure including the cam wheel 420 and the cam drive gear 418, which are coaxial
   with one another. Accordingly, the cam wheel 420 is rotated as the cam drive gear
   418 is driven by the third drive gear 416b. The cam wheel 420 is similar in structure to
   the cam wheel 224 illustrated in FIG. 9. In accordance therewith, the cam wheel 420
25 includes outer-profile regions of greater and lesser radii each corresponding to one of
   the directions of the nose cone 320. As illustrated in FIG. 9, the cam wheel 420 has
   three outer-profile regions of lesser 422, medium 424, and greater 426 radii each
   corresponding to one of the steering directions, which is discussed in greater detail
   below. The cam mechanism 380 can also include a bearing 427 (see FIG. 24)
30 between the cam wheel 420 and cam drive gear 418 combination, and the cam
   mechanism boss 384 such that the cam wheel 420 and cam drive gear 418 conjointly

   rotate about the boss 384, which can be secured in place in contact with the outlet
   boss 370 of the upper middle body 316.
   Still with reference to FIGS. 20-23, the steering drive train 410 includes an idler gear
 5 428 and a combination gear 430 having a driven gear 430a and a pinion drive gear
   430b. The driven gear 430a and the pinion drive gear 430b are coaxial and engaged
   with one another such that rotation of the driven gear 430a results in rotation of the
   pinion drive gear 430b. The idler gear 428 is operatively meshed with the main
   rotatable member 402 and the reduction gear driven gear 430a, such that the idler
10 gear 428 transfers rotation of the main rotatable member 402 to the driven gear 430a
   and thus the pinion gear 430b. The combination gear 430 also includes a roller 431
   positioned between the driven gear 430a and the pinion drive gear 430b. The roller
   431 is coaxial with the driven gear 430a and the pinion drive gear 430b, and rotatable
   about the axis shared between the driven gear 430a, the pinion drive gear 430b, and
15 the roller 431. The roller 431 is configured to engage the outer-profile regions 422,
   424, 426 of the cam wheel 420 to ride there along. The steering drive train 410 is
   mounted on a spring-biased swivel arm 432. The swivel arm 432 is pivotally mounted
   to the top surface 378 of the upper middle body 316 at a pivot 434. The pivot 434 is
   generally placed at a location such that the swivel arm 432 can rotate about the pivot
20 434 while maintaining the steering drive train 410 in operative engagement with, e.g.,
   meshed with, the main rotatable member 402. The swivel arm 432 further includes a
   slot 436 that is engaged by a pin 438 extending from the top surface 378 of the upper
   middle body 316. The slot 436 and pin 438 restrict the angular motion of the swivel
   arm 432 so that it can only rotate a predetermined amount. The swivel arm 432 also
25 includes a pin 440 that secures a spring 442 that is also secured to a pin 444
   extending from the top surface 378 of the upper middle body 316. The spring 442
   bias the swivel arm 432 so that the roller 431 is biased against and into contact with
   the outer-profile regions 422, 424, 426 of the cam wheel 420 to ride there along,
   thereby moving the pinion gear 430b between multiple steering positions.
30
   In another aspect of the present disclosure, the spring-biased swivel arm 432 can

                                                            - 33
   include a deformable arm that provides the spring-biasing force on the swivel arm
   432. The deformable arm can be formed as a compliant mechanism with the swivel
   arm 432. For example, the deformable arm can extend from the swivel arm 432 and
   be compressed (e.g., elastically deformed) against, for example, a wall when swivel
 5 arm 432 is forced outward through engagement of the roller with the cam wheel 420.
   The compression, e.g., elastic deformation, of the deformable arm generates a force
   that biases the swivel arm 432 so that the roller 431 is biased against and into contact
   with the outer-profile regions 422, 424, 426 of the cam wheel 420 to ride there along,
   thereby moving the pinion gear 430b between multiple steering positions.
10
    Interaction and connectivity of the gears of the steering assembly 318 is further
   illustrated in FIG. 24, which is a top view of the steering system 318 with the cam
   wheel 420 partially cut-away to show the underlying cam gear 418 that is conjoint with
   the cam wheel 420. Additionally, FIG. 24 shows the engagement between the cam
15 drive gear 418 and the third drive gear 416b of the cam drive train 408, as well as the
   engagement of the cam wheel 420 with the roller 431. More specifically, as the cam
   wheel 420 is rotated by the cam drive train, the roller 431 rides there along and
   transfers between the lesser radii 422, middle radii 424, and greater radii 426
   sections of the cam wheel 420 as they are rotated into contact with the roller 431.
20 When the roller 431 is engaged with the lesser radii section 422 of the cam wheel
   420, due to the bias implemented by the spring 442, the pinion gear 430b is in a first
   position (see FIG. 25A) that is radially closer to the rotational axis of the cam wheel
   420 than a second and third position. When the roller 431 is engaged with the
   medium radii section 424 of the cam wheel 420, due to the bias implemented by the
25 spring 442, the pinion gear 430b is in the second position (see FIG. 25B) that is
   radially closer to the rotational axis of the cam wheel 420 than the third position but
   radially further than the first position. When the roller 431 is engaged with the greater
   radii section 426 of the cam wheel 420, due to the bias implemented by the spring
   442, the pinion gear 430b is in the third position (see FIG. 25C) that is radially further
30 from the rotational axis of the cam wheel 420 than the first and second positions.

   The nose cone 320 includes the nose 386, a radial plate 446 (see FIG. 17A), and a
   gear track cavity 448 (see FIG. 19) on the underside of the radial plate 446 at the
   radial edge thereof that is defined by a first (inner) gear track 450 and a second
   (outer) gear track 452 (see FIG. 19). The first and second gear tracks 450, 452 are
 5 utilized for steering the movement of the cleaner 300 with respect to the hose
   attached to the nose 386 of the nose cone 320. As discussed above in connection
   with FIG. 20, the pinion gear 430b is rotatably driven by the steering drive train 410
   and is positioned in one of the three steering positions, e.g., the first, second, and
   third positions, by the cam wheel 420 engaging the roller 431. As discussed
10 previously in connection with FIG. 16, the nose cone 320 is positioned in the cleaner
   300 so that it is on top of the cam mechanism 380, with the cam mechanism boss 384
   extending into the nose 386 of the nose cone 320, and the nose cone rotates about
   the cam mechanism boss 384. When in this position, the pinion gear 430b is
   positioned within the gear track cavity 448. FIGS. 25A, 25B, and 25C are partial top
15 schematic views showing positioning of the pinion gear 430b with respect to the first
   and second gear tracks 450, 452 when in each of the first, second, and third positions
   respectively.
   As shown in FIG. 25A, which illustrates a first position of the pinion gear 430b, when
20 the pinion gear 430b is in the first position, e.g., the roller is engaged with the lesser
   radii section 422 of the cam wheel 420, the pinion gear 430b is meshed and engaged
   with the first (inner) gear track 450 to rotationally drive the nose cone 320 which is
   held by the hose. Because the nose cone 320 is secured with the hose, and because
   the pinion gear 430b is engaged with the first (inner) gear track 450, the cleaner 300
25 will be steered to turn clockwise. More specifically, the entire cleaner 300 rotates
   clockwise about the nose cone 320 and the hose.
   As shown in FIG. 25B, which illustrates a second position of the pinion gear 430b,
   when the pinion gear 430b is in the second position, e.g., the roller is engaged with
30 the middle radii section 424 of the cam wheel 420, the pinion gear 430b is positioned
   in the middle of the gear track cavity 448 and is not engaged with either of the first or

   C:\Interwon\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16976507_l docx-[ 5 05 2018

   second gear tracks 450, 452 and the nose cone 320, which is held by the hose, is not
   rotationally driven. In such a configuration, the cleaner 300 does not rotate about the
   hose but instead moves in a straight/forward direction.
 5 As shown in FIG. 25C, which illustrates a third position of the pinion gear 430b, when
   the pinion gear 430b is in the third position, e.g., the roller is engaged with the greater
   radii section 426 of the cam wheel 420, the pinion gear 430b is meshed and engaged
   with the second (outer) gear track 452 to rotationally drive the nose cone 320 which is
   held by the hose. Because the nose cone 320 is secured with the hose, and because
10 the pinion gear 430b is engaged with the second (outer) gear track 452, the cleaner
   300 will be steered to turn counter-clockwise. More specifically, the entire cleaner 300
   rotates counter-clockwise about the nose cone 320 and the hose.
    It should be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the rotation direction of
15 the pinion gear 430b, e.g., clockwise vs. counter-clockwise, can be controlled through
   the inclusion or exclusion of idler gears, such as idler gear 428 (see FIG. 24). In doing
   so, one can adjust which of the first and second gear tracks 450, 452 rotates the
   cleaner 300 in a clockwise direction and which rotates the cleaner 300 in a counter
   clockwise direction.
20
    In operation, the cleaner 300 is connected with an external pumping system by a
   hose that is connected with the nose 386 of the nose cone 320. The external pumping
   system provides a source of suction through the hose to provide a suction to the pool
   cleaner 300. The suction provided by the hose causes water to flow into the cleaner
25 300 from at least two spots. First, water is pulled into the cleaner 300 through the inlet
   324 of the lower body 302. Second, water is pulled into the cleaner 300 through the
   screen 368 that is inserted therein and secured between the rear openings 366, 372.
    In the first flow path, discussed in connection with FIGS. 16 and 19 above, the water
30 flowing through the inlet 324 of the lower body 302 flows across the lower body 302
   and into the turbine housing 362 of the lower middle body 312 and the turbine

   housing 376 of the upper middle body 316 (the two turbine housings 362, 376
   essentially create a single space), which houses the drive turbine assembly 306. The
   water flows across the drive turbine assembly 306 and exits the upper middle body
   316 through the outlet boss 370 and associated outlet 371. The water then flows
 5 through the central opening 382 of the cam mechanism 380, which is in fluidic
   communication with the outlet boss 370 and outlet 371 of the upper middle body 316.
   The water then flows out the opening 382 of the cam mechanism 380 and into the
   nose 386 of the nose cone 320 where it exits through the outlet 388 and enters the
   hose. Accordingly, a continuous flow path is provided from the inlet 324 at the bottom
10 of the lower body 302 to the nose cone outlet 388 where it enters the hose, which
   passes across the turbine 306. This flow path is utilized to clean the surfaces, e.g.,
   walls, of a pool or spa as debris is suctioned through the inlet 324, across the cleaner
   300, and exits through the nose cone outlet 388. Additionally, this flow path is utilized
   to operate the turbine 306 which is interconnected with the walking pods 308a, 308b
15 and causes the cleaner to "walk" across the pool surface.
    In the second flow path, discussed in connection with FIGS. 16 and 19 above, the
   water is suctioned through the screen 368, which is positioned in the rear openings
   366, 372, into the lower and upper middle bodies 312, 316, through the inlet openings
20 404, and into the steering turbine chamber 373. The water flowing into the steering
   turbine chamber 373 drives the steering turbine 392 causing it to rotate, which in turn
   rotates the main rotatable member 402 through the compound drive gear 394. The
   water flowing into the steering turbine chamber 373 exits the steering turbine
   chamber 373 through the outlet 406 and into the turbine housing 376 where it is
25 introduced into and mixed with the water flowing through the cleaner 300, e.g., the
   water in the first flow path.
   Again, with reference to FIGS. 19-24, and particularly, FIGS. 19, 20, and 24, as the
   flow of fluid along the second flow path causes the steering turbine 392 to rotate, the
30 rotation of the steering turbine 392 causes the main rotatable member 402 to rotate.
   As detailed above, the main rotatable member 402 is drivingly engaged with both the

   cam drive train 408 and the steering drive train 410. Specifically, the main rotatable
   member 402 drives both the driven gear 412a of the first reduction gear 412, and the
   idler gear 428. Focusing on the cam drive train 408, rotation of the first driven gear
   412a results in conjoint rotation of the first drive gear 412b, which is meshed with and
 5 drives the second driven gear 414a of the second reduction gear 414. Rotation of the
   second driven gear 414a results in conjoint rotation of the second drive gear 414b,
   which is meshed with and drives the third driven gear 416a of the third reduction gear
   416. Rotation of the third driven gear 416a results in conjoint rotation of the third drive
   gear 416b, which is meshed with and drives the cam drive gear 418 of the cam
10 mechanism 380. As such, the third drive gear 416b drivingly rotates the cam drive
   gear 418, which is conjointly engaged with the cam wheel 420. Thus, the third drive
   gear 416b also rotates the cam wheel 420. The cam wheel 420 is biased by the
   spring 442 into engagement with the roller 431, such that the roller 431 rides along
   the perimeter of the cam wheel 420 and is biased radially outward by the outer-profile
15 regions of the cam wheel 420, e.g., the lesser radii region 422, the medium radii
   region 424, and the greater radii region 426. As the cam wheel 420 continues to
   rotate, the roller 431 alternates between engagement the lesser radii region 422, the
   middle radii region 424, and the greater radii region 426 as the regions continuously
   rotate past the roller 431. As discussed in detail above, the roller 431 is engaged and
20 coaxial with a pinion drive gear 430b, which are both mounted on a swivel arm 432.
   Accordingly, engagement of the roller 431 with the different regions of the cam wheel
   420, as shown in FIGS. 25A-25C, will cause the roller 431 and associated pinion
   drive gear 430b to rotate by way of the swivel arm 432. When the roller 431 is
   engaged with the lesser radii region 422 the pinion drive gear 430b is placed in a first
25 position (see FIG. 25A), when the roller 431 is engaged with the middle radii region
   424 the pinion drive gear 430b is placed in a second position (see FIG. 25B), and
   when the roller 431 is engaged with the greater radii region 426 the pinion drive gear
   430b is placed in a third position (see FIG. 25C).
30 The nose cone 320 is positioned over the cam mechanism 380 so that the pinion
   drive gear 430b is placed within the gear track cavity 448 on the underside of the

   C:\Interwon\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16976507_l docx-[ 5 05 2018
                                                            - 38
   nose cone radial plate 446 (see FIGS. 17-19 and 25A-25C). When the pinion drive
   gear 430b is in the first position it meshes with the first (inner) gear track 450 of the
   nose cone 320 (see FIG. 25A), when the pinion drive gear 430b is in the second
   position it is in the center of the gear track cavity 448 and does not mesh with either
 5 the first or second gear track 450, 452 (see FIG. 25B), and when the pinion drive gear
   430b is in the third position it meshes with the second (outer) gear track 452 of the
   nose cone (see FIG. 25C).
   Turning now to operation of the steering drive train 410, and still with reference to
10 FIGS. 19-24, and particularly, FIGS. 20 and 24, the main rotatable member 402 is
   meshed with and drives the idler gear 428 of the steering drive train 410. The idler
   gear 428 drives the driven gear 430a which is in conjoint rotation with the pinion drive
   gear 430b and the roller 431 such that rotation of the driven gear 430a results in
   rotation of the pinion drive gear 430b. Accordingly, rotation of the main rotatable
15 member 402 results in the rotation of the pinion drive gear 430b, which, as described
   above, will be in one of three positions based on the roller's 431 engagement with the
   cam wheel 420. Thus, when in the first position the pinion drive gear 430b rotatably
   drives the inner gear track 450 of the nose cone 320 resulting in the cleaner 300
   being steered to turn clockwise, when in the second position the pinion drive gear
20 430b does not rotatably drive the nose cone 320 resulting in the cleaner 300 traveling
   in a straight/forward direction, and when in the third position the pinion drive gear
   430b rotatably drives the outer gear track 452 of the nose cone 320 resulting in the
   cleaner 300 being steered to turn counter-clockwise.
25 One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the regions 422, 424, 426 of the
   cam wheel 420 can span different angular distances, e.g., have different lengths,
   such that the cleaner 300 can stay in different directions of movement for different
   amounts of time depending on a user's desire.

   present disclosure implemented with various types of suction-type pool cleaners.

   FIG. 26 is a diagrammatic partial sectional view of a steering system 518, which is
   substantially similar to the steering system 318 of FIGS. 16-25C, incorporated into a
   tube-shaped suction cleaner 500 having a horseshoe-shaped oscillator 502. FIG. 27
 5 is a partial sectional view of the suction cleaner 500 showing the steering system 518.
   The steering system 518 is substantially similar in construction and operation to the
   steering system 318 detailed above in connection with FIGS. 16-25C. In describing
   the steering system 518, reference will be made to the counterpart components of the
   steering system 318 as an additional full overview of the functionality and operation
10 need not be provided in view of the detailed description above. Instead, a focus will
   be made on how the steering system of the present disclosure is implemented with
   the tube-shaped suction cleaner 500.
   The driving force of the suction cleaner 500 is shown diagrammatically.
15
   The suction cleaner 500 includes a tubular body 504 defining an internal cavity 506, a
   steering system housing 508, a steering turbine housing 510, and a disc 512.
   The tubular body 504 includes an inlet 514 extending through the disc 512 and into
20 the internal cavity 506, and an outlet 516. The oscillator 502 is mounted on a pivot
   520 in the internal cavity 506 of the tubular body 504. As water is suctioned through
   the internal cavity 506 it flows along the sides of the oscillator 502. This creates a
   pressure differential causing the oscillator 502 to rotate to one side thus blocking one
   of the flow paths. One skilled in the art will appreciate that FIG. 26 is diagrammatic,
25 and that two inner tubes might be provided on each side of the oscillator. The water
   then flows along a single side of the oscillator 502 which generates a pressure
   differential resulting in the oscillator 502 rotating to the other side and blocking that
   flow path. This process continues repeatedly causing the oscillator 502 to oscillate.
   As the oscillator 502 oscillates it "hammers" against the tubular body 504 causing the
30 suction cleaner 500 to incrementally and gradually skip across the pool surface.

   As can be seen in FIGS. 26-27, the steering system 518 includes a steering turbine

10
   With further reference to FIG. 26, the steering turbine assembly 522 is housed in the
   steering turbine housing 510, while the steering drive mechanism 524, the cam
   mechanism 536, and the nose cone 538 is housed in the steering system housing
   508. The turbine housing 510 includes a plurality of inlets 540 and an outlet 542 that
15 is adjacent the internal cavity 506 such that fluid can flow into the steering turbine
   housing 510 through the inlets 540 and out through the outlet 542 into the internal
   cavity 506. The flow of water through the steering turbine housing 510 causes a
   turbine 544 to rotate resulting in the steering turbine assembly 522 rotating the main
   rotatable member 526 (in the same fashion as the turbine 392 and steering turbine
20 assembly 314 of FIG. 20).
   The main rotatable member 526 is operatively engaged with the cam drive train 528
   and the steering drive train 530 such that when the main rotatable member 526
   rotates it drives each of the cam drive train 528 and the steering drive train 530 (each
25 of these components, and engagement therebetween, operates consistently with the
   counter-part component of the steering system 318 of FIG. 20).
   The cam drive train 528 is in turn operatively engaged with the cam mechanism 536
   and rotationally drives the cam mechanism 536 through engagement with a cam drive
30 gear 544 (see cam drive gear 418 of FIG. 20). The cam mechanism 536 further
   includes a cam wheel 546 (see cam wheel 420 of FIG. 20) that is interconnected and

   coaxial with the cam drive gear 544 such that rotation of the cam drive gear 544
   results in rotation of the cam wheel 546. The cam mechanism 536 is positioned about
   the outlet 516 (see FIG. 26) to the cleaner body 504 and rotatably secured with
   respect thereto such that it allows water to flow out from the outlet 516 and through
 5 the cam mechanism 536. The cam wheel 546 is similar in structure to the cam wheel
   224 illustrated in FIG. 9. In accordance therewith, the cam wheel 546 includes outer
   profile regions of greater and lesser radii each corresponding to one of the directions
   of the steering drive mechanism 524. As illustrated in FIG. 9, the cam wheel 546 has
   three outer-profile regions of lesser 548, medium 550, and greater 552 radii each
10 corresponding to one of the steering directions, as discussed in detail above in
   connection with FIGS. 16-25C.
   The steering drive train 530 operatively engages the nose cone 538 and is engaged
   by the cam wheel 546 (see FIG. 9) of the cam mechanism 536. Specifically, the
15 steering drive train 530 includes a driven gear 554a, a pinion drive gear 554b, and a
   roller 555 (see driven gear 430a, pinion drive gear 430b, and roller 431 of FIG. 24),
   which are coaxial with the driven gear 554a and the pinion drive gear 554b having
   conjoint rotation. The roller 555 engages the cam wheel 546 such that the cam wheel
   456 pushes on the roller 555 causing the swivel arm 532 and steering drive train 530
20 mounted thereto to rotate and move into three different positions based on which cam
   wheel region, e.g., lesser radii region 548, medium radii region 550, or greater radii
   region 552 (see FIG. 9), that the roller 555 is engaged with. The steering drive
   mechanism 524 is configured to be placed adjacent to the cam mechanism 536 with
   the pinion drive gear 554b inserted into a gear track cavity 556 (see FIG. 26) of the
25 steering drive mechanism 524. The gear track cavity 556 is defined by a first (inner)
   gear track 558 and a second (outer) gear track 560 (see FIG. 26). The nose cone 538
   further includes a nose 539 that is connected to a hose, which provides a source of
   suction to the cleaner 500.
30 With reference to FIG. 27, rotation of the main rotatable member 526 results in the
   cam drive train 528 and the steering drive train 530 being driven, and, thus, the cam

   wheel 546 rotating and the pinion drive gear 554b rotating. The cam wheel 546
   pushes against the roller 555 causing the pinion drive gear 554b to be placed into one
   of three different positions. In accordance with the above-description, when the roller
   555 is engaged with the lesser radii region 548 (see FIG. 9) of the cam wheel 546,
 5 the pinion drive gear 554b is placed in a first position where it engages and rotatably
   drives the first gear track 558 resulting in the cleaner 500 rotating clockwise about the
   hose. When the roller 555 is engaged with the medium radii region 550 (see FIG. 9)
   of the cam wheel 546, the pinion drive gear 554b is placed in a second position where
   it is between the first and second gear tracks 558, 560 and does not rotatably drive
10 the nose cone 538 resulting in the cleaner 500 traveling in a straight/forward direction.
   When the roller 555 is engaged with the greater radii region 552 (see FIG. 9) of the
   cam wheel 546, the pinion drive gear 554b is placed in a third position where it
   engages and rotatably drives the second gear track 560 resulting in the cleaner 500
   rotating counterclockwise about the hose.

   Turning now to FIGS. 34-56, the cleaner 300, as illustrated in FIG. 16, includes the
   first and second A-frame arm assemblies 304a, 304b and the drive turbine assembly
   306, which form a locomotion system 600 of the present disclosure. FIGS. 34-36
10 illustrate the lower middle body 312 of the cleaner 300 with the locomotion system
   600 installed therein. FIG. 34 is a first top perspective view showing the lower middle
   body 312 and the locomotion system 600 installed therein. FIG. 35 is a second top
   perspective view showing the lower middle body 312 and the locomotion system 600
   installed therein. FIG. 36 is a top view of the lower middle body 312 and the
15 locomotion system 600 installed therein. As discussed above in connection with FIG.
    16, the lower middle body 312 defines the turbine housing 362, first and second
   bushing housings 364a, 364b, and the rear opening 366. The lower middle body 312
   is configured to be placed adjacent the lower body 302. The turbine housing 362 is
   configured for insertion of a portion of the A-frame arms 304a, 304b therein and to
20 house the drive turbine assembly 306 and be in fluidic communication with the inlet
   324 (see FIG. 37) of the lower body 302 such that water flows in through the inlet 324
   and across the drive turbine assembly 306, thereby operatively rotating the drive
   turbine assembly 306. As shown in FIG. 37, the first and second bushing housings
   364a, 364b are positioned on opposite lateral sides of the turbine housing 362 and
25 configured to fixedly engage first and second bushings 630a, 630b of the drive turbine
   assembly 306. The first and second bushing housings 364a, 364b can each include a
   protrusion 365 (see FIG. 37) positioned therein that is configured to engage a notch
   631 of each bushing 630a, 630b (see FIGS. 41 and 42). The rear opening 366 is
   configured to have the screen 368 (see FIG. 16) inserted therein so that water can

   assembly 600 removed showing the A-frame arm assemblies 304a, 304b installed in
 5 the turbine housing 362. As can be seen in FIG. 37, the A-frame arm assemblies
   304a, 304b are housed within the turbine housing 362 and secured by the respective
   pivot shaft 330 to the pivot lower bracket 334 (see FIG. 16) of the lower middle body
   312 by the pivot upper bracket 336. The A-frame arm assemblies 304a, 304b each
   rotated about the respective pivot shaft 330. Operation thereof is discussed in greater
10 detail below.
   FIGS. 38-40 show an A-frame arm assembly 304a of the present disclosure. It should
   be understood that the A-frame arm assemblies 304a, 304b are identical in
   construction, and, accordingly, the reference numerals will be consistent between the
15 A-frame arm assemblies 304a, 304b. FIG. 38 is a perspective view of the A-frame
   arm assembly 304a, 304b. FIG. 39 is a rear view of the A-frame arm assembly 304a,
   304b while FIG. 40 is a side view of the A-frame arm assembly 304a, 304b. The A
   frame arm assembly 304a, 304b includes a body 606 having first and second fingers
   608a, 608b extending therefrom, the pivot shaft 330 extending perpendicular from a
20 first side of a lower portion of the body 606, a square head 356 extending
   perpendicular from a second side of the lower portion of the body 606 opposite the
   pivot shaft 330, and a standoff 610 extending from the body 606 on the same side as
   the square head 356. The pivot shaft 330 and the square head 356 are generally
   coaxial.

   304b mate with the square socket 350 of the respective walking pod assembly 308a,
   308b (see FIG. 16) such that rotation of the square head 356 results in rotation of the
   engaged walking pod assembly 308a, 308b (see FIG. 16). The standoff 610 is
 5 positioned on the A-frame arm assembly body 606 to prevent the body 606 from
   contacting an internal wall of the lower middle body 312. The A-frame arm assemblies
   304a, 304b are configured so that when they are installed in a pool cleaner, that is,
   when the pivot shaft 330 is secured by the upper and lower brackets 334, 336 (see
   FIG. 16) and the square head 356 is engaged with the square socket 350 of the
10 respective walking pod assembly 308a, 308b (see FIG. 16), a portion of the drive
   turbine assembly 306 is placed in the bearing housing 612 of each A-frame arm
   assembly 304a, 304b and engages the straight flat surfaces 616a, 616b of the
   extension plates 614a, 614b (see FIG. 36). The drive turbine assembly 306, when
   partially positioned within the bearing housing 612 of each A-frame arm assembly
15 304a, 304b rotates or rocks the A-frame arm assemblies 304a, 304b about the pivot
   shaft 330, causing the square heads 356 to rotate the respective walking pod
   assembly 308a, 308b that they are engaged with.
   FIGS. 41 -47 illustrate the drive turbine assembly 306 of the present disclosure in
20 greater detail. FIG. 41 is a perspective view of the drive turbine assembly 306 and
   FIG. 42 is an exploded perspective view of the drive turbine assembly 306. The drive
   turbine assembly 306 includes a central hub 618 (see FIG. 42), a plurality of
   removable vanes 620, a first side retention wall 622a, a second side retention wall
   622b, a first eccentric 624a extending from the first side retention wall 622a, a second
25 eccentric 624b (see FIG. 45) extending from the second side retention wall 622b, a
   first bearing 626a positioned about the first eccentric 624a, a second bearing 626b
   positioned about the second eccentric 624b, a shaft 628, a first bushing 630a, and a
   second bushing 630b. FIG. 41 shows the plurality of removable vanes 620 in a
   retracted position. FIG. 43 is a side view of the first side retention wall 622a and the
30 central hub 618, which are interconnected. The central hub 618 includes a central
   opening 632, a plurality of vane edge slots 634, a first hole 636, a second hole 638,

   and a protrusion 640. The vane edge slots 634 are configured to be engaged by and
   secure the removable vanes 620. More specifically, each removable vane 620
   includes a bulbous proximal edge 620a and a distal edge 620b, with the bulbous
   proximal edge 620a being configured and shaped so that it can slide into a vane edge
 5 slot 634 and be secured therein. The bulbous proximal edges 620a and the vane
   edge slots 634 can be sized and shaped so that the proximal edges 620a can only be
   slide in and out of the vane edge slots 634 and cannot be pulled from the vane edge
   slots 634. Further, the bulbous proximal edges 620a and the vane edge slots 634 can
   be shaped to allow rotation of the proximal edges 620a within the vane edge slots
10 634, allowing the vanes 620 to partially rotate when interconnected with the central
   hub 618. The vanes can be secured to the central hub 618 by connecting the second
   side retention wall 622b to the central hub 618, which is described below in
   connection with FIG. 44.
15 FIG. 44 is a side view of the second side retention wall 622b, which includes a central
   opening 641, first protrusion 642, a second protrusion 644, and a hole 646 spaced
   apart at locations to match the spacing of the first hole 636, the second hole 638, and
   the protrusion 640 of the central hub 618, respectively, shown in FIG. 43. That is, the
   first protrusion 642 and the first hole 636 are sized and configured to engage one
20 another, the second protrusion 644 and the second hole 638 are sized and configured
   to engage one another, and the protrusion 640 and the hole 646 are sized and
   configured to engage one another. This relationship allows the second side retention
   wall 622b to be engaged with the central hub 618 such that rotation of the central hub
   618 is transferred to the second side retention wall 622b. Additionally, this connection
25 secures the vanes 620 in the vane edge slots 634 of the central hub 618.
   In connection with FIGS. 41-45, with the vanes 620 secured to the central hub 618,
   and the second side retention wall 622b engaged with the central hub 618, the drive
30 turbine assembly 306 is further constructed whereby the shaft 628, which can be a
   stainless steel shaft, extends through an opening 648a (see FIG. 42) extending

   central opening 632 (see FIG. 43) of the central hub 618, the central opening 641
   (see FIG. 44) of the second side retention wall 622b, and an opening 648b extending
   through the second eccentric 624b (see FIG. 45) (which the second bearing 626b is
 5 secured about). The shaft 628 is engaged on opposite ends thereof by the first
   bushing 630a and the second bushing 630b, thus forming the drive turbine assembly
   306.
   As shown in FIGS. 42 and 45, the first and second bushings 630a, 630b, the shaft
10 628, the first and second side retention walls 622a, 622b, the central hub 618, and
   the vanes 620 are aligned and concentric with a central axis CA, such that axis CA
   extends through the center of these components. However, the first and second
   eccentrics 624a, 624b, and thus the first and second bearings 626a, 626b engaged
   respectively thereto, are eccentric with the axis CA. The first eccentric 624a and the
15 first bearing 626a are aligned with a first eccentric axis El, while the second eccentric
   624b and the second bearing 626b are aligned with a second eccentric axis E2. FIG.
   45 is a bottom elevational view of the drive turbine assembly 306 showing the
   eccentric nature of the first and second eccentrics 624a, 624b and the relationship
   between the CA, El, and E2 axes, as well as the components of the drive turbine
20 assembly 306. As is illustrated in FIG. 45, the first and second eccentrics 624a, 624b,
   and the respective El and E2 axes are spaced evenly from the CA axis but are 180
   degrees out of phase with each other. Accordingly, as the drive turbine assembly 306
   rotates about the CA axis, the El and E2 axes will also rotate about the CA axis, with
   one of the El and E2 axes always on one side of the CA axis and the other one of the
25 El and E2 axes being directly opposite, e.g., 180 degrees out of phase, and on the
   other side of the CA axis. FIG. 46 is another view of the drive turbine assembly 306
   from a front view illustrating that while from one view, e.g., in one plane, the CA, El,
   and E2 axes are not aligned, but in a view perpendicular to that, e.g., in a
   perpendicular plane, the CA, El , and E2 axes are aligned.

   of the offset between the El and E2 axes and the CA axis is provided herein where
   the drive turbine assembly 306 is engaged with the first and second A-frame arms
 5 304a, 304b, as illustrated in FIGS. 36 and 48.
   FIG. 48 is a front view of the drive turbine assembly 306 engaged with first and
   second A-frame arms 304a, 304b such that the first and second bearings 626a, 626b
   are positioned within the bearing housing 612 (see FIGS. 38 and 49) of the respective
10 first and second A-frame arm 304a, 304b. FIG. 49 is a partial sectional view of the
   drive turbine assembly 306 engaged with first and second A-frame arms 304a, 304b
   taken along line 49-49 of FIG. 48. As can be seen in FIG. 49, the second bearing
   626b is positioned within the bearing housing 612 of the second A-frame arm 304b
   and is in contact with the extension plates 614a, 614b of the second A-frame arm
15 304b. Additionally, FIG. 49 illustrates the eccentricity between the E2 axis and the CA
   axis. As discussed above, the CA axis extends through the center of the shaft 628,
   the central hub 618, and the first and second bushings 630a, 630b, which are
   respectively secured in the first and second bushing housings 364a, 364b of the lower
   middle body 312, and thus, the CA axis is fixed in place. Additionally, as discussed
20 above, the first and second bushing housings 364a, 364b can each include a
   protrusion 365 (see FIG. 37) positioned therein that is configured to engage a notch
   631 of each bushing 630a, 630b (see FIGS. 41 and 42). The engagement between
   the respective notch 631 and protrusion 365 further secure the bushings 630a, 630b
   in the respective bushing housing 364a, 364b and limit rotation thereof. One of
25 ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that, in the alternative, the bushings 630a,
   630b can include a protrusion while the respective bushing housings 364a, 364b
   include a notch that receives a respective protrusion. Additionally, the bushing
   housings 364a, 364b and the bushings 630a, 630b can include complementary
   geometries that mate such that only a bushing 630a, 630b having the appropriate
30 geometry will fit within the respective bushing housing 364a, 364b, and will be
   restrained from rotation by the bushing housing 364a, 364b when inserted therein.

   Being that the CA axis is fixed in place, rotation of the drive turbine assembly 306
   results in rotation of the El axis and E2 axis about the fixed CA axis. As such, when
   the E2 axis is in the position illustrated in FIG. 49, e.g., laterally to the side of the CA
   axis, the second A-frame arm 304b is biased and slightly rotated about the pivot shaft
 5 330 through engagement of the second bearing 626b with the first extension plate
   614a of the second A-frame arm second finger 608a, which is why it is shown as tilted
   to the right in FIG. 49. It should therefore be understood that since the first bearing
   626a is 180 degrees out of phase from the second bearing 626b, the first bearing
   626a pushes the first A-frame arm 304a, which it is engaged with, in the opposite
10 direction causing the first A-frame arm 304a to slightly rotate about the pivot shaft 330
   in the opposite direction to the rotation of the second A-frame arm 304b. This is
   further illustrated in FIG. 36, which shows that when the first A-frame arm 304a is
   rotated and tilted in a first direction, the second A-frame arm 304b is rotated and tilted
   in the opposite direction.
15
   Additionally, as discussed above, the square head 356 of each A-frame arm 304a,
   304b is drivingly engaged with a walking pod assembly 308a, 308b (see FIG. 16).
   Accordingly, as the first and second A-frame arms 304a, 304b are rotated in opposite
   directions, the walking pod assemblies 308a, 308b are in turn rotated in opposite
20 directions. More specifically, if the first A-frame arm 304a is rotated in a first direction
   then the first walking pod assembly 308a will be rotated in the first direction such that,
   for example, the front of the first walking pod assembly 308a will be rotated generally
   downward toward the pool surface while the rear of the first walking pod assembly
   308a will be rotated generally upward and away from the pool surface; in contrast, the
25 second A-frame arm 304b will be rotated in a second direction opposite the first
   direction resulting in the second walking pod assembly 308b being rotated in the
   second direction such that, for example, the front of the second walking pod assembly
   308b is rotated generally upward and away from the pool surface while the rear of the
   second walking pod assembly 308b will be rotated generally downward and toward
30 the pool surface, which is opposite to the first walking pod assembly 308a. This
   alternating movement between the first and second walking pod assemblies 308a,

   308b results in motion of the cleaner 300.
   FIGS. 50A-D illustrate the second bearing 626b and the second A-frame arm
   assembly 304b in four different positions based upon the location of the E2 axis with
 5 respect to the CA axis. Note that the El axis is also provided in FIGS. 50A-D for
   convenience even though the first bearing 626a and first A-frame arm assembly 304a
   are not shown.
   As the drive turbine assembly 306 rotates counter-clockwise about the shaft 628, and
10 the CA axis, the El and E2 axes also rotate about the shaft 628 and the CA axis
   because of the engagement between the first and second eccentrics 624a, 624b and
   the central hub 618 by way of the first and second side retention walls 622a, 622b.
   The rotation of the El and E2 axes about the CA axis causes the first and second
   bearings 626a, 626b push and therefore rotate the respective first and second A
15 frame arm assembly 304a, 304b. This occurs because the El axis is always kept in
   the center of, e.g., equidistant from, the first and second fingers 608a, 608b of the first
   A-frame arm assembly 304a and the E2 axis is always kept in the center of, e.g.,
   equidistant from, the first and second fingers 608a, 608b of the second A-frame arm
   assembly 304b, while the CA axis is kept at a static location because of the
20 engagement of the bushings 630a, 630b with the bushing housings 364a, 364b (see
   FIG. 36). Thus, the amount that the first and second A-frame arm assemblies 304a,
   304b are rotated is directly related to the distance that the El and E2 axes are offset,
   or spaced from, the CA axis. FIGS. 50A-50D illustrate this motion.
25 FIG. 50A shows the second bearing 626b and the second A-frame arm assembly
   304b in a first position. In the first position, the El , CA, and E2 axes are in
   substantial vertical alignment, with the El axis being below the E2 axis. Because of
   this alignment, the CA axis is equidistant from both extension plates 614a, 614b of
   the second A-frame arm assembly 304b resulting in the second A-frame arm
30 assembly 304b being in a vertical position where it is not tilted.

   As the drive turbine assembly 306 rotates counter-clockwise the A-frame arm
   assemblies 304a, 304b are transferred to the next position. FIG. 50B shows the
   second bearing 626b and the second A-frame arm assembly 304b in a second
   position. In the second position, the El, CA, and E2 axes are in substantial horizontal
 5 alignment. Because of this alignment, the CA axis is closer to the first extension plate
   614a of the second A-frame arm assembly 304b resulting in the second bearing 626b
   pushing against the second extension plate 614b, and thus causing the second A
   frame arm assembly 304b to rotate counter-clockwise (as per this view point) about
   the pivot 330, and thus tilted to the left (as per this view point).
10
   Continued rotation of the drive turbine assembly 306 counter-clockwise results in the
   A-frame arm assemblies 304a, 304b being transferred to the next position. FIG. 50C
   shows the second bearing 626b and the second A-frame arm assembly 304b in a
   third position. In the third position, the El , CA, and E2 axes are in substantial vertical
15 alignment, similar to the first position, but with the El axis above the E2 axis.
   Because of this alignment, the CA axis is equidistant from both extension plates
   614a, 614b of the second A-frame arm assembly 304b resulting in the second A
   frame arm assembly 304b being in a vertical position where it is not tilted.
20 Further rotation of the drive turbine assembly 306 counter-clockwise results in the A
   frame arm assemblies 304a, 304b being transferred to the next position. FIG. 50D
   shows the second bearing 626b and the second A-frame arm assembly 304b in a
   fourth position. In the fourth position, the El , CA, and E2 axes are in substantial
   horizontal alignment. Because of this alignment, the CA axis is closer to the second
25 extension plate 614b of the second A-frame arm assembly 304b resulting in the
   second bearing 626b pushing against the first extension plate 614a, and thus causing
   the second A-frame arm assembly 204b to rotate clockwise (as per this view point)
   about the pivot 330, and thus tilted to the right (as per this view point). Continued
   rotation of the drive turbine assembly 306 from the fourth position will bring the A
30 frame arm assemblies 304a, 304b back to the first position illustrated in FIG. 50A.

   FIGS. 51 -52 illustrate an alternative embodiment of the locomotion system 600 of the
   present disclosure. Particularly, FIG. 51 is a side view of the drive turbine assembly
   306 including a fixed vane turbine 652, and in engagement with first and second A
   frame arm assemblies 304a, 304b. FIG. 52 is a sectional view of the drive turbine
 5 assembly 306 of FIG. 51 taken along line 52-52 of FIG. 51. The drive turbine
   assembly 306 and A-frame arm assemblies 304a, 304b of FIGS. 51 -52 are generally
   the same as previously discussed, but with the fixed vane turbine 652 replacing the
   central hub 618, the removable vanes 620, and the side retention walls 622a, 622b.

   partial-sectional view of the locomotion system 600 and portion of the cleaner 300 of
15 FIG. 36 in partial section taken along line 54-54 of FIG. 36 and showing the second
   A-frame arm assembly 304b. FIGS. 53 and 54 illustrate the position that each of the
   first and second A-frame arm assemblies 304a, 304b are in at the same point in time
   during operation of the cleaner 300. As shown in FIGS. 53-54, the locomotion system
   600 is integrated with the cleaner 300 such that it is housed within the turbine housing
20 362. As water is suctioned through the cleaner 300, water is drawn through the inlet
   324 and into the turbine housing 362. The water being pulled through the turbine
   housing 362 engages the vanes 620 of the drive turbine assembly 306, causing the
   drive turbine assembly 306 to rotate about the shaft 628. As described in detail
   above, this results in the El axis (FIG. 53) and the E2 axis (FIG. 54) rotating about
25 the CA axis of the shaft 628 and rocking the first and second A-frame arm assemblies
   304a, 304b back and
   forth. In the specific position of FIGS. 53 and 54, which is the second position
   illustrated in FIG. 50B, the first A-frame arm assembly 304a is rotated about the pivot
30 330 generally toward the front of the cleaner 300 (see FIG. 53), while the second A
   frame arm assembly 304b is rotated about the pivot 330 generally toward the rear of

   the cleaner 300 (see FIG. 54). That is, the first and second A-frame arm assemblies
   304a, 304b are rotated in opposite directions. This results in, as discussed in detail
   above, the first and second walking pods 308a, 308b being rotated in opposite
   directions, e.g., the motion of the A-frame arm assemblies 304a, 304b is imparted to
 5 the connected first and second walking pods 308a, 308b, respectively. The motion of
   the first and second walking pods 308a, 308b results in locomotion of the cleaner 300
   in the direction of arrow A.
   FIG. 55 is a diagrammatic partial-sectional view showing the A-frame arm assemblies
10 304a, 304b and an alternative embodiment of the drive turbine assembly 306 of the
   present disclosure incorporated into a cleaner 700. It should be appreciated by one of
   ordinary skill in the art that the drive turbine assembly 306 need not include the side
   retention walls 622a, 622b as illustrated in, for example, FIGS. 41 and 42. Instead,
   the drive turbine assembly 306, and the first and second A-frame arm assemblies
15 304a, 304b, can be utilized in a cleaner 700 that includes a body 702 having first and
   second retention walls 704a, 704b. Specifically, the first and second retention walls
   704a, 704b extend inwardly from the cleaner body 702 and the turbine vanes 620 and
   central hub 618 are placed between the first and second retention walls 704a, 704b.
   Further, the first and second retention walls 704a, 704b each include an opening
20 706a, 706b that respectively receive the first and second eccentrics 624a, 624b such
   that the eccentrics 624a, 624b can rotate within the openings 706a, 706b. In such a
   configuration, the first and second retention walls 704a, 704b prevent the vanes 620
   from sliding out of, and disengaging, the central hub 618.
25 FIGS. 56A-56C are partial sectional views of a self-adjusting frame assembly 800 of
   the present disclosure showing the self-adjusting frame assembly 800 in three
   positions. The self-adjusting frame assembly 800 is an apparatus that can be
   implemented in a cleaner to engage and rotate walking pod assemblies (e.g., walking
   pod assemblies 308a, 308b of FIG. 16) and thus generate locomotion of the cleaner.
30 Generally, the self-adjusting frame assembly 800 would replace each of the A-frame
   arm assemblies 304a, 304b discussed above in connection with FIGS. 34-54. FIG.

   56A shows the self-adjusting frame assembly 800 in a first position. The self-adjusting
   frame assembly 800 includes a frame 804 and a crank 806 having a crank axis of
   rotation C. The frame 804 includes a shaft 808, and a frame body 810. The frame
   body 810 includes an internal bore 812 and a central opening 814. A bearing 816 is
 5 positioned within the central opening 814 such that the bearing rotates within the
   central opening 814 about a bearing axis B, which is at the center of the bearing 816
   and at the center of the central opening 814. The crank 806 is engaged with the
   bearing 816 at a point offset from axis B and rotates about a crank axis C. The crank
   806 can be rotatably connected with a turbine, horseshoe-shaped oscillator, or
10 hammer oscillator (not shown) such that the crank 806 is rotatably driven by anyone
   of these devices. The crank 806 is generally eccentric and fixed in place so that it
   does not move vertically or horizontally.
   A first end 808a of the shaft 808 is connected with a pivot 818 and a second end
15 808b of the shaft 808 is inserted into the internal bore 812 of the frame body 810. The
   shaft 808 and the internal bore 812 are sized and configured so that the shaft 808 can
   slide into the internal bore 812 in a piston-like motion. The frame 804 is configured to
   rotate the pivot 818 while the pivot 818 is constrained from moving laterally and
   vertically.
20
    In operation, as the crank 806 rotates, the crank 806 forces the bearing 816, and axis
   B thereof, to rotate about axis C. Because the crank 806 is fixed, this results in the
   bearing 816 rotating within the central opening 814 of the frame body 810 and
   pushing the frame body 810 laterally and vertically. The lateral movement causes the
25 frame body 810 to rotate the shaft 808 at the pivot 818 (see FIG. 56B), while the
   vertical movement causes the frame body 810 to further engage the shaft 808 such
   that the shaft 808 is inserted further into the internal bore 812. FIG. 56B shows the
   self
30 adjusting frame assembly 800 in a second position where the bearing 816 and axis B
   have been rotated counter-clockwise about the crank 806 and axis C resulting in the

   frame body 810 being moved laterally and vertically. This lateral and vertical
   movement of the frame body 810 results in the shaft 808 partially rotating the pivot
   818 and being further inserted into the internal bore 812.
 5 FIG. 56C shows the self-adjusting frame assembly 800 in a third position where the
   bearing 816 and axis B have been further rotated counter-clockwise about the crank
   806 and axis C resulting in the frame being further moved laterally and vertically. This
   lateral and vertical movement of the frame body 810 results in the shaft 808 partially
   rotating the pivot 818 and being fully inserted into the internal bore 812.
10
   As the crank 806 continually rotates, this movement is repeated continuously, causing
   the shaft 808 and pivot 818 to rotate back and forth. The pivot 818 can be connected
   with a keyed shaft that can extend to a walking pod, such as walking pods 308a,
   308b, or other mode of locomotion (not shown) such that the pivot 818 can rotate the
15 mode of locomotion and otherwise drive it. For example, the self-adjusting frame
   assembly 800 could be implemented in the suction cleaner 300 of FIG. 16. In this
   regard, two self-adjusting frame assemblies 800 could be implemented with each
   being connected to a respective walking pod.
20 FIGS. 57, 57A, 57B, 58A, and 58B illustrate alternative apparatuses for connection
   with the walking pod assemblies of a cleaner, such as walking pod assemblies 308a,
   308b of FIG. 16, to rotate the walking pod assemblies and generate locomotion of the
   associated cleaner. For example, FIGS. 57, 57A, 57B, 58A, and 58B illustrate an
   alternative oscillator locomotion system 900 of the present disclosure that could be
25 implemented in place of the locomotion system 600 of FIG. 34, including the A-frame
   arm assemblies 304a, 304b and drive turbine assembly 306. FIG. 57 is a partial side

   first and second gear frames 904a, 904b respectively engaged with first and second

   skill in the art that such description will hold true for and also apply to FIGS. 58A and
   58B.
   FIG. 57A is a first side view of the oscillator 902, first gear frame 904a, and first
10 rotatable component 906a. FIG. 57B is a second side view of the oscillator 902,
   second gear frame 904b, and second rotatable component 906b. The oscillator 902 is
   positioned between first and second walls 908a, 908b of a pool cleaner that define a
   chamber 910 that water flows through. The chamber 910 can be similar to a turbine
   chamber, such as the turbine chamber 362 of the pool cleaner 300 of FIG. 16. The
15 oscillator 902 is mounted to a shaft 912 that extends across the oscillator 902 and
   through the first and second walls 908a, 908b. The shaft 912 can be mounted to the
   first and second walls 908a, 908b by first and second bearings 914a, 914b that allow
   the shaft 912 to rotate. The shaft 912 can be further secured with a proximal end
   916a, 916b of the first and second gear frames 904a, 904b. Accordingly, the oscillator
20 902, shaft 912, and first and second gear frames 904a, 904b are all rotationally
   secured to each other such that rotation of the oscillator 902 results in rotation of the
   shaft 912 and the first and second gear frames 904a, 904b.
   The first gear frame 904a can include the proximal end 916a and a distal end 918a
25 that includes a toothed surface 920. The toothed surface 920 is configured to engage
   a toothed gear 922a of the first rotatable component 906a. The toothed surface 920
   engages the toothed gear 922a in an "overhand" fashion such that clockwise rotation
   of the toothed surface 920 results in counter-clockwise rotation of the toothed gear
   922a while counter-clockwise rotation of the toothed surface 920 results in clockwise

   The second gear frame 904b can include the proximal end 916b and a distal end
   918b that has a sickle-like shape including an interior toothed surface 924. The
   interior toothed surface 924 is configured to engage a toothed gear 922b of the
   second rotatable component 906b. The toothed surface 924 engages the toothed
 5 gear 922b in an "underhand" fashion such that clockwise rotation of the toothed
   surface 924 results in clockwise rotation of the toothed gear 922b while counter
   clockwise rotation of the toothed surface 924 results in counter-clockwise rotation of
   the toothed gear 922b.
10 The first and second rotatable components 906a, 906b can be mounted to the first
   and second walls 908a, 908b by a respective bearing 926a, 926b such that the first
   and second rotatable components 906a, 906b can rotate. The first and second
   rotatable components 906a, 906b can also each include a shaped head 928a, 928b
   extending therefrom that is connected with a means for motion of a pool cleaner such
15 as a walking pod or other mode of locomotion (not shown) such that the shaped
   heads 928a, 928b can rotate the mode of locomotion and otherwise drive it. For
   example, the oscillator locomotion system 900 could be implemented in the suction
   cleaner 300 of FIG. 16. In this regard, the shaped head 928a, 928b of each
   respective first and second rotatable components 906a, 906b could be connected to a
20 respective walking pod.
    In operation, water flowing through the chamber 910 would cause the oscillator 902 to
   oscillate back and forth within the chamber 910. This oscillation would in turn cause
   the first and second gear frames 904a, 904b to oscillate back and forth. During this
25 oscillation, the first gear frame 904a would rotatably drive the first rotatable member
   906a in a first rotational direction as the second gear frame 904b rotatably drives the
   second rotatable member 906b in an opposite rotational direction. Accordingly, the
   first shaped head 928a would rotate an associated gear pod or other mode of
   locomotion in the first rotational direction, while the second shaped head 928b would
30 rotate an associated gear pod or other mode of locomotion in an opposite rotational
   direction. This opposed rotation would result in the movement of a pool or spa

   FIGS. 59-65 illustrate an alternative oscillator locomotion system 1000 of the present
   disclosure that can be utilized in a suction cleaner such as the suction cleaner 300 of
 5 FIG. 16. The oscillator locomotion system 1000 could be connected with the walking
   pod assemblies of a cleaner, such as walking pod assemblies 308a, 308b of FIG. 16,
   to rotate the walking pod assemblies and generate locomotion of the associated
   cleaner. For example, the alternative oscillator locomotion system 1000 of the present
   disclosure could be implemented in place of the locomotion system 600 of FIG. 34,
10 including the A-frame arm assemblies 304a, 304b and drive turbine assembly 306.
   FIG. 59 is a partial side view of the oscillator locomotion system 1000 which includes
   an oscillator 1002 driving first and second A-frame assemblies 1004a, 1004b. FIGS.
   60-62 are first, second, and third side views of the oscillator locomotion system 1000
   showing a first embodiment of the oscillator 1002 having a horseshoe-shaped
15 configuration 1002a. FIG. 65 is a side view of the oscillator locomotion system 1000
   showing a second embodiment of the oscillator 1002 having a hammer configuration
    1002b. The operation and functionality of the oscillator locomotion system 1000 is
   consistent between each of FIGS. 59-65, and description of the system 1000 will be
   made only in connection with FIGS. 59-64, and it should be understood by one of
20 ordinary skill in the art that such description will hold true for and also apply to FIG.
   65.
   A shaft 1006 extends through the oscillator 1002 and includes a central axis A that
   the oscillator 1002 rotates about. The shaft 1006 can be similar in construction to the
25 shaft 628 discussed in connection with the drive turbine assembly 306 of FIG. 42. In
   accordance therewith, the shaft 628 can be connected on lateral ends thereof with
   first and second bushings (not shown) such that the shaft can be secured within a
   pool cleaner house and prevented from moving laterally. The oscillator 1002 can
   include first and second cams 1008a, 1008b extending laterally from the sides
30 thereof. The first and second cams 1008a, 1008b are eccentric with the axis of
   rotation of the oscillator 1002, e.g., axis A. Specifically, the first cam 1008a has a

   central axis C1 and the second cam 1008b has a central axis C2. The first and
   second cams 1008a, 1008b are integral with the oscillator 1002 such that they rotate
   with the oscillator 1002.
 5 The first and second A-frame arm assemblies 1004a, 1004b are substantially similar
   to the A-frame arm assemblies 304a, 304b discussed in connection with FIGS. 38-40.
   It should be understood that the A-frame arm assemblies 1004a, 1004b are identical
   in construction, and, accordingly, the reference numerals will be consistent between
   the A-frame arm assemblies 1004a, 1004b. The A-frame arm assembly 1004a, 1004b
10 includes a body 1010 having first and second fingers 1012a, 1012b extending
   therefrom, a pivot shaft 1014 extending perpendicular from a first side of a lower
   portion of the body 1010, and a square head 1016 extending perpendicular from a
   second side of the lower portion of the body 1010 opposite the pivot shaft 1014. The
   pivot shaft 1014 and the square head 1016 are generally coaxial.
15
   The first and second fingers 1012a, 1012b define a cam housing 1018 and each
   include a respective extension plate 1020a, 1020b. The pivot shaft 1014 is configured
   to be secured to a cleaner, such as by the pivot upper and lower brackets 334, 336 of
   the cleaner 300 of FIG. 16, while the square head 1016 is configured to extend to the
20 exterior of the cleaner and engage a mode of locomotion such as the walking pod
   assembly 308a, 308b of FIG. 16. The square heads 1016 of the A-frame arm
   assemblies 1004a, 1004b mate with a square socket of the respective walking pod
   assembly such that rotation of the square head 1016 results in rotation of the
   engaged walking pod assembly.
25
   The A-frame arm assemblies 1004a, 1004b are configured so that when they are
   installed in a pool cleaner the first cam 1008a can be placed in the cam housing 1018
   of the first A-frame arm assembly 1004a and the second cam 1008b can be placed in
   the cam housing 1018 of the second A-frame arm assembly 1004b, each engaging
30 the extension plates 1020a, 1020b of the respective A-frame arm assembly 1004a,
   1004b. The oscillator 1002, and particularly the cams 1008a, 1008b, when positioned

   within the cam housing 1018 of each A-frame arm assembly 1004a, 1004b rotate or
   rock the A-frame arm assemblies 1004a, 1004b at the pivot shaft 1014, causing the
   square heads 1016 to rotate the respective walking pod assembly that they are
   engaged with.
 5
   This motion of the A-frame arm assemblies 1004a, 1004b is achieved through
   engagement of each cam 1008a, 1008b with the A-frame arm assembly 1004a,
    1004b that it is engaged with. Specifically, as the oscillator 1002 oscillates, which
   occurs when water is suctioned past it, it rotates about the shaft 1006 and axis A,
10 thus causing the cams 1008a, 1008b, and associated axes C1 and C2, to rotate
   about axis A. The rotation of the cams 1008a, 1008b results in the cams 1008a,
    1008b "pushing" the A-frame arm assemblies 1004a, 1004b and causing them to
   rotate. This motion is shown in connection with FIGS. 60-64.
15 FIG. 60 illustrates the position of the oscillator 1002, first A-frame arm 1004a, first
   cam 1008a, and second cam 1008b when there is no rotation of the oscillator 1002,
   e.g., a neutral position. As can be seen, the A axis, the C1 axis, and the C2 axis are
   substantially aligned vertically and the first A-frame arm 1004a is not rotated.
20 FIG. 61 illustrates the position of the oscillator 1002, first A-frame arm 1004a, first
   cam 1008a, and second cam 1008b when the oscillator 1002, and interconnected
   cams 1008a, 1008b, are rotated counter-clockwise about axis A. Here, it can be seen
   that the axis C1 is now located slightly to the right of axis A while axis C2 is now
   located slightly to the left of axis A. Due to the shape of the cams 1008a, 1008b, this
25 rotation of the oscillator 1002 and interconnected cams 1008a, 1008b results in the
   first cam 1008a pushing the first A-frame arm assembly 1004a to the right (clockwise
   rotation) (see FIG. 63 which shows this engagement in closer detail) and the second
   cam 1008b pushing the second A-frame arm assembly 1004b to the left (counter
   clockwise rotation) (see FIG. 64 which shows this engagement in closer detail).
30 Further, this opposing rotation of the A-frame arm assemblies 1004a, 1004b results in
   opposing rotation of the respective square heads 1016 thereof. Accordingly, the mode

   of locomotion connected to each square head 1016, e.g., foot pods, will be rotated in
   opposite directions.
   FIG. 62 illustrates the position of the oscillator 1002, first A-frame arm 1004a, first
 5 cam 1008a, and second cam 1008b when the oscillator 1002, and interconnected
   cams 1008a, 1008b, are rotated clockwise about axis A. Here, it can be seen that the
   axis C1 is now located slightly to the left of axis A while axis C2 is now located slightly
   to the right of axis A. Due to the shape of the cams 1008a, 1008b, this rotation of the
   oscillator 1002 and interconnected cams 1008a, 1008b results in the first cam 1008a
10 pushing the first A-frame arm assembly 1004a to the left (counter-clockwise rotation)
   and the second cam 1008b pushing the second A-frame arm assembly 1004b to the
   right (clockwise rotation). Further, this opposing rotation of the A-frame arm
   assemblies 1004a, 1004b results in opposing rotation of the respective square heads
    1016 thereof. Accordingly, the mode of locomotion connected to each square head
15  1016, e.g., foot pods, will be rotated in opposite directions.
   As the oscillator locomotion system 1000 continuously oscillates between the
   positions of FIGS. 60-62 the mode of locomotion, e.g., foot pods, connected to the A
   frame arm assemblies 1004a, 1004b will continuously rock back and forth resulting in
20 motion of the pool cleaner that the oscillator locomotion system 1000 is integrated
   into.
   Some embodiments of the present disclosure include a pair of A-frames supporting
   the turbine. Each improved A-frame has a large opening and two straight long
25 surfaces. In such embodiments, the turbine consists of two opposing eccentrics which
   retain two large bearings. The two large bearings remain in contact with the straight
   surfaces throughout operation of the cleaner. Such constant contact improves
   durability and a smoother functioning of the cleaner. The large bearings may be
   selected to also have a greater resistance to wear and tear due to the rolling action in
30 comparison to knocking action of some prior A-frame arrangements.

   Each of the improved A-frame arm assemblies and drive turbine assemblies
   discussed in detail above can be implemented with many pool cleaners that are
   currently on the market. For example, each of these improved A-frame arm
   assemblies and drive turbine assemblies can be added to, or substitute for parts in,
 5 known pool cleaners, such as those manufactured and produced by Hayward
    Industries, Inc. under the name Pool Vac, Navigator@, AquaBug@, AquaDroid@, and
   Pool Vac Ultra @.
   While the principles of the disclosure have been shown and described in connection
10 with specific embodiments, it is to be understood that such embodiments are by way
   of example and are not limiting.
   Generally, pool and spa cleaners, such as pressure cleaners, include a source of
   pressurized fluid that is provided to the cleaner. This source of pressurized fluid is
15 discharged through a nozzle as a venturi jet adjacent a bottom inlet of the cleaner to
   produce a suction effect at the inlet and pull water and debris into the cleaner through
   the inlet. The venturi jet will also often be directed to an internal turbine of the cleaner.
   FIG. 66 shows a fragmentary cross-sectional top plan view of a prior art turbine 1100
20 having a plurality of vanes 1102 having a profile which is substantially as wide as
   corresponding dimension of the flow-path 1104 cross-section. In such prior turbine
    1100 configurations, especially in pressure-type cleaners, a venturi jet exits an inlet
   nozzle at a high-velocity flow. The venturi-jet velocity/speed of the water flow is
   reduced due to working contact or friction with the turbine vanes 1102, which fill
25 substantially the entire width of the water-flow chamber 1104. Because of such a
   reduction in the speed of the water flow from the venturi jet into the turbine 1100 the
   venturi jet creates lesser venturi suction across the debris inlet than venturi suction
   which would be created at the high-velocity flow of the venturi jet at the venturi
   nozzle. Therefore, the reduced venturi suction is less effective in removing debris
30 from the pool surface.

    In some of such prior art embodiments of FIG. 66, the vane 1102 is configured such
   that the flow-path 1104 cross-section includes a lateral open region 1106 adjacent to
   at least one of the lateral edges 1108 of the vane 1102. Such lateral open region
    1106 permits unobstructed water flow beside the vane lateral edges 1108 to facilitate
 5 debris-removing efficiency of the cleaner.
    In contrast to the prior art of FIG. 66, FIGS. 67-90 illustrate vanes and turbines of the
   present disclosure. FIG. 67 is a diagrammatic partial-sectional view of a turbine 1112
   of the present disclosure incorporated into a turbine chamber 1110 of suction cleaner
10 and showing operation thereof. The suction cleaner includes a venturijet nozzle 1114
   and debris inlet 1116. FIGS.68-70 illustrate one example of a vane 1118 which has a
   V-shaped vane profile 1120 (e.g., the profile of the vane wall) such that the venturi jet
   flow from the nozzle 1114 engages such V-shaped vane profile 1120 along the
   central region of the vane 1118. Such vane-wall configuration narrowed at the
15 proximal end 1122 allows for two outer jet flow streams to flow at an uninterrupted
   high-velocity flow speed. This significantly increases venturi suction across the debris
   inlet 1116 as compared to the prior configuration of the vane wall (seen in FIG. 66).
   Therefore, the improved configuration of the vane 1118 improves efficiency of the
   pool cleaner in removing debris from the pool surfaces.
20
   FIG.68 is a sectional view of the turbine chamber 1110 and venturi jet nozzle 1114
   taken along line 68-68 of FIG.67 showing the turbine 1112 and associated vanes
   1118 in more detail. FIG.69 is a perspective view of the vane 1118 and FIG.70 is an
   elevational view of the vane 1118. The vane 1118 includes the proximal end 1122
25 and a distal end 1124 with the vane profile 1120 extending from the proximal end
   1122 to the distal end 1124. The proximal end 1122 is connected with a mounting
   shaft (elongate inner member) 1126 that facilitates connection of the vane 1118 to a
   turbine central hub (rotor) 1128. The proximal end 1122 of the vane 1118 is generally
   more narrow than the distal end 1124 such that the vane profile 1120 is wider at the
30 distal end 1124 than at the proximal end 1122, thus forming a V-shape. The V-shape
   of the vane profile 1120, as discussed above, allows for two outer jet flow streams to

   flow on lateral sides of the vane 1118. For example, as shown in FIG.68, when the
   turbine 1112 and associated vanes 1118 are mounted in the turbine chamber 1110
   an open flow path 1130 is formed between the distal end 1124 of the vanes 1118 and
   a wall 1132 of the turbine chamber 1110, which allows for fluid and debris to flow past
 5 in a similar fashion to that of the prior art shown in FIG.66. However, the vanes 1118,
   due to their V-shape, also allow for two outer jet flow streams 11 34a, 11 34b to form
   between the distal end 1124 and the proximal end 1122 of each vane 1118. These
   additional jet flow streams increase the overall flow speed of the fluid through the
   turbine chamber 1110, thus increasing the venturi suction generated at the debris
10 inlet 1116, compared to the prior art and allow for additional regions that debris can
   flow through.
    In certain embodiments, the cleaner is a pressure cleaner with which includes a
   venturi jet fed by a remote pump. The venturi jet is configured and positioned to direct
15 a jet of water across the inlet port 1116 and against the vane(s) 1118 to facilitate
   suction into the inlet port 1116. In some of such embodiments, at least a portion of the
   vane profile is narrower than the axial dimension of the venturi jet.
    In some examples, the vane profile has an axial dimension which at its narrowest is
20 no more than about two-thirds of the axial dimension of the flow-path cross-section at
   that position.
   The vane profile may be substantially symmetrical and centrally positioned within the
   flow-path cross-section such that the venturi-jet is centered with respect thereto. In
25 certain of such embodiments, the vane profile has an axial dimension which at its
   narrowest is no more than about two-thirds of the axial dimension of the flow-path
   cross-section at that position. The vane profile at the proximal edge 1122 may be
   narrower than the axial dimension of the venturi jet.
30 In some embodiments, the proximal edge 1122 of the vane 1118 is pivotally
   connected to the rotor 1128 via a vane-rotor interconnection. One of the rotor 1128

   and vane proximal edge 1122 defines an axially-parallel slotted cavity 1136 which
   receives an axially-parallel elongate inner member 1126 formed by the other of the
   rotor 1128 and vane proximal edge 1122.
 5 Such vane-rotor interconnection is constantly under stress of fine grit and debris
   getting into the cavity and locking the pivotal movement of the vane.
   FIG. 71 is an elevational view of the interconnection between a plurality of vanes
   1118 and a rotor 1128. FIG. 71 illustrates another aspect of the present disclosure in
10 which the slotted cavity 1136 and the elongate inner member 1126 may have non
   congruent shapes that form at least one hollow space 1138 therebetween. Such
   hollow space(s) 1138 facilitate washing out of debris from within the interconnection.
   Such configuration minimizes locking of pivotal movement of the vane 1118 with
   respect to the rotor 1128.

   FIGS. 71A-71 P illustrate alternative embodiments or shapes of the interconnection
   between the vane 1118 and the rotor 1128. FIGS. 71 A-71P are shown
   diagrammatically and one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that these are
   side elevational views of the alternative vane 1118 and rotor 1128 interconnections.
20 In some examples of such embodiments, such as those illustrated in FIGS. 71 C,
   71 D, and 79P, at least one of the inner member 1126C, 1126D, 1126P and slotted
   cavity 1136C, 1136D, 1136P is of a substantially polygonal cross-section. In
   alternative examples shown in FIGS. 71A, 71 B, 71 E, at least one of the inner member
   1126A, 1126B, 1126E and slotted cavity 1136A, 136B, 1136E is of an irregular
25 shaped cross-section. In certain embodiments, the rotor 1128 defines the slotted
   cavity 1136A-1136P and the vane proximal edge is the elongate inner member
   1126A-1126P.

   1214b respectively include a plurality of internal surfaces 1216a, 1216b that generally
15 parallel to the planar shaft surfaces 1210 (see FIGS. 72 and 76). First and second
   continuous tracks 1218a, 1218b are defined by the first and second hexagonal cuffs
   1214a, 1214b between the internal surfaces 1216a, 1216b thereof and the planar
   shaft surfaces 1210 (see FIGS. 72 and 76). The center of each shaft surface 1210
   includes a protrusion 1220 extending perpendicularly therefrom.
20
   In some embodiments such as that shown in FIGS. 72-78, the rotor 1202 includes a
   rotor shaft 1208 on the rotor axis. The rotor shaft 1208 has a plurality of substantially
   planar shaft surfaces 1210 at substantially equal angles with respect to one another.
   One of the vanes is supported with respect to each of the shaft surfaces 1210.

   cuffs 1214a, 1214b are configured to fit within the notches 1228a, 1228b of the vane
   holder 1204. The vane retention section 1224 and defined cavity 1226 are configured
   to securely engage and hold a vane 1118. The vane holder 1204 further includes an
   internal cavity 1232 extending centrally into the body 1222 at a proximal edge 1233 of
 5 the vane holder 1204.
   The vane holders 1204 are configured to be attached to the hub 1202 such that each
   shaft surface 1210 of the shaft 1208 includes a vane holder 1204 mounted thereto.
   This engagement is shown in FIGS. 75 and 76. FIG. 75 is a perspective view showing
10 a plurality of vane holders 1204 mounted to the hub 1202. FIG. 76 is a partial
   sectional view detailing the connection of a single vane holder 1204 to the hub 1202,
   with the first and second cuffs 1214a, 1214b sectioned. In connecting a vane holder
    1204 to a shaft surface 1210, the protrusion 1220 of the shaft surface 1210 engages
   the internal cavity 1232 of the vane holder 1204 while the vane holder first leg 1230a
15 is positioned within the first track 1218a and the vane holder second leg 1230b is
   positioned within the second track 1218b. As shown in FIG. 75, when a vane holder
   1204 is connected to the hub 1202 it is permitted to rotate about the protrusion 1220
   by an angular amount with respect to the center line CL of the hub 1202, for example,
   20 degrees. The vane holder 1204 can rotate both clockwise and counter-clockwise.
20
   FIGS. 72-76 illustrate examples of embodiments where the rotor 1202 further
   includes a cuff 1214a, 1214b at each end of the rotor shaft 1208. Each cuff 1214a,
   1214b has inner surfaces 1216a, 1216b each substantially equidistantly spaced from
   the corresponding one of the shaft surfaces 1210 and forms inner-surface corners
25 which limit the angle of rotation of the vanes.
   FIGS. 72-76 also show that the turbine 1200 further includes a vane holder 1204
   having a rotor-connector forming one of the cavity 1232 and the protrusion 1220 of
   the vane-rotor interconnection and rotatable thereabout between within the inner
30 surfaces 1216a, 1216b of the cuffs 1214a, 1214b. In some versions, the vane holder
   1204 forms an elongate slotted cavity 1226 which is pivotally engaged by the

   elongate proximal edge of the vane.
   FIG. 77 is a partial sectional view of a turbine 1200 according to FIGS. 75 and 76
   including a plurality of turbine vanes 1206, turbine vane holders 1204, and hub 1202
 5 interconnected. FIG. 78 is a sectional view showing the interconnection between the
   vane holders 1204 and the hub 1202, and how the vane holders 1204 can move in
   relation thereto. Particularly, FIG. 77 shows how the first elongate proximal edges
   (fingers) 1230a move within the continuous track 1218a of the turbine hub 1202. As
   shown in FIG. 77, when the vanes 1206 are connected with the vane retention
10 section 1224 of a respective vane holder 1204 the vanes 1206 are capable of rotating
   forward and backward therein. That is, the vanes 1206 can rotate about the axis of
   engagement with the vane holders 1204. Additionally, when the vane holders 1204,
   with the attached vanes 1206, are engaged to the hub 1202 they are capable of
   rotating themselves about the protrusion 1220 (see FIG. 76). Accordingly, the vanes
15  1206 are capable of rotating about two separate axes. Generally, these two axis will
   be perpendicular to one another. FIG. 77 shows the first cuff 1214a in section,
   illustrating the positioning of the first leg 1218a of each vane holder 1204 within the
   first track 1218a. As shown in FIGS. 77 and 78 each first leg 1218a of each vane
   holder 1204 is positioned between a shaft surface 1210 and an internal surface
20  1216a of the cuff 1214a that is parallel to that shaft surface 1210. As shown in FIG.
   78, which is a sectional view focused solely on the interconnection between the first
   fingers 1218a and the first cuff 1214a, due to the matching geometries of the cuff
    1214a and the shaft 1208, each first leg 1218a is restricted from moving beyond the
   surface 1210 that it is mounted to. That is, each first leg 1218a can rotate back and
25 forth across the surface 1210 that it is mounted to, but cannot go around a corner to a
   different surface 1210. The hexagonal inner surface edge stops the vane holder
   1204. Additionally, two vane holders 1204 will make contact before reaching the
   hexagonal inner surface edge. One of ordinary skill in the art should understand that
   this description in connection with the first fingers 1218a also holds true for the
30 second fingers 1218b as well.

   Each of the vane-rotor interconnections may include a cavity 1232 and a protrusion
    1220 within the cavity 1232. In such embodiments, each of the cavity 1232 and the
   protrusion 1220 is formed at a center of one of the shaft surface 1210 and the
   corresponding vane proximal edge 1233 such that the vane proximal edge 1233 is
 5 rotatable thereabout.
    In certain embodiments, the rotor 1202 is configured to limit the angle of rotation of
   the vane. The angle of rotation may be limited to about 20Q with respect to the rotor
   axis CL.

   FIGS. 79-85 illustrate an alternative embodiment for interconnecting a vane 1300 with
   a turbine rotor 1302. FIG. 79 is a partial sectional view showing a vane-rotor
   interconnection 1304 in which a plurality of vanes 1300 are rotatably mounted with a
   turbine rotor 1302. FIG. 80 is a side view of the vane 1300, and FIG. 81 is a front view
15 of the vane 1300. The vane 1300 includes a vane body 1306 having a proximal end
    1308 and a distal end 1310. The vane body 1306 generally curves from the proximal
   end 1308 to the distal and 1310. The vane body 1306 further includes a notch 1312 at
   the center of the proximal end 1308 and extending into the body 1306. A generally
   spherical ball 1314 extends from the body 1306 and is positioned within the notch
20  1312.
   FIGS. 82 and 83 are top views of a vane 1300 interconnected with a rotor 1302 in a
   first and a second rotational position. The rotor 1302 includes a shaft 1316 having a
   plurality of shaft surfaces 1318, and a first and second gear 1320a, 1320b on lateral
25 ends of the shaft 1316. The rotor 1302 further includes a socket 1322 on each shaft
   surface 1318 that defines a cavity 1324. The socket 1322 is configured to receive the
   spherical ball 1314 of the vane 1300 forming the vane-rotor interconnection 1304.
   Accordingly, the vane-rotor interconnection 1304 is a ball-and-socket type connection
   that allows the vane 1300 to freely rotate about a plurality of axes. For example, FIG.
30 79 shows the vanes 1300 rotating forward and backward, while FIGS. 82 and 83
   show the vanes 1300 rotating about an axis that is perpendicular to the shaft surfaces

    1318. FIG. 85 is a partial sectional view showing the vane-rotor interconnection 1304
   in additional detail.
   The rotor 1302 can also include a plurality of static stops 1326 that extend upward
 5 from the shaft surfaces 1318. The static stops 1326 restrict rotational movement of
   the vane 1300 about an axis that is perpendicular to the shaft surfaces 1318. For
   example, the static stops 1326 can be positioned to permit the vane 1300 to rotate up
   to 20 degrees from the centerline CL of the shaft 1316, but prevent the vane 1300
   from rotating greater than 20 degrees.
10
    In certain embodiments such as those illustrated in FIGS. 79-85, the vane-rotor
   interconnection 1304 is a ball-and-socket type connection with the cavity 1324 and
   the protrusion 1314 having complementary substantially spherical shapes such that
   the vane 1300 is rotatable and pivotable between extended and retracted positions
15 with respect to the rotor 1302 to allow passage of substantial-size debris pieces
   through a chamber.
    In some versions, the rotor 1302 includes a set of protrusions 1326 in positions
   limiting the angle of rotation of the vane 1300, as illustrated in FIGS. 82 and 83.

   FIGS. 86 and 87 are perspective views of a vane 1328. The vane 1328 has a vane
   wall 1330 extending between two elongate edges 1332, 1334 which extend in edge
   planes substantially parallel to one another.

   having a vane wall 1346 extending between two elongate edges 1348, 1350. In still
   another aspect of the present disclosure, the vane edges 1340, 1342 of the first vane
30  1336, and the vane edges 1348, 1350 of the second vane 1344 may be angularly

   of the other vane edge is transverse, such vane edge orientation is to facilitate
   passage of substantial-size debris pieces through a chamber. Examples of such
   improved vanes 1336, 1344 are schematically illustrated in FIGS. 88 and 89. The
   vane edges 1340, 1342, 1348, 1350 may be substantially straight and the wall 1338,

   plurality of first right facing vanes 1336 (see FIG. 88) and a plurality of left facing
   vanes 1344 (see FIG. 89). The rotor 1352 can include a plurality of vane holders
10  1354-1354. The vanes 1336, 1344 can be connected to the rotor 1352 in alternating
   fashion such that vane holders 1354a, 1354c, 1354e are connected with right angled
   vanes 1336, while vane holders 1354b, 1354d, 1354f are connected with left angled
   vanes 1344. In certain embodiments where the turbine includes a plurality of vanes
    1336, 1344 connected with respect to the rotor 1352 , the proximal edges 1342, 1350
15 of the vanes 1336, 1344 are substantially parallel to each other. In some of such
   embodiments, the distal edges 1340, 1348 of adjacent vanes 1336, 1344 are
   transverse to each other thereby defining varying size spaces between the adjacent
   vanes 1336, 1344 to further facilitate passage of substantial-size debris pieces
   through a chamber. A diagram of an example of such turbine is shown in FIG. 90.
