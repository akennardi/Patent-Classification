                                                   TITLE
     Stable Povidone-Jodine Compositions with Steroids or Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatories
        The present application is a divisional Australian Patent application from patent application
number <removed-apn>, which in turn is a divisional Australian Patent application from patent
application number 2012253335, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                              BACKGROUND
        Topical corticosteroids are routinely used to control ocular inflammation. Their mechanism
of action involves the inhibition of the immune response and the subsequent tissue destruction that
exuberant inflammation may cause. Corticosteroid has the undesirable side effect of limiting the
body's intrinsic ability to fight infection. In fact, inopportune steroids usage can worsen the course
of an infection secondary to mycobacteria, virus, or fungus. Thus, the use of a combined
antimicrobial-steroid medication in ocular infections is recommended only under careful
observation of a trained ophthalmologist because of these significant risks. In fact, TOBRADEX
(Alcon), the most commonly prescribed combination ophthalmic antimicrobial-steroid drug,
specifically lists 'viral disease of the comea and conjunctiva, mycobacteria infection, and fungal
infection' as absolute contraindications to its use. Clearly, these combination drugs were not
intended to be used in the face of infectious conjunctivitis in which bacterial infection cannot be
confirmed.
        In U.S. Patent 7,767,217, it is shown that under certain specific conditions, dexamethasone
can be combined with povidone-iodine (PVP-I) to form an effective antimicrobial-steroid
pharmaceutical composition. However, it is also shown that most preparations which combine
PVP-I (or iodine) with a steroid suffer from instability due, in part, to reactivity of the iodine with
the steroid. In fact, U.S. Patent 3,886,268 demonstrates the well-known instability of steroid-iodine
combinations.

                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
         It is known that iodine, including preparations of PVP-I, reacts chemically with various
steroids when combined with a steroid, resulting in an unstable composition, due in part to
reactivity of the iodine with the steroid. U.S. Patent 3,886,268 demonstrates the well-known
instability of steroid-iodine combinations. It is also known that certain non-steroidal anti
inflammatory compounds ("NSAIDS") also react with iodine. However, U.S. Patent 7,767,217,
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, illustrates that under certain specific conditions,
dexamethasone, for example, can be combined with PVP-I to form an effective antimicrobial
steroid pharmaceutical composition. U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/485,475, to
which the present application claims priority, is also incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety.
Compositions
         In an embodiment, compositions disclosed herein comprise PVP-I and a steroid, In an
embodiment, compositions disclosed herein comprise PVP-I and an NSAID.              In another
embodiment, a composition disclosed herein is a pharmaceutical composition. In another
embodiment, a composition disclosed herein is an ophthalmic composition.
         The invention provides, in part, compositions comprising PVP-I in the range of about
0.01% to about 10% (weight/weight or weight/volume) and a steroid at a concentration of about
0.001% to about 10%. The invention also provides, in part, ophthalmic compositions comprising
povidone-iodine in the range of about 0.01% to about 10% (weight/weight or weight/volume)
and a therapeutically effective amount of a steroid at a concentration of about 0.001% to about
                                                   11

  WO 2012/155062                                                               PCT/US2012/037563
10%. The invention provides, in part, compositions comprising PVP-I in the range of about
0.01% to about 10% (weight/weight or weight/volume) and an NSAID at a concentration of
about 0.001% to about 10%. The invention also provides, in part, ophthalmic compositions
comprising povidone-iodine in the range of about 0.01% to about 10% (weight/weight or
weight/volume) and a therapeutically effective amount of an NSAID at a concentration of about
0.001% to about 10%.
        The affinity of free iodine for reaction with -- OH, -- SH and --NH functional groups is
well described in the literature and forms the basis for the anti-microbial activity of iodine
containing solutions (Rackur H. J. Hosp. Infect., 1985; 6: 13-23, and references therein).
Dexamethasone, (9-Fluoro- 11 beta., 17, 21 -trihydroxy- 16.alpha.-methylpregna- 1, 4-diene-3, 20
dione) for example, contains three such moieties (--OH) at the 11, 17 and 21 positions. The
skilled artisan would conclude that these hydroxyl groups would be prone to covalent
substitution reactions by the free iodine generated in the solution equilibrium reaction described
above for PVP-I.
        In preparing the present compositions, experiments of combinations of various steroids
and PVP-I, as well as combinations of various NSAIDS and PVP-I, were performed. It was
observed that many formulations were unsuccessful because of the rapid reaction between PVP-I
and the added steroid. It was surprising to discover that separate solutions of PVP-I and
prednisolone acetate, PVP-I and loteprednol etabonate, PVP-I and hydrocortisone acetate, and
PVP-I and difluprednate demonstrate unexpected stability, based on what was previously known
in the art. It was also surprising to discover that solutions of PVP-I and bromfenac demonstrate
unexpected stability, based on what was previously known in the art. In an embodiment, a
combination of PVP-I and one of the steroids or NSAIDS identified above each remains stable
for a month or longer.
        In an embodiment, a composition comprises PVP-I and prednisolone acetate. In another
embodiment, a composition is a pharmaceutical composition comprising PVP-I and prednisolone
acetate. In another embodiment, a composition is an ophthalmic preparation comprising PVP-I
and prednisolone acetate.

Example 1: Stability Testing For Steroids Combined With Povidone Iodine
        The objective of this study was to determine whether povidone iodine (PVP-I) at the
concentration of 4 mg/mL (0.4%) reacts with any of four different steroids (dexamethasone
sodium phosphate, prednisolone acetate, loteprednol etabonate, and difluprednate), the active
ingredients, in pharmaceutical formulations under both room temperature and 40 'C for a time
period of one month.

         Dexamethasone sodium phosphate ophthalmic solution (USP, 0.1%) from Alcon
Laboratories, prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension (USP, 1%) from Alcon Laboratories,
loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension (0.5%) from Baush & Lomb, and difluprednate
ophthalmic emulsion (0.05%) from Sirion Therapeutics were used for this study. PVP-I was
prepared in water at the concentration of 100 mg/mL (10%). One milliliter of the solution,
suspension, or emulsion was mixed with 40 [pL of 10% PVP-I in 1.5 mL amber glass vials,
followed by storage under both room temperature and 40 "C for 2 weeks and one month. The
resultant samples in the presence of PVP-I were analyzed using HPLC. The four steroid levels
were measured against the reference standard samples stored under room temperature in the
absence of PVP-I (0.4%). The One Month stability test samples were analyzed with the
reference standard sample using LC-MS/MS Method in MRM mode with three characteristic ion
transitions to confirm the identity of four steroids in stability testing samples. The presence of
each of the four steroids in the respective pharmaceutical formulations tested was confirmed by
LC/UV-MS and MS/MS. Thus, the four pharmaceutical formulations can be used in the study.
         After storage under room temperature and 40 C at the presence of PVP-I (0.4%), the
levels of dexamethasone phosphate in two week samples were only 83.04% and 84.57% of those
in room temperature and 40 C Day 0 samples, respectively. The respective data are 84.24% and
84.09% for one month testing, indicating that dexamethasone phosphate was not stable in the
presence of PVP-I (0.4%) under the current testing conditions. Three degradation products (D1,
D2, and D3) were observed.
         After storage under room temperature and 40 C in the presence of PVP-I (0.4%), the
levels of prednisolone acetate in two week testing samples were 99.24% and 96.60% of those in
room temperature and 40 C Day 0 samples, respectively. The respective data are 95.66% and
 96.79% for one month testing. Identical mass ion chromatograms and same intensities of mass
 ion response were observed in the reference standard and one month stability testing samples.
 The results from both HPLC/UV and LC-MS/MS analysis indicate that prednisolone acetate was
 stable in the presence of PVP-I (0.4%) under the current testing conditions.
         After storage under room temperature and 40 C in the presence of PVP-I (0.4%), the
 levels of loteprednol etabonate in two week testing samples were 101.43% and 100.07% of those
 in room temperature and 40 C Day 0 samples, respectively. The respective data are 100.72%

and 96.02% for one month testing. Identical mass ion chromatograms and same intensities of
mass ion response were observed in the reference standard and one month stability testing
samples. The results from both HPLC/UV and LC-MS/MS analysis indicate that loteprednol
etabonate was stable in the presence of PVP-I (0.4%) under the current testing conditions.
        After storage under room temperature and 40 C in the presence of PVP-I (0.4%), the
levels of difluprednate in two week testing samples were 103.23% and 99.30% of those in room
temperature and 40 C Day 0 samples, respectively. The respective data are 104.47% and
100.24% for one month testing. Identical mass ion chromatograms and same intensities of mass
ion response were observed in the reference standard and one month stability testing samples.
The results from both HPLC/UV and LC-MS/MS analysis indicate that difluprednate was stable
in the presence of PVP-I (0.4%) under the current testing conditions.

3.1     LC/MS and MS/MS Analyses of Four Formulations
        The four formulations used in this study were analyzed by HPLC -UV and MS and
MS/MS. The HPLC-UV chromatograms and ESI-MS and MS/MS spectral data were presented
in Figure 1 to Figure 4.
        The presence of four steroids in the pharmaceutical formulations was confirmed by
LC/UV-MS and MS/MS. Thus, the four pharmaceutical formulations can be used for this study.
3.2     HPLC System Suitability Testing
        The four standard samples at the concentration of 50 g/mL were analyzed using
HPLC/UV methods developed at PharmaOn. The data are summarized in Table III.
        As shown in Table III, the system used in this study was suitable to detennine the levels
of four steroids in the stability test samples.

3.3      HPLC/UV and LC-MS/MS Analysis of Stability Testing Samples
3.3.1    Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate
3.3.1.1 PVP-I Sample
         PVP-I in solvent at the same concentration as in stability test samples of dexamethasone
sodium phosphate was analyzed using HPLC Method 1. The HPLC/UV chromatograms are
depicted in Figure 5.
         No dexamethasone phosphate was observed in PVP-I sample.
3.3.1.2 Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate Stability Samples
         The Day 0, Two Week, and One Month stability test samples were analyzed with
reference standard samples (stored at room temperature in the absence of PVP I) using HPLC
Method 1. The sample in the absence of PVP-I with the same concentration of dexamethasone
phosphate as those stability samples at the presence of PVP-I was stored in the same stability
chamber at 40'C for one month as control sample. The control sample was analyzed under the
same conditions. The concentrations of dexamethasone phosphate in the stability samples were
calculated. The data were summarized in Table IV. The HPLC/UV chromatograms of all
reference standards and stability testing samples are depicted in Figure 6 to Figure 13.
         The One Month stability test samples were analyzed with the reference standard sample
using LC-MS/MS Method in MRM mode with three characteristic ion transitions to confirm the
identity of dexamethasone phosphate in stability testing samples. The mass ion chromatograms
 are presented in Figure 14 to Figure 16.
          Identity of dexamethasone phosphate in reference standard sample and two One month
 stability test samples was confirmed by LC-MS/MS.
          After storage at room temperature and 40'C in the presence of PVP-I (0.4%), the levels
 of dexamethasone phosphate in two weeks samples were only 83.04% and 84.57% of those in
 room temperature and 40'C Day 0 samples, respectively (Table IV). The respective data are
 84.24% and 84.09% for one month testing (Table IV), indicating that dexamethasone phosphate

3.3.2   Prednisolone Acetate
3.3.2.1 PVP-I Sample
        PVP-I in solvent at the same concentration as in stability test samples of prednisolone
acetate was analyzed using HPLC Method 2. The HPLC/UV chromatograms are depicted in
Figure 17.
        No prednisolone acetate was observed in PVP-I sample.
3.3.2.2 Prednisolone Acetate Stability Samples
         The Day 0, Two Week, and One Month stability test samples were analyzed with
reference standard samples (stored at room temperature in the absence of PVP I) using HPLC
Method 2. The sample in the absence of PVP-I with the same concentration of prednisolone
acetate as those stability samples at the presence of PVP-I was stored in the same stability
chamber at 40 oC for two week and one month as control samples. The control samples were
analyzed under the same conditions. The concentrations of prednisolone acetate in the stability
samples were calculated. The data were summarized in Table V. The HPLC/UV
chromatograms of all reference standards and stability testing samples are depicted in Figure 18
to Figure 23.
         The One Month stability test samples were analyzed with the reference standard sample
using LC-MS/MS Method in MRM mode with three characteristic ion transitions to confirm the
identity of prednisolone acetate in stability testing samples. The mass ion chromatograms are
presented in Figure 24 to Figure 26.
         After storage at room temperature and 40'C in the presence of PVP-I (0.4%), the levels
of prednisolone acetate in two week testing samples were 99.24% and 96.60% of those in room
temperature and 40'C Day 0 samples, respectively (Table V). The respective data are 95.66%
 and 96.79% for one month testing (Table V). Identical mass ion chromatograms and same
intensities of mass ion response were observed in the reference standard and one month stability
testing samples. The results from both HPLC/UV and LC-MS/MS analysis indicate that
 prednisolone acetate was stable in the presence of PVP-I (0.4%) under the current testing
 conditions.

          The One Month stability test samples were analyzed with the reference standard sample
using LC-MS/MS Method in MRM mode with three characteristic ion transitions to confirm the
identity of loteprednol etabonate in stability testing samples. The mass ion chromatograms are
presented in Figure 34 to Figure 36.
          After storage at room temperature and 40'C in the presence of PVP-I (0.4%), the levels
 of loteprednol etabonate in two week testing samples were 101.43% and 100.07% of those in
 room temperature and 40'C Day 0 samples, respectively (Table VI). The respective data are
 100.72% and 96.02% for one month testing (Table VI). Identical mass ion chromatograms and
 same intensities of mass ion response were observed in the reference standard and one month

Example 2: Stability Testing For Steroids and NSAIDS Combined With 0.6% Povidone
Iodine
          Steroids and NSAIDS were mixed with PVP-I at the concentration of 0.6% w/w on
Day 1. The resultant mixtures will be split to glass vials and stored at room temperature.
fluorometholone alcohol, medrysone, prednisone sodium phosphate, rimexolone,
hydrocortisone, hydrocortisone acetate, lodoxamide tromethamine, nepafenac, bromfenac,
and ketorolac. Testing timepoints included day 0 (Time Zero), and week 4. Tests were
conducted at room temperature. The testing samples were analyzed using liquid
chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) methods at Day 0, and Week 4.
The steroids and NSAIDS standards were also analyzed and steroids and NSAIDS levels in
testing samples were determined.
          Rimexolone, hydrocortisone acetate, lodoxamide, and bromfenac samples appeared to
be stable. Nepafenac was generally stable, but to a lesser degree. Prednisone sodium
phosphate was stable to a lesser degree than nepafenac. In an embodiment, a result wherein
about 10% or greater reduction in concentration of a compound of interest is observed is an
indication that the compound is not stable. In an embodiment, a result wherein a reduction in
the concentration of a compound of interest is observed, but about less than 10% reduction in
concentration of a compound of interest is observed, is an indication that the compound is
semi-stable. In an embodiment, a result wherein there is substantially no reduction in
concentration of a compound of interest observed is an indication that the compound is stable.
          Table VIII illustrates the analytical data summary of bromfenac stability testing in
0.6% PVP-I at room temperature. Table IX illustrates the analytical data summary of
hydrocortisone acetate stability testing in 0.6% PVP-I at room temperature. Table X
illustrates the analytical data summary of rimexolone stability testing in 0.6% PVP-I at room
temperature. Table XI illustrates the analytical data summary of prednisone sodium
phosphate stability testing in 0.6% PVP-I at room temperature. Table XII illustrates the
analytical data summary of nepafenac stability testing in 0.6% PVP-I at room temperature.
Table XIII illustrates the analytical data summary of fluorometholone stability testing in 0.6%
PVP-I at room temperature. For Tables VIII-XIII, a: Nominal concentration in HPLC samples;
b: Calculated concentration in HPLC samples; c: Dilution factor; d: Calculated concentration in
 stability samples; e: Spiked 50pL of H20 and stored at room temperature without PVP-I.
