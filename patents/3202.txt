   Field of the Invention
 5 The invention generally relates to remote control of
   signalling devices. Typically, such signalling devices are
   configured for producing a signal    (e.g. light) upon
   reception of a wireless instruction to do so.
10 Background to the Invention
   Participation in sports  (socially, competitively, and
   professionally) typically involves undertaking practice in
   particular drills designed to improve the ability of the
15 participant to perform well.    Such drills can involve
   additional equipment not typically utilised within the
   actual sport itself.
   In ball sports, some typical drills will aim to improve
20 control and aim of the ball in question    (improvement in
   "ball skills").  For example, in soccer, a participant
   might be expected to receive the ball from another
   participant, and then to achieve a certain level of
   control of the ball before passing the ball to another
25 participant or taking a shot at goal.
   Existing drills for improving ball skills may rely upon a
   coach passing a ball to a participant, and then the
   participant is expected to demonstrate control before
30 passing the ball to another player.
   It would be desirable to provide means to enable a coach
   to signal to the participant an intended destination for
   the ball at any time, thereby enabling the coach to
35 "surprise" the participant with a destination not known to
   the participant until they have demonstrated control over
   the received ball.
                                                     10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

                              - 2
   It is further desirable that the signal is easily
   perceived by the participant.

20 electrical connection between the battery unit and the
   signalling module may be provided, which enable electrical
   connection only when the housing and signalling module are
   in a predefined relative position.
25 Typically, the signalling module comprises a transparent
   or translucent protective wall configured to allow

   Preferably, the proximity sensor is configured to detect
   an impact between the object and the signalling device
10  (wherein the impact corresponds to the predefined
   distance).  The controller unit is optionally configured to
   disable the light source after a predetermined elapsed
   time from enabling the light source.
15 Preferably, the communication comprises an identifier, and
   the controller unit determines that the instruction is
   intended for the signalling device at least due to the
   identifier being associated with it.

   ZigBee; and Z-Wave.
   The signalling device may be permanently configured as one
   of a master and a slave. Alternatively, the signalling
30 device may be selectively configurable as a master or a
   slave. Optionally, when configured as a master, the
   signalling device is further configured to: determine that
   data received by the wireless communication module
   comprises an instruction intended for another signalling
35 device configured as a slave; and communicate said data to
   the other signalling device. Optionally, when selectively
   configured as a slave, the signalling device is configured
                                                   10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

   Typically, the end condition comprises at least one of: a
   predetermined elapsed time since enablement of the light
10 source; a signal or signals produced by one or more
   sensors; and a communication from the activation device
   instructing that the signalling device should disable the

   by the activation device; and in response, determine that
   the data comprises an instruction for it to change to an
   enabled mode and to then activate its light source or
   determine that the data does not comprise an instruction
35 for it to change to an enabled mode and to then discard
   the data.
                                                  10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

   Detail description of particular embodiments
20 In the drawings, general elements are labelled with a
   numerical reference. A general element can comprise
   multiple specific instances   (such as the different
   signalling devices 12a-c of Figure 1),    which are labelled
   with the numerical reference of the general element and an
25 additional letter suffix to distinguish the specific
   instances. Also in the drawings, method steps shown in
   broken lines correspond to optional steps.
   Referring to Figures la and 1b, there is shown a remote
30 signalling system 10 according two embodiments.        In each
   case, the remote signalling system 10 comprises two or
   more signalling devices 12   (three signalling devices 12a,
   12b, 12c are shown in the figure) and an activation device
   14. In Figure 1, the activation device 14 is in wireless
35 one-way communication with the signalling devices 12a-c.
   In Figure 2, the activation device 14 is in wireless two
   way communication with the signalling devices 12a-c. Also
                                                    10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

   shown, though optional, is the activation device 14          in
   data communication with a network 16. Also optionally, the
   activation device 14 is in data communication with network
   storage 18 via the network 16.

   According to the embodiment of Figure 1, the activation
   device 14 is in one-way communication with the signalling
   devices 12a-c, such that the activation device 14 is
   configured for communicating data to the signalling
10 devices 12a-c. Typically, according to this embodiment,
   the activation device 14 is configured for intermittent
   communication; that is, the activation device 14 is not in
   continuous data communication with the signalling devices
   12a-c. For example, the activation device 14 communicates
15 data to one or more of the signalling devices 12a-c in
   response to an input received from a user of the
   activation device 14. According to the embodiment of
   Figure 2, the activation device 14 is in two-way
   communication with the signalling devices 12a-c. Herein,
20 it is assumed that either embodiment is applicable to
   features described unless specified otherwise.
   Referring to Figure 3, each signalling device 12 comprises
   a housing 20 and a signalling module 22. The signalling
25 module 22 is attachable to the housing 20 via
   complementary attachment features 23, 27 located on the
   housing 20 and signalling module 22 respectively.
   Typically, the complementary attachment features 23,           27
   comprise threaded portions configured to allow attachment
30 via screwing of the housing 20 relative to the signalling
   module. It is understood that any suitable attachment
   feature or features 23, 27 may be utilised.   That is,
   attachment features 23 or 27 located on one of the housing
   20 and signalling module 22 are envisaged. Generally,
35 alternative attachment features 23, 27 include friction
   based features, one or more clips, one or more screws,
   etc. Sealing means 25, such as an O-ring, can be provided
                                                  10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

                               - 11
   to seal the internal portions of the housing 20 and
   signalling module 22 from environmental factors, such as
   liquid or moisture. In a modification    (not shown),         the
   signalling module 22 is formed integrally with the housing
 5 20.  In another modification  (not shown),  the signalling
   module 22 is formed separately and subsequently attached
   to the housing 20 such as to be permanently attached to
   the housing 20.
10 The signalling device 12 is typically for use in outdoor
   environments, and may be subject to wear and tear common
   to sports equipment. Due to this, the housing 20 comprises
   a sufficiently durable material in order to resist damage
   in these environments. Also, the housing 20 is typically
15 required to be waterproof. The housing can be, for
   example, formed from one or more of: polyethylene,
   polypropylene, nylon, polyamides, engineered plastics,
   etc.
20 The particular signalling device shape shown in Figure 3
   is suitable for use with drills associated with certain
   sports, such as soccer. The shape is similar to training
   cones, with a base diameter at least approximately 90 mm
   and a height of at least approximately 60 mm. More
25 generally, the shape and dimensions can take on a variety
   of forms as required, for example, alternative shapes
   include posts, disks, boxes, etc.
   According to an embodiment, housing 20 contains a battery
30 unit 26. The battery unit 26 includes a rechargeable
   battery  (which may comprise one or more cells) and the
   housing 20 comprises a connection point 28 for allowing an
   external charger to be connected to the battery unit 26 to
   enable charging of the battery. The connection point 28
35 can be of conventional design, including but not limited
   to one of: a socket for receiving a jack;    and exposed
   conductive pins configured to interface with charging pins
                                                     10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

                               - 12
   of another device.   The battery unit 26 is optionally
   removable.  Alternatively, the housing 26 does not
   comprise a connection point 28 and the battery unit 26
   must be removed once the battery is no longer sufficiently
 5 charged and replaced with a charged battery unit 26. In a
   related alternative, the battery is not rechargeable. The
   housing 20 also comprises an on/off switch 29. It is
   envisaged that a signalling device 12 could be configured
   for charging the battery of another signalling device 12.
10
   The housing 20 comprises means to allow electrical
   connection between the two terminals of the battery of the
   battery unit 26 and the signalling module 22.   In
   implementations having an attachable signalling module 22,
15 contact points are provided to enable the electrical
   connection. In the example shown in Figure 3, the contact
   points constitute two pins which are configured for
   interfacing with corresponding contact points on the
   signalling module 22.  In this example, the contact points
20 are only engaged for allowing electrical conductivity when
   the signalling module 22 and housing 20 are in a
   predefined relative position, such as completely threaded
   together where the attachment features 23a, 23b are
   complementary threaded portions. Alternative means for
25 enabling electrical connection are envisaged, such as
   electrical wires provided with both the housing 20 and
   signalling module 22,  the electrical wires including
   complementary connectors   (such as a plug and a socket),
   which can be connected together before the housing 20 and
30 signalling module 22 are attached.
   In implementations where housing 20 and signalling module
   22 are formed integrally, it is typical that a fixed
   connection is provided between the signalling module 22
35 and battery unit 26.
   The housing 20 can comprise additional compartments and
                                                   10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

                              - 13
   features. For example, the housing 20 can be provided with
   wheels or similar to assist with moving the signalling
   device 12. Also, a compartment or several compartments can
   be provided for storing additional features of the
 5 signalling device 12, such as replacement parts.
   The signalling module 22 comprises a transparent or
   translucent protective wall 34 and a light source.
   According to embodiments described herein the light source
10 comprises a light emitting diode module comprising one or
   a plurality of light emitting diodes  (LED) 38. Typically,
   the protective wall 34 is transparent or translucent to
   the entire visible spectrum, however it is understood that
   the protective wall 34 may be coloured such that it is
15 transparent to a subset of the visible wavelengths, such
   as a subset encompassing the wavelengths of the one or
   more LEDs 38. Though reference is made herein to LEDs 38,
   any suitable electrically powered light source can be
   utilised in conjunction with or instead of LEDs 38.
20 Furthermore, reference is made typically to a plurality if
   LEDs 38, however it is understood that there may be a
   single LED 38 for each signalling device 12.
   Similar to the housing, the protective wall 34 is
25 sufficiently durable to withstand normal wear and tear
   associated with sports practice. In particular, the
   protective wall 34 is typically required to be waterproof.
   The protective wall 34, optionally in conjunction with the
   housing 20, encases the light source. In an embodiment,
30 the protective wall 34 comprises a rigid, durable plastic,
   such as such as polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon,
   polyamides, engineered plastics, etc.
   In an embodiment, the signalling device 12 further
35 comprises an elastically deformable outer wall 39, whereby
   it can deform upon receiving an impact  (such as when hit
   by a player) and subsequently revert to its usual shape.

   In this embodiment, the outer wall 39 can comprise a
   thermoplastic elastomer. In an implementation of this
   embodiment, outer wall 39 is affixed to the signalling
   module 22 via a retaining ring configured for threaded
 5 engagement with the housing 20. The retaining ring in this
   case is configured to secure an outside region of the
   protective wall 34 between itself and the housing 20.
   Other means for affixing the outer wall 39 to the housing
   20 and/or signalling module 22 may instead be employed.
10
   The signalling module 22 is shown schematically in Figure
   4.  The signalling module 22 comprises a controller unit
   40 interfaced to a wireless communication module 42.           The
   controller unit 40 comprises a processor 41 configured to
15 selectively enable and disable the LEDs 38 in response to
   communication between the wireless communication module 42
   and the activation device 14. The processor 41 can be, for
   example, a microcontroller. The LEDs 38 can be interfaced
   to an LED controller 43, which is itself interfaced to the
20 processor 41 of the controller unit 40. The processor 41
   thereby provides instruction to the LED controller 43 to
   enable or disable one, some, or all of the LEDs 38,         as
   required. In an embodiment, features of the signalling
   module 22 are coated in an appropriate  (e.g. insulating
25 and transparent) resin to provide additional protection
   from shock and the elements.
   In an embodiment, one or more features of the signalling
   module 22 are physically separable from other features of
30 the module 22. For example, the controller unit 40 and
   wireless communication module 42 can be located within the
   housing 20 and the LEDs 38 are located in a separable
   structural component comprising the protective wall 34.
   When attached, the LEDs 38 and controller unit 40 are in
35 electrical communication, thereby providing the
   functionality of the signalling module 22.
                                                  10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

                               - 15
   In embodiments providing for one-way communication between
   the activation device 14 and the signalling device 12, the
   wireless communication module 42 is configured for
   receiving data only. In embodiments providing for two-way
 5 communication between the activation device 14 and the
   signalling device 12, the wireless communication module 42
   is configured for receiving and transmitting data.
   Each LED 38 can be a single colour LED or a multiple
10 colour LED  (an LED with selectable colour output).         In
   embodiments  comprising a plurality of LEDs 38, the LEDs
   can be of the same type or differ in colour output.
   The controller unit 40 is configured to identify an
15 instruction to enable one or more LEDs 38.   In response,
   the controller unit 40 performs actions to enable the
   relevant LEDs 38.  "Enabled mode" of the signalling device
   12 corresponds to one or more LEDs 38 being enabled.
   Similarly, "disabled mode" of the signalling device 12
20 corresponds to no LEDs 38 being enabled   (all LEDs 38 are
   disabled).  In embodiments comprising one or more multiple
   colour LEDs, the instruction may also comprise information
   specifying a colour for at least one multicolour LED.
25 The signalling device 12 is maintained in the enabled mode
   until the controller unit 40 performs actions to disable
   all of the LEDs 38,  thereby causing the signalling device
   12 to enter the disabled mode.   In an embodiment, enabled
   mode is maintained for a predetermined amount of time,
30 before returning to disabled mode. Alternatively, or in
   combination, the controller unit 40 can be configured to
   maintain enabled mode until receiving a further
   instruction to disable the LEDs 38.  The further
   instruction can be received from the wireless
35 communication module 42.
   In an embodiment, the number of LEDs 38 enabled upon
                                                   10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

                                - 16
   receiving the instruction is dependent on an ambient light
   reading and/or a time of day. The ambient light reading
   and/or time of day may be specified by the wireless
   communication module 42.   For example, all LEDs 38 are
 5 enabled during the day, half the LEDs 38 are enabled at
   dawn and dusk, and a quarter of the LEDs 38 are enabled at
   night.
   In an embodiment, the controller unit 40 is further
10 interfaced to one or more sensors 44. The controller unit
   40 is configured to,   in response to receiving a signal
   from at least one sensor 44,    disable the LEDs 38.       In an
   implementation, at least one sensor 44 is a proximity
   sensor, configured to sense an object     (e.g. a ball such as
15 a soccer ball or a player) coming within a certain
   distance of the signalling device 12. The proximity sensor
   can be a motion detector capable of sensing contacting
   between an object   (such as a ball or a player) and the
   signalling device 12. On detecting the object, the
20 proximity sensor signals the controller unit 40, which
   then causes the signalling device 12 to enter its disabled
   mode. In an embodiment, the proximity sensor is configured
   to detect contact between the object and the signalling
   device 12.
25
   The controller unit 40 can also be interfaced with an
   indicator light 32.   The indicator light 32 can represent a
   single state, or several difference states, of the
   signalling device 12. For example, the indicator light 32
30 can be used to show a low battery situation.
   The activation device 14 is configured for wireless
   communication with the one or more signalling devices 12.
   As previously described, the wireless communication can be
35 one-way  (see Figure 1) or two-way    (see Figure 2).
   In either case, the activation device 14 is configured for
                                                     10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

                               - 17
   communicating data comprising an instruction for one or
   more  (typically, a single instruction is directed towards
   one) of the signalling devices 12 to switch to its enabled
   mode. Optionally, the data comprises further information
 5 relating to the operation of the signalling device 12.
   Examples of further information are described with respect
   to specific embodiments.
   Seeing as the communication is wireless, typically the
10 data sent by the activation device 14 is not directly
   targeted to the intended signalling device 12, and instead
   the data is broadcast to several  (often all) of the
   signalling devices 12.  Therefore, the data includes an
   identifier, the identifier being uniquely associated with
15 the intended signalling device 12. When a signalling
   device 12 receives data from the activation device 14,                it
   is configured to determine, based on the received
   identifier, whether it is the intended signalling device
   12 or not. If the signalling device 12 determines that it
20 is the intended signalling device 12,  it continues to
   process the received information. Otherwise, the
   signalling device 12 discards the received information.
   The identifiers can be dynamically determined, which is
25 particular suitable for embodiments having two-way
   communication. Here, an initial communication occurs
   between each of the signalling devices 12 and the
   activation device 14 in order to determine a unique
   identifier for each signalling device 12. Alternatively,
30 the identifiers are preconfigured for each signalling
   device 12.
   An identifier can be a network address of the wireless
   communication module 42,  in which case the data is only
35 provided to the processor 41 if the network communication
   module 42 determines that the received network address is
   its network address.
                                                   10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

                               - 18
   In an alternative embodiment, each signalling device 12 is
   configured to respond to a unique wireless band. In this
   case, rather than transmitting identifiers, the activation
 5 device 14 simply broadcasts within the band associated
   with the particular signalling device 12.
   The activation device 14 comprises hardware that can be
   conventional in nature or specifically designed for the
10 purpose. Reference is primarily made to the activation
   device 14 implemented as a function of a portable
   computing device such as a smartphone, however, a
   specially designed portable device having inbuilt
   instructions and hardware for producing the functionality
15 of the activation device 14 is also envisaged.
   The activation device 14 comprises a wireless unit having
   the same wireless protocol as the wireless communication
   module 42.  Suitable wireless communication protocols
20 include: proprietary RF communications; Bluetooth; Wi-Fi
    (802.11a,b,g,n etc.); ZigBee;  Z-Wave; etc.
   The activation device 14 also comprises a user interface
   configured for receiving an input from a user of the
25 activation device 14. The user interface enables a user
   to:  select one of the plurality of signalling devices 12
   to which to send information; and to trigger the
   activation device 14 to communicate the information. In an
   embodiment, the user interface comprises an electronic
30 display, such as a touchscreen. In another embodiment, the
   user interface comprises buttons, switches, and the like.
   Referring to Figure 5, a method for operating the
   activation device 14 in order to cause communication with
35 a signalling device 12 according to an embodiment is
   shown. This method is applicable to embodiments having
   one-way or two-way communications. The user interface is
                                                  10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

                               - 19
   an electronic display interface 48,   which presents to the
   user a display suitable for enabling the user to select
   one of a plurality of signalling devices 12,   at interface
   step 101. Generally, the display is generated by the
 5 activation device 14 as required. In another embodiment,
   the user interface comprises buttons, each associated
   uniquely with a signalling device 12.   In this embodiment,
   interface step 101 simply corresponds to the user viewing
   the selection of buttons available.
10
   The plurality of signalling devices 12 can be known to the
   activation device 14;  for example, the plurality is pre
   selected and always presented to the user. In an
   alternative, the user configures the activation device 14
15 before use of the device 14,   for example, by inputting
   into the activation device 14 identification information
   uniquely associated with each signalling device 12.            In yet
   another alternative, applicable to embodiments having two
   way communication, each signalling device 12 communicates
20 information to the activation device 12 indicating that it
   is present and activated;  from this information the
   activation device 14 generates the interface to present to
   the user at optional generation step 100.
25 In an embodiment, each signalling device 12 comprises a
   locating module interfaced with its controller unit 40.
   The locating module is configured for determining a
   spatial location of the signalling device 12,   and can
   comprise a GPS unit. Each signalling device 12
30 communicates to the activation device 12 its spatial
   location. From this information, the activation device 12
   generates an interface representing the relative locations
   of the signalling devices 12.
35 The user, via the display interface 48, selects one of the
   signalling devices 12,  as selection step 102.  The display
   interface 48 can correspond to a touch screen of a
                                                    10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

   smartphone, in which case the user touches the display
   interface 48 in a particular region of the screen to
   select the particular signalling device 12.   In an
   alternative, the user interacts with a hardware button of
 5 the display interface 48.  In another alternative, the user
   presses a button of the user interface.
   Figure 6 shows an example display interface 48 of the
   activation device 14. Here, a touch screen of a smartphone
10 displays icons 52 for each of the plurality    (in this case,
   there are three) of signalling devices 12. The user
   selects a particular signalling device 12 by touching the
   associated icon 52. Also shown is a group icon 53.           The
   group icon 53 can be preconfigured to correspond to two or
15 more signalling devices 12.   Touching the group icon 53
   will cause the activation device 14 to communicate to each
   of the preselected signalling devices 12 without further
   input.
20 Referring back to Figure 5, the activation device 14
   transmits wirelessly data comprising the identifier of the
   selected signalling device 12 and an instruction to enable
   the signalling device 12, at transmission step 103.
25 The selected signalling device 12 and typically at least
   one other signalling device 12   (usually, all of the
   signalling devices 12 within range) then receive the data
   at reception step 104. Each signalling device 12 then
   performs check step 105 in order to determine whether the
30 instruction is directed towards it.   If a signalling device
   12 determines the instruction is for a different
   signalling device 12, then the method advances to data
   discard step 106 and the signalling device 12 takes no
   further action  (with respect to this method).
35
   When a signalling device 12 determines that the
   instruction is for it, the method proceeds to signal
                                                    10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

                              - 21
   enable step 107. In this step, the signalling device 12
   enters enabled mode; that is, it enables its LEDs 38 and
   any other optional feature associated with the enabled
   state. The signalling device 12 then checks  (periodically
 5 or continuously) for an end condition to be satisfied, at
   step 108.
   Once the end condition is satisfied, the signalling device
   12 then proceeds to signal disable step 109, which simply
10 corresponds to entering the disabled mode; that is,          it
   disables the LEDs 38 and any other optional features.
   Regarding optional features, these may be enabled and
   disabled at different points in time to the LEDs 38,
15 depending on the implementation. Optional features are
   associated with the signalling module 22 separate to the
   light source, which typically provide non-optical
   signalling. One example is an acoustic module for
   producing sounds. When entering enabled mode, a sound is
20 produced by this module, either as a one-off sound or
   continuously until the signalling device 12 enters
   disabled mode.
   End conditions can be selected from one or more of
25 (amongst other possible end conditions):  a specified
   period of time occurring since entering enabled mode;
   detection by a sensor of an end condition  (such as a
   proximity sensor detecting the presence of an object); and
   the activation device 14 communicating data to the
30 signalling device 12 indicating that it should enter
   disabled mode.
   Referring to Figures 7a and 7b, embodiments utilising two
   way communication are shown  (as shown schematically in
35 Figure 2).  It is understood that the two embodiments
   described can be combined.
                                                  10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

                              - 22
   Referring first to Figure 7a, a method is shown wherein
   the signalling devices 12 are configured to send responses
   to received instructions. The method can be implemented as
   a modification to the method of Figure 5, and steps 100
 5 104 are not shown in Figure 7a. Upon receiving data from
   the activation device 14, a signalling device 12
   determines if the instruction associated with the data is
   intended for it at check step 105, as previously
   described.
10
   According to the present method, the signalling device 12
   sends an acknowledgement in dependence on the result of
   check step 105. In the present embodiment, a signalling
   device 12 communicates to the activation device 14 an
15 accept acknowledgement at step 110 if it determines that
   the instruction is for it. On the other hand, a signalling
   device 12 communicates to the activation device 14 a
   decline acknowledgement at step 112 if it determines the
   instruction is not for it.  It is envisaged that at least
20 one of these steps 110, 112 may be an optional step.
   The method also includes a step of an enabled signalling
   device 12 sending an end acknowledgement   (step 111)         in
   response to the end condition being satisfied, thereby
25 informing the activation device 14 that the signalling
   device 12 has changed status to disabled mode.
   The present embodiment allows for the activation device 14
   to be informed accurately of the status of each signalling
30 device 12, which may be of benefit where the user cannot
   see the LEDs 38 of the signalling devices 12, but requires
   that the activation device 14 accurately presents current
   statuses.
35 Referring now to Figure 7b, an embodiment is described
   having the signalling devices 12 configured to communicate
   to the activation device 14 additional data. This
                                                   10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

                                - 23
   embodiment is shown including the steps of the embodiment
   of Figure 7a, however it is understood that this is not
   required. Typically, the additional data is generated in
   response to an action of a sensor, and therefore the
 5 method of Figure 7b is particularly suitable for
   embodiments wherein the signalling devices 12 incorporate
   one or more sensors.
   When the end condition is satisfied    (see step 108 of
10 Figure 5),   the signalling device 12 communicates end
   condition information to the activation device 14 related
   to the end condition, at condition transmission step 113.
   Depending on the embodiment, the end condition information
   can include the cause of the end condition and/or an
15 elapsed time between the signalling device 12 being put
   into its enabled state followed by being placed into its
   disabled state   (i.e. an amount of time that its LEDs 38
   were enabled) and/or any other suitable information.
20 The cause of the end condition is useful where more than
   one end condition is possible. For example, the end
   condition could be selected from either the activation of
   a sensor   (such as a proximity sensor) or an elapsed time
   since the LEDs 38 were enabled, and this information is
25 communicated to the activation device 14.     The elapsed
   time is useful where variability in enablement time is
   possible.
   The activation device 14 records the additional data
30 received as a result of the method of Figure 7b.
   Preferably, this additional data is recorded with an
   association to a particular participant. The additional
   data can be recorded into a database implemented within
   the activation device 14. Alternatively, or additionally,
35 the additional data is recorded into a database
   implemented within network attached storage, for example,
   within the cloud.
                                                     10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

                                - 24
    Referring back to Figure 5, the data transmission step 104
    can optionally include configuration data. The
    configuration data comprises data that is in addition to
  5 the identifier of the selected signalling device 12 and
    the instruction to enable the signalling device 12          (as
    already described).  The particular additional data is
    dependent on the implementation, and as will be apparent,
    may or may not be required to be present in each
10  communication from activation device 14 to signalling
    device 12. The following examples can be combined as
    required.
    In a first example, the brightness and/or colour of the
15  LEDs 38 of a  (or each) signalling device 12 is transmitted
    as additional data. Typically, this additional data is
    optional for each transmission, as the signalling devices
    12 have a default brightness setting for when no
    brightness is specified.
20
    In another example, each signalling device 12 comprises,
    in addition to its LEDs 38,   an acoustic module configured
    for producing audible sounds when the signalling device 12
    is put into the enabled state. The activation device 14
25  can send data specifying a volume and/or a type of sound
    and/or an instruction to produce the sound as part of the
    additional data. Again, this additional data is typically
    optional as the signalling devices 12 have a default
    volume and/or sound type and/or default to making the
30  sound or not.
    In yet another example, a LED mode is optionally
    transmitted as additional data. LED mode constitutes the
    manner in which the LEDs operate, for example, one of
35  continuously, blinking, or some other option.
    In general, the additional data is configured through
                                                    10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

                              - 25
   interaction between a user and the activation device 14.
   For example, the activation device 14 can present a
   "configuration" or "options" display enabling the user to
   choose from options provided with the particular
 5 implementation.
   It is envisaged that the activation device 14 can be
   configured to operate the plurality of signalling devices
   12 in an automatic manner. In this operation mode, the
10 activation device 14 is preconfigured to communicate with
   the signalling devices 12 in a predetermined and usually
   sequential manner. A user may "pre-programme" the
   activation device 14 with an intended sequence of
   signalling device 12 activations. A user may also obtain a
15 sequence of signalling device 12 activations from a
   repository of such sequences,  for example as provided on a
   network database. This option enables users of different
   remote signalling systems 10 to share useful sequences
   with one another. The useful sequences can be shared
20 according to known methods, for example, through the use
   of common network storage accessible to multiple users,
   sharing via so-called social media, and through direct
   messaging means such as e-mail.
25 Where the activation device 14 is a portable computing
   device such as a smartphone, it is envisaged that the
   portable computing device can be configured with
   functionality of an activation device 14 through
   installation of suitable software.
30
   Referring to Figure 8, in a variation to the embodiments
   described herein, a signalling device 12 can be a master
   or a slave. Typically, there will be one master signalling
   device 12-M and one or more slave signalling devices 12-S.
35 The master signalling device 12-M is configured for
   receiving the data from the activation device 14 directly.
   The master signalling device 12-M is then configured to
                                                  10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

                               - 26
   communicate the data to the slave signalling devices 12-S.
   This allows for the slave signalling devices 12-S to
   receive the data without directly communicating with the
   activation device 14.
 5
   In an implementation, the master signalling device 12-M
   only communicates the data when it comprises an
   instruction for a slave signalling device 12-S     (i.e. the
   instruction is not for the master signalling device 12-M).
10
   In an embodiment, each signalling device 12 is selectively
   configured as a master or a slave. For example, this may
   be effected by an instruction communicated by the
   activation device 14 to the signalling devices 12,          or by a
15 hardware interface located on the signalling devices 12
    (e.g. a switch). In another embodiment, each signalling
   device 12 is permanently configured as either a master or
   a slave.
20 Modifications and variations as would be apparent to a
   skilled addressee are deemed to be within the scope of the
   present invention. For example, as previously described,
   it is envisaged that the signalling devices 12 can be
   implemented in a number of different shapes and
25 configurations. One possible configuration envisaged
   includes fastening means,  such as Velcro, provided with
   the signalling devices 12 to enable attachment to non
   horizontal surfaces  (such as walls). Another configuration
   is for signalling devices 12 configured as posts,
30 optionally with multiple signalling devices 12 attached to
   a single post. It is also envisaged that the signalling
   device 12 can be provided with attachment points for
   attaching accessory features, such as different coloured
   surfaces to enable easily customised differentiation
35 between different signalling devices 12.
   In another modification, the protective wall 34 is
                                                   10153898_1(GHMaters)P100919.AU.1

                                - 27
    provided with a frosted appearance in order to produce a
    diffuse light when the LEDs 38 are enabled. Alternatively,
    a frosted cap accessory is provided for attachment to the
    protective wall 34 to provide a diffuse light source as
  5 required.
    The signalling device 12 may include a reset button, for
    example interfaced with controller unit 40 or battery unit
    26, configured to enable a reset function  (e.g. causing
10  the signalling module 22 to revert to an initial state).
    In the claims which follow and in the preceding
    description of the invention, except where the context
    requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
15  implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as
    "comprises" or " comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
    i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but
    not to preclude the presence or addition of further
    features in various embodiments of the invention.
