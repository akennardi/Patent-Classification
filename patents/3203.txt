         The present invention relates to medicine intermediates 2,6-dicarboxylic acid
 5 pyridine synthesis method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         2,6-dicarboxylic acid pyridine is mainly used as a competitive inhibitor of bovine
   glutamate dehydrogenase, it can also be used for the preparation of lanthanum and
10 transition metal ligand complex, however, most of the existing synthetic methods are
   using 2,6-dicarboxylic acid pyridine as the reactant, it is complicated and the final yield
   is not very high. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new synthetic method for further
   improving the quality and yield of the product and reducing the byproduct content, it
   has important economic significance.
