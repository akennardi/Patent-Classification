   ABSTRACT
   A concentric rotary fluid machine 100 has a first body 102 and a second body 104 that
   are rotatable relative to each other about a rotation axis 108. The bodies 102, 104 are
 5 coaxially arranged one inside the other and form a working chamber 106 there
   between. A plurality of gates 110 are supported by the second body 104 in respective
   gate pockets 140. Each gate 110 has a gate cylinder 126 at one end and sealing
   portion 128 at an opposite end. Each gate pocket 140 has: a gate retention recess
   142 which receives a gate cylinder 126; a gate seal recess 144 which receives sealing
10 portion 128; and an intervening land 146. The sealing portion 128 reciprocates up and
   down within a corresponding gate seal recess and is always in contact with both the
   recess 144 and the second body 102. A plurality of lobes 112 on the first body cause
   the gates 110 to swing about respective swing axes 114 as the first body rotates
   relative to the second body. The lobes 112 and the lands 146 are configured so that a
15 lobe 112 is able to form a substantial seal against a land 146 when in mutual radial
   alignment.

   CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
 5 This application claims benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Serial No.
   61/864,752 filed August 12, 2013 and entitled "A Rotary Fluid Drive", which is hereby
   incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
   Technical Field
10
   The present disclosure relates in general to concentric rotary fluid machine such as a
   pump or a motor/drive.
   Background Art
15
   Concentric rotary fluid machines may be operated as a pump or alternately as a
   motor/drive. When operated as a pump, external torque is provided to a rotating part
   of the machine which in turn provides positive displacement for fluid thereby providing
   a pumping action. When used as a drive, fluid is pumped through the machine causing
20 one body or component to rotate relative to another thereby providing torque which
   may be used to drive a tool, mechanism, or system. Throughout this specification the
   term "fluid" is to be given its ordinary meaning and includes a liquid, gas, or other
   substance or composition that is able to flow and/or otherwise yields to pressure. Non
   limiting examples of a fluid include, water, oil, liquid air, liquid nitrogen and drilling
25 muds.
   Examples of a type of concentric rotary fluid machine to which the present disclosure
   relates are disclosed in US Patent Nos. 6,280,169; 6,468,061; 6,939,177; and,
   6,976,832 (all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety). This
30 type of machine has a rotor and a stator which are concentrically arranged one inside
   the other to define a working fluid space there between. One of the rotor and stator is
   provided with one or more lobes and the other is provided with or supports one or more
   gates or vanes. Whichever one of the rotor and stator supports the gate is sometimes
   referred to as the "supporting body" of the machine. The other is sometimes referred
35 to as the "non-supporting body" of the machine. When the machine is used for
   example as a drive or a motor, a fluid is pumped through the machine, passes into the
   working fluid space through various inlets, and exits the working space through one or

                                                -2
   more outlets. A moveable gate or vane is always maintained between the inlets and
   outlets to effectively divide the working chamber into alternating high pressure and low
   pressure chambers. The pressure of fluid entering through the inlets acts equally on
   all components within the working chamber and consequently has the effect of causing
 5 the rotor to rotate. This in turn progressively moves the gates or vanes relative to the
   outlets so that eventually the high pressure fluid is itself displaced to a rotationally
   adjacent outlet.
   The efficiency of operation of such a machine, its ease of manufacture and
10 susceptibility to failure is dependent on numerous factors including but not limited to:
   the design and configuration of the gates/vanes that extend into the working fluid
   space; the configuration of the recesses or slots into which the gates or vanes retract
   into when contacted by a passing lobe; the relative configuration and sealing efficiency
   of a lobe against the recess/slot; and friction between relatively moving components.
15
   In a machine having one or more swinging gates, during relative rotation of the rotor
   and stator, when a gate is fully extended contact between a lobe and a gate initially
   occurs at a location adjacent a swing axis of the gate. As rotation continues,
   eventually the lobe contacts a distant free end of the gate. In order to create an
20 effective seal the lobe and the gate must be formed with substantially matching curved
   surfaces to prevent high pressure from leaking between the gate and the lobe to an
   adjacent low pressure side when the lobe and the gate are in mutually radial adjacent
   relationship. This presents challenges in manufacture to produce components to high
   tolerance specifications not only to minimise this pressure leakage but also to facilitate
25 the overall fit of the components that make up the machine.
   Summary of the Disclosure
   The present disclosure teaches a concentric rotary fluid machine having different
30 design features that facilitate greater operational efficiency with increased ease of
   manufacture. One aspect of the disclosed machine is a gate and body configuration
   that enables the gate to seal at an end distant its swing axis against both the
   supporting body and the non-supporting body. A further aspect of the disclosed
   machine is a gate and body configuration that results in a lobe initially contacting a
35 gate at an end distant the swing axis in order to retract the gate into a corresponding
   gate pocket. More particularly a leading ramp of a lobe contacts a sealing portion of a
   gate prior to passing a corresponding swing axis of the gate. As maybe understood by

                                                 -3
   those skilled in the art this represents a gate swing direction directly opposite to that in
   at least the above mentioned prior art machines. In yet a further aspect there is
   disclosed a gate, gate pocket and lobe configuration that enables the lobe to form a
   seal against a supporting body of an associated machine at a location between the
 5 swing axis of the gate and the sealing portion of the gate distant the swing axis.
   In a first aspect there is disclosed a concentric rotary fluid machine comprising:
            first and second bodies, the bodies being coaxially arranged one inside the
   other to define a working chamber there between and wherein the bodies are rotatable
10 one relative to the other about a rotation axis;

   that lies parallel with the rotation axis, each gate having a sealing portion distant its
   corresponding swing axis, each gate pocket being configured to receive the sealing
   portion of a corresponding gate; the gate pockets, sealing portions and non-supporting
20 body being relatively configured such that when the at least one gate is in an extended
   position the sealing portion of the at least one gate forms a substantial seal against
   both the gate pocket and the non-supporting body.
   In one embodiment for each gate, the sealing portion is configured to always at least
25 partially reside within a respective gate pocket during rotation of the bodies relative to
   each other.
   In one embodiment the gate pocket comprises a gate retention recess through which
   the swing axis passes and a gate seal recess within which the gate seal always at

   In one embodiment each gate comprises a retention portion configured to be retained
   within the gate pocket and through which the swing axis passes and two or more arms
   that join the retention portion to a respective sealing portion wherein a space is created

   In one embodiment each gate comprises a retention portion configured to be retained
   within the gate retention recess and two or more arms that join the retention portion to
   a respective sealing portion wherein a space is created between the retention portion
   and the sealing portion.

   gate is in a retracted position with a lobe in radial alignment the land.
   In one embodiment when the machine is operated as a motor the direction of rotation
15 of a gate about a corresponding swing axis to retract the gate into the gate pocket from
   the extended position is the same as the direction of rotation of the non-supporting
   body relative to the supporting body about the rotation axis. However in an alternate
   embodiment when the machine is operated as a pump the direction of rotation of a
   gate about a corresponding swing axis to retract the gate into the gate pocket from the
20 extended position is opposite to the direction of rotation of the non-supporting body
   relative to the supporting body about the rotation axis.

   non-supporting body relative to the supporting body about the rotation axis, each gate
25 is arranged so that a corresponding sealing portion is in advance of the swing axis
   such that a lobe passes the sealing portion of a gate before passing the swing axis of
   the gate. However in a pump embodiment of the machine, with reference to a direction
   of rotation of the non-supporting body relative to the supporting body about the rotation
   axis, each gate is arranged so that a corresponding sealing portion trails the swing axis
30 such that a lobe passes the swing axis of a gate before passing the sealing portion of
   the gate.

   corresponding swing axis, each gate and the bodies being relatively configured such
   that when the at least one gate is in an extended position the sealing portion forms a
   substantial seal against both the supporting and non-supporting body and wherein the
10 gates and lobes are arranged such that on relative rotation of the bodies: when the
   machine is operated as a motor, a leading ramp of the lobes contacts the sealing
   portion of the at least one gate prior to passing a corresponding swing axis of the at
   least one gate; and when the machine is operated as a pump, a leading ramp of the
   lobes contacts the swing axis of the at least one gate prior to passing a corresponding
15 sealing portion of the at least one gate.
   In one embodiment the machine comprises a gate pocket formed in the supporting
   housing for each gate: and when operated as a motor the direction of rotation of a
   gate about a corresponding swing axis to retract the gate into the gate pocket from the
20 extended position is the same as the direction of rotation of the non-supporting body
   relative to the supporting body about the rotation axis; but when operated as a pump,
   the direction of rotation of a gate about a corresponding swing axis to retract the gate
   into the gate pocket from the extended position is opposite the direction of rotation of
   the non-supporting body relative to the supporting body about the rotation axis.
25
   In one embodiment each gate comprises a retention portion configured to be retained
   within the gate pocket and through which the swing axis passes and two or more arms
   that join the retention portion to a respective sealing portion wherein a space is created
   between the retention portion and the sealing portion.

   retention portion is received and a gate seal recess within which the gate seal always
   at least partially resides during rotation of the bodies relative to each other.
35 In one embodiment the supporting body comprises, for each gate pocket, a land
   located between the gate retention recess and gate seal recess.

                                               -6

   Detailed Description of Specific Embodiments
35
   To provide context to and a comparative basis for the presently disclosed machine
   reference is made to Figure 1 depicting a prior art machine. This prior art machine is

                                                  -8
   described in US patent 6,976,832. In brief the machine 10 of Figure 1 comprises a first
   body 12 and a second body 14. The first body 12 is concentric with and disposed
   inside of the second body 14. An annular working chamber 16 is formed between the
   inner body 12 and the outer body 14. The outer body supports a plurality (six) gates
 5 18a - 18f, the inner body 12 on the other hand supports a plurality (in this case three)
   lobes 20a - 20c. The inner body 12 comprises an axial conduit 22 in which is
   disposed a manifold 24. A plurality of inlet ports 26 and outlet ports 28 are formed in
   the conduit 22 to provide fluid communication between the conduit 22 and the working
   chamber 16. The gates 18 are biased by springs 30 toward an extended or sealing
10 position in which a sealing portion 32 of each gate 18 contacts or is in close proximity
   to an outer circumferential surface of the body 12. The sealing portion is at an end of a
   gate 18 distant the swing axis 18. Further the sealing portion 32 when in an extended
   position contacts or lies in close proximity to the body 12 only. The gates 18 are able
   to swing about respective swing axes 34. The swing axes 34 are parallel to a rotation
15 axis 36 about which one of the bodies 12, 14 rotates about the other.
   The body 14 is provided with a gate pocket 38 for each of the gates 18. The gate
   pockets 38 and gates 18 are relatively configured so that when a gate 18 is moved to
   its retracted position it is able to retract sufficiently into the body 14 to enable a
20 contacting lobe 20 to pass thereby. Further, the surface of the gate 18 and surface of
   a contacting passing lobe 20, (for example see gate 18b and lobe 20b) are relatively
   shaped so as to form a substantial seal there between.
   In the machine 10 either one of the bodies 12 and 14 can act as the stator and the
25 other as the rotor. Similarly, the relative disposition of the lobes and gates can be
   changed so that the gates are supported on the inner body 12 and the lobes supported
   on the outer body 14. To accommodate for this interchangeability in relation to which
   body supports the gates and the lobes and which body rotates relative to the other, the
   body that supports the gates will be designated as the supporting body and the other
30 body will be designated as the non-supporting body. Thus in Figure 1 the body 14 is
   the supporting body and the body 12 is the non-supporting body.
   When the machine 10 is operated as a motor or drive, high pressure fluid is supplied to
   one end of the conduit 22. The high pressure fluid is evenly divided by the manifold 24
35 to flow through the inlets 26 and into the working chamber 16. This fluid exerts
   pressure against both the gates 18 and the lobes 20 on either side of the inlets 26. In
   the event that the supporting body 14 is held stationary, this will result in the non-

                                                 -9
   supporting body 12 being rotated in a clockwise direction. Consequently, the lobes 20
   will approach the gates 18 in the direction of rotation so as to contact the gates 18
   initially at a location near their respective swing axes 34 and subsequently pass by the
   free ends 32 which will be retracted into the gate pockets 38. A circumferential tip
 5 surface 33 of a lobe 20 passes the swing axis 34 before it passes the sealing portion
   32 of the gate 18. As the body 12 rotates eventually the high pressure fluid will come
   into communication with the outlet ports 28 resulting in the fluid being vented back into
   the conduit 22 to flow out of the machine 10.
10 Figures 2 - 10 illustrate an embodiment of the concentric rotary fluid machine and
   components thereof in accordance with the present disclosure. The concentric fluid
   rotary machine 100 (herein after referred to in general as "machine 100") comprises a
   first body 102 and a second body 104. The bodies 102, 104 are coaxially arranged
   one inside the other. In this instance, the first body 102 is disposed inside the second
15 body 104. The arrangement of the bodies 102, 104 defines or otherwise forms a
   working chamber 106 between the bodies. As will be explained in greater detail
   hereafter, the working chamber 106 is divided into alternating high and low pressure
   chambers. The bodies 102 and 104 are further arranged so that they are rotatable one
   relative to the other about a rotation axis 108.
20
   It is immaterial to the general principals of operation of a machine 100 which of the
   bodies 102 and 104 is stationary and which one rotates. This is determined by the
   desired application of the machine 100. For example, if the machine 100 were to be
   used in a directional drill of a type described in Applicant's international application no.
25 PCT/AU2013/000432 the outer of the body 104 is stationary and the inner body 102
   rotates. Moreover in such an application the machine 100 is operated as motor or drive
   and the inner body rotates in the clockwise direction. For ease of description in the
   present embodiment it will be assumed that the body 104 is stationary (i.e. constitutes
   a stator) and that the inner body 102 rotates (i.e. constitutes a rotor).
30
   At least one, (and in the present embodiment six) gates 11 Oa - 11 Of (hereinafter
   referred to in general as "gates 110") are supported by one of the first and second
   bodies 102, 104 and in this particular embodiment the second body 104. For
   convenience, the second body 104 will be hereinafter referred to as the "supporting
35 body". Following from this, the first body 102 which does not support the gates 110 will
   be hereinafter referred to as the "non-supporting body 102".

                                              -10
   At least one, (and in this embodiment three) lobes 1 12a - 112c (hereinafter referred to
   in general as "lobes 112") are provided on the non-supporting body 102. The lobes
    112 are evenly spaced about the outer circumferential surface of the non-supporting
   body 102. Each lobe 112 has a circumferential tip surface 113 and opposite leading
 5 and trailing ramps 115 and 117. In the illustrated embodiment each lobe 112is
   asymmetric about a radial line 119 passing midway through the arc of the tip surface
    113. In this embodiment this optimizes efficiency for the designed rotational direction of
   the non-supporting body 102 while also allowing for counter rotation in some
   operational circumstances. The circumferential tip surface 113 is relatively wide in a
10 circumferential direction. This minimizes leakage and pressure loss across the gates
   and gate pockets during operation.
   Each of the gates 110 is supported in the supporting body 104 in a manner to swing
   along a respective swing axis 114a - 114f (hereinafter referred to in general as "swing
15 axis 114" in the singular, or "swing axes 114" in the plural). The swing axes 114 lie
   parallel to the rotation axis 108.
   The non-supporting housing 102 is provided with a plurality of inlet ports 116 and outlet
   ports 118. The non-supporting body 102 is also provided with an inlet flow path Fi and
20 an outlet flow path Fo which are co-axial with each other but fluidically isolated from
   each other within the body 102. In this instance, the isolation is provided by a wall
   portion 120 of the body 102 that physically isolates a downstream end of the inlet flow
   path Fi from an upstream end of the outlet flow path Fo.
25 The inlet ports 116 are formed radially in the body 102 to provide fluid communication
   between the fluid inlet flow path Fi and the working chambers 106. The outlet ports
    118 are also formed radially of the body 102 and provide fluid communication between
   the working chambers 106 and the fluid outlet path Fo.
30 The working chamber 106 is in effect an annular chamber which is segmented into
   three portions by the lobes 112 which form substantial seals against an inner
   circumferential surface of the supporting body 104. Further, the segmented working
   chamber 106 extends in an axial direction between opposite ends of the machine 100.
35 The number of lobes 112 and the number of gates 110 can vary. However, in
   embodiments of the machine 100 there is at least one fluid inlet port 116 and at least
   one fluid outlet port 118 between adjacent lobes 112 at any given time, and at least

                                                - 11
   one gate 110 forming a substantial seal between rotationally adjacent inlet and outlet
   ports at any given time. As a consequence of this, the working chamber 106 is in
   effect divided into alternating high and low pressure chambers 122a, 124a; 122b,
    124b; and 122c, 124c. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that as the
 5 bodies 102 and 104 rotate relative to each other the volumes of the high and low
   pressure chambers vary cyclically from zero to maximum volume.
   The high pressure chambers 122a - 122c (hereinafter referred to in general as "high
   pressure chambers 122") constitute the portions of the working chamber 106 that are
10 in fluid communication with respective inlet ports 116 and bound by the lobe 112
   corresponding to that inlet port, and a fluidically adjacent gate 110. Each low pressure
   chamber 124a - 124c (hereinafter referred to in general as "low pressure chambers
    124") is created in respective parts of the working chamber 106 which are in fluid
   communication with respective outlet ports 118 and bound on opposite sides by a
15 corresponding adjacent lobe 112 and a fluidically adjacent gate 110. For example,
   with reference to Figure 4, a high pressure chamber 122a exists in the working space
    106 which is fed by inlet port 11 6a and bound on either side by the lobe 11 2b and the
   gate 11 Ob. With reference to Figure 5, the low pressure chamber 124a exists in the
   part of the working chamber 106 in fluid communication with the outlet port 11 8a and
20 bound on either side by the lobe 11 2a and the gate 11 Ob.
   The general operation of the machine 10 is as follows. High pressure fluid is supplied
   to the inlet flow path Fi. With reference to Figure 2, this is equivalent to high pressure
   fluid being presented from the right hand side and flowing generally towards the left
25 hand side. The high pressure fluid is communicated via respective inlet ports 116 into
   the respective high pressure chambers 122. In the high pressure chambers 122 the
   pressure of the fluid acts in all directions and thus exerts pressure on both the lobe 122
   and the gate 110 of the respective high pressure chamber 122. In this embodiment,
   the supporting housing 104 is fixed. Thus this pressure results in a rotation of the non
30 supporting body 102 in a clockwise direction.
    It will be appreciated with reference to Figure 5, as the non-supporting body 102
   rotates in the clockwise direction eventually the outlet port 11 8c will pass the gate 11 Of
   and thus form an outlet port for the fluid within the high pressure chamber 122c thereby
35 converting that chamber into a low pressure chamber 124. It will also be appreciated
   that there is no direct communication between the inlet port 116c as this is now rotated
   in a clockwise direction and is isolated from the outlet port 11 8c by the gate 11 Oa

                                               -12
   which has now moved to the extended position forming a substantial seal against the
   smaller diameter portion of the non-supporting body 102 behind the inlet port 11 6c.
   The fluid passing through the outlet ports 118 subsequently flows into the fluid outlet
   path Fo and axially out of the machine 100.
 5
   The configuration of the gates 110, supporting housing 104 and non-supporting
   housing 102 will now be described in greater detail.
   With particular reference to Figures 8 - 10, each gate 110 comprises a retention
10 portion in the form of an elongated gate cylinder 126 and a sealing portion 128. A
   central axis of the cylinder 126 coincides with the swing axis 114 of the gate 110. The
   sealing portion 128 is coupled to the retention portion 126 by way of spaced apart arms
   130. This creates a space or void 132 between the cylinder 126, sealing portion 128,
   and the arms 130.
15
   The sealing portion 128 is configured to form a seal when in the extended position with
   both the supporting housing 104 and the non-supporting 102. To this end the sealing
   portion 128 has a first sealing surface 134 configured to form a substantial seal with
   the supporting housing 104; and a second contiguous sealing surface 136 configured
20 to form a seal against constant diameter outer circumferential surface portions 138 of
   the non-supporting housing 102. The first surface 134 is convexly curved. The second
   surface 136 may be formed with a slight concave curvature to match that of the surface
   portions 138 of the body 102; or alternately may be formed with a generally planar
   surface; or alternately may be formed with a slight convex curvature to provide minimal
25 friction against the body 102.
   The supporting body 104 is formed with a gate pocket 140 for each gate 110. Each
   gate pocket 140 comprises a gate retention recess 142, a gate seal recess 144 and an
   intervening land 146. The land 146 is formed on a free circumferential face of a
30 corresponding radial projection 147 between the recesses 142 and 144 of a gate
   pocket 140. In effect the land 146 forms part of the inner surface of the supporting
   body 104. The retention recess 142 is configured to receive a corresponding gate
   cylinder 126. In particular, the retention recesses 142 have a substantially circular
   cross sectional shape and form a bearing surface for the cylinders 126. Further, the
35 retention recesses 142 are configured to contact a corresponding gate cylinder 126 for
   a substantial portion of the circumference of the cylinder 126, for example at least
   more than 1800, such as about 2000 and preferably between about 2000 and 3000. In

                                              -13
   the present embodiment the recess 142 and cylinder 126 are in contact for about 270.
   The sealing portion 128 reciprocates up and down within a corresponding gate seal
   recess 144 as the gate 110 swings in opposite directions about its swing axis 114.
 5 Each gate seal recess 144 has a radially extending sealing surface 148 that is formed
   with a slight concave curvature of substantially the same radius as the curvature of the
   surface 134. The surfaces 134 and 148 are thus complementary and shaped to form a
   substantial seal there between as the sealing portion 128 reciprocates within its gate
   seal recess 144.
10
   Debris slots 150 and 152 are formed in the gate seal recesses 144 to allow debris that
   may be entrained in the fluid driving the machine 100 to move out of the way of a
   retracting gate seal 128. This minimises the risk of a gate 110 jamming or being held
   partially outside of a corresponding recess 144 as a lobe 112 passes thereby. Such
15 debris is not uncommon in various possible applications of the machine 100 including
   for example as a drive in a mud motor of a down the hole directional drill.
   The debris slot 152 also provides additional clearance for the sealing portion 128 of a
   corresponding gate 110 to allow sufficient over-travel of the gate during its
20 reciprocation should debris or other foreign material pass between the gate 110 and
   the rotor/non supporting body 102. This over-travel allows for significant debris to pass
   through an interface region between the gate 110 and body 102 including the lobes
   112 without locking up the machine 100 should matter become stuck or jammed
   between the body 102 and the gate 110. This also allows manufacturing tolerances on
25 the sealing portion 128 of the gate to be looser in relation to its height. To the
   inventors' best knowledge the prior art does not allow this over-travel of the gates
   travel due to the requirement of close fit matching surfaces to maintain constant
   rotation of the machine. If debris / material were jammed in this area in prior art
   machines they are very likely to lock up. The risk of this is substantially alleviated for
30 the machine 100 due to the above described features.
   The sealing portion 124 is always at least partially retained within the gate seal recess
   144. Also, as shown in Figure 10, each land 146 extends into the space 132 between
   the gate cylinder 126 and sealing portion 128 of a corresponding gate 110. The land
35 146 has a surface 154 facing into the working chamber 106. The surface 154 is
   configured to form a substantial seal against a circumferential tip surface 113 of a
   passing lobe 112. Further the circumferential tip surface 113 is sufficiently wide to

                                               -14
   form a substantial seal with the circumferential surface of the supporting body 104
   facing the working chamber across either one of the gate seal recess 144 or the gate
   retention recess 142. It is further envisaged in some embodiments that the
   circumferential tip surface 113 is sufficiently wide to form a substantial seal with the a
 5 circumferential surface of the supporting body 104 facing the working chamber across
   both of the gate seal recess 144 and the gate retention recess 142 at one particular
   instant in time. Moreover the circumferential tip surface of the lobe is arranged to form
   a substantial seal against the facing surface of the supporting body 104.
10 Figure 10 depicts a gate 110 in an extended position shortly after the passage of a
   trailing edge of a lobe 112 which is moving in the clockwise direction relative to the
   body 104. The inlet port 116 is marginally in advance of the sealing portion 128. Thus
   high pressure fluid is now entering the working chamber forming a high pressure
   chamber 122. On a trailing or left hand side of the sealing portion 128 the working
15 chamber is in communication with an outlet port (not shown) and therefore forms a low
   pressure chamber 124. The high pressure fluid loads the gate 110 primarily to the left
   and into the supporting body 104. In comparison with say gate 18a of the prior art
   machine 10 shown in Figure 1, the high pressure fluid flowing through inlet 26 adjacent
   lobe 20b acts to load the gate 18a in a radial direction and into a corresponding gate
20 retention recess in the body 14 which may cause binding and high friction.
   Embodiments of the current machine 100 with the exemplified gate 110 and supporting
   body 104 substantially increases (in some instances more than doubles) the load
   bearing areas that the gate 110 can react to the supporting body 104 during operation.
25 The gates 110 are provided with biasing means for biasing the gates toward an
   extended position corresponding to a direction in which the sealing portion 128 is
   urged toward the outer circumferential surface of the non-supporting body 102. Such
   biasing means may comprise torsion rod springs that extend into and couple with the
   gate cylinders 126; torsion coil springs; cam bodies; fluid pressure; magnets, or any
30 other suitable mechanical or hydraulic means.
   The lobes 112 are of a width so as to be able to substantially span a gate pocket 140.
   Further, each lobe 112 is of a width so as to be able to form a substantial seal initially
   across a gate seal recess 144 between the land 146 and a portion of the surface of the
35 supporting housing 104 on an opposite side of the gate seal recess 144; and
   subsequently form a seal across a gate retention recess 142 between the land 146 and
   an adjacent portion of the inner surface of the supporting body 104 on an opposite side

                                                - 15
   of the recess 142.
   With particular references to Figures 3 - 5 and 9 - 10 it should be understood that
   when the machine 100 is in use with the supporting body 104 stationary and the non
 5 supporting body 102 rotating, the lobes 112 approach the gates 110 in an opposite
   direction to that in the prior art. In the current embodiments of the machine 100, with
   reference to the direction of rotation of the rotating body (the non supporting body 102),
   the sealing portion 128 of each gate 110 is rotationally in advance of the corresponding
   swing axis 114. Thus for normal operation of the machine 100 upon rotation of the
10 body 102, the lobe 112 initially contacts a gate 110 at a location in advance of the
   corresponding swing axis 114. In comparison with the prior art machine 10 of Figure 1,
   the lobes 20 approach and contact the gates 18 at a location trailing or behind the
   corresponding swing axis 34. More generally for the machine 100 the circumferential
   tip surface 113 of a lobe 112 passes the sealing portion 128 before passing the swing
15 axis 114 irrespective of whether the relative rotation of the bodies 102 and 104 is
   provided by (a) the body 102 rotating clockwise and the body 104 being stationary; or
   equivalently (b) the body 104 rotating counter clockwise and the body 102 being
   stationary. This is directly opposite to the operation of the prior machine 10 where the
   equivalent surface of lobe 20 passes the swing axis 18 before passing the sealing
20 potion of the gate 18. An alternate way of describing this operational characteristic is
   in terms of the leading ramp 115 of a lobe 112. The leading ramp 115 of a lobe will
   contact the sealing portion 128 of a gate 110 prior to passing a corresponding swing
   axis 114 of that gate.
25 Notwithstanding the above, the configuration of the body 102/lobes 112 and gates 110
   allows rotation in either direction when the machine 100 is used as a pump or motor.
   That is, the relative rotation between the bodies 102 and 104 can be reversed from the
   normal or natural direction operational direction. This feature is particularly useful in
   the event that the machine 100 stalls while being driven by an outside or up-hole motor
30 or torque transmitting device (e.g. a top drive / rotary table). The up-hole motor can
   overpower the rotary machine 100 and cause the body 102 to thus change direction
   relative to 104 during operation (motor stall). The machine 100 is not required to
   perform its intended function (e.g. as a motor or a pump) during this event but must
   allow rotation of body 102 in both directions without causing a failure or binding of the
35 parts. To the best of the inventors' knowledge this functionality is not mentioned in or
   possible with the geometry of the machines in at least the prior art. Clearly in the prior
   machine 10 rotating the rotor 12 in an anticlockwise direction will result in jamming

                                               -16
   and/or breaking of the gates 18.
   It will be noted in particular from Figure 3 that when a gate 110 is in a fully retracted
   position there is a very small contact area between the lobe 112 and the gate 110.
 5 The contact is in essence limited to a portion of the surface 136 of the gate seal 128
   and the surface 156 of the lobe 112. This should be contrast with the corresponding
   situation in the prior art machine shown in Figure 1. In order to form a seal in the prior
   art machine 10 it is necessary for the surface of the gate 18 and the surface of the lobe
   20 in contact with the gate to have complementary profiles. This makes the
10 manufacture including the machining of the machine 100 substantially easier than in
   the prior art. In particular, the overall manufacturing tolerance in the machine 100 can
   be loosened as the inner diameter of the non-supporting body 102 is defined only by
   the dimensions of the body 102 itself and not a stack up of the gate and lobes 112.
15 Further the addition of the land 146 allows for the lobes 112 of the body 102 to have a
   constant bearing inner diameter to act against. In this way the bodies 102 and 104 act
   as bearing members themselves. To provide context to the significance of this
   ordinarily machines of a similar nature to the machine 100 are provided with radial
   bearings on either side of the rotor. In some embodiments of the machine 100 radial
20 bearing may also be deployed on either side of the body 102. However significantly
   the provision of such bearings is not essential so that other embodiments of the
   machine 100 may be constructed and operate with the same efficiency without such
   bearings; relying instead on the mutually facing surfaces of the bodies 102 and 104 to
   perform the function of the otherwise provided radial bearing. This may reduce the
25 manufacturing cost and weight of the machine 100 and well as reducing the parts
   count and possible failure modes.
   With particular reference to Figures 4 and 7 the non-supporting body 102 is provided
   with a plurality of pressure equalisation recesses 158 on each leading side of a lobe
30 112 in axial alignment with the exhaust ports 118. The recesses 158 are separated by
   ramps 160 which follow the contour of the leading edge of the lobes 112. The ramps
   160 provide surfaces on which the sealing portions 128 and in particular the surfaces
   136 ride up on relative rotation between the bodies 102 and 104. The recesses 158
   assist in balancing pressure across the gates 110 and in particular the sealing portion
35 128 as the gates ride up the leading edge of the lobes 112 and the exhaust ports 118.
   It will be appreciated that during relative rotation as a lobe 112 approaches a gate 110
   the corresponding low pressure chamber 124 is reducing in volume while the high

                                                 -17
   pressure chamber 122 on an opposite side of the gate has an increasing and relatively
   large volume. The fluid in the high pressure chamber must be vented efficiently to the
   exhaust ports 118 in a relatively short time period to prevent the build-up of excessive
   fluid pressure. This is achieved by the recesses 158 that assist in conveying high
 5 pressure fluid from portions of the high pressure chamber 122 into an adjacent low
   pressure chamber 124 in regions axially distant from the physical location of the outlet
   ports 118.
   Depending on the application of the machine 100 opposite ends thereof will be either
10 closed by annular end plates, or other components of a larger system or device in
   which the machine 100 is incorporated. For example, the machine 100 can be used as
   a direct substitution for the rotary fluid drive (110) in the bearing assembly (100) and in
   the down hole motor (500) described in Applicant's co-pending international application
   no. PCT/AU2013/000432. In such applications the present machine 100 is connected
15 at the end comprising the inlet flow path Fi to a lower end of a bent housing which
   incorporates a fixed or an adjustable bent sub for a directional drill. An opposite end of
   the present machine 100 which incorporates the outlet flow path Fo is coupled with a
   mandrill and via various bearings to a drill bit.
20 However, embodiments of the machine 100 are not limited to use in directional drill
   systems and may be used as stand-alone devices such as a drive when fed with a high
   pressure fluid to provide torque to another machine; or as a pump when one of the
   bodies 102, 104 is driven relative to another. Further, in terms of the salient aspects of
   the machine 100 it is irrelevant which of the housings 102 and 104 rotates and which is
25 stationary, and which one is the supporting body and which is the non-supporting body.
   These aspects have no bearing on the configuration and operation of the gates 110,
   gate pockets 140 and the lobes 112.
   With reference to Figures 2 and 10 when the machine 100 is used as a pump: (a) the
30 non-supporting body 102 rotates in the counter clockwise direction (depicted by
   phantom arrow 170 in Figure 10); and (b) the suction side is at the downhole end 172
   and the pressure side at the up hole end 174. In this pump embodiment fluid enters
   the machine via ports 118 and leaves via ports 116. This flow direction is opposite to
   that depicted by the flow path Fo and Fi in Figure 2. In this embodiment mandrel
35 coupled to the non-supporting body 102 must be driven by an outside power source
   such as directly coupled to an inline motor or engine or via a belt, gear train connected
   to the end to the rotor. If used as a substitute for the machine in application no.

                                               -18
   PCT/AU2013/000432 a belt, gear train, or direct coupling method could drive the
   mandrel (10) to provide the power to turn the rotor counter clockwise. In this case a
   lobe 112 passes the swing axis of a gate 110 first and then passes the sealing portion
   128 of that gate 110.
 5
   Whilst a specific embodiment of the machine 100 has been described, it should be
   apparent that the machine 100 may be embodied in many other forms.
   For example in the present embodiment the inlet ports 116 and outlet ports 118 are
10 separated by a physical barrier in the form of a wall 120 in the body 102. However in
   alternate embodiments, a flow control mechanism may be placed in the wall 120 to
   provide a bypass for at least a portion of the fluid to the working chamber 106. In this
   event at least some of the fluid can flow directly from the inlet flow path Fi to the outlet
   flow path Fo for example in the event of an overpressure condition. Further, while the
15 inlet ports 116 and 118 are axially spaced from each other along the length of the body
   102 in an alternate arrangement, the ports 116 and 118 may be provided along the
   entire length of the body 102 but fluidically separated by a manifold of the type
   described in US patent no. 6,976,832. In another variation the lobes 112 may be
   configured to be symmetrical about its radial line 119. Also in other embodiments the
20 gate may take other physical forms as depicted for example by gate 11 Oa in Figures
   11-13. In Figures 11-13 the same reference numbers are used to denote the same of
   similar features shown and described in relation to the gate 110 of Figure 8. The gate
   11 Oa differs from gate 110 in essence by the addition of a third arm 130i located
   between arms 130 at each of the opposite ends of the gate 11 Oa. The third arm 130i
25 provides increase mechanical strength and rigidity to the sealing portion 128. This
   assists in preventing or minimizing bending of the sealing portion 128. In order to
   accommodate the gate 1 10a modifications are also required to the supporting housing
   104. In particular an intermediate cut out is required in each of the lands 146 and
   corresponding projection 147 to provide space for the intermediate arm 130i when the
30 gate 11 Oa swings between its retracted and extended positions. An example of a cut
   out 149 is shown in phantom line in Figure 6 for the land 146 and projection 147 at the
   six o'clock position only. Naturally if gate 11 Oa is used instead of gate 110 then each
   of the lands 146 and projections 147 will require equivalent cut outs.

30 wherein: when the machine is operated as a motor a direction of rotation of a gate
   about a corresponding swing axis to retract the gate into the gate pocket from the
   extended position is the same as a direction of rotation of the non-supporting body
   relative to the supporting body about the rotation axis; and when the machine is
   operated as a pump the direction of rotation of a gate about a corresponding swing
35 axis to retract the gate into the gate pocket from the extended position is opposite to
   the direction of rotation of the non-supporting body relative to the supporting body
   about the rotation axis.
