                             CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]                    The entire content of the complete specification of Australian Patent
Application No. <removed-apn> as originally filed is incorporated herein by reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
 [0002]                   The present disclosure relates to a waistband for an article of apparel. More
specifically, the present disclosure relates to a waistband that comprises at least one cord
secured to the waistband by an embroidery tunnel formed from a plurality of threads
stitched to the waistband through which the cord can move, the embroidery tunnel
configured to transfer a tensioning force to the waistband.
BACKGROUND
[0003]                    A traditional waistband for an article of apparel such as board shorts often
incorporates a drawstring waistband to secure the article to the wearer.                     Drawstring
waistbands frequently utilize one or more cords traveling through and around the article.
The cord can often be drawn or tightened to increase pressure on the waistband and reduce
the circumference of the waistband, thereby securing the waistband to the wearer.                     A
drawstring waistband is less bulky than a waistband featuring traditional securement
components like snaps, hooks, or zippers. However, drawstring waistbands have a number
of disadvantages including weak securement, minimal distribution of tensioning force
across the waistband, strain on the waistband that weakens the waistband structures, and
wearer discomfort.
BRIEF SUMMARY
[0004]                    This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified
form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not
intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it
intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. The
present invention is defined by the claims.
                                                          1

[0005]                    At a high level, aspects described herein relate to a waistband comprising at
least one cord having a first end secured to the waistband at a first location, a second end
secured to the waistband at a second location, and an intervening portion movably secured
to an inner or outer surface of the waistband. As used throughout this disclosure, the term
"cord" refers to any wire including flywire, cable, lanyard, binding, braid, string, strip,
tape, tie, ligature, line, link, ribbon, rope, stay, strap, or similar structure that can support a
tensioning force applied axially to the cord. The cord may comprise natural or man-made
fibers, including synthetic fibers, an example of which would be nylon. Additionally, the
cord may have stretch or non-stretch properties. The intervening portion may be movably
secured to the waistband with a securing element such as stitching, the securing element
forming an embroidery tunnel that secures the cord to the waistband while permitting the
cord to move within the embroidery tunnel in a direction parallel to the axial direction of
the embroidery tunnel. The ends of the cords may be secured to the waistband with a
secondary backing.
[00061                    The securing element may comprise stitches, filaments, yams, or thread
which can be used to sew a pattern onto a base material. The base material may be an
outer layer of the waistband, with securing element backing located between the outer
layer and an inner layer of the waistband. The embroidery tunnel may form a series of
parallel courses on the waistband. The parallel courses may be parallel to the top and
bottom edges of the waistband and/or parallel to each other. The stitches may further
comprise a plurality of tack-downs coupled to the stitches to prevent unraveling of the
embroidery tunnel. The term "tack-down" as used in this disclosure means a component
attached to an embroidery to prevent unraveling of the embroidery should the stitching
used to form the embroidery become weakened, cut, compromised, or otherwise
unsecured. Each embroidery tunnel may be continuous along the length of the intervening
portion of the cord, and the embroidery tunnels may form a series of parallel courses, or
channels, along all or part of the waistband inner or outer surface. The embroidery tunnels
permit a tensioning force applied to the cord to be distributed evenly across at least a
portion of the waistband. Each embroidery tunnel may form any number of arrangements
and configurations, and may be separate or intermingled with other embroidery tunnels,
                                                          2

and may feature one or many turns. Any and all such variations and any combination
thereof are contemplated as being within the scope herein.
[00071                    In one exemplary aspect, a cord may be secured to the waistband by stitches
forming an embroidery tunnel. Each end of the cord may be affixed to the same end or
opposite ends of the waistband. The intervening portion of the cord may be stitched to the
waistband, the stitches forming an embroidery tunnel. The embroidery tunnel may form
parallel courses or channels, and the courses may be parallel to the top edge and the bottom
edges of the waistband. The cord first end may be affixed to one end of the waistband, and
the cord second end may be affixed to the opposite end of the waistband. The embroidery
tunnel may follow any number of paths or configurations across the waistband, featuring
one or many turns or changes in direction.
[00081                    In another aspect, two cords may be stitched to the waistband with the
stitching configured to form separate embroidery tunnels. A first cord may be secured to
the waistband with the first cord first end and the first cord second end affixed to the first
end of the waistband at a first and second location, respectively. A second cord may be
secured to the waistband second end, the second cord first end and the second cord second
end affixed to the second end of the waistband at a first and second location, respectively.
The intervening portion of each cord may be stitched continuously to the waistband so that
the stitching forms two distinct embroidery tunnels for the first and second cords, the
embroidery tunnels configured to transfer a tensioning force applied to each cord across at
least a portion of the waistband.                      The first and second ends of each cord may also be
affixed to the first and second ends of the waistband, respectively. In other words, each
cord has the ends affixed to opposite ends of the waistband.
[0009]                    In another exemplary aspect, a lanyard or tie is coupled to the first and second
ends of the waistband to allow the wearer to transfer a tensioning force from the lanyard or
tie to each cord and subsequently to the waistband. The lanyard may be connected to each
of the waistband ends through one or more couplings, each coupling connection
comprising an eyelet, aperture, linkage, or other mechanical connection. One or more of
the embroidery tunnels may partially or completely circumscribe the eyelet or couple to the
                                                                3

C:\Interwon\NRPortbl\DCC\GW\17201018_l.docx-28 06 2018
eyelet to allow a tensioning force to be transferred between the lanyard and the cord, and
subsequently to the waistband. The size of the cord, the material from which the cord is
produced, the amount and length of the stitching used to form the embroidery tunnels, the
number and orientation of the embroidery tunnels through which the intervening portion of
the cord travels, and the way in which the tensioning force is transferred between the
coupling and the cord may be varied for desired effect, as would be understood by one
having ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, the distribution of the tensioning force across
the waistband can be varied or optimized for the waistband based on the number and
arrangement of courses provided by the one or more embroidery tunnels.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0029]                    Aspects herein provide for an article of apparel that comprises a waistband
featuring at least one cord affixed at one or both ends of the waistband, and an intervening
portion of the cord stitched to the waistband, the stitches configured to form an embroidery
tunnel across at least a portion of the waistband. The waistband material may comprise a
textile or woven stretch fabric suited for securing stitches, or that is suited for using stitch
backing that can properly support stitching on the waistband material. The waistband may
be formed from an inner layer and an outer layer affixed to each other, the stitch backing
located between the two layers to prevent abrasion against the wearer of the article. Each
cord comprises first and second ends and an intervening portion. The intervening portion
of each cord may be movably coupled to the inner or outer surface of the waistband with
one or a plurality of securing elements, one example being stitches. The stitches may be
used to couple the intervening portion of the cord to the waistband, the stitches configured
to form one or more embroidery tunnels on the inner or outer surface of the waistband.
                                                           6

C:\Interwon\NRPortbl\DCC\GW\17201018_l.docx-28 06 2018
Each embroidery tunnel secures the cord and simultaneously allows the cord to move
within the embroidery tunnel in a direction parallel to the axial direction or path of the
embroidery tunnel. The waistband may further comprise a coupling component connected
to the first end and/or second end of the waistband to allow a tensioning force applied to
the coupling to be transferred to the cord, and subsequently transferred to at least a portion
of the waistband. Because of the configuration of the embroidery tunnels, the tensioning
force is evenly distributed over the extent of the waistband, thereby improving wearer
comfort and fit.
[00301                    In one exemplary aspect, a single cord is secured to the waistband via a single
embroidery tunnel extending across at least a portion of the waistband. The cord first end
may be securely affixed to the waistband first end, and the cord second end may be
securely affixed to the waistband second end. The intervening portion of the cord may be
movably secured or coupled to the outer surface of the waistband using a plurality of
embroidery stitches. The plurality of embroidery stitches may be separated or continuous
across the intervening portion of the cord, and may take a variety of alternating patterns or
arrangements. The plurality of embroidery stitches may form embroidery tunnels that are
substantially continuous from the cord first end to the cord second end, or in other words,
substantially continuous along the intervening portion of the cord. The embroidery tunnel
may allow the cord to move within the tunnel in either direction parallel to the axial
direction of the embroidery tunnel. The embroidery tunnel may comprise a plurality of
turns and may form parallel courses across at least a portion of the waistband.                      The
parallel courses may run back and forth, and may be parallel to the bottom edge and the
top edge of the waistband.
[00311                    In another exemplary aspect, two cords may be stitched to the waistband, the
stitches configured to form two separate embroidery tunnels on an inner or outer surface of
the waistband. In one such example, a first cord and a second cord are used, each cord
having a first end, a second end, and an intervening portion. The first cord first and second
ends may be securely affixed to the waistband at first and second locations, respectively,
the first and second locations corresponding to the first and second ends of the first cord.
The intervening portion of the first cord may be movably affixed to the inner or outer
                                                          7

C:\Interwon\NRPortbl\DCC\GW\17201018_l.docx-28 06 2018
surface of the waistband with a plurality of embroidery stitches, the embroidery stitches
forming a first embroidery tunnel, the first embroidery tunnel configured to allow the first
cord to move within the tunnel in either direction parallel to the axial direction of the first
embroidery tunnel. The second cord first and second ends may be securely affixed to the
waistband second end at a first and second location, respectively, the first and second
locations corresponding to the first and second ends of the second cord. The intervening
portion of the second cord may be movably affixed to the inner or outer surface of the
waistband with a plurality of embroidery stitches, the embroidery stitches forming a
second embroidery tunnel, the second embroidery tunnel configured to allow the second
cord to move within the tunnel in either direction parallel to the axial direction of the
second embroidery tunnel. The first and second ends of the cords may be secured to ends
of the waistband with secondary bartacks, for added securement.
[0032]                    The tunnels may be arranged on the waistband in any number of ways. The
tunnels may comprise a plurality of turns forming different paths or courses over a portion
of the waistband. The tunnels may be arranged such that they form parallel channels or
courses, the parallel channels or courses also may be parallel to the top and bottom edges
of the waistband. The first and second tunnels may be arranged on distinct portions of the
waistband with the courses not intermingled. In one such arrangement, a first tunnel may
be positioned on a first half of the waistband measured from the waistband first end to a
point halfway across the waistband. The second tunnel may be positioned on a second half
of the waistband, the second half of the waistband measured from the waistband second
end to the point halfway across the waistband. There may be a dividing portion between
the first and second embroidery tunnels, the dividing portion containing no embroidery
stitches or tunnels.
[00331                    The embroidery tunnels may be configured or constructed in any number of
ways. The tunnels may movably contain each cord using one long continuous stitch, a
plurality of separate stitches, or a combination of stitches and other securing components.
Separate stitches may be arranged closely or in spaced configuration.              The tunnels may
further comprise a plurality of tack-downs spaced intermittently between the stitching.
The tack-downs may comprise a tightly wound bunching or grouping of stitches that are
                                                       8

C:\Interwon\NRPortbl\DCC\GW\17201018_l.docx-28 06 2018
sufficiently secured to prevent unraveling of the embroidery tunnel should a stitch become
weakened, frayed, cut, or otherwise dislodged or displaced.                      Other commonly known
embroidery tack-downs for apparel may also be used to achieve the same effect. The ends
of the embroidery tunnels may further be secured using a secondary bartack machine. This
secondary bartack secures the ends of the embroidery tunnels and the cords therein in a
fixed position on the waistband.
[0034]                    A top edge of the waistband may also be folded over and bonded, stitched, or
otherwise secured to the inner or outer surface of the waistband to partially cover the
embroidery course and form a smooth edge on the waistband. For example, the top edge
can be folded over to cover the portion of the embroidery tunnel forming a top course on
the outer surface of the waistband. In such an aspect, no tack-downs are required for the
portion of the embroidery tunnel covered by the folded edge of the waistband, as the
folded and secured portion will prevent unraveling of the embroidery courses.
 [00351                   The waistband may be formed from two layers of material, a first outer layer
and a second inner layer, each layer having respective inward and outward facing sides.
The embroidery may be stitched to the outer layer of waistband, with the embroidery on
the outward facing side of the outer layer, and corresponding embroidery backing on the
inward facing side of the outer layer. Because the embroidery backing can be abrasive
against the wearer of the article, the second inner layer is coupled, stitched, glued, or
otherwise bonded to the first outer layer partially or wholly across the waistband cross
section to provide a softer surface against the wearer of the article when the article is in an
as-worn position.
 [00361                   In the following figures, the article of apparel and the waistband are depicted
in accordance with different aspects of the present invention. The articles depicted herein
are only a few examples of suitable articles and are not intended to suggest any limitation
as to the scope of use or functionality of the invention. For example, although shorts are
depicted in the figures, it is contemplated that the apparel item may further comprise pants,
capris, and the like. Neither should the articles be interpreted as having any dependency or
requirement relating any one or combination of elements or characteristics illustrated

therein.              Although some elements are shown in the singular, they may be plural.
Additionally, although some elements are depicted as plural in occurrence, in actuality,
they may be singular. This is true for the description of these elements throughout this
entire disclosure.
[00371                    Looking at FIG. 1, a front elevation view of a waistband 100 is shown, in
accordance with an aspect hereof. As shown in FIG. 1, the waistband 100 comprises a first
end 102 and a second end 104, a waistband inner surface 106, a waistband outer
surface 108, a waistband top edge 110, and a waistband bottom edge 112.                           The
waistband 100 may comprise a woven or knit elastic material, stretchable textile material,
or any other material that is suitable for securing stitching. A first cord 114 is affixed to
the waistband first end 102 at a first location 118 and a second location 120.                   More
specifically, a first end 126 of the first cord 114 is affixed to the waistband first end 102 at
the first location 118, and a second end 128 of the first cord 114 is affixed to the waistband
first end 102 at the second location 120, the cord first end 126 and cord second end 128

the thickness of the waistband material. A lanyard can be threaded through the eyelets 138
to transfer a tensioning force to the first cord 114 as shown more clearly, for example, with
respect to FIG. 5. The first cord 114 is shown as looped around or partially circumscribing
each eyelet 138 such that it can receive a tensioning force applied to the eyelets 138. A
number of tack-downs 136 are used on the first embroidery tunnel 134 to prevent
unraveling of the stitches 130.                        The first embroidery tunnel 134 is located on the outer
surface 108 of the waistband 100 and forms a plurality of parallel courses 140, as seen in
FIG. 2. The parallel courses                           140 are located between the top edge 110 of the
waistband 100 and the bottom edge 112 of the waistband 100, and are substantially parallel
to each other.
[00391                    Looking at FIG. 3, FIG. 3 illustrates a cross-sectional view 300 of the

parallel courses 140 on the first half 146 and second half 148 of the waistband 100 are
separated by a dividing portion 150. As shown, the dividing portion 150 is free of any
embroidery tunnels.                          In other words, the embroidery tunnel 134 and the embroidery
tunnel 144 do not cross the dividing portion 150 in this aspect. The first cord embroidery
tunnel 134 and the second cord embroidery tunnel 144 each have a plurality of turns 142
that act to separate the plurality of parallel courses 140 from each other and act to prevent
the embroidery tunnels 134 and 144 from crossing the dividing portion 150.
