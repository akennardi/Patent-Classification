                                  RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]      This application is a divisional application of Australian Application No.
   2015252985, the original disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                          FIELD
[0002]      This disclosure relates generally to implantable medical devices, and more
   specifically, to implantable devices for connecting tissue layers to create an
   anastomosis. A method of implanting an anastomosis in a patient is also
   provided.
                                    BACKGROUND
[0003]      An anastomosis is a surgical connection between two tissue structures,
   such as blood vessels or intestines. For example, in the context of coronary
   artery bypass graft surgery, a graft vessel is anastomosed to a native coronary
   artery so that blood can flow through the graft vessel.
[0004]      Anastomoses can be created in various manners including, but not limited
   to: end-to-end, end-to-side, and side-to-side anastomoses. Often, suturing is
   used to create such anastomoses.
                                       SUMMARY

                              DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[00046]     Persons skilled in the art will readily appreciate that various aspects of the
   present disclosure can be realized by any number of methods and apparatus
   configured to perform the intended functions. It should also be noted that the
   accompanying drawing figures referred to herein are not necessarily drawn to
   scale, but may be exaggerated to illustrate various aspects of the present
   disclosure, and in that regard, the drawing figures should not be construed as
   limiting.
[00047]     The present disclosure is directed to implantable devices for connecting
   tissue layers, for example, to circumvent a conduit or organ blockage, such as by
   creating a direct passage between tissue structures (e.g. connecting a
   gallbladder and a portion of a gastrointestinal tract) to create an anastomosis that
   facilitates material flow therebetween. The devices described herein are
   endoscopically deployable or deliverable via a catheter and may include self
   expanding apposition mechanisms that facilitate a secure connection between
   the tissue structures (such a connection may also be referred to herein as a
   "shunt," "passageway," "shunt passageway," or "tunnel"). Such design features
   simplify implantation and reduce the likelihood of complications.       In some
   embodiments, the devices provided herein are configured to be removable after
   implantation. As one example, the device is implanted and remains in place until
   the gallbladder and/or its associated ducts are cleared of blockages, after which
   the device is removed. In another example, the device remains implanted until
   the body grows a tissue-anastomosis around the device, and then the device is
   removed. In other embodiments, tissue ingrowth into and/or around the device
   permanently implants the device, and the device is not removed. The devices
   described herein can provide alternative treatments for patients who are not
   suitable candidates for other types of treatments (e.g., gallbladder removal
   surgery) and/or to avoid known complications of other types of treatments (e.g.,
   external biliary drainage).
                                             10

[00048]     This disclosure refers to anastomosis devices in an exemplary fashion. That
   is, it should be understood that the inventive concepts disclosed in this disclosure
   can also be applied to other types of devices. For example, this disclosure also
   provides implantable devices that, in some embodiments, can be used for
   occluding tissue structures, organs, body conduits, blood vessels, the GI tract, and
   the like. For example, in some embodiments the devices provided herein can be
   used to occlude septal defects. In other embodiments, the devices provided
   herein can be used to occlude a patient' s vasculattre or GI tract. In some such
   embodiments, the device does not include a tunnel or central aperture through the
   device. Rather, in some embodiments a covering material seals the device to
   inhibit, modulate, or substantially prevent material from flowing through the device.
[00049]     Referring to FIG. 1, an exemplary anastomosis device 40 in accordance
   with some embodiments provided herein that can be implanted in a patient to
   create a fluidic connection between two organs, spaces, tissue structures,
   conduits, and the like, and combinations thereof is shown. For example, in the
   depicted implementation the anastomosis device 40 is connecting a gallbladder
    10 (that defines an internal gallbladder space 12) with an intestine 20 (that
   defines an internal intestinal space 22). Hence, the anastomosis device 40 is
   acting as a fluidic shunt device between the internal gallbladder space 12 and the
   internal intestinal space 22. Such an implementation may provide a beneficial
   treatment to the patient when, for example, a flow blockage exists in the native
   anatomical conduits connecting the internal gallbladder space 12 and the internal
   intestinal space 22. For example, in some instances the patient may have one or
   more gallstones that cause a blockage of the patient' s cystic duct 14 and/or
   common bile duct 16. In such a case, the anastomosis device 40 can provide a
   fluidic passageway such that bile from the gallbladder 10 can flow into the
   intestine 20. If not for the anastomosis device 40, when bile is blocked from
   flowing out of the gallbladder 10 cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder 10)
   may result.
                                           11

[00050]   While the anastomosis devices provided herein can be used in some
   implementations to relieve or prevent cholecystitis as described above, it should
   be understood that the anastomosis devices provided herein can also be used in
   many other types of implementations within a patient. For example, the
   anastomosis devices provided herein can be used in conjunction with various
   body tissue structures and organs such as, but not limited to, stomachs, colons,
   small intestines, pancreases, blood vessels, bladders, kidneys, conduits, and the
   like.
[00051]   In general, some embodiments of the anastomosis devices provided
   herein (of which anastomosis device 40 is one type of example), include a first
   tissue apposition portion 42a, a second tissue apposition portion 42b, and a
   central portion 44 therebetween. The central portion 44 defines a lumen 46 that
   extends longitudinally from a first end of the anastomosis device 40 to a second
   end of the device 40. The lumen 46 acts as a connection (e.g., a shunt
   passageway) between the internal gallbladder space 12 and the internal intestinal
   space 22, such that the internal gallbladder space 12 is in fluid communication
   with the internal intestinal space 22 via the anastomosis device 40.
[00052]   Referring to FIGS. 2A-2E, an exemplary anastomosis device 200 that
   includes a framework of elongate elements that define a first apposition portion
   202, a second apposition portion 204, and a central portion 206 is depicted. In
   some embodiments, the anastomosis device 200 can be a type of stent device,
   which can refer broadly to devices that include a framework of elongate elements
   and include devices such as, but not limited to, anastomosis devices. The central
   portion 206 is disposed between and interconnects the first apposition portion
   202 and the second apposition portion 204. A covering material (not shown in
    FIGS. 2A-2E) can be disposed on at least some portions of the framework. Such
   covering materials (e.g., covering material and others described below) may also
   be referred to herein merely as a covering.
[00053]   In some embodiments, the central portion 206 can form a body that
   defines a lumen 207 that extends between the first apposition portion 202 and the
                                          12

   second apposition portion 204. The first and second apposition portions 202 and
   204 can form flanges extending substantially radially outward from opposite ends
   of the central portion 206. In some embodiments, the lumen 207 provides an
   anastomosis passageway or tunnel through which biological materials or fluids
   can pass. The device 200 is shown in an expanded configuration (also referred to
   herein as a deployed configuration). The expanded or deployed configuration is
   the configuration that the device 200 naturally exhibits in the absence of external
   forces acting upon the device 200. It should be understood that when the
   anastomosis device 200 is implanted in a patient, the configuration of the device
   200 may be somewhat different than shown because of the external forces from
   the patient' s anatomy that are exerted on the device 200.
[00054]     In some embodiments, the first apposition portion 202, the second
    apposition portion 204, and the central portion 206 are formed of elongate
    elements such as spring wire (e.g., L605 steel or stainless steels), shape memory
    alloy wire (e.g., nitinol or nitinol alloys), super-elastic alloy wire (e.g., nitinol or
    nitinol alloys), or other suitable types of elongate elements or wires, or
    combinations thereof. In some such embodiments, the first apposition portion
    202, the second apposition portion 204, and the central portion 206 can be
   formed from the same piece of precursor material that is cut to create the
   framework of elongate elements. In some such embodiments, the precursor
    material is a tubular material or a sheet material. In some embodiments, different
    types of elongate elements are used at different locations of the first apposition
    portion 202, the second apposition portion 204, and/or the central portion 206. In
    some embodiments, the elongate elements of the first apposition portion 202, the
    second apposition portion 204, and the central portion 206 (or portions thereof)
    may be constructed of polymeric materials.
[00055]     Suitable materials for the elongate elements of the devices provided herein
    include a variety of metallic materials including alloys exhibiting, shape memory,
    elastic and super-elastic characteristics. Shape memory refers to the ability of a
    material to revert to an originally memorized shape after plastic deformation by
                                              13

   heating above a critical temperature. Elasticity is the ability of a material to
   deform under load and return or substantially return to its original shape when the
   load is released. Most metals will deform elastically up to a small amount of
   strain. Super-elasticity refers to the ability of a material to deform under strain to
   much larger degree than typical elastic alloys, without having this deformation
   become permanent. For example, the super-elastic materials included in the
   frames of some anastomosis device embodiments provided herein are able to
   withstand a significant amount of bending and flexing and then return or
   substantially return to the frame' s original form without deformation. In some
   embodiments, suitable elastic materials include various stainless steels which
   have been physically, chemically, and otherwise treated to produce a high
   springiness, metal alloys such as cobalt chrome alloys (e.g., ELGILOYTM,
   MP35N, L605), platinum/tungsten alloys. Embodiments of shape memory and
   super-elastic alloys include the NiTi alloys, ternary shape memory alloys such as
   NiTiPt, NiTiCo, NiTiCr, or other shape memory alloys such as copper-based
   shape memory alloys. Additional materials could combine both shape memory
   and elastic alloys such as a drawn filled tube where the outer layer is constructed
   of nitinol and the inner core is a radiopaque material such as platinum or
   tantalum. In such a construct, the outer layer provides the super-elastic
   properties and the inner core remains elastic due to lower bending stresses.
[00056]    In some embodiments, the elongate elements used to construct the
   devices provided herein can be treated in various ways to increase the
   radiopacity of the devices for enhanced radiographic visualization. In some
   embodiments, the devices are at least partially a drawn-filled type of NiTi
   containing a different material at the core, such as a material with enhanced
   radiopacity. In some embodiments, the devices include a radiopaque cladding or
   plating on at least portions of the first apposition portion, the second apposition
   portion, and the central portion. In some embodiments, one or more radiopaque
   markers are attached to the devices. In some embodiments, the elongate
   elements and/or other portions of the devices provided herein are also visible via
   ultrasound.
                                            14

[00057]     In some embodiments, the first apposition portion 202, the second
   apposition portion 204, and the central portion 206, comprise a framework of
   interconnected elongate elements that is constructed by cutting a tube. In one
   such embodiment, a tube of metallic material (e.g., nitinol, stainless steel, cobalt,
   etc.) is laser cut, and then the tube is expanded and shaped into the desired
   configuration. In some such embodiments, the metallic material is shape-set in
   the desired configuration so that the material receives a shape-memory whereby
   the material will naturally strive to attain the desired configuration. In some
   embodiments, shape memory materials such as nitinol may strive to attain the
   desired configuration when exposed to body temperature.
[00058]    As described in more detail below, in some embodiments a covering
   material can be disposed on or around some portions, or on or around all of the
   first apposition portion 202, the second apposition portion 204, and/or the central
   portion 206. In some embodiments, portions of the first apposition portion 202,
   the second apposition portion 204, and/or the central portion 206 can remain free
   of the covering material. In some embodiments, no covering material is included
   on the anastomosis device 200.
[00059]    The first apposition portion 202 and the second apposition portion 204
   each include a plurality of struts 208. In some embodiments, the struts 208 of
   each of the first and second apposition portions 202 and 204 are configured to
   form, in a general sense, flanges that contact tissue surfaces. More particularly,
   the first apposition portion 202 and the second apposition portion 204 are
   configured to engage one or more layers of tissue therebetween, and to provide
   apposition forces against the tissue surfaces. The apposition forces provided by
   the first and second apposition portions 202 and 204 can facilitate fixation of the
   device 200 to the tissue and provide migration resistance such that the device
   200 can reliably remain positioned at a target site in a patient as desired.
[00060]     In some embodiments, the materials and configuration of the anastomosis
   device 200 (and the other anastomosis device embodiments provided herein)
   allow the devices to be elastically crushed, folded, and/or collapsed into a low
                                            15

   profile delivery configuration for containment within a lumen for transcatheter or
   endoscopic/thorascopic delivery, and to self-expand to an operative size and
   configuration once positioned at a desired target site within a body and deployed
   from the lumen. For example, the anastomosis device 200 can be configured in a
   collapsed delivery configuration in which the plurality of struts 208 are radially
   compressed such that they are forced to extend substantially parallel to the axis
   of the central portion 206, and in which the diameter of the central portion 206 is
   also crushed to become smaller. Due to the use of such materials and structure,
   the device 200 may also exhibit, for example, beneficial fatigue resistance and
   elastic properties.
[00061]    After deployment, the plurality of struts 208 extend from the central portion
   206 at a radial orientation and geometry to exert a desired level of apposition
   pressure on the tissue. In some embodiments, the plurality of struts 208 extend
   from the central portion 206 such that the nominal measure of the angle between
   the struts 208 and the longitudinal axis of the device 200 is about 1000, or about
   900, or about 800, or about 700, or about 600, or about 500, or about 400, or about
   300, or about 200, or about 100, and the like.
[00062]    Still referring to FIGS. 2A-2E, in some embodiments of the anastomosis
   device 200 (and in some embodiments of the other anastomosis devices
   provided herein) the plurality of struts 208 are interconnected by connecting
   members 210. The connecting members 210 are shown in deployed
   configurations in which the connecting members 210 are arranged in a series of
   undulations-each having a vertex 214 extending towards the central portion 206
   and a vertex 215 extending away from the central portion 206. In some
   embodiments, the struts 208 can connect to the connecting members 210 at the
   vertex 214. In other embodiments, the struts 208 can connect to the connecting
   members 210 at the vertex 215.
[00063]    In some embodiments, the connecting members 210 serve to support and
   stabilize the struts 208 to thereby cause the apposition portions 202 and 204 to
   have a more rigid construct. In some such embodiments, the apposition portions
                                           16

   202 and 204 can exert a greater level of apposition pressure while maintain a
   compliancy by which the apposition portions 202 and 204 can conform to the
   anatomical topography of the tissue. In addition, the sealing capabilities of the
   apposition portions 202 and 204 may be enhanced. In some embodiments, the
   stability and support provided by the connecting member 210 serves to increase
   the apposition force provided against the gallbladder or provided against the
   portion of the gastrointestinal tract, for example.
[00064]    In some embodiments, the connecting members 210 combine to form
   circumferential rings 216 and 218 extending circumferentially around a radially
   outer circumference of each of the first and second apposition portions 202 and
   204, respectively. The circumferential rings 216 and 218 can have a shape that is
   wavy or that undulates circumferentially around edges of the first and second
   apposition portions 202 and 204. In some embodiments, the circumferential rings
   216 and 218 can have a shape that undulates in an axial direction, as can be
   seen in FIG. 2A. In some embodiments, the circumferential rings 216 and 218
   can have a shape that undulates in a radial direction, as can be seen in FIG. 2C.
   In some embodiments, the circumferential rings 216 and 218 can have a shape
   that undulates in both axial and radial directions. In some embodiments, the
   circumferential rings 216 and 218 can undulate sinusoidally around the edges of
   one or both of the first and second apposition portions 202 and 204. Forming one
   or both of the circumferential rings 216 and 218 with a sinusoidal, serpentine, or
   otherwise undulating shape can increase an amount of surface area of contact
   between the first and second apposition portions 202 and 204 and tissue, thus
   reducing force at a given location on that tissue.
[00065]    The central portion 206 can include a series of body struts 220, each
   extending longitudinally and forming the central body 206 of the anastomosis
   device 200. The body struts 220 define body cells 222 of the central portion 206
   and separate the respective body cells 222 from circumferentially-adjacent body
   cells 222. In some embodiments, each of the body struts 220 can include a
   plurality of axially-extending portions 224 interconnected with a plurality of angled
                                            17

   portions 226. This can allow the body struts 220 to create a relatively strong
   central portion 206 without necessarily interconnecting the body struts 220 across
   the body cells 222 at several locations along the length of the body struts 220.
[00066]    The struts 208 of the apposition portions 202 and 204 can define flange
   cells 228 between the struts 208. The flange cells 228 can be open cells, with no
   strut separating the flange cells 228 from the central portion 206. As shown in
   FIGS. 2B, 2D, and 2E, the flange cells 228 are closed at a distal-most end of the
   flange cells 228 by connecting members 210 and are open at a center-most end
   of the flange cells 228, such that the flange cells 228 are open to the body cells
   222.
[00067]    FIGS. 2D and 2E show the anastomosis device 200 in a partially-formed
   configuration, prior to forming the anastomosis device 200 in the shape illustrated
   in FIGS. 2A, 2B, and 2C. As shown in FIGS. 2D and 2E, the anastomosis device
   200 can have a substantially cylindrical shape in the partially-formed
   configuration, with the struts 208 extending substantially parallel to the body
   struts 220. The anastomosis device 200 can be shaped in a manufacturing
   process, such as, for example, that described with respect to FIG. 10 (below), to
   transform the anastomosis device 200 from the pre-formed configuration shown
   in FIGS. 2D and 2E to the final configuration shown in FIGS. 2A, 2B, and 2C.
[00068]     In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 200 can be formed in a
   manner such that an elongate member forms a first pattern traversing the central
   portion 206 along a longitudinal axis, the elongate member defines a first flange
   cell 228 of the first apposition portion 202, the elongate member traverses the
   central portion 206 along the longitudinal axis in a second pattern opposing the
   first pattern, the elongate member defines a second opposing flange cell 228, and
   the elongate member then repeats those winding steps to form additional
   patterns of the central portion 206 and flanges cells 228 of the anastomosis
   device 200.
                                           18

[00069]     In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 200 can be formed in a
   manner such that the elongate member defines a flange cell 228 of the first
   apposition portion 202, the elongate member traverses the central portion 206,
   the elongate member defines a flange cell 228 of the second apposition portion
   204, the elongate member traverses the central portion 206, and thereafter the
   elongate member repeats the pattern to form additional flange cells while
   traversing the central portion 206 in between. In some embodiments, each
   successive pattern and each successive flange cell 228 can be out of phase with
   those directly preceding.
[00070]    The central portion 206 is shown in a deployed or expanded configuration
   in FIGS. 2A-2C. In some embodiments, the central portion 206, as described
   above, can include a variety of metallic shape memory materials and super
   elastic alloys. Thus, the central portion 206 can be configured to self-expand to
   the deployed configuration. In some embodiments, the central portion 206 is
   balloon expandable into the deployed configuration. Alternatively, supplemental
   expansion forces can be applied to a self-expandable device by balloon dilation.
   The diameter of the central portion 206 can be made in any size as desired in
   order to suit the intended use and/or delivery system of the anastomosis device
   200. For example, in the low-profile delivery configuration the anastomosis
   device 200 can be disposed within a delivery sheath that has about a 15 Fr. (5
   mm) outer diameter. However, in some embodiments, sheaths that are smaller or
   larger than 15 Fr. can be used. For example, sheaths that have outer diameters
   of 6 Fr., 7 Fr., 8 Fr., 9 Fr., 10 Fr., 11 Fr., 12 Fr., 13 Fr., 14 Fr., 16 Fr., 17 Fr., 18 Fr.,
   19 Fr., 20 Fr., and larger than 20 Fr., can be used in some embodiments. When
   the anastomosis device 200 is configured in its expanded deployed configuration
   as shown, the diameter of the central portion 206 increases to a deployed
   diameter. In some implementations, the deployed outer diameter of the central
   portion 206 is configured to at least partially anchor the device 200 via an
   interference fit with the tissue aperture in which the central portion 206 resides.
   Additionally, when the central portion 206 and the tissue aperture have an
   interference fit relationship, para-device leakage may be reduced or minimized.
                                              19

    In such a case, leakage of the contents of the organs, conduits, and other types
   of tissue structures in which the anastomosis device 200 may be deployed can be
   substantially prevented. For example, when the anastomosis device 200 is used
   between a gallbladder and GI tract (e.g., refer to FIG. 1), leakage into the
   abdominal cavity can be substantially prevented.
[00071]    In some implementations, the deployed outer diameter of the central
   portion 206 is slightly less than the diameter of the tissue aperture in which the
   central portion 206 resides, and the apposition portions 202 and 204 compress
   the tissue to provide the migration resistance. In some embodiments, the fully
   expanded diameter of the central portion 206 is about 30 mm, or about 25 mm, or
   about 20 mm, or about 15 mm, or about 12 mm, or about 10 mm, or about 8 mm,
   or about 6 mm, or about 4 mm, and the like.
[00072]    In some embodiments, one or more portions of the anastomosis device
   200 includes a covering material. For enhanced visualization of the framework of
   the anastomosis device 200, the anastomosis device 200 is shown in FIGS. 2A
   2E without a covering material. In some embodiments, a covering material is
   disposed on at least some portions (or on all) of the first apposition portion 202,
   the second apposition portion 204, and/or the central portion 206. In some
   embodiments, some portions of the first apposition portion 202, the second
   apposition portion 204, and/or the central portion 206 are not covered by the
   covering material.
[00073]    In some embodiments, the covering material is generally fluid
   impermeable. That is, in some embodiments the covering material is made of a
   material that inhibits or reduces passage of blood, bile and/or other bodily fluids
   and materials through the covering material itself. In some embodiments, the
   covering material has a material composition and configuration that inhibits or
   prevents tissue ingrowth and/or endothelialization or epithelialization into the
   covering material. Some such embodiments that are configured to inhibit or
   prevent tissue ingrowth and/or endothelialization can be more readily removed
   from the patient at a future date if so desired. In some embodiments, the
                                          20

   covering material, or portions thereof, has a microporous structure that provides a
   tissue ingrowth scaffold for durable sealing and/or supplemental anchoring
   strength of the anastomosis device 200.
[00074]    In some embodiments, the covering material comprises a fluoropolymer,
   such as an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) polymer, or polyvinylidene
   fluoride (PVDF). In some embodiments, the covering material comprises a
   polyester, a silicone, a urethane, another biocompatible polymer, polyethylene
   terephthalate (e.g., Dacron@), bioabsorbable materials, copolymers, or
   combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the covering material comprises a
   bioabsorbable web. In some other embodiments, the bioabsorbable material may
   also provide an anti-migration feature by promoting attachment between the
   device 200 and tissue until the bioabsorbable material is absorbed.
[00075]    In some embodiments, the covering material (or portions thereof) is
   modified by one or more chemical or physical processes that enhance one or
   more properties of the material. For example, in some embodiments, a
   hydrophilic coating is applied to the covering material to improve the wettability
   and echo translucency of the material. In some embodiments, the covering
   material, or portions thereof, is modified with chemical moieties that facilitate one
   or more of endothelial cell attachment, endothelial cell migration, endothelial cell
   proliferation, and resistance to or promotion of thrombosis. In some
   embodiments, the covering material, or portions thereof, is modified to resist
   biofouling. In some embodiments, the covering material, or portions thereof, is
   modified with one or more covalently attached drug substances (e.g., heparin,
   antibiotics, and the like) or impregnated with the one or more drug substances.
   The drug substances can be released in situ to promote healing, reduce tissue
   inflammation, reduce or inhibit infections, and to promote various other
   therapeutic treatments and outcomes. In some embodiments, the drug
   substance is a corticosteroid, a human growth factor, an anti-mitotic agent, an
   antithrombotic agent, a stem cell material, or dexamethasone sodium phosphate,
   to name some embodiments. In some embodiments, a pharmacological agent is
                                          21

   delivered separately from the covering material to the target site to promote
   tissue healing or tissue growth.
[00076]    Coatings and treatments may be applied to the covering material before or
   after the covering material is joined or disposed on the framework of the
   anastomosis device 200. Additionally, one or both sides of the covering material,
   or portions thereof, may be coated. In some embodiments, certain coatings
   and/or treatments are applied to the covering material(s) located on some
   portions of the anastomosis device 200, and other coatings and/or treatments are
   applied to the material(s) located on other portions of the anastomosis device
   200. In some embodiments, a combination of multiple coatings and/or treatments
   are applied to the covering material, or portions thereof. In some embodiments,
   certain portions of the covering material are left uncoated and/or untreated. In
   some embodiments, the device 200 is fully or partially coated to facilitate or
   frustrate a biological reaction, such as, but not limited to, endothelial cell
   attachment, endothelial cell migration, endothelial cell proliferation, and
   resistance to or promotion of thrombosis.
[00077]    In some embodiments, a first portion of the covering material is formed of
   a first material and a second portion of the covering material is formed of a
   second material that is different than the first material. In some embodiments, the
   covering material includes multiple layers of materials, which may be the same or
   different materials. In some embodiments, portions of the covering material have
   one or more radiopaque markers attached thereto to enhance in vivo
   radiographic visualization of the anastomosis device 200, or one or more
   echogenic areas to enhance ultrasonic visibility.
[00078]    In some embodiments, one or more portions of the covering material are
   attached to the framework of the device 200, such as the central portion 206
   and/or the apposition portions 202 and 204. The attachment can be
   accomplished by a variety of techniques such as, but not limited to, stitching the
   covering material to the framework of the device 200, adhering the covering
   material to the framework of the device 200, laminating multiple layers of the
                                          22

   covering material to encompass portions of the elongate members of the device
   200, using clips or barbs, or laminating multiple layers of the covering material
   together through openings in the framework of the device 200. In some
   embodiments, the covering material is attached to the framework of the device
   200 at a series of discrete locations thereby facilitating the flexibility of the
   framework. In some embodiments, the covering material is loosely attached to
   the framework of the device 200. It is to be appreciated that the covering material
   may be attached to the framework of the device 200 using other techniques or
   combinations of techniques described herein.
[00079]    In some embodiments, the framework of the device 200 (or portions
   thereof) is coated with a bonding agent (e.g., fluorinated ethylene propylene or
   other suitable adhesive) to facilitate attachment of the covering material to the
   framework. Such adhesives may be applied to the framework using contact
   coating, powder coating, dip coating, spray coating, or any other appropriate
   means.
[00080]    The covering material can adapt to changes in the length and/or diameter
   of the central portion 206 in a variety of manners. In a first example, the covering
   material can be elastic such that the covering material can stretch to
   accommodate changes in the length and/or diameter of the device 200. In a
   second example, the covering material can include slackened material in the low
   profile delivery configuration that becomes less slackened or totally unslackened
   when the device 200 is in the expanded configuration. In a third example, the
   covering material can include folded portions (e.g., pleats) that are folded in the
   low-profile configuration and less folded or totally unfolded when the device 200
   is in the expanded configuration. In other embodiments, an axial adjustment
   member is free of covering material. In some embodiments, combinations of
   such techniques, and/or other techniques can be used whereby the covering
   material can adapt to changes in the length and/or diameter of the central portion
   206.

[00081]    FIG. 3A is a flat pattern of an anastomosis device 300 in accordance with
   some exemplary embodiments. In some embodiments, the anastomosis device
   300 can be similar to the anastomosis device 200 described above. For
   example, the anastomosis device 300 includes a framework of elongate elements
   that defines a first apposition portion 302, a second apposition portion 304, and a
   central portion 306. The central portion 306 is disposed between and
   interconnects the first apposition portion 302 and the second apposition portion
   304. In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 300 is formed from a tubular
   material that is cut (e.g., laser cut) and shape-set to a preferred form. Other
   materials and fabrication techniques are also envisioned. A covering material as
   described above (not shown in FIG. 3A) can be disposed on at least some
   portions (or all) of the framework of the anastomosis device 300.
[00082]    The anastomosis device 300 is shown in FIG. 3A as a flat pattern for
   clarity. However, the anastomosis device 300 can be formed into a tubular
   shape, with the central portion 306 forming a substantially cylindrical structure,
   and with the first and second apposition portions 302 and 304 extending outward
   from opposing ends of the central portion 306. In some embodiments, the central
   portion 306 can form a tubular body that defines a lumen that extends between
   the first apposition portion 302 and the second apposition portion 304. The first
   and second apposition portions 302 and 304 can form flanges extending
   substantially radially outward from opposite ends of the central portion 306. In
   some implementations, the lumen defined by the central portion 306 provides an
   anastomosis passageway or tunnel through which biological materials and liquids
   can pass. It should be understood that when the anastomosis device 300 is
   implanted in a patient, the configuration of the device 300 may be somewhat
   different than shown because of the external forces from the patient' s anatomy
   that are exerted on the device 300.
[00083]    In some embodiments, the connecting members 310 combine to form
   circumferential rings 316 and 318 extending substantially circumferentially around
   a radially-outer circumference of each of the first and second apposition portions
                                            24

   302 and 304, respectively. The circumferential rings 316 and 318 can have a
   shape that is wavy or that undulates circumferentially around the outer edges of
   the first and second apposition portions 302 and 304. In some embodiments, the
   circumferential rings 316 and 318 can undulate sinusoidally around the edges of
   one or both of the first and second apposition portions 302 and 304. Forming one
   or both of the circumferential rings 316 and 318 with a sinusoidal, serpentine, or
   otherwise undulating shape can increase an amount of surface area of contact
   between the first and second apposition portions 302 and 304 and tissue, thus
   reducing force at a given location on that tissue. Forming one or both of the
   circumferential rings 316 and 318 with a sinusoidal, serpentine, or otherwise
   undulating shape can also help facilitate crushability (for deployment via a low
   profile) of the first and second apposition portions 302 and 304 while maintaining
   other desirable properties.
[00084]    The central portion 306 can include a series of body struts 320, each
   extending substantially axially and forming the central body of the anastomosis
   device 300. The body struts 320 define body cells 322 of the central portion 306
   and separate the respective body cells 322 from circumferentially-adjacent body
   cells 322. In some embodiments, each of the body struts 320 can include a
   plurality of axially-extending portions 324 interconnected with a plurality of angled
   portions 326. This can allow the body struts 320 to create a relatively strong
   central portion 306 without necessarily interconnecting the body struts 320 across
   the body cells 322 at several locations along the length of the body struts 320.
[00085]    The struts 308 of the apposition portions 302 and 304 can define flange
   cells 328 between the struts 308. In some embodiments, the flange cells 328 are
   open cells (with no strut separating the flange cells 328 from the central portion
   306). In some embodiments, the flange cells 328 are closed at a distal-most end
   of the flange cells 328 by connecting members 310 and are open at a center
   most end of the flange cells 328, such that the flange cells 328 are open to the
   body cells 322. The angled portions 326 can partially separate axially-adjacent
                                          25

   body cells 322 but leave gaps such that each body cells 322 is open to each
   axially-adjacent body cell 322.
[00086]     FIG. 3B is an enlarged view of a single flange cell 328 of the anastomosis
   device 300 in a deployed configuration. FIG. 3C is an enlarged view of a single
   flange cell 328 of the anastomosis device 300 in a crushed configuration. The
   anastomosis device 300 can be elastically crushed, folded, and/or collapsed into
   a low-profile delivery configuration (with the flange cell 328 in the crushed
   configuration illustrated in FIG. 3C) for containment within a lumen for
   transcatheter or endoscopic/thorascopic delivery lumen. In some embodiments,
   the anastomosis device self-expands (upon deployment from the delivery lumen)
   to an operative size and configuration once positioned at a desired target site
   within a body (e.g., the flange cell 328 expands to the deployed configuration as
   illustrated in FIG. 3B).
[00087]     FIG. 3D is an enlarged view of the body cell 322 of the anastomosis device
   300 in a deployed configuration. FIG. 3E is an enlarged view of the body cell 322
   of the anastomosis device 300 in a crushed configuration.
[00088]     The frame of the anastomosis device 300 can be formed using any of the
   materials and techniques described herein. For example, in some embodiments
   the frame of the anastomosis device 300 is formed from a precursor material that
   is cut to create the framework. In some such embodiments, the precursor
   material is a single piece of precursor material such as, but not limited to, a
   tubular material or a sheet material. In some embodiments, the frame of the
   anastomosis device 300 can be formed as a wire-wound structure of a single wire
   or a plurality of wires that form the structures of the first apposition portion 302,
   the second apposition portion 304, and the central portion 306, so as to create
   the open structures of the body cells 322 and the flange cells 328 as well as the
   undulating shape of the circumferential rings 316 and 318. In some
   embodiments, a wire-wound structure may advantageously facilitate functionality
   of the open structures of the body cells 322 and the flange cells 328 as well as
   the undulating shape of the circumferential rings 316 and 318.
                                           26

[00089]    In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 300 can be wire-wound (or
   laser cut) in a manner such that an elongate member forms (i) a first pattern
   traversing the central portion 306 along a longitudinal axis, (ii) a first flange cell
   328 of the first apposition portion 302, (iii) a second pattern traversing the central
   portion 306 along the longitudinal axis opposing the first pattern, (iv) a second
   opposing flange cell 328, and so on. The elongate member can be formed to
   repeat those patterns of the central portion 306 and flanges cells 328 to construct
   a complete anastomosis device 300.
[00090]    In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 300 can be wire-wound (or
   laser cut) in a manner such that the elongate member defines a flange cell 328 of
   the first apposition portion 302, the elongate member traverses the central portion
   306, the elongate member defines a flange cell 328 of the second apposition
   portion 304, the elongate member traverses the central portion 306, and
   thereafter the elongate member repeats the pattern to form additional flange cells
   while traversing the central portion 306 in between. In some such embodiments,
   each successive pattern and flange cell are symmetric to those proceeding.
[00091]    FIG. 4 is a flat pattern of an anastomosis device 400 in accordance with
   other exemplary embodiments. In some embodiments, the anastomosis device
   400 can be similar to the anastomosis devices 200 and 300 described above.
   For example, in some embodiments the anastomosis device 400 includes a
   framework of elongate elements that defines a first apposition portion 402, a
   second apposition portion 404, and a central portion 406. The central portion 406
   is disposed between and interconnects the first apposition portion 402 and the
   second apposition portion 404. A covering material as described above (not
   shown in FIG. 4) can be disposed on at least some portions (or all) of the
   framework.
[00092]    The anastomosis device 400 is shown in FIG. 4 as a flat pattern for clarity.
   However, the anastomosis device 400 can be formed into a tubular form, with the
   central portion 406 forming a substantially cylindrical structure, and with the first
   and second apposition portions 402 and 404 extending outward from opposing
                                           27

   ends of the central portion 406. In some embodiments, the central portion 406
   can form a tubular body that defines a lumen that extends between the first
   apposition portion 402 and the second apposition portion 404. The first and
   second apposition portions 402 and 404 can form flanges extending substantially
   radially outward from opposite ends of the central portion 406. In some
   implementations, the lumen defined by the central portion 406 provides an
   anastomosis passageway or tunnel through which biological materials can pass.
   It should be understood that when the anastomosis device 400 is implanted in a
   patient, the configuration of the device 400 may be somewhat different than
   shown because of the external forces from the patient' s anatomy that are exerted
   on the device 400.
[00093]    In some embodiments, the connecting members 410 combine to form
   circumferential rings 416 and 418 extending substantially circumferentially around
   a radially-outer circumference of each of the first and second apposition portions
   402 and 404, respectively. The circumferential rings 416 and 418 can have a
   shape that is wavy or that undulates circumferentially around edges of the first
   and second apposition portions 402 and 404. In some embodiments, the
   circumferential rings 416 and 418 can have a shape that undulates, as can be
   seen in FIG. 4. In some embodiments, the circumferential rings 416 and 418 can
   undulate sinusoidally along the edges of one or both of the first and second
   apposition portions 402 and 404. Forming one or both of the circumferential rings
   416 and 418 with a sinusoidal, serpentine, or otherwise undulating shape can, in
   some implementations, increase an amount of surface area of contact between
   the first and second apposition portions 402 and 404 and tissue, thus reducing
   the force at a given location on that tissue. Forming one or both of the
   circumferential rings 416 and 418 with a sinusoidal, serpentine, or otherwise
   undulating shape can also help facilitate crushability of the first and second
   apposition portions 402 and 404 while maintaining other desirable properties.
[00094]    The central portion 406 can include a series of body struts 420, each body
   strut extending substantially axially and forming the central body of the
                                          28

   anastomosis device 400. The body struts 420 define body cells 422 of the central
   portion 406 and separate the respective body cells 422 from circumferentially
   adjacent body cells 422. In some embodiments, each of the body struts 420 may
   include a plurality of axially-extending portions 424 interconnected with a plurality
   of angled portions 426. Such a configuration can allow the body struts 420 to
   create a relatively strong central portion 406 without necessarily interconnecting
   the body struts 420 at several locations along the length of the body struts 420.
[00095]    In some embodiments, the struts 408 of the apposition portions 402 and
   404 can define flange cells 428 between the struts 408. In some such
   embodiments, the flange cells 428 can be open cells, with no strut separating the
   flange cells 428 from the central portion 406. The flange cells 428 can be closed
   at a distal-most end of the flange cells 428 by connecting members 410 and can
   be open at a center-most end of the flange cells 428, such that the flange cells
   428 can be open to the body cells 422. As illustrated in FIG. 4, the flange cells
   428 of the first apposition portion 402 are aligned with the body cells 422 and
   open to the body cells 422, and the flange cells 428 of the second apposition
   portion 404 are aligned with the body struts 420 but are askew of the body cells
   422.
[00096]    In some embodiments, the angled portions 426 can partially separate
   longitudinally-adjacent body cells 422 but leave gaps such that each of the body
   cells 422 is open to each longitudinally-adjacent body cell 422.
[00097]    In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 400 can be wire-wound (or
   laser cut) in a manner such that an elongate member forms (i) a first pattern
   traversing the central portion 406 along a longitudinal axis, (ii) a first flange cell
   428 of the first apposition portion 402, (iii) a second pattern traversing the central
   portion 406 along the longitudinal axis opposing the first pattern, (iv) a second
   opposing flange cell 428, and so on. The elongate member can repeat those
   patterns to form all of the central portion 406 and flanges cells 428 of the
   anastomosis device 400.
                                          29

[00098]    In other embodiments, the anastomosis device 400 can be wire-wound (or
   laser cut) in a manner such that the elongate member defines a flange cell 428 of
   the first apposition portion 402, the elongate member traverses the central portion
   406, the elongate member defines a flange cell 428 of the second apposition
   portion 404, the elongate member traverses the central portion 406, and
   thereafter the elongate member repeats the pattern to form additional flange cells
   while traversing the central portion 406 in between. In some embodiments, each
   successive pattern and each successive flange cell 428 can be out of phase with
   those proceeding. In some embodiments, each successive pattern and each
   successive flange cell 428 can be in phase with those proceeding.
[00099]    FIG. 5 is a flat pattern of an anastomosis device 500 in accordance with
   some exemplary embodiments. In some embodiments, the anastomosis device
   500 can be similar to the anastomosis devices 200, 300, and 400 described
   above. For example, the anastomosis device 500 includes a framework of
   elongate elements that defines a first apposition portion 502, a second apposition
   portion 504, and a central portion 506. The central portion 506 is disposed
   between and interconnects the first apposition portion 502 and the second
   apposition portion 504. A covering material as described above (not shown in
   FIG. 5) can be disposed on at least some portions (or on all portions) of the
   framework.
[000100] The anastomosis device 500 is shown in FIG. 5 as a flat pattern for clarity.
   However, the anastomosis device 500 can be formed into a tubular form, with the
   central portion 506 forming a substantially cylindrical structure, and with the first
   and second apposition portions 502 and 504 extending outward from opposing
   ends of the central portion 506. In some embodiments, the central portion 506
   can form a tubular body that defines a lumen that extends between the first
   apposition portion 502 and the second apposition portion 504. The first and
   second apposition portions 502 and 504 can form flanges extending substantially
   radially outward from opposite ends of the central portion 506. In some
   implementations, the lumen defined by the central portion 506 provides an
                                           30

   anastomosis passageway or tunnel through which biological materials can pass.
    It should be understood that when the anastomosis device 500 is implanted in a
   patient, the configuration of the device 500 may be somewhat different than
   shown because of the external forces from the patient' s anatomy that are exerted
   on the device 500.
[000101] In some embodiments, the connecting members 510 combine to form
   circumferential rings 516 and 518 extending substantially circumferentially around
   a radially-outer circumference of each of the first and second apposition portions
   502 and 504, respectively. The circumferential rings 516 and 518 can have a
   shape that is wavy or that undulates circumferentially around edges of the first
   and second apposition portions 502 and 504. In some embodiments, the
   circumferential rings 516 and 518 can have a shape that undulates, as shown in
   FIG. 5. In some such embodiments, the circumferential rings 516 and 518 can
   undulate sinusoidally along the edges of one or both of the first and second
   apposition portions 502 and 504. Forming one or both of the circumferential rings
   516 and 518 with a sinusoidal, serpentine, or otherwise undulating shape may, in
   some implementations, increase an amount of surface area of contact between
   the first and second apposition portions 502 and 504 and tissue, thus reducing
   force at a given location on that tissue. Forming one or both of the
   circumferential rings 516 and 518 with a sinusoidal, serpentine, or otherwise
   undulating shape can also help facilitate crushability to a low-profile delivery
   configuration of the first and second apposition portions 502 and 504 while
   maintaining other desirable properties.
[000102] The central portion 506 can include a series of body struts 520, each body
   strut extending substantially axially and forming the central body of the
   anastomosis device 500. In some embodiments, the body struts 520 define body
   cells 522 of the central portion 506 and separate the respective body cells 522
   from circumferentially-adjacent body cells 522. In some embodiments, each of
   the body struts 520 can include a plurality of axially-extending portions 524
   interconnected with a plurality of angled portions 526. This can allow the body
                                          31

   struts 520 to create a relatively strong central portion 506 without necessarily
   interconnecting the body struts 520 at several locations along the length of the
   body struts 520. The struts 508 of the apposition portions 502 and 504 can
   define flange cells 528 between the struts 508.
[000103] As illustrated in FIG. 5, in some embodiments each column of body cells
   522 is aligned with a flange cell 528 at one end, and is open at an opposite end.
   In some embodiments, the body cells 522 can be axially aligned with and open to
   a gap 530 extending between adjacent struts 508 of one or both of the first and
   second apposition portions 502 and 504. The angled portions 526 can partially
   separate axially-adjacent body cells 522 but can leave gaps such that each body
   cells 522 is open to each axially-adjacent body cell 522.
[000104] In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 500 can be formed in a
   manner such that an elongate member forms (i) a first pattern traversing the
   central portion 506 along a longitudinal axis, (ii) a first flange cell 528 of the first
   apposition portion 502, (iii) a second pattern traversing the central portion 506
   opposing the first pattern, (iv) a second opposing flange cell 528, and so on. In
   some embodiments, the elongate member repeats those patterns to form
   additional portions of the central portion 506 and flanges cells 528 to complete
   the anastomosis device 500.
[000105] In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 500 can be formed in a
   manner such that the elongate member defines a flange cell 528 of the first
   apposition portion 502, the elongate member traverses the central portion 506,
   the elongate member defines a flange cell 528 of the second apposition portion
   504, the elongate member traverses the central portion 506, and thereafter the
   elongate member repeats the pattern to form additional flange cells while
   traversing the central portion 506 in between. In some embodiments, each
   successive pattern and each successive flange cell can be out of phase with
   those directly preceding. In some embodiments, each successive pattern and
   each successive flange cell can be in phase with those directly preceding.
                                          32

[000106] Referring to FIGS. 6A and 6B, the framework 600 of another example
   anastomosis device includes a first apposition portion 602, a second apposition
   portion 604, and a central portion 606. For enhanced visualization of the
   framework 600, the framework 600 is shown without a covering material, however
   covering material(s) as described elsewhere herein can be applied. In FIG. 6A,
   the framework 600 is shown in a low-profile delivery configuration. In FIG. 6B,
   the apposition portions 602 and 604 are shown in their expanded (deployed)
   configurations, while the central portion 606 is still shown in its low-profile
   configuration. When the framework 600 is fully expanded, the central portion 606
   will become radially enlarged (e.g., refer to FIGS. 7A-C).
[000107] The central portion 606 is disposed between the first apposition portion
   602 and the second apposition portion 604. The central portion 606 defines a
   lumen 607 that extends between the first apposition portion 602 and the second
   apposition portion 604. In some embodiments, the lumen 607 provides an
   anastomosis passageway or tunnel through which biological materials and liquids
   can pass.
[000108] The materials, configurations, and techniques for construction of the
   framework 600 (and for the anastomosis devices that utilize framework 600) can
   be the same as those described above in reference to the anastomosis device
   200The first apposition portion 602 and the second apposition portion 604 are
   configured to engage one or more layers of tissue therebetween, and to provide
   apposition forces against the tissue surfaces. The apposition forces provided by
   the first and second apposition portions 602 and 604 can facilitate attachment of
   the framework 600 to the tissue and provide displacement resistance such that
   the framework 600 can reliably remain positioned at a target site in a patient as
   desired.
[000109] The first and second apposition portions 602 and 604 are formed of
   elongate elements in the form of struts 608. In some embodiments, the struts
   608 are configured to naturally form loops or semi-circles after deployment from a
   delivery sheath. In some such embodiments, the deployed apposition portions
                                          33

   602 and 604 are therefore comprised of a plurality of struts that jointly form toroid
   shaped portions that are configured to contact tissue surfaces. In some
   embodiments, the deployed apposition portions 602 and 604 form other shapes
   such as, but not limited to, flanges, petals, hemispherical, and the like.
[000110] In the low-profile delivery configuration, the plurality of struts 608 are
   compressed such that they extend substantially parallel to the central portion 606.
   The materials of device 600 allow the anastomosis devices to be elastically
   crushed, folded, and/or collapsed into a low-profile configuration for containment
   within a lumen for transcatheter or endoscopic/thorascopic delivery, and to self
   expand to an operative size and configuration once positioned at a desired target
   site within a body and deployed from the lumen.
[000111] The central portion 606 includes at least one stent ring 616. As shown, the
   stent rings 616 are aligned with each other along the longitudinal axis of the
   central portion 606. In some embodiments, the stent rings 616 exhibit a
   serpentine pattern. It is to be appreciated that suitable patterns for the devices
   described herein include a variety of shapes and/or patterns. In some
   embodiments, the stent rings 616 are interconnected to each other by at least
   one strut 608 of the apposition portions 602 and 604.
[000112] The central portion 606 is shown in a low-profile configuration. In some
   embodiments, the central portion 606, as discussed above, can include a variety
   of metallic shape memory materials and super-elastic alloys. Thus, the central
   portion 606 can be configured to self-expand to a deployed configuration. In
   some embodiments, the central portion 606 is balloon expandable to a deployed
   configuration. The diameter of the central portion 606 can be made in any size
   as desired in order to suit the intended use and/or delivery system of the
   anastomosis device. For example, the undeployed or low-profile delivery of the
   central portion 606 can be disposed within a delivery sheath that has about a 15
   Fr. (5 mm) outer diameter. However, in some embodiments, sheaths that are
   smaller or larger than 15 Fr. can be used. For example, sheaths that have outer
   diameters of 6 Fr., 7 Fr., 8 Fr., 9 Fr., 10 Fr., 11 Fr., 12 Fr., 13 Fr., 14 Fr., 16 Fr., 17
                                            34

   Fr., 18 Fr., 19 Fr., 20 Fr., and larger than 20 Fr., can be used in some
   embodiments. During deployment, the diameter of the central portion 606 adjusts
   to a deployment diameter. In some embodiments, the deployed diameter of the
   central portion 606 is configured to at least partially anchor the device 600 via an
   interference fit with a tissue aperture. In other embodiments, a distance between
   the apposition portions is configured at least partially to anchor the device 600. In
   some embodiments, the diameter of the central portion 606 increases, e.g., to
   about 30 mm, about 25 mm, about 20 mm, about 15 mm, about 12 mm, about 10
   mm, about 8 mm, about 6 mm, about 4 mm, and the like.
[000113] Referring to FIGS. 7A-7C, another example anastomosis device 700
   includes a framework of elongate elements that defines a first apposition portion
   702, a second apposition portion 704, and a central portion 706. The central
   portion 706 is disposed between and interconnects the first apposition portion
   702 and the second apposition portion 704. A covering material 712 is disposed
   on at least some portions of the framework. In some embodiments, the central
   portion 706 defines a lumen 707 that extends between the first apposition portion
   702 and the second apposition portion 704. In some implementations, the lumen
   707 provides an anastomosis passageway or tunnel through which biological
   materials or liquids can pass. The device 700 is shown in an expanded
   configuration. The expanded configuration is the configuration that the device
   700 naturally exhibits in the absence of external forces acting upon the device
   700. It should be understood that when the anastomosis device 700 is implanted
   in a patient, the configuration of the device 700 may be somewhat different than
   shown because of the external forces from the patient' s anatomy that are exerted
   on the device 700.
[000114] The materials, configurations, and techniques for construction of the
   anastomosis device 700 can be the same as those described above in reference
   to the anastomosis device 200.
[000115] The apposition portions 702 and 704 of the anastomosis device 700 are
   analogous to the apposition portions 602 and 604 described above in reference
                                            35

   to framework 600. The apposition portions 702 and 704 naturally configure
   themselves into the exemplary toriodal shapes shown.
[000116] In some embodiments, the central portion 706 is a cellular construction
   made up of multiple diamond-shaped cells 716 that are interconnected by joints
   714. In other exemplary embodiments, such cells of the central portion 706 may
   have other shapes. In some embodiments, open spaces 710 are defined by the
   diamond-shaped cells 716. It should be understood that the depicted
   configuration of the central portion 706 is just one example, and many other types
   of configurations can be incorporated.
[000117] Referring to FIGS. 8A and 8B, an anastomosis device 800 includes a first
   apposition portion 802, a second apposition portion 804, and a central portion
   806. The device 800 is shown with a covering material 112 (as per any of the
   other covering materials described herein, and attached to the device 800 in any
   of the manners described above). In some embodiments, the covering material
   112 is attached to device 800 to create a single conduit 807. In some
   embodiments, the central portion 806 is covered independently from the
   apposition portions 802 and/or 804 such that cover on the apposition portions are
   distinct from the covering material 112 that creates the central lumen 807. In
   other embodiments, the central portion 806 is covered (or partially covered), while
   the apposition portions 802 and 804 remain free of covering material 112.
[000118] The central portion 806 is disposed between and interconnects the first
   apposition portion 802 and the second apposition portion 804. In some
   embodiments, an additional central end portion 813 extends beyond one or both
   of the apposition portions 802 and 804. The central end portion 813 can extend
   from one or both of the apposition portions 802 and to any desired length. In
   some embodiments, no central end portions 813 are included. Having one or
   both of the central end portion 813 can help to facilitate device removal in some
   cases. For example, an endoscopic grasper can be used to grasp the central
   end portion 813 and remove the device 800.
                                         36

[000119] The central portion 806 defines a lumen 807 that extends between the first
   apposition portion 802 and the second apposition portion 804. In some
   embodiments, the lumen 807 provides an anastomosis passageway or tunnel
   through which biological materials or liquids can pass. The device 800 is shown
   in a deployed (expanded) configuration. The expanded or deployed configuration
   is the configuration that the device 800 or a portion thereof naturally exhibits in
   the absence of external forces acting upon the device 800.
[000120] In some embodiments, the first apposition portion 802, the second
   apposition portion 804, and the central portion 806 can comprise a spring wire
   (e.g., L605 steel or stainless steels), shape memory alloy wire (e.g., nitinol or
   nitinol alloys), super-elastic alloy wire (e.g., nitinol or nitinol alloys), other suitable
   types of wires, or combinations thereof. In some such embodiments, the first
   apposition portion 802, the second apposition portion 804, and the central portion
   806 can be formed from the same piece of precursor material that is cut to create
   the wire structure as desired. For example, in some such embodiments the
   precursor material is a tube (e.g., a nitinol tube) that is laser cut to form the
   desired wire structure. In some embodiments, different types of wires are used at
   different locations of the first apposition portion 802, the second apposition
   portion 804, and/or the central portion 806. In other embodiments, the first
   apposition portion 802, the second apposition portion 804, and the central portion
   806 or portions thereof may be constructed of polymeric materials.
[000121] The first apposition portion 802 and the second apposition portion 804 are
   configured to engage one or more layers of tissue therebetween, and to provide
   apposition forces against the tissue surfaces. The apposition forces provided by
   the first and second apposition portions 802 and 804 can facilitate fixation of the
   device 800 to the tissue and provide displacement resistance such that the
   device 800 can reliably remain positioned at a target site in a patient as desired.
   In the depicted embodiment, each of the first and second apposition portions 802
   and 804 comprise a series of overlapping petals 809 that are collectively
   configured to form, in a general sense, discs that contact tissue surfaces.
                                            37

   Although the discs shown in the depicted embodiment 800 are perpendicular to
   the central portion 806, the discs of first and second apposition portions 802 and
   804 can be formed at non-orthogonal angles to facilitate apposition of varying
   tissue thicknesses and tissue topographies. The discs of first and second
   apposition portions 802 and 804 distribute the apposition pressure to a large
   tissue contact surface area, thereby facilitating apposition of diseased tissue (e.g.
   gangrenous) with minimal force.
[000122] In some embodiments, the first apposition portion 802 and the second
   apposition portion 804 each include a plurality of struts 808 that generally form a
   series of petals 809 having an S-shaped bend. These bends can affect the
   available apposition force and improve the ease of manufacturing. For example,
   during some manufacturing processes of device 800, the device pattern is cut
   from a cylindrical tube and the proximal end of the cut tube is compressed
   towards the distal end of the cut tube. Including an S-shaped bend in the device
   can be advantageous during this process. In other embodiments, increasing the
   number of the petals 809, the amount of overlap, and/or the thickness of the
   struts 808 can increase the available apposition force. In some embodiments,
   the first apposition portion 802 and/or the second apposition portion 804 can be
   formed in different manners (other than the series of petals 809 having an S
   shaped bend). For example, in some embodiments the first apposition portion
   802 and/or the second apposition portion 804 can be formed as loops that
   approximate radial spokes, and the like.
[000123] The number of petals 809 and the percentage of overlap of adjacent petals
   809 can be selected to tailor the apposition force and area as desired. In some
   embodiments, each strut 808 is connected to one rhombus shaped cell on either
   end of the struts 808. In some such embodiments, the diameter of the first and
   second apposition portions 802 and 804 are determined by the length of the
   struts 808 that connects the cells and the angle of twist during manufacturing
   process. The S-shaped struts 808 establish a preferential bending location that
   can affect the shape of the petal 809 during shape setting process. In some
                                          38

   embodiments, the S-shaped struts 808 can provide flexibility in design by not
   having to attach an entire length of frame to graft material and/or not having to
   use an elastomer material for graft. In some embodiments, the S-shaped struts
   808 can permit attachment of relatively thin and flexible material for a relatively
   small device profile. In some embodiments, the S-shaped struts 808 can enable
   collapsibility of the first and second apposition portions 802 and 804, and
   ultimately improve the ability of the device 800 to be loaded within a sheath, and
   deployed via an endoscope working channel.
[000124] When the anastomosis device is configured in its low-profile delivery
   configuration, the plurality of struts 808 are compressed such that they extend
   substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the central portion 806. In some
   embodiments, the materials of device 800 allow the anastomosis devices to be
   elastically crushed, folded, and/or collapsed into a low-profile configuration for
   containment within a lumen for transcatheter or endoscopic/thorascopic delivery,
   and to self-expand to an operative size and configuration once positioned at a
   desired target site within a body and deployed from the lumen. In addition, the
   device 800 may exhibit, for example, beneficial fatigue resistance and elastic
   properties.
[000125] The central portion 806 includes at least one stent ring 816. As shown, the
   stent ring 816 includes a series of interconnected cells 810. During radial
   expansion, the cell 810 expands in the circumferential direction and collapses in
   the longitudinal direction. The radial strength of the central portion 806 can be
   increased by varying the geometry of the stent ring, varying the tube thickness of
   the initial tubular construct, or selecting a stronger material. It should be clear
   that suitable patterns for the devices described herein include a variety of
   different shapes and/or patterns. In some embodiments, the stent rings 816 are
   interconnected to each other by at least one bridge member 812.
[000126] The central portion 806 is shown in an expanded or deployed
   configuration. In some embodiments, the central portion 806, as discussed
   above, can include a variety of metallic shape memory materials and super
                                            39

   elastic alloys. Thus, the central portion 806 can be configured to self-expand to a
   deployed configuration. In some embodiments, the central portion 806 is balloon
   expandable to a deployed configuration. The diameter of the central portion 806
   can be made in any size as desired in order to suit the intended use and/or
   delivery system of the anastomosis device. For example, the undeployed or low
   profile delivery of the central portion 806 can be disposed within a delivery sheath
   that has about a 15 Fr. (5 mm) outer diameter. However, in some embodiments,
   sheaths that are smaller or larger than 15 Fr. can be used. For example, sheaths
   that have outer diameters of 6 Fr., 7 Fr., 8 Fr., 9 Fr., 10 Fr., 11 Fr., 12 Fr., 13 Fr.,
   14 Fr., 16 Fr., 17 Fr., 18 Fr., 19 Fr., 20 Fr., and larger than 20 Fr., can be used in
   some embodiments. The device 800 can be longitudinally stretched to reduce
   the first and second apposition portions 802 and 804 to a smaller diameter. The
   size of the first and second apposition portions 802 and 804 can be reduced to at
   least as small as central portion 806 of the device 800. This reduction in size of
   the first and second apposition portions 802 and 804 enables crushing/crimping
   of the device 800 on to a catheter for endoscopic delivery, for example.
[000127] During deployment, the diameter of the central portion 806 expands to a
   larger diameter. In some embodiments, the deployed diameter of the central
   portion 806 is configured to at least partially anchor the device 800 via an
   interference fit with the tissue aperture. In some embodiments, the diameter of
   the central portion 806 increases, e.g., to about 30 mm, about 25 mm, about 20
   mm, about 15 mm, about 12 mm, about 10 mm, about 8 mm, about 6 mm, about
   4 mm, and the like.
[000128] In other embodiments, a distance between the apposition portions is
   configured at least partially to anchor the device 800. In some embodiments, the
   distance between the apposition portions is less than 5mm, e.g., less than 4 mm,
   less than 3 mm, less than 2 mm, less than 1 mm, and so forth. In some
   embodiments, the distance between the flange member 809 and the flange
   member design can be tailored accommodate tissue conditions pre and post
   drainage. For example, the flanges 809 can be sufficiently flexible and the
                                            40

   distance between the flanges sized so as to avoid pressure necrosis on the
   thicker tissue.
[000129] Referring to FIGS. 9A-9E, an anastomosis device 900 includes a first
   apposition portion 902, a second apposition portion 904, and a central portion
   906 is illustrated. For simplicity, the device 900 is shown without a covering
   material; however, in some embodiments the covering material(s) described
   elsewhere herein can be applied to portions of or all or the frame material. The
   central portion 906 is disposed between the first apposition portion 902 and the
   second apposition portion 904. In some embodiments, the central portion 906
   defines a lumen 907 that extends between the first apposition portion 902 and the
   second apposition portion 904. In some embodiments, the lumen 907 provides an
   anastomosis passageway or tunnel through which biological materials or liquids
   can pass. While in the depicted embodiment the central portion 906 includes a
   single row of cells, in some embodiments two, three, four, five, or more than five
   rows of cells are included. The device 900 is show in a deployed configuration.
   In some embodiments, the expanded or deployed configuration is the
   configuration that the device 900 or a portion thereof naturally exhibits in the
   absence of external forces acting upon the device 900.
[000130] In some embodiments, the first apposition portion 902, the second
   apposition portion 904, and the central portion 906 can comprise a spring wire
   (e.g., L605 steel or stainless steels), shape memory alloy wire (e.g., nitinol or
   nitinol alloys), super-elastic alloy wire (e.g., nitinol or nitinol alloys), other suitable
   types of wire, or combinations thereof. In some such embodiments, the first
   apposition portion 902, the second apposition portion 904, and the central portion
   906 can be formed from the same piece of precursor material that is cut to create
   the wire structure as desired. For example, in some such embodiments the
   precursor material is a tube (e.g., a nitinol tube) that is laser cut to form the
   desired wire structure. In some embodiments, different types of wires are used at
   different locations of the first apposition portion 902, the second apposition
   portion 904, and/or the central portion 906. In some embodiments, the first
                                            41

   apposition portion 902, the second apposition portion 904, and the central portion
   906 or portions thereof may be constructed of polymeric materials.
[000131] The first apposition portion 902 and the second apposition portion 904 are
   configured to engage one or more layers of tissue therebetween, and to provide
   apposition forces against the tissue surfaces. The apposition forces provided by
   the first and second apposition portions 902 and 904 can facilitate attachment of
   the device 900 to the tissue and provide displacement resistance such that the
   device 900 can reliably remain positioned at a target site in a patient as desired.
    In some embodiments, each of the first and second apposition portions 902 and
   904 are configured to form, in a general sense, discs that contact tissue surfaces.
[000132] The first apposition portion 902 and the second apposition portion 904
   each include a plurality of struts 908. The anastomosis device 900 can be
   configured in a collapsed delivery configuration in which the plurality of struts 908
   is compressed such that they extend substantially parallel to the central portion
   906. The device 900 may exhibit, for example, beneficial fatigue resistance and
   elastic properties. In some embodiments, the materials of the device 900 allow
   the anastomosis devices to be elastically crushed, folded, and/or collapsed into a
   low-profile configuration for containment within a lumen for transcatheter or
   endoscopic/thorascopic delivery, and to self-expand to an operative size and
   configuration once positioned at a desired target site within a body and deployed
   from the lumen.
[000133] During deployment, the plurality of struts 908 protrude from the central
   portion 906 at an axial orientation and shape to achieve specific apposing
   pressures on the tissue. In some embodiments, the plurality of struts 908
   protrude from the central portion 906 such the exposed face of the apposition
   portions 902 and 904 is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the
   device 900.
[000134] Still referring to FIGS. 9A-9E, in the depicted embodiment the plurality of
   struts 908 are interconnected by a connecting member 910. The connecting
                                          42

   member 910 is shown in a deployed configuration in which the connecting
   member 910 is arranged in a series of undulations each having a vertex 918
   extending away from the central portion 906. When the anastomosis device 900
   is configured in its low-profile delivery configuration, the measure of the angle at
   the vertex 918 between adjacent the struts 908 is less than the measure of the
   measure of the angle at the vertex 918 between adjacent the struts 908 when the
   anastomosis device 900 is configured in its deployed expanded configuration as
   shown. In some embodiments, the measure of the angle at the vertex 918
   between adjacent the struts 908 decrease when the anastomosis device is
   configured in its low-profile delivery configuration. For example, the measure of
   the angle can be is less than 1000, e.g., less than 900, less than 800, less than
   700, less than 600, less than 500, less than 400, less than 300, less than 200, less
   than 100, and so forth. In some embodiments, the measure of the angle at the
   vertex 918 between adjacent the struts 908 decrease when the anastomosis
   device is configured in its low-profile delivery configuration. For example, the
   angle can be less than 1000, e.g., less than 900, less than 800, less than 700, less
   than 600, less than 500, less than 400, less than 300, less than 200, less than 100,
   and so forth. The stability and support provided by the connecting member 910
   serves to increase the apposition force provided against the gallbladder or
   provided against the portion of the gastrointestinal tract.
[000135] When the anastomosis device is configured in its low-profile delivery
   configuration, a cell 914 expands longitudinally (as shown in FIG. 9E) and, as the
   struts 908 are compressed towards the longitudinal axis, the distance between
   the adjacent vertices 918 is reduced. During deployment, the cell 914 expands
   radially (as shown in Fig. 9D), and the distance between the struts 908 increases.
   In some embodiments, the vertex 918 extends away from the central portion 906
   as the adjacent vertex 918 is compressed together.
[000136] The connecting member 910, as described above, can comprise a variety
   of metallic shape memory materials and super-elastic alloys. Thus, the
   connecting member 910 can be configured to self-expand to an expanded
                                           43

   deployed configuration, e.g., including a pre-determined angle of the vertex 918.
   The connecting member 910 typically operate from closed (nearly aligned) to
   open positions that can be around 90-100 degrees between them, but can be
   made to open less or more than 90-100 degrees in certain configurations.
[000137] Referring to FIG. 10, an exemplary forming mandrel 1000 can be used to
   create some embodiments of the apposition portions of the anastomosis devices
   provided herein. For example, the forming mandrel 1000 can be used to create
   the frame as shown in FIGS. 9A, 9B, and 9C. The winding mandrel 1000 can be
   configured with the dimensional spacing, radii, and angles corresponding to the
   shape of the device 900 as desired. The forming mandrel 900 can also be readily
   modified to create other embodiments of devices having other configurations as
   desired.
[000138] In some embodiments, the mandrel 1000 includes two identical endplates
   1002 and 1004, a shaft 1008, a central bore 1010, and a collar 1006. The
   endplates 1002, 1004, are oriented with the shaft 1008 such that the endplates
   1002, 1004 oppose each other. In some embodiments, the endplates 1002, 1004
   includes a locking mechanism, such as a setscrew, by which the endplates 1002,
   1004 are releasably lockable to the shaft 1008. When the individual locking
   mechanisms are released, the individual endplates 1002 and/or 1004 can be
   axially translated, removed from the shaft 1008, and/or rotated in relation to the
   shaft 1008 and in relation to each other.
[000139] In some embodiments, after the device framework is mounted onto the
   mandrel 1000 as described above, the assembly is heated to shape-set the
   device to its configuration, e.g., a deployed or expanded configuration. In one
   such non-limiting example, the devise is laser cut from a NiTi tube, and the NiTi
   tube in an expanded state on the mounting mandrel 1000 is heated at about 4700
   C for about 8 minutes. In other embodiments, higher or lower temperatures and
   shorter or longer times are used. The heating process will cause the laser cut
   NiTi tube to be heat-set into the deployed shape or the memory shape.
   Accordingly, the laser cut NiTi tube will tend to naturally self-expand to
                                          44

   reconfigure itself to the memory shape when deployed from a delivery sheath to a
   target site within a body. In some embodiments, only a portion of the device is
   heated to a memory shape. For example, only the apposition portions 902 and/or
   904, or the struts 908 are heated.
[000140] In some embodiments, a diameter of the shaft 1008 is the desired
   deployed diameter of the central portion 906. To mount the device framework, at
   least one endplate 1002 or 1004 is removed from the shaft 1008 and the shaft
   1008 is inserted into the lumen of the framework. The removed endplate is re
   attached to the shaft 1008 such that distance between the two endplates 1002
   and 1004 is approximately equal to the desired length of the central portion 906
   of the device. This distance causes end regions of the device to press against
   the endplates 1002 and 1004 and causes the struts 908 to bend and causes the
   connecting member 910 to extend from the longitudinal axis of the device at an
   angle of about 900. The collar 1004 can be secured around the mounted device
   framework (as shown) to constrain the framework in the desired configuration
   until forming is complete.
[000141] Referring to FIGS.11A-11C, an exemplary anastomosis device 100
   includes a framework of elongate elements that defines a first apposition portion
   102, a second apposition portion 104, and a central portion 106. The central
   portion 106 is disposed between and interconnects the first apposition portion
   102 and the second apposition portion 104. A covering material 112 is disposed
   on at least some portions of the framework. Such a covering material (e.g.,
   covering material 112 and others described below) may also be referred to herein
   merely as a covering.
[000142] In some embodiments, the central portion 106 defines a lumen 107 that
   extends between the first apposition portion 102 and the second apposition
   portion 104. In some implementations, the lumen 107 provides an anastomosis
   passageway (i.e., a tunnel) through which biological materials or liquids can pass.
   The device 100 is shown in an expanded configuration (also referred to herein as
   a deployed configuration). The expanded or deployed configuration is the
                                         45

   configuration that the device 100 naturally exhibits in the absence of external
   forces acting upon the device 100. In should be understood that when the
   anastomosis device 100 is implanted in a patient, the configuration of the device
    100 may be somewhat different than shown because of the external forces from
   the patient' s anatomy that are exerted on the device 100.
[000143] The framework of anastomosis device 100 can be made using any of the
   materials and techniques as described above in reference to other anastomosis
   devices. In some embodiments, the first apposition portion 102, the second
   apposition portion 104, and the central portion 106, comprise a framework of
   interconnected elongate elements that is constructed by cutting a tube or a sheet.
    In some such embodiments, a tube of metallic material (e.g., nitinol, stainless
   steel, cobalt, etc.) is laser cut, and then the tube is expanded and shaped into the
   desired configuration. In some such embodiments, the metallic material is shape
   set in the desired configuration so that the material receives a shape-memory
   whereby the material will naturally strive to attain the desired configuration. In
   some embodiments, shape memory materials such as nitinol may strive to attain
   the desired configuration when exposed to body temperature.
[000144] In some embodiments, a covering material 112 can be disposed on some
   portions or on all of the first apposition portion 102, the second apposition portion
    104, and/or the central portion 106. In some embodiments, portions of the first
   apposition portion 102, the second apposition portion 104, and/or the central
   portion 106 can remain free of the covering material 112.
[000145] The first apposition portion 102 and the second apposition portion 104
   each include a plurality of struts 108. In some embodiments, the struts 108 of
   each of the first and second apposition portions 102 and 104 are configured to
   form, in a general sense, discs that contact tissue surfaces. More particularly, the
   first apposition portion 102 and the second apposition portion 104 are configured
   to engage one or more layers of tissue therebetween, and to provide apposition
   forces against the tissue surfaces. The apposition forces provided by the first
   and second apposition portions 102 and 104 can facilitate fixation of the device
                                            46

    100 to the tissue and provide migration resistance such that the device 100 can
   reliably remain positioned at a target site in a patient as desired.
[000146] In some embodiments, the materials and configuration of the anastomosis
   device 100 (and the other anastomosis device embodiments provided herein)
   allow the devices to be elastically crushed, folded, and/or collapsed into a low
   profile delivery configuration for containment within a lumen for transcatheter or
   endoscopic/thorascopic delivery, and to self-expand to an operative size and
   configuration once positioned at a desired target site within a body and deployed
   from the lumen. For example, the anastomosis device 100 can be configured in a
   collapsed delivery configuration in which the plurality of struts 108 are radially
   compressed such that they are forced to extend substantially parallel to axis of
   the central portion 106, and in which the diameter of the central portion 106 is
   also crushed to become smaller. Due to the use of such materials and structure,
   the device 100 may also exhibit, for example, beneficial fatigue resistance and
   elastic properties.
[000147] After deployment, the plurality of struts 108 extend from the central portion
    106 at a radial orientation and geometry to exert a desired level of apposition
   pressure on the tissue. In some embodiments, the plurality of struts 108 extend
   from the central portion 106 such that the nominal measure of the angle between
   the struts 108 and the longitudinal axis of the device 100 is about 1000, or about
   900, or about 800, or about 700, or about 600, or about 500, or about 400, or about
   300, or about 200, or about 100, and the like. In some embodiments, the plurality
   of struts 108 extend from the central portion 106 such that the nominal measure
   of the angle between the struts 108 and the longitudinal axis of the device 200 is
   in a range from about 80 to about 1000, or about 70 to about 900, or about 60 to
   about 800, or about 50 to about 700, or about 40 to about 60, or about 30 to
   about 500, or about 20 to about 400, or about 100 to about 30.
[000148] Still referring to FIGS. 11A-11C, in some embodiments of the anastomosis
   device 100 (and in some embodiments of the other anastomosis devices
   provided herein) the plurality of struts 108 are interconnected by connecting
                                           47

   members 110. The connecting members 110 are shown in deployed
   configurations in which the connecting members 110 are arranged in a series of
   undulations-each having a vertex 114 extending towards the central portion 106
   and a vertex 115 extending away from the central portion 106. In some
   embodiments, the connecting members 110 serve to support and stabilize the
   struts 108 to thereby cause the apposition portions 102 and 104 to have a more
   rigid construct. In some such embodiments, the apposition portions 102 and 104
   can exert a greater level of apposition pressure while maintain a compliancy by
   which the apposition portions 102 and 104 can conform to the anatomical
   topography of the tissue. In addition, the sealing capabilities of the apposition
   portions 102 and 104 may be enhanced. The stability and support provided by
   the connecting member 110 serves to increase the apposition force provided
   against the gallbladder or provided against the portion of the gastrointestinal tract.
[000149] While in the depicted embodiment the connecting members 110 are a
   series of generally linear segments that are joined to form a chevron between
   adjacent struts 108, in some embodiments the connecting members 110
   comprise a continuous wavy or sinusoidal configuration (e.g., a sine wave). For
   example, in some embodiments the connecting members 110 may be linear
   between the struts 108 when the anastomosis device 100 is in its deployed
   configuration. While in the depicted embodiment, the connecting members 110
   extend from the radial ends of the struts 108, in some embodiments the
   connecting members 110 may be attached to or extend from the struts 108 at
   other locations on the struts 108. In some embodiments, two or more sets of
   connecting members 110 can be included (extending from one or more of the
   struts 108).
[000150] When the anastomosis device 100 is configured in its low-profile delivery
   configuration, the measure of the angle defined by the vertices 114 and 115 is
   less than the measure of the angle defined by the vertices 114 and 115 when the
   anastomosis device 100 is configured in its deployed expanded configuration as
   shown. Said another way, as the struts 108 are compressed towards the device' s
                                         48

   longitudinal axis, the distance between the adjacent vertices 114 and 115 is
   reduced. In some embodiments, each vertex 114 extends towards the central
   portion 106 and each vertex 115 extends away from the central portion 106 when
   the anastomosis device 100 is in the collapsed low-profile delivery configuration.
[000151] The connecting member 110, as described above, can comprise a variety
   of materials including, but not limited to, metallic shape memory materials and
   super-elastic alloys. Thus, the connecting members 110 can be configured to
   self-expand to an expanded deployed configuration, e.g., including to a pre
   determined angle of the vertices 114 and 115.
[000152] Referring also to FIG. 11D, the central portion 106 includes one or more
   circumferential stent rings 116 and one or more axial adjustment members 118. It
   should be understood that for enhanced visibility, the central portion 106 is shown
   in FIG. 11D without a covering material. The axial adjustment members 118
   interconnect the stent rings 116. Using this construct, the central portion 106 is
   configured to axially expand or contract in response to tensile forces transferred
   to the central portion 106 from the apposition portions 102 and 104. Such forces
   can be the result of the apposition pressure applied to tissue(s) compressed
   between the apposition portions 102 and 104. Said another way, the axial
   adjustment members 118 can act as suspension springs so that the anastomosis
   device 100 can axially extend or contract to accommodate various thicknesses of
   tissue between the apposition portions 102 and 104. This feature can be
   advantageous, for example, because tissue may be thicker when it is inflamed,
   and may become thinner as it returns to normal (heals). In such a case, the
   anastomosis device 100 can automatically adjust in response to varying tissue
   thicknesses throughout the healing process.
[000153] In the depicted embodiment, two stent rings 116 are included. In some
   embodiments, fewer or more than two stent rings 116 can be included. In the
   depicted embodiment, the stent rings 116 are aligned with each other. That is,
   the peaks and/or valleys of each individual stent ring 116 is positioned in axial
   alignment with the peaks and/or valleys of the other individual stent ring 116.
                                          49

   However, such alignment is not required in all embodiments. In the depicted
   embodiment, the stent rings 116 exhibit a pattern of peaks and valleys in a
   sinusoidal-like pattern. However, it should be clear that the stent rings 116 can
   be configured to have any other suitable geometry. For example, a serpentine
   pattern or a pattern of closed rhombus-shaped cells are suitable in some
   embodiments. The stent rings 116 are interconnected to each other by at least
   one axial adjustment member 118, and the stent rings 116 are connected to the
   struts 108 of the apposition portions 102 or 104.
[000154] The central portion 106 is shown in a deployed or expanded configuration.
   In some embodiments, the central portion 106, as described above, can comprise
   a variety of metallic shape memory materials and super-elastic alloys. Thus, the
   central portion 106 can be configured to self-expand to the deployed
   configuration. In some embodiments, the central portion 106 is balloon
   expandable to the deployed configuration, or supplemental expansion forces can
   be applied to a self-expandable device by balloon dilation. The diameter of the
   central portion 106 can be made in any size as desired in order to suit the
   intended use and/or delivery system of the anastomosis device 100. For
   example, in the low-profile delivery configuration the anastomosis device 100 can
   be disposed within a delivery sheath that has about a 15 Fr. (5 mm) outer
   diameter. However, in some embodiments, sheaths that are smaller or larger
   than 15 Fr. can be used. For example, sheaths that have outer diameters of 6
   Fr., 7 Fr., 8 Fr., 9 Fr., 10 Fr., 11 Fr., 12 Fr., 13 Fr., 14 Fr., 16 Fr., 17 Fr., 18 Fr., 19
   Fr., 20 Fr., and larger than 20 Fr., can be used in some embodiments. When the
   anastomosis device 100 is configured in its expanded deployed configuration as
   shown, the diameter of the central portion 106 increases to a deployed diameter.
   In some implementations, the deployed outer diameter of the central portion 106
   is configured to at least partially anchor the device 100 via an interference fit with
   the tissue aperture in which the central portion 106 resides. However, in some
   implementations the deployed outer diameter of the central portion 106 is slightly
   less than the diameter of the tissue aperture in which the central portion 106
   resides, and the apposition portions 102 and 104 compress the tissue to provide
                                              50

   the migration resistance. In some embodiments, the fully expanded diameter of
   the central portion 106 is about 30 mm, or about 25 mm, or about 20 mm, or
   about 15 mm, or about 12 mm, or about 10 mm, or about 8 mm, or about 6 mm,
   or about 4 mm, and the like. In some embodiments, the fully expanded diameter
   of the central portion 106 is in a range between about 20 mm to about 30 mm, or
   about 15 mm to about 25 mm, or about 10 mm to about 20 mm, or about 5 mm to
   about 15 mm, or about 4 mm to about 8 mm, and the like.
[000155] The one or more axial adjustment members 118 are disposed within the
   central portion 106 so as to interconnect the stent rings 116. In some
   embodiments, the axial adjustment members 118 are configured in an undulating
   or horseshoe-like shape (not shown). The undulations of the axial adjustment
   member 118 extend in directions so that the central portion 106 can axially
   extend as a result of axially extending the axial adjustment members 118 (e.g., by
   causing the axial adjustment members 118 to become more linear). The
   undulations of the axial adjustment members 118 provide a store of excess
   material and/or mechanical energy to facilitate the expansion or contraction of the
   axial length of the device 100.
[000156] The length of the central portion 106 can be made in any dimension as
   desired in order to suit the intended use and/or delivery system of the
   anastomosis device 100. The inclusion of the one or more axial adjustment
   members 118 can allow the anastomosis device 100 to be useable over a range
   of tissue thicknesses, and can advantageously improve contact between the
   tissues for enhancing anastomosis performance. In some embodiments, the
   adjacent stent rings 116 can be longitudinally separated from each other until the
   device reaches an axial adjustment limit, e.g., until the axial adjustment members
   118 appear as a substantially straight line.
[000157] In some implementations, the axial length of the device is at least
   somewhat adjusted before or during deployment, e.g., by a clinician to
   accommodate particular tissue thicknesses at a target implant site. In other
   example implementations, the axial adjustment members 118 automatically
                                          51

   responds to mechanical forces exerted on the deployed device 100 in situ. For
   example, the axial adjustment members 118 may permit the axial length of the
   device 100 to dynamically adjust during deployment and/or during the tissue
   healing process. In one such example implementation in which an anastomosis
   is created between a gallbladder and a duodenum, the gallbladder (if inflamed)
   can have an initial wall thickness that later reduces when the inflammation
   subsides. The axial adjustment members 118 can permit the axial length of the
   device 100 to dynamically adjust from the initial thickness to the later thickness as
   the inflammation of the gallbladder wall subsides.
[000158] The anastomosis device 100 also includes the covering material 112. The
   covering material 112 can be constructed of any of the materials and using any of
   the techniques described above in reference to the covering materials of the
   other anastomosis devices provided herein. In some embodiments, the covering
   material 112 is disposed on at least some portions (or on all) of the first
   apposition portion 102, the second apposition portion 104, and the central portion
   106. In some embodiments, some portions of the first apposition portion 102, the
   second apposition portion 104, and/or the central portion 106 are not covered by
   the covering material 112.
[000159] Referring to FIG. 12, another exemplary anastomosis device 160 includes
   a framework of elongate elements that defines a first apposition portion 162, a
   second apposition portion 164, and a central portion 166. The central portion 166
   is disposed between and interconnects the first apposition portion 162 and the
   second apposition portion 164. A covering material 172 is disposed on at least
   some portions of the framework. In some embodiments, the central portion 166
   defines a lumen 167 that extends between the first apposition portion 162 and the
   second apposition portion 164. In some implementations, the lumen 167
   provides an anastomosis passageway or tunnel through which biological
   materials or liquids can pass. The device 160 is shown in an expanded
   configuration. The expanded configuration is the configuration that the device
                                         52

    160 naturally exhibits in the absence of external forces acting upon the device
    160.
[000160] The materials, configurations, and techniques for construction of the
   anastomosis device 160 can be the same as those described above in reference
   to the other anastomosis devices provided herein. In some embodiments, the
   anastomosis device 160 does not include elongate elements that interconnect the
   struts 168 (in contrast to the connecting members 110 that interconnect the struts
    108 of the anastomosis device 100).
[000161] In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 160 can be constructed to
   have a tailored radial strength by varying design parameters such as the number
   of cells, tube thickness, cell geometry, covering material, and the like. For
   example, in anastomosis device applications the central portion 166 is designed
   to have a radial strength that is resistant to circumferential loading from the
   surrounding tissue. The radial strength of some such anastomosis devices
   facilitates the remodeling of the tissue external to the lumen, and can cause the
   tissue to have a lumen size that approximates the lumen size of the device.
[000162] In some embodiments, the free ends of one or more of the struts 168
   include a member 170. In some embodiments, the member 170 can include an
   anchor, barb, protrusion, atraumatic member, and/or a support scaffold for the
   covering material 172. In some embodiments two or more struts 168 includes
   members 170 that have the differing configurations. In some embodiments, each
   of the struts 168 have members 170 with the same configuration.
[000163] It should be understood that one or more design features of the
   anastomosis devices provided herein can be combined with other features of
   other anastomosis devices provided herein. In effect, hybrid designs that
   combine various features from two or more of the anastomosis device designs
   provided herein can be created, and are within the scope of this disclosure.
                                          53

[000164] In some embodiments the devices provided herein can be used for sealing
   or anchoring a heart valve implant. A heart valve implant enables one-way flow of
   blood from a heart chamber and usually has a first inflow end and a second
   outflow end. The contractions of the heart cause flow of blood through the valve
   from the inflow end to the outflow end. Between the inflow and outflow ends, a
   valve assembly within the heart valve implant provides for one way flow, opening
   to allow flow from the inflow to the outflow end when the pressure of the blood is
   higher on the inflow end, and closing to prevent flow when the pressure on the
   outflow end is higher than the inflow end. In some embodiments, the device
   includes a tunnel or central aperture through the device with apposition portions
   to anchor a valve assembly and seal against backward flow. A valve assembly
   can be attached in the tunnel or central aperture. The apposition portions of the
   device can be configured to be highly conformable to the topography of the heart
   chambers or blood vessels, and compliant with the beating movements of the
   heart. In some embodiments, a covering material is configured to allow flow
   through a valve assembly in the tunnel or aperture while preventing flow around
   the apposition portions.
[000165]          The invention of this application has been described above both
   generically and with regard to specific embodiments. It will be apparent to those
   skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the
   embodiments without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Thus, it is
   intended that the embodiments cover the modifications and variations of this
   invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their
   equivalents.
[000166]           It is to be understood that, if any prior art publication is referred to
   herein, such reference does not constitute an admission that the publication
   forms a part of the common general knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other
   country.
