   1. Field
             The present disclosure relates to a juice extraction module for a juicer.
   2.  Description of the Related Art
20           In general, a juicer includes a main body, and a juice extraction module mounted
   onto the main body.       The juice extraction module includes a container having a juice
   extraction space, a lid having an input port through which a material is input into the
   container, a screw for extracting juice from the material in the container, and a sieve for
   separating juice and residues from each other.
25           The main body includes a driving motor for rotating the screw, and a shaft of the
   driving motor is connected to the screw in the juice extraction module.              In the
   conventional juicer, the material should be chopped into such a size that the screw can
   extract juice.
             As an example, Korean Patent No. 10-0793852 discloses a juicer configured to
30 cut or sever a material by a screw blade protruding from a central axis of a screw toward a

                                                  2
   lateral side of an uppermost end.
             However, in the above technique, when a material has a size larger than the length
   of the screw blade, the material should be chopped in advance into a size smaller than the
   length of the screw blade.
 5           In addition, Korean Patent No. 10-0966607 discloses a juicer having a grater
   provided in an entire upper surface over a screw to crush a material just before juice is
   extracted.
             However, there are problems in that the crush using the grater is achieved at a
   speed higher than an ordinary low speed of the juicer and also a user should press the
10 material against the grater by a large force in order to prevent the rotation of the material
   due to the high speed of the grater.
             Also, since the conventional juicer cuts the material and then mills the cut pieces
   of the material while they are pressed against a sieve in a juice extraction process, the sieve
   may be deformed in a moment by the pressed cut pieces.
15            Such deformation destroys a molding for holding a shape of the sieve or decreases
   the bond between the molding and the sieve to generate a gap between the molding and the
   sieve causing a leakage of residues and a decrease in juice extraction efficiency.
             Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles or the like which
   has been included in the present specification is not to be taken as an admission that any or
20 all of these matters form part of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in
   the field relevant to the present disclosure as it existed before the priority date of each
   claim of this application.
             Throughout this specification the word "comprise", or variations such as
   "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element,
25 integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other
   element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps.
             It would be advantageous to provide a juice extraction module for a juicer that
   reduces or eliminates the inconvenience of requiring that material for juicing be chopped
   or cut before being input into the juice extraction module.

   container 100 formed with a juice discharge port 101, a sieve 200 positioned inside of the
   container 100, a screw 300 positioned inside of the sieve 200 to extract juice from a
   material, and a lid 400 coupled to a top end of the container 100 and formed with a input
   port 410 through which the material is input, the juice extraction module comprising: a
15 crushing portion 500 formed on a top end of the screw 300 to be narrowed upward, the
   crushing portion 500 having a crushing blade 510 formed thereon; and a crushing
   processing portion 600 connected to the input port 410 and formed in a bottom of the lid
   400 to be concave for accommodating the crushing portion 500, wherein an inner surface
   of the crushing processing portion 600 includes a crushing processing surface 610 formed
20 to be increasingly close to the crushing blade 510 in a direction in which the crushing blade
   510 runs from the input port 410, and the crushing blade 510 crushes the material in
   advance within the crushing processing portion 600.
             Also disclosed herein is a juice extraction module for a juicer, which includes a
   container 100 formed with a juice discharge port 101, a sieve 200 positioned inside of the
25 container 100, a screw 300 positioned inside of the sieve 200 to extract juice from a
   material, and a lid 400 coupled to a top end of the container 100 and formed with a input
   port 410 through which the material is input, the juice extraction module including: a
   crushing portion 500 formed on a top end of the screw 300 to be narrowed upward, the
   crushing portion 500 having a crushing blade 510 formed thereon; and a crushing
30 processing portion 600 connected to the input port 410 and formed in a bottom of the lid

                                                     12
   400 to be concave for accommodating the crushing portion 500, wherein an inner surface
    of the crushing processing portion 600 comprises a material guide surface 620 continuing
    from the input port 410 and formed to be inclined toward a central axis of the crushing
   portion 500, whereby the material guide surface 620 guides the material so that a lateral
 5  side of the material begins to be crushed by the crushing blade 510, and the crushing blade
    510 crushes the material in advance within the crushing processing portion 600.
              A conventional juicer has inconvenience and difficulty in that an increase in
    length of a screw blade increases an entire outer diameter of a screw, and thus, a sieve, a
    container and a lid should be manufactured large so as to be fitted to the screw.  However,
10  according to the present disclosure, a material having a diameter larger than a length of a
    screw blade can be used, and the material can be crushed into a size suitable for extracting
   juice without increasing an outer diameter of a screw by a crushing processing portion
    formed to be concave in a bottom of a lid and a crushing portion accommodated in the
    crushing processing portion and cooperating with the crushing processing portion.
15            An embodiment of the present             invention may reduce or eliminate the
    inconvenience and cumbersomeness that a user should chop a material before the material
    is input.
              In addition, in an embodiment disclosed herein, a space between the crushing
   blade and the crushing processing portion may be gradually narrowed and the material may
20 be caught and simultaneously dragged into between the crushing blade and the crushing
   processing portion, so that the material is effectively crushed while being automatically
    supplied to the screw without inconveniently pushing the material.

   in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.
             The following embodiments are provided only for illustrative purposes so that

   implemented in other forms.
             In the drawings, the widths, lengths, thicknesses and the like of elements may be

   portion of the juice extraction module shown in Fig. 1.
             Referring to Figs. 1 to 6, a juice extraction module for a juicer according to one
   embodiment of principles disclosed herein includes a container 100 having a juice
   extraction space defined therein and having a juice discharge port 101 and a residue
25 discharge port 102 respectively formed in one and another sides of an outer surface thereof,
   a sieve 200 installed inside of the container 100 to separate juice from material residues
   generated in juice extraction, a screw 300 installed inside of the sieve 200 to extract juice
   from the material, and a lid 400 installed to a top end of the container 100 and formed with
   an input port 410, through which a material is input.
30           Although not shown, an opening/closing means for selectively opening and

                                                 14
   closing the juice discharge port 101 of the container 100 may be applied to the juice
   extraction module.
            As the opening/closing means, a cock valve may be used.               The cock valve
   includes a valve body moving forward or backward in the juice discharge port 101,
 5 wherein a leading end of the valve body may be oriented toward the juice discharge port
    101.
            In addition, the cock valve may include a juice discharge cock, which may be
   selectively connected to the juice discharge port 101 by the valve body.
            As a means for opening and closing the juice discharge port 101, a variety of
10 means may be employed in addition to the above structure.
            The top end of the screw 300 defines a crushing portion 500 having a shape that
   narrows upwardly.
            The crushing portion 500 has a crushing blade 510 formed thereon, wherein the
   crushing blade 510 extends in the shape of a spiral having a width that gradually narrows
15 upward, toward a top apex of the crushing portion 500.
            A central shaft 310 of the screw 300 may extend from the top apex of the crushing
   portion 500.
            The lid 400 has a crushing processing portion 600 formed in a bottom thereof
   defining a concave extending upward from a face coupled with the container 100 in order
20 to accommodate the crushing portion 500.
            The crushing processing portion 600 has a shape that gradually narrows toward a
   top apex corresponding to the crushing portion 500.
            In addition, the top apex of the crushing processing portion 600 is formed with a
   shaft hole, into which the central shaft 310 of the screw 300 is rotatably fitted.
25          While being connected with the input port 410, the crushing processing portion
   600 cooperates with the crushing portion 500 to serve to crush the material input through
   the input port 410.
            The crushing blade 510 is inserted and positioned in the crushing processing
   portion 600, and the crushing blade 510 cooperates with the shape of an inner surface of
30 the crushing processing portion 600 to crush the material.

                                                  15
             The input port 410 is offset toward one side with respect to a central axis of the
   screw 300 and simultaneously should have such a large bottom width W (or inner
   diameter) that a large-sized material such as an apple is allowed to be input without being
   pre-chopped.
 5           The sieve 200 has the largest inner diameter at the top end thereof, and thus, a
   distance from the central axis of the screw 300 to the sieve 200 is set up to be largest at the
   top end of the sieve 200.
             The bottom width of the input port 410 is set up to be larger than the shortest
   distance from the central axis of the screw 300 to an inner circumferential surface of the
10 top end of the sieve 200.
             Accordingly, as viewed from the top, a region of the input port 410 partially
   overlaps with a top end region of the sieve 200 and is out of the top end region of the sieve
   200.
             In contrast, a conventional juicer has a small-sized input port so as to be generally
15 positioned inside of a region of a sieve.
             Also, the crushing processing portion 600 is formed to cover the entire bottom
   region of the input port 410 at the height of the crushing processing portion 600 connected
   to the bottom end of the input port 410.
             Further, the input port 410 is within a circle region having a diameter
20 corresponding to the diameter of the crushing processing portion 600 with the central shaft
   310 of the screw 300 as the center, and more preferably, is positioned to be offset within
   one side of semicircle regions into which the circle region is divided by a line passing
   through the central shaft 310.
             In addition, the inner surface of the crushing processing portion 600, particularly
25 an inner crushing processing surface 610 is formed to be increasingly close to the crushing
   blade 510 of the crushing portion 500 in a direction in which the crushing blade 510 runs
   from the bottom end of the input port 410.
             Accordingly, when the material is expelled out by the crushing blade 510, the
   material is held by the inner surface of the crushing processing portion 600, so that a lateral
30 side of the material is crushed by the crushing blade 510, and the material is dragged into

                                                  16
   the crushing processing portion according to the rotation of the crushing portion.
             This facilitates automatically crushing the material even if a user inputs the
   material and then does not push the material again.
             The crushing portion 500 further has one or more auxiliary crushing blades
 5 formed thereon, which assist the crushing blade 510 to crush the material more effectively.
             In such a case, the crushing blade 510 first crushes the material, and the auxiliary
   crushing blades may crush the material more finely.
             Also, as the material is dragged into the crushing processing portion, a downward
   force on the screw is generated, so that there is an effect of suppressing upward movement
10 of the screw generated by accumulation of material residues between a bottom surface of
   the screw and a floor surface of the container.
             As mentioned above, a portion of the input port 410 extends out of the top end
   region of the sieve 200. A material guide surface 620 is provided on the inner surface of
   the crushing processing portion 600 to guide the material input through the input port 410
15 toward the sieve 200.
             That is, the material guide surface 620 is provided as an element for smoothly
   connecting the sieve 200 and the input port 410, part of which extends laterally outwardly
   of the sieve, such that an uncut apple can be fed into the input port.
             Also, the material guide surface 620 continues from the input port 410 while
20 overlapping with the input port 410 and is formed to be inclined toward the central axis of
   the crushing portion 500, thereby causing a lateral side of the material to begin to be
   crushed by the crushing blade 510.
             In order to improve crushing processibility, one or more milling blades 630 may
   be further formed on the crushing processing surface 610.
25           In this embodiment, the plurality of milling blades 630 are spaced apart from each
   other and extend from an upper portion of the crushing processing surface 610 to a lower
   portion thereof, and each of the milling blades 630 is increasingly close to the crushing
   blade 510 as it goes from the upper portion toward the lower portion.
             The crushing portion 500 passes over the top end of the container 100 and sieve
30 200 and is accommodated and positioned in the crushing processing portion 600 positioned

                                                  17
   in the lid 400.      The crushing portion 500 and the crushing processing portion 600
   cooperate with each other to crush the material input through the input port 410, thereby
   making it possible to smoothly extract juice from the material even if the user does not
   chop the material in advance.
 5           Since the juice is extracted from the material crushed as above in the sieve 200,
   there is an effect of preventing the sieve 200 from being deformed.
             In addition, a lateral side of the material is processed by the crushing blade 510,
   which is facilitated by forming the crushing portion 500 to have a length suitable for the
   height of the material.    Thus, the protruding length of the screw blade need not extend in
10 order to cut the material itself.
             Further, a sieve insertion step 420 may be formed in a bottom of the crushing
   processing portion 600 to be snugly fitted to the top end of the sieve 200.
             The bottom end of the material guide surface 620 meets the sieve insertion step
   420 in a stepwise manner, wherein the bottom end of the material guide surface 620 is
15 formed to conform to an inner surface of the top end of the sieve 200.
             Accordingly, the material crushed through the crushing processing portion 600 is
   smoothly guided into the sieve 200 along the material guide surface 620.
             As will be apparent from a reading of the present disclosure as a whole:
                 *   the term "concave", when used herein as a noun means a "recess" or to be
20                   "recessed"; and
                 *   the term "crush" means to break up into smaller portions, with a
                     corresponding meaning applying to similar terms, such as "crushing" and
                     "crushed".
             As described above, it can be seen that the illustrated embodiments provide a juice
25 extraction module for a juicer having a structure that facilitates crushing a material in
   advance prior to the material passing to the sieve, which reduces or eliminates an
   inconvenient procedure of needing to chop or cut material before it is input.
                                 INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
30

                                               18

can also be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.
