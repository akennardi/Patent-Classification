    Description
    A microwave oven or a multifunctional oven with microwave heat
    ing function
 5
    The present invention relates to a microwave oven or a multi
    functional oven with a microwave heating function. In particu
    lar, the present invention relates to a multifunctional oven
    with microwave heating function and at least one further heating
 .0 function.
    In a microwave oven or a multifunctional oven with a microwave
    heating function a front frame encloses a front opening of the
    oven cavity. Usually, a gasket is pressed against the front
 .5 frame in a closed state of an oven door. Such a gasket provides
    only steam tightness.
    At standard microwave ovens the front frame is welded to the
    oven cavity or is a part of said oven cavity. This constellation
 !0 avoids microwave leakage at the door. However, heat conduction
    occurs from the oven cavity via the front frame out of the oven.
    This becomes particularly relevant, if the oven has further
    heating functions beside the microwave heating function.
25  It is an object of the present invention to provide a microwave
    oven or a multifunctional oven with a microwave heating func
    tion, wherein the heat conduction via the front frame is re
    duced.
30  The object of the present invention is achieved by the steam
    channel for an exhaust system of a steam appliance according to
    claim 1.
                                    1

      WO 20141114371                                 PCT/EP2013/072149
    The present invention relates to a microwave oven or a multi
    functional oven with microwave heating function, wherein
    -   the oven comprises an oven cavity with an open front side,
    -   the oven comprises a front frame enclosing at least partially
 5      a front portion of the oven cavity,
    -   the oven cavity and the front frame comprise metal sheet in
        each case,
    -   the front frame is connected to the oven cavity by a number
        of fixing elements,
 .0 -   a gap is formed between the oven cavity and the front frame,
    -   the gap encloses at least partially the front portion of the
        oven cavity and the front frame encloses the gap in turn,
    -   the gap is at least partially filled by a gasket,
    -   the oven comprises an oven door covering the open front side
 .5     of the oven cavity and the gap in a closed state of said oven
        door, and
    -   at least a part of the gasket is made of one or more materi
        als having low heat conductivity, so that the front frame is
        thermally decoupled from the oven cavity by said part of the
 !0     gasket and/or by the gap.
    An important aspect of the present invention refers to the gap
    between the oven cavity and the front frame and to the gasket
    that is arranged inside said gap. The front frame is thermally
25  decoupled from the cavity by the gap on the one hand and the
    gasket having reduced heat conductivity on the other hand. The
    gap and the gasket avoid heat conduction from the oven cavity
    via the front frame out of the oven.
30  The gap between the oven cavity and the front frame can have any
    suitable width that allows substantially to reach the aforemen
    tioned aim of the invention. For example, the gap can have a
    width in a range from about 0,1 mm to about 10 mm, in particular
                                    2

      WO 20141114371                                 PCT/EP2013/072149
    in a range from about 1 mm to about 5 mm, preferably a width be
    tween 2 mm and 3 mm, for example a width of 2.5 mm.
    In particular, the fixing elements are screws and/or rivets.
 5
    Further, the front frame comprises a number of lugs aligning at
    the side wall, top wall and/or bottom wall of the oven cavity,
    in particular wherein said lugs align with lugs arranged on at
    least one of side wall, top wall and/or bottom wall, preferably
 .0 wherein said lugs align with lugs arranged on each one of side
    wall, top wall and/or bottom wall.
    Preferably, at least a part of the gasket comprises at least one
    elastic material. The elastic material allows a compensation of
 .5 tolerance between the front frame and the oven door. In general,
    the whole gasket may be made of one or more elastic materials.
    However, at least that portion of the gasket arranged between
    the front frame and the inner side of the oven door is prefera
    bly elastic.
 !0
    In particular, at least a part of the gasket comprises at least
    one electrically conductive material. The electrically conduc
    tive material prevents an infiltration of microwaves into the
    gap between the front frame and the oven cavity. In general, the
25  whole gasket may be electrically conductive. However, at least
    that portion of the gasket arranged within the gap between the
    front frame and the oven cavity preferably comprises electri
    cally conductive material.
30  According to a special embodiment of the present invention a
    front portion and a rear portion of the gasket comprise differ
    ent materials, wherein the front portion comprises at least one
    electrically non-conductive material, while the rear portion
    comprises at least one electrically conductive material.
                                    3

      WO 20141114371                                 PCT/EP2013/072149
    For example, the gasket comprises one or more silicone materi
    als.
 5  Further, the rear portion of the gasket comprises at least one
    silicone material containing small metallic particles mixed into
    said silicone materials. The metallic particles are very small
    and spaced from each other so far that the metallic particles do
    not form a thermal bridge between the cavity and front frame on
 .0 the one hand. The equal distribution of the metallic particles
    causes a similar function as a metal grid.
    Preferably, at least a part of the rear portion of the gasket
    fills the gap.
 .5
    In particular, the gasket is formed as a single-piece part.
    Moreover, the oven door may comprise a wave choke system extend
    ing in an outer portion of said oven door, so that the wave
 !0 choke system is arranged in front of the gap, if the oven door
    is in the closed state.
    For example, the rear portion of the gasket has an L-shaped
    cross section. In this case, the L-shaped rear portion of the
25  gasket encloses at least partially a rim at the front side of
    the oven cavity.
    At last, the oven is a multifunctional oven with a microwave
    heating function and at least one further heating function.
30
    Novel and inventive features of the present invention are set
    forth in the appended claims.

      WO 20141114371                                   PCT/EP2013/072149
    The present invention will be described in further detail with
    reference to the drawings, in which
    FIG 1     illustrates a rear perspective view of an oven cavity and
 5           a front frame of a microwave oven or a multifunctional
             oven with microwave heating function according to a pre
              ferred embodiment of the present invention,
    FIG 2     illustrates a front view of the oven cavity and the front
 .0           frame of the microwave oven or the multifunctional oven
             with microwave heating function according to the pre
              ferred embodiment of the present invention,
    FIG 3     illustrates a sectional side view of the oven cavity and
 .5          the front frame of the microwave oven or the multifunc
             tional oven with microwave heating function according to
             the preferred embodiment of the present invention, and
    FIG 4     illustrates a detailed sectional side view of a gasket
 !0          between the oven cavity and the front frame of the micro
             wave oven or the multifunctional oven with microwave
             heating function according to the preferred embodiment of
             the present invention.
25  FIG 1 illustrates a rear perspective view of an oven cavity 10
    and a front frame 20 of a microwave oven or a multifunctional
    oven with microwave heating function according to a preferred
    embodiment of the present invention. The oven cavity 10 and the
    front frame 20 are made of sheet metal.
30
    The oven cavity 10 includes two side walls 12, a top wall 14, a
    bottom wall 18 and a rear wall 18. Thus, the oven cavity 10 is a
    casing with an open front side. The front frame 20 is attached
                                      5

       WO 20141114371                                PCT/EP2013/072149
    at the oven cavity 10 and encloses a front opening of said oven
    cavity 10.
    The front frame 20 is fixed at the oven cavity 10 by screws 24.
 5  In this example, the front frame 20 includes lugs 22, wherein
    the screws 24 penetrates said lugs 22 and corresponding lugs ar
    ranged on a flange surrounding the front open side of the oven
    cavity 10. Said flange is formed integrally to the oven cavity
    10 and is bent such, that the lugs arranged on said flange ex
 .0 tend parallel to the lugs 22. By means of this construction, the
    thermal flow from the oven cavity 10 into the front frame 20 is
    small.
    There is a gap 26 between the front frame 20 and the oven cavity
 5  10. The gap 26 encloses the oven cavity 10. In this example, the
    gap 26 has a width of about 2.5 mm. The gap 26 allows a thermal
    insulation between the oven cavity 10 and the front frame 20.
    There is no heat transfer from the oven cavity 10 to the front
    frame 20.
 !0
    The gap 26 is filled by a gasket 30. The gasket 30 is made of a
    thermal insulating material. The gasket 30 allows a sealing be
    tween the oven cavity 10 and the front frame 20 on the one hand
    and prevents the heat transfer from the oven cavity 10 to the
25  front frame 20 on the other hand. The only heat transferring
    elements are the screws 24. However, the number of screws be
    tween the front frame 20 and the oven cavity 10 is very low.
    Further, the gasket 30 comprises small metallic particles at
30  least in that part arranged within the gap 26 between the front
    frame 20 and the oven cavity 10. The metallic particles are very
    small and spaced from each other so far that the metallic parti
    cles do not form a thermal bridge between the cavity and front
    frame on the one hand. The equal distribution of the metallic
                                    6

       WO 20141114371                                PCT/EP2013/072149
    particles causes a similar function as a metal grid. Thus, the
    metallic particles prevent an infiltration of microwaves into
    the gap 26 between the front frame 20 and the oven cavity 10.
 5  FIG 2 illustrates a front view of the oven cavity 10 and the
    front frame 20 of the microwave oven or the multifunctional oven
    with microwave heating function according to the preferred em
    bodiment of the present invention. FIG 2 clarifies that the
    front frame 20 encloses the front opening of said oven cavity
 .0 10. Further, FIG 2 shows the gap 26 between the front frame 20
    and the oven cavity 10. The gap 26 encloses completely a front
    portion of the oven cavity 10.
    FIG 3 illustrates a sectional side view of the oven cavity 10
 .5 and the front frame 20 of the microwave oven or the multifunc
    tional oven with microwave heating function according to the
    preferred embodiment of the present invention.
    The front frame 20 encloses the front opening of the oven cavity
 !0 10. The gap 26 extends between the front frame 20 and the oven
    cavity 10. In other words, the gap 26 encloses the front portion
    of the oven cavity 10, while the front frame 20 encloses said
    gap 26 in turn.
25  An oven door 32 closes the front opening of the oven cavity 10.
    The front frame 20 encloses a rear portion of a circumferential
    surface of the oven door 32. Further, the front frame 20 en
    closes an outer portion of a rear side of the oven door 32.      The
    oven door 32 comprises a wave choke system 34 arranged inside
30  said oven door 32. The wave choke system 34 extends circumferen
    tially in an outer portion of the oven door 32. In a closed
    state of the oven door 32, the wave choke system 34 is arranged
    in front of the gap 26 and extends in parallel to said gap 26.

    The gap 26 is filled by the gasket 30. The gasket 30 is made of
    the thermal insulating material. The gasket 30 allows a sealing
    between the oven cavity 10 and the front frame 20 on the one
    hand and prevents the heat transfer from the oven cavity 10 to
 5  the front frame 20 on the other hand. In particular, the gasket
    30 is made of a silicone material.
    In this example, the gasket 30 includes two components 36 and 38
    made of different materials. The gasket 30 includes a front por
 .0 tion 36 and a rear portion 38. The front portion 36 of the gas
    ket 30 has substantially a triangular cross section and fills
    the gap 26 between the oven cavity 10 and the front frame 20.
    The rear portion 38 of the gasket 30 has an L-shaped cross sec
    tion enclosing partially a rim 42 at the front side of the oven
 .5 cavity 10. A rear side of the oven door 32 is aligned at a front
    side 44 of the front portion 36 of the gasket 30.   The front side
    44 of the front portion 36 works as a steam gasket. In particu
    lar, said front side 44 of the front portion 36 prevents the
    leakage of steam out of the oven cavity 10 between the oven door
 !0 32 and the front frame 20. Moreover, the front side 44 of the
    front portion 36 prevents the penetration of steam into the cas
    ing of the microwave oven between the oven cavity 10 and the
    front frame 20.
25  In this example, the front portion 36 of the gasket 30 comprises
    one or more electrically non-conductive materials, while the
    rear portion 38 of the gasket 30 comprises one or more electri
    cally conductive material. In general, the whole gasket 30 may
    be electrically conductive. At least a portion of the gasket 30
30  arranged within the gap 26 must be made of or comprises electri
    cally conductive material. It has been found that the front por
    tion 36 of the gasket 30 does not require an electrically con
    ductive component, if the wave choke system 34 is inside the
    oven door 32 and in front of the gap 26.

    The wave choke system 34 is already sufficient to stop leakage
    via the oven door 32.
 5  For example, the gasket 30 comprises different silicone materi
    als. The rear portion 38 of the gasket 30 may be made of one or
    more silicone materials containing small metallic particles
    mixed into said silicone materials.
 .0 The gasket 30 provides tightness for microwaves to the inner
    oven. Further, the gasket 30 provides tightness regarding steam
    and other substances occurring in the oven. Moreover, the gasket
    30 allows a compensation of tolerances of the oven door 32 and
    the front frame 20.
 .5
    FIG 4 illustrates a detailed sectional side view of the gasket
    30 between the oven cavity 10 and the front frame 20 of the mi
    crowave oven or the multifunctional oven with microwave heating
    function according to the preferred embodiment of the present
 !0 invention.
    The gasket 30 is made of the thermal insulating material and
    fills the gap 26. The gasket 30 allows the sealing between the
    oven cavity 10 and the front frame 20 and prevents the heat
25  transfer from the oven cavity 10 to the front frame 20. Addi
    tionally, the gasket 30 prevents the infiltration of microwaves
    into the casing of the microwave oven in order to avoid a dis
    ruption of electronic circuits inside said microwave oven.
30  The gasket 30 according to the preferred embodiment includes the
    front portion 36 and the rear portion 38. The front portion 36
    of the gasket 30 has substantially the triangular cross section
    and fills the front portion of the gap 26 between the oven cav
    ity 10 and the front frame 20. The rear portion 38 of the gasket
                                    9

      WO 20141114371                                    PCT/EP2013/072149
    30 has an L-shaped cross section and includes a hook 40 at its
    rear end. The hook 40 prevents that the gasket 30 slips out of
    the gap 26, if the gasket 30 adheres to the inner side of the
    oven door 32.    For example, the adhesion of the gasket 30 to the
 5  inner side of the oven door 32 may be caused by dirt on the gas
    ket 30 and/or the inner side of the oven door 32.     The rear por
    tion 38 of the gasket 30 encloses partially the rim 42 at the
    front side of the oven cavity 10. A rear side of the oven door
    32 is aligned at the front side 44 of the front portion 36 of
 .0 the gasket 30.
    The front portion 36 of the gasket 30 comprises one or more
    electrically non-conductive materials, while the rear portion 38
    of the gasket 30 comprises one or more electrically conductive
 .5 materials. In general, the whole gasket 30 may be electrically
    conductive. At least that portion of the gasket 30 arranged
    within the gap 26 is preferably made of or includes electrically
    conductive material. It has been found that the front portion 36
    of the gasket 30 does not require an electrically conductive
 !0 component, if the wave choke system 34 is inside the oven door
    32 and in front of the gap 26. The wave choke system 34 and the
    gap 26 between the oven cavity 10 and the front frame 20 shield
    substantially the whole microwave radiation, which could leak
    through the oven door 32 and/or between the front frame 20 and
25  the oven door 32. This effect may be supported, if the elastic
    part for gasket 30 arranged in this area includes electrically
    conductive material. The elastic part for gasket 30 allows a
    compensation of tolerance between the front frame 20 and the
    oven door 32.
30
    In general, the whole gasket 30 may be made of one or more elas
    tic materials. However, at least that portion of the gasket 30
    arranged between the front frame 20 and the inner side of the
    oven door 32 is preferably elastic. In contrast, that portion of
                                       10

     WO 20141114371                                    PCT/EP2013/072149
   the gasket 30 between the oven cavity 10 and the front frame 20
   may be alternatively made of one or more inflexible materials.
   For example, one or more rigid materials are pressed in between
   the oven cavity 10 and the front frame 20.
