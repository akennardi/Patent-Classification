FIELD
[0002]          The embodiments disclosed herein relate to a medical device for suturing tissue,
and more particularly to a device for the manipulation and control of a suturing needle during
minimally invasive suturing, methods for making such a device and methods for using such a
device for suturing tissue.
BACKGROUND
[0003]          Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has allowed physicians to carry out many
surgical procedures with less pain and disability than conventional, open surgery. Unlike
conventional open surgery, where the surgical site is readily accessible through a large incision,
enabling the surgeon to easily visualize and manipulate both tissue and instruments, MIS
requires the surgeon to operate remotely by inserting and manipulating instruments through

     WO 2012/044998                                                            PCT/US2011/054334
small punctures ("keyhole surgery") or through natural orifices, including for example the
vagina, the esophagus, or the anus.
[0004]          In MIS, a small puncture is typically made in the body. Medical instruments are
then inserted through a cannula. A cannula has a small inside diameter, typically 5-10
millimeters (mm), and sometimes up to 20 millimeters (mm) or more. A number of such
cannulas may be inserted into the body for any given operation. Minimally invasive surgical
instruments are necessarily smaller, and are also generally longer and therefore are more difficult
to manipulate with precision.
[0005]          Perhaps the most problematic surgical task in MIS is suturing. Suturing requires
coordinated manipulation with both hands of small needles and sutures that are difficult to
visualize (particularly when only indirect, two-dimensional video imaging is available) as well as
the several instruments (including needle-drivers and pick-up forceps) ordinarily used to suture
by hand. In an environment characterized by limited space, limited visualization, and limited
mobility, many surgeons find minimally invasive suturing by hand an extremely difficult, often
virtually impossible, surgical task.
[0006]          In the preferred method of suturing by hand, a grasping forceps ("needle driver")
is held by the surgeon and is used to grip a curved needle near the needle's tail. Pronation of the
surgeon's wrist drives the needle into the tissue. When the point of the curved needle emerges
from the tissue, the surgeon releases the needle from the grip of the needle driver and grasps the
point with another forceps ("pick-ups"). The surgeon then pulls the curved needle by the needle
point, preferably in a circular path following the arc of the needle's curvature to follow the most
atraumatic path through the tissue, until the entire length of the needle has exited the tissue.
Each time a stitch is placed, the curved needle is thus driven around in a complete circular arc.
Individual (interrupted) stitches are placed by tying off the suture following placement of each
stitch. Running (continuous) stitches are placed by repeatedly driving the curved needle in a
complete circular arc repeatedly until the desired length of suture and number of stitches has
been placed. In order to place additional interrupted or continuous stitches, the surgeon must let
                                                   2

go of the point of the needle and re-grasp the needle near the needle's tail.
[0007]           In the manual suturing technique described above, the direct handling of the
needle can result in accidental needle pricks through a surgeon or nurse's gloves, posing a
potential risk of infection for the surgeon, nurse, staff, and patient, or cause the needle to become
contaminated with pathogenic bacteria that can cause onset of infection at the site of the sutures.
There is also a risk of the needle penetrating internal organs or vessels and causing a serious, and
often fatal infection.

entitled "Methods and Apparatus for Suturing Tissue"; U.S. Pat. No. 5,665,096 entitled "Needle
Driving Apparatus and Methods of Suturing Tissue"; U.S. Pat. No. 5,665,109 entitled "Methods

suturing needle and needle rotation drive, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by
reference. The devices described in the above-mentioned patents and patent application
comprise a mechanism for driving a protected needle however, the needle is rotated about an axis
that is parallel to the axis of the device. In addition, the orientation and size of the suturing
device makes it difficult to visualize and cumbersome to use for MIS.
[00010]          Therefore, there remains a need in the art for a minimally invasive suturing device
that is easily manipulated within the small diameter of the cannula; functions in an environment
characterized by limited space, limited visualization, and limited mobility; mimics the preferred
method of suturing used by surgeons; permits the surgeon to secure and tie knots quickly and

                                            SUMMARY
[00011]         Devices and methods for minimally invasive suturing of tissue internal to a body
are disclosed herein.
[00012]         According to aspects illustrated herein, there is provided a medical device for
closing openings internal to a patient's body, which closely emulates or replicates the manual
suturing actions carried out by a surgeon. The device offers several advantages over
conventional methods used by surgeons for suturing tissue during minimally invasive surgery in
that the device provides a hand-held suturing instrument that requires no external motive source.
The presently disclosed embodiments provide relative ease of operation for the surgeon with
only one hand.
[00013]         According to aspects illustrated herein, a suture head assembly may be removably
attached to an actuator mechanism of the suturing device. The diameter of the device is small
enough to fit into a 5mm cannula in some embodiments, thus making the device extremely easy
to maneuver, as well as suture, during endoscopic or other MIS procedures. In surgical
procedures, it is desirable to make as few incisions as possible, and for those incisions to be as
small as possible. As such, devices with reduced profile are highly advantageous. Also, the
suture head assembly of the device can be laterally articulated to the left of center, to the right of
center, up, and down, once inside the cannula, which is ideal for use in the course of endoscopic
surgery, including laparoscopy, thoracoscopy and arthroscopy, as well as other less-invasive
surgical procedures.
                                                  4

    WO 2012/044998                                                             PCT/US2011/054334
[00014]          Devices of the present disclosed embodiments closely emulate or replicate the
manual suturing actions carried out by a surgeon. For example, during manual suturing by hand,
the needle is held in forceps and travels in a circular arc with no obstructions anywhere in the
interior of the arc. The design of the suturing devices of the present disclosed embodiments
allows for a lack of obstruction in the center of the arc of the needle during suturing. In other
words, there is no hub at the center of the circular arc of the suturing needle. The entire area
within the circular arc of the needle is unobstructed. This allows for the user to have better
visualization during operation, unlike the present mechanical suturing methods, while
maintaining control over needle movement.
[00015]          A benefit provided by suturing devices of the presently disclosed embodiments is
that the devices enable maneuvering a suturing material through a tissue incision in a manner
substantially similar to the way a surgeon would do so by hand. In particular, some
embodiments of the suturing device first push a suturing needle from the tail of the needle and
drives the point of the needle through the tissue. The device then picks up the point of the needle
that passed through the tissue, and pulls the remainder of the suturing needle and the suture
attached to the suturing needle through the tissue. The suturing needle thus consistently follows
the arc of the needle's own curve, which is the preferred method of suturing, in the most
atraumatic way of passing a needle through tissue. A benefit provided by the suturing device of
the presently disclosed embodiments is the ability of the suturing needle to pull the suturing
thread entirely through the tissue segments being closed, following each stitch. When using the
suturing device of the presently disclosed embodiments, no ancillary instruments or tools such as
needle holders, pick-up forceps or the like are needed to complete the stitch. A forceps or
grasping instrument can be used to tighten the knots.
[00016]          According to aspects illustrated herein, there is provided an embodiment of a
suturing device that includes a suturing needle that is protected by a housing, the suturing needle
is not exposed to or handled directly by the user, thereby preventing inadvertent needle sticks.
The configuration of the suturing device of the presently disclosed embodiments also protects
against inadvertent penetration of internal organs or vessels by the needle, since the housing acts

    WO 2012/044998                                                              PCT/US2011/054334
as a shield between the organs and the needle.
[00017]         In one embodiment, a suturing device is provided having a suturing head. The
suturing head includes a housing defining at least one passage therein and a deployable needle
track. The deployable needle track is disposed in the housing, and the needle track is adapted
and configured to be deployed, or expanded from a stored or contracted condition wherein the
needle track is essentially disposed within the housing to an expanded, or deployed condition
wherein the needle track extends outwardly from the housing to form an arcuate needle track.
The device further includes an arcuate or circular needle disposed in the deployable needle track,
the needle having a first end, a second end, and a generally toroidal body. The device further
includes a drive for advancing the needle about a 3600 path about the needle track when the
deployable needle track is in a deployed condition. The drive is adapted and configured to
advance the needle in multiple 3600 revolutions about the needle track when the deployable or
expandable needle track is in a deployed or expanded condition without removing the needle
from the needle track. The drive selectively engages with and disengages from the needle to
advance the needle about a 3600 rotation.
[00018]         In accordance with further aspects, the housing of the suturing device can be
generally cylindrical, and have an outer diameter of about 5.0 mm. The circular path of the
needle track can have a diameter of about 10 mm. If desired, the needle can have a non-circular
cross-section. Preferably, the device further includes means for deploying the needle track from
the stored condition to the deployed condition. The needle track can occupy about 2700 of the
3600 needle path when the needle track is deployed. It will be appreciated however that the
present disclosure is directed to a device having a deployable, or, angularly expandable, needle
track that can expand to a final extent that is greater or less than 2700, such as in increments of
one degree. For example, a needle track can be provided that expands from about 1800 to about
1900, about 2000, about 2100, about 2200, about 2300, about 2400, about 2500, about 2600, about
2700, about 2800, about 2900, about 3000, about 3100, about 3200, or about 300', among others.
For example, depending on the diameter of the device and the dimensions of the needle track, it
may only be necessary to have guides that increase the angular extent of the needle track by
about 100, about 200, about 300, about 400, about 500, about 600, about 700, about 800, about
                                                   6

     WO 2012/044998                                                           PCT/US2011/054334
900, about 1000, about 1100, about 1200, about 1300, about 1400, about 1500, or about 1600 from
the undeployed (unexpanded) configuration to the deployed (expanded) configuration. The drive
can include an elongate flexible member that reciprocates along a longitudinal axis of the device.
The drive can engage with and advance the needle along the needle track when the elongate
flexible member is advanced proximally with respect to the housing. The needle can include
first and second notches along an inner face of the needle for engaging an antirotate mechanism
disposed on at least one of the housing and the deployable needle track. The needle can further
include a notch on a top face of the needle for engaging a portion of the drive, wherein the notch
on the top face of the needle intersects one of the notches disposed on the inner face of the
needle.
[00019]          In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the deployable needle track includes
at least one arcuate guide that is adapted to be deployed from the housing along an arcuate path.
Preferably, the deployable needle track includes a pair of arcuate guides that are adapted to be
deployed from the housing along an arcuate path. The pair of arcuate guides are preferably
deployed from the housing along the arcuate path by pulling in a first pair of pull wires, wherein
one pull wire is attached to each guide. The pair of guides are further preferably adapted and
configured to be retracted into the housing by pulling in a second pair of pull wires, wherein one
pull wire in the second pair of pull wires is attached to each guide. The first pair of pull wires is
preferably connected to the second pair of pull wires to make a pair of continuous mechanical
loops, wherein the loops are connected at a distal end to the guides, and at a proximal end to a
pair of handles, wherein movement of the handles results in movement of the guides.
[00020]          The disclosure also provides a suturing needle having an arcuate body with a
leading tip and a trailing end, wherein the arcuate body defines a first notch along an inner radial
region needle and a second notch having a projection that lies within a plane that is defined by a
central curved axis of the needle, and further wherein the first notch and second notch intersect.
If desired, the needle can further includes a generally square cross-section. The needle body can
include a portion with a round cross section that separates a main portion of the needle with a
generally square cross section from a tail portion with a generally square cross section. The
needle can further define a third notch in the needle proximate its trailing end for receiving a
                                                   7

    WO 2012/044998                                                                PCT/US2011/054334
portion of a drive pawl. Moreover, the needle can define an arcuate keel along its length to
stabilize its movement in the suturing device.
[00021]          According to aspects illustrated herein, there is provided a method for suturing
tissue during minimally invasive surgery that includes inserting a distal end of a suturing device
having a suturing needle with a pointed end into a body; positioning the suturing needle to span a
plurality of separated tissue segments; activating an actuator a first time causing the pointed end
of the suturing needle to extend beyond a protective housing of a cartridge to engage the plurality
of separated tissue segments; and activating the actuator a second time to cause the suturing
needle to complete a revolution and pull a suture extending from the suturing needle through the
plurality of separated tissue segments to form a stitch.
[00022]          In accordance with a further aspect, a suturing device having a suturing head is
provided. The suturing head includes a housing defining at least one passage therein, the
housing having a proximal end, a distal end and a peripheral side joining the proximal and distal
ends. The head further includes a deployable needle track disposed at least partially within the
housing, the needle track being adapted and configured to be deployed from a stored condition
wherein the needle track is essentially disposed within the housing and has an angular extent of
about 1800 to a deployed condition wherein the needle track has an angular extent in excess of
180' and extends outwardly from the peripheral side of the housing to form an arcuate needle
track that lies in a plane that is parallel to a longitudinal axis of the housing. Preferably, the
needle track is angularly expandable along a circular path that defines the path of travel of the
needle such that the track expands angularly about the circular path from a contracted condition
to an expanded condition. The suturing head further includes an arcuate needle disposed in the
deployable needle track, the needle having a first end, a second end, and a generally toroidal
body. The suturing head further includes a drive for advancing the needle in multiple 3600
revolutions about the needle track when the deployable needle track is in a deployed condition,
wherein the drive selectively engages with and disengages from the needle to advance the needle
about a 360 rotation.
[00023]          In accordance with a further aspect, housing is generally cylindrical, and has a
diameter of about 5.0 mm and the path of the needle track has a diameter of about 10 mm.

    WO 2012/044998                                                              PCT/US2011/054334
However, it will be appreciated that the diameter can be larger or smaller as desired. The needle
can have a substantially circular cross section, a circular cross section, a non-circular cross
section, a square or triangular cross section, or may have a cross section that varies along its
length that transitions from one shape to another, such as from a square to a circle to a square.
The device preferably further includes means for deploying the needle track from the stored
condition to the deployed condition. The needle track preferably occupies about 270' of a 3600
needle path when the needle track is deployed, but the angular extent of the track can be more or
less than 2700, as desired, in one degree increments, for example.
[00024]         In accordance with a further aspect, the drive preferably includes an elongate
flexible member that reciprocates along a longitudinal axis of the device. The drive preferably
engages with and advances the needle along the needle track when the elongate flexible member
is advanced proximally with respect to the housing. The deployable needle track preferably
includes at least one arcuate guide that is adapted to be deployed from the housing along an
arcuate path. The deployable needle track preferably includes a pair of arcuate guides that are
adapted to be deployed from the housing along an arcuate path. The pair of arcuate guides are
preferably deployed from the housing along the arcuate path by pulling in a first pair of pull
wires, wherein one pull wire is attached to each guide. The pair of arcuate guides is preferably
adapted and configured to be retracted into the housing by pulling in a second pair of pull wires,
wherein one pull wire in the second pair of pull wires is attached to each guide. The first pair of
pull wires is preferably connected to the second pair of pull wires to make a pair of continuous
mechanical loops, wherein the loops are connected at a distal end to the guides, and at a proximal
end to a pair of handles, wherein movement of the handles results in movement of the guides.
[00025]         In another embodiment, a suturing device is provided having a suturing head.
The suturing head includes an elongate housing having a proximal end, a distal end and a
peripheral side joining the proximal and distal ends, wherein the housing defines a longitudinal
axis from its proximal end to its distal end. The suturing head further includes a deployable
needle track disposed at least partially within the housing, at least a portion of the needle track
being adapted and configured to be deployed along an arcuate path from a undeployed condition
wherein the needle track has an arcuate extent of about 180 degrees and is essentially disposed
within the housing to a deployed condition wherein the needle track has an arcuate extent in
excess of 180 degrees, and wherein the needle track lies in a plane that is parallel to a

longitudinal axis of the housing. The suturing head further includes an arcuate needle disposed
in the deployable needle track, the needle having a first end, a second end, and a generally
toroidal body. The suturing head also includes a drive for advancing the needle in multiple 3600
revolutions about the needle track when the deployable needle track is in a deployed condition,
wherein the drive selectively engages with and disengages from the needle to advance the needle
about a 360' rotation.
[00026]          In accordance with a further aspect, the housing can be generally cylindrical or
rectilinear, as desired. The deployable or expandable needle track can include one or more
arcuate guides that are adapted to be deployed from the housing along an arcuate path. The
deployable or expandable needle track can include a pair of arcuate guides that are adapted to be
deployed from the housing along an arcuate path. Accordingly, a pair of arcuate guides can be
deployed from the housing along the arcuate path by pulling on a first pair of pull wires, wherein
one pull wire is attached to each guide. In one embodiment, the deployable or expandable needle
track occupies about 2700 of a 3600 needle path when the needle track is in the expanded
condition, but the angular extent of the track can be more or less than 270', as desired, in one
degree increments, for example.

[00036]          While the drawings set forth presently disclosed embodiments, other
embodiments are also contemplated, as noted in the discussion. This disclosure presents
illustrative embodiments by way of representation and not limitation. Numerous other
modifications and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art which fall within the

                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[00037]          Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiments of the
disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The method and
corresponding steps of the disclosed embodiments will be described in conjunction with the
detailed description of the system.

    WO 2012/044998                                                             PCT/US2011/054334
[00038]         Broadly speaking, the disclosure provides embodiments of suturing devices
having features that permit the device to be constructed on a smaller scale and having a smaller
profile than embodiments discussed in the prior art and in patent applications incorporated herein
by reference. In particular, embodiments made in accordance with the present disclosure have
been constructed that are adapted and configured to fit through a 5mm trocar. Advantageously,
the disclosed embodiments still use a comparatively large suturing needle, thereby permitting
substantial tissue capture during operation, resulting in effective suturing.
[00039]         For purposes of illustration and not limitation, as embodied herein, an exemplary
embodiment of a suturing device 1000 is illustrated in Fig. 1. Device 1000 includes three
regions, including a suture head 100, an intermediate region 500, and a handle 600. Each of
these regions is discussed in detail below. Figs. 2-3 illustrate device 1000 with certain portions
removed. In particular, Fig. 2 illustrates device 1000 with a needle loader removed (discussed in
further detail below), while Fig. 3 illustrates device 1000 with certain portions of the handle
housing removed.
[00040]         For purposes of illustration, and not limitation, suture head 100, separated from
the remainder of device 1000, is illustrated in Fig. 4. Suture head 100 includes a proximal end
102, a distal end 104, and is formed by the cooperation of three main housing components (106,
108, 112) that define a gap 110 for receiving tissue of a patient to be sutured together. Suture
head 100 is adapted and configured to direct a semi-circular needle (300, 350, 400) about a
semicircular track and across gap 110 to form a series of sutures through tissue to be sutured.
[00041]         Prior to advancing needle across gap 110, suture head 100 must be converted
from a delivery configuration to a deployed configuration. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5,
suture head 100 is initially provided in a compact form having a predetermined transverse
dimension, or diameter, p. This transverse dimension, p, can be any desired dimension, and is
preferably about 5 millimeters. In particular, the dimension p is preferably selected so that
suture head 100 can pass through a standard 5mm trocar into a patient's abdomen, for example,
during a laparoscopic surgical procedure. Fig. 5 shows suture head 100 from the opposite angle
                                                   12

    WO 2012/044998                                                               PCT/US2011/054334
as compared to Fig. 4, including pivot boss 114, which mates with intermediate portion 500 of
device 1000.
[00042]          Suture head 100 is illustrated in deployed configuration in Fig. 6. As illustrated in
Fig. 6, in a deployed configuration, proximal guide 120 and distal guide 130 are moved
outwardly from their nested position defined by housing components 106, 108, discussed in
further detail below. When deployed as in Fig. 6, guides 120, 130 define a circular needle path
or track 140 that lies in a plane P that is parallel to a longitudinal axis X of device 1000. In
addition, as illustrated, leading tip 302 of needle 300 is advanced slightly by virtue of being
dragged along by virtue of a pawl 125 in proximal guide 120 engaging a notch 306 disposed
along an interior surface of needle 300, discussed in detail below.
[00043]          After guides 120, 130 are in a deployed condition and needle track 140 is defined,
needle 300 can then be advanced through track by advancing pawl 160 to a distal extremity
along its path of reciprocation. Fig. 7 illustrates needle 300 spanning the gap 110, wherein
needle 300, being about 180' in arcuate extent, is essentially located outside of the enclosure
defined by housing segments 106, 108, 112.
[00044]          Figs. 8-10 illustrate the functionality of suture head 110 from the opposite side of
the head. Fig. 8 illustrates suture head 100 in a delivery configuration with the guides 120, 130
retracted. As can be seen, engagement pawl 160 is withdrawn to a position proximal to the
needle 300, and the trailing end 304 of needle 300 is visible. Fig. 9 illustrates suture head in a
deployed configuration wherein guides 120, 130 are deployed. As seen in Fig. 9, distal guide
130 defines an arcuate recess 135 that receives the pawl 160 at the distal extremity of its
reciprocating movement, best observed in Fig. 10. As is evident from Fig. 10, notch 158 in drive
member 150 is advanced in a distal direction as is pawl 160.
[00045]          Figs. 11(A)-11(D) illustrate the structure of the engagement pawl 160. Pawl 160
includes a housing 166 attached (e.g., welded) to the distal end 154 of drive member 150.
Housing 166 is preferably a metallic tubular structure, and houses a pawl spring 164 biased
                                                     13

between a movable pin 168 and cap portion 162. Cap 162 is preferably attached to housing 166,
such as be welding.
[00046]         Fig. 12 illustrates suture head 100 with cover portion 106 removed, revealing the
reciprocating guide path followed by drive member 150 and pawl 160, as well as guides 120,
130. Guides 120, 130 are advanced from the delivery configuration to the deployed
configuration by four advancement wires, cables or filaments, 172, 174, 176, 178 that are
directed around a series of bosses in housing portion 106, discussed below. In particular, each
guide 120, 130 includes crimps 102a, 120b, 130a, 130b that integrally form a end of each of the
guides 120, 130. Each crimp includes passages formed therein for receiving an end of wires
172-178. Wires 172-178 can take any suitable form, most preferably multi-strand 300 series
Stainless Steel cables .009" in diameter. These ends are then crimped, adhered or otherwise
attached to the crimps. Then by applying tension to one wire in each pair attached to each guide,
the guides 120, 130 are pulled into or out of the suture head 100.
[00047]         Fig. 13 illustrates the guides 120, 130 in a deployed condition and does not
display wires 172-178 simply for purposes of clarity. Fig. 14 illustrates drive member 150 with
pawl 160 at the full distal extent of its travel, riding within groove 135 in the side of guide 130.
The elevation 130e of wall 130d can be increased and can be thickened to coincide with groove
135 to provide an enhanced bearing surface for pawl 160. Stops (not shown) are preferably
provided in the form of raised surfaces on guides 120, 130 and the housing components to help
prevent guides 120, 130 from falling out of suture head.
[00048]         As is also evident, groove 125 in the side of guide 120 becomes accessible for the
passage of pawl when the guides are in a deployed condition. As illustrated in Fig. 14, guide 150
traverses an arcuate path along guides and follows the path of the needle. Fig. 15 illustrates the
spatial relationship of drive member 150 with respect to needle with other device components
removed. Fig. 16 illustrates the relative positions of needle 300 with respect to antirotate springs
115 and drive pin 168 housed within pawl 160. Fig. 17 illustrates drive pin 168 in detail,
wherein pin 168 includes a distal face 168a that contacts a body of the needle, a circumferential
generally cylindrical face 168b, the distal extremity of which also contacts a surface of a notch in
                                                     14

    WO 2012/044998                                                            PCT/US2011/054334
needle 100, or the distal end 304 of needle, a proximal face 168d that contacts pawl spring 164,
an enlarged head portion 168c, and a circumferential distal face 168e that contacts with a
narrowed portion of the housing 166 of pawl 160 that prevents pin 168 from falling out of
housing 166.
[00049]         Figs. 18-21 are additional views of suture head 100 showing a progressive
removal of components. Fig. 18 shows the suture head 100 in tact, while Figs. 19-20 shows the
positioning of bosses 106a, 106b, 106c on housing portion 106 that define bearing points for
guide cables 172, 174, 176, 178 (not shown). Spacers 106d may also be provided to maintain a
desired distance between housing components 106, 108 to permit the movement of components
within suture head 100, and can also act as bearing surfaces for wires 176, 178 (Fig. 29). Figs.
20-21 illustrate removal of guard 109 which provides inner support for guides 120, 130 to bear
against. Guides 120, 130 ride in arcuate channels defined by the cooperation of components 106,
108 and 109.
[00050]         Fig. 22 illustrates proximal and distal guides 120, 130 in the same spatial
relationship as in Fig. 21. Views of the proximal guide 120 are depicted in Figs. 23(A)-23(B).
Guides 120, 130 are preferably made from a metallic material by assembling a series of metallic
subcomponents, such as by laser welding, and are unitary and integral once assembled. Guides
can be thought of as having a "top" face that faces the drive member 150, and a bottom "face"
that faces housing portion 108. Proximal guide 120 defines a curved channel 125 in the top face
122 thereof. Proximal guide 120 further defines a lower face 124, having a groove 124b defined
therein, an inner face 126 that bears against the inner surface of guard 109 and an outer face 128
that bears against housing components 106, 108. As illustrated in Figs. 24(A)-24(B), distal guide
130 defines a curved channel 135 in the top face 132 thereof for guiding the pawl 160. Distal
guide 130 further defines a lower face 134, having a groove 134b defined therein, an inner face
136 that bears against the inner surface of guard 109 and an outer face 138 that bears against
housing components 106, 108.
[00051]         Figs. 25-32 illustrate the cooperation between wires/filaments 172-178 and guides
120, 130. As shown in these figures, wires/filaments 172, 174, 176 and 178 cooperate with
                                                  15

    WO 2012/044998                                                            PCT/US2011/054334
bosses 106a, 106b, 106c and the other components of suture head 100 to permit guides 120, 130
to be selectively advanced and retracted. Wire 178 terminates in crimp 130b of guide 130.
Applying tension to wire 178, which wraps around boss 106a (Fig. 28) results in guide 120 being
advanced out of the suture head 100. Conversely, applying tension to wire 176, which
terminates in crimp 130a of guide 130 (Fig. 30) causes guide 130 to be retracted into suture head
100. Similarly, applying tension to wire 172, which wraps around boss 106c and is attached to
guide 120 at crimp 120b, causes guide 120 to be advanced out of suture head, while applying
tension to wire 174, which wraps around boss 106c in a direction opposite to wire 172, pulls at
the attachment point at crimp 120a, causing the guide 120 to be withdrawn back into the housing.
[00052]         Figs. 33- 37 illustrate an embodiment of a needle loader 180 that is configured for
loading a suturing needle (300, 350, 400) into suture head 100. Needle loader 180 has two main
components, including a main body portion 182 and an advancement portion 184. Pin 184a of
advancement portion is received in opening 182a of main body portion 182. Main body portion
182 defines a groove 182f for receiving a suturing needle (300, 350, 400). Main body portion
182 includes a central portion 182 d and clip portions 182c, 182e that fit over suture head 100. If
desired, clip portions 182c, 182e may be adapted to snap fit over suture head 100. A distal stop
plate 182b is provided to facilitate axial alignment between loader 180 and suture head 100.
Advancement portion 184 rotates within opening 182a of main body portion 182, and further
includes a needle pushing arm 186. In operation, a needle is situated within track 184f with
suturing material attached to the trailing end, as discussed herein. The loader 180 is then
snapped onto suture head. Arm 186 is preferably situated at this time proximate the trailing end
of the needle. Arm 186 is then rotated such that needle (300, 350, 400) is advanced into the
needle track 140. If needed, needle (300, 350, 400) can be advanced back into the needle loader
180, by virtue of the fact that arm 186 is dimensioned to pass through the grooves 124b, 134b of
proximal guide 120 and distal guide 130, respectively.
[00053]         Figs. 38-40 illustrate a first embodiment of a suturing needle 300. Needle 300
includes an arcuate body defined by a leading end 302, a trailing end 304 and a generally toroidal
surface 305. Needle 300 includes a plurality of notches 306, 308, 310 formed therein, as well as
an opening 312 in trailing end 304 for receiving an end of a length of suturing material 312a.

Notches 306, 308 are located on an inner radial region 322 of needle, while notch 310 has a
projection that lies within a plane P' that is defined by the central curved axis X' of the needle.
Notch 310 includes a first portion 310a that is generally perpendicular to the plane P' and a
portion 310b that generally lies in plane P', and a sloped portion 310c. The notches 306, 308
have projections that are generally perpendicular to the plane P'. Notches 308, 306 have first
portions 306a, 308a that are generally parallel to a cross section of the needle in that location,
and sloped portions 306b, 308b that are angled (such as by an angle of 60 degrees) with respect
to portions 306a, 308a. Notches 308, 310 intersect to facilitate the function of the particular
embodiments of suturing head 100, 100' described herein.
[00054]          Figs. 41-44 illustrate a second embodiment of a suturing needle 350. Needle 350
includes an arcuate body defined by a leading end 352, a trailing end 354 and a generally toroidal
surface 355. Needle 350 includes a plurality of notches 356, 358, 360 formed therein, as well as
an opening 362 in trailing end 354 for receiving an end of a length of suturing material. Notches
356, 358 are located on an inner radial region 372 of needle, while notch 360 has a projection
that lies within a plane P' that is defined by the central curved axis X' of the needle. Notch 360
includes a first portion 360a that is generally perpendicular to the plane P' and a portion 360b
that generally lies in plane P', and a sloped portion 360c. The notches 356, 358 have projections
that are generally perpendicular to the plane P'. Notches 358, 356 have first portions 356a, 358a
that are generally parallel to a cross section of the needle in that location, and sloped portions
356b, 358b that are angled (such as by an angle of 60 degrees) with respect to portions 356a,
358a. Notches 358, 360 intersect to facilitate the function of the particular embodiments of
suturing head 100, 100' described herein. Needle 350 further includes a generally square cross
section having a rounded portion 366 and a tail portion 364, also having a round cross section.
Stated another way, the needle body includes a portion with a round cross section 366 that
separates a main portion of the needle with a generally square cross section from a tail portion
364 with a generally square cross section. It is believed that using a needle with a square cross
section helps the needle 350 cross the gap 110 of suture head and re-enter suture head with
superior alignment as compared to needle 300.

[00055]         Fig. 45 illustrates a third embodiment of a suturing needle 400. Needle 400
includes an arcuate body defined by a leading end 402, a trailing end 404 and a generally toroidal
surface 405. Needle 400 includes a plurality of notches 406, 408, 410 formed therein, as well as
an opening 412 in trailing end 404 for receiving an end of a length of suturing material. Notches
406, 408 are located on an inner radial region 422 of needle, while notch 410 has a projection
that lies within a plane P' that is defined by the central curved axis X' of the needle. The notches
406, 408, 410 are generally similar to those described with respect to needle 300. The principal
difference between needles 300, 400 are the addition of an additional notch 415 cut into the
needle proximate its trailing end 404. Notch 415 has a projection in the plane P' and is shaped to
receive the housing 166 of the pawl 160. It is believed that using a needle with notch 415 helps
the needle 400 cross the gap 110 of suture head and re-enter suture head with superior alignment
as compared to needle 300.
[00056]         Fig. 46 illustrates a fourth embodiment of a suturing needle 450. Needle 450 is
essentially the same as needle 300, except that it further includes an arcuate keel 475, or raised
surface, along its length. Keel 475 is adapted and configured to ride in grooves 124b, 134b of
guides 120, 130 to stabilize the needle 450 as it crosses the gap 110 of suture head and re-enters
suture head with superior alignment as compared to needle 300.
[00057]         Figs. 47(F)-55 illustrate aspects of an alternative embodiment of a suture head
100' made in accordance with the disclosure. The principal difference between suture head 100
and suture head 100' lies in the path of travel of the drive element 150.
[00058]         Embodiment 100 of suture head includes a drive member 150 that defines a
narrowed, or notched region 158, as illustrated in Fig. 12, for example. In operation, notched
region 158 is located to coincide with bosses 106W, 108W (Figs. 47(A)-47(D)) when pawl 160
is located at the distal extremity of its range of motion within groove 135 of distal guide 130.
When in this position, drive member 150 extends into groove 125 of proximal guide 120 (Fig.
14). However, as soon as tension is then applied to bring pawl 160 (and needle 300) proximally
along the needle track, the narrowed region 158 of drive member 150 slips past bosses 106W,
108W, so that pawl 160 will travel up lower leg of passage 106T when moving proximally until
                                                   18

    WO 2012/044998                                                            PCT/US2011/054334
it passes boss 106W and emerges from the passage, ready to begin another cycle. Stated another
way, bosses 106W, 108W result in a passageway between them that permits narrowed region
158 to slip through, but not the rest of member 150 or pawl 160. Thus, narrowed region 158
permits the drive member 150 to travel along an upper path above bosses 106W, 108W when
advancing distally, and slip past bosses 106W, 108W when region 158 aligns with the bosses,
thus permitting drive member 150 and pawl 160 to move proximally along a lower path below
bosses 106W, 108W. Housing portion 112 is illustrated in Fig. 47(E).
Accordingly, it can be appreciated that drive member 150 should ideally be metallic. Preferably,
member 150 is made from hardened stainless steel that has been heat treated to HR 900, and may
have a chromium coating, such as an Armoloy ME 92@ coating commercially available from
ME-92@ West/Armoloy@ of Illinois, 118 Simonds Avenue, DeKalb, IL 60115, (815) 758-6691.
Preferably, member 150 is 17-7 PH Stainless steel, condition "C" that is then hardened to
condition CH900, and then coated with a ME 92@ coating. Preferably, the ME-92@ coating is
applied after 900 Heat Treatment. The sequence of operations in manufacturing member 150
includes providing 17-7 PH strip stock material that is machined to size by any number of known
methods (e.g., electrical discharge machining ("EDM"), shearing, milling, etc.). The drive
ribbon is heat treated, and then cleaned to remove heat treatment surface oxidation, and the ME
92 @coating is then applied. By way of further example, 17-7PH condition "A" material can be
heat treated to RH950. In other embodiments, the drive member 150 can be made, for example,
from shape memory material such as nickel-titanium alloys sold under the trade name of
NITINOL@ and the like. In another embodiment, member 150 is made from a polymeric
material. In one aspect, member 150 can include polyethylene terephthalate material or nylon
material of high strength. If desired, a laminate of plastic and metal materials or multiple
materials can be used. By way of further example, member 150 can be comprised of a bundle of
wires or filaments, a single wire or filament, or any material in any configuration that permits
driving the needle around the needle track.
[00059]         The other components of suture head 100 including the needle (300, etc.) are
preferably formed by metal injection molding ("MIM") techniques, as are known in the art from
various materials, preferably stainless steel. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, 17-4

PH stainless steel alloy is preferably used. Device 1000 is preferably a disposable device, and
handle components are preferably made from injection molded plastic wherever desirable.
[00060]          A further embodiment of a suture head 100' is set forth in Figs. 47(F)-55. The
principal difference between suture head 100' and suture head 100 is that the drive member 150
in suture head 100' follows a single path during reciprocation, in contrast with the alternating
path of embodiment 100. Fig. 47(F) illustrates suture head 100' including a needle 300 with
guides 120', 130' in a deployed configuration. Guides 120' 130' are only partially represented
and are not depicted including crimps at their extremities for mating with deployment or
retraction cables as with embodiment 100 discussed earlier. Suture head 100' defines a guide
path 153' between housing components 106', 112' (Fig. 48), similar to the manner in which
suture head 100 defines a guide path between housing components 106 and 112 (Fig. 21). Fig.
48 further illustrates an alternate path 1001 that can be traversed by drive member 150' by
modifying components 106', 112' by removing material 112a' that acts as a pawl stop and
adding material 106'b in component 106' to act as a new pawl stop. The end result is a different
angle of incidence for the drive member 150.
[00061]          Fig. 49 illustrates the "left" housing component 108' from various angles, while
Figs. 50(A)-50(E) illustrate the "right" housing component from various angles. Apparent from
the figures is the path 153' followed by the drive member 150' and pawl 160' (not shown). It
will be appreciated that drive member 150' and pawl 160' can be substantially identical to
embodiments 150, 160, but need not have the notched region 158, as a single path for traversal of
pawl 160' is defined by cooperation of housing components 106', 108'. Guard 109' is illustrated
in Figs 51(A)-51(B), and illustrates the location of pawl 115' that helps prevent needle (e.g.,
300) from moving against the direction of desired travel. Fig. 52 illustrates the spatial
relationship of guides 120', 130' with respect to pin face 168a' and pawl 160' in their two
respective locations, for purposes of illustration only. Figs. 53(A)-53(D) illustrate various views
of housing portion 112'. Figs 54-55 illustrate the spatial orientation of guides 120', 130' (which
are substantially identical to guides 120, 130) with respect to pawl 115' and further illustrates
guide stops 117', which help guides 120', 130' stop in a predetermined location when in an
undeployed condition.

[00062]          Figs. 56-59 illustrate aspects of the intermediate region 500 of device 1000.
Intermediate region 500 includes an elongate, preferably metallic tube 510 having a proximal
end and a distal end 514. Distal end 514 of tube 510 is attached to a knuckle assembly 520,
which in turn is pivotally attached at pivot 114 to suture head 110. A pulley 515 is located at
pivot 114 to serve as a bearing surface for adjoined articulation cables 532, 534 and cables 532,
534 are preferably affixed to pulley 515 to provide leverage for accomplishing articulation.
Articulation cables 532, 534 can take any suitable form, most preferably multi-strand 300 series
Stainless Steel cables that are .020" in diameter. By pulling on one of the articulation cables, the
suture head 100 will articulate with respect to intermediate region 500 about the pivot 114.
Knuckle 520 includes a proximal end 522 and a distal end 524 (in the form of a yoke 524a, 524b
for receiving suture head 100) separated by an intermediate region 526. Intermediate region 526
defines a longitudinal channel 528 therethrough for receiving drive member 150. Preferably,
member 150 is attached to a pull rod 151 in this region, and the cross-sectional profile of channel
528 is adapted to accommodate such a geometry, as depicted in the Figures. Openings 523 are
also defined for receiving members 532, 534. Moreover, openings 525, 527 are also provided to
permit passage of pull wires/cables 172, 174, 176, 178 for controlling the movement of guides
120, 130. The proximal end of tubular member 510 is attached to a roticulation mechanism that
rotates the tube 510 and suture head 100 with respect to a handle 600 of the device, discussed
below. The distal end 514a of tube 510 may be extended slightly to provide for tighter control of
drive element 150 as it passes into intermediate region 500.
[00063]          For purposes of illustration, and not limitation, handle 600 of device 1000 is
illustrated from Figs. 60-122. Handle 600 includes many components and systems for operating
suture head 100, 100'. Fig. 61 illustrates a head-on view of handle with tube 510 removed,
illustrating roticulation handle 620, wherein relative rotational motion of handle 620 with respect
to handle 600 will cause the suture head 100, 100' to rotate with respect to handle 600. Fig. 60
depicts a rear view of handle 600. Fig. 62 depicts handle with roticulation handle 620 removed,
and depicting proximal cable guide 606, left tube collar 634 and right tube collar 632. Tube
collar portions 632, 634 cooperate to capture the proximal end 512 of tube 510, which can be, for
example and not limitation, a 5mm nominal outside diameter stainless steel hypotube. Also

illustrated is articulation handle 630 that can be used to articulate suture head 100 about its pivot
point as discussed above. Housing 600 includes two main housing halves including a right side
612 and a left side 614. Fig. 63 illustrates handle 600 with tube collars 632, 634 removed.
Proximal cable guide 606 is anchored within hypotube, such as by interference fit. The
longitudinal distance along tube 510 between the distal disc 606b of proximal cable guide 606
and cable disc 648 (Figs. 71-72) represents a twist region over which all cables routed through
tube 510 can rotate and twist about each other when the suture head is roticulated, or rotated with
respect to the handle 600. The twist region is preferably between about three and six inches
long, most preferably about four inches long. In a preferred embodiment, suture head has a total
angular range of motion of about 270 degrees with respect to handle 600, desirably about 135
degrees in either direction from the home position illustrated in the Figures. Detents in
roticulation handle 620 (Fig. 64) are adapted and configured to engage with a pawl 614g housed
in an opening in left handle portion 614 (Fig. 79(A)).
[00064]          Tube collars (Figs. 66-67) are essentially mirror images of each other (across a
vertical centerplane of the device 1000) and cooperate to define a hollow, generally cylindrical
interior for receiving proximal end 512 of tube 510. In particular, lugs 632a, 634a are provided
to mate with openings 518 near the proximal end 512 of tube 510 (Fig. 69). Tube collars also
define radially oriented detents 632b, 634b along their proximal faces to mate with raised
portions 644b on the distal face of roticulator plate 644 (Fig. 68). Roticulator plate 644 further
includes a proximal portion 644c having a square cross section for being received by the left and
right housing side portions 612, 614.
[00065]          Roticulator plate 644 is received in housing 614 between adjacent ribs 614r (Fig.
70) as is cable disc 648. Cable disc 648 (Figs. 71-72) defines a circumferential groove 648b
about its periphery for mating with a rib 614r as well as an annularly-shaped channel 648a in its
distal face for receiving a roticulator spring 646. Spring 646 is adapted and configured to urge
roticulator plate into contact with detents 632b, 634b to facilitate stepwise rotational movement.
cable disc 648 further defines a plurality of openings 648c therethrough to permit passage of
cables/wires 172, 174, 176, 178, 532, 534 and 551.

[00066]          As illustrated in Figs. 73-74, a cable path guide 650 is provided for directing
cables 172, 174, 176, 178, 532, 534 through the handle 600. In particular, guide 650 provides a
first set of guides 654 for guiding cables 172, 174, 176, 178, and a second set of guides, or
bosses, 652, 654 for directing cables 532, 534 through the handle 600. Grooves 658 are provided
in guide 650 for receiving ribs 612r of right housing portion 612 (Fig. 79(D)).
[00067]          Figs. 75-76 illustrate a cutaway view of handle 600 wherein right housing portion
612 has been removed to permit view of interior components of handle 600. Fig. 75 illustrates
trigger 700, or actuator, in a locked position, whereas Fig. 76 illustrates trigger 700 in a released
position wherein the trigger can be depressed, thus advancing needle (e.g., 300) about needle
track 140. As illustrated in Figs. 75-76, handle includes trigger 700, pull cable/ribbon 710,
trigger spring capsule 720, trigger return spring 730, pull cable 727, pulley 750 and brake handle
800 for preventing articulation knob 810 from being rotated. As stop surface 614s is defined in
left housing 614 to define a stop point for trigger 700 when trigger 700 is locked. Right housing
612 includes a similar stop feature 612s (Fig. 79(D)). Articulation knob 810 (Fig. 77(E))
includes a handle portion 812, an elongate shaft 814 for engaging with brake rotate fitting 830
(Fig. 83), and a distal portion 816 that is preferably threaded for receiving a hex nut 886 (Fig.
90). Right and left handle cap portions 616, 618 (Figs. 77(A)-77(D)) are provided with bosses
616a, 618a for receiving and supporting the edges 835b of brake springs 835 (Fig. 84). Bearing
portion 835a of brake springs 835 bear against brake rotate fittings 830, which in turn urges
brake rotate fittings 830 against shaft 814 of knob 810. Portion 814 of knob 810 preferably
includes a resilient layer or coating that can grip serrated portion 834 of fittings 830, wherein
rotation of the knob 810 causes the fittings 830, and hence cables 532, 534 to advance along a
proximal-distal direction with respect to device 1000, resulting in articulation of suture head 100,
100'. Fig. 78 illustrates handle 600 with components 810, 616, 618 removed. Figs. 79(A)-79(D)
illustrate inner and outer views of left and right handle portions 612, 614. Figs. 80-81 illustrate
the inner workings of handle 600 with both handle portions 612, 614 removed with the trigger
700 locked, and released, respectively. Fig. 82 illustrates a close up view of the inner workings
of handle 600, showing the upper brake pad 820 removed, fully revealing the positioning of
fittings 830 and springs 835 with the trigger 700 released. Also illustrated is knuckle pulley 842,
which is rotationally supported by knuckle pulley holder 840, which in turn is biased by a guide
                                                    23

spring 845 against bracket 870 to maintain tension on cables 532, 534. Figs. 83-85 further
illustrate fittings 830, spring 835 and spring 845.
[00068]           Figs. 86(A)-86(B) illustrate the movement of shuttle 888 (Figs 99(A)-99(B)),
which moves proximally upon the release of trigger 700. Proximal movement of shuttle 888
prevents handle 892r from being articulated, which, in turn, prevents guides 120, 130 from being
withdrawn into suture head 100, 100' while trigger 700 is actuated, advancing the needle (e.g.,
300) about circular needle track 140, 140'. Components 830, 835 have been removed in Fig. 86
to better illustrate lower brake pad 850. Brake pads 820, 850 are preferably made from resilient
and somewhat compressible material, such as silicone. Fig. 87(A) further illustrates lower brake
pad 850, while Figs. 87(B)-87(D) illustrate brake bracket 860. Bracket 860 defines a circular
boss 862 thereon for receiving lower brake pad 850, as well as brake handle components 882,
884, 884a (Fig. 91(B)). Figs. 88-89(A) illustrate remaining inner workings of handle with brake
pad removed (Fig. 88) and further with pulley holder 840 and brake bracket 860 removed. Figs.
89(A)-89(B) further illustrates coupling knuckle 872, which includes longitudinal openings 872a
having narrowed portions 872c that are wide enough to permit passage of a cable 532, 534, but
not wide enough to permit passage of cable terminations 874 (Fig. 91). Opening 872b, in
contrast, is large enough to permit terminations 874 to pass into knuckle 872, thus joining cable
532 to cable 534, and providing a closed loop to facilitate articulation by way of articulation and
brake control 800. Brake trigger 884 can be pulled, causing a camming effect of by moving an
upper portion of handle component 882 (and its counterpart on the left side of the device) into
contact with lower brake pad 850, causing the brake pad 850 to compress components 830
between the upper and lower brake pads 820, 850.
[00069]           Figs. 92-102 illustrate aspects of the operation and control for the guides 120, 130
as well as the locking mechanism for trigger 700. Guides 120, 130 are deployed or withdrawn
by rotating handles 892. Cables 172-178 are routed over guide 885, which is held in place by
housing components 612, 614 and are split up into two pairs of wires, wherein one set of wires is
directed downwardly around spring loaded pulleys 894a, 896a and routed up to handles 192
where all four cables, 172, 174, 176, 178 are held in place in openings 892b in handles 892 by
tapered pins 893. The other pair of cables is routed about guide 887 directly into handles 892.

Guide 885 (Fig. 93(B)) is a generally curved planar member having a plurality of cable guides
885a, wherein the cables 172-178 bear over its upper surface on their route to handles 892. Fig.
93(A) illustrates guides 887 and 885 in situ in relation to other internal components of handle
600. Guide 887 (Figs. 93(C)-93(D)) include bosses 887a to be received by housing portions 612,
614, and grooves 887b defined by fins 887c for routing cables/wires. Handles 892 include grips
892a and grooves 892c and channels 892d for directing cables/wires into openings 892b (Figs.
94(A)-94E). Both handles 892 can be essentially identical in form.
[00070]         Guide handles 892 also play a role in releasing trigger lock 780, thereby
permitting trigger 700 to actuate the movement of needle (e.g., 300). As illustrated in Figs.
95(A)-95(B), trigger lock 780 is attached to a cable at ferrule 781, which is disposed in opening
783 at bifurcation 782 of trigger lock (Figs. 95(C)-95(D)). Trigger lock 780 is slidably disposed
on a cylindrical rail 786, and is biased toward a locked position by spring 787. A bifurcation 784
at the opposite end of trigger lock 780 is adapted and configured to interlock with trigger 700.
When the cable to which ferrule 781 is attached is advanced upwardly (Fig. 95(B)) by rotating
handle 892L, bifurcation 784 of trigger lock 780 disengages from trigger 700, permitting free
movement of trigger. Handles 892L, 892R are pivotally disposed on axle 891 (Figs. 96, 122).
Figs. 97-101 further illustrate additional features of the actuation system for guides 120, 130 with
progressively additional components removed to better illustrate other components, and their
relative positions. Fig. 102 further illustrates additional aspects and views of components 840,
894, 896.
[00071]         Figs. 103-113 illustrate aspects of the operation of reciprocating trigger
mechanism 700. Fig. 103 illustrates the relative positions of trigger 700, pull cable/ribbon 710,
trigger spring capsule 720, trigger return spring 730, pull cable 727 and pulley 750. Fig. 103
removes components 786, 787 and handle 700 to reveal ferrule 752, which is fixed to a terminal
end of pull cable 727 and resides within an opening 701 within handle 700 (Fig. 105). Trigger
700 is further illustrated in Figs. 106(A)-106(B) from two additional angles, showing bifurcated
yoke 702 proximate the top end of trigger 700. Yoke cap 704 is received in trigger handle 700
by securing studs 704a into holes 700a by interference fit and/or ultrasonic welding, adhesive or
the like.  Yoke 702 and yoke cap 704 define openings 702a, 704a therein for receiving bosses

888a of shuttle link 888 (Fig. 99(B)). Fig. 107(A) illustrates the interior of capsule 720,
revealing clutch spring 724. Figs. 107(B)-107(C) illustrate housing portion 720a, which mates
with housing portion 720b. Housing portion 720b is an identical mirror image of portion 720a,
so only 720a is illustrated. Clutch spring 724 is removed in Fig. 108, clearly illustrating pull
cable 727, clutch spring ferrule 723 and clutch washer 726. Fig. 109 illustrates the assembly
with spring 730 and housing portion 720b removed. Fig. 110 illustrates a closeup of the
connection of drive member 710 to assembly 720, showing the manner in which tabs 711, 712 at
proximal end of drive member 710 are bent and inserted through the slot 721a in washer plate
721. O-rings 720, which may be silicone or other suitable material, are illustrated in Figs. 104
and 109. O-rings 729 provide a seal against housing segments 612, 614. Ferrule 723 is secured
to cable 727. Figs. 111-113 provide closer views of ferrule 723, washer plate 721 and proximal
end of member 710, respectively.
[00072]         Figs. 114-120 further illustrate the connections between drive member 710 and
drive members 150/551. As illustrated in Fig. 114, proximal drive member, which can include
ribbon-element 150 described above attached to intermediate cable section 551 in intermediate
region 500, is received by a ferrule 910 which is affixed in place after termination 930 is
attached, and positioned into cavity 922 in coupling by passing cable/rod 551 through slot 924 in
coupling 920. Rounded portion 932 of termination faces distally, permitting movement between
member 551 and coupling 920. As illustrated in Figs. 115-117, termination 930 defines a
passage 936 therethrough for receiving cable 551, and defines a generally cylindrical proximal
section 934. Ferrule 910 defines a passage 912 therethrough for receiving cable 551, and a
transverse opening 914 therethrough, such as for receiving brazing or soldering material or other
material for holding ferrule in place on cable 551. Coupling 920 includes a proximal face 922a,
a distal face 928 and a bore 922 therethrough. As illustrated in Fig. 114 in cooperation with
Figs. 118-120, threaded male fitting 940 is received within threaded opening 922 of coupling,
and receives a retaining hex nut 950 thereon. Proximal end 943 of fitting 940 faces proximally,
and defines a cavity 946 therein for receiving distal tip 717 of drive ribbon/cable 710. Tip 717 is
inserted into cavity 946 until stop 719 contacts proximal face 943. Threads 942, 952 are defined

like. Figs. 121-122 illustrate torsion spring 960 and guide spring 970 and their positioning with
respect to the other components within handle 600. Springs 960, 970 are a part of the control
mechanism for deploying and retracting guides 120, 130. Return spring 895, 897 is illustrated in
Fig. 121(C).
[00073]          An exemplary method of operation of suture head 100 is set forth in Figures 123
131. Fig. 123 illustrates a cutaway view of suture head 100 with needle 300 disposed therein in a
delivery configuration with guides 120, 130 retracted. Needle 300 is wholly contained within
device 1000, and pawl spring 115b prevents needle 300 from moving in a counterclockwise
direction. Similarly, pawl spring 115a is biased against the inner circumferential surface 322 of
needle, tending to prevent needle from moving in a clockwise direction. As set forth in Figs.
123-131, it is apparent from the instant disclosure that the drive system of the device 1000 is
adapted and configured to advance the needle 300 in multiple 3600 revolutions about the needle
track when the needle track is in a deployed condition. It is further evident that the needle track
is about 1800 in extent prior to deployment, and greater than 180' in angular extent after
deployment.
[00074]          Fig. 124 illustrates the initial deployment of guides. Pawl 115a is dragged along
surface 322 of needle 300 until it engages with notch 308 and pawl 11 5b engages with notch
306. Guides are then fully retracted in Fig. 125, and pawl 115a situated in guide 120 drags
needle 300 in a clockwise direction to present it for suturing. Pawl 160 meanwhile is advanced
along its arcuate track along guides 120, 130 to its distalmost extent, causing notch 158 in the
drive member 150 to align with boss 108a, and pawl 115b bears against surface 122 of needle
300. When drive member 150 is then pulled proximally, notched region 158 of member 150
slips past bosses 106a, 108a and drive member 150 drops into lower passage defined in part by
passage 108T. Further proximal movement of drive member 150 causes the distally located
wider portion of ribbon 150 to bear against the underside of bosses 106a, 108a, and pawl 160
makes contact with the trailing end of the needle 300, and needle is advanced about 1800, as
illustrated in Fig. 126. The distal movement of pawl 160 is then repeated, such that pawl 160
engages with notch 310 in needle 300. Region 158 slips past bosses 106a, 108a as before, and
pawl 160 and the leading tip 302 of needle are pulled along the arcuate needle track 140,

resulting in the needle being returned to its starting point, as illustrated in Fig. 128. Fig. 129
illustrates guides 120, 130 in partial retraction such that needle is moved counterclockwise until
notch 306 meets with pawl 115b. Fig. 130 illustrates guides 120, 130 retracted even further,
illustrating how pawl 115a is pulled out of notch 308 and is dragged along surface 322 of needle.
further counterclockwise movement of needle 300 is prevented by pawl 115b being locked into
notch 306. Fig. 131 illustrates suture head 110 once again in delivery or removal configuration
with guides 120, 130 fully withdrawn. Thus, a device is provided herein that can rotate the
disclosed needle through 180', 360', or any further multiple of 1800 as desired. If desired, the
angular increments of advancement could be increments of more or less than 1800 as desired.
[00075]         The suturing devices of the presently disclosed embodiments can be used for
laparoscopic procedures, including but not limited to laparoscopic colostomy, colectomy,
adrenalectomy, splenectomy, repair of paraesophageal hernia, inguinal hernia repair, ventral
hernia repair, Nissen fundoplication, liver lobectomy, gastrectomy, small bowel resection,
treatment of small bowel obstruction, distal pancreatectomy, nephrectomy and gastric bypass.
Those skilled in the art will recognize that the presently disclosed embodiments can be used in
other laparoscopic procedures.
[00076]         In using the devices of the presently disclosed embodiments, the abdomen is
insufflated with gas to create a working space for the user. Any gas known to those skilled in the
art including, but not limited to, nitrogen or carbon dioxide, can be used. Access portals are
established using trocars in locations to suit the particular surgical procedure. A variety of
surgical instruments may then be inserted into the body through these access ports/cannulas. The
user then introduces the distal end portion of the suturing device into a cannula, and then
articulates the suture head assembly (e.g., 100, 100'). The suture head assembly is then
positioned relative to the tissue/vessel to be sutured together, and the user preferably locks the
suture head assembly in place. The user then, through manipulation of the suturing device,
positions a plurality of separated tissue segments into the opening defined at the distal end
portion of the suture head assembly. The user, using only one hand, may manipulate the device
while actuating the handle to close an incision with a continuous suture whose stitches may be
individually tensioned precisely and uniformly along the length of the suture similar to suturing
                                                   28

    WO 2012/044998                                                               PCT/US2011/054334
done by hand in the conventional way. The user may employ a single suture which would
extend the entire length of the incision or multiple sutures. Thus, by placement of the device
spanning the incised tissue segments and actuating the handle, the suturing device enables the
user to lay down a running stitch or interrupted stitch to close the tissue incision in a time
efficient manner. Those skilled in the art will recognize that any conventional procedure for
conducting laparoscopic surgery can be used with the device.
[00077]         The minimalized structural design of the suture head assembly enables the user to
have a clear, unobstructed view of the suturing needle during advancement through the tissue
segments during the course of a suturing operation, thereby enabling precise placement of the
suturing device to provide uniform sutures and precluding the risk of tearing tissue by placement
too close to the edge of the incision. The suturing device is then advanced a short distance along
the incision and the aforementioned operation is repeated to produce another stitch comprising
the suturing material or thread.
[00078]         The user may continue to manipulate the suturing device, alternately advancing
and actuating rotation of the needle about an axis that is generally parallel to the direction of
advancement to create a continuous suture which may extend through the entire length of the
incision or a series of interrupted stitches. After each individual stitch is laid down, the stitch is
tightened by exerting a pull on the suturing material or thread so that the resultant suture is
tensioned uniformly along the length of the incised tissue segments. Therefore, a tight closure of
the segments is accomplished and bleeding and tearing of tissue are minimized. Once the
appropriate amount of suture material or thread 246 has been placed, the user can use a needle
grasper to tighten and knot the formed stitches.
