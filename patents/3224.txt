Description of Related Art
[0003]    A positive electrode active material for a nonaqueous electrolyte secondary
battery for application to large-sized power machines, such as electric vehicles, is
required to have high output characteristics and high durability.    In order to obtain high
output characteristics, in a positive electrode active material having a structure in which
a large number of primary particles are aggregated to form secondary particles, it is
effective, for example, to have a hollow structure in each secondary particle to increase
the BET specific surface area, and to reduce the size of aggregated primary particles of
each secondary particle.     However, in such a positive electrode active material, one or
more cracks may occur in the secondary particles due to pressurization in the formation

                                               2
of an electrode, expansion/shrinkage upon charge and discharge, etc., and there has been
room for improvement in durability.
[0004]    In relation to the above, a positive electrode active material in which the
number of primary particles forming one secondary particle is reduced has been
proposed (see, e.g., JP 2001-243949 A).       In addition, a positive electrode active
material in which primary particles are monodispersed has been proposed (see, e.g., JP
2004-355824 A).
                                         SUMMARY
[0005] A positive electrode active material for a nonaqueous electrolyte secondary
battery includes particles of a lithium-transition metal composite oxide that contains
nickel in the composition thereof and has a layered structure.       The particles have an
average particle size DSEM based on electron microscopic observation in a range of 1 pm
to 7 pm, in which ratio D5/DSEM of a 50% particle size D5 in volume-based cumulative
particle size distribution to the average particle size based on electron microscopic
observation is in a range of I to 4, and a ratio D9o/Dio of a 90% particle size D9o to a
10% particle size Dio in volume-based cumulative particle size distribution is 4 or less.

                                              5
electrode described above.
[0026] According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, a positive electrode
active material for a nonaqueous electrolyte secondary battery can be provided in which
both high output power characteristics and high durability can be achieved.
[0027] A positive electrode active material for a nonaqueous electrolyte secondary
battery according the present disclosure will be described in the description below based
on embodiments.      However, the following embodiments are intended to embody the
technical concept of the present invention, and the scope of the present invention is not
limited thereto.   In the present specification, the content of each component in a

a component are present in the composition, the total amount of the plurality of
substances present in the composition unless otherwise specified.
POSITIVE ELECTRODE ACTIVE MATERIAL FOR NONAQUEOUS
ELECTROLYTE SECONDARY BATTERY
[0028] A positive electrode active material for a nonaqueous electrolyte secondary
battery according to one embodiment of the present disclosure (hereinafter sometimes
simply referred to as "positive electrode active material") includes particles of a
lithium-transition metal composite oxide containing nickel in the composition thereof
and having a layered structure.    The particles have the average particle size DSEM based
on electron microscopic observation in a range of 1 pm to 7 pm, in which the ratio
D5/DSEM of the    50% particle size D5 in volume-based cumulative particle size
distribution to the average particle size based on electron microscopic observation is in
a range of I to 4, and the ratio D9o/Dio of the 90% particle size Dqo to the 10% particle

                                              6
size Dio in volume-based cumulative particle size distribution is 4 or less.
[0029]    The positive electrode active material contains lithium-transition metal
composite oxide particles (hereinafter sometimes simply referred to as "composite oxide
particles") having the average particle size  DSEM  based on electron microscopic
observation in a range of I pm to 7 pm, the value of D5/DSEM in a range of I to 4, and
the value of D9o/Dio of 4 or less.    The value of D5/DSEM in a range of I to 4 indicates
that the composite oxide particles are composed of a single primary particle or a small
number of primary particles (hereinafter both may simply referred to as "a single
particle"), having reduced contact grain boundaries between primary particles.       In
addition, the value of D9o/Dio of 4 or less indicates that the composite oxide particles
have a narrow distribution width in volume-based cumulative particle size distribution,
and the particle size is substantially uniform.   With these features, high output
characteristics and high durability can be both achieved.
[0030]    As compared with a positive electrode active material containing
lithium-transition metal composite oxide particles having secondary particles made of a
large number of aggregated primary particles, in a conventional positive electrode active
material containing lithium-transition metal composite oxide particles, which are single
particles, a decrease in capacity retention ratio due to the disconnection of the electrical
conduction path of lithium ions caused by the grain boundary dissociation of secondary
particles during a charge/discharge cycle is prevented, and also an increase in the
diffusion/migration resistance of lithium ions is prevented.     Accordingly, good
durability is exhibited.   Meanwhile, in such a conventional positive electrode active
material, a three-dimensional grain boundary network as in a positive electrode active
material made of aggregated particles is hardly formed, and a high-power design

                                               7
utilizing grain boundary conduction is difficult to achieve.       Therefore, there has been a
tendency that the output characteristics are insufficient.     It is believed that output
power characteristics can be increased by decreasing the particle size      (DSEM) of single
particles.   However, in the case where the particle size is too small, the interaction
between particles is increased, so that the electrode plate filling properties tend to be
greatly deteriorated.    Further, a decrease in powder fluidity may result in the handling
ability being greatly deteriorated.    Meanwhile, in particular, for obtaining a practical
energy density, a certain degree of the particle size is needed.      However, it is believed
that an increase in particle size tends to result in a greater lack of output power.
[0031]     The lithium-transition metal composite oxide particles according to one
embodiment of the present disclosure have more uniform particle size than that of
conventional single particles.
With this configuration, even in the case where the battery is charged and discharged at
a high current density, variations in charge/discharge depth among particles due to
current concentration on some particles can be reduced.         Accordingly, it is believed
that, while preventing increase in resistance due to current concentration, local
degradation through charge/discharge cycles can be reduced.
[0032]     Further, with uniform particle size of lithium-transition metal composite oxide
particles having reduced grain boundaries, the particles do not collapse even when
pressed at a high pressure in the manufacturing of an electrode.        Accordingly, the space
between particles is considered to be homogenized.        In addition, in the case where a
battery is formed, the space between particles is filled with an electrolyte to serve as a
lithium ion diffusion path.    With uniform size of such a diffusion path, variations in
amount of charge/discharge among particles can be reduced.            Accordingly, it is

                                               8
considered that, even lithium-transition metal composite oxide particles having reduced
contact grain boundaries between primary particles can achieve good output power
characteristics while ensuring electrode plate filling performance.
[0033]    Further, generally, in the case where single particles are synthesized, heat
treatment is needed to be performed under high temperature for growth of particles.        In
particular, in a composition having a high Ni proportion, when calcination is performed
at a high temperature, the element Ni may be incorporated into the Li site, that is,
so-called disorder may occur.      Disorder inhibits the diffusion of Li ions in composite
oxide particles and causes resistance, resulting in effects such as a decrease in
charge/discharge capacity at a practical current density, a decrease in output
characteristics, etc.  Therefore, it is preferable that such disorder be suppressed.
Suppressing disorder allows for further improving the capacity and output power
characteristics in single particles.
[0034]    In the composite oxide particles forming the positive electrode active material,
the average particle size  DSEM  based on electron microscopic observation is in a range
of 1 pm to 7 pm in view of durability.      The average particle size DSEM based on
electron microscopic observation is determined as follows.        Using a scanning electron
microscope (SEM), observation is performed at a magnification of 1,000 to 10,000 in
accordance with the particle size.     One hundred particles having recognizable profiles
are selected, and the equivalent spherical diameters of the selected particles are
calculated using an image processing software.       The arithmetic average of the obtained
equivalent spherical diameters is determined as    DSEM.
[0035]    In the composite oxide particles, the ratio D5/DSEM of the 50% particle size
D5   in volume-based cumulative particle size distribution to the average particle size

                                                  9
DSEM   based on electron microscopic observation is in a range of 1 to 4.         In the case
where   D5/DSEM     is 1, the composite oxide particles are single particles.    In the case
where   D5/DSEM     is closer to 1, the composite oxide particles are made of small number
of primary particles.       In view of durability, it is preferable that D5/DSEM be in a range
of 1 to 4.    In view of power output density, it is preferable that D5/DSEM be 3 or less,
particularly preferably 2.5 or less.
[0036]     Further, the 50% particle size D5 of the composite oxide particles is in a range
of 1 pm to 21 pm, for example.          In view of power output density, it is preferable that
D5o be 1.5 pm or more, more preferably 3 pm or more, and be 8 pm or less, more
preferably 5.5 pm or less.
[0037]     The 50% particle size D5 is determined as a particle size corresponding to a
cumulative percentage of 50% from the smaller particle size side in the volume-based
cumulative particle size distribution measured under wet conditions using a laser
diffraction particle size distribution analyzer.       Similarly, the 90% particle size D9o and
10% particle size Dio described below are determined as particle sizes corresponding to
cumulative percentages of 90% and 10%, respectively, from the smaller particle size
side.
[0038]     In the composite oxide particles, the ratio of 90% particle size D9o to 10%
particle size Dio in volume-based cumulative particle size distribution indicates the
width of particle size distribution.      The smaller the value is, the more uniform the
particle size.    D9o/Dio is 4 or less.    In view of power density, it is preferable that
D9o/Dio is 3 or less, more preferably 2.5 or less.        The lower limit of D9o/Dio is 1.2 or
more, for example.
[0039]     The lithium-transition metal composite oxide contains nickel in the

                                                10
composition thereof and has a layered structure.       Examples of such lithium-transition
metal composite oxides include lithium-nickel composite oxides and
lithium-nickel-cobalt-manganese composite oxides.         Among them, a lithium-transition
metal composite oxide preferably has a composition represented by the following
formula (1).
          LipNixCoyM02+a                        (1)
          In formula (1), p, x, y, z, and c satisfy 1.0  p   1.3, 0.3   x   0.95, 0  y < 0.4,
0<!z<!0.5, x + y + z = 1, and -0.1      Ca   0.1, and M' represents at least one of Mn and
Al.
[0040]    The lithium-transition metal composite oxide particles may be doped with an
element other than the elements forming the lithium-transition metal composite oxide.
Examples of an element for doping include B, Na, Mg, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Zn, Sr,
Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, In, Sn, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Ta, W, and Bi.         Examples of
compounds used for doping with these elements include oxides and fluorides containing
at least one element selected from the group consisting of these elements, and Li
composite oxides thereof.      The amount of doping may be, for example, 0.005 mol% or
more and 10 mol% or less with respect to the lithium-transition metal composite oxide
particles, for example.
[0041]    The lithium-transition metal composite oxide particles may include core
particles containing a lithium-transition metal composite oxide and a deposit disposed
on the core particle surface.    The deposit should be disposed on at least a portion of the
core particle surface, and is preferably disposed in a region of 1% or more of the surface
area of the core particles.   The composition of the deposit is suitably selected in
accordance with the purpose and the like, and examples thereof include oxides and

                                               11
fluorides containing at least one kind selected from the group consisting of B, Na, Mg,
Si, P, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, In, Sn, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Ta,
W, and Bi, as well as Li-composite oxides thereof.      The content of deposit may be, for
example, in a range of 0.03 mass% to 10 mass%, preferably 0.1 mass% to 2 mass%, of
the lithium-transition metal composite oxide particles.
[0042]    The composition of lithium-transition metal composite oxide contains nickel.
In the lithium-transition metal composite oxide, in view of the initial efficiency in a
nonaqueous electrolyte secondary battery, the disorder of nickel element determined by
X-ray diffractometry is preferably 4.0% or less, more preferably 2.0% or less, and still
more preferably 1.5% or less.       The expression "disorder of nickel element" refers to
chemical disorder of nickel ions generated in a site of transition metal ions.    In a
lithium-transition metal composite oxide having a layered structure, such a disorder is
typically an exchange between lithium ions that occupies the site represented by 3b
when expressed in the Wyckoff symbol (i.e., 3b site, the same applies hereinafter) and
transition metal ions that occupies the 3a site.    The smaller disorder of nickel element
is, the more initial efficiency is improved, and thus is more preferable.
[0043]    The disorder of elemental nickel in a lithium-transition metal composite oxide
can be determined by X-ray diffractometry.        The X-ray diffraction spectrum of a
lithium -transition metal composite oxide is measured using a CuKa ray.        The
composition model is represented by Lil-dNidMeO2 (wherein Me is transition metals
other than nickel in the lithium-transition metal composite oxide), and structural
optimization is performed by Rietveld analysis based on the obtained X-ray diffraction
spectrum.     The percentage of d calculated as a result of structural optimization is
determined as the value of elemental nickel disorder.

composition represented by formula (1), in one embodiment of the present invention,

METHOD FOR PRODUCING POSITIVE ELECTRODE ACTIVE MATERIAL
[0049]     Lithium-transition metal composite oxide particles contained in the positive
electrode active material according to the present disclosure can be produced by a
method including: mixing a lithium compound and an oxide having a desired
composition to obtain a raw material mixture; and subjecting the obtained raw material
mixture to a heat treatment.        The heat-treated product resulting from the heat treatment
may be subjected to a crushing treatment, and may further be subjected to a treatment
for removing unreacted substances, by-products, and the like by washing with water, etc.

                                              14
The product may further be subjected to a dispersion treatment, a classification
treatment, and the like.
[0050]    Examples of methods of obtaining an oxide having a desired composition
include: a method in which raw material compounds (hydroxide, carbonate, etc.) are
mixed according to the intended composition and decomposed into an oxide by a heat
treatment; a coprecipitation method in which a raw material compound soluble in a

or adding of a complexing agent, for example, is performed to obtain a precipitate of a
precursor in accordance with the intended composition, and the precursors are subjected
to a heat treatment to obtain an oxide; and the like.

be described in the case where the lithium-transition metal composite oxide is
represented by formula (1) shown below.
[0052]    It is preferable that the method of obtaining a raw material mixture includes:
providing a composite oxide containing nickel, cobalt, and at least one of manganese
and aluminum by a coprecipitation method; and mixing the obtained composite oxide

solution containing metal ions in a desired composition to obtain seed crystals; a
crystallization step of growing the formed seed crystals to obtain a composite hydroxide
having desired characteristics; and a step of subjecting the obtained composite
hydroxide to a heat treatment to obtain a composite oxide.     The details of the method

reference in their entirety).
[0054]    The composite oxide obtained by a coprecipitation method has a value of
D9o/Dio, which serves as an index of particle size distribution, of 3 or less, for example,
preferably 2 or less.    In addition, D5  is 12 pm or less, for example, preferably 6 pm or
less, and more preferably 4 pm or less, and is 1 pm or more, for example, preferably 2
pm or more.
[0055]    The content ratio Ni/Co/(Mn + Al) of nickel, cobalt, and manganese +
aluminum in the composite oxide may be 1/1/1, 6/2/2, or 8/1/1, for example.
[0056]    It is preferable that the raw material mixture contains a lithium compound in
addition to the composite oxide.       Examples of lithium compounds include lithium
carbonate, lithium hydroxide, and lithium oxide.       The particle size of the lithium
compound used is, as D5, in a range of 0.1 pm to 100 pm, for example, preferably in a
range of 2 pm to 20 pm.       The content of lithium with respect to the raw material
mixture may be, as Li/(Ni + Co + Mn + Al), 1.0 or more and 1.3 or less, for example,
preferably 1.2 or less.    The composite oxide and the lithium compound may be mixed,
for example, using a high-speed shear mixer or the like, for example.
[0057]    The obtained raw material mixture is subjected to a heat treatment, which
allows for obtaining lithium-transition metal composite oxide particles.       The heat
treatment is performed under a temperature in a range of 700 'C to 1,100 'C, for
example.      The heat treatment may be performed at a single temperature, or may also be
performed at a plurality of temperatures.      In the case where the heat treatment is
performed at a plurality of temperatures, for example, it is possible to perform a first
heat treatment at a temperature in a range of 700 'C to 925 'C, and then perform a

                                              16
second heat treatment at a temperature in a range of 930 'C to 1,100 'C.         Further, a
third heat treatment may be additionally performed at a temperature in a range of 700
'C to 850 'C.
[0058]    The time of the heat treatment is in a range of 1 to 40 hours, for example.       In
the case where the heat treatment is performed at a plurality of temperatures, each
treatment may be performed for in a range of 1 to 10 hours.         The heat treatment may
be performed in the air or an oxygen atmosphere.
[0059]    The heat-treated product may be subjected to a crushing treatment, a dispersion
treatment, a classification treatment, and the like.     As a result, desired
lithium-transition metal composite oxide particles can be obtained.
[0060]    In addition, after being subjected to a crushing treatment, a dispersion
treatment, a classification treatment, or the like, the heat-treated product may be further
mixed with a lithium compound to obtain a mixture, followed by an additional heat
treatment.    In the case where a lithium compound is further mixed, the content of
lithium in the mixture may be, for example, represented as Li/(Ni + Co + Mn + Al), and
may be in a range of 1.05 to 1.3, preferably 1.1 to 1.2.      In addition, the additional heat
treatment may be performed at a temperature in a range of 850 'C to 1,000 'C,
preferably in a range of 870 'C to 950 'C.      It is preferable that the temperature be
lower than the temperature of the heat treatment of the raw material mixture.         The heat
treatment time of the additional heat treatment may be, for example in a range of 2
hours to 15 hours.     After the additional heat treatment, a crushing treatment, a
dispersion treatment, a classification treatment, or the like may be performed.

example.
EXAMPLES
[0064]    Examples of the present invention will be described below in detail.
[0065]    First, methods of measuring physical properties in examples and comparative
examples in the below will be described.
[0066]    The value of Dio, D5, and D9o were determined by, with use of a laser
diffraction particle size distribution analyzer (SALD-3 100 manufactured by Shimadzu
Corporation), measuring volume-based cumulative particle size distribution, and
calculating the value of each of Dio, D5, and D9o corresponding to the respective
cumulative percentages from the smaller particle size side were determined.
[0067]    The average particle size  DSEM  based on electron microscopic observation was
determined as follows.     In an image observed at a magnification of 1,000 to 10,000
using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), 100 particles having recognizable outlines
were selected, and the equivalent spherical diameters of the selected particles were
calculated using an image processing software (Image J).
The arithmetic average of the obtained equivalent spherical diameters was determined
as DSEM.
[0068]    The value of elemental nickel disorder (amount of Ni disorder) was determined
by X-ray diffractometry as below.
[0069]    The X-ray diffraction spectrum of obtained lithium-transition metal composite
oxide particles was measured using a CuKc ray under conditions of a tube current of 40
mA and a tube voltage of 40 k.        With the composition model being expressed as

                                             19
LiI-dNidMeO2 (wherein Me is transition metals other than nickel in the lithium-transition
metal composite oxide), based on the obtained X-ray diffraction spectrum, the structure
of the lithium-transition metal composite oxide particles was optimized by Rietveld
analysis using RIETAN-2000 software.       The percentage of d calculated as a result of
structural optimization was determined as the amount of Ni disorder.
Example 1
Seed Formation Step
[0070]    First, 10 kg of water was charged in a reaction tank, an aqueous ammonia
solution was added into water while stirring water, and the ammonium ion concentration
was adjusted to 1.8 mass%.      The temperature in the tank was set at 25 'C, and a
nitrogen gas was circulated in the tank to maintain the oxygen concentration of the inner
space of the reaction tank at 10 vol% or less.   A 25 mass% aqueous sodium hydroxide
solution was added to water in the reaction tank, and the pH value of the solution in the
tank was adjusted to 13.5 or more.
[0071] Next, a nickel sulfate solution, a cobalt sulfate solution, and a manganese
sulfate solution were mixed to prepare a mixed aqueous solution having a molar ratio of
1:1:1.
[0072]    The mixed aqueous solution was added to the solution in the reaction tank until
the solute content reached 4 mol, and, while controlling the pH value of the reaction
solution at 12.0 or more with a sodium hydroxide solution, seed formation was
performed.
Crystallization Step

                                             20
[0073]   After the seed formation step, the temperature in the tank was maintained at 25
 C or more until the completion of the crystallization step.   In addition, a mixed
aqueous solution having a solute content of 1,200 mol was prepared and added to the
reaction tank simultaneously with an aqueous ammonia solution while maintaining the
ammonium ion concentration in the solution at 2,000 ppm or more over 5 hours or more
so that no additional seed formation would take place in the reaction tank.    During the
reaction, the pH value of the reaction solution was controlled to be maintained in a
range of 10.5 to 12.0 with a sodium hydroxide solution.      Sampling was successively
performed during the reaction, and the addition was completed when the D5 of the
composite hydroxide particles reached about 4.5 pm.
[0074]   Next, the product was washed with water, filtered, and dried, so that composite
hydroxide particles are obtained.    The obtained hydroxide precursor was subjected to a
heat treatment at 300 'C for 20 hours in the ambient atmosphere, thereby obtaining a
composite oxide having the following properties: composition ratio Ni/Co/Mn      =
0.33/0.33/0.33, Dio = 3.4 pm, D5    = 4.5 pm, D9o  = 6.0 pm, D9o/D1o  =  1.8.
Synthesis Step
[0075]    The obtained composite oxide and lithium carbonate were mixed so that Li/(Ni
+ Co + Mn) becomes 1.15 to obtain a raw material mixture.        The obtained raw material
mixture was calcined in air at 925 'C for 7.5 hours and then calcined at 1,030 'C for 6
hours to obtain a sintered body.   The obtained sintered body was crushed, subjected to
a dispersion treatment in a ball mill made of resin for 10 minutes, and then dry-sieved to
obtain a powder.     The obtained powder was classified through a dry classifier into
three sizes (large, medium, and small), and medium-sized particles were collected.

                                               21
The proportion of medium-sized particles after classification relative to before
classification was 46 wt%.
[0076]    As a result, lithium-transition metal composite oxide particles represented by
the composition formula: Lii.i5Nio.33Coa.33Mno.3302 and having the following properties
were obtained: average particle size    DSEM  based on electron microscopic observation:
3.6 pm, Dio = 3.7 pm, D5 = 5.1 pm, D9o = 6.7 pm, ratio        D5/DSEM   of D5 to average
particle size DSEM: 1.4, ratio D9o/Dio in particle size distribution: 1.8, amount of Ni
disorder: 0.3%.    The physical property values of the obtained lithium-transition metal
composite oxide particles are shown in Table 1, and an SEM image thereof is shown in
Fig. 1.
Example 2
[0077]    Under the same conditions as in Example 1 except that the timing of the
completion of addition of a mixed aqueous solution in the crystallization step was
changed to the time where the value of D5 of composite hydroxide particles reached
about 3.0 pm, a composite oxide having the following properties was obtained:
composition ratio Ni/Co/Mn      = 0.33/0.33/0.33, Dio  = 2.2 pm, D5   =  3.0 pm, D9o = 4.1
pm, D9o/Dio =1.9.      The obtained composite oxide and lithium carbonate were mixed so
that Li/(Ni + Co + Mn) becomes 1.05 to obtain a raw material mixture.         The obtained
raw material mixture was calcined in air at 925 'C for 7.5 hours and then calcined at
1,030 'C for 6 hours to obtain a sintered body.     The obtained sintered body was
crushed, subjected to a dispersion treatment in a ball mill made of resin for 30 minutes,
and then dry-sieved to obtain a powder.      The obtained powder and lithium carbonate
were mixed so that Li/(Ni + Co + Mn) becomes 1.17 and calcined in air at 700 'C for 10

                                             22
hours to obtain a sintered body.   The obtained sintered body was crushed, subjected to
a dispersion treatment in a ball mill made of resin for 30 minutes, and then dry-sieved to
obtain powder.

the composition formula: Lii.17Nio.33Coa.33Mno.3302 and having the following properties
were obtained: average particle size DSEM: 1.2 pm, Dio = 1.4 pm, D5      = 3.2 pm, D9o  =
5.1 pm, ratio D5/DSEM of D5 to average particle size    DSEM: 2.7, ratio D9o/Dio in particle
size distribution: 3.6, amount of Ni disorder: 1.7%.   The physical property values of
the obtained lithium-transition metal composite oxide particles are shown in Table 1.

mixture was calcined in air at 925 'C for 7.5 hours and then calcined at 1,030 'C for 6
hours to obtain a sintered body.   The obtained sintered body was crushed, subjected to
a dispersion treatment in a ball mill made of resin for 30 minutes, and then dry-sieved to
provide powder. The obtained powder and lithium carbonate were mixed so that
Li/(Ni + Co + Mn) becomes 1.17 and calcined in air at 900 'C for 10 hours to obtain a
sintered body.    The obtained sintered body was crushed, subjected to a dispersion
treatment in a ball mill made of resin for 30 minutes, and then dry-sieved to give a

a dispersion treatment in a ball mill made of resin for 30 minutes, and then dry-sieved to
obtain a powder.     The obtained powder and lithium carbonate were mixed so that

EVALUATION
[0109]   Using the lithium-transition metal composite oxides obtained above as positive
electrode active materials, batteries for evaluation were produced as below.
Production of Positive Electrode
[0110]   Ninety six parts by mass of a positive electrode active material, 3 parts by mass
of acetylene black, and 1 part by mass of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were
dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to prepare a positive electrode mixture.
The obtained positive electrode mixture was applied to an aluminum foil that serves as a
current collector, dried, then compression-molded using a roll press, and cut into a
predetermined size, so that a positive electrode was produced.
Production of Negative Electrode
[0111]   Ninety six parts by mass of a negative electrode active material and 4 parts by
mass of PVDF were dispersed in NMP to prepare a negative electrode mixture.         The
obtained negative electrode mixture was applied to a copper foil as a current collector,
dried, then compression-molded using a roll press, and cut into a predetermined size, so
that a negative electrode was produced.
Production of Battery for Evaluation

                                              36
[0112]    Lead electrodes were attached to the positive electrode current collector and
the negative electrode current collector, respectively, then a separator was placed
between the positive electrode and the negative electrode, and they were housed in a
bag-shaped laminate pack.      Next, the laminate pack was vacuum-dried at 65 'C to
remove the moisture adsorbed on each member.          Subsequently, in an argon atmosphere,
an electrolyte solution was injected into the laminate pack and sealed.     The battery thus
obtained was placed in a thermostat at 25 'C and aged under a weak current.       For the
electrolyte solution, a solution prepared by mixing ethylene carbonate (EC) and
methylethyl carbonate (MEC) at a volume ratio of 3:7, and then dissolving lithium
hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) to a concentration of 1 mol/l, was used.
Charge/Discharge Test
[0113]    With respect to the batteries for evaluation obtained above, the power density
and durability were evaluated as below.
Power Density
[0114]    A battery for evaluation was discharged to 50% SOC and maintained under an
environment at 25 'C for 2 hours.      Subsequently, from the state where the SOC is 50%,
the battery was discharged at a constant current, the DC resistance after 10 seconds was
measured, and the power density was calculated.       The minimum discharge voltage was
set at 2.7 V.
Durability
[0115]    A charge/discharge cycle test was performed under a temperature condition of

                                                       37
60 'C.        In the charge/discharge cycle test, as one cycle, a battery was charged at a
constant current having a current density of 2.0 mA/cm 2 to the maximum charge voltage
of 4.2 V and then discharged at a constant current having a current density of 2.0
mA/cm 2 to the minimum discharge voltage of 2.7 V.                     This cycle was repeated 1,000
times in total.         Then, the discharge capacity was measured in each cycle, and durability
(%) was calculated using the following formula: (discharge capacity in the 1,000th
cycle/discharge capacity in the first cycle) x 100.                The evaluation results are shown in
Table 1.
