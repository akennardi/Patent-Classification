                   FOOTWEAR ARTICLE HAVING CORD STRUCTURE
   BACKGROUND/SUMMARY
   [0001]           The present Application is a Divisional Application from Australian Patent
   Application No. 2013342120.         The entire disclosures of Australian Patent Application
 5 No. 2013342120        and     its     corresponding     International     Patent     Application
   No. PCT/US2013/069311, are incorporated herein by reference.
   0001a]           Footwear construction typically relies on the manipulation of flat materials
   into three-dimension shapes in order to form a footwear article. Cloth, leather, or other
   materials may be cut and sewn or otherwise attached and wrapped around a foot form to
10 create a desired shape for the article, such as a footwear upper.
   [0002]           The Inventors have recognized several drawbacks with this traditional
   approach. For example, the material used to construct the upper may have only limited
   degrees of freedom in terms of flexibility, thereby limiting the ways in which the upper
   conforms to a wearer's foot and reducing comfort. As a result, even after the footwear is
15 worn for a considerable amount of time, it may still not fully conform to the actual contours
   of the wearer's foot.
   [0003]           To at least partially address the above issues, the inventors herein have taken
   alternative approaches to footwear construction. In one approach, at least a portion of the
   upper is formed via a plurality of intertwined cords. For example, the upper may be formed
20 from more than one uninterrupted cords engaging with itself and/or one or more additional
   cords at a plurality of intertwined, yet at least partially slipping, locations. Due to the
   slippable intertwined connections between cord sections, the overall shape or contour of the
   upper portion can change, while at the same time remain flexible. In this way, the upper
   portion can conform to a wearer's foot with ease, while remaining highly flexible and still
25 providing support.
   [0004]           In another example, a footwear article may include a looped upper with
   fibers or cords formed into a structure. In one example, the cords in the upper may be in
   slippable engagement with respect to one another and may be engaged at interfaces with a
   sole. The cords in the upper may also be interlocked with one another. The slippable
30 engagement may be formed at cord interfaces, the interfaces positioned along a loop line
   traversing across lateral and medial sides of the upper, and further across a forefoot and/or
   toe region. The looped upper may be formed in various grid-like patterns. The fiber or cord
   may comprise grasses, flaxes, and other fibrous plant material. Further, it may comprise
   artificial polyamides such as nylon, although organic polyamides may also be used. Still
35 further the cord may comprise a polymeric material.
                                                    1

   [00051          By providing a looped upper with cords slippable relative to one
   another in the upper, yet having reduced slip at a sole, it is possible to retain a
   functional footwear article that retained to the wearer's foot, while enabling the upper
   to form fit to the wearer's foot.     For example, the slip between the various cord
 5 interfaces enables each cord section between an interface to have a variable length so
   that the overall upper conforms to the actual shape of the wearer's foot.
   [0006]          It should be appreciated that although described in regards to slippable
   interfaces, there may be some embodiments and/or portions of the upper where
   slippage is limited (controlled) and/or prevented as it may not, in some embodiments,
10 be needed or necessary. For example, and not as a limitation, controlled slippage may
   be provided corresponding to a desired limitation on motion. For example, controlled
   slippage may be provided to address quick lateral movement where some slippage is
   provided but limited in distance and/or time. Further, in other embodiments, one or
   more regions of the upper may be configured for non-slippage, creating a more rigid,
15 non-slip or limited slip interface.    As an example, the range of slippage may be
   controlled by one or more of the slippable interfaces, the length of the cord sections,
   etc. Further, the type and position of the cord sections and interfaces may further be
   used to provide controlled slippage.
   [00071          In another example, a footwear article may comprise a sole coupled to
20 a cord structure. The cord structure may include interconnected bights in a vamp cord
   and a rand cord forming a loop line extending along at least a portion of the footwear
   article.   The vamp cord and rand cord may each be formed via one or more
   uninterrupted cords.
   [0008]          Interconnecting bights in the cord structure enables a 3-dimensional
25 form fitting structure to be provided in the footwear article. The connection between
   the bights can increase the range of motion and freedom of movement of the cord
   structure when compared to other footwear articles using sewn material which are
   wrapped around a foot form. As a result, the shape of the cord structure may adjust
   and conform to a foot with minimal wearing. Consequently, the footwear article's
30 comfort is increased.
   [0009]          This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a
   simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This
   Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [00181          A footwear article constructed of cords is described herein.        The
   footwear article may include interconnected bights in a cord structure providing a 3
20 dimensional form fitting construction.     The cord structure increases the range of
   motion of an upper part of the footwear article while retaining flexibility and comfort.
   The cord structure may conform highly to the shape of a foot during use due to the
   relative movement provided by the bights. For example, by providing an array of
   bight interconnections across the upper from a lateral to medial side, and across a
25 forefoot region, hundreds of adjustments, for example, can be automatically made by
   the cord structure so that the appropriate lengths of each cord section between the
   bights are achieved. As a result, the footwear's comfort is increased.
   [0019]          The example cord structures described herein also enable the
   manufacturing process of the footwear article to be simplified when compared to
30 other types of shoe construction which use a foot form.
   [0020]          FIG. 1 shows first example footwear article.         FIG. 2 shows an
   exploded view of a sole included in the footwear article shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 3
   shows an example intertwined pattern of cords in the footwear article shown in FIGS.
   l and 2.
                                              3

   [00211           FIGS. 4-9 show different views of a second example footwear article.
   FIGS. 10-15 show different views of a third example footwear article. FIGS. 16-21
   show additional example footwear articles and FIGS. 22-24 shows sections of
   different example soles.
 5 [0022]           FIG. 1 shows an example footwear article 50. The footwear article 50
   includes a sole 52. The sole 52 may be an insole/midsole, in one example. Thus, the
   insole and midsole may be single component in the footwear article. However, in
   other examples, the insole and midsole may be separate components in the footwear
   article. Further in one example, the footwear article 50 may also include an outsole.
10 However, in other examples the footwear article 50 may not include an outsole or the
   outsole may be integrated into the sole 52.
   [0023]           The sole 52 is attached to a cord structure 66. The cord structure 66 is
   included in an upper 67.        The cord structure may be formed from numerous cord
   sections interlocking with one another.       The cord may include string, twine, yam,
15 rope, cable, strands of braided or twisted materials, and/or other cord-like structures
   including combinations of the previously listed examples twisted together or
   otherwise combined. In one example, the cord includes nylon cord of approximately
   a 1/8" diameter, with an outer sheath and inner twine. Of course, other sizing may
   also be used. In another example, the cord may be double braided nylon, with an
20 inner braid filling a central void and an outer braid that may be of the same or
   different material. The cord may be flexible yet retain some of its shape in a free
   state. Further, the cord may have some elastomeric components.          Further, different
   cord sections (e.g., the vamp as compared to the rand) may have different degrees of
   flexibility, elasticity, etc. In one example, different materials may be used in different
25 sections of the cord structure 66. For instance, a more flexible type of cord may be
   used in an upper portion of the cord structure 66 and a less flexible type of cord may
   be used in a lower portion of the cord structure. Additionally, the portions of the cord
   structure coupled to the sole may be totally covered via the sole, in one example. In
   another example, the portions of the cord structure coupled to sole the may only be
30 partially covered. For instance, portions of the cord structure proximate to the toes
   may be covered while portions of the cord structure, proximate to a heel, may be
   uncovered or vice-versa. Covering portions of the cord structure reduces the
   likelihood of premature wear of the cord caused by abrasions from rocks, dirt, and/or
                                                4

   other particulates from the external environment. As a result, the footwear article's
   longevity is increased.
   [0024]          In one example, one or more cords in the cord structure 66 may extend
   through openings in the sole 52 to facilitate coupling of the sole to the cord structure.
 5 Additionally alternatively, a portion of the cord structure may be stitched, adhesively
   bonded (e.g., glued), and/or snapped into the sole to enable the coupling of the sole
   and the cord structure. In another example, a plurality of anchor points attached to the
   cord structure may be fixedly attached (e.g., injection molded into) to the sole. The
   anchor points may be individual cord loops.
10 [00251          In one example, the cord structure 66 may be a looped upper. In such
   an example, the looped upper may be formed in a grid-like pattern, but substantially
   free of knots at a plurality of the slippable interfaces positioned away from the sole
   52.
   [0026]          The cord structure 66 may be an upper of the footwear article 50. The
15 cord structure 66 may at least partially enclose a foot. The cord structure 66 includes
   a rand substructure 68. The rand substructure is coupled to the sole 52. Specifically
   in one example, sole attachment bights in the rand substructure 68 may be coupled to
   and/or extend through attachment openings in the sole.            In one example, the
   attachment bights may be formed via a single cord in the rand substructure 68. Thus,
20 a single cord may have multiple bights. A bight is a curved portion or section of a
   greater cord in the cord structure 66. Thus, a bight may be a portion of a loop in a
   cord.
   [00271          The rand substructure 68 further includes vamp attachment bights 74.
   The vamp attachment bights 74 are coupled (e.g., interconnected, interlocked,
25 stitched, intertwined, and/or slidingly engaged) to rand attachment bights 76 included
   in a vamp substructure 78 in the cord structure 66. The interconnection between the
   vamp attachment bights 74 and the rand attachment bights forms a loop line 69. The
   loop line 69 may be an interface between the rand substructure 68 and the vamp
   substructure 78. The loop line 69 extends in a direction from a heel side 60 of the
30 footwear article 60 to a toe side 58 of the footwear article. The loop line 69 also
   extends from a tibular side 62 of the footwear article 50 to a fibular side 64 of the
   footwear article.   The loop line 69 may peripherally extend around the footwear
   article, and in one example may traverse around the entire upper. Further it will be
   appreciated that the loop line 69 may extend in an arc around at least a portion of the
                                              5

   footwear article 50.     Other loop line configurations have been contemplated.        For
   instance, the loop line may extend across the footwear article from a first later side to
   a second lateral side. Further in another example, the loop line may extend around the
   footwear article in an arc, from a first side of a heel counter to a second side of a heel
 5 counter. Still further in another example, the loop line may laterally extend across the
   footwear article as well as extend in an arc around a front of the footwear article (e.g.,
   toe side). Even further in another example, the loop line may only extend around a
   portion of the footwear article, such as a portion adjacent to a toe side or a heel side of
   the footwear article. Further still in one example, the footwear article may include a
10 plurality of loop lines.
   [00281           The vamp substructure 78 is spaced away (e.g., vertically spaced
   away) from the sole 52, in the depicted example. Additionally, the rand substructure
   68 may be positioned vertically above the sole 52 and the vamp substructure 78 may
   be positioned vertically above the rand substructure. A vertical axis is provided for
15 reference. However, it will be appreciated that other footwear article orientations may
   be used if desired. It will be appreciated that the vamp substructure 78 may be spaced
   away from the sole 52 when the footwear article is not being worn.               The cord
   structure 66 may retain it shape due to the interconnection between the vamp
   substructure 78 and the rand substructure 68, along with the internal structure of the
20 cord. Example interconnections are discussed in further detail herein.
   [0029]           FIG. 3 shows a more detailed view of the at least partially sliding
   interconnection between the vamp attachment bights 74 and the rand attachment
   bights 76.    It will be appreciated that the vamp attachment bights 74 are shown
   interlocked with rand attachment bights, as depicted in FIG. 3. In this way, the vamp
25 substructure may be coupled to the rand substructure without the use of adhesive, if
   desired.   However, it will be appreciated that in some examples adhesives may be
   used to couple certain elements in the footwear article. In one example, the sliding
   connection between the bights may be free of knots. However in another example, at
   least a portion of the vamp attachment bights 74 may be fixedly coupled to at least a
30 portion of the rand attachment bights 76. In another example, stitched locks may be
   used to provide the partially sliding interconnection.      For instance, loose or tight
   stitched interfaces may be provided at the junctions of the cords in the upper.         By
   controlling the amount of slippable engagement in various sections of the footwear
                                                6

   article desired fitting characteristics may be achieved to increase the wearer's
   comfort.
   [00301          Returning to FIG. 1, the vamp substructure 78 further includes lace
   attachment bights 80. The lace attachment bights 80 are shown coupled to a lace cord
 5 82 in FIG. 1. Specifically, the lace cord 82 extends through the lace attachment bights
   80. The length of the lace cord 82 may be adjusted by the wearer. However, alternate
   lace cord configurations have been considered. For instance, the footwear article may
   be constructed without a lace cord. In this way, a wearer can quickly and easily slip
   on and off the footwear article without the need to tie a lace cord.        In such an
10 example, elastic material may be provided in the footwear article to enable controlled
   expansion and contraction of portions of the cord structure. Additionally, different
   lacing patterns have been considered. For instance, the cord structure may include
   eyestays. Cords in the cord structure may extend through the eyestays. Additionally,
   the eyestays may include eyelets and/or loops and are described in greater detail
15 herein with regard to FIG. 16.
   [00311          The lace cord 82 may be included in the cord structure 66, in some
   examples. However, in other examples the lace cord 82 may not be included in the
   cord structure 66. In such an example, elastic or other suitable material may be used
   to provide the footwear article with a slip-on capability.
20 [0032]          Numerous relative vamp cord, rand cord, and/or lace cord lengths have
   been contemplated. Portions of the rand cord 84 and the vamp cord 86 are also shown
   in FIG. 3. The sole attachment bights 70 are also shown in FIG. 3. A sole cord 72 is
   also shown in FIG. 3, the sole cord may be included in the cord structure 66 shown in
   FIG. 1. As illustrated, the sole cord 72 is intertwined with the sole attachment bights
25 70.
   [00331          It should be appreciated, that the construction method described herein
   enables, in some embodiments, options for customizing sizing and for adjusting sizing
   with minimal tooling expenditures. For example, the construction of the upper based
   on a cord length enables variation in size without changing the upper pattern or
30 obtaining different size cutting dies. As such, in some embodiments, the size of the
   upper can be altered by varying the cord length. The loops may remain in their
   relative position for each size. Such construction reduces costs by utilizing same size
   tooling.
                                               7

   [00341          Likewise, customization of the footwear may be applied to improve fit
   for a specific user. With generation of an electronic scan of a foot, a customized and
   personalized cord may be used to generate customized footwear based on the foot
   scan. For example, the lengthening (or shortening) of the loops, the positioning and
 5 sizing of the loop line, and the adjustment of cord size may be adjusted alone or in
   combination to tailor the upper to the specific dimensions of the scanned foot to
   provide a customized fit.
   [00351          Turning back to FIG. 1, the rand cord 84 and the vamp cord 86 are
   depicted as being round cords in FIG. 1.           However, other shapes have been
10 contemplated.    For instance, one or more of the cords may be flat cords or one or
   more of the cords may have flat ends and round midsections. In another example, one
   or more of the cords may have one or more flat sections and one or more round
   sections. For instance, a cord may include a round section followed by a flat section
   and so on and so forth.    Additionally, the sole cord 72 shown in FIG. 3 may be flat,
15 round, or have different sections with varying geometries. Additionally, the rand cord
   84, the vamp cord 86, and the lace cord 82 are all depicted as having a similar cross
   sectional area (e.g., diameter) and/or geometry. In one example, the diameter of one
   or more of the cords may be between 1/ 8 th of an inch and 1/16 th of an inch. However,
   in other examples the cords may have varying widths. It will be appreciated that the
20 sole cord 72 shown in FIG. 3 may have a similar geometry to the rand cord, vamp
   cord, and/or lace cord, in one example.       However, in other examples, the cross
   sectional area and/or geometry of the rand cord 84, the vamp cord 86, sole cords 72,
   and/or lace cord 82 may vary. For example, the cross-sectional area of the rand cord
   may be larger than the vamp cord. In another example, the rand cord may be circular
25 and the vamp cord may be flat.
   [00361          Further in some examples, the rand cord 84, vamp cord 86, and/or lace
   cord 82 may comprise similar material(s).            However, in other examples the
   aforementioned cords may comprise different materials.        One or more of the cords
   may comprise synthetic fibers such as Polypropylene, Nylon, Polyester, Polyethylene,
30 Aramid, and/or Acrylate polymer.        Additionally, one or more of the cords may
   comprise natural fibers such as cotton, linen, coir, etc. Further in one example, one or
   more of the cords may comprise a polymeric material.
   [00371          Additionally, the rand cord 84, vamp cord 86, and/or lace cord 82 may
   be designed with different material properties to enable the footwear article have
                                              8

   desired structural characteristics. For example, the lace cord 82 may have a greater
   elasticity than the rand cord 84 and/or the vamp cord 86.
   [00381           As shown in FIG. 1, the vertical height of the vamp attachment bights
   increases in a reward direction extending toward the heel side 60 of the footwear
 5 article 50. The width of the interlocked vamp cord sections extending from the lace
   cord to the rand cord may also increase in the reward direction extending toward the
   heel side 60 of the footwear article 50.
   [00391           The footwear article 50 also includes a heel counter 97.        The heel
   counter or other support structures in the footwear article may be included in the
10 upper discussed above. It will be appreciated that the rigidity/flexibility of the heel
   counter 97 may be selected to provide a desired amount of support to the cord
   structure 66. Specifically, the heel counter 97 may prevent the cord structure from
   flexing outward and/or downward in a direction toward the sole by an undesirable
   amount. In this way, the cord structure may maintain a desired shape. As a result, a
15 wearer of the footwear article may quickly and comfortably put on and take off the
   footwear article. The heel counter 97 may comprise a different material than the cord
   structure 66, such as leather, synthetic leather, fabric, etc.        However, in some
   examples the heat support structure may also comprise cord. The loop line 69 may
   extend through the heel counter 97 in some examples. Additionally, the heel counter
20 97 may be coupled to the sole 52. Specifically, in some examples the heel counter
   structure may extend (e.g., vertically or angularly) from the sole 52. The heel counter
   97 is coupled to the rand substructure 68, in the depicted example. A connection cord
   98 is shown extending through bights in the rand substructure 68 and through an
   opening 99 in the heel counter 97. In this way, the heel counter 97 provides support
25 to the cord structure as well as shields a portion of the cord structure from the external
   environment. Additionally or alternatively, the heel counter 97 may be coupled to the
   vamp substructure 78, thereby providing support to the substructure. The heel counter
   may have a greater rigidity than the cord structure 66. In one example, the connection
   cord 98 may be a portion of the vamp cord 86 or the rand cord 84. Additionally, a
30 portion of the cord structure extends around the width of the heel counter 97.
   However, other heel counter configurations have been contemplated. In one example,
   ends of cords in the cord structure may be coupled to the heel counter and/or coupled
   to one another within the heel counter. In one example, the heel counter 97 may have
   greater stiffness in a longitudinal direction than a lateral direction.      The vertical
                                               9

   stiffening of the support may provide a desired amount of support to the cord
   structure.    However, other heel counter 97 material characteristics have been
   contemplated.
   [0040]          The footwear article 50 shown in FIG.1 further includes an eyestay
 5 110. Cords in the cord structure 66 may extend through the eyestay 110. It will be
   appreciated that more than one cord section extends though the eyestay 110, in the
   depicted example. However in other examples, alternate eyestay designs have been
   contemplated. The eyestay 110 may provide desired cord spacing and cord support to
   the cord structure. In this way, the eyestay 110 may limit the free movement of the
10 cords extending therethrough. The eyestay 110 may be included in an upper structure
   112. In one example, the upper structure 112 may be adjacent to a tongue 114 of the
   footwear article. The upper structure may comprise a different material than the cord
   structure, in one example. Example eyestay materials include cloth, leather, synthetic
   leather, fabric, polymeric material, etc. In other examples, the footwear article may
15 include a plurality of eyestays.
   [0041]          Additionally in the example shown in FIG. 20, the footwear article 50
   may include a bootie 2000 at least partially enclosed by the cord structure 66. The
   bootie 2000 may be coupled to the cord structure 66, in some examples. However, in
   other examples the bootie 2000 may not be coupled to the cord structure 66. The
20 bootie 2000 may be in the shape of a sock, in one example. Additionally, the bootie
   may comprise a material such as neoprene, in one example.         The bootie provides
   increased insulation to the wearers foots and provides additional protection from the
   external environment.
   [0042]          Additionally, one or more sheaths may enclose (e.g., circumferentially
25 enclose) a portion of at least one of the rand cord 84 and vamp cord 86, in some
   examples. Therefore, the sheaths may surround various sections of the cords in the
   cord structure. For instance, a plurality of sheaths may surround a portion of the rand
   cord 84 from vamp attachment bights 74 to the rand attachment bights 76. Thus, the
   sheaths may act as protective covers for the cords. In some examples, the sheath may
30 be in face sharing contact with an outer surface of the cord.       However, in other
   examples, the sheath may be spaced away from an outer surface of the cord. The
   sheaths may be cylindrical, in one example. However, other sheath geometries have
   been contemplated. Additionally, a plurality of sheaths may be used to form a toe cap
   around the toe side of the footwear article.       The sheaths may provide increased
                                              10

   structural integrity to desired areas of the cord structure 66, to enable the cord
   structure 66 to retain a desired shape. The sheaths may comprise a different material
   than the vamp cord and/or the rand cord. In one example, the sheaths may comprise a
   polymeric material. The sheaths may also protect the cords from damage.
 5 [00431           FIG. 2 shows an exploded view of an example sole 52. As previously
   discussed the sole 52 is included in the footwear article 50 shown in FIG. 1. The sole
   52 includes a first portion 200, a second portion 202, and a third portion 204. In an
   assembled configuration the first and second portions (200 and 202) may be coupled
   (e.g.,  stitched, adhesively     bonded, snapped,     etc.)  to the third portion     204.
10 Additionally, in the assembled configuration surfaces in the first and second portions
   (200 and 202) may conform to contours (e.g., mate) with surfaces in the third portion
   204.    Thus, surfaces in the second and third portions may be in face sharing contact
   with surfaces in the first portion.
   [0044]           Additionally, the third section 204 includes a plurality of openings 206.
15 In one example, there may be 17 opening on each lateral side of the sole. In another
   example, there may be less than 26 openings on each lateral side of the sole. Still
   further in another example there may be less than 30 openings on each lateral side of
   the sole or between 15 and 30 openings on each lateral side of the sole. Sequential
   openings may spaced away from one another by 4 millimeters (mm) or greater. It will
20 be appreciated that the spacing and the sizing of the openings affect the structural
   characteristics of the sole. For instance, if the sole contains too many opening the
   integrity of the sole may be compromised. Therefore, the sole may have a maximum
   number of openings and/or a maximum opening separation, in one example. The size
   of the openings may be determined based on the size of the cords, the type of tooling
25 machines used in manufacturing, etc. In one example, the size of the cord (e.g., cord
   diameter or thickness) may directly correlate to the size of the holes. In the depicted
   example, a portion of the openings have a similar geometry and size. However, other
   opening geometries and sizing have been contemplated.           One or more cords in the
   cord structure may extend through the openings, as previously discussed.
30 [00451           Additionally, the number of eyestays in the cord structure, discussed in
   greater detail herein, may correlate (e.g., directly correlate) to the number of openings
   in the sole. Specifically in one example, the number of eyestays may be equivalent to
   the number of openings in the sole. Further in one example, a single cord may extend
   from the eyestays to the openings in the sole. For instance, the cord may extend
                                                11

   through an eyestay and then an opening in the sole and so on and so forth. However,
   other cord configurations have been contemplated. For instance, different cords may
   extend through the eyestays and the attachment openings in the sole.           Further in
   another example, one cord may extend through a portion of the eyestays and the
 5 openings and a second cord may extend through the remaining eyestays and a third
   cord may extend through the remaining openings.
   [00461          Continuing with FIG. 2, a sole cord and/or other cord included in the
   cord structure of the footwear article may be positioned between the first portion 200
   and the third portion 204 and/or the second portion 202 and the third portion 204. In
10 this way, the cord is protected from the external environment which may transfer dirt,
   rocks, and/or other particulates to the cords. Consequently, wear to the cord structure
   is reduced, thereby increasing the footwear article's longevity. However, in other
   examples at least a portion of the cord structure may be exposed to the external
   environment.    Constructing the sole in multiple pieces may also simplify footwear
15 article assembly, thereby reducing manufacturing costs. Additionally, the sole cord
   72, shown in FIG. 3, may be positioned in a recess 208 extending around a periphery
   of the sole.    However, other sole cord positions have been contemplated.            For
   instance, the sole cord may extend across the sole from a first lateral side to a second
   lateral side one or more times. Furthermore, the unassembled sole cord may include a
20 first end and a second end. It will be appreciated that the ends of the sole cord may be
   attached to one another or other components in the footwear article, when assembled.
   Additionally, the sole cord may comprise a polymeric material.
   [00471          Sole attachment bights included in the cord structure 66 shown in FIG.
   1 may attach to the sole cord positioned in the recess 208 shown in FIG. 2. The sole
25 attachment bights may be positioned in each of the openings 206.                The rand
   attachment bights shown in FIG. 1 may be coupled (e.g., interconnected, interlocked,
   etc.) with the sole attachment bights. In this way, the sole cord may be coupled to the
   rand cord without the use of adhesives, if desired.
   [00481          FIGS. 4-9 show various views of a second example footwear article
30 50. Specifically FIG. 4 shows a bottom view of the second example footwear article
   50. As illustrated, the sole cord 72 traverses a bottom surface of the sole 52.
   Specifically, the sole cord 72 follows a peripheral path around the sole 52. Thus, the
   sole cord 72 shown in FIG. 4 does not laterally traverse the sole a plurality of times,
   as shown in FIG. 2. However, other sole cord positions have been contemplated. For
                                              12

   instance, the sole cord may extend around a periphery of the sole in a first section and
   traverse the sole in a second section. Further in the depicted example, each of the sole
   attachment bights 70 extends through a single opening 400 in the sole. However,
   other sole attachment bight configurations have been contemplated. The opening may
 5 be included in the plurality of attachment openings 54, discussed above with regard to
   FIG. 1.
   [0049]          FIG. 5 shows a top view of the second example footwear article 50
   including the cord structure 66. Portions of the vamp substructure 78, such as the lace
   attachment bights 80, are grouped together via string 500 and/or other suitable
10 attachment techniques. Grouping lace attachment bights 80 enables a different lacing
   pattern to be used in the footwear article 50 and the rand substructure 68.          The
   grouped cords may be selectively chosen based on desired end use characteristics. In
   one example, sections of the cords may be grouped while other sections may be
   decoupled from one another.         It will be appreciated that in FIG. 5 the rand
15 substructure 68 is coupled to the vamp substructure 78 in a similar manner to the
   coupling technique shown in FIG. 1. A foot mannequin 1667 and lace cord 82 are
   also shown in FIG. 5.      As illustrated, the lace cord 82 extends through the lace
   attachment bights 80.
   [00501          FIG. 6 shows a rear view of the second example footwear article 50.
20 The sole 52, rand substructure 68, and vamp substructure 78 are shown in FIG. 6.
   The rand cord 84 and the vamp cord 86 are also shown in FIG. 6. The rand cord 84
   and the vamp cord 86 are attached via tape 600. However, other suitable coupling
   techniques have been contemplated. For example, the rand cord 84 and vamp cord 86
   may be stitched together, attached via snaps, clips, etc.       In some examples, the
25 location of the attachment point between the rand cord 84 and the vamp cord 86 may
   be adjustable, enabling the footwear article to be customized by the wearer. The ends
   of the cords in the rand substructure and/or vamp substructure may be attached near
   the heel side of the footwear article.       The ends may be stitched, glued (e.g.,
   cemented), tied, and/or taped together. Additionally or alternatively, a portion of the
30 rand substructure and/or the vamp substructure may be at least partially enclosed via a
   protective sleeve. In such an example, the ends of the cords in the substructures may
   be glued, stitched, tied, and/or taped together in the protective sleeve and/or coupled
   to a portion of the protective sleeve. In this way, the ends of the cords are not in
   direct contact with a wearer's foot which may improve the footwear's comfort.
                                              13

   [00511         FIG. 7 shows a front view of the second example footwear article 50
   including the cord structure 66. The sole 52, sole cord 72, rand substructure 68, vamp
   substructure 78, and the lace cord 82. It will be appreciated that the rand substructure
   68 is coupled to the vamp substructure 78 in a similar manner to the first example
 5 footwear article shown in FIG. 1.       The rand attachment bights 76 in the vamp
   substructure are interconnected with the vamp attachment bights 74 in the rand
   substructure to form an attachment interface in the second example footwear article
   50, shown in FIG. 7.      The sole attachment bights 70 are again shown extending
   through the sole 52. However, other sole attachment bight configurations have been
10 contemplated.
   [0052]         FIG. 8 shows a first side view of the second example footwear article
   50 including the cord structure 66. The sole 52, sole cord 72, rand substructure 68,
   and vamp substructure 78 are also depicted in FIG. 8.       The sole cord 72 is shown
   extending through sole attachment bights 70. As shown, the rand attachment bights
15 76 in the vamp substructure are interconnected with the vamp attachment bights 74.
   [00531         FIG. 9 shows a second side view of the second example footwear
   article 50 including the cord structure 66. Again, the sole 52, sole cord 72, rand
   substructure 68, and vamp substructure 78 are also shown. The sole cord 72 is also
   shown extending through sole attachment bights 70.            As illustrated, the rand
20 attachment bights 76 in the vamp substructure are interconnected with the vamp
   attachment bights 74.
   [0054]         FIGS. 10-15 show various views of a third example footwear article
   50. Specifically, FIG. 10 shows a bottom view of the third example footwear article
   50.   The sole 52 and sole attachment bights 70 are shown in FIG. 10.         It will be
25 appreciated that the sole cord has been omitted from the example footwear article
   shown in FIG. 10. Thus, each sole of the sole attachment bights 70 extends through
   two openings 1000 in the sole 52. In one example, the sole attachment bights 70 may
   be stitched and/or glued to the sole. In this way, a greater amount of attachment
   strength may be provided between the attachment bights and the sole, decreasing
30 slippable engagement.     In one example, the cord may be engaged with the sole,
   including locked, partially-locked, slippably engaged, or limited slippably engaged).
   [00551         FIG. 11 shows a top view of the third example footwear article 50
   including the cord structure 66. The sole 52, rand substructure 68, vamp substructure
   78, lace cord 82, and heel counter 97, are shown in FIG. 11. A string 1100 or other
                                              14

   suitable cord may be interlaced through the vamp substructure 78 to provide
   additional support to the structure. As illustrated, the rand attachment bights 76 in the
   vamp substructure are interconnected with the vamp attachment bights 74. It will be
   appreciated that in the third example footwear article 50 the rand substructure 68 is
 5 coupled to the vamp substructure 78 in a similar manner to the first and second
   example footwear articles, discussed above. However, other coupling techniques
   have been contemplated.
   [0056]          FIGS. 12 and 13 show different side views of the third example
   footwear article 50 including the cord structure 66. The sole 52, rand substructure 68,
10 vamp substructure 78, heel counter 97, and lace cord 82 are also shown in FIGS. 12
   and 13. As illustrated, the rand attachment bights 76 in the vamp substructure are
   interconnected with the vamp attachment bights 74 and the rand substructure. It will
   be appreciated that each of the sole attachment bights 70 includes a first portion
   extending through a first opening in the sole 52 and a second portion extending
15 through a second opening in the sole 52. In this way, the sole cord may be omitted, if
   desired.
   [00571          FIG. 14 shows a front view of the third example footwear article 50
   including the cord structure 66. The sole 52, rand substructure 68, vamp substructure
   78, heel counter 97, and lace cord 82 are also shown in FIG. 14. As illustrated, the
20 rand attachment bights 76 in the vamp substructure are interconnected with the vamp
   attachment bights 74.
   [0058]          FIG. 15 shows a rear view of the footwear article 50. The heel counter
   97 and sole 52 are shown in FIG. 15.         The heel counter 97 provides support and
   retention to a person's heel.     In this way, the comfort of the footwear article is
25 increased. Parts of selected cords in the cord structure 66 may extend through the
   heel counter 97. Additionally or alternatively, the parts of the selected cords may be
   coupled to the heel counter.
   [00591          FIG. 16 shows another example footwear article 50. The footwear
   article shown in FIG. 16 includes the cord structure 66 and sole 52. As discussed
30 above the cord structure 66 is included in the upper 67.           The cord structure 66
   includes the rand substructure 68 and the vamp substructure 78.               The vamp
   substructure 78 includes rand attachment bights 76 and the rand substructure 68
   includes vamp attachment bights 74.       The loop line 69 is also depicted in FIG. 16.
   The lace cord 82, rand cord 84, sole cord 72, and vamp cord 86 are also shown in
                                               15

   FIG. 16. Additionally, the heel counter 97, connection cord 98, and openings 99 are
   shown in FIG. 16.
   [00601          The footwear article 50 may further include an outsole 1653.            The
   outsole 1653 may be coupled to the sole 52. For instance, the outsole 1653 may be
 5 stitched or otherwise attached to the insole/midsole 52. However, in other examples
   the outsole may not be included in the footwear article or the outsole may be
   integrated into the sole. A foot mannequin 1667 is depicted for reference in FIG. 16.
   [00611          In the example depicted in FIG. 16 the rand substructure 68 includes
   only a single rand cord 84, and the vamp substructure 78 includes a single vamp cord
10 86. However, more than one cord or cord section may be used to form the rand
   substructure or the vamp substructure, in other examples.           A rand cord prior to
   construction of the cord structure 66 is shown at 1688. The unassembled rand cord
   includes a first end 1689 and a second end 1690. It will be appreciated that the ends
   of the rand cord may be attached to one another or other components in the footwear
15 article when assembled. A vamp cord prior to construction of the cord structure is
   shown at 1691. The unassembled vamp cord includes a first end 1692 and a second
   end 1693. It will be appreciated that the ends of the vamp cord may be attached to
   one another or other components in the footwear article when assembled. A lace cord
   prior to construction of the cord structure 66 is show at 1694. The lace cord includes
20 a first end 1695 and a second end 1696.
   [0062]          The sole 52 includes attachment openings 1654.             In the depicted
   example, the attachment openings 1654 are gaps positioned around a periphery 1656
   of the sole 52. However, in other examples, the attachment openings 1654 may be
   apertures offset or otherwise spaced away from the periphery of the sole 52.            The
25 attachment openings 1654 extend from the toe side 58 of the footwear article 50 to the
   heel side 60 of the footwear article. The attachment openings 54 also extend from the
   tibular side 62 of the footwear article 50 to the fibular side 64 of the footwear article.
   [00631          Sole attachment bights 1670 may extend through the attachment
   openings 1654. Specifically, in one example, the sole attachment bights 1670 may
30 extend from a top side of the sole 52 to a bottom side of the sole. However, other sole
   attachment bights positions have been contemplated.          The bights may be used for
   attachment and coupling between components in the footwear article 50. The sole
   cord 72 may extend through the sole attachment bights1670.               Specifically, rand
   attachment bights 1673 in the sole cord 72 may be coupled (e.g., interconnected,
                                               16

   interlocked, intertwined, pulled through, pushed through, or punched through) to the
   sole attachment bights 1670.     Specifically in one example, the sole cord 72 may be
   fixed on attachment bights 1673. However in another example, the attachment bights
   1673 in the sole cord 72 may not be coupled to the sole attachment bights 1670. The
 5 sole cord 72 and the attachment between the rand attachment bights 1670 in the sole
   cord 72 and the sole attachment bights 1670 in the rand cord are discussed in greater
   detail herein with regard to FIG. 2.
   [0064]          FIG. 17 shows another example footwear article 50.         The footwear
   article 50 shown in FIG. 17 includes a toe cap 1700 coupled to the cord structure 66.
10 The toe cap may be generally referred to as a support structure. In one example, the
   toe cap 1700 may enclose a portion of the cord structure 66.          However, in other
   examples the cord structure 66 may be coupled to peripheral portions of the toe cap
   1700. Thus in such an example, the toe cap interrupts the cord structure 66 and divide
   it into multiple distinct sections.   The toe cap 1700 may be constructed out of a
15 material having less flexibility than the cord structure, in one example.      However,
   other toe cap characteristics have been contemplated. The footwear article 50 shown
   in FIG. 17 further includes a heel counter 1702. As shown, the heel counter 1702
   extends along a length of the article towards a front end of the article. Additionally in
   the depicted example, the heel counter 1702 is positioned away from the toe cap 1700.
20 However in other example, the heel counter and toe cap may be positioned adjacent to
   one another.
   [00651          FIG. 18 shows another example footwear article 50.            A support
   structure 1800 is shown included in the footwear article 50 in FIG. 18. The support
   structure 1800 extends around the heel and down the article towards the front of the
25 article. The support structure 1800 further includes a portion extending from a top of
   the article toward the sole 52.    The support structure 1800 shown in FIG. 18 is a
   continuous piece of material. However, it will be appreciated that the footwear article
   may include a plurality of support structures spaced away from one another, as shown
   in FIG. 17. In such an example each of the support structure may be formed from a
30 separate continuous piece of material. The support structure 1800 includes a control
   strip 1802 and a heel section 1804. The control strip and the heel section provide
   controlled support to the structure 66. In this way, support may be provided to the
   cord structure 66 at desired locations.
                                              17

   [00661           FIG. 19 shows another example footwear article 50.             The cord
   structure 66 of the footwear article is illustrated. The cord structure 66 shown in FIG.
   19 includes a first section 1900 and a second section 1902 spaced away from one
   another. The first section 1900 includes two or more cords and the second section
 5 1902 includes two or more cords different from the cords in the first section.
   [00671           The slippable engagement between cords in the sections of the cord
   structure 66 may vary between the sections. For instance, the cords in the second
   section 1902 may be partially-securely engaged at selected points and the cords in the
   first section 1900 may be slippably engaged at selected points or vice-versa. In this
10 way, the cord structure may have varying degrees of compliance in different sections.
   As shown, the sections are longitudinally divided.           However, alternate section
   boundaries have been contemplated. For instance, a first section may extend around
   an upper portion of the footwear article and a lower section may extend around a
   lower portion of the footwear article adjacent to the sole. It will be appreciated that
15 the boundaries of the sections may be selected based on desired end use
   characteristics.   In other examples, the cord structure may be divided into three or
   more sections. The variation in the degree of engagement between the cord structure
   sections enables desired regions of the footwear article to have greater degrees of
   movement than other regions of the footwear article. Thus, fitting characteristics of
20 the footwear article may be selected for specified regions of the footwear article. As a
   result, fitting and comfort of the footwear article is improved.       Further in another
   example, cords in the cord structure may only be intertwined in selected regions of the
   footwear article. For instance, a heel portion and a toe portion of the footwear article
   may not include intertwined cords and a section between the heel and toe portion may
25 have intertwined cords.
   [00681           FIG. 20 shows another example footwear article 50. As previously
   discussed, the footwear article includes the bootie 2000 which is at least partially
   enclosed by the cord structure 66.      As discussed above, the cord structure may be
   attached to the bootie in one example. Additionally or alternatively, the bootie 2000
30 may be attached to the sole 52. The bootie may be attached to the heel counter 97, in
   one example. However in other example, the bootie 2000 may not be attached to the
   heel counter 97. The sole 52 is also depicted in FIG. 20. It will be appreciated that the

   [00691           FIG. 21 shows a top view of the example footwear article 50 shown in
   FIG. 20. Again the bootie 2000 is depicted. The bootie 2000 is enclosed via the cord
   structure 66.     In one example, the bootie 2000 may be attached (e.g., stitched,
   adhesively coupled, etc.) to portions of the cord structure 66.      However in other
 5 example the bootie 2000 may not be attached to the cord structure 66. Additionally,
   the heel counter 97 is also depicted in FIG. 21. The heel counter 97 is coupled to the
   cord structure 66.
   [0070]           FIG. 22 shows a section of an example sole 52. The sole includes an
   opening 2200. The opening may be configured to receive a section 2202 of a cord
10 included in the cord structure discussed above, that snaps into the opening 2200 as
   opposed to passing through the opening as shown in previous examples.         Thus, the
   opening 2200 may retain the cord via an elastic force. It will be appreciated that a
   plurality of this type of "snap attachment" openings may be included in the sole 52.
   [00711           FIG. 23 shows another example sole 52. The sole 52 includes a core
15 section 2300 and an outer ring section 2302. The core section 2300 includes openings
   2304. It will be appreciated that cords may be threaded through the openings 2304
   during construction of the footwear article.   Furthermore, the outer ring section 2302
   may peripherally extend around the core section 2300. In some examples, the sole 52
   may include a plurality of outer ring sections. However, in other examples, the sole
20 may include a single outer ring section peripherally extending around the entire core
   section. The outer ring section 2302 and the core section 2300 may be adhesively
   bonded, sewn, or otherwise suitably attached to the core section 2300.
   [0072]           FIG. 24 shows another example sole 52. The sole includes a pin 2400
   located in an opening 2401 on the sole 52. A cord 2402 included in the cord structure
25 may extend around the pin. In this example, the cord passes through the opening
   2401 twice.     In this way, the cord may be attached to the sole through a single
   opening with limited slip. It will be appreciated that in one example pins may be
   included in a plurality of openings in the sole. Further in another example, a portion
   of the openings in the sole may include pins and another portion of the opening may
30 not include pins.
   [0073]           It will be appreciated that the configurations and/or approaches
   described herein are exemplary in nature, and that these specific embodiments or
   examples are not to be considered in a limiting sense, because numerous variations
   are possible.    The subject matter of the present disclosure includes all novel and
