                              Steel tower for a wind turbine and a method for producing the tower
   The invention relates to steel towers for wind turbines, including a plurality of tower sections
 5 arranged one above another and joined together, of which at least one tower section consists of
   section segments. The invention likewise relates to a method for producing steel towers of this kind.
   With the increasing demand for wind turbines of higher power and thus larger dimensions of the
   main components, such as tower, nacelle, and rotor blades, the permissible limits for vehicle
10 dimensions have been reached, especially the maximum height of 4 meters. The boundaries dictated
   by the logistical infrastructure, such as clear height under bridges, also make it necessary to divide
   tower sections with more than roughly 4 meters diameter into several pieces.
   The utility model DE 203 21 855 Ul describes a steel tower for a wind turbine including a number
15 of cylindrical or conical tower sections, where at least its broader sections are subdivided into two
   or more elongated shell segments which are combined into a complete tower section via vertical
   flanges, which are fastened to each other by a plurality of bolts, the shells also being provided with
   upper and lower horizontal flanges in order to allow the tower sections to be connected to each
   other.
20
   Patent application DE 10 2007 018 025 Al shows a wind turbine tower with a load-bearing outer
   tower wall, having an encircling, outer boundary surface and consisting of a plurality of wall
   sections, each of which has a middle section and two edge sections running in the longitudinal
   direction of the tower, being provided with a plurality of connection boreholes, while the surfaces
25 defined by the edge sections run along the outer boundary surface or at a constant distance from it,
   and the connection boreholes are oriented transversely to the outer boundary surface.
   From DE 10 2010 039 796 Al there is known a tower with an adapter piece as well as a method of
   making a tower, wherein a lower tubular tower section of concrete and an upper tubular tower
30 section of steel are provided. Such hybrid towers are preferred at present for the erecting of
   especially tall wind turbine towers, since large diameters are possible with the lower concrete
   structure and conventional wind turbine towers can be set atop the lower tower structure in order to
   achieve greater heights and thus better wind utilization.

   From WO 2015/161858 Al there is known a method for making a tower section for the tower of a
   wind turbine in which the tower section is subdivided into section segments in the tower lengthwise
   direction. The section segments are at first created by severing the tower wall and afterwards joined
 5 to each other once more with the aid of flanges.
   The problem which the invention proposes to solve is to provide a steel tower for a wind turbine as
   well as a method for producing same, making it possible to precisely produce the steel tower from
   segmented tower sections with simple means.
10
   According to the invention, this problem is solved by a steel tower with the features of claim 1 and
   a production method with the features of claim 8. Advantageous embodiments are the subject
   matter of the dependent claims.
15 The steel tower according to the invention for a wind turbine includes a plurality of cylindrical
   and/or conical tower sections which are joined together via horizontal annular flanges, at least one
   tower section having at least two section pieces, which are welded together along their horizontal
   annular end faces and are welded to horizontal annular flanges along the free uppermost and
   lowermost end face. At least one tower section is divided into a plurality of elongate section
20 segments, preferably into three section segments, which are joined to one another via vertical
   longitudinal profiles and connecting means, preferably screw connections, to form a complete tower
   section. The annular flanges are divided at predetermined positions into at least two, preferably into
   three annular flange segments; for this purpose, separation sections are provided at the
   predetermined position. The annular flanges are separated at the separation sections into annular
25 flange segments together with the tower section being separated into section segments. The
   separation section is distinguished by having a lower material thickness than the rest of the annular
   flange. The problem on which the invention is based is solved in that at least one tower section is
   divided into a plurality of section segments, in the same manner as the annular flange, wherein the
   annular flange is separated in the region of its separation sections. However, the tower sections are
30 not limited here to two or three section segments or annular flange segments; on the contrary, tower
   sections which have four or more section segments and annular flange segments are also included.

                                                     -3
   According to the invention, the problem is also solved by a method as claimed in claim 8. The
   method according to the invention serves for producing a steel tower for a wind turbine, beginning
   with the step of producing a first tower section. Steel sheet is bent substantially annularly and
   welded along a longitudinal edge to form a closed section piece A plurality of section pieces, which
 5 are annular in cross-section, is welded along adjoining annular end faces, which run in the
   circumferential direction and are adjacent, to form a longitudinally extending tubular body,
   wherein, in order to form a tower section, a closed annular flange is in each case welded to the ring
   shaped end faces of the tubular body and/or to a ring-shaped end face of a section part in a
   predetermined position with respect to the circumferential direction. At predetermined positions, the
10 annular flange has a reduced cross section as the separating section, and the predetermined positions
   coincide with planned separation lines of the section segments or are aligned therewith. The
   separation section is arranged on the separation line.
   In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, each section segment of a tower section includes
15 one annular flange segment at the upper end face and at the lower end face, the arc length of the
   lower annular flange segment preferably being the same as, greater than or less than the arc length
   of the upper annular flange segment.
   In an advantageous development of the invention, at least one annular flange is designed as a T
20 annular flange which includes a ring-shaped flange portion which has a multiplicity of through
   holes which are arranged on both sides of a central web of the T-annular flange in at least two
   concentric circles of holes. At at least two, preferably three, predetermined positions, the cross
   section of the not yet divided T-annular flange is reduced by two slots in each case in order to form
   the separation sections in the undivided state of the annular flange.
25
   In a particularly preferred refinement, a first slot extends radially inward from the outer
   circumference of the ring-shaped flange portion and a second slot extends radially outward from the
   inner circumference of the ring-shaped flange portion, and therefore only a narrow, but sufficiently
   stiff segment connection as an extension of the web remains as the separation section.
30
   In an advantageous development of the invention, at least one annular flange is designed as an
   L-annular flange which includes a ring-shaped, horizontal flange portion which has a multiplicity of
   9826431_1(GHMattes) P107484.AU

                                                      -4
   through holes which lie on a circle of holes, and a ring-shaped vertical flange portion, wherein, at at
   least two, preferably three, predetermined positions the cross section of the ring-shaped horizontal
   flange portion is reduced in the not yet divided state via a respective slot as a separation section.
   The horizontal flange portion can also be considered to be a web.
 5
   A preferred arrangement for the connecting of a first kind of longitudinal profile, especially in the
   form of a U, C, or cap profile, to the tubular wall of the tower section is accomplished in that the
   longitudinal profiles are welded on with a web facing the inner wall of a tower section. The number
10 of parallel longitudinal profiles in a horizontal plane is equal to the number of section segments of a
   tower section.
   When a C profile open toward the inside of the tower is used according to the invention, in which
   two inwardly curved right-angled prolongations of the legs are facing each other and whose spacing
15 basically corresponds to the width of the slot in the web, one has the further advantage that no
   spacing elements are needed, during a later installation of the section segments, since the mentioned
   prolongations are drawn toward each other via screw connections and thus perform the function of
   the spacing elements, thereby producing an advantageous reduction in the installation time at the
   installation site.
20
   A preferred arrangement for the connecting of a second kind of longitudinal profile, especially in
   the form of H, I, or double T profiles, but also U, C, or cap profiles, to the tubular wall of the tower
   section, is accomplished in that the longitudinal profiles are welded on with their web facing the
   inner wall of a tower section. When using a longitudinal profile open toward the inside of the tower,
25 in which the web is at a distance from the inner wall of a tower section, or from an H profile, the
   width of the slot in the web can advantageously be chosen such that no spacing elements are needed
   during a later installation of the section segments, since the end faces of the web are drawn toward
   each other and thus perform the function of the spacing elements, thereby producing an
   advantageous reduction in the installation time at the construction site.

                                                      -5
   It has been found to be advantageous for the length of the longitudinal profiles, relative to the
   longitudinal direction of the tower, in a section piece to be greater than the length of the section
   piece, as this bridges the horizontal welds for connecting the section pieces.
 5 The tubular steel tower according to the invention affords time savings and economic savings for
   towers with a large diameter, and in addition wind turbines with the tubular steel towers according
   to the invention are available quickly for energy production. One further time-saving aspect when
   using section segments is that these can advisedly be provided with built-in elements, especially
   ones extending longitudinally, for example components for an access system, conductor sections
10 and/or cable holding devices and/or busbars, before the section segments are transported to the
   installation site. A further benefit of the section segments is that these can be more easily surface
   coated and/or varnished, especially with smaller coating installations, before being transported to
   the installation site.
15 In a development of the method according to the invention, a longitudinal profile is welded on the
   tubular body or the tower section in each case along the planned separation line onto the inside of
   the tubular wall. During the severing of the tower section and of the annular flange/annular flanges,
   the longitudinal profile is severed at the same time and subsequently forms two legs, via which the
   severed section segments are joined to each other again. When connecting the section segments a
20 spacer can be arranged between the legs. The longitudinal profile is welded onto the tower wall in
   such a manner that, after the severing, each leg is connected to its section segment.
   In the method according to the invention, the tubular body is placed, via a hoist or an industrial
   truck, above at least one movable cutting device and set down on supporting means of a supporting
25 device such that the first planned separation line is in the 6 o'clock position, i.e., facing downward.
   According to the 6 and 12 o'clock positions on a watch dial, the 6 o'clock position denotes the
   lowest and the 12 o'clock position the highest position of the tubular body lying on the supporting
   means.
30 In one especially preferred procedure of the method, in a following step the annular flanges of the
   tower section are connected, in particular bolted, at the end face to a receiving wheel, the receiving
   wheels preferably being arranged in a rotatable manner on a supporting device in order to be rotated
   9826431_1(GHMattes) P107484.AU

                                                      -6
   into a desired position. The tower section of the tubular body can be rotated in an especially gentle
   manner via the receiving wheels and the supporting device, i.e., without leaving marks by rollers on
   the outer sheath of the tower wall, such as might occur with the use of roller beds.
 5 In another especially preferred procedure of the method, the tubular body previously or
   subsequently the complete tower section is deposited via a hoist or an industrial truck onto the
   supporting device which has beams arranged parallel and spaced apart from one another, wherein
   the tubular body and/or the tower section is positioned in such a manner that a first planned
   separation line in the six o'clock position runs substantially centrally between the parallel and
10 spaced-apart beams of the supporting device.
   With another preferred following step of the method according to the invention, at least one
   movable cutting device with a cutting tool is moved into a starting position near a first annular
   flange and then in a further step the cutting tool, especially a side milling cutter or a saw blade,
15 under rotation, is brought into engagement via a vertically movable tool holder with the first annular
   flange at the first predetermined position.
   In one especially preferred procedure of the method, with a following step the first annular flange is
   severed using the cutting tool at the first predetermined position with reduced cross section and in a
20 directly subsequent step the cutting tool is moved continuously along the first separation line
   through the tubular wall as well as the longitudinal profile connected to the tubular wall, wherein,
   preferably, on account of the chosen direction of rotation of the cutting tool, the resulting shavings
   are taken away downward. In a continuation of the movement, the cutting tool is further moved
   along the first axial separation line through the tubular wall as well as the longitudinal profile
25 connected to it and the second annular flange at the other end of the tower section. After this, the
   cutting tool is moved back to the starting position, wherein preferably no engagement takes place.
   With the method according to the invention it is possible to automatically perform the cutting
   process over the entire length of the tower section, especially without a manual repositioning of a
   cutting device.
30
   After producing the first lengthwise cut, the above-described steps are repeated in accordance with
   the number of lengthwise cuts planned, wherein between each two cuts rotation of the tower section

                                                             -7
   about its longitudinal axis, e.g. by 120', is performed, preferably via the rotatable receiving wheels
   on the supporting device, so that the next planned separation line is positioned again the 6 o'clock
   position.
 5 When the required cuts are finally made, the cut section segments are held together by the receiving
   wheels arranged on the end sides. This is followed by releasing of the section segment from the
   receiving wheels, lifting of the section segment and setting it down on means of transport, hauling
   away of the section segment, preferably to a following processing installation, especially a coating
   and/or varnishing installation.

10 Fig. 1 shows a wind turbine 1 with a tower, which is constructed as a tubular steel tower 2 from a
   number of equal and different tower sections 7, 8, 9, wherein the lowermost tower section 7 is
   shown in detail in Fig. 2. The tubular steel tower 2 carries a nacelle 4 which is mounted so as to be
   able to rotate about a vertical longitudinal axis of the tower. In the nacelle 4 is mounted a drive train
   (not shown) with a main shaft, a gearing, and a generator. The main shaft stands in operative
15 connection with a rotor hub 5, on which three rotor blades 6 are mounted so as to be able to rotate
   about their longitudinal axis. The tubular steel tower 2 besides the lowermost tower section 7
   includes further tower sections 8, 9, where the lower tower sections 7, 8, i.e., those with larger
   diameter, consist of detachably joined section segments 18, while the upper tower sections 9, i.e.,
   those with smaller diameter, are configured as monolithic sections in the circumferential direction.
20
   Fig. 2 shows the lower tower section 7 with the tower entrance door opening 10. The prefabricated
   tower section 7 includes a number of section pieces 28, also known as "rounds" or "cans" among
   experts. The section pieces 28 generally have a lengthwise welded seam due to the manufacturing
   process. Other tower sections 8, without tower entrance door opening 10, are constructed
25 accordingly, the number of section pieces 28 possibly varying. In the sample embodiment shown,
   the tower section 7 has in total nine section pieces 28, which are welded to each other at their end
   faces. The free end faces of the outermost section pieces 28 of a section are each welded to an
   annular flange 12. In an advantageous modification, not shown, the annular flanges 12 are each
   welded beforehand to a perpendicularly disposed section piece 28 before this is welded to the other
30 section pieces 28. It is known to weld individual annular flange segments, instead of closed annular
   flanges, to the free end faces of the outermost section pieces of a tower section, although this
   requires an additional effort for the orientation work.

                                                     -9
   As can furthermore be noticed in Figure 2, the individual section pieces 28 can be rotated relative to
   each other about their lengthwise axis such that their longitudinal welded seams are always offset
   from each other by an offset angle so that the longitudinal welded seams of neighboring section
   pieces 28 do not lie flush in the same line. The sum of the offset angles is preferably 360' or a
 5 whole multiple thereof. Fig. 2 moreover shows a first longitudinal profile 13 roughly in the 5
   o'clock position, which extends on the inside of the wall of the tower section 7 parallel to its center
   axis and is welded to the wall. Besides the longitudinal profile 13 shown, the tower section 7 has
   two more longitudinal profiles 13, not visible from the outside, each arranged at a 120' offset in the
   tubular wall. In a following fabrication step, the tower section 7 is divided along a first, second and
10 third planned separation line 19 into three section segments 18, the planned separation lines 19 each
   coinciding with the longitudinal profiles 13. In other words, the respective lengthwise cutting
   occurs through the longitudinal profile 13, so that the section segments can afterwards be joined
   together once more by the longitudinal profile.
15 Fig. 3a, 3b, 3c show one possible longitudinal profile 13 in the form of a U profile 33, having
   equally long, plane parallel legs 33a, 33b and a web 33c joining the legs together, in three
   consecutive fabrication steps. The U profile 33 at first is welded by its web 33c on either side by the
   welded seams 34a and 34b to the as yet undivided tubular wall 38, only one cutout of the tubular
   wall 38 being shown. The web 33c furthermore has on the side facing the tubular wall 38 a fillet 35,
20 which has two purposes: first of all, an advantageous cross section and thus material reduction is
   achieved for a following lengthwise cutting, wherein a first slot 36 is created in the tubular wall 38
   of the tower section 7, 8 and a second slot 32 in the web 33c of the U profile 33, cf. Fig. 3b. The
   slots 36 and 32 are preferably produced in a common separation process. Each of the slots 32, 36
   after the severing has a pair of mutually facing separation sections in which the separation occurred.
25 Secondly, a fillet is created on either side of the slot edge for a further welded seam 34c, 34d on
   each side. In the course of the installation at the construction site, the section segments 18 are
   finally connected securely via connection means 39, especially consisting of threaded bolts 39a,
   which are passed through through holes 31 in the legs 33a, 33b of the severed longitudinal profile,
   and nuts 39c. Spacing elements 37 ensure a predetermined spacing and the slot widths 32, 36, as
30 shown by Fig. 3c. Thus, a desired slot width 32, 36 can be advantageously adjusted with the length
   of the spacing elements 37.

   Fig. 4a, 4b, 4c show another arrangement of longitudinal profile 13 and tubular wall 38. The
   longitudinal profile 13 here is fashioned in the form of a H profile 43, having equally long and
   plane parallel legs 43a, 43b and a web 43c. The H profile 43 is at first welded by its legs 43a, 43b
   on either side by the welded seams 44a and 44b to the as yet undivided tubular wall 38. Fig. 4b
 5 shows the arrangement consisting of the longitudinal profile 13 and the tubular wall 38 after a
   lengthwise cut has been made, wherein a first slot 36 was created in the tubular wall 38 of the tower
   section 7, 8 and a second slot 46 in the web 43c of the H profile 43. Fig. 4c finally shows the
   threaded bolts 39a, nuts 39c and spacing elements 37 led through through holes 40 of the legs 43a,
   43b in the course of the installation at the construction site and the thus securely connected section
10 segments 18, once again only showing a cutout of the tubular wall 38.
   Fig. 5 shows a longitudinal profile 13 in the form of another U profile 53, but one which has been
   rotated about its longitudinal axis by 180' as compared to the arrangement in Fig. 3a, 3b, 3c. The U
   profile 53 contrary to the sample embodiment of Fig. 3a, 3b, 3c has been welded by the legs 53a,
15 53b via the welded seams 54a and 54b to the as yet undivided tubular wall 38. The further
   fabrication steps are essentially as represented and described in Fig. 4b and 4c.
   Another advantageous arrangement, not shown, has in place of a U profile 33 per Fig. 3a, 3b, 3c a C
   profile open on top. The C profile by contrast with the U profile 33 has two inwardly curved right
20 angle prolongations of the legs, the open end surfaces of these prolongations facing each other and
   their spacing corresponding substantially to the width of the slot in the web. The C profile has the
   further advantage that the spacing elements 37 are not needed during a later installation of the
   section segments 18, since the mentioned prolongations are drawn toward each other and thus take
   on the function of the spacing elements 37, achieving an advantageous reduction in the installation
25 time.
   Besides the above profiles of Fig. 3, 4 and 5, having a web which joins the legs together, Fig. 15a,
   15b, 15c show a longitudinal profile 30 which is welded by two lateral welded seams 34a, 34b to
   the tubular wall. The longitudinal profile 30 has two legs 33a, 33b, which are separated from each
30 other by a groove 32. The groove 32 has a groove bottom in the longitudinal profile 30. In the
   groove there is provided a borehole 29, which extends in the longitudinal direction of the
   longitudinal profile 30. Upon severing the tower wall 38 in the region 36, the groove bottom is also

                                                    - 11
   severed and the two legs 33a, 33b are independent of each other. Since the width of the separating
   slot in the region 36 is larger than the groove width 32, the legs remain behind without web
   sections. Instead, these have separation sections on the mutually facing sides of the legs, which are
   formed by the severing of the tower wall and the longitudinal profile. The legs 33a, 33b are
 5 connected by welding at their mutually facing sides to the tower wall 38. If the severed section
   segments are supposed to be joined together once more with the aid of the severed longitudinal
   profile 30, an orientation can be done by a centering pin in the borehole 29. Thanks to the centering
   pin, the legs 33a, 33b are oriented relative to each other and can thus be fastened to each other by
   the threaded bolt 39a, the washer 39b and the nut 39c.

   Fig. 6 shows a top view of an annular flange 12 with an indicated detail "A". Fig. 7 shows an
   enlarged cutout and Fig. 8 a cross section view of detail "A". The annular flange per Fig. 6, 7, 8 is
   designed as a T-annular flange 69, which is intended to attach the lowermost tower section 7 to the
   foundation 3 and its projecting anchor bolts (not shown). The T-annular flange 69 has separation
15 sections with reduced material thickness at predetermined positions, where the annular flange can
   be divided into three annular flange segments 21, 22, 23. At each predetermined position of a
   separation section, the cross section of the T-annular flange 69 is reduced by two slots 63, so that
   only a narrow segment connection 62 remains. This segment connection 62 will be severed later in
   the fabrication process, namely, only after the welding of the T-annular flange 69 to a section piece
20 28 of the tower section 7. Furthermore, the T-annular flange 69 has a plurality of through holes 60,
   which are arranged on either side of the web 61 in two concentric circles of holes.
   For the connecting of the tower sections 7, 8, 9 to each other, annular flanges 12 are provided in the
   form of L-annular flanges 64, having two legs 65, 66 arranged at right angles to each other, as
25 shown in Fig. 9, 10. The first leg 65, pointing out from the plane of the drawing in Fig. 9, is butt
   welded to a section piece 28 of the tower section 7, 8 and thus forms a section of the outer shell of
   the tower section 7, 8. The second leg 66, directed inward in the plane of the drawing, has a
   plurality of through holes 60 for connection means 39, in order to connect the L-annular flange 64
   to the adjoining L-annular flange 64 of an adjoining tower section 7, 8. Thus, the two L-annular
30 flanges 64 form a pair of annular flanges. As can be seen again in Fig. 9 and 10, the L-annular
   flange 64 is provided with separation sections at predetermined positions, where the annular flange
   can be divided into three annular flange segments 21, 22, 23. At the predetermined position of the
   9826431_1(GHMattes) P107484.AU

                                                    - 12
   separation sections the cross section of the L-annular flange 64 is reduced by a slot 68, so that a
   narrow segment connection 67 exists. This segment connection 67 will be severed later in the
   fabrication process after the welding of the L-annular flange 64 to a section piece 28. The segment
   connection 67 forms the separation section for the L-annular flange 64.

   The choice of the connection means 39 is not limited to threaded bolts 39a, washers 39b and nuts
   39c, but rather many other connection means are likewise suitable, especially screw connections
   such as threaded rods with nuts provided on both sides, threaded sleeves with threaded bolts
   provided at both sides, etc.
10
   Fig. 11 shows a top view and Fig. 12 a cross section view of a cutout of an adapter plate 70
   mounted on an L-annular flange 64 of a tower section, serving for the connecting or supporting of
   the tower section during a further processing and especially during a severing of the tower section.
   The L-annular flange 64 is connected to the adapter plate 70 by a screw connection consisting of
15 threaded bolts 39a and nuts 39c. The adapter plate 70 has a one-sided slot 71 for the passage of a
   cutting tool 99. After a severing of the segment connection 67 in the separation section, the annular
   flange segments 21, 22, 23 remain connected with the adapter plate 70 and are thus fixed in their
   position.
20 Fig. 13 shows an overall perspective view of a tower section 7 in a supporting device 80 for the
   lengthwise cutting of tower sections in their 6 o'clock position. The supporting device 80 includes
   two rotatable receiving wheels 81, which are supported by roller bearings 85, 86 running on rails
   84, wherein the rollers of the roller bearings 85, 86 could be driven via electric motors. The
   rotatable receiving wheels 81 are each connected to an annular flange 12 at the end faces of the
25 tower section 7, 8 directly or via an adapter plate 70. The receiving wheels 81 have a wheel hub 82,
   which is connected by spokes 83 to an outer ring. In one modification, not shown, the receiving
   wheels 81 may be rotatably mounted in the wheel hub 82 via mandrels instead of roller bearings 85,
   86. A cutting device 90 which can move via a feeding drive is arranged on the rails 84, with the
   travel of the cutting device 90 extending over the entire length of a tower section.
30
   Fig. 14 shows a perspective view of the cutting device 90 for the lengthwise cutting of tower
   sections 7, 8 in the 6 o'clock position. The cutting device 90 includes a cutting tool 99, preferably
   9826431_1(GHMattes) P107484.AU

                                                     - 13
   configured as a side milling cutter or a saw blade. The cutting tool 99 is rotatably mounted in a
   vertically adjustable tool holder 96. The tool holder 96 furthermore includes guide rollers 98. On
   both sides of the cutting tool 99 and the tool holder 96 there are provided support rollers 97 along
   with support roller lifting devices 94, 95, which ensure a constant cutting depth of the cutting tool
 5 99 in the material, especially in the tubular wall 38 of a tower section 7, 8. The tool holder 96 and
   the support roller lifting devices 94, 95 are held on a cross beam 91, which connects two driving
   frames 92, 93 for two feeding drives, not shown. The feeding drives actuate in synchronism the
   driving wheels which are guided on the rails 84.
10 One sample embodiment not shown has separate height-adjustable punches for lifting the tower
   section mounted in the supporting device in order to compensate for a buckling resulting from the
   force of gravity of the tower section mounted between its bearing points. In order to position the
   punches optimally in height - in the sense of a straight cutting line - at least one optical sensor is
   provided, which is connected to a control circuit for controlling the punch height. The cutting
15 device 90 is mounted and guided movably on rails via at least one feeding drive. Thanks to the
   punches which are independent of the cutting device 90, the loading on the cutting device is
   considerably reduced, especially thanks to the force of gravity not needing to be supported. The
   cutting device according to this second sample embodiment can be more simple in design than the
   cutting device 90 in the sample embodiment of Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 on account of the functional
20 separation; in particular, the support rollers 97 plus the support roller lifting devices 94, 95 shown
   there can be eliminated. Another advantage is that the feeding drives of the cutting device 90 only
   need to provide a power corresponding to the feeding/cutting force.
   Another especially advantageous supporting device, not shown, has two spaced apart, horizontally
25 arranged girders as a bearing bed for a tower section 7, 8 being machined, having slanting or
   concave receiving portions arranged in pairs. The spacing of the girders is larger than the greatest
   width of the cutting device, so that it can move freely on the rails beneath the tower section, the
   rails being preferably laid in a channel in the floor as a kind of subfloor. The cutting device can be
   driven by at least one feeding drive. This cutting device in turn can be more simple in design than
30 the cutting device 90 of the sample embodiment in Fig. 13 and 14; in particular, the support rollers
   97 plus the support roller lifting devices 94, 95 shown there can be eliminated. Another advantage is
   9826431_1(GHMattes) P107484.AU

                                                     - 14
   that the feeding drives of the cutting device 90 only need to be designed for a power corresponding
   to the feeding/cutting force, since they do not need to overcome any supporting load component.

   such that a first planned separation line (19) is positioned in a 6 o'clock position.
10  11.          The method as claimed in claim 10, characterized by a further method step during which
   each annular flange (12) of the tower section (7, 8) is connected at the end face to a receiving wheel
   (81) in order to be rotated on the supporting device into the desired position.
    12.          The method as claimed in claim 10 or 11, wherein the supporting device has beams
15 running in parallel and spaced apart, with the tubular body and/or the tower section (7, 8) being
   positioned on the supporting device in such a manner that the first separation line (19) runs between
   the beams in the six o'clock position.
    13.          The method as claimed in one of claims 10 to 12, wherein at least one movable cutting
20 device (90) with a cutting tool (99) is moved into a starting position near a first annular flange (12)
   and then the cutting tool (99) is brought into engagement via a vertically movable tool holder (96)
   with the first annular flange (12) at the first predetermined position.
    14.          The method as claimed in claim 13, wherein the first annular flange (12) is severed via the
25 cutting tool (99) at a first predetermined position with reduced cross section and thereafter the
   tubular wall (38) is severed along the first separation line (19).
    15.          The method as claimed in claim 14, which comprises the further step of:
   -     rotating the tower section (7, 8) by a predetermined angular amount about its longitudinal axis
30       such that a planned second separation line is positioned in the six o'clock position.
