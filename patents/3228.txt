                                              ORAL CARE IMPLEMENT
                                               RELATED APPLICATION
[0001] This application is a divisional application of Australian Application No. 2014414820,
the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                                    BACKGROUND
[0002] A major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where
a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. While oral care
implements containing tongue scrapers have been used in the past in order to remove bacteria
from the tongue, these oral care implements are inadequate in respect to their effectiveness on
the soft tissue surface of the tongue. These oral care implements are also limited in that the
tissue cleanser is provided only on one major surface of the head and tend to be small in size and
can be ineffective in scraping debris off of the tongue. These oral care implements are further
limited in that the oral care implement provides inadequate comfort when contacting the surface
of a user's gums during cleaning.

[0022] In the following description, the invention is discussed in terms of a manual toothbrush.
However, in other forms, the invention could be in the form of other oral care implements
including a soft-tissue cleansing implement, a powered toothbrush, a refill head, or other ansate
implements designed for oral care.
[0023] Referring first to Figure 1, an oral care implement 100 is illustrated according to one
embodiment of the present invention. The oral care implement 100 generally comprises a handle
110 and a head 120. The handle 110 provides the user with a mechanism by which he/she can
readily grip and manipulate the oral care implement 100.          The handle 110 is generically
illustrated and may be formed of many different shapes, sizes, materials and by a variety of
manufacturing methods that are well-known to those skilled in the art. For example, the handle
110 can be constructed of elastomers, polypropylene, SAN, ABS, or even paper products such as
a typical lollipop stick. If desired, the handle 110 may include a suitable textured grip (not
shown) made of a thermoplastic elastomer or can be a multi-part construction. The details of the
handle 110 are not limiting of the present invention and, thus, require no further discussion for
purposes of the present invention.
[0024] The oral care implement 100 extends from a proximal end 112 to a distal end 113. The
head 120 is operably connected to a distal end of the handle 110. Generally, the head 110 and
the handle 120 of the toothbrush are preferably formed as a single unitary structure using a
molding, milling, machining or other suitable process.      However, in other embodiments, the
handle 110 and head 120 may be formed as separate components which are operably connected
at a later stage of the manufacturing process by any suitable technique known in the art,
including without limitation thermal welding, a tight-fit assembly, a coupling sleeve, adhesion,
or fasteners. Whether the head 120 and handle 110 are of a unitary or multi-piece construction
                                                 5

(including connection techniques) is not limiting of the present invention unless specifically
stated in the claims.
[0025] It should be noted at this time that relative terms such as distal, middle, proximal, upper,
lower, top, bottom, left, right etc. are merely used to delineate relative positions of the
components of the oral care implement 100 with respect to one another and are not intended to
be in any further way limiting of the present invention
[0026] Referring to Figures 2 and 3, the head 120 extends along a longitudinal axis A-A from a
proximal end 131 of the head 120 to a distal end 132 of the head 120. The head 120 generally
comprises a front surface 121, a rear surface 122 that is opposite the front surface 121 (as shown
in Figure 4) and a peripheral surface 123. The peripheral surface 123 extends between the front
surface 121 and the rear surface 122, connecting the front and rear surfaces 121, 122 and
defining a perimeter edge 124 of the front surface 121. The front surface 121, the rear surface
122, and the peripheral surface 123 of the head 120 can take on a wide variety of shapes and
contours, none of which are limiting of the present invention. For example, the surfaces can be
planar, contoured or combinations thereof.                 Furthermore, while the head 120 is normally
widened relative to the neck 111 of the handle 110, it could in some constructions simply be a
continuous extension or narrowing of the handle 110.
[0027] Referring to Figures 3-6 concurrently, the head 120 further comprises an elastomeric
component 150, which may include a bumper portion 151 that forms a distal-most section 130 of
the peripheral surface 123 and a wall portion 152 located along a distal-most section of the
perimeter edge 124.                 The wall portion 152 protrudes above the front surface 121.  The wall
portion 152 extends along the perimeter edge 124 in a continuous manner from a first point 1 of
the perimeter edge 124 to a second point 2 of the perimeter edge 124.                The first and second
points 1, 2 are located on opposite sides of the longitudinal axis A-A. The wall portion 152 may
comprise a first ramped portion 153, a second ramped portion 154, and an apex portion 155 (best
visible in Figure 7). The apex portion 155 is disposed between the first ramped position 153 and
the second ramped position 154.
[0028] In one embodiment, the first ramped portion 153 may extend from the first point 1 to a
fourth point 4 of the perimeter edge 124. The fourth point 4 is located between the first and third
points 1, 3. The height of the first ramped portion 153 of the wall portion 152 increases from the
first point 1 to the fourth point 4. The second ramped portion 154 may extend from the second
                                                           6
10391253 1 (GHMatters) P103727.AU.1

point 2 to a fifth point 5 of the perimeter edge 124. The fifth point 5 is located between the
second and third points 2, 3. The height of the second ramped portion 154 of the wall portion
152 increases from the second point 2 to the fourth point 5. The apex portion 155 may extend
from the fourth point 4 to the fifth point 5.         The apex portion 155, in the exemplified
embodiment, has a substantially constant height from the fourth point 4 to the fifth point 5.
[0029] The wall portion 152 has a maximum height Hmax at the third point 3 of the perimeter
edge 124, which is located between the first and second points 1, 2. The third point 3 is located
on the longitudinal axis IV and on the apex portion 155. The wall portion 152 has a substantially
zero height at the first and second points 1, 2.
[0030] In another embodiment, the first ramped portion 153 may extend from the first point 1 to
the third point 3, wherein the height of the first ramped portion 153 of the wall portion 152 may
increase from the first point 1 to the third point 3. The second ramped portion 154 may extend
from the second point 2 to the third point 3, wherein the height of the second ramped portion 154
of the wall portion 152 may increase from the second point 2 to the third point 3. In such an
embodiment, the apex portion 155 may take the form of a single point, rather than a section.
[0031] The first and second ramped portions 153, 154 may comprise an upper edge 156, 157 that
appear as a linear slope when the head is viewed in side profile (see Figures 5 and 6). The first
upper edge 156 of the first ramped portion 153 may extend upward from the front surface 121 at
an angle of 01 and the second upper edge 157 of the second ramped portion 154 may extend
upward from the front surface 121 at an angle of 02.        The 01 and 02 may be the same or
different and each 01 and 02 may be selected from an angle ranging from about 10' to about
60'; preferably from about 150 to about 450; and more preferably about 25' to about 35'.
[0032] The wall portion 152 and a transverse line B-B extending between the first and second
points 1, 2 of the perimeter edge 124 collectively define a distal-most area 130 of the front
surface 121 of the head 120. A remaining portion of the perimeter edge 125 may be free of the
wall portion 152. The remaining portion of the perimeter edge 125 may extend from the first
point 1 to a sixth point 6 alone the perimeter edge 125. The remaining portion of the perimeter
edge 125 may also extend from the second point 2 to a seventh point 7 along the perimeter edge
125. In some embodiments, the wall portion 152 is arcuate and comprises a convex inner surface
and a concave outer surface. The wall portion 152 may be free of through-holes.
                                                   7
10391253 1 (GHMatters) P103727.AU.1

[0033] Referring to Figures 5 and 6, the elastomeric component 150 may further comprise a
plurality of spaced-apart ridges 158 protruding from an outer surface of the bumper portion 151
and an outer surface of the wall portion 152. The elastomeric component 150 may also comprise
a plurality of spaced-apart ridges 158 protruding from an outer surface along at least a portion of
the peripheral surface 123. The elastomeric component 150 may further comprise a soft tissue
cleanser 180 on the rear surface 122 of the head 120, the soft tissue cleanser 180 comprising a
plurality of protuberances 181. In some embodiments, the elastomeric component 150 may be
an integrally formed component and include the bumper portion 151, the wall portion 152, the
plurality of spaced-apart ridges 158, and the soft tissue cleanser 180.
[0034] The soft tissue cleanser 180 is preferably constructed of a biocompatible resilient material
suitable for uses in an oral hygiene apparatus, such as a thermoplastic elastomer. As an example,
one preferred elastomeric material is styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene block copolymer (SEBS)
manufactured by GLS Corporation. Nevertheless, SEBS material from other manufacturers or
other materials. The soft tissue cleanser 180 can be constructed of different types of resilient
materials or the same resilient material with one or more different characteristics, such as color,
hardness, density, flavor, and/or sensate.
[0035] As shown in Figure 4, the head 120 comprises a base portion 126 formed of a rigid
plastic, such as polypropylene. The elastomeric component 150 may be injection molded to the
base portion 126. The base portion 126 comprises a peripheral wall 127 that forms a basin 128,
the head 120 further comprises a head plate 160 disposed within the basin 128 and coupled to the
base portion 126.
[0036] The head plate 160 comprises a plurality of through holes 161. A plurality of cleaning
elements 140 are provided that extend through the through holes 161 of the head plate.         The
plurality of cleaning elements 140 extend from the front surface 121 of the head 120.
[0037] Each of the plurality of cleaning elements 140 comprise a cleaning portion 141 extending
from an upper surface 162 of the head plate 160 for cleaning contact with an oral surface. Each
of the plurality of cleaning elements 140 also includes a melt portion 142 located between a
lower surface of the head plate 163 and a floor of the basin 129. The melt portions 142 anchor
the cleaning elements 140 to the head.        While the plurality of cleaning elements 140 are
particularly suited for brushing teeth, the plurality of cleaning elements 140 can also be used to
clean oral soft tissue, such as a tongue, gums, or cheeks instead of or in addition to teeth.

10391253 1 (GHMatters) P103727.AU.1

[0038] As used herein, the term "cleaning element" is used in a generic sense to refer to any
structure that can be used to clean or massage an oral surface through relative surface contact.
Common examples of "cleaning elements" include, without limitation, filament bristles, fiber
bristles, nylon bristles, spiral bristles, rubber bristles, elastomeric protrusions, flexible polymer
protrusions, combinations thereof and/or structures containing such materials or combinations.
[0039] Referring to Figures 4-7, the plurality of cleaning elements 140 comprises a plurality of
distal cleaning elements 143 extending from the distal-most area 130 of the front surface 121.
The maximum height Hmax of the wall portion 152 is less than or equal to one half of a height
HCE      of a shortest one of the plurality of distal tooth cleaning elements 143. In one embodiment,
the maximum height Hmax of the wall portion 152 is less than or equal to one third of the height
HCE       of a shortest one of the plurality of distal tooth cleaning elements 143.                    In another
embodiment, the maximum height Hmax of the wall portion 152 is less than or equal to one
quarter of the height               HCE of a shortest one of the plurality of distal tooth cleaning elements 143.
The plurality of distal tooth cleaning elements 143 may comprise tapered bristles.
[0040] In some embodiments the peripheral surface                          123 may comprise the elastomeric
component 150 and the rigid plastic used to form the base portion 126 of the head 120. In
another embodiment, the peripheral surface 123 may be entirely formed by the elastomeric
component 150.
[0041] With reference to Figures 5-9, the details of the elastomeric component 150 includes the
soft tissue cleanser 180, which will now be discussed. The soft tissue cleanser 180 is on the rear
surface 122 of the head 120 and comprises a pad 188 that forms at least a portion of the rear
surface 122 of the head 120 of the oral care implement 100. The pad 188 is preferably injection
molded directly to the head 120 but can be molded separately and later fixed to the head 120 if
desired, for example by an adhesive or sonic welding. The pad 188 extends from a distal end
132 of the head 120 to a proximal end 131 of the head 120 and may cover substantially the entire
width of the head 120, extending from a first lateral edge 133 of the head 120 towards a second
lateral edge 134 of the head 120.
[0042] The elastomeric component 150 may have one or more exposed underlying head portions
189 extending therethrough exposing the base portion 126.                         The exposed underlying head
portions 189 may be a variety of geometric shapes - such as circular or crescent shapes. In one
embodiment, the exposed underlying head portions 189 define a boundary for which a plurality
                                                               9

of protuberances 181 are positioned on the rear surface 122 of the head 120. In one embodiment,
crescent shaped exposed underlying head portions 189 define an annular shaped layout of the
plurality of protuberances 181 when looking at the rear surface 122 of the head 120.
[0043] The pad 188 includes an exposed top surface 190 on the rear surface 122 of the head.
The plurality of protuberances 181 protrude from the rear surface 122 of the head 120 from the
top surface 190 of the pad 188. The plurality of protuberances 181 may include a first plurality
of protuberances 182 arranged in a first annular zone 170 on the rear surface 122. The first
annular zone 170 is the area defined between a first dotted line 173 and a second dotted line 174.
Each of the first plurality of protuberances 182 may have a height between a first predetermined
height Hi and a second predetermined height H2, the second predetermined height H2 being
greater than the first predetermined height Hi.
[0044] The plurality of protuberances        181 may further include a plurality of second
protuberances 183 protruding from the rear surface 122 of the head 120 and arranged in a second
annular zone 171 on the rear surface 122. The first annular zone 170 surrounds the second
annular zone 171. The second annular zone 171 is the area defined between the second dotted
line 174 and a third dotted line 175. Each of the second plurality of protuberances 183 may have
a height between the second predetermined height H2 and a third predetermined height H3, the
third predetermined height H3 being greater than the second predetermined height H2.
[0045] The plurality of protuberances 181 may further include a plurality of third protuberances
184 protruding from the rear surface 122 of the head 120 and arranged in a third zone 172 on the
rear surface 122. The second annular zone 171 surrounds the third annular zone 173. The third
zone 172 may be annular zone or it may be a central zone. The third annular zone 172 is the area
defined within the third dotted line 175. Each of the third plurality of protuberances 184 have a
height between the third predetermined height H3 and a fourth predetermined height H4, the
fourth predetermined height H4 being greater than the third predetermined height H3.
[0046] In some embodiments,          the plurality of first protuberances     182 may comprise
protuberances having a plurality of different heights between the first and second predetermined
heights Hi, H2. The plurality of second protuberances 183 may comprise protuberances having a
plurality of different heights between the second and third predetermined heights H2, H3. The
plurality of third protuberances 184 may comprises protuberances having a plurality of different
heights between the third and fourth predetermined heights H3, H4.
                                                  10
10391253 1 (GHMatters) P103727.AU.1

[0047] In certain embodiments, the plurality of first protuberances           182 consist only of
protuberances having a height between the first and second predetermined heights H1, H2. The
plurality of second protuberances 183 consist only of protuberances having a height between the
second and third predetermined heights H2, H3. The plurality of third protuberances 184 consist
only of protuberances having a height between the third and fourth predetermined heights H3, H4.
[0048] The first predetermined height Hi may be in a range of 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm, the second
predetermined height H2 may be in a range of 1.5 mm to 2.5 mm, the third predetermined height
H3 may be in a range of 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm, and the fourth predetermined height H4 may be in a
range of 3.5 mm to 6. 0 mm.
[0049] In some embodiments, free ends of the first, second and third protuberances 182, 183,
184 collectively form a convex side profile (see Figures 5 and 6). In some embodiments, the free
ends of the first, second and third protuberances 182, 183, 184 may also collectively form a
convex top profile (see Figures 7).
[0050] The plurality of first protuberances 182 comprises first conical nubs, the plurality of
second protuberances                183 comprises second conical nubs, and the plurality of third
protuberances 184 comprises third conical nubs.            In one embodiment, the plurality of first
protuberances 182 consists only of the first conical nubs, the plurality of second protuberances
183 consists only of second conical nubs, and the plurality of third protuberances 184 consists
only of the third conical nubs. The plurality of conical nubs extends from the pad portion 188.
[0051] As used herein a "nub" is generally meant to include a column-like protrusion (without
limitation to the cross-sectional shape of the protrusion) which is upstanding from a base surface.
In a general sense, the nub, in the preferred construction, has a height that is greater than the
width at the base of the nub (as measured in the longest direction). Nevertheless, nubs could
include projections wherein the widths and heights are roughly the same or wherein the heights
are somewhat smaller than the base widths. Moreover, in some circumstances (e.g., where the
nub tapers to a tip or includes a base portion that narrows to a smaller projection), the base width
can be substantially larger than the height.
[0052] The first, second, and third plurality of nubs 182-184 are designed to engage the oral soft
tissue to significantly reduce a major source of bad breath in people and improve hygiene. The
first, second, and third plurality of nubs 182-184 enable removal of microflora and other debris
from the tongue and other soft tissue surfaces within the mouth. The tongue, in particular, is
                                                       11
10391253 1 (GHMatters) P103727.AU.1

prone to develop bacterial coatings that are known to harbor organisms and debris that can
contribute to bad breath. This microflora can be found in the recesses between the papillae on
most of the tongue's upper surface as well as along other soft tissue surfaces in the mouth. When
engaged or otherwise pulled against a tongue surface, for example, the first, second, and third
nubs provide for gentle engagement with the soft tissue while reaching downward into the
recesses of adjacent papillae of the tongue.        The elastomeric construction of the soft tissue
cleanser 180 also enables a top surface 190 of the pad 188 to follow the natural contours of the
oral tissue surfaces, such as the tongue, cheeks, lips, and gums of a user. Moreover, the first,
second, and third nubs are able to flex as needed to traverse and clean the soft tissue surfaces in
the mouth along which it is moved.
[0053] In the illustrated embodiment, the first, second, and third nubs are preferably conically
shaped. As used herein, "conically shaped" or "conical" is meant to include true cones, frusto
conically shaped elements, and other shapes that taper to a narrow end and thereby resemble a
cone irrespective of whether they are uniform, continuous in their taper, or have rounded cross
sections. The base portion of each the conically shaped first, second, and third nubs 182-184 is
larger than the corresponding tip portion.
[0054] Furthermore, the resilient material of the first, second, and/or third annular zones 170,
171, 172 may also be imbued with a sensory material, which can be any suitable biocompatible
medication or chemical for oral use. The sensory material is released inside the mouth, lips, or
cheeks by way of several methods, including but not limited to abrasion, a temperature change, a
change in pH or dissolution. In one embodiment, the sensory material is a sensate that provides
a biochemical sensory response to the inside tissue and surfaces of the mouth. Such a sensory
response is understood to result from stimulation of the trigeminal nerve of a human. A sensate
generally produces a physiological effect without a taste, with such effect usually represented by
the terms cooling, tingle, and hot (or heat). Sensates are usually derived from single compounds
that are not volatile and that do not have a smell or taste per se. As one example, a chemical
known as capsaicin, found naturally in chili peppers, can be used to provide a tingle, a hot or
warm massage, or a heating or warm, soothing sensation to a user. Capsaicin is also known to
provide pain relief and numbing sensations when topically applied. Some examples of sensates
that produce cooling sensations include (-)-menthol and camphor. Most of the polyols, including
maltitol syrup, sorbitol, mannitol, erythritol, isomalt and xylitol, also provide a cooling sensation.
                                                   12
10391253 1 (GHMatters) P103727.AU.1

The coolest of the polyols, erythritol, provides a distinct cooling sensation. Both erythritol and
xylitol cool the mouth and fight the sensation of dry mouth commonly associated with
prescription drugs and dental hygiene products. Erythritol is a naturally occurring four-carbon
structure. Xylitol is a five-carbon sugar found in fruits and vegetables and made in small
amounts by the human system as a metabolic intermediate.
[0055] In another embodiment, the sensory material is provided as flavoring agent for causing an
olfactory sensory response in a human. A flavor agent is commonly understood to include a
mixture of compounds that are volatile and produce an aromatic effect and that stimulate the
olfactory bulb.                 Flavors are generally transmitted through the nasal passages, and are often
selected and used for their unique association with certain consumer benefits, such as lavender
for stress relief or relaxation.               Another flavor example is chamomile, which has a strong,
aromatic smell and is often used medicinally against sore stomach and as a relaxant to help you
fall asleep.              Chamomile is also used as a mouthwash against oral mucositis (the swelling,
irritation, and ulceration of the mucosal cells that line the digestive tract).
[0056] In one embodiment, the first, second, and/or third annular zone 170, 171, 172 can be
imbued with both a sensate component and a flavor component. The soft tissue cleanser 180
may be an integrally formed singular component.
[0057] Referring now to FIGS. 6-8 concurrently, one preferred embodiment of manufacturing
the head 120 via an injection molding process will be described. First, the head 120 is formed by
injecting a liquefied hard plastic, such as PP or SAN, into a mold having the appropriately
shaped fill cavity. Once the head 120 is sufficiently cooled (the structure of which is described
above), an outer mold is placed about the head 120 for forming the elastomeric component 150.
The elastomeric component 150 is formed by an overmolding process which involves injecting a
single shot of a first type of liquefied thermoplastic elastomer about the head 122 via a first port
having a first size. The first type of liquefied thermoplastic elastomer surrounds the head 120
and fills available gaps/grooves on the head 120. As a result, the elastomeric component 150 is
formed as illustrated. The elastomeric component 150 may also be made using separate shots,
each using different types of thermoplastic elastomer, to form different components of the
elastomeric component 150 - for example one shot for the pad 188 and another shot for the
plurality of protuberances 181. This allows the pad 188 and the plurality of protuberances 181 to
                                                            13
10391253 1 (GHMatters) P103727.AU.1

be formed of different types of elastomers, which may be useful for elastomeric components 150
having differing colors, flavors, sensates or material properties, such as hardness or density.
[0058] Another embodiment of manufacturing the head 120 includes the head plate 160 which
clusters of the plurality of cleaning elements 140 are inserted through the through holes 161.
The rear ends of the plurality of cleaning elements 140 are melted thereby affixing the plurality
of cleaning elements 140 to the head plate 160. The melted portions form the melt portion
142 that adheres to the head plate 160 and bonds the plurality of cleaning elements 140 to each
other.
[0059] As used throughout, ranges are used as shorthand for describing each and every value
that is within the range. Any value within the range can be selected as the terminus of the range.

[0060] While the invention has been described with respect to specific examples including
presently preferred modes of carrying out the invention, those skilled in the art will appreciate
that there are numerous variations and permutations of the above described systems and
techniques. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and
functional modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.

where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word
"comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e.
