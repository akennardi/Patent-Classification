Method of Rheology Control
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001] The present invention relates to a method of controlling the rheology of slurries.
More particularly, the present invention is intended for control of tailings slurries to
facilitate their transportation and/or storage as well as affect their separation to facilitate
recovery of valuable minerals.
BACKGROUND ART
[0002] Many industrial applications comprise slurries, in particular tailings slurries. The
ability to handle such slurries is largely determined by their viscosities, which in turn is
oftentimes a function of the solids contents of the slurries. It also depends on the
particular composition of the ore being handled and the quantity of clay slimes, which
generally increase viscosity. In the hydraulic transportation or handling of slurries, it is
desirable to maintain the maximum percent solids in the slurry. In order to satisfactorily
pump a slurry, it must have a suitably low viscosity and low yield stress (yield stress
being the minimum shear stress that needs to be exceeded for flow of the slurry to
occur).    It is frequently impractical to ore slurries when they contain more than 25-80
percent by weight or so of suspended solids due to the extremely high viscosities that
are encountered.       The achievement of a desired viscosity may operate to limit the
amount of solids which can be maintained therein.
[0003] While it may be possible to reduce the viscosity of a slurry for transport purposes,
storage of a low viscosity slurry in, for example a tailings dam can be hazardous and
dam failure can result in fast flowing slurry that may be toxic or highly acidic or alkaline.
Fast flowing tailings arising from failure of elevated dam have already killed a number of
people in Brazil and Hungary in the last few years in addition to huge property damage.

[0007] In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method for
controlling the rheology of iron ore slurries, the method comprising the steps of:
       adding a source of hydroxide ions to a slurry; and
       adding a source of phosphate ions to the slurry,
thereby decreasing the viscosity of the slurry.
[0008] Preferably, the method comprises the further step of
       adding a source of calcium ions to the slurry,
thereby increasing the viscosity of the slurry.
[0009] In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method for
controlling the rheology of slurries, the method comprising the steps of:
       adding a source of hydroxide ions to a slurry; and
       adding a source of phosphate ions to the slurry,
thereby decreasing the viscosity of the slurry, and
       adding a source of calcium ions to the slurry,
thereby increasing the viscosity of the slurry.
[0010]The steps of adding a source of hydroxide ions and adding a source of
phosphate ions may be conducted sequentially in either order or simultaneously.
Preferably, the steps of adding a source of hydroxide ions and adding a source of
phosphate ions are conducted simultaneously.

[0011] In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method for
controlling the rheology of slurries, the method comprising the steps of:
        adding a mixture of a source of hydroxide ions and a source of phosphate ions to
        the slurry,
thereby decreasing the viscosity of the slurry, and
        adding a source of calcium ions to the slurry,
thereby increasing the viscosity of the slurry.
[0012] The source of hydroxide ions is preferably selected from the group comprising
sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.         It will be appreciated that the source of
hydroxide ions may be a combination of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.
[0013] The source of phosphate ions is preferably selected from the group comprising
orthophosphates, oligophosphates and polyphosphates.
[0014] The step of adding a source of phosphate ions may comprise adding more than
one source of phosphate ions.
[0015] It will be appreciated that the source of phosphate may be provided with varying
degrees of dissociation.
[0016] Where the source of phosphate is an orthophosphate, the phosphate may
comprise     orthophosphate    (P0 43-), hydrogen    phosphate    (HP0 4 2 -) or  dihydrogen
phosphate (H2 PO4-). It will be appreciated that dissociation of orthophosphoric acid is
favoured at higher pH.
[0017] Non-limiting examples of oligophosphates include pyrophosphate (P2 0 7 4-),
tripolyphosphate (P3 0 105-), tetrapolyphosphate (P40 136-), trimetaphosphate (P3 0 9 3 -),
hexametaphosphate (P6 0 18 6-) and phosphoric anhydride (P40 10 ).
[0018] Polyphosphate may be described generally as {O[P(O)(OH)              - O]}2+.  Where
provided, polyphosphate may be linear, branched or cyclic.
[0019] The phosphates are preferably provided as alkali metal salts.

[0020] Advantageously, the addition of the hydroxide ions and the phosphate ions,
reduces the viscosity of the slurry. This is advantageous when it is desired to pump the
slurry as is known in the art.
[0021] The source of calcium ions may be any source that provides solubilised diprotic
calcium ions.     Preferably, the calcium ions are selected from the group comprising
calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, calcium chloride and mixtures thereof.
[0022] Advantageously, the addition of the calcium ions increases the viscosity of the
slurry. This is advantageous when the pumped slurry with reduced viscosity is to be
stored in, for example, a tailings dam.
[0023] The mass ratio of hydroxide to phosphate may be between 1:999 and 999:1
(sodium hydroxide to sodium phosphate). That is, between 0.1 % hydroxide to 99.9 %
hydroxide relative to the mass of phosphate.        In one form of the invention, the mass
ratio of hydroxide to phosphate is between 1:99 and 99:1.         In an alternate form of the
invention, the mass ratio of hydroxide to phosphate is between 1:9 and 9:1.            In an
alternate form of the invention, the mass ratio of hydroxide to phosphate is between 1:5
and 5:1. In an alternate form of the invention, the mass ratio of hydroxide to phosphate
is between 1:4 and 4:1.        In an alternate form of the invention, the mass ratio of
hydroxide to phosphate is between 1:3 and 3:1.         In an alternate form of the invention,
the mass ratio of hydroxide to phosphate is between 1:2 and 2:1.
[0024] In one form of the invention, the mass ratio of hydroxide to phosphate is about
1:2. In an alternate form of the invention, the mass ratio of hydroxide to phosphate is
about 2:1.      In an alternate form of the invention, the mass ratio of hydroxide to
phosphate is about 1:1.
[0025] Preferably, the hydroxide and the phosphate are added simultaneously as a
single composite solution.       Preferably, the composite solution has a concentration
between 5 and 25 wt%.         In one form of the invention, the composite solution has a
concentration between 6 and 20 wt%.            In an alternate form of the invention, the
composite solution has a concentration between 8 and 14 wt%.
[0026] It will be appreciated that the amount of composite solution added to the slurry to
provide a desired viscosity will depend on the initial slurry viscosity.

[0027] Preferably, the solids ratio of composite additives to mineral solids in the mixture
of the composite solution and mineral slurries is between about 0.01 and 1.0 dwb% (g
of composite additive solids per 100 g of mineral solids). In one form of the invention,
the solids ratio of the composite additives to mineral slurry solids is about 0.1 dwb%. In
an alternate form of the invention, the solids ratio of the composite additives to mineral
slurry solids is less than 0.1 dwb%.
[0028] The solids concentration of the mineral slurry will be at least 5 wt%. The solids
concentration of the mineral slurry may be between 10 and 80 wt.%.
[0029] In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method for settling
mineral slurries, the method comprising the steps of:
        adding a source of hydroxide ions to a slurry; and
        adding a source of phosphate ions to the slurry.
[0030] The steps of adding a source of hydroxide ions and adding a source of
phosphate ions may be conducted sequentially in either order or simultaneously.
Preferably, the steps of adding a source of hydroxide ions and adding a source of
phosphate ions are conducted simultaneously.
[0031] In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method for settling
mineral slurries, the method comprising the steps of:
        adding a mixture of source of hydroxide ions and a source of phosphate ions to
        the slurry,
thereby settling the mineral slurry.
[0032] The source of hydroxide ions is preferably selected from the group comprising
sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.        It will be appreciated that the source of
hydroxide ions may be a combination of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.
[0033] The source of phosphate ions is preferably selected from the group comprising
orthophosphate, oligophosphates and polyphosphates.
[0034] The source of phosphate may be provided with varying degrees of dissociation.

[0035] Where the source of phosphate is an orthophosphate, the phosphate may
comprise    orthophosphate     (P0 43-), hydrogen   phosphate     (HP0 4 2 -) or  dihydrogen
phosphate (H2 PO4-). It will be appreciated that dissociation of orthophosphoric acid is
favoured at higher pH.
[0036] Non-limiting examples of oligophosphates include pyrophosphate (P2 0 7 4-),
tripolyphosphate (P3 0 105-), tetrapolyphosphate (P40 136-), trimetaphosphate (P3 0 9 3 -),
hexametaphosphate (P6 0 18 6-) and phosphoric anhydride (P40 10 ).
[0037] Polyphosphate may be described generally as {O[P(O)(OH)              - O]}2+.  Where
provided, polyphosphate may be linear, branched or cyclic.
[0038] The phosphates are preferably provided as alkali metal salts.
[0039] I understand the concentration of the solutions in the experiments was 1 to 30
wt%.
[0040] The mass ratio of hydroxide to phosphate may be between 1:999 and 999:1
(sodium hydroxide to sodium phosphate). That is, between 0.1 % hydroxide to 99.9 %
hydroxide relative to the mass of phosphate. In one form of the invention, the mass
ratio of hydroxide to phosphate is between 1:99 and 99:1.       In an alternate form of the
invention, the mass ratio of hydroxide to phosphate is between 1:9 and 9:1.             In an
alternate form of the invention, the mass ratio of hydroxide to phosphate is between 1:5
and 5:1. In an alternate form of the invention, the mass ratio of hydroxide to phosphate
is between 1:4 and 4:1.       In an alternate form of the invention, the mass ratio of
hydroxide to phosphate is between 1:3 and 3:1.       In an alternate form of the invention,
the mass ratio of hydroxide to phosphate is between 1:2 and 2:1.
[0041] In one form of the invention, the mass ratio of hydroxide to phosphate is about
1:2. In an alternate form of the invention, the mass ratio of hydroxide to phosphate is
about 2:1.    In an alternate form of the invention, the mass ratio of hydroxide to
phosphate is about 1:1.
[0042] Preferably, the hydroxide and the phosphate are added simultaneously as a
single composite solution.      Preferably, the composite solution has a concentration
between 5 and 25 wt%.        In one form of the invention, the composite solution has a
concentration between 6 and 20 wt%.           In an alternate form of the invention, the
composite solution has a concentration between 8 and 14 wt%.

[0043] It will be appreciated that the amount of composite solution added to the slurry to
provide a desired viscosity will depend on the initial slurry viscosity.
[0044] Preferably, the solids ratio of composite additives to mineral solids in the mixture
of the composite solution and mineral slurries is between about 0.01 and 1.0 dwb% (g
of composite additive solids per 100 g of mineral solids). In one form of the invention,
the solids ratio of the composite additives to mineral slurry solids is about 0.1 dwb%. In
one form an alternate form of the invention, the solids ratio of the composite additives to
mineral slurry solids is less than 0.1 dwb%.
[0045] A yield stress in the range of 0-50 Pa after additive addition is preferred.
However, it will be appreciated that, from an economic viewpoint, low concentration
brings about smaller viscosity reduction but it is cost effective. High concentration
reduced the viscosity significantly but the cost saving is negative due to high additives
and environmental costs relative to pumping cost.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
Experimental
[0047] An iron ore mineral slurry was sourced from a mine in Western Australia. All
rheological characterizations were conducted on slurries with 58 wt% solids. All mineral
separation experiments were conducted on slurries with 29 wt% solids. The rheological
properties, flow and yield stress, were characterised with the Haake VT550 viscotester
and Brookfield DV viscometers.
Results
NaOH-Nan(PO 3)17 composite additive system
[0048] Single solutions of NaOH and Nan(PO 3 ) 17 were prepared at three composition
ratios, 1:2, 1:1 and 1:0.5 of NaOH:Nan(PO)            17 by mass.    Solutions with dissolved
additive solids concentration ranging from 12 to 14 wt% were prepared.
[0049] The effects of NaOH, Nan(PO 3 )1 7 and NaOH-Nan(PO3 )1 7 composites in the mass
ratio of 1:2, 1:1 and 1:0.5 on the rheological properties of a 58 wt% iron ore mineral
slurries were evaluated. Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c show the viscosity-shear rate behaviour
under the influence of these composite additives. The slurries displayed shear thinning

behaviour as represented by a viscosity decreasing with increasing shear rate. The
viscosity-shear rate curve moved increasingly to the lower viscosity region with
increasing additive concentration. Single component additives, NaOH and Nan(PO3 ) 17
also displayed a similar trend as shown in Figures 1d and 1e.
[0050] The effect of changes in additive concentration is clearer from a plot of viscosity
at a fixed shear rate (139 s-1) as a function of additive concentration for all five additives
and composites as shown in Figure 1f.            The typical shear rate encountered by a
concentrated suspension during the processing such as pipeline transportation is about
100 s-1. More than 90 % reduction in viscosity is observed at high additive concentration
for all additives. However, the composite additives, in addition to displaying the same
viscosity-additive concentration relationship require significantly less additive to achieve
the same result as the single component additives of NaOH and Nan(PO3 )1 7. At a dose
of 0.06 dwb%, the composite additives significantly reduced the slurry viscosity, while
the single component additives provided virtually no change in viscosity. A 30 % higher
dose of the single component additives was required to achieve the same viscosity
decrease as the composite additives. To achieve a 90 % reduction in viscosity, the
composite additives required a dose of about 0.08 dwb% while the single component
additives required a dose of about 0.13 dwb% - an increase of over 50 %.
[0051] Figure 1g shows the yield stress-additive concentration relationships for all
additives. The as-received slurries displayed a high yield stress of 60-70 Pa. As
discussed above, higher dosages of NaOH or Nan(PO 3 )1 7 are required compared to
composite additives to achieve the same yield stress reduction.
[0052] The yield stress results of Figure 1g were replotted in terms of pH instead of
additive dosage for NaOH, Nan(PO 3 )1 7 and x:y NaOH:Nan(PO)         17 (x:y: 1:0.5, 1:1 and
1:2) (see Figure 1h). Increasing the concentration of Nan(PO 3 )1 7 did not increase the pH
of the slurry significantly unlike NaOH. The extent of the pH increase by the composite
additives x:y NaOH:Nan(PO)        17 varied with NaOH content.    The composite additives
with higher NaOH content increased the pH to a greater extent. In terms of additive
dosage, the plot of the decreasing trend of the yield stress with additive dosage is
almost identical for all composite additives. However when plotted in terms of pH the
difference between the plots was more pronounced.

NaOH-Na 5 P3010 composite additive system
[0053] NaOH-Na5 P3O 10 composite additive solutions were restricted to only 8.5 wt%
solids due to solubility limitations. Two composite solutions were prepared with the
mass ratio of NaOH to Na5 P3 O 10 being 1:1 and 1:2.
[0054] The viscosity-shear rate behaviour under the influence of these two composite
solutions are shown in Figures 2a and 2b. The viscosity-shear rate curve is shifted
progressively down the viscosity axis with increasing additive concentration.     At any
given shear rate, the viscosity decreased with increasing additive concentration. At low
shear rates of less 500 s-1, the decrease was as much as 10-fold or more than 90% of
the viscosity of the untreated slurries.   This means a very significant cost saving in
pumping cost. The tailings can be deposited in a more concentrated form.
[0055] The viscosity at the shear rate of 139 s-1 at various additive dosages was
compared for the two composite solutions as shown in Figures 2c and 2e. More than
90% reduction in the viscosity was observed for both composite solutions at high
dosage.
[0056] However the effect of additive dosage on the yield stress is the same for the two
composite additive solutions. The yield stress decreased significantly with increasing
dosage. It decreased from ~ 70 Pa to less than 1 Pa at 0.12 dwb% dosage.
NaOH-Na 4P2O7 composite additive system
[0057] NaOH-Na 4P20 7 composite additive solutions were restricted to only 6.5 wt%
solids due to solubility limitations. Two composite solutions were prepared with the
mass ratio of NaOH to Na5 P3 O 10 being 1:1 and 1:2. The temperature of the solutions
was elevated to 50-60 C in a heated sonic bath to dissolve the crystals before use.
[0058] Figures 3a and 3b show the effect of additive dosage on the viscosity-shear rate
behaviour for the two composite solutions. Like the other phosphate-based composite
additive systems, the viscosity-shear rate curve was shifted progressively down the
viscosity axis with increasing additive concentration.    At any given shear rate, the
viscosity decreased with increasing additive concentration. The decrease was as much
as 10-fold or more than 90% of the viscosity of the untreated slurries at certain shear
rates.

[0059] The variation of the viscosity with additive dosage at the shear rate of 139 s1
was compared for the two composite additive solutions.             The dramatic reduction in
viscosity is reflected by the log scale of the viscosity axis. The viscosity reduction at the
highest dosage is as much as 95 %. The viscosity-dosage relationship was observed to
be similar for the two composite additives.
[0060] The yield stress-additive dosage relationship is shown in Figure 3d.                The
behaviour of a decreasing yield stress with additive dosage is similar to that observed
for the other phosphate-based additive system.           The yield stress reduction at high
additive dosage of 0.12 dwb% is very significant.
NaOH-Na 2HPO 4 system
[0061]The effect of the NaOH-Na 2HPO 4 on the viscosity-shear rate behaviour of
58 wt% iron ore tailing slurries is shown in Figure 4a. Significant reduction in the slurry
viscosity was observed upon the addition of 0.063 dwb% additive.                The phosphate
additive is particularly suitable for treating slurries with a relatively high concentration of
dissolved Ca 2 , ions. Ca ions tend to increase the viscosity of the iron ore slurries at
alkaline pH. The phosphate takes out the Ca 2 , ions via precipitation.
[0062] The reduction of the yield stress by the NaOH-Na 2HPO 4 additive is shown in
Figure 4b.     The extent of the reduction is more than 90% at 0.12 dwb% NaOH
Na2 HPO 4.
[0063] The advantages derived from the use of these additives are a reduction in
pumping cost, greater or more consistent slurry daily throughput and smaller
environment footprint in terms of smaller waste dam and lower water consumption
required. However if the low viscosity of the concentrated tailings slurry persists with
storage time it can pose a danger in the event of a breach in the containment
performance of the dam.         The present invention is also directed to a method of
increasing the gel strength or "solidifying" the concentrated slurry.
Lime Addition
[0064] It may be desirable to pump a slurry at low viscosity for a variety of reasons
including the energy costs of pumping and wear on pipework. In addition, a plant can
function more smoothly and produce a high throughput of minerals.                However at a
tailings dam, it may be desirable to increase the yield stress or structural strength and

viscosity of the slurry.    In the event of dam collapse, such a slurry would not flow at
great speed or velocity.
[0065] In Figure 5, an iron slurry at pH 6.05 with a yield stress of 103 Pa was first
treated 1:2 NaOH:Nan(PO3 )1 7 additive. The yield stress was reduced to 12.5 Pa and the
slurry displayed a pH of 8.2 which upon a short rest of 1 hr displayed a lower pH of
7.84. This low yield stress and viscosity slurry was treated with lime or CaO.         Lime
treatment increased the yield stress to 170 Pa at pH 9.74 and to 320 Pa at pH of 10.6.
The amount of CaO needed to increase the yield stress to 320 Pa was 0.27 dwb% (g
CaO per 1O0g tailing solids).
[0066] In another example, the addition of 0.3 and 0.79 dwb% of CaO increased the
yield stress or gel strength from 65 Pa to 223 and 370 Pa respectively as seen in Figure
6. The increased gel strength or paste consistency of the tailing slurry will reduce the
free-flowing ability of the tailings slurry.
[0067] Depending upon the elevation of the tailings dam location, the yield stress
required will range from 100 Pa for no elevation to as high as 1000 Pa for very high
elevation (e.g. when located high up a mountain side).
iii) Lime treated or high soluble calcium content mineral slurries
[0068] Lime is commonly used as a pH regulator in mineral slurry processing or to
neutralise acidic slurries. The high calcium content will increase the slurry yield stress
and viscosity at high pH. There are composite additives that can be used to reduce the
yield stress or viscosity of this high calcium content slurry as shown in the results in the
Figure 7. Iron ore mineral slurries were treated with 0.11 dwb% Ca (g Ca per 100 g
mineral solids). This treatment caused the yield stress to increase from 50 to 105 Pa
and the pH to increase from 6.0 to 9.6.         Two composite additives, 11.76 wt% X (=
4wt%NaOH+4.8%Na 2HPO 4              +     2.9%    Nan(PO3 )17 )    and  12.58    wt%       A
(=4.24%NaOH+8.34wt%Nan(PO)            17)  and were evaluated to reduce the yield stress of
the slurries.    The Na2 HPO 4 in additive X was used to precipitate the Ca ions as
Ca 3 (PO 4 )2 . The reduction in the yield stress shown in Figure 7 showed that both
composite additives are just as effective. If one of these additives is to be used then it
will be the cost that will decide the additive that will be selected.

Mineral separation in layers
[0069] All slurries for the sedimentation and mineral separation investigation were set at
29 wt% solids. The untreated slurry did not show any sign of segregation of the various
mineral particles as indicated by the uniformity of the colour in the settled layer shown in
the image in Figure 8a.         Slurries treated with additive A (1:2 NaOH:Nan(PO)        17)
exhibited increased slurry settling rates.      The action of the composite additive in
separating the impurities from the iron particles was almost immediate. The treated
sediments were more compact with a much darker colour closely matching that of the
iron oxide.     It is believed that the sediment layers were rich in iron oxide.         The
supernatant layer was not completely clear possibly containing fine colloidal materials of
clay, goethite and others. Some of these particles do permeate through the compact
rich iron mineral layer and settle to the bottom of the container after prolonged standing.
Any platelet particles such as clay minerals once separated from the attachment to
other particles should settle much more slowly. This property can be exploited to
separate the slow settling platelet particles from the other mineral particles. Methods
commonly used to separate these particles from the others are hydrocyclone and
gravity sedimentation.
[0070] Similar sedimentation behaviours were observed with slurries treated with other
additives, E (16 wt% Nan(PO 3 )17), G (8.74 wt% 1:1 NaOH:Na 5 P3O 1o) and K (6.48 wt%
1:2 NaOH:Na 4P20 7) as shown in Figure 8b. The dosage of each additive is given in the
Figure.
[0071] The effect of the D additive (14.1 wt% 2:1 NaOH:Nan(PO)         17)  concentration on
the sedimentation behaviour was also evaluated. D additive contained lower or depleted
polyphosphate content, was used in the evaluation of the separation performance
because of its lower cost. The mass ratio of NaOH to Nan(PO 3 )1 7 is 2:1. Since the cost
of bulk polyphosphate is usually more than twice that of NaOH, this composite additive
can be cost effective to use.         The effect of D additive concentration on mineral
separation in slurries is shown in Figure 8c:

                  Composite additive concentration        Degree of separation
                   dwb% (2:1) NaOH:Nan(PO 3)1 7
                                 0                               none
                               0.024                             poor
                               0.06                              good
                                0.1                              good
                               0.101                             good
         Table 1: Mineral separation by 2:1 NaOH:Nan(PO)        17 composite additives
[0072] The one with no added additive is shown in comparison.               No clear separated
layer in the sediment was observed. Similarly for the lowest D concentration of 0.024
dwb% D, the settled layer height is tall and similar to that with no added additive.
Similarly, no clear separated layers were observed in the sediment. However at high D
additive concentration of 0.06 and 0.1 dwb%, the sediment layer is very short and the
colour is much darker brown suggesting the presence of iron oxide rich layer. The
supernatant is reddish in colour suggesting the presence of clay and goethite minerals.
A very thin light colour layer was observed on top suggesting this being the clay layer.
Conclusions:
[0073] In terms of mineral separation of the 29 wt% iron ore tailing slurries, the dosage
of the 1:0.5 NaOH-Nan(PO)       17  composite additives required is as low as 0.6kg per tonne
of tailing solids. All additives evaluated at high enough dosage bring about mineral
separation.
