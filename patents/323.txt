BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1.       Field of the Invention
         The present disclosure generally relates to chemical detection, and more particularly to a
wearable chemical threat detector which provides a user with an alert and/or instruction.
2.       Description of Related Art
         Chemical threat detection generally relates to the recognition of and alert to of any
number of known toxic chemical vapors in the environmental background. Military and
homeland security applications include the detection of chemical warfare agents and toxic
industrial chemicals used by enemy states or terrorists to intentionally harm military troops or
civilians abroad or in the U.S. Chemical munitions left behind from old conflicts routinely
present a chemical hazard to the military. The ability to detect toxic chemicals is important in a
variety of other contexts, including the detection of potentially toxic chemicals in a home,
business, or factory to prevent fire, injury, death, or health problems. The early detection of
chemical agents and toxic chemical vapors in general may provide an opportunity to warn
military personnel or the public in sufficient time to provide an opportunity for appropriate
evacuation, personal protection by donning protective equipment, or containment of the chemical
threat source.
         Typical chemical threat detectors are heavy and complex, thus making it difficult to
transport and deploy multiple devices in large groups. Furthermore, typical costs for chemical
threat detectors prohibit wide spread deployment to multiple users. Also, there is a tradeoff
between achieving sensitive chemical detection and producing accurate chemical detection
AM 59120631.1                                     1

results that reduce false positive rates. The conventional techniques have been considered
satisfactory for their intended purpose. However, there is an ever present need for an improved
wearable chemical threat detector.
3.       Summary of the Invention
        The present invention generally relates to chemical threat detection, and more specifically,
to a wearable chemical threat detector.
        In one aspect, the invention provides a method for chemical sensing and detection, which
includes the steps of (a) deploying a plurality of wearable chemical detectors, (b) receiving an
environmental air sample by at least one of the plurality of wearable chemical detectors, and (c)
receiving an alert of one or more chemicals present within the environmental air sample from at
least one wearable chemical detector. The method also includes (d) analyzing the alert for data
relating to at least one of a chemical name, a chemical concentration, a chemical category, or a
toxicity level, and (e) transmitting the data to a central data collection site.
        In certain embodiments, the method can also include receiving an instruction by at least
one wearable chemical threat detector for a user to follow. The instruction can relate to threat
detection.
        In some embodiments, the instruction can relate to an escape trajectory for exiting an
environment containing the detected chemical(s), or can triangulate and communicate a location
source of the detected chemical(s) from a plurality of wearable chemical threat detectors.
        Also, in some embodiments, the instruction can be received by more than one chemical
detector, the instruction can determine whether an alert of a detected chemical(s) is a false
                                                    2

positive, or the instruction can relate to an action to be performed by a user, such as a health
preventative action, for example donning a respirator.
        In another aspect, the present invention provides a system for detecting chemicals,
including a housing, a gas sampling chamber disposed within the housing, a sensor operatively
connected to or contained within the gas sampling chamber, and a power management system
disposed within the housing and operatively connected to the sensor. The system also includes a
controller operatively connected to the sensor. The detection system includes a processor, e.g., a
microprocessor, and a memory, e.g., a solid state memory. The memory stores instructions that,
when executed by the processor, cause the system to receive an environmental air sample within
the gas sampling chamber, receive an alert by the sensor of one or more chemicals detected
within the environmental air, analyze the alert for data relating to at least one of a chemical name,
a chemical concentration, a chemical category, or a toxicity level, and transmit the data to a
central data collection site.
        In some embodiments, the sensor can include an array of up to about 16 chemically
tailored nanosensors, and the array can be supported on a micro-electro-mechanical system
consisting of an electrical resistance transducer platform.
        Also, in certain embodiments, each nanosensor can have a surface coating (for example,
carbon nanotube, nanofiber, or nanowire technology, molecularly imprinted polymers, metal
organic frameworks or other nanoparticle technologies) enabling sensing of particular chemicals
or classes of chemicals disposed thereon.
        Advantageously, an electrochemical response (e.g., voltage or current) can be used as the
basis for sensor outputs.
                                                  3

        In certain embodiments, surface acoustic wave phenomena can be used as the basis for
sensor outputs. Equally, in certain embodiments, colorimetric phenomena can be used as the
basis for sensor outputs. In some embodiments, immunochemical (e.g., antibody - antigen)
phenomena can be used as the basis for sensor outputs.
        Advantageously, the system can also include an alert mechanism configured to provide a
status (for example, detected or not detected, chemical identity, concentration, hazard severity, or
the like) of detected chemical(s) present. The alert mechanism can be a visual indicator, an
audible indicator, or a vibratory indicator, and in certain embodiments, the alert mechanism can
provide the status of the detected chemical(s) present in real time.
        Additionally, in some embodiments, the system can further include a pump for
circulating environmental air samples into and out of the gas sampling chamber and/or a
graphical user interface operatively connected to the housing and the controller and configured to
display the information to a user.
        These and other features of the methods and systems of the subject invention will become
more readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of
preferred, non-exhaustive and non-limiting embodiments taken in conjunction with the drawings.

an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
5.       Description of Preferred Embodiments
         Reference will now be made to the drawings wherein like reference numerals identify
similar structural features or aspects of the subject disclosure. For purposes of explanation and
illustration, and not limitation, a partial view of an exemplary embodiment of the chemical
detection system in accordance with the disclosure is shown in Figs. 1A, 1B, and 2 and is
designated generally by reference character 100. Other embodiments of systems in accordance
with the disclosure, or aspects thereof, are provided in Fig. 4, as will be described. The systems
and methods described herein can be used to provide a warning, a triangulation of a source,
and/or an evacuation route to a user once a threat is detected.
         The term "user" as used herein includes, for example, a person or entity that owns a
computing device, wireless device, and/or chemical detector device; a person that operates or
utilizes said device(s); or a person or entity that is otherwise associated with said device(s). It is
contemplated that the term "user" is not intended to be limiting and may include various
examples beyond those described.
         As shown in Figs. 1A, 1B, and 2 the system 100 for chemical detection includes a
housing 102 and a gas sampling chamber 104 disposed within the housing 102. The gas sampling
                                                   5

chamber 104 has an opening 106 therein which exposes the gas sampling chamber 104 to the
ambient air environment. Exposure of the gas sampling chamber 104 to the environment via the
opening 106 allows environmental gases (e.g., air, other gases, and/or chemical vapors) to enter
the gas sampling chamber 104. As shown in Fig. 3, the system 100 also includes a sensor 108.
The sensor 108 includes an array of up to 16 chemically tailored nanosensors 109. In certain
embodiments, the nanosensors 109 may be supported on a platform 111. Each nanosensor 109
includes a chemically-specific surface coating that interacts with a particular target gas or vapor.
When a particular nanosensor 109 interacts with a specific chemical, the electrical resistance of
said nanosensor is altered by either an increase or decrease. When a particular nanosensor 109
reacts to a specific target gas (while other nanosensors may not react) the electrical resistance of
the nanosensor 109 may change in a predictable manner as a result of the gas-sensor interaction.
Response signals may be evaluated by a suite of algorithms that process and interpret each
nanosensor's 109 response characteristics to provide autonomous, real-time, and continuous
detection and identification of target gases. In certain embodiments, the algorithms include pre
processing, hit detection, classification, identification, and/or concentration measurement. The
algorithms process and interpret nanosensor 109 response characteristics to provide autonomous
and continuous, near-real-time detection of the desired target gases/vapors, e.g., to detect at least
one chemical from a selected set of possible chemicals.
        Returning to Figs. 1A, 1B, and 2, the system further includes a power management
system 110, and a controller 112. The sensor 108 is operatively connected to the gas sampling
chamber 104. The power management system 110 is disposed within the housing 102 and is
operatively connected to the sensor 108.
                                                  6

         The controller 112 is operatively connected to the sensor 108. The controller 112 includes
at least one central processing unit (CPU) 114 and one or more memory integrated circuits (ICs)
116. The memory IC 116 stores instructions that, when executed by the CPU 114, cause the
system 100 to receive an environmental air sample within the gas sampling chamber 104, receive
an alert by the sensor 108 of a detected chemical(s) present within the ambient environmental air,
and analyze the alert for data relating to at least one of a chemical name, a chemical
concentration, a chemical category, or a toxicity level. The instructions stored by the memory
ICs 116, when executed by the CPU 114, further cause the system 100 to transmit the data to a
central data collection site.
         The controller 112 also includes support circuits (or /O) 118. The CPU 114 may be one
of any form of computer processors that are used in industrial settings for controlling various
processes and hardware (e.g., motors or other hardware) and monitor the processes (e.g., air
sample within the gas sampling chamber, sensor, data, etc.). The memory 116 is connected to the
CPU 114, and may be one or more of a readily available memory, such as random access
memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), or any other form of digital storage, local or remote.
Software instructions and data can be coded and stored within the memory 116 for instructing
CPU 114. The support circuits 118 are also connected to the CPU 114 for supporting the CPU
114 in a conventional manner. The support circuits 118 may include conventional cache, power
supplies, clock circuits, input/output circuitry, subsystems, and the like. A program (or computer
instructions) readable by the controller 112 implements the method described herein (infra)
and/or determines which tasks are performable. The program may be software readable by the
controller 112 and may include code to monitor and control, for example, environmental air
sample intake, alerts, data, transmissions, etc. In certain embodiments, the controller 112 may be
                                                   7

a PC microcontroller. The controller 112 may also automate the sequence of the process
performed, and/or the modes performed, by the system for chemical detection.
        In certain embodiments, the system 100 further includes a pump 120 (shown in phantom)
disposed therein. In some embodiments, the pump 120 is operatively connected to the gas
sampling chamber 104. The pump 120 may circulate an environmental air sample into and/or out
of the gas sampling chamber 104. As such, the pump 120 may operate to continuously draw
ambient environmental air across the sensor in order to expose the nanosensor array to the
ambient air. In certain embodiments, a temperature and/or humidity sensor are also disposed
within the housing 102 in order to monitor local conditions and provide feedback to the
algorithms such that local environmental conditions may be compensated for. Furthermore, in
some embodiments, a clip 130 may be operatively connected to the housing 102. The clip 130
may allow a user to attach the system 100 to their belt, other equipment, or the like.
        In some embodiments, the system 100 operates autonomously and/or continuously while
providing real-time sensor signal outputs. Sensor signal outputs may include an alert provided by
an alert mechanism 122. The alert mechanism 122 is configured to provide a status of detected
chemical(s) present to a user. The alert mechanism 122 may be a visual indicator, an audible
indicator, or a vibratory indicator, among other indicators known in the art. In some
embodiments, the alert mechanism 122 may be a graphical user interface, such as graphical user
interface 124 shown in Fig. 1, while in other embodiments the alert mechanism 122 may be a
light, such as LED lights 126 in Fig. 2. The graphical user interface 124 may be operatively
connected to the housing 102 and the controller 112. The graphical user interface 124 is
configured to display information to the user.
                                                 8

        The alert mechanism 122 provides the status of the detected chemical(s) present in real
time to the user. Furthermore, in some embodiments as discussed infra, the alert mechanism 122
may provide evacuation instructions to a user, may triangulate the source and/or location of the
chemical to the user, may provide safety instructions to the user (e.g., relating to the use of
required safety equipment), and/or may alert the user to the chemical name, the chemical
concentration, the chemical category, and/or the chemical toxicity level.
        Figure 4 illustrates a schematic flow diagram of a method 400 for chemical sensing. At
operation 410, a plurality of wearable chemical detectors are deployed. In certain embodiments,
the deployment may be outside, while in other embodiments the deployment may be indoors.
Deployment may include equipping a user, or multiple users, with a wearable chemical detector.
        At operation 420, an environmental air sample is received by at least one of the plurality
of wearable chemical detectors. As discussed supra, environmental air may be circulated into
and out of the gas sampling chamber via the pump. A sensor disposed within the wearable
chemical detector may determine the presence and concentration of one or more chemicals,
toxic gases, or the like.
        At operation 430, an alert of a detected chemical(s) present within the environmental air
sample is received by at least one wearable portable chemical detector. The alert may be in one
of various forms. In some embodiments, the alert may be a visual alert via, for example, an LED
or a graphical user interface, while in other embodiments, the alert may be an audible alert. In
some embodiments, the alert may be vibratory or any other suitable alert scheme.
        At operation 440, the alert is analyzed for data relating to at least one of a chemical name,
a chemical concentration, a chemical category, and/or a toxicity level. In certain embodiments,
the analyzed data may be disposed on the graphical user interface.
                                                  9

        At operation 450, the data is transmitted to a central data collection site. The central data
collection site may be a server, a hard drive, a computer, or the like that is onsite or offsite. In
certain embodiments, any of operation 410, operation 420, operation 430, operation 440, and/or
operation 450 may be repeated until a detected chemical is no longer detected. As such, each
wearable chemical detector may operate autonomously and/or continuously to provide real-time
sensor signal outputs and/or instructions to the user.
        In some embodiments, the method 400 further includes receiving an instruction by at
least one wearable chemical detector, wherein the instruction is for a user to follow. The
instruction may relate to threat detection. A threat may be detected when one or more
chemical(s) is/are in the environmental air sample received by at least one of the wearable
chemical detectors. The threat may make it unsafe for a user to be in the area without proper
personal safety protections.
        Furthermore, the instruction may relate to an escape trajectory for exiting an environment
containing the detected chemical(s). As such, the instruction may guide the user, via a visual
indication or an audible indication, to an escape path for safely leaving the contaminated area. In
other embodiments, the instruction may triangulate and communicate the location source of the
detected chemical(s) from a plurality of the wearable chemical detectors. For example, when
multiple wearable chemical detectors are being utilized in approximately the same general area,
each portable chemical detector is configured to communicate with one another. The
communication may occur via a peer-to-peer network, over internet connection, via Bluetooth
connection, or the like. Detector communication may be facilitated by mobile telephones, radios,
or the like, that the user is also wearing. Each communicating wearable chemical detector may
communicate information relating to, for example, chemical concentrations measured. Such
                                                  10

communications may allow the source or location of the detected chemical(s) to be determined,
for example by triangulation, such that the threat can be eliminated. In certain embodiments, the
instruction may relate to an action to be performed by a user. In some embodiments, the action
may be a health preventative action, such as an instruction for the user to wear a protective
respirator, protective clothing, or the like. For example, each wearable chemical detector may
receive the instruction in order to direct the respective user away from the area of the detected
chemical(s) or, in certain instances, to direct the respective user toward the source or plume of
the detected chemical(s). In some embodiments, the instruction may communicate to the user
whether the alert of a detected chemical is a false positive.
         The methods and systems of the present disclosure, as described above and shown in the
drawings, provide for an improved wearable chemical threat detector with superior properties
including lighter overall weight, reduced production costs, increased detection speed, more
reliable chemical identification and concentration determination, user instructions, improved
usability, and reduced power consumption.
         While the apparatus and methods of the subject disclosure have been shown and
described with reference to preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate
that changes and/or modifications may be made thereto without departing from the scope of the
subject disclosure.
         Finally, it should also be noted that the terms 'including' and 'comprising' are being used
in this specification interchangeably.
