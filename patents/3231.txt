             Method, composition, kit and system for isolating amplifiable nucleic acid from
specimens preserved in a liquid-based cytology preservative that contains formaldehyde.
The technique relies on the use of 2-imidazolidone and a protease enzyme, such as

             [00011 The entire disclosure of US application 61/946,637 filed February 28, 2014 is
incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.
             [0001a]                The entire disclosure in the complete specification of our Australian
patent application no. 2014384731 is by this cross-reference incorporated into the present
specification.
                                                      Field of the Invention
             [00021 The present invention relates to the field of biotechnology.               More
particularly, the invention relates to methods of isolating nucleic acid from samples fixed in
a formaldehyde-containing liquid-based cytology preservative, where isolated RNA is
suitable for use as a template in nucleic acid amplification procedures.
                                                  Background of the Invention
             [00031 Laboratory personnel engaged in molecular analysis of nucleic acid isolated
from formaldehyde-fixed samples appreciate that certain restrictions apply to the use of
this sample type.                   This is because formaldehyde, and certain other chemical fixatives,
chemically modify proteins and nucleic acids.                      These modifications are known to
compromise the utility of nucleic acid in subsequent analyses.
             [0004] Particular difficulties result from the well-known chemical modification of
DNA, RNA and proteins.                      Indeed, Masuda et al., (Nucleic Acids Res., 27:4436-4443 (1999))
investigated the reason formalin-fixed samples are poor materials for molecular biological
applications.                The authors demonstrated that, while treatment with proteinase K
solubilized fixed tissues and enabled RNA extraction, the extracted RNA was of only limited
use as a PCR template.                    Further investigation revealed chemical addition of mono-methylol
groups (-CH 2OH) to all four bases, as well as evidence for adenine dimerization through
methylene bridging.                    Certain modifications could be reversed by elevating the temperature
in formalin-free buffer.                   However, the instability of RNA can make the use of high
                                                                -1

temperature conditions undesirable.
              [00051 Earlier approaches for treating formaldehyde-fixed samples have met with
some success.                   For example, Khripin et al., in published U.S. Patent Application
2011/0196146 Al described the use of hydrazine- and hydrazide-containing
formaldehyde-scavenging compounds during isolation of nucleic acids from cellular material
disposed in a liquid-based cytology preservative containing formaldehyde (e.g.,
semicarbazide; thiosemicarbazide; carbazide; thiocarbazide; N-aminoguanidine and a salt
thereof, including hydrochloride salts; N,N-diaminoguanidine and a salt thereof, including
dihydrochloride salts; acetylhydrazide; adipic acid dihydrazide; succinic acid dihydrazide;
formic hydrazide; maleic acid dihydrazide; malonic acid dihydrazide;
benzenesulfonylhydrazide; tosylhydrazide; methylsulfonylhydrazide).                         Rather than
employing nucleic acid amplification as a measure of nucleic acid integrity, the inventors
employed a hybrid capture protocol wherein a cocktail of RNA probes hybridized to isolated
nucleic acid.               This was followed by antibody binding to the RNA:DNA hybrids, and a
subsequent signal amplification procedure to determine the presence of DNA target nucleic
acids.         Indeed, Khripin et al., refer to U.S. 6,228,578 for instructing nucleic acid detection,
where that reference describes treatment of nucleic acid samples under conditions of
strong alkali and high temperature - conditions known to hydrolyze RNA.                         Thus, Khripin et
al., do not address rendering nucleic acids suitable for use as templates in nucleic acid
amplification reactions, nor present sufficient disclosure to allow detection of RNA targets
from formaldehyde-fixed specimens.
              [0006] The techniques disclosed herein address the need for rapid and efficient
isolation of intact nucleic acid, such as RNA, from specimens preserved in
formaldehyde-containing liquid-based cytology preservatives.
              [0006a]            It is to be understood that if any prior art publication is referred to herein,
such reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms a part of the
common general knowledge in the art in Australia or any other country.
                                              Summary of the Claimed Invention
              [0007] In one aspect, the invention relates to a method of processing a specimen
that includes a clinical sample disposed in a liquid-based cytology preservative that contains
                                                              -2

formaldehyde.                   The method begins with the step of combining the specimen with a
protease enzyme and 2-imidazolidone or other formaldehyde scavenger to create a reaction
mixture.            This is followed by incubating the reaction mixture at an elevated temperature
for a period of time sufficient to reverse chemical modifications by formaldehyde of nucleic
acid that may be contained in the specimen.                   By this step, at least some of the chemical
modifications caused by reaction between formaldehyde and either nucleic acids or
proteins are reversed.                  For example, chemical crosslinks may be broken.       Next there is a
step for isolating a nucleic acid from the reaction mixture after the incubating step.
Finally, there is a step for performing an in vitro amplification reaction using the nucleic acid
from the isolating step as templates.
              [00081           In some methods, the reversing releases nucleic acids in the specimen from
formaldehyde-induced crosslinking to polypeptides in the specimen.                      In some methods,
the protease frees the nucleic acids from the formaldehyde-induced crosslinking and
2-imidazolidone inhibits induction of new cross-links between nucleic acids and
polypeptides in the sample.
              [00091           In some methods, the sample has been disposed in the liquid-based
cytology preservative for 7-120 days before performing step (a).
              [0010]          In some methods, the incubating step is for no more than 30 minutes or the
incubating step is between about 5 minutes and 30 minutes or the incubating step is for no
more than 15 min.
              [0011]           In some methods, the yield of amplified nucleic acid after step (d) is higher
than in control amplifications omitting either the proteinase or 2-imidazolidone. In some
methods, the yield of amplified nucleic acid after step (d) is at least 10 % higher than either
of control amplifications omitting either proteinase or 2-imidazolidone.                   In some methods,
at least 90% of the nucleic acid molecules in the sample are free of the cross-links after the
incubating step.
              [0012] In some methods, final concentration of 2-imidazolidone before the
incubation step is 1 to 5 or 2-5 fold by moles greater than final maximum concentration of
the formaldehyde.                   In some methods, the proteinase is proteinase-K present at a
concentration of 4.3 to 43 U/ml.                 In some methods, the temperature of the incubating step
is about 60-100* C. In some methods, the temperature of the incubating step is 85-95*C.
                                                           -3
10072052_1 (GHMatters) P104017.AU.1

In some methods, the temperature of the incubating step is 91-95* C.                   In some methods,
the temperature of the incubating step is 90* C.
              [0013]           In some methods, the proteinase and formaldehyde scavenger are
combined simultaneously with the specimen.                     In some methods, the proteinase is
combined with the specimen before formaldehyde scavenger.                       In some methods, the
formaldehyde scavenger is combined with the specimen before the proteinase.
              [00141           In some methods, the amplification is a transcription mediated
amplification, single-primer nucleic acid amplification, nucleic acid sequence-based
amplification, polymerase chain Reaction, strand displacement amplification, self-sustained
sequence replication or DNA ligase chain reaction. In some methods, the nucleic acids
comprise DNA and in some methods RNA.                     In some methods, the isolated nucleic acid is
DNA and in some methods RNA.
              [0015] In some methods, the nucleic acid is isolated by a capture assay with a
capture probe hybridizing to the nucleic acid to be isolated and to an immobilized probe.
In some methods, the immobilized probe is immobilized to a magnetic bead.
              [00161 In some methods, the assay positivity of amplified nucleic acid is higher than
assay positivity of amplified nucleic acids obtained from reaction mixture omitting either
proteinase or the formaldehyde scavenger.                   In some methods, the assay positivity of
amplified nucleic acid is at least about 12% higher than assay positivity of amplified nucleic
acids obtained from reaction mixture omitting either proteinase or 2-imidazolidone.                      In
some methods, the assay positivity of amplified nucleic acid after step (d) is about 95% after
21 days.
              [0017] In some methods, the isolated nucleic acid is human papillomavirus (HPV)
RNA target nucleic acid.                In some methods, the specimen is a cervical cell specimen.
              [0018] In another aspect, the invention relates to a composition of matter that
includes the following components:                  2-imidazolidone; proteinase K; EDTA; and a pH buffer.
              [0019] In another aspect, the invention relates to a kit for processing a specimen
preserved in a liquid-based cytology preservative that contains formaldehyde.                    The kit
includes a first vial containing a lyophilized proteinase K enzyme.                As well, the kit includes a
second vial containing a reconstitution buffer for reconstituting the lyophilized proteinase K
enzyme.             This reconstitution buffer includes an amount of a pH buffer, an amount of EDTA,
                                                          -4

and an amount of 2-imidazolidone.
              [00201 In another aspect, the invention relates to a system for processing nucleic
acid-containing samples preserved in a liquid-based cytology preservative that contains
formaldehyde.                   The system components include: a programmable controller; a pipetting
device in communication with the programmable controller; a first holder for a reaction vial;
and a second holder for a reagent vial.                In accordance with this aspect of the invention, the
programmable controller is configured by software instructions to cause the pipetting
device to transfer an aliquot of liquid from the reagent vial to the reaction vial when the
reagent vial contains a solution comprising 2-imidazolidone, proteinase K, EDTA, and a pH
buffer. As well as these components, the reaction vial can contain a specimen preserved in
formaldehyde as further described below introduced before or after the other components.
The same or other pipetting device can be used for introducing the specimen into the
reaction vial, optionally with the programmable controller being configured by software to
cause such pipetting device to operate.                 The system can also include a heater for heating
the reaction vial and its contents for a controlled period of time, optionally subject to the
control of the programmable controller configure by suitable software.

              [0027] Unless otherwise described, scientific and technical terms used herein have
the same meaning as commonly understood by those skilled in the art of molecular biology
based on technical literature, e.g., Dictionary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, 2nd
ed. (Singleton et al., 1994, John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY), or other well-known technical
publications related to molecular biology.                    Unless otherwise described, techniques
employed or contemplated herein are standard methods well known in the art of molecular
biology.
              [0028] All patents, applications, published applications and other publications

in this section is contrary to or otherwise inconsistent with a definition set forth in the
patents, applications, published applications and other publications that are herein
incorporated by reference, the definition set forth in this section prevails over the definition
that is incorporated herein by reference.
              [0029] As used herein, "a" or "an" means "at least one" or "one or more."
              [0029a]               In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except
where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the
word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive
                                                               -6

sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or
addition of further features in various embodiments of the invention.
              [0030] Approximating language, as used herein throughout the specification and
claims, may be applied to modify any quantitative or qualitative representation that could
permissibly vary without resulting in a change in the basic function to which it is related.
Accordingly, a value modified by a term such as "about" or "approximately" is not to be
limited to the precise value specified, and may include values that differ from the specified
value.
              [00311 For clarification, "formaldehyde," in its basic form (CH2 O), is a gas.  The
liquid called "formalin" is actually a mixture of formaldehyde gas and water.             However, as
used herein, "formaldehyde" can refer to the molecule (CH2O) that is dissolved in an
aqueous solution.
              [0032] As used herein, "liquid-based cytology" refers to liquid-based gynecologic
specimen collection, wherein a sample for cervicovaginal testing collected in the
conventional manner with one of the brush instruments but, instead of being spread onto a
glass slide, it is transferred to a vial of liquid preservative or "fixative."    The preserved
specimen can be used for microscopy or molecular analysis.
              [0033] As used herein, a "specimen" is something collected as an example of a
particular kind of thing.           Biological specimens include any tissue or material derived from a
living or dead organism that may contain an analyte, such as a nucleic acid analyte.
Preferred biological specimens include respiratory tissue, exudates (e.g., bronchoalveolar
lavage), biopsy, sputum, peripheral blood, plasma, serum, lymph node, gastrointestinal
tissue, feces, urine, or other fluids, tissues or materials.       Highly preferred biological
specimens include cells collected from the outer opening of the cervix, as may be obtained
in connection with PAP testing.
              [0034] As used herein, the term "sample" refers to a portion or quantity of material
for use in testing, where that portion can be informative about the thing from which it was
taken.          Samples may be from any source, such as biological specimens or environmental
sources.
              [0035] As used herein, the term "nucleic acid" refers to a polynucleotide compound,
which includes oligonucleotides, comprising nucleosides or nucleoside analogs that have
                                                      -7

nitrogenous heterocyclic bases or base analogs, covalently linked by standard
phosphodiester bonds or other linkages.                   Nucleic acids include RNA, DNA, chimeric
DNA-RNA polymers or analogs thereof.
              [0036] By "analyte nucleic acid" is meant a polynucleotide of interest that is to be
detected or quantified.               The genome of a particular virus would exemplify an analyte
nucleic acid.
              [00371 As used herein, a "test sample" is any sample to be investigated for the
presence of a particular analyte nucleic acid.
              [00381 As used herein, "elevated" temperature conditions refer to a temperature
higher than room temperature.                  Preferably, elevated temperatures are in the range of
from 60'C-1000 C, more preferably in the range of from 650 C-950 C, sometimes in the range
of from 80 0 C-90 0 C, sometimes 81-98'C, 85-98 0 C, 85-95'C, 90-95C, 91-95 0 C or 91-99C, and
sometimes about 90 0 C. Use of temperatures above 80C, e.g., 85 -98 0 C, 90 0 C, or 91-95 C
can result in increased assay sensitivity as further defined below, which is surprising
because proteinase K undergo increasing denaturation as the temperature is increased over
65'C, and would not normally be recommended for use at temperatures above 85 0 C or
90'C because of excessive denaturation.                   Although practice of the invention is not
dependent on discerning the mechanism for this unexpected benefit from higher
temperatures, this result may indicate that promotion of 2-imidazolidone scavenging of
formaldehyde at the elevated temperature more than compensates for some reduction in
proteinase K activity.              Preferably, in all of these instances, reaction mixtures including a
clinical sample in liquid-based cytology preservative, 2-imidazolidone, protease, EDTA and
pH buffer are exposed to elevated temperatures for a period of time from 10 minutes to 30
minutes, and preferably from 10 minutes to not more than 20 minutes, and sometimes for
up to 15 minutes or about 15 minutes.
              [0039] An "amplicon" is a polynucleotide product of an in vitro nucleic acid
amplification reaction, wherein a target nucleic acid sequence served as the template for
synthesis of copies or amplification products.
              [0040] By "target" or "target nucleic acid" is meant a nucleic acid containing a
sequence that is to be amplified, detected and/or quantified.                  A target nucleic acid
sequence that is to be amplified preferably are positioned between two oppositely disposed
                                                            -8

oligonucleotides, and includes the portion of the target nucleic acid that is complementary
to each of the oligonucleotides.
              [0041] By "amplification" or "nucleic acid amplification" or "in vitro nucleic acid
amplification" and the like is meant any known procedure for obtaining multiple copies,
allowing for RNA and DNA equivalents, of a target nucleic acid sequence or its complement
or fragments thereof.
              [00421 To aid in understanding of some of the embodiments disclosed herein, the
TMA method that has been described in detail previously (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,399,491,
5,554,516 and 5,824,518) is briefly summarized.                  In TMA, a target nucleic acid that
contains the sequence to be amplified is provided as single stranded nucleic acid (e.g.,
ssRNA or ssDNA).                    Any conventional method of converting a double stranded nucleic acid
(e.g., dsDNA) to a single-stranded nucleic acid may be used.                 A promoter primer binds
specifically to the target nucleic acid at its target sequence and a reverse transcriptase (RT)
extends the 3' end of the promoter primer using the target strand as a template to create a
cDNA copy, resulting in a RNA:cDNA duplex.                   RNase activity (e.g., RNase H of RT enzyme)
digests the RNA of the RNA:cDNA duplex and a second primer binds specifically to its target
sequence in the cDNA, downstream from the promoter-primer end.                        Then RT synthesizes a
new DNA strand by extending the 3' end of the second primer using the cDNA as a template
to create a dsDNA that contains a functional promoter sequence.                     RNA polymerase specific
for the functional promoter initiates transcription to produce about 100 to 1000 RNA
transcripts (amplified copies or amplicons) complementary to the initial target strand.                  The
second primer binds specifically to its target sequence in each amplicon and RT creates a
cDNA from the amplicon RNA template to produce a RNA:cDNA duplex.                        RNase digests the
amplicon RNA from the RNA:cDNA duplex and the target-specific sequence of the promoter
primer binds to its complementary sequence in the newly synthesized DNA and RT extends
the 3' end of the promoter primer as well as the 3' end of the cDNA to create a dsDNA that
contains a functional promoter to which the RNA polymerase binds and transcribes
additional amplicons that are complementary to the target strand.                    Autocatalytic cycles
that use these steps repeatedly during the reaction produce about a billion-fold
amplification of the initial target sequence.              Amplicons may be detected during
amplification (real-time detection) or at an end point of the reaction (end-point detection)

by using a probe that binds specifically to a sequence contained in the amplicons.
Detection of a signal resulting from the bound probes indicates the presence of the target
nucleic acid in the sample.
              [0043] As used herein, "detection" of the amplified products may be accomplished
by using any known method.                   For example, the amplified nucleic acids may be associated
with a surface that results in a detectable physical change (e.g., an electrical change).
Amplified nucleic acids may be detected in solution phase or by concentrating them in or on
a matrix and detecting labels associated with them (e.g., an intercalating agent such as
ethidium bromide).                  Other detection methods use probes complementary to a sequence in
the amplified product and detect the presence of the probe:product complex, or use a
complex of probes to amplify the signal detected from amplified products (e.g., U.S. Pat.
Nos. 5,424,413, 5,451,503 and 5,849,481). Other detection methods use a probe in which
signal production is linked to the presence of the target sequence because a change in
signal results only when the labeled probe binds to amplified product, such as in a
molecular beacon, molecular torch, or hybridization switch probe (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos.
5,118,801, 5,312,728, 5,925,517, 6,150,097, 6,361,945, 6,534,274, 6,835,542, 6,849,412 and
8,034,554; and U.S. Pub. No. 2006/0194240 Al).                  Such probes typically use a label (e.g.,
fluorophore) attached to one end of the probe and an interacting compound (e.g.,
quencher) attached to another location of the probe to inhibit signal production from the
label when the probe is in one conformation ("closed") that indicates it is not hybridized to
amplified product, but a detectable signal is produced when the probe is hybridized to the
amplified product which changes its conformation (to "open").                  Detection of a signal from
directly or indirectly labeled probes that specifically associate with the amplified product
indicates the presence of the target nucleic acid that was amplified.
              [0044] As used herein, a "probe" is an oligonucleotide that hybridizes specifically to
a target sequence in a nucleic acid, preferably in an amplified nucleic acid, under conditions
that promote hybridization, to form a detectable hybrid.
              [0045] As used herein, the term "contacting" means bringing two or more
components together.                  Contacting can be achieved by mixing all the components in a fluid
or semi-fluid mixture.                Contacting can also be achieved when one or more components are
brought into physical contact with one or more other components on a solid surface such as

a solid tissue section or a substrate.
             [00461 As used herein, the term "target capture" refers to selectively separating a
target nucleic acid from other components of a sample mixture, such as cellular fragments,
organelles, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, or other nucleic acids.               A target capture system
may be specific and selectively separate a predetermined target nucleic acid from other
sample components (e.g., by using a nucleic acid sequence specific to the intended target
nucleic acid), or it may be nonspecific and selectively separate a target nucleic acid from
other sample components by using other characteristics of the target (e.g., a physical trait
of the target nucleic acid that distinguishes it from other sample components which do not
exhibit that physical characteristic, such as hybridization to a non-specific nucleic acid,
binding to a porous glass bead, capture and elution in a silica packed column).                  Preferred
nucleic acid hybridization target capture methods and compositions have been previously
described in detail (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,750,338, 6,060,246, 6,110,678, 6,534,273 and 7993,853;
and US Pub. No. 2008/0286775 Al).                     Preferred target capture embodiments use a target
capture oligonucleotide in solution phase and an immobilized capture probe attached to a
support to form a complex with the target nucleic acid and separate the captured target
from other components.
             [0047] As used herein, the term "target capture oligonucleotide" refers to at least
one nucleic acid oligonucleotide that bridges or joins a target nucleic acid and an
immobilized capture probe by using binding pair members, such as complementary nucleic
acid sequences or biotin and streptavidin.                  In one approach, the target capture
oligonucleotide binds nonspecifically to the target nucleic acid and immobilizes it to a solid
support.            In a different approach, a target specific (TS) sequence of the target capture
oligonucleotide binds specifically to a sequence in the target nucleic acid.                In both
approaches the target capture oligonucleotide includes an immobilized capture
probe-binding region that binds to an immobilized capture probe (e.g., by specific binding
pair interaction).                  In embodiments in which the TS sequence and the immobilized capture
probe-binding region are both nucleic acid sequences, they may be covalently joined to
each other, or may be on different oligonucleotides joined by one or more linkers.
             [0048] An "immobilized capture probe" provides a means for joining a target
capture oligonucleotide to a solid support.                  The immobilized capture probe is a base

sequence recognition molecule joined to the solid support, which facilitates separation of
bound target polynucleotide from unbound material.                    Any known solid support may be
used, such as matrices and particles free in solution.               For example, solid supports may be
nitrocellulose, nylon, glass, polyacrylate, mixed polymers, polystyrene, silane polypropylene
and, preferably, magnetically attractable particles.                Particularly preferred supports include
magnetic spheres that are monodisperse (i.e., uniform in size ± about 5%), thereby
providing consistent results, which is particularly advantageous for use in an automated
assay.         The immobilized capture probe may be joined directly (e.g., via a covalent linkage
or ionic interaction), or indirectly to the solid support.             Common examples of useful solid
supports include magnetic particles or beads.
              [00491 As used herein, the term "separating" or "purifying" generally refers to
removal of one or more components of a mixture, such as a sample, from one or more
other components in the mixture.                 Sample components include nucleic acids in a generally
aqueous solution phase, which may include cellular fragments, proteins, carbohydrates,
lipids, and other compounds.                Preferred embodiments separate or remove at least 70% to
80%, and more preferably about 95%, of the target nucleic acid from other components in
the mixture.
              [0050] By "kit" is meant a packaged combination of materials, typically intended for
use in conjunction with each other.                 Kits in accordance with the invention may include
instructions or other information in a "tangible" form (e.g., printed information,
electronically recorded on a computer-readable medium, or otherwise recorded on a
machine-readable medium such as a bar code for storing numerical values).
              [0051] By "consisting essentially of" is meant that additional component(s),
composition(s) or method step(s) that do not materially change the basic and novel
characteristics of the present invention may be included in the present invention.                 Any
component(s), composition(s), or method step(s) that have a material effect on the basic
and novel characteristics of the present invention would fall outside of this term.

                                                     Detailed Description
              [0054] Disclosed herein are methods, systems, compositions and kits for isolating
nucleic acid from specimens preserved in liquid-based cytology preservatives containing
formaldehyde.                   Briefly, the disclosed approach relies on contacting an aliquot of the
sample, meaning the cellular sample disposed in the liquid preservative, with a combination
of 2-imidazolidone and a protease enzyme.                      In a highly preferred embodiment, the
protease is the proteinase K enzyme.                     The mixture can then be incubated under conditions
of high heat to inactivate free formaldehyde and reverse at least a portion of the chemical
modifications of nucleic acid caused by formaldehyde.                      The approach advantageously is
rapid compared to prior methods, and results in nucleic acid, including RNA, that can be
efficiently isolated (e.g., by capture probe hybridization), reverse transcribed (if desired) and
amplified in vitro.
Introduction and Overview
              [0055] The techniques disclosed herein facilitate detection of nucleic acid targets
that may be present in biological samples contained in liquid-based cytology preservatives
that include formaldehyde. Such biological samples can be stored for substantial periods
before undergoing analysis (e.g., at least 1, 2, 7, 14, 30, 50 or 100 days, or 7-120 days).
During storage, formaldehyde can induce modifications of the nucleic acids in the sample,
particularly generation of cross-links with polypeptides present in the sample.                   These
modification inhibit subsequent processing of the DNA including its ability to hybridize (e.g.,
to a capture probe), or be amplified.                   Modifications, including cross-links can be broken by
a treatment with a protease, such as proteinase K. Treatment with a protease can
increase the molecules of nucleic acid available for capture and/or amplification and
ultimately yield more amplification product and/or a lower threshold of detection of a
particular target.                  These beneficial effects of protease are increased by concurrent
treatment of the sample with 2-imidazolidone.                      The 2-imidazolidone acts as a
formaldehyde scavenger, i.e., it reacts with formaldehyde in such a way as to render it
                                                             -13
10072052_1 (GHMatters) P104017.AU.1

incapable or at least of substantially diminished ability to induce crosslinks between nucleic
acids and polypeptides.             Although 2-imidazolidone is used as an exemplary and preferred
formaldehyde scavenger in much of the description that follows, other formaldehyde
scavengers, such as those described in the Background can alternatively be used, and
particularly so in embodiments performed at a temperature of 85'C or higher unless the
context requires otherwise. By removing reactive formaldehyde, the 2-imidazolidone can
inhibit polypeptides including polypeptides released by action of the protease from forming
or reforming cross-links with nucleic acids in the sample.             The 2-imidazolidone by removing
formaldehyde can also protect the protease from inactivation.                 Although 2-imidazolidone
has previously been reported to be a formaldehyde scavenger, it is surprising that its
potential inhibition of formation of new cross-links for a short period of incubation results in
material improved availability of nucleic acids for capture, amplification and subsequent
processing considering the long period of time for which samples may be stored and cross
links can be formed before protease and 2-imidazolidone are supplied.                 It is also surprising
that presence of 2-imidazolidone does not itself impair the ability of nucleic acids to
undergo capture, amplification or other nucleic acid hybridization event because some
imidazolines are known nucleic acid denaturants.
              [0056] The methods can be used on any form of nucleic acid including DNA and
RNA.          DNA can be genomic or cDNA among others.             RNA can be mRNA, rRNA, hnRNA,
tRNA, or viral RNA among others.              While DNA may be the desired analyte, RNA presents
more stringent requirements for sample processing due to its chemical instability, including
instability at high temperatures.           Thus, procedures for isolating RNA were pursued for
demonstrating the new method of sample preparation under the most rigorous conditions.
              [0057] A model system for gynecologic specimen collection using a
formaldehyde-containing liquid-based cytology preservative was employed to illustrate the
nucleic acid isolation technique.           In its practical application, this system involves first
obtaining a swab of cervical cells, transferring the obtained sample of cells to SUREPATH (a
registered trademark of TriPath Imaging, Inc.) liquid-based cytology preservative, and then
processing the preserved cells for subsequent molecular testing.                The molecular testing in
this instance required in vitro amplification and detection of human papillomavirus (HPV)
RNA target nucleic acids.
                                                       -14

              [00581 HPV is associated with the development of cervical cancer, and that
detection of expressed HPV RNA has particular value as a diagnostic and monitoring assay.
Indeed, HPV molecular testing in conjunction with cytology is now recommended for
cervical cancer screening and patient management.                Accordingly, it was reasoned that
liquid Pap testing would be one example of an assay system that would benefit from
enhancing recovery of amplifiable RNA by improved processing of samples preserved in
formalin, or other liquid-based cytology preservatives containing formaldehyde.
Moreover, automated testing procedures based on amplification nucleic acid in vitro
followed by detection of HPV-specific amplification products would benefit as well.
              [0059] The APTIMA® HPV genetic probe assay is a commercially available multiplex
nucleic acid test that detects E6/E7 mRNA from 14 high-risk HPV genotypes (e.g., cat. no.
303585, Gen-Probe Incorporated, San Diego, CA).               Among the genotypes detected are HPV
16, HPV 18, and HPV 45.             This assay, which relies on target capture using a nucleic acid
hybridization approach, has been demonstrated for use with cervical specimens preserved
in THIN PREP® liquid-based cytology preservative that does not include formaldehyde.                The
genetic probe assay also has been demonstrated for use with specimens preserved in
SUREPATH* liquid-based cytology reagent after being first combined with a specimen
transport medium (STM), and then treated with a reagent that includes relatively high levels
of proteinase K enzyme (180 U/reaction).             SUREPATH* liquid-based cytology preservative
contains formaldehyde, ethanol, methanol, and isopropanol.                Whereas specimens
preserved in THINPREP can be processed rapidly for testing by the APTIMA® HPV genetic
probe assay, specimens preserved in SUREPATH* require digestion with proteinase K for
two hours at 650 C. This requirement compromises the utility of the latter preservative.
By the improved method described below, specimens preserved in SUREPATH® liquid-based
cytology reagent can be processed using less enzyme reagent and an incubation time of
only 15 minutes.
Preferred Reagent Compositions
              [0060] The disclosed technique for preparation of nucleic acid from
formaldehyde-containing liquid-based cytology preservatives relies on the combined use of
a protease enzyme and 2-imidazolidone.               The disclosed technique further relies upon use
                                                      -15

of a protease enzyme at a high temperature.                  In a preferred approach, the protease
enzyme begins in a lyophilized form that is reconstituted using a buffered solution that
includes 2-imidazolidone.               Preferably, the reconstitution buffer further includes EDTA.      In
one highly preferred embodiment, the protease enzyme is the proteinase K enzyme, which
is known to retain activity within the broad range of pH 4.0 - pH 12.0.                However, the pH of
the buffer used for reconstituting protease enzyme preferably falls in the range of from
about pH 7.5 to about pH 8.5.                This range permits optimal enzymatic activity while still
protecting RNA from hydrolytic cleavage that occurs under strongly alkaline conditions.
Still more preferably, the buffer used in the reconstitution buffer includes a Tris buffer at
about pH 8.0.
              [00611 The final concentrations of key reagent components, when combined with an
optional diluent and the liquid-based cytology preservative that includes formaldehyde, fall
within preferred ranges.              The optional diluent can be a buffered solution that includes a
detergent that lyses cell membranes.                 Exemplary detergents include anionic detergents
such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and lithium lauryl sulfate (LLS).               Other detergents,
such as the nonionic detergents, may also be useful.                 Advantageously, the strong ionic
detergents can denature proteins, thereby rendering them better targets for proteolysis by
the proteinase K enzyme.                The final concentration (by molarity) of 2-imidazolidine in the
reaction mixture preferably is selected to fall in a range that is 1-fold to 5-fold, or more
preferably 2-fold to 5-fold the final maximum concentration of formaldehyde.                    Final
concentration of 2-imdazolidone is determined the moles added over the volume of the
reaction mixture after all reagents have been added.                  Final concentration of formaldehyde
is the amount of moles present in the preservative used for making the specimen divided by
the volume of the reaction mixture after all reagents have been added.                   In other words, no
subtraction is made for formaldehyde consumed in inducing crosslinks before the heat
incubation.               For example, if a reaction mixture prepared by combining 1 ml of liquid-based
cytology preservative (e.g., including a cellular specimen), 2.9 ml of a diluent, and 0.3 ml of a
reagent including 2-imidazolidone, proteinase K enzyme, EDTA, and buffer had a final
formaldehyde concentration of about 28 mM, then the final concentration of
2-imidazolidone at about 2-fold excess would be about 50 mM to about 60 mM.                       The final
concentration of proteinase K enzyme advantageously can be reduced in the present
                                                         -16

formulation relative to the amount that would otherwise be used in the absence of
2-imidazolidone.                    Although practice of the invention is not dependent on an understanding
of any particular mechanism of action, it is believed that proteinase K may serve to digest
amine bonds connecting proteins to methyl bridges, thereby releasing nucleic acid and
making it accessible for target capture in the hybridization-dependent target capture step of
the APTIMA* assay.                     The final concentration of proteinase K enzyme preferably falls in the
range of from about 43 U/ml to about 4.3 U/ml, with a concentration of about 10-11 U/ml
being highly preferred.                   Thus, a reaction volume of 4.2 ml would preferably include about
40-50U or 43 U of proteinase K enzyme.                      The final concentration of EDTA preferably falls in
the range of from 10 mM to 100 mM, more preferably in the range of from 10 mM to 50
mM, and still more preferably in the range of from 30 mM to 40 mM.                          The final
concentration of buffering agent is variable, based on the structure of the agent, but is
sufficient to provide adequate buffer capacity to ensure RNA contained in the sample is not
substantially degraded by alkaline hydrolysis.                    This requirement can be fulfilled by
employing a final buffer concentration in the range of from at least 10 mM up to about 500
mM, more preferably up to about 250 mM, still more preferably up to about 100 mM, and
yet still more preferably up to about 50 mM.                      A highly preferred final concentration range
for buffer in the reaction mixture prior to incubation at elevated temperature is 10 m M to
50 mM.
              [0062] The specimen can be combined with protease and 2-imidazolidone in any
order.         For example, the protease and 2-imidazolidone can be combined with the
specimen simultaneously.                     Alternatively, the protease can be combined with the specimen
first, followed by 2-imidazolidone, or vice a versa.
              [0063] Both of the reconstitution buffer and lyophilized protease may be
components of a kit, and may be combined shortly before use.                        That is to say, an end-user
of the kit may reconstitute the lyophilized enzyme to prepare the enzyme reagent that
includes, for example, 2-imidazolidone, proteinase K enzyme, EDTA, and pH buffer.
Preferably, a single solution of the reagent kit includes 2-imidazolidone, EDTA, and pH
buffer, but does not include the proteinase K enzyme.                      The proteinase K enzyme
preferably is packaged in a separate vial of the kit, where the enzyme is in the form of a
lyophilisate.

Preferred Target Enrichment Approaches
              [0064] Before initiating the amplification reaction, it may be desirable to first enrich
or isolate target nucleic acids using a target capture technique.                     In a preferred approach,
nucleic acids from the reaction mixture incubated at elevated temperature following
addition of a reagent including 2-imidazolidone and proteinase K enzyme are contacted with
a solid support having disposed thereon an immobilized probe.                         According to one
embodiment, target nucleic acids having been processed by treatment with the
combination of 2-imidazolidone and protease enzyme under elevated temperature
conditions in the presence of EDTA and a pH buffer hybridize directly to the immobilized
capture probe in a sequence-specific fashion.                      In a different embodiment, a "target
capture probe" serves to bridge the solid support-immobilized capture probe and the target
nucleic acid that is to be amplified.                   General features of this approach are disclosed by
Weisburg et al., in U.S. 6,534,273, the disclosure of this document being incorporated by
reference herein.                    Regardless of which approach is chosen, it should be clear that
hybridization involving the target nucleic acid that is to be amplified is an essential feature
of the procedure.
              [0065] A variant target capture approach that may be used in connection with the
techniques disclosed herein, and that relies on nonspecific hybridization to the target that is
to be amplified, is detailed in published U.S. patent application U.S. 2008/0286775 Al, the
disclosure of this document being incorporated by reference herein.                         In accordance with
the nonspecific hybridization approach, the capture probe includes at least one sequence
that exhibits alternative base pairing properties for the target nucleic acid compared to
standard base pairing (i.e., G:C and A:T/U bonding).                      The target nucleic acid purified by this
nonspecific hybridization approach may be RNA or DNA, which is at least partially
single-stranded.                    Again, it should be clear that this sequence-independent target capture
approach still relies on nucleic acid hybridization.
              [0066] The present data show that target capture can occur notwithstanding the
presence of 2-imidazolidone and reports that some imidazolines cause denaturation of
nucleic acids.

Preferred Nucleic Acid Amplification Methods
              [00671 Examples of amplification methods useful in connection with the present
invention include, but are not limited to: transcription mediated amplification (TMA),
single-primer nucleic acid amplification, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA),
the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), strand displacement amplification (SDA),
self-sustained sequence replication (3SR), DNA ligase chain reaction (LCR) and amplification
methods using self-replicating polynucleotide molecules and replication enzymes such as
MDV-1 RNA and Q-beta enzyme.                       Methods for carrying out these various amplification
techniques respectively can be found in U.S. Patent No. 5,399,491, U.S. patent application

how to perform nucleic acid amplification reactions are hereby incorporated by reference.
Reaction Mechanism
              [00681 Although practice of the present methods is not depending on an
understanding of mechanism, Fig. 6 illustrates a possible reaction mechanism underlying
the methods. Under acidic conditions, formaldehyde 2 in a specimen can react with the
nucleophilic functional groups of either nucleotides or polypeptides.                  Elimination of water
then generates a reactive imine 4.                   A second nucleotide can then react with the imine to
form the dimer 5.                   Proteinase K, which is a serine protease, hydrolyzes and cleaves the
nitrogen-methylene linker.                   This cleavage can regenerate the starting nucleotides and
formaldehyde.                   2-imidazolidone, which is a formaldehyde scavenger, can react with two
molecules of formaldehyde to generate an imidazolidone-methanol compound 7.                         This
reaction effectively prevents the formaldehyde from reacting again with either the released
nucleotides or polypeptides.
Sensitivity
              [0069] Treatment of a specimen with a protease and 2-imidazolidone as just
described can result in reversal of more modifications, particularly cross-links, on nucleic
                                                             -19
10072052_1 (GHMatters) P104017.AU.1

acids in the sample, more nucleic acids being freed from cross-linked polypeptides, greater
yield of captured nucleic acid, greater yield of amplified nucleic acids, and improved assay
sensitivity (i.e., lower threshold of a target DNA needed to be presence for a target).         Such
improvements can be measured relative to otherwise comparable controls in which the
protease or the 2-imidazolidone or both is/are omitted.              Preferably improvement is shown
compared both with a control in which the protease is omitted and with a control in which
the 2 imidazolidone is omitted.           Improvement means an improvement of sufficient
magnitude to make it beyond typical experimental variation (p < 0.05). For example, in
some methods, treatment can result in an improvement of at least 5%, 10%, 20%, or 30% of
yield of nucleic acids freed from cross-links or captured nucleic acids or amplified nucleic
acids.         Presence of cross-links can be assessed by assays separating by molecular weight
such as gel electrophoresis or various forms of column chromatography.               In some
methods, treatment results in at least 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90% of nucleic acid molecules being
free of cross-links to polypeptides and thus potentially subject to a hybridization capture
assay or amplification. In some methods, treatment results in a higher assay positivity (or
lower threshold of detection) meaning that some samples yield a positive result (target
nucleic acid present) after treatment in accordance with the present methods than in
control treatments in which either protease or 2-imidazolidone is omitted.
Preferred Embodiments
              [0070] The following Examples disclose experimental procedures carried out to
demonstrate the benefits of treating specimens in a formaldehyde-containing liquid-based
cytology preservative with the combination of 2-imidazolidone and proteinase K enzyme at
an elevated temperature.            In a preferred embodiment, this combination is used in the
presence of Tris buffer and EDTA.            In all instances, the SUREPATH liquid-based cytology
preservative served as the model liquid-based preservative containing formaldehyde.               In
the descriptions that follow, "demodifier solution" refers to a pH-buffered solution (pH 8.0)
that included EDTA (500 mM) and 2-imidazolidone (in the range of from 740 mM to 750
mM).           Preferred buffers for use in the demodifier solution include Tris buffer.   As used
herein, "specimen transport medium" (STM) refers to a phosphate-buffered detergent
solution which, in addition to lysing cells, protects released RNAs by inhibiting the activity of
                                                       -20
10072052_1 (GHMatters) P104017.AU.1

RNases that may be active in the sample undergoing testing.                         Preferred detergents that
may be used in STM include sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and lithium lauryl sulfate (LLS),
with LLS being slightly more preferred.                    When samples of liquid-based cytology
preservative containing formaldehyde are to be combined with the demodifier solution and
proteinase Kenzyme, lyophilized enzyme conveniently can be reconstituted with the
demodifier solution, and an aliquot of the reconstituted enzyme solution can be added to a
reaction vessel containing the liquid-based cytology preservative.
              [00711 Example 1 describes procedures used to assess analytical sensitivity of the
experimental system by testing panels that included in vitro transcripts for each of the 14
high risk HPV genotypes.                    Success of the nucleic acid processing technique involving
treatment with 2-imidazolidone and proteinase Kunder elevated temperature conditions
was measured by detection of HPV RNA using a commercially available assay.                           As indicated
below, results showed that the treatment conditions did not compromise amplification and
detection of HPV RNAs.
                                                           Example 1

                                                    Synthetic Transcripts
              [0072] In vitro synthesized transcripts served as templates for amplification in
conventional TMA reactions performed using the APTIMA® HPV genetic probe assay for
amplification and detection of HPV RNA.                      The transcript copy number used for each
different HPV type corresponded to the limit of detection (LOD) for the APTIMA HPV genetic
probe assay that had been established in preliminary procedures using specimens preserved
in THINPREP liquid-based cytology preservative (i.e., the model preservative that does not
contain formaldehyde).                    The LOD is the copy level that leads to a minimum positivity of at
least 95% for all specimens tested.                   In this instance, in vitro transcripts were all used at 20
to 600 copies/reaction, as appropriate.
              [0073] Three different sample processing conditions were tested.                  First, in vitro
transcripts were added to THINPREP* liquid-based cytology samples in STM (1 ml sample
and 2.9 ml STM), and then processed according to directions from the manufacturer of the
APTIMA* HPV genetic probe assay.                       Second, in vitro transcripts were added to clinical
                                                               -21

HPV-negative residual SUREPATH liquid-based cytology preservative specimens in STM (1 ml
sample and 2.9 ml STM).                 Aliquots (3.9 ml each) of the mixture were combined with 100 Il
of a proteinase K reagent (1.8 U/pl proteinase K in Tris buffer (pH 8.0), sodium azide, and
CaC 2), and then incubated for 2 hours at 65 0 C.                Following the enzyme digestion step, the
mixtures were processed according to directions from the manufacturer of the APTIMA HPV
genetic probe assay.                Finally, as in the second case, in vitro transcripts were added to
clinical HPV-negative residual SUREPATH liquid-based cytology preservative specimens in
STM.          In this instance, 3.9 ml aliquots of each sample STM mix were combined with 0.3 ml
of a proteinase K enzyme reagent that included 2-imidazolidone in Tris-EDTA buffer.                    This
reagent had been prepared by reconstituting lyophilized proteinase K using the demodifier
solution.            The final mixtures included 36 mM EDTA, 36 mM Tris-HCI, about 53 mM
2-imidazolidone, and 43 U of proteinase K enzyme.                    Mixtures were incubated at 90'C for
15 minutes, and then processed according to directions from the manufacturer of the
APTIMA* HPV genetic probe assay.                     Following amplification and detection of HPV RNA, the
frequency of positive HPV detection was compared among replicates.
              [0074] Figure 1 shows the results of the analytical sensitivity evaluation performed
using in vitro transcripts.             Assay positivity for the samples preserved in SUREPATH
liquid-based cytology preservative was at least 95% for 11 of the 14 HPV genotypes; with 3
genotypes, HPV 56, 58 and 59 yielding 93.3, 91.7 and 90% positivity, respectively.                  These
results were similar to those obtained for samples preserved in THINPREP liquid-based
cytology preservative, and similar or better than samples that had been preserved in
SUREPATH liquid-based cytology preservative and then treated with proteinase K enzyme
alone.         This established the utility of the HPV testing system, and showed that use of the
combination of 2-imidazolidone and proteinase K enzyme under elevated temperature
conditions did not substantially inhibit in vitro amplification and detection reactions.
              [00751 Example 2 describes procedures used for assessing analytical sensitivity of
the HPV assay by testing a panel of human cells containing HPV.                    Procedures were
generally as described under Example 1, except that: (1) HPV-expressing cell lines were used
in place of in vitro transcripts; and (2) the samples were incubated in the presence of the
formaldehyde-containing preservative for an extended period.

                                              Human Cell Lines Containing HPV
              [0076] Human cell lines containing HPV were spiked into specimen pools of the
SUREPATH liquid-based cytology preservative, stored for 7 days at 25'C, and then tested at
half-log dilutions (3 to 30 cells/reaction) after treatment with either the combination of the
demodifier solution and proteinase K at 90'C for 15 minutes, or proteinase K alone at 65'C
for 2 hours.               As in Example 1, the combination of demodifier solution and proteinase K was
conveniently delivered as a single aliquot by reconstituting lyophilized proteinase K with the
demodifier solution.                  Of course, there is no requirement for combining the reagents in this
fashion.           Cells used in this procedure were: (1) SiHa cells (expressing HPV16); (2) HeLa cells
(expressing HPV 18); and (3) MS751 cells (expressing HPV 45).                      Again, HPV nucleic acids
were captured, amplified and detected using the APTIMA HPV genetic probe assay in
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.                      The positivity of samples treated under
the two conditions was compared.
              [0077] Figures 2A-2C show the analytical sensitivity results obtained using cell lines
that had been stored for 7 days at 25'C in SUREPATH liquid-based cytology preservative.
Assay positivity for all three HPV-positive cell lines in samples treated with the combination
of the demodifier solution and proteinase K enzyme was at least 95% at concentrations of
30, 10 and 30 cells/reaction for SiHa, HeLa and MS751 cells, respectively.                    These results
were similar or better than results obtained using samples that had been stored 7 days at
25'C in SUREPATH liquid-based cytology preservative and then treated with proteinase K
enzyme alone.                   The most dramatic differences were observed in the trials using HeLa cells
at the lowest input cell count.                 There was a clear statistically significant advantage to the
sample processing treatment using 2-imidazolidone in combination with proteinase K and
high temperature.
              [0078] Example 3 describes procedures that demonstrated how the combined use of
2-imidazolidone and proteinase K under elevated temperature conditions led to improved
recovery of amplifiable nucleic acid from samples stored for extended periods in a
liquid-based cytology preservative containing formaldehyde.                       As discussed below, the
                                                             -23

difference in RNA recovery relative to trials treated with proteinase K alone was most
noticeable at extended time periods.

                           a Liquid-Based Cytology Preservative Containing Formaldehyde
              [00791 To mimic clinical specimens, ten pools of residual specimens in SUREPATH
liquid-based cytology preservative, previously determined to be HPV-negative using the
APTIMA HPV genetic probe assay, were split in half and spiked with either SiHa or HeLa
cells.       All tubes were stored neat at 250 C for up to 42 days.         Aliquots from each pool were
diluted in a 1:2.9 SUREPATH:STM matrix to final cell concentrations of 30 and 100
cells/reaction on each day of testing.             Samples were processed either by treatment with
proteinase K alone for 2 hours at 65 0 C, or with the combination of demodifier solution and
proteinase K (the combination being delivered as a single aliquot of proteinase K
reconstituted with demodifier solution) for 15 minutes at 90'C.                 Again, HPV nucleic acids
were captured, amplified and detected using the APTIMA HPV genetic probe assay in
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
              [00801 Figures 3A-3B present results supporting the advantages of sample
processing that included treatment with the combination of 2-imidazolidone and proteinase
K under elevated temperature conditions, relative to treatment with proteinase K alone.
All results during this study were valid.            At 30 cells per reaction, both SiHa and HeLa cells
treated with the combination of 2-imidazolidone and proteinase K (e.g., proteinase K
reconstituted with demodifier solution) maintained 100% positivity out to Day 14.                  Beyond
this storage period, the combination treatment enhanced recovery of amplifiable RNA to a
greater extent than treatment with proteinase K alone.                 At 100 cells/reaction, HeLa cells
maintained 100% positivity out to Day 28, while SiHa cells remain 100% positive until Day 21
(data not shown).

              [0082] Thirty verified HPV-positive clinical specimens in SUREPATH liquid-based
cytology preservative, obtained from a referral population, were evaluated in this study.
An aliquot (0.5 ml) of each specimen was added to 2.9 ml STM and then diluted 1:10 and
1:100 in a 0.5:2.9 SP:STM matrix.                Dilutions were stored at 4'C and then tested at various
time points for 120 days with the APTIMA HPV genetic probe assay (N=4 for each sample,
120 total replicates per time point).               On each day of testing, 1 ml aliquots of the samples
were mixed with 2.9 ml of STM and 0.3 ml of a reagent that included proteinase K
reconstituted in demodifier solution to a final concentration of 143 U/ml of proteinase K.
Mixtures were incubated at 90'C for 15 minutes, processed to isolate nucleic acids by a
target capture protocol, and tested with the APTIMA HPV genetic probe assay on an
automated testing instrument.
              [0083] Figure 4 presents results showing that clinical specimens preserved in a
liquid-based cytology preservative containing formaldehyde could be treated with the
combination of 2-imidazolidone and proteinase K under elevated temperature conditions
for a short time period to result in substantially constant recovery of RNA.               All specimens
that had been diluted 1:10 maintained at least 97.5% positivity after 120 days of storage at
4'C.         Positivity for all 30 specimens diluted 1:100 ranged from 74.2% to 87.5% over the
course of the study, with no consistent decrease in positivity observed.

specimen.               The tube containing HeLa cells and NCPP was inverted to break up the pellet
and incubated at 25*C (concentration: 1000 cells/mL).                  After 0, 7, and 14 days, an aliquot
from the tube was removed, STM was added, and dilutions were performed to a final
concentration of 10 cells/reaction (final ratio of NCPP:STM 1:2.9). Tubes were treated (see
next section) and tested using an APTIMA* HPV kit according to manufacturer's
instructions.
              [00851 Treatment methods:             After 25*C incubation and STM addition (see previous

preservative containing formaldehyde could be treated with the combination of a
formaldehyde scavenger, proteinase K and an elevated temperature for a short time period
to result in substantially constant recovery of RNA.            These data further show formulations
containing proteinase K that are useful at high temperatures known to denature and
inactivate proteinase K and further known to destroy RNA, and yet provide superior nucleic
acid recovery compared to recovery at lower temperatures.                These data further show that
formulations that allow for recovery of nucleic acids from a formalin containing solution

    Work Flow Incorporating Processing of Specimens Preserved in a Liquid-Based Cytology
                                          Preservative that Includes Formaldehyde
              [0095] Example 8 describes a typical work flow for processing clinical samples. A
clinical sample obtained using a swab device is introduced into a vial containing a
liquid-based cytology preservative that includes formaldehyde, and the vial is capped
securely.            SUREPATH liquid-based cytology preservative can be used as the liquid-based
cytology preservative.                   Cellular material dispersed in the liquid contents of the vial is
transported to a clinical laboratory for testing, including molecular analysis of nucleic acid.
At the clinical laboratory an aliquot of the vial is mixed with an aliquot of a diluent, such as a
buffered detergent solution.                    A phosphate-buffered detergent solution is one example of a
preferred diluent.                   The detergent used in this application preferably is an anionic
detergent, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or lithium lauryl sulfate (LLS).                     The mixture
is further combined with 2-imidazolidone and a protease.                        The protease used for this
purpose may be the proteinase K enzyme.                        In a simplified approach, lyophilized proteinase
K is reconstituted in a solution that includes a pH buffer, EDTA, and 2-imidazolidone.                      The
pH buffer may be a Tris buffer, and the reconstituted enzyme solution may have a pH of
about 8.0.              The final mixture that includes the diluted clinical sample, the 2-imidazolidone
and the protease enzyme is then heated to an elevated temperature for between 5 minutes
and 30 minutes.                     The mixture is preferably heated to about 900 Cfor about 15 minutes.
Nucleic acid in the sample is rendered suitable for purification and use as a template in an in
vitro amplification reaction.                  For example, RNA is purified by capture onto a solid support,
for example using sequence-specific hybridization to an immobilized nucleic acid strand, and
then amplified in a nucleic acid amplification reaction.                     The nucleic acid amplification
reaction may be a Transcription Mediated Amplification (TMA) reaction.                         Amplification
products are contacted with a sequence-specific hybridization probe to determine the
presence or absence of a particular target sequence.                       The particular target sequence may
be an HPV target sequence.                     The workflow is depicted in Figure 5.
              [0096] This invention has been described with reference to a number of specific
examples and embodiments thereof.                        Of course, a number of different embodiments of
