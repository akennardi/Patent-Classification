                                            ABSTRACT
          Antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof are engineered to bind Transforming
  Growth Factor-3 (TGF3). TGF-isoform selective antibodies or antigen-binding fragments
  thereof may selectively bind human TGFP 1, compared to human TGF32 and human TGF33,
5 or may selectively bind human TGFP3, compared to human TGFP1 and human TGF32. The
  design of the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof is facilitated by a co-crystal
  structure of a recombinant Fab fragment of GC1008 bound to TGF32 and by another co
  crystal structure of the scFv version of GC 1008 bound to TGFP 1.

   TECHNICAL FIELD
10          Antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof are engineered to bind Transforming
   Growth Factor-3 (TGFP). Compositions comprising the antibodies or fragments thereof and
   methods of using the same for treatment of diseases involving TGFP activity are provided.
   BACKGROUND
            Many severe diseases are linked to malfunctions of the TGFP-induced signaling
15 pathway. An increased tissue level of TGFP is believed to be a factor in the development of
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and myocardial fibrosis, for example. Furthermore, high local
   tissue levels of TGFP can allow the maintenance and progression of some types of cancer
   cells. The down-regulation of TGFP signaling therefore can reduce the viability of such
   tumor cells.
20          TGFP isoforms are -25 kDa homodimeric molecules with a similar structural
   framework in which two monomers are covalently linked via a disulfide bridge. The
   mammalian isoforms share a sequence identity of 70-82%, but have non-overlapping
   activities in vascular development and the regulation of immune cell function. Three TGFP
   isoforms are present in humans: TGF1 I, TGFP2, and TGFP3 (Swiss Prot accession numbers
25 P01137, P08112, and P10600, respectively). TGF1 I and TGFP3 trigger a cellular signaling
   cascade upon binding to the extracellular domains of two transmembrane receptors, known as
   TGFP receptor types I and II. TGFP2 binding is also thought to involve TGFP receptor types
   I and II, as well as TGFP receptor type III.
                                                   1

            Antibody molecules the can bind human TGF 1, TGF 2, and TGFP3 have been
   generated (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,723,486 to Genzyme). Griitter et al. (2008) Proc.Nat'l
   Acad. Sci. USA 105(51): 20251-56, for example, disclose GC1008, a human IgG4
   monoclonal antibody (MAb) in clinical development for treating malignancy and fibrotic
 5 diseases. GC1008 is a "pan-specific" TGFP neutralizing antibody, because it can neutralize
   all three human TGFP isoforms. GC1008 binds to human TGF 1, TGFP2, and TGFP3 with
   similar affinities. The TGFP epitope recognized by GC1008 overlaps the TGFP binding site
   for TGFP receptor types I and II, which is believed to underlie the neutralizing ability of
   GC1008. Griitter et al. disclose the three dimensional structure of a GC1008 Fab fragment in
10 complex with TGFP3 at a resolution of 3.1    A.  The complex consists of a TGFP3 homodimer
   flanked by two GC1008 Fab fragments. See also Proteopedia entry 3eo0, "Structure of the
   Transforming Growth Factor-Beta Neutralizing Antibody GC-1008," on the Internet at
   proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/3eo0 (last modified Oct. 20, 2012); and Proteopedia entry
   3 eo 1, "Structure of the Fab Fragment of GC- 1008 in Complex with Transforming Growth
15 Factor-Beta 3," on the Internet at proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/3eol (last modified Oct. 20,

   SUMMARY
            TGF1-binding antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof are disclosed. The
   TGFP-binding antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof may be pan-specific for all
20 TGFP isoforms (TGFP1, TGFP2 and TGFP3). Such antibodies or antigen-binding fragments
   thereof may neutralize all TGFP isoforms. Alternatively or in addition, the TGFP-binding
   antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof may selectively bind human TGFP 1,
   compared to human TGFP2 and human TGFP3, or which selectively bind human TGFP3,
   compared to human TGFP1 and human TGFP2. TGFP isoform-specific antagonists may
25 exhibit fewer potential side effects. The design of the antibodies or antigen-binding
   fragments thereof is facilitated by a co-crystal structure of a recombinant Fab fragment of the
   GC 1008 monoclonal antibody, GC 1008(Fab) herein, bound to TGFP2 and by another co
   crystal structure of the scFv version of GC 1008, known as GC 1009 or GC 1009(scFv) herein,
   bound to TGF1 I.

                                                    3

           Alternatively, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof may be capable of
   selectively binding human TGFP1, compared to human TGF32 and human TGFP3. The
   antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof may selectively bind TGF3 1 with an affinity
   two-fold, 2.4-fold, three-fold, five-fold, ten-fold, or higher than GC1008(Fab) or

   selectively binding human TGF33, compared to human TGFP1 and human TGF32. The
   antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof may selectively bind TGF33 with an affinity

20 residues, and more preferably up to 12 substitutions of non-paratope residues.
           In any case above, the antibody may be an IgGI, IgG2, or IgG4 antibody, e.g., a
   variant of the GC1008 monoclonal antibody. The antigen-binding fragment thereof may be
   an scFv, e.g., a variant of GC1009(scFv), or a di-scFv, for example. Alternatively, the VH
   domain may further comprise a human heavy chain constant domain, e.g., an IgGI, IgG2, or
25 IgG4 constant domain, and the VL domain may further comprise a human light chain
   constant domain, e.g., a  K light chain constant domain. The heavy chain constant domain

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
10         The present TGFj-binding antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof are
   variants that comprise a modified VH domain of the GC 1008 antibody, where the variants
   comprise an amino acid substitution of the VH and/or VL domain (SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ
   ID NO: 2, respectively). For example, TGF antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof
   may comprise a VH domain with an amino acid substitution that confers comparable or
15 improved binding to human TGF (TGF 1, TGF2 and TGF3) that that observed with the
   GC1008 antibody. TGFj-isoform selective antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof
   can bind human TGF 1 selectively, compared to human TGF2 and human TGF3, or they
   can bind human TGF3 selectively, compared to human TGF1 and human TGF2.
   Selective binding can be achieved by substituting one or more amino acids of the antibodies
20 or antigen-binding fragments thereof comprising a VH domain (SEQ ID NO: 1).
           "Selective binding" means that the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof (i)
   can bind a specific isoform of human TGF with a higher affinity than an antibody or
   antigen-binding fragment thereof that comprises an unmodified VH domain of the GC 1008
   antibody, and/or (ii) can bind the other TGF isoforms with a lower affinity than an antibody
25 or antigen-binding fragment thereof that comprises an unmodified VH domain of the GC 1008
   antibody. For example, an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that selectively
   binds the TGF1 isoform can bind TGF1 with a higher affinity than GC1008(Fab) or
   GC1009(scFv), e.g., two-fold, three-fold, five-fold, ten-fold higher, or more. The antibody or
   antigen-binding fragment thereof alternatively or in addition can bind TGF2 and TGF3
                                                   6

   with a lower affinity than GC1008(Fab) or GC1009(scFv), e.g., two-fold, three-fold, five
   fold, ten-fold lower, or more.
           As used herein, a first element "and/or" a second element means a specific disclosure
   of the first or second element separately, or the first and second elements in combination.
 5 The singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly
   dictates otherwise.
   Antibodies or Antigen-Binding Fragments Thereof
           Antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof comprising a modified VH domain
   of the GC 1008 antibody include, but are not limited to, whole antibodies, e.g., IgG, such as
10 IgG1, IgG2, or IgG4, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, e.g., F(ab')2, scFv, Fab, or dAb
   polypeptides. Monovalent antigen-binding fragments may include Fab, Fv, scFv, and di
   scFv, which are two scFv molecules joined by a peptide linker. Antigen-binding fragments
   may be multivalent, e.g., directed to TGFP and another antigen. Multivalent fragments
   include F(ab') 2 and di-scFv, where the two scFv components are composed of different
15 variable domains directed to separate antigens. The present antibody or antigen-binding
   fragment thereof, for example, may be a modified GC1008 (a whole human IgG4 antibody),
   GC1008(Fab) (a Fab fragment of GC1008), or GC1009(scFv) (an scFv version of GC1008).
   GC1009(scFv) is a recombinantly produced antigen-binding fragment comprising a human
   heavy chain PET1073G12 VH domain (SEQ ID NO: 1) and a human light chain
20 PET1073G12 VL domain (SEQ ID NO: 2) linked by a peptide linker, which allows the two
   domains to associate into an antigen binding site. GC1008 and GC1009 are disclosed in
   further detail in U.S. Patent No. 7,723,486 and Gritter (2008). The amino acid sequence of
   GC1009(scFv) is set forth below, where the peptide linker of the (Gly4/Ser)n motif (SEQ ID
   NO: 10) is bolded and italicized and the signal peptide is highlighted in gray:

           A "modified" or "variant" variable domain comprises amino acid substitutions,
   compared to the reference sequence. A "variant VH domain of the GC1008 antibody," for
   example, may comprise amino acid substitutions compared to the PET 1073 G 12 VH domain
   with the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1.
 5         The VH domain and/or VL domain may comprise up to 20 substitutions of paratope
   residues, preferably up to 19 substitutions of paratope residues, and more preferably up to 12
   substitutions of paratope residues. . For example, one of the two domains may comprise a
   substitution of a paratope residue, while the other domain is unmodified, or both of the
   domains may comprise paratope residue substitutions. A paratope substitution may be
10 selected from the substitutions set forth in TABLE 5. Paratope substitutions may cause the
   modified antibody or antigen-binding fragment to bind a TGF3 isoform selectively, or the
   substitutions may preserve the pan-specific binding of the antibody or antigen-binding
   fragment to TGF3 isoforms. Both types of paratope substitutions also may be made. For
   example, a paratope substitution may cause the antibody or antigen-binding fragment to bind
15 a TGF3 isoform selectively, while another paratope substitution that preserves pan-specific
   binding is made to de-immunize the antibody or antigen-binding fragment. De-immunization
   can be performed according to the method of Harding et al. (2010) mAbs 2: 256-265, for
   example.
           The VH domain and/or VL domain alternatively or in addition may comprise up to 20
20 substitutions of non-paratope residues, preferably up to 18 substitutions of non-paratope
   residues, and more preferably up to 12 substitutions of non-paratope residues.. Non-paratope
   residues may be substituted for various reasons, for example, to increase the thermostability
   of an antigen-binding fragment, to remove an amino acid residue that is susceptible to
   oxidation or deamidation, to add an amino acid that can be easily conjugated to a drug or
25 PEG molecules, for example, or to remove a potential carboxylation site.
           Modifications can also include amino acid deletions. For example, one or two non
   paratope amino acids may be deleted from a variant VH and/or VL domain. The deleted
   amino acids may be from the carboxyl or amino terminal ends of the VH and/or VL domains.
           A variable domain of the present antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof
30 comprises three complementarity determining regions (CDRs), each of which is flanked by a
                                                   8

   framework region (FW). For example, a VH domain may comprise a set of three heavy chain
   CDRs, HCDR1, HCDR2, and HCDR3. A VL domain may comprise a set of three light chain
   CDRs, LCDR1, LCDR2, and LCDR3. A set of HCDRs disclosed herein can be provided in a
   VH domain that is used in combination with a VL domain. A VH domain may be provided
 5 with a set of HCDRs as disclosed herein, and if such a VH domain is paired with a VL
   domain, then the VL domain may be provided with a set of LCDRs disclosed herein. The
   structures and locations of immunoglobulin variable domain CDR and FW regions are
   determined herein by reference to Kabat et al. (1987) Sequences ofProteins of
   ImmunologicalInterest, 4 th ed., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
10         The present antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof contain "paratope" and
   "non-paratope" amino acid residues. A "paratope" amino acid of a present antibody or
   antigen-binding fragment thereof has an atomic nucleus within 4 A of an atomic nucleus of
   human TGFP isoform. Because each human TGFP isoform forms a structurally different
   complex with the present antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof, the paratope
15 residues may be different for each isoform. A "TGF 11 paratope residue," for example, has
   an atomic nucleus within 4 A of an atomic nucleus of human TGFP 1. TABLE 3 shows
   paratope residues of the present antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof for each of
   the human TGF 1, TGFP2, and TGFP3 isoforms. A "TGFP paratope" residue has an atomic
   nucleus within 4 A of an atomic nucleus of all three human TGFP isoforms.
20         A residue is designated a paratope residue irrespective of location within a CDR or
   FW region, as defined by the Kabat nomenclature. Many paratope residues are located
   within CDR regions, as shown in TABLE 4, for example. However, some paratope residues
   are located within the FW regions. A "non-paratope" amino acid is any amino acid of the
   antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that is not a "paratope" amino acid, irrespective
25 of whether the residue is located in a CDR or FW region.
           Antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof may comprise heavy chain and light
   chain amino acid substitutions selected from different human germlines. For example, a set
   of HCDRs may be introduced into a repertoire of variable domains lacking CDRs using
   recombinant DNA technology. Germline frameworks include heavy chain sequences from
30 the human DP-10 (VH 1-69) germline or human DP-88 (VH 1-e) from the VH-I family. Light
                                                  9

   chain sequences may be from the human VK3 family, e.g., human DPK-22 (A27). Human
   germline variable domain amino acid sequences are disclosed by VBASE2 on the Internet at
   vbase2.org/vbstat.php, for example. For example, a set of HCDRs and a set of LCDRs can
   be paired together for the PET1073G12, PET1074B9, or PET1287A10 antibodies. The
 5 antibody thus can be an IgG4 antibody molecule comprising a modified PET1073G12 VH
   domain and/or PET1073G12 VL domain, for example. The amino acid sequences of the
   PET1073G12, PET1074B9, or PET1287A10 domains, including the HCDR and LCDR sets,
   are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 7,723,486.
           Antigen-binding fragments may further comprise antibody constant regions or parts
10 thereof. For example, a VL domain may be attached at its C-terminal end to antibody light
   chain constant domains including human C or Cx chains. Similarly, an antibody or antigen
   binding fragment thereof comprising a VH domain may further comprise attached at its C
   terminal end all or part of an immunoglobulin heavy chain (e.g., a CHJ domain) derived from
   any antibody isotype, e.g., IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgM, or any of the isotype sub-classes,
15 particularly IgGI, IgG2, or IgG4. IgG4 is preferred for some applications because it does not
   bind complement and does not create effector functions. Where an effector function is
   desired, IgGI is preferred. In all cases, the antibody constant regions or parts thereof may be
   human sequences.
           Modifications can be made to the antibody constant regions to improve various
20 properties of the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof. For example, recombinant
   amino acid modifications can be used to decrease structural homogeneity of the expressed
   polypeptides. A representative example is Peters et al. (2012) J. Biol. Chem. 287(29): 24525
   33, which discloses Cys to Ser substitutions in the IgG4 hinge region that reduce the disulfide
   bond heterogeneity and increase Fab domain thermal stability. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2010)
25 Anal. Chem. 82: 1090-99 disclose engineering the IgG2 hinge region to limit disulfide bond
   scrambling and the formation of structural isomers in therapeutic applications. Amino acid
   modifications to a CH3 domain also can be used to delete carboxy-terminal Lys residues to
   decrease the number of charge variants. Amino acid modifications also can be used to
   improve the pharmacological function of recombinant antibodies or antigen-binding
30 fragments thereof. Where antibodies or antigen-binding fragments comprise an Fc region, for
   example, amino acid modifications can be used to increase complement activation, enhance
                                                   10

  antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by increasing FcyRIIIA binding or
  decreasing FcyRIIIB binding, and/or increase serum half-life by increasing FcRn binding.
  Such amino acid modifications are reviewed in Beck et al. (2010) Nature 10: 345-52, for
  example.

           Antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof may be mono-specific for human
   TGFp, or they may be bi-specific. Bi-specific antibodies or antigen-binding fragments
   thereof can be manufactured in a variety of ways, as disclosed, for example, in Holliger et al.
 5 (1993) Current Opinion Biotechnol. 4, 446-449. Examples of bi-specific antibodies include
   those of dual variable domain IgG (DvD-IgG) technology or the BiTETM technology, where
   the binding domains of two antibodies with different specificity can be used and directly
   linked via short flexible peptides.
   Recombinantly modified VH and/or VL domains
10         The heavy chain and/or light chain variable domain of the present antibodies or
   antigen-binding fragments thereof may be modified recombinantly to alter the amino acid
   sequence from a germline sequence. For example, one or more of the CDRs in the heavy
   chain CDR set may be modified, one or more CDRs of the light chain CDR set may be
   modified, and/or one of the framework regions in the VH and/or VL domains may be
15 modified. Substitutions can be made to paratope amino acids, for example, that strengthen or
   weaken the binding affinity to a TGFP isoform, or they can leave the binding affinity
   relatively unchanged. Other substitutions can be made to non-paratope amino acid residues
   to confer various characteristics on the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof, e.g.,
   improving stability or introducing a reactive group of the domain surface that can be
20 covalently modified. Accordingly, the following four categories of amino acid substitutions
   to the VH and/or VL domain of the present antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof
   are among those contemplated herein: (1) substitutions that confer selective binding to a
   human TGFp isoform; (2) substitutions that maintain the pan-specific binding to all three
   human TGFp isoforms; (3) substitutions to non-paratope amino acids ; and (4) multiple
                                                   12

   amino acid substitutions. These categories of amino acid substitutions are not mutually
   exclusive.
           1.      Substitutions conferring selective binding.
           TGFP-isoform selective antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof may
 5 comprise an amino acid substitution within the VH domain (SEQ ID NO: 1). For example,
   the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof can bind human TGFp 1 selectively,
   compared to human TGF32 and human TGFp3, or can selectively bind human TGFP3,
   compared to human TGFpl and human TGFP2. Selective binding can be achieved
   substituting one or more paratope amino acids.
10         Predicting how an amino acid substitution will affect the ability of an antibody or
   antigen-binding fragment thereof to interact with a TGFp isoform is facilitated by a co-crystal
   structure with each of the TGFP isoforms. The co-crystal structure of GC1008(Fab) and
   TGFp3 is disclosed in Gritter (2008). The co-crystal structure of GC1008(Fab) and TGFP2
   is depicted in FIG. 1. The co-crystal structure of GC1009(scFv) and TGFP 1 is depicted in
15 FIG. 2.
           TABLE 2 depicts the amino acid sequence of the human TGFP1, TGFp2, and TGFp3
   isoforms. Comparison of co-crystal structures reveals differences in the paratopes between
   the three isoforms. TGFp residues in each isoform that interact with GC1008 are bolded in

   TGFp isoform. The GC1008 paratope residues in bold are shared between all three TGFP
   isoforms. Three regions of the TGFp epitope are designated as the "tip," "hydrophobic
   patch," and "helix three." The VH and VL domain residues having atomic nuclei within 4      A
   of an atomic nucleus within the "hydrophobic patch" of TGFp, which has the sequence
 5 L28GWKW 32 (SEQ ID NO: 8), are conserved for all three isoforms. GC1008 residues
   interacting with the "tip" and the "helix three" regions, however, show more variability. By
   comparing all three co-crystal structures, it is evident that GC1008 shifts orientation and
   adjusts the CDR loop positions and side chain conformations to accommodate all three TGFP
   isoforms with similar affinity. See FIG. 1 and FIG. 2. For example, Gritter (2008) disclosed
10 that GC1008 displayed similar affinities for the three isoforms: IC 50 values of 1 ± 2 nM,
   14 ±5 nM, and 7      2 nM against TGF 1, TGFp2, and TGFp3, respectively in a mink lung
   epithelial cell (MLEC) proliferation assay. Yet residues 67 and 68 of the three TGFP
   isoforms differ in their interactions with the VH paratope residue Y27. The VH residue Y27
   makes hydrogen-bonding interactions with TGFP1 residues Q67 and H68. By contrast, VH
15 residue Y27 forms hydrophobic interactions with T67 and Y50 of TGFp2 and TGFp3. This
   causes a rearrangement of the HCDR1 loop in the TGFP1 complex, compared to the TGFP2
   and TGFP3 complexes.

           A comparison of co-crystal structures can guide the substitutions to VH and/or VL
 5 domain residues to alter the affinity of GC1008 for TGFp isoforms. In particular, amino acid
   substitutions can be based on the location of each VH and/or VL residue in the three crystal
   structures, taking into consideration whether the residue interacts with the antigen or is
   involved in interactions with other CDRs or structural elements that stabilize the CDR loops.
   For example, 197 on LCDR3 does not directly interact with TGFP in any of the three
10 structures; however, 197 faces the interior of the antibody and in a hydrophobic pocket that is
   also composed of V103 and L104 of the HCDR3. Since V103 and L104 are paratopes
   important for TGFp binding, substitution of 197 with medium or small hydrophobic or
   weakly polar residues could be tolerated without significantly changing the affinity toward
   TGFp, e.g., more than ten-fold.
                                                   15

            The helix3 region shows the most variability in epitope sequence. Lysine and
   arginine at position 60 of TGF 11 and TGF32 cause a rotation of GC1008 bound to TGF 11
   and TGF32 as compared to TGF33. At residues 67 and 68, TGF 11 has glutamine and
   histidine, respectively, instead of threonine and isoleucine/leucine as in TGF32 and TGFP3
 5 (Figure 3). When S30 is mutated to hydrophobic residues such as A, W, additional
   hydrophobic interactions with conserved TGF3 L64 is favored, and therefore increases the
   affinity for all three TGF s. This affinity increase is more pronounced for TGF3 2and 3, due
   to the aforementioned threonine and isoleucine/leucine as in TGF32 and TGF33 at residues
   67 and 68, which favor hydrophobic residues over the     Q and H   of TGF3 1. In TGF 1 and
10 TGF 2, the positively charged side chains at position 60 make ionic interactions with E74 in
   the heavy chain. Replacement of E74 with positively charged residues is less favored for
   GC1008 binding to TGFP 1, but more favored to TGF33, which has a threonine at position 60
   (Figure 4). Due to the small size of the T60 sidechain of TGF 3, most mutations can be
   tolerated at E74 on the heavy chain. Because of the partial hydrophobic nature of T60,
15 hydrophobic substitutions at E74 can also dramatically increase the binding affinity to
   TGF33, often leading to more than two fold of improvement in       kdvr:kdwt ratios.
            To rapidly select for TGF3 antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof with
   greater affinities to a particular TGFP isoform or selectivity for one isoform over the other
   ones, positions listed in Table 3 can be randomized to the other 19 amino acids. This can be
20 achieved by in vitro display of GC1009(scFv), GC1008 Fab fragment, or GC1008 libraries
   using techniques well known in the art (Bradbury et al. (2011) Nature Biotechnol. 29(3):
   245-254). Without the crystal structures of TGF3 1 and TGF32 complexed to GC 1009 and
   GC 1008 Fab, respectively, antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof with higher
   affinities for only TGF33 can be identified using this in vitro display technology based on the
25 TGF 3-contacting amino acids derived from the TGFP3 complex structure disclosed in
   Gritter (2008). With the new TGF1 I and TGF2 complexed to GC1009 and GC1008 Fab
   structures we have determined, antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof with higher
   affinities for TGF1 I and TGF2 can also be rapidly identified by the display technology.
   Moreover, having information on all three structures allows one to make more focused
30 libraries to identify isoform selective variants. Focused libraries for TGFP 1 for example
   would only require randomization of positions 27 and 30 of the VH domain (SEQ ID NO: 1).
                                                    16

   The 322 (1024) possible mutants would be covered by phage libraries with a library size of
   only -10' species. (The 20 amino acids can be represented by 32 codons with a sequence of
   NNG/C, with any of the four nucleic acids at the first two positions and G or C at the third
   position.) Without the crystal structures of TGFP 1 and TGFP2 complexed to
 5 GC1009/GC1008, one would have to randomize all 14 TGF 3-contacting amino acids
   derived from the TGFP3 complex structure disclosed in Griitter (2008). A phage library with
   a diversity of 32" (1021) would not be fully represented in even the best of any known
   libraries, which present no more than about ~1011 species. Thus, the structure data provided
   herein would allow the rapid screening and identification of TGFP selective antagonists.
10          2.       Substitutions maintaining pan-specific binding.
            Substitutions can be made that do not significantly alter the binding affinity toward a
   TGFP isoform. A substitution that does not "significantly alter" the binding affinity toward a
   TGFP isoform does not increase the ratio of the off-rate of the variant (kdvar) compared to the
   off-rate of the wild-type (kdwt) by more than 2.4 (i.e., kdvar/kdwt is less than or equal to 2.4).
15 Antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof that display "pan-specific binding" for this
   purpose can have an apparent binding constant for TGFP (TGF1 I, TGFP2 and TGFP3) of at
   least 10 nM, 30 nM, or 100 nM. Affinity for TGFP isoforms can be measured using any
   appropriate technique in the art, for example, the MLEC proliferation assay disclosed in
   Griitter (2008) or a Biacore@ 3000 (GE Healthcare) binding assay. Antibodies or antigen
20 binding fragments thereof that display "pan-specific binding" for this purpose can have an
   apparent binding affinity (kdvar:kdw t ) for TGFP (TGFP 1, TGFP2 and TGFP3) of less than or
   equal to 2.4-fold, less than or equal to 3-fold, less than or equal to 5-fold, or less than or equal
   to 10-fold compared to wild type, preferably less than or equal to 2.4-fold compared to wild
   type (kdvar:kdwt). These substitutions may be guided by the three co-crystal structures between
25 GCI008/GC1009 and the three TGFP isoforms. See Oberlin et al. (2012) J. Chem. Inf
   Model. 52: 2204-2214.
            Substitutions that maintain pan-specific binding to TGFP are expected to create no
   steric hindrance with TGFP amino acid residues or to have a significant detrimental effect on
   the stability of the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof. Substitutions having a
30 significant detrimental effect on stability can promote aggregation and inactivation of the
                                                    17

   antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof by causing local unfolding or misfolding.
   The destabilized, aggregated antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof can induce
   immunogenicity, because the patient's immune system can recognize such aggregates as
   foreign molecules.
 5         An example of a substitution maintaining pan-specific binding is R24 on LCDR1.
   R24 is oriented away from the TGFP binding site and is exposed on the VL domain surface.
   This position can accommodate a substitution with most polar residues except Pro and Cys,
   which are generally avoided. On the other hand, 152 on HCDR2 makes a close hydrophobic
   interaction with the "hydrophobic patch" on TGFp (L 28GWKW 32 (SEQ ID NO: 8)), so 152
10 substitutions are restricted to medium size hydrophobic residues, with the possibility of a Val
   substitution, whereas a substitution with a larger hydrophobic residues could create steric
   hindrance in the bound complex.
           TABLE 5 provides non-limiting examples of amino acid substitutions of the VL
   domain of SEQ ID NO: 2 (TABLE 5A)and the VH domain of SEQ ID NO: 1 (TABLE 5B).
15 In some cases amino acid substitutions may be made to framework residues within the
   paratope, e.g., VL residue Y50 in the FW2 region. Antibodies or antigen-binding fragments
   with one or more of the substitutions below are expected to have a similar pan-specificity and
   improved affinity toward TGFp as GC1008/GC 1009, i.e., to bind all TGFp isoforms with
   isoforms with a binding affinity (kar:k")of less than or equal to 2.4-fold, less than or equal
20 to 3-fold, less than or equal to 5-fold, or less than or equal to 10-fold compared to wild type .

            3.      Substitutions of non-paratope amino acid residues.
            Non-paratope amino acids can be substituted recombinantly to make a variable light
   or heavy domain with similar or altered properties compared to the germline variable domain.
 5 "Modified" variable domains also include amino acid deletions, as well as substitutions. For
   example, the N-terminal or C-terminal amino acid residue may be deleted in a modified
   variable domain.
            Non-paratope amino acid substitutions can be made, for example, to increase the
   stability and/or decrease the tendency to aggregate. Poor stability can affect the ability of an
10 antigen-binding fragment, for example, to fold properly when recombinantly expressed,
   resulting in a fraction of the expressed fragments being non-functional. Low stability
   antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof also may be prone to forming potentially
   immunogenic aggregates or may have impaired avidity or shelf-life. scFv polypeptides in
   particular may demonstrate problems with stability, solubility, expression, aggregation,
15 breakdown products, and overall manufacturability in both bacterial and mammalian
   expression systems. Framework amino acid substitutions that are expected to increase the
   stability and/or decrease the tendency to aggregate of a VH and/or VL domain, e.g., in an
   scFv polypeptide, are disclosed in WO 2007/109254, for example. Substitutions in
   corresponding residues in the present VH and VL domains are expected similarly to increase
20 stability and/or decrease the tendency to aggregate.
            Substitutions that can be tolerated are expected to include those that would replace a
   non-paratope amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2 with a corresponding amino acid that occurs
   in another human VH or VL domain germline sequence. At present, about 40 variable heavy
   germline sequences are known in the art, as are about 40 variable kappa germline sequences
                                                     21

   and about 30 variable lambda germline sequences. A substitution of a non-paratope amino
   acid with an amino acid occurring in any of these germline sequences is expected to be
   tolerated. For example, a residue of a VH domain of SEQ ID NO: 1 could be substituted with
   an amino acid appearing in a corresponding position in any VH germline sequence, e.g., the
 5 germline sequence from DP-10 (VH 1-69) or DP-88 (VH 1-e). Corresponding positions in this
   case are determined by a sequence alignment between the various germline sequences, using
   alignment techniques well known in the art, e.g., ClustalW.
           Additional substitutions that are expected to be tolerated are those made to an amino
   acid with most of its side chain exposed to the solvent, as determined by analysis of the three
10 co-crystal structures. The solvent-accessible surface area of a residue may be estimated using
   techniques well known in the art. Further, it is expected that substitutions to amino acids
   buried within the variable domains will be better tolerated if the side chain of the amino acid
   does not create steric hindrance with adjoining residues. For this reason, buried amino acids
   generally are substituted with amino acids with side chains of similar or smaller size. For
15 example, a substitution of a buried Ile residue with a Leu, Val, Ala, or Gly is expected to be
   tolerated. Possible steric hindrance created by a substitution can be predicted by analysis of
   the three co-crystal structures. Further substitutions that are expected to be tolerated are those
   maintaining existing electrostatic interactions within the variable domains, e.g., dipole-dipole
   interactions, induced dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds, or ionic bonds.
20         Additional amino acid substitutions of variable domains include those expected to
   confer new useful properties to the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof. For
   example, putative N-glycosylation sites in the VH and/or VL domains can be removed to
   prevent or reduce the formation of N-glycoforms. The amino-terminal residue can be
   substituted with a Gln residue to cause pyroglutamylation, which can decrease the number of
25 charge variants. Amino acid substitutions can be used to lower the isoelectric point, which
   can decrease the rate of elimination of IgG polypeptide antibodies, for example.
            Surface residues of variable domains can be substituted with Cys or Lys residues, for
   example, which then can be covalently modified and coupled to molecules conferring useful
   characteristics to the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof, e.g., a detectable label,
30 toxin, targeting moiety, or protein. For example, Cys residue can be coupled to a cytotoxic
                                                   22

   drug to form a drug conjugate. Cys residues also can be coupled to molecules that increase
   the serum half-life, e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG) or serum albumin. Such amino acid
   modifications are reviewed in Beck et al. (2010) Nature 10: 345-52, for example.
            Detectable labels include radiolabels such as 1311 or 99Tc, which may be attached to
 5 antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof using methods known in the art. Labels also
   include enzyme labels such as horseradish peroxidase. Labels further include chemical
   moieties such as biotin which may be detected via binding to a specific cognate detectable
   moiety, e.g., labeled avidin. Other moieties can be attached that facilitate purification. For
   example, antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof can be His-tagged using well
10 known methods of recombinant modification and expression.
            4.      Multiple amino acid substitutions to variable domains
            Multiple amino acid substitutions can be made to the antibodies or antigen-binding
   fragments thereof. As a general rule, the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof are
   expected to maintain stability and functionality after at least several randomly selected amino
15 acid substitutions. See, e.g., Wells, Biochemistry 29: 8509-17 (1990). However, as more
   substitutions are randomly introduced into a variable domain, for example, the overall
   stability of the domain may decrease, its tendency to aggregate may increase, its affinity for
   TGF3 may decrease, and its possible immunogenicity may increase. Thus, when multiple
   amino acid substitutions are made, preferred substitutions are selected from those described
20 above, which are expected to maintain stability and functionality. The functionality of the
   modified variable domains can be tested using routine methods known in the art, including
   but not limited to the MLEC proliferation assay disclosed in Griitter (2008).
   Nucleic Acids and Methods of Making Antibodies and Antigen-Binding Fragments
            A further aspect of the present invention provides nucleic acids encoding antibodies
25 or antigen-binding fragments thereof disclosed herein. The isolated nucleic acid may be a
   synthetic DNA, a non-naturally occurring mRNA, or a cDNA, for example. The nucleic acid
   may be inserted within a plasmid, vector, or transcription or expression cassette. A
   recombinant host cell may comprise one or more constructs above. An "isolated" nucleic
   acid (or antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof) is removed from its natural
                                                   23

   environment, and may additionally be in substantially pure, e.g., at least 90% pure, or in
   homogeneous form.
           Methods of preparing antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof comprise
   expressing the encoding nucleic acid in a host cell under conditions to produce the antibodies
 5 or antigen-binding fragments thereof, and recovering the antibodies or antigen-binding
   fragments thereof. The process of recovering the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments
   thereof may comprise isolation and/or purification of the antibodies or antigen-binding
   fragments thereof. The method of production may comprise formulating the antibodies or
   antigen-binding fragments thereof into a composition including at least one additional
10 component, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.
           Suitable vectors comprising a nucleic acid encoding antibodies or antigen-binding
   fragments thereof can be chosen or constructed, containing appropriate regulatory sequences,
   including promoter sequences, terminator sequences, polyadenylation sequences, enhancer
   sequences, marker genes and other sequences as appropriate. Vectors may be plasmids,
15 phage, phagemids, adenoviral, AAV, lentiviral, for example. Techniques and protocols for
   manipulation of nucleic acid, for example in preparation of nucleic acid constructs,
   mutagenesis, sequencing, introduction of DNA into cells, and gene expression, are well
   known in the art.
           Introducing such nucleic acids into a host cell can be accomplished using techniques
20 well known in the art. For eukaryotic cells, suitable techniques may include calcium
   phosphate transfection, DEAE-Dextran, electroporation, liposome-mediated transfection, and
   transduction using retroviruses or other viruses, for example. For bacterial cells, suitable
   techniques may include calcium chloride transformation, electroporation, and transfection
   using bacteriophage. The introduction may be followed by causing or allowing expression
25 from the nucleic acid, e.g. by culturing host cells under conditions for expression of the gene.
   In one embodiment, the nucleic acid of the invention is integrated into the genome, e.g.,
   chromosome, of the host cell. Integration may be promoted by inclusion of sequences which
   promote recombination with the genome, in accordance with standard techniques.
           Systems for cloning and expression of a polypeptide in a variety of different host cells
30 are well known. Suitable host cells include bacteria, mammalian cells, plant cells, insect
                                                  24

   cells, fungi, yeast and transgenic plants and animals. Mammalian cell lines available in the
   art for expression of a heterologous polypeptide include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells,
   HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney cells, mouse melanoma cells, rat myeloma cells, human
   embryonic kidney cells, human embryonic retina cells, and many others. The expression of
 5 antibodies and antibody fragments in prokaryotic cells, such as . coli, is well established in
   the art. For a review, see for example, Plickthun Bio/Technology 9: 545-551 (1991).
   Expression in cultured eukaryotic cells is also available to those skilled in the art, as reviewed
   in Andersen et al. (2002) Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 13: 117-23, for example.
            Antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof may be glycosylated, either naturally
10 or the choice of expression host, e.g., CHO or NSO (ECACC 85110503) cells, or they may
   be unglycosylated, for example if produced by expression in a prokaryotic cell.
   Glycosylation may also be intentionally altered, for example by inhibiting fucosylation, in
   order to increase ADCC activity of the resulting antibody.
   Methods of Using Antibodies or Antigen-Binding Fragments Thereof
15          The present antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof may be used in a method
   of treatment or diagnosis of the human or animal body, such as a method of treatment (which
   may include prophylactic treatment) of a disease or disorder in a human patient, which
   comprises administering an effective amount to the patient. Treatable conditions include any
   in which TGF3 plays a role, e.g., fibrotic disease, cancer, an immune-mediated disease, and
20 wound healing.
            The present antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof are useful to treat a
   disease and condition resulting directly or indirectly from TGF3 activity. The present
   antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof may selectively inhibit the activity of a
   human TGF3 isoform in vitro or in vivo. Activities of TGF3 isoforms include, but are not
25 limited to, TGF -mediated signaling, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, inhibiting
   epithelial and endothelial cell proliferation, promoting smooth muscle proliferation, inducing
   Type III collagen expression, inducing TGF-P, fibronectin, VEGF, and IL- 11 expression,
   binding Latency Associated Peptide, tumor-induced immunosuppression, promotion of
   angiogenesis, activating myofibroblasts, promotion of metastasis, and inhibition of NK cell
                                                    25

   activity. For example, the present antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof are useful
   to treat focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), hepatic fibrosis (HF), acute myocardial
   infarction (AMI), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), scleroderma (SSc), and Marfan
   Syndrome.
 5          The antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof are useful to treat diseases and
   conditions including, but not limited to, fibrotic diseases (such as glomerulonephritis, neural
   scarring, dermal scarring, pulmonary fibrosis, lung fibrosis, radiation induced fibrosis,
   hepatic fibrosis, myelofibrosis), bums, immune mediated diseases, inflammatory diseases
   (including rheumatoid arthritis), transplant rejection, cancer, Dupuytren's contracture, and
10 gastric ulcers. They are also useful for treating, preventing and reducing the risk of
   occurrence of renal insufficiencies including but not limited to: diabetic (type I and type II)
   nephropathy, radiation-induced nephropathy, obstructive nephropathy, diffuse systemic
   sclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, allograft rejection, hereditary renal disease (e.g., polycystic
   kidney disease, medullary sponge kidney, horseshoe kidney), glomerulonephritis,
15 nephrosclerosis, nephrocalcinosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome,
   Berger's disease, systemic or glomerular hypertension, tubulointerstitial nephropathy, renal
   tubular acidosis, renal tuberculosis, and renal infarction. In particular, they are useful when
   combined with antagonists of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system including, but not
   limited to: renin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Ang II receptor
20 antagonists (also known as "Ang II receptor blockers"), and aldosterone antagonists.
   Methods for using antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof in combination with such
   antagonists are set forth in WO 2004/098637, for example.
            The antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof also are useful to treat diseases
   and conditions associated with the deposition of ECM, including, systemic sclerosis,
25 postoperative adhesions, keloid and hypertrophic scarring, proliferative vitreoretinopathy,
   glaucoma drainage surgery, corneal injury, cataract, Peyronie's disease, adult respiratory
   distress syndrome, cirrhosis of the liver, post myocardial infarction scarring, post angioplasty
   restenosis, scarring after subarachnoid hemorrhage, multiple sclerosis, fibrosis after
   laminectomy, fibrosis after tendon and other repairs, scarring due to tattoo removal, biliary
30 cirrhosis (including sclerosing cholangitis), pericarditis, pleurisy, tracheostomy, penetrating
                                                   26

   central nervous system injury, eosinophilic myalgic syndrome, vascular restenosis, veno
   occlusive disease, pancreatitis and psoriatic arthropathy.
            The antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof further are useful to promote re
   epithelialization in diseases and conditions such as venous ulcers, ischaemic ulcers (pressure
 5 sores), diabetic ulcers, graft sites, graft donor sites, abrasions and bums, diseases of the
   bronchial epithelium, such as asthma, ARDS, diseases of the intestinal epithelium, such as
   mucositis associated with cytotoxic treatment, esophageal ulcers (reflux disease), stomach
   ulcers, small intestinal and large intestinal lesions (inflammatory bowel disease).
            The antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof also may be used to promote
10 endothelial cell proliferation, for example, in stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques, promoting
   healing of vascular anastomoses, or to inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation, such as in
   arterial disease, restenosis and asthma.
            The antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof are useful to enhance the immune
   response to macrophage-mediated infections. They are also useful to reduce
15 immunosuppression caused, for example, by tumors, AIDS, or granulomatous diseases. The
   antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof are useful to treat hyperproliferative diseases,
   such as cancers including, but not limited to, breast, prostate, ovarian, stomach, renal,
   pancreatic, colorectal, skin, lung, cervical and bladder cancers, glioma, mesothelioma, as well
   as various leukemias and sarcomas, such as Kaposi's sarcoma, and are useful to treat or
20 prevent recurrences or metastases of such tumors. Antibodies or antigen-binding fragments
   thereof also are useful to inhibit cyclosporin-mediated metastases.
            In the context of cancer therapy, "treatment" includes any medical intervention
   resulting in the slowing of tumor growth or reduction in tumor metastases, as well as partial
   remission of the cancer in order to prolong life expectancy of a patient.
25          Methods of treatment comprise administering an antibody or antigen-binding
   fragment thereof or pharmaceutical compositions comprising the antibody or antigen-binding
   fragment thereof. The antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof may be used in the
   manufacture of a medicament for administration. For example, a method of making a
   medicament or pharmaceutical composition comprises formulating an antibody or antigen
30 binding fragment thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. A composition may
                                                     27

   be administered alone or in combination with other treatments, either simultaneously or
   sequentially dependent upon the condition to be treated.
           Administration is preferably in a "therapeutically effective amount" sufficient to show
   benefit to a patient. Such benefit may be at least amelioration of at least one symptom of a
 5 particular disease or condition. The actual amount administered, and rate and time-course of
   administration, will depend on the nature and severity of the disease or condition being
   treated. Prescription of treatment, e.g., decisions on dosage etc., may be determined based on
   preclinical and clinical studies the design of which is well within the level of skill in the art.
           The precise dose will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the
10 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof is for diagnosis or for treatment, the size and
   location of the area to be treated, the precise nature of the antibody or antigen-binding
   fragment thereof, e.g., whole antibody, Fab, or scFv fragment, and the nature of any
   detectable label or other molecule attached to the antibody or antigen-binding fragment
   thereof. A typical dose of a whole antibody, for example, can be in the range 100 pg to 1 gm
15 for systemic applications, and 1 pg to 1 mg for topical applications. The dose for a single
   treatment of an adult patient may be adjusted proportionally for children and infants, and also
   adjusted for other antibody formats in proportion to molecular weight and activity.
   Treatments may be repeated at daily, twice-weekly, weekly, monthly or other intervals, at the
   discretion of the physician. Treatment may be periodic, and the period between
20 administrations is about two weeks or more, preferably about three weeks or more, more
   preferably about four weeks or more, or about once a month.
           Dose levels of about 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 15 mg per kg body weight of the patient are
   expected to be useful and safe. For example, 0.5-5 mg/kg in rat and mouse has been an
   effective dose in an acute setting. Therefore, for long-term dosing, 0.3-10 mg/kg may be
25 administered to humans, based on an expected half-life of 21 days. Doses may be sufficient
   for efficacy, while low enough to facilitate optimal administration. For example, a dose of
   less than 50 mg facilitates subcutaneous administration. Intravenous administration may be
   used as the route of delivery for severe diseases, where high doses and the long dosing
   intervals may be required. Subcutaneous injection can increase the potential immune
30 response to a product. Local administration for localized disease can reduce the amount of
                                                    28

   administered product and increase the concentration at the site of action, which can improve
   safety.
            An antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof may be administered by injection,
   for example, subcutaneously, intravenously, intracavity (e.g., after tumor resection),
 5 intralesionally, intraperitoneally, or intramuscularly. An antibody or antigen-binding
   fragment thereof also may be delivered by inhalation or topically (e.g., intraocular, intranasal,
   rectal, into wounds, on skin), or orally.
            Antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof will usually be administered in the
   form of a pharmaceutical composition, which may comprise at least one component in
10 addition to the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof. Thus pharmaceutical
   compositions may comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, buffer,
   stabilizer or other materials well known to those skilled in the art. Such materials should be
   non-toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. Such materials
   could include, for example, any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and
15 antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents. Some examples of
   pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, dextrose,
   glycerol, ethanol and the like, as well as combinations thereof. In many cases, it will be
   preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols, such as mannitol,
   sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Additional examples of pharmaceutically
20 acceptable substances are wetting agents or auxiliary substances, such as emulsifying agents,
   preservatives or buffers, which increase the shelf life or effectiveness.
            The precise nature of the carrier or other material will depend on the route of
   administration. For intravenous injection, or injection at the site of affliction, the active
   ingredient will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous solution which is pyrogen
25 free and has suitable pK, isotonicity, and stability. Those of relevant skill in the art are well
   able to prepare suitable solutions using, for example, isotonic vehicles such as sodium
   chloride injection, Ringer's injection, and lactated Ringer's injection. Preservatives,
   stabilizers, buffers, antioxidants and/or other additives may be included.
            An antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof may be formulated in liquid, semi
30 solid or solid forms such as liquid solutions (e.g., injectable and infusible solutions),
                                                    29

   dispersions or suspensions, powders, liposomes, and suppositories. The preferred form
   depends on the intended mode of administration, therapeutic application, the physicochemical
   properties of the molecule, and the route of delivery. Formulations may include excipients,
   or combinations of excipients, for example: sugars, amino acids and surfactants. Liquid
 5 formulations may include a wide range of antibody concentrations and pH. Solid
   formulations may be produced by lyophilization, spray drying, or drying by supercritical fluid
   technology, for example.
            Therapeutic compositions can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, dispersion,
   liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. Sterile injectable
10 solutions can be prepared by incorporating the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof
   in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above,
   followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the
   active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and other
   ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation
15 of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and
   freeze-drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired
   ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The proper fluidity of a solution
   can be maintained, for example, by using a coating such as lecithin, by maintaining the
   particle size of a dispersion, or by using surfactants. Prolonged absorption of injectable
20 compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays
   absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin.
            In certain embodiments, the active compound may be prepared with a carrier that will
   protect the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof against rapid release, such as a
   controlled release formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and
25 microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used,
   such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters,
   and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or
   generally known to those skilled in the art.
            A method of using an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof may comprise
30 causing or allowing binding to TGF3. Such binding may take place in vivo, e.g., following
                                                   30

   administration of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof to a patient, or it may take
   place in vitro, e.g., in ELISA, Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, immunoprecipitation,
   affinity chromatography, or cell based assays, or in ex vivo based therapeutic methods, e.g.,
   methods in which cells or bodily fluids are contacted ex vivo with an antibody or antigen
 5 binding fragment thereof and then administered to a patient.
            A kit comprising an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof is provided. The
   antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof may be labeled to allow its reactivity in a
   sample to be determined. Kits may be employed in diagnostic analysis, for example. A kit
   may contain instructions for use of the components. Ancillary materials to assist in or to
10 enable performing such a method may be included within the kit.
            The reactivity of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof in a sample may be
   determined by any appropriate means, e.g., radioimmunoassay (RIA). Radioactively labeled
   antigen may be mixed with unlabeled antigen (the test sample) and allowed to bind to the
   antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof. Bound antigen is physically separated from
15 unbound antigen and the amount of radioactive antigen bound to the antibody or antigen
   binding fragment thereof is determined. A competitive binding assay also may be used with
   non-radioactive antigen, using an antigen or an analogue linked to a reporter molecule. The
   reporter molecule may be a fluorochrome, phosphor, or dye. Suitable fluorochromes include
   fluorescein, rhodamine, phycoerythrin and Texas Red. Suitable chromogenic dyes include
20 diaminobenzidine.
            Other reporters include macromolecular colloidal particles or particulate material such
   as latex beads that are colored, magnetic or paramagnetic, and biologically or chemically
   active agents that can directly or indirectly cause detectable signals to be visually observed,
   electronically detected or otherwise recorded. These molecules may be enzymes that catalyze
25 reactions that develop or change colors or cause changes in electrical properties, for example.
   They may be molecularly excitable, such that electronic transitions between energy states
   result in characteristic spectral absorptions or emissions. They may include chemical entities
   used in conjunction with biosensors. Biotin/avidin or biotin/streptavidin and alkaline
   phosphatase detection systems may be employed. The signals generated by antibody-reporter
                                                    31

   conjugates may be used to derive quantifiable absolute or relative data of the relevant
   antibody binding in samples.
           The present invention also provides the use of an antibody or antigen-binding
   fragment thereof for measuring antigen levels in a competition assay. Linking a reporter
 5 molecule to the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof so that a physical or optical
   change occurs on binding is one possibility. The reporter molecule may directly or indirectly
   generate detectable, and preferably measurable, signals. The linkage of reporter molecules
   may be directly or indirectly, covalently, e.g., via a peptide bond or non-covalently. The
   antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof and a protein reporter may be linked by a
10 peptide bond and recombinantly expressed as a fusion protein.
           Further aspects and embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to those
   skilled in the art in the light of the present disclosure, including the following experimental
   exemplification.
                                               EXAMPLE 1
15         Anti-TGFP single chain Fv (scFv) may be prepared according to the following non
   limiting example disclosed in Example 1 of U.S. Patent No. 7,723,486. The neutralization
   potencies for TGF 1, TGFp2, and/or TGFP3 can be increased using mutagenesis and/or
   combinatorial techniques. scFv with improved potencies for TGFP1, TGFP2, and/or TGFP3
   can be generated by selecting and screening phage antibody libraries as described in Example
20 1 of U.S. Patent No. 7,723,486. The scFvs generated in that example were compared to
   IDI 1.16, which is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 7,723,486, in the MLEC proliferation assay.
           In Example 1 of U.S. Patent No. 7,723,486, particular germlines were found to be
   highly represented amongst the population of high potency, TGFP-neutralizing scFvs. These
   were DP-10/1-69 and DP-88/1-e (both members of the VHl germline family) for the heavy
25 chain, and DPK22/A27 (V3 family) for the light chain. These germlines appear to provide a
   structural framework particularly suitable for high potency, TGFP pan-neutralizing
   antibodies. PET1073G12, PET1074B9, and PET1287A1O scFvs showed potencies
   approaching or exceeding those of 1D1 1.16 on all three TGFp isoforms in the MLEC
   proliferation assay.
                                                     32

           The derived amino acid sequences of PET1073G12, PET1074B9, and PET1287A10
   VH and VL gene segments were aligned to the known human germline sequences in the
   VBASE database (Tomlinson, V-BASE sequence directory, MRC Centre for Protein
   Engineering, Cambridge, UK, at hypertext transfer protocol vbase.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk
 5 (1997)), and the closest human germline was identified by sequence similarity. The closest
   human germline gene for the VH gene segment of PET1073G12 and PET1074B9 was
   identified as DP-10/1-69 (VH1 germline family) and the closest human germline gene for the
   VH gene segment of PET1287A10 was identified as DP-88/1-e (VH1 germline family). The
   closest human germline gene for the VL gene segment of PET 1073G12, PET1074B9, and
10 PET1287A10 was identified as DPK22/A27 (V3 germline family). Site-directed
   mutagenesis was used to substitute framework residues that differed from germline to the
   germline residue, provided that such changes did not produce a loss of potency in the MLEC
   proliferation assay of more than three-fold in the resulting antibody on any TGF3 isoform. If
   such a loss of potency was observed, the non-germline framework amino acid was kept in the
15 final antibody.
           In germlined PET1073G12 and germlined PET 1074B9, all framework residues are
   germline except for two residues in VH and one residue in VL. The amino acid sequences
   for germlined PET1073G12 are described in SEQ ID NO: 2 for VH and SEQ ID NO: 7 for
   VL of U.S. Patent No. 7,723,486. The amino acid sequences for germlined PET1074B9 are
20 described in SEQ ID NO: 12 for VH and SEQ ID NO: 17 for VL of U.S. Patent No.
   7,723,486. In germlined PET1287A10, all VH and VL framework residues are germline.
   The amino acid sequences for germlined PET 1287A10 are described in SEQ ID NO: 22 for
   VH and SEQ ID NO: 27 for VL of U.S. Patent No. 7,723,486.
                                             EXAMPLE 2A
25         Neutralization potency of anti-TGF3 antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof
   can be assayed using the TGF3 dependent MLEC proliferation assay disclosed in Example 4
   of U.S. Patent No. 7,723,486. The MLEC proliferation assay is based on an assay described
   by Danielpour et al., J. Cell. Physiol., 13 8:79-86 (1989). This assay works on the principle
   that TGF 1, TGFP2, or TGFP3 added to mink lung epithelial cells inhibits serum induced
30 cell proliferation. Antibodies were tested for neutralization of TGF 11, TGFP2, or TGFP3
                                                    33

   resulting in the restoration of the cell proliferation. Proliferation was measured by the uptake
   of [3H]-thymidine. The potency of the antibody was defined as the concentration of the
   antibody that neutralized a single concentration of TGFP 1, TGF 2, or TGFP3 at a level of
   50% (ICso) in nM.
 5          MLEC proliferation assay protocol: the MLEC line was obtained from the American
   Type Culture Collection (Cat.# CCL-64). Cells were grown in Minimum Essential Media
   (MEM, Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), 1%
   penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) and 1% MEM non-essential amino acids solution (Gibco).
   Confluent cells from T- 175 flasks were dissociated from the flask, spun down, washed, and
10 resuspended in MLEC assay media that was made of MEM containing 1 % FBS, 1%
   penicillin / streptomycin and 1% MEM non-essential amino acids solution. An aliquot of the
   cells was then labeled with trypan blue, counted on a haemocytometer, and the cell stock
   diluted to 1.75x105 cell per ml using assay media. 100 pL of this suspension was added to
   each well of a tissue culture flat-bottomed 96 well plate and incubated for 3 to 5 hours.
15          Preparation of TGF /antibody solutions: working solutions of TGF 1, TGF32, or
   TGF33 at 6 ng/ml (six times the final assay concentration) and antibodies (including controls
   such as 1D11. 16) at three times the final maximum assay concentration were prepared in
   MLEC assay media. The final concentration of TGFP in the assay (1 ng/ml or 40 pM)
   corresponded to the concentration that induced approximately 80% inhibition of cell
20 proliferation compared to the control with no TGFP (i.e., EC8o value).
            Dilution plate set up: samples of test and control antibodies were titrated in 3-fold
   dilution steps in MLEC assay media and incubated in the presence and absence of TGFP 1,
   TGFP2 or TGFP3. All relevant controls were included in every experiment: testing of the
   1D11. 16 and/or reference antibody as appropriate and performing TGFP 1, TGFP2, or TGFP3
25 titrations. Completed plates were left in a humidified tissue culture incubator for 1 hour ±15
   minutes.
            Addition of TGFP/antibody solutions to the plated cells: after the appropriate
   incubation times, 100 pL from each well of the dilution plates were transferred to the plated
   MLEC and the plates returned to the incubator for 44±2 hours. 25 pL of 10 pCi/ml [3H]
                                                     34

   thymidine diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was added to each of the wells (0.25
   pCi/well). The plates were then returned to the incubator for 4 hours ±30 minutes.
            Cell harvesting: 100 pL of trypsin-EDTA (0.25%, Gibco) was added to each well,
   plates were incubated for 10 minutes in the incubator, and cells were harvested using a
 5 Tomtec or Packard 96 well cell harvester.
            Data accumulation and analysis: data from the harvested cells were read using a beta
   plate reader (TopCount, Packard). Data were analyzed to obtain ICso and standard deviation
   values. ICso values were obtained by using the Prism 2.0 (GraphPad) software.
            Results: purified PET1073G12, PET1074B9, and PET1287A1O germlined IgG4s
10 were tested alongside 1D11.16 in the MLEC proliferation assay. IgG4s were produced as
   described in Example 3 of U.S. Patent No. 7,723,486. Mean ICso data for PET1073G12 and
   PET1287A10 IgG4s showed that these antibodies have potencies similar or approaching
   those of 1D11.16 on TGFP 1, TGFP2, and TGFP3.
            Mean ICso data suggests that PET 1074B9 IgG4 is more potent on TGF 1, although a
15 full dose response curve was not obtained in the MLEC assay. By comparison, 1D11. 16
   showed 12% neutralization on TGFP 1 at a concentration of 91 pM, and PET 1074B9 showed
   78% neutralization at a similar concentration of 92 pM.

            Additionally, the TGFP isoform binding affinity of the GC1008 antibody was
20 measured using a Biacore@ 3000 (GE Healthcare) instrument. TGF1 I and TGFP2, produced
   in-house, were diluted to -1 pg/mL in 10 mM acetate, pH 4.5, and TGFP3 (R&D Systems)
   was diluted to -2 pg/mL in 10 mM acetate, pH 4.0. Flowcells 2, 3, and 4 of a CM5 sensor
   chip were covalently immobilized with 50 to 100 RU of TGFP 1, TGFP2, and TGFP3,
   respectively, using the standard amine coupling kit from GE Healthcare. Flowcell 1 was used
25 as a control surface. For kinetic binding analysis, GC1008 was serially diluted 1:3 from 33.3
   nM to 1.2 nM in HBS-EP buffer and injected in triplicate to all four flowcells for 5 min,
   followed by 5 min dissociation in buffer at a 30 pL/min flow-rate. The surface was
   regenerated with two 30 see injections of 40 mM HCl at 75 pL/min. The sensorgrams were
   fit using a 1:1 binding model after subtraction of buffer and control flowcell refractive index

           The biologic efficacy of antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof for treating
   chronic renal disease and other clinical indications can be determined using the rat unilateral
   ureteral obstruction (UUO) model set forth in Example 7 of U.S. Patent No. 7,723,486.
   Adult Sprague Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, N.Y.) weighing 250-280 gram
10 (about 6 weeks) were housed in an air-, temperature-, and light-controlled environment. Rats
   undergoing UUO received a small ventral midline abdominal incision to expose the left
   kidney and upper ureter. The ureter was ligated at the level of the lower pole of the kidney
   with silk suture and a second time at about 0.2 cm below the first one. Sham operated rats
   received the same surgical protocol but without ureteral ligation.
15         The obstructed rats were treated with PBS, a murine pan-neutralizing monoclonal
   antibody (1D1 1), an isotype-matched control antibody (13C4), or a human pan-neutralizing
   TGF-p monoclonal antibody as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 7,723,486. The antibodies were
   administered to the rats intraperitoneally beginning on the day of ureteral ligation for a course
   of 3 weeks. 13C4 and 1D 11 were administered at 5 mg/kg (3 times/week), and the human
20 pan-neutralizing antibody was given to the rats at 5 mg/kg (every 5 days). At the end of 3
   weeks, the rats were sacrificed, the kidneys were perfused with PBS for 3 minutes, and the
   perfused kidneys were harvested for the analysis of mRNA, determination of collagen
   content, and histological examination.
           To assess the extent of tissue fibrosis, total tissue collagen content was determined by
25 biochemical analysis of hydroxyproline in hydrolyzate extracts according to Kivirikko et al.
                                                    36

   A Sircol collagen assay was also performed for total collagen content. The Sircol collagen
   assay measures the amount of total acid/pepsin soluble collagens based on the specific
   binding of Sirius red dye with the side chain of tissue collagen.
           The UUO rats treated with the human pan-neutralizing monoclonal antibody showed a
 5 43.4% reduction in hydroxyproline content (1.98+0.26 pg/mg dry tissue) when compared to
   the PBS treated group (3.5±0.3 pig/mg dry tissue, p<0.05). The lessening in renal fibrosis
   was further supported by the reduction in total solubilized collagen in the affected kidneys, as
   determined by a Sirius red dye based assay (sham: 18.5±2.6, PBS: 69.3±3.8, and human pan
   neutralizing monoclonal antibody: 35.6+5.2 ptg/100 mg tissue, p<0.05 vs. PBS).
10         The ability of a human pan-neutralizing anti-TGF-p monoclonal antibody to reduce
   tissue fibrosis by immunohistochemical examination was also assessed. In control animals,
   ureteral obstruction for three weeks caused widespread disruption of renal tubular
   architecture with marked distension, cellular atrophy and necrosis/apoptosis, tissue
   inflammation and tubulointerstitial expansion with evident fibrosis. There was little evidence
15 of glomerular damage. Rats treated with ID 11 or the human pan-neutralizing monoclonal
   antibody, on the other hand, showed preservation of renal architecture as judged by
   attenuated tubular dilation and disorganization, reduced inflammatory infiltrates (cellularity)
   and diminished tubulointerstitial expansion and fibrosis.
           The effect of treatment with a human pan-neutralizing anti-TGF-p monoclonal
20 antibody on TGF-P regulated gene expression was also measured. TGF-P1 mRNA was
   reduced in the human pan-neutralizing monoclonal antibody-treated UUO animals compared
   to either PBS-treated or 13C4 control antibody-treated animals. A significant decrease in
   mRNA levels for type III collagen also was seen in the obstructed kidneys treated with the
   human and murine anti-TGF-P antibodies as compared to those treated with PBS or 13C4
25 indicating a decrease in collagen synthesis.
           The efficacy of a human pan-neutralizing anti-TGF-P monoclonal antibody to reduce
   auto-induced TGF-p synthesis was further confirmed by measuring the total renal TGF-pl
   protein. Compared to the sham-operated animals, obstructed kidneys exhibited a marked
   increase in total tissue TGF- 1. Obstructed rats dosed with a human pan-neutralizing
30 monoclonal antibody, however, showed 75% reduction of tissue TGF-pl levels, below the
                                                  37

   levels recorded for both control groups. By comparison, the murine 1D 11 antibody reduced
   tissue TGF-P1 levels by 45%, compared to control groups. The above-described results
   demonstrate that the TGF-3 neutralization with a human pan-neutralizing anti-TGF-3
   monoclonal antibody interrupted the TGF-3 autocrine-regulation loop concomitant with
 5 prevention of TGF-3 1 production and collagen III mRNA expression.
           The effect of a human pan-neutralizing anti-TGF-3 monoclonal antibody on the
   expression of smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) was further determined as an indirect indicator
   of TGF-3 inhibition. Smooth muscle actin expression is an indicator of activated
   myofibroblasts, which are associated with tissue fibrosis and produce fibrous connective
10 tissue. TGF-3 is an inducer of the activation and phenotypic transformation of stromal
   fibroblasts and resident epithelial cells to myofibroblastic cells. a-SMA protein was detected
   by standard Western blot analysis.
           When compared with sham-operated animals, rats with obstructed kidneys showed
   dramatic up-regulation in a-SMA protein as measured by western blotting of tissue
15 homogenates. Obstructed rats dosed with a human pan-neutralizing anti-TGF-3 monoclonal
   antibody showed significant reduction (75% compared to PBS controls) in measureable a
   SMA expression.
           These results demonstrate the efficacy of a human pan-neutralizing anti-TGF-3
   monoclonal antibody in reducing collagen deposition in the fibrotic kidneys, clearly
20 indicating that the antibody is a potent inhibitor of renal collagen production and deposition
   in this model of severe renal injury and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Because the process of
   tissue fibrosis in organs such as in lung, liver or kidney possesses common mechanisms or
   pathways, the skilled artisan will appreciate that the antibody is useful in the treatment of
   chronic renal diseases as well as other clinical indications characterized by pathogenic
25 fibrosis.

           The structure of the GC1008(Fab)-TGF 2 complex was determined as follows.
   Recombinant GC 1008(Fab) with a C-terminal His6 tag (SEQ ID NO: 11) was transiently
   expressed in HEK293FS cells and purified over Nickel-NTA affinity resin, followed by size
30 exclusion chromatography. The purified GC1008(Fab) was mixed with TGFP2 homodimer
                                                    38

   and the complex was isolated using size exclusion chromatograph. The GC1008(Fab)
   TGFp2 complex was crystallized in 35% PEG400, 100 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
   acid (pH 6.0) at 20'C and further optimized by seeding and pH optimization. The final data
   set was collected to 2.83A in space group P2 12 12, and the structure was solved using
 5 molecular replacement with the GC1008(Fab)-TGFp3 structure disclosed in Gritter (2008).
   The structure of the GC1008(Fab)-TGFP2 complex is depicted in FIG. 1.

   and the complex was isolated using size exclusion chromatograph. The GC 1009(scFv)
   TGFp l complex was crystallized in 16% PEG 4K, 0.1 M citrate (pH 5.0), 4% 2-propanol at
   21 C. The structure was determined to 3.OOA in space group C2, and the structure was
15 solved using molecular replacement with the GC1008(Fab)-TGFp2 structure determined in
   EXAMPLE 4. The structure of the GC1009(scFv)-TGFP1 complex is depicted in FIG. 2.

           Plasmids encoding either the GC1008 heavy chain or light chain were used as a
   template in PCR-based mutagenesis reactions. Mutations to the encoding DNA were made to
20 create 155 single amino acid substitutions of the encoded heavy chain amino acid sequence
   and one single amino acid substitution of the encoded light chain amino acid sequence. A
   QuikChange@ Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara
   CA) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to create DNA mutations using a
   set of forward and reverse primers, either designed for a specific amino acid or for all 20
25 amino acids with a degenerate codon (NNK). After sequencing confirmation, identified
   mutant DNA was paired with a wild-type light or heavy chain DNA for transfection into an
   Expi293FTM host cell suspension (Life Techonologies Corp., Grand Island, NY). At 4 days
   post-transfection, conditioned media (1 mL) was harvested and purified using a 1 mL Protein
   A PhyTip@ column (PhyNexus, Inc., San Jose, CA) and a PureSpeedTM 12-channel pipette
30 (Rainin Instrument LLC, Oakland, CA). Purified variant antibody samples were analyzed in
                                                  39

   duplicate on a Biacore@ 3000 (GE Healthcare) at 50 nM concentrations, using the 100 RU
   level TGFP 1, 2, and 3 immobilized surfaces. The off-rate (kd) of the variants was divided by
   the ka of the wild-type control to obtain the fold change in the kd. An increase in affinity was
   indicated if (kd var/kd") was less than 1, and a reduction was indicated, if the value was larger
 5 than 1. A heat map was generated to visualize the results. Variants that completely lost
   affinity for TGFP were shown in black without numbers. The results are shown in TABLES
   7A, 7B and 7C.

        The heat map analysis of TABLE 7 is visualized in FIG. 5, which shows the 3D
structure of GC 1008 bound to TGF3. The gray chain represents GC 1008, and the black chain
represents TGF3 2. Residues 152, 154, and V55 are labeled black letters; residues Y27, S3 1,
N32, and D56 are labeled in gray; and residues S30 and E74 are labeled in white according to
the color scheme used for the heat map analysis, shown at the bottom of TABLE 7A. An
additional six residues labeled in smaller font, P53, N59, G101, V103. L104, and A93 (light
chain), are similarly colored according to the heat map analysis. Based on the mutagenesis
analysis, the most sensitive positions (152, 154, V55 in black letters) are paratope residues
interacting with the core of the completely conserved TGF3 hydrophobic patch region,
whereas the most tolerant positions (S30, E74 in white letters) are further away and interact
with the TGF3 helix three region.
