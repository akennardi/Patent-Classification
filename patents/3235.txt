PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION
[0043] FIG. 1 through FIG. 6 show an embodiment electrical plug device 100 that includes: a
main body (or frame) element 110;
        a moulded portion 120 within the main body element 110; the moulded portion 120
defines a plurality of through apertures 122;
        a plurality of electrical terminal elements 130 that are each received within a respective
one of the through apertures 122; and
    a seal element 140 for restricting fluid ingress through the plug device.
[0044] In an embodiment, the plug device may further include a cover element 150.

                                                   6
[0045] The moulded portion 120 can be insert moulded within the main body element 110.
Alternatively, the moulded portion 120 may be separately moulded and inserted into the main
body element 110.
[0046] The moulded portion 120 can be moulded with, or machined to form, the through
apertures 122.
[0047] Each electrical terminal element 130 can be elongated (e.g. typically generally cylindrical
in shape) and retained within a respective one of the through apertures 122, such that a first end
131 protrudes from the moulded portion 120 to enable engagement with an electric power supply
via a respective socket (not shown) when in use. The first end 131 may be chamfered, tapered or
rounded for aiding insertion into the respective socket. Each electrical terminal element 130 has
a second end 132 that can be electrically coupled to an internal component of a cordless
appliance such as, for example, a resistance heating element (see Figure 10). Referring to Figure
2, the second end 132 of each electrical terminal element forms an exposed portion of a
respective electrical terminal element 130. The electrical terminal elements 130 can be retained
using a nut and bolt configuration, as best shown in FIG. 6B, using a threaded nut 134 that
engages an intermediate threaded portion 135 of the electrical terminal element. Alternatively,
the electrical terminal elements 130 may threadedly engage the moulded portion 120. A fixing
element (or screw) 152 may be engaged about the second end 132 of each of the electrical
terminal elements 130 to facilitate the electrical coupling. By way of example, the fixing element
(or screw) 152 may engage an aperture 136 at the second end 132 of each of the electrical
terminal element 130. Alternatively, each of the electrical terminal elements 130 may be welded
or soldered to a selected wire to form an electrical coupling.
[0048] The electrical terminal elements 130 may be shaped about an intermediate portion 138 to
resist rotation within (or pulling through) a respective through aperture 122.
[0049] The cover element 150 may include moulded shield elements 154 about the fixing
element (or screw) 152 to assist in isolation of electrical couplings. The cover element 150
provides a second fixing (or "anchor") point for retaining or containing the electrical terminal
elements 130 to restrict movement or wobbling. For example, a first fixing (or "anchor") point
for the electrical terminal elements is about the nut 134. By providing a second anchor point,

                                                  7
each electrical terminal element 130 is better able to resist wobbling when the cordless appliance
is in use.
[0050] The seal element 140 may comprise a separately moulded silicone seal that is added
about the electrical terminal elements 130 and compressed between the moulded portions 120
and cover element 150 to form a seal for restricting fluid ingress through the plug device 100.
For example, fluid may enter the cordless appliance though the plug device 100 because of
manufacturing tolerances between the elements, wherein the seal element 140 restricts further
fluid ingress into the cordless appliance. Alternatively, the seal element 140 may be applied as a
wet silicone seal element that is potted or poured about the electrical terminal elements 130. The
seal element 140 provides a seal about the main body element 110 and the electrical terminal
elements 130.
[0051] The main body element 110 can define a perimeter of the plug device 100, and may have
an outwardly extending peripheral flange 112 for enabling laser welding or bonding of the plug
device 100 to a cordless appliance. An alternative embodiment may include the addition of a
gasket between the peripheral flange 112 and a vessel base 224 (see Figures 9 and 10) and fixing
the plug device 100 with mechanical fasteners.
[0052] The main body element 110 can have an inwardly directed protrusion (or peripheral
flange) 114 for restraining the moulded portion 120. It will be appreciated that the inwardly
directed protrusion (or peripheral flange) 114 would physically retain an insert-moulded portion
120.
[0053] The main body element 110 can have an internal ledge (or rebate) 116 that is located
proximal to the level of the moulded portion 120, such that the upper surface of the moulded
portion 120 is substantially aligned with the ledge 116. It will be appreciated that this
configuration enables the seal element 140 to span across a substantially smooth transition
between the moulded portion 120 and body element 110. The moulded portion 120 may include
a recessed area 124 about the through apertures 122 for receiving the locking nut 134, which can
allow the locking nut 134 to also finish substantially level with the moulded portion 120.
[0054] The main body element 110 can form an upper peripheral wall 118, such that the cover
element 150 is fitted over the upper peripheral wall 118.

                                                   8
[0055] By way of example, two additional mounting through holes 113 are formed at the ends of
the outwardly extending peripheral 112 flange as a guide during the assembly an electrical
appliance.
[0056] FIG. 7A through FIG. 7G show construction of an example embodiment electrical plug
device 100. FIG. 7A shows a main body (or frame) element 110 in the form of a cast stainless
steel element that is machined to size for insert moulding. Alternatively, the main body element
110 can be made of any metal material or polymer. FIG. 7B shows a moulded portion 120
formed by insert moulding a Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), or other engineering polymer, portion
within the main body element 110. The insert moulding material isolates the electrical terminal
elements 130 from the main body element 110, to prevent short circuit. In this example, the
insert moulded portion 120 is cast with through apertures 122 for receiving respective electrical
terminal elements 130. The moulded portion 120 may include a recessed area 124 about the
through apertures 122 for receiving the locking nut 134 (not shown), which can allow the
locking nut 134 to also finish substantially level with the moulded portion 120. FIG. 7C shows
electrical terminal elements 130 inserted through blind holes in the insert moulded portion 120.
FIG. 7D shows locking nuts 134 engaged to a threaded portion 135 of the electrical terminal
elements 130 for mechanical location and retention within the insert moulded portion 120. FIG.
7E shows a separately moulded silicone seal element 140 added atop the moulded portion 120,
which is compressed to a sealed configuration. In an alternative embodiment, a wet silicone seal
element may be potted or poured about the electrical terminal elements 130 for forming a seal.
FIG. 7F shows an installed cover element 150. FIG. 7G shows coupling screw elements 152
installed to secure both the electrical couplings and cover element 150 (wiring assembly not
shown). By way of example, the fixing element (or screw) 152 acts on the cover element 150 to
compress the silicone seal element 140 into a sealed configuration between the cover element
150 and moulded portion 120 and/or main body (or frame) element 110.
[0057] It will be appreciated that the specified materials are provided by way of example only,
and alternative suitable materials may be selected.
[0058] It will also be appreciated that the illustrated embodiment plug device 100 is an electrical
connector that can be used in an electrical appliance such as, for example, a cordless appliance.

                                                   9
[0059] FIG. 8 through FIG. 10, show an electrical appliance 200 having a vessel 220, a base 400
(see Figure 10), and a plug device 100 as described above for enabling electrical connection
between the vessel 220 and the base 400.
[0060] The plug device 100 may be located on or about an underside of the vessel 220. The plug
device 100 may be adhesively bonded or welded to the underside of the vessel 220. It will be
appreciated that the electrical appliance 200 is a cordless appliance.
[0061] In this embodiment, the vessel 220 has a vessel inner wall 222, a vessel outer wall 223,
and a vessel base 224 that is electrically heated by a resistance heating element 226 located
about, or coupled to, the vessel base 224; wherein the plug device 100 enables electrical
connection for power to the heating element 226. The vessel 220 and/or the vessel base 224 are
typically formed of a metal material such as, for example, stainless steel, but may be formed of
plastics, glass or the like. By way of example, the plug device 100 is fixed to the vessel base 224
by laser welding (at 230) the main body element 110 of the plug device 100 to the base of the
vessel. The vessel outer wall 223 may also be laser welded to the vessel base 224 (at 232).
[0062] Referring to Figure 10, the vessel base 224 and the vessel 220 define a volume 235 in
which the resistance heating element 226 is disposed and coupled to the vessel 220. It can be
seen from this figure that each of the electrical terminal elements 130 extend through the main
body element 110 and the moulded portion 120 such that the first end 131 of each electrical
terminal element 130 is external to the volume 235 and the second end 132 (i.e. the exposed
portion) of each electrical terminal element 130 is disposed within the volume 235. The second
end 132 (i.e. the exposed portion) of one of electrical terminal elements 130 is electrically
connected to the heating element 226 within the volume 235 via an electrical conductor 236.
[0063] Disposed in the volume 235 of the vessel 220 is a processor module 237 and a heat
sensor 238. The processor module 237 is electrically connected to the heat sensor and the
second end 132 of at least one of the electrical terminal elements 130 of the plug device 100.
The heat sensor 238 provides temperature information to the processor module 237, and the
processor module 237 controls the operation of the heating element 226 based on the
temperature information. For example, the processor module 237 is configured to increase and
decrease the amount of electrical power delivered to the heating element 226 based on the
temperature information provided by the heat sensor 238.

                                                   10
[0064] The base 400 is configured to removably engage the vessel base 224 to provide electrical
power to the vessel 220. The base 400 being configured to connect to an electrical power supply
such as, for example, mains electricity.
[0065] The base 400 has a socket 402 having a plurality of electrical contacts 404 disposed
therein. The socket 402 is configured to receive the electrical terminal elements 130 of the plug
device 100 therein. When the vessel base 224 is received by the base 400, each of the electrical
contacts 404 electrically contacts one of the plurality of electrical terminal elements 130 of the
plug device 100. When the base 400 is connected to the electrical power supply, at least one of
the electrical contacts is electrically coupled to the electrical power supply.
[0066] The base 400 comprises a processor module 406 that is electrically connected to at least
one of the electrical contacts 404 with an electrical conductor 408. The electrical conductor 408
is configured to transmit control signals from the processor module 406 to at least one of the
electrical contacts 404. The processor module 406 is configured to receive inputs from a user
and control operation of the electrical appliance 200 based on the user inputs.
[0067] When the vessel base 224 engages the base 400, it will be appreciated that the processor
module 237 is electrically connected to the processor module 406 via at least one of the plurality
of electrical terminal elements 130 of the plug device 100. Accordingly, the processor module
406 can transmit the user inputs to the processor module 237 via at least one of the plurality of
electrical terminal elements 130 of the plug device 100 so that the processor module 237 is able
to control the heating element 226 according to the user input. Further, when the vessel base 224
engages the base 400, it will be appreciated that the electrical power supply will be electrically
connected to the second end 132 of at least one of the electrical terminal elements 130 of the
plug device 100 and that the plug device 100 will therefore be able to deliver electrical power to
the vessel 220, the heating element 226, the processor module 237, and the heat sensor 238 via at
least one of the electrical terminal elements 130.
[0068] Referring to FIG. 9, by way of example, the plug device 100 can be kidney-shaped, with
a first side 112 being concave and a second side 113 being convex and being joined by with
rounded ends 114, 115. In this embodiment the sides 112, 113 are concentric with the vessel base
224. In an embodiment, the plurality of electrical terminal elements 130 may be evenly spaced
on an arc that is concentric with the sides of the plug device 100 and the vessel base 224. In an

                                                  11
alternative embodiment, the mains power terminal elements (active, neutral and earth) may be
adjacent but spaced further apart than the other signal electrical terminals. The extra distance
between the power terminal elements increases their respective insulation, and minimises the
possibility of a short circuit due to power terminals operating at higher voltages. The plug device
100 can include two or more electrical terminal elements 130, and preferably 5 or 6 electrical
terminal elements 130.
[0069] Each electrical terminal element 130 may be associated with signal connections or power
connections. The plug device 100 can enable the processor module 237 or other components
(e.g. the heat sensor 238) within the vessel 220 to receive power from, or transmit control signals
to and from, the base 400.
[0070] FIG. 11 is a section part elevation view of another embodiment of an electrical appliance
300, which has an alternative attachment for a plug connector 100.
[0071] In this embodiment, the plug device 100 is mechanically fixed to the base of the vessel
224, and a gasket 310 is used between the outwardly extending peripheral flange 112 of the main
body element 110 and the base of the vessel. For example, the mechanical fixing between the
plug device 100 and base of the vessel can use screws, pins, bolts, nuts or the like.
[0072] In this example embodiment, the outwardly extending peripheral flange 112 is located
beneath the base of the vessel with the gasket 310 there-between.
[0073] Alternatively, by way of example only, the plug device 100 may be placed from inside
the base of the vessel, whereby the outwardly extending peripheral flange 112 is located above
the base of the vessel with the gasket 310 there-between.
[0074] It will be appreciated that the gasket 310 may be formed of known materials that are
suitable for limiting water ingress between the connector and base of the vessel.
[0075] Welding the main body element 110 to the vessel 220 may reduce/restrict the ingress of
moisture, food, and the like into the plug device 100, which may therefore improve the overall
safety and hygiene of the electrical appliance 200. This is because moisture is restricted from
contacting the electrical terminal elements 130 and food is restricted from reaching places where
is cannot easily be removed from the electrical appliance 200.

                                                    12
[0076] Although the invention has been described with reference to specific examples, it will be
appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many other forms.
[0077] Reference throughout this specification to "one embodiment" or "an embodiment" means
that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment
is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, appearances of the phrases
"in one embodiment" or "in an embodiment" in various places throughout this specification are
not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment, but may. Furthermore, the particular
features, structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner, as would be
apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art from this disclosure, in one or more embodiments.
[0078] In the claims below and the description herein, any one of the terms comprising,
comprised of or which comprises is an open term that means including at least the
elements/features that follow, but not excluding others. Thus, the term comprising, when used in
the claims, should not be interpreted as being limitative to the means or elements or steps listed
thereafter. For example, the scope of the expression a device comprising A and B should not be
limited to devices consisting only of elements A and B. Any one of the terms including or which
includes or that includes as used herein is also an open term that also means including at least the
elements/features that follow the term, but not excluding others. Thus, including is synonymous
with and means comprising.
[0079] Similarly, it is to be noticed that the term coupled, when used in the claims, should not be
interpreted as being limitative to direct connections only. The terms "coupled" and "connected",
along with their derivatives, may be used. It should be understood that these terms are not
intended as synonyms for each other. Thus, the scope of the expression a device A coupled to a
device B should not be limited to devices or systems wherein an output of device A is directly
connected to an input of device B. It means that there exists a path between an output of A and
an input of B which may be a path including other devices or means. "Coupled" may mean that
two or more elements are either in direct physical, or that two or more elements are not in direct
contact with each other but yet still co-operate or interact with each other.
[0080] As used herein, unless otherwise specified the use of the ordinal adjectives "first",
"second", "third", etc., to describe a common object, merely indicate that different instances of

                                                   13
like objects are being referred to, and are not intended to imply that the objects so described must
be in a given sequence, either temporally, spatially, in ranking, or in any other manner.
[0081] As used herein, unless otherwise specified the use of terms "horizontal", "vertical",
"left", "right", "up" and "down", as well as adjectival and adverbial derivatives thereof (e.g.,
"horizontally", "rightwardly", "upwardly", etc.), simply refer to the orientation of the illustrated
structure as the particular drawing figure faces the reader, or with reference to the orientation of
the structure during nominal use, as appropriate. Similarly, the terms "inwardly" and
"outwardly" generally refer to the orientation of a surface relative to its axis of elongation, or
axis of rotation, as appropriate.
[0082] Similarly it should be appreciated that in the above description of exemplary
embodiments of the invention, various features of the invention are sometimes grouped together
in a single embodiment, figure, or description thereof for the purpose of streamlining the
disclosure and aiding in the understanding of one or more of the various inventive aspects. This
method of disclosure, however, is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed
invention requires more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather, as the
following claims reflect, inventive aspects lie in less than all features of a single foregoing
disclosed embodiment. Thus, the claims following the Detailed Description are hereby expressly
incorporated into this Detailed Description, with each claim standing on its own as a separate
embodiment of this invention.
[0083] Furthermore, while some embodiments described herein include some but not other
features included in other embodiments, combinations of features of different embodiments are
meant to be within the scope of the invention, and form different embodiments, as would be
understood by those in the art. For example, in the following claims, any of the claimed
embodiments can be used in any combination.
[0084] Furthermore, some of the embodiments are described herein as a method or combination
of elements of a method that can be implemented by a processor of a computer system or by
other means of carrying out the function. Thus, a processor with the necessary instructions for
carrying out such a method or element of a method forms a means for carrying out the method or
element of a method. Furthermore, an element described herein of an apparatus embodiment is

                                                   14
an example of a means for carrying out the function performed by the element for the purpose of
carrying out the invention.
[0085] In the description provided herein, numerous specific details are set forth. However, it is
understood that embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In
other instances, well-known methods, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in
order not to obscure an understanding of this description.
[0086] Thus, while there has been described what are believed to be the preferred embodiments
of the invention, those skilled in the art will recognize that other and further modifications may
be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the invention, and it is intended to claim all
such changes and modifications as fall within the scope of the invention. For example, any
formulas given above are merely representative of procedures that may be used. Functionality
may be added or deleted from the block diagrams and operations may be interchanged among
functional blocks. Steps may be added or deleted to methods described within the scope of the
present invention.
[0087] It will be appreciated that an embodiment of the invention can consist essentially of
features disclosed herein. Alternatively, an embodiment of the invention can consist of features
disclosed herein. The invention illustratively disclosed herein suitably may be practiced in the
absence of any element which is not specifically disclosed herein.
