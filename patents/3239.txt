      Field of the Invention
              Provided herein are methods, compounds, and compositions for reducing expression of
     huntingtin mRNA and protein in an animal. Such methods, compounds, and compositions are
 Lo  useful, for example, to treat, prevent, or ameliorate Huntington's disease.
     Background
             Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative
     disease caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion encoding an abnormally long
     polyglutamine (PolyQ) tract in the huntingtin protein. The Huntington disease gene was first
 .5  mapped in 1993 (The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group. Cell. 1993, 72:971
     83), consisting of a gene, IT15, which contained a polymorphic trinucleotide repeat that is
     expanded and unstable on HD chromosomes. Although CAG repeats in the normal size range are
     usually inherited as Mendelian alleles, expanded HD repeats are unstable through meiotic
     transmission and are found to be expanded beyond the normal size range (6-34 repeat units) in
A0   HD patients.
             Both normal and variant huntingtin protein are localized chiefly in the cytoplasm of
    neurons (DiFiglia et al., Neuron 1995, 14:1075-81). As a result of excessive polyglutamine
    length, huntingtin protein forms aggregates in the cytoplasm and nucleus of CNS neurons
    (Davies et al., Cell 1997, 90:537-548). Both transgenic animals and genetically modified cell
25  lines have been used to investigate the effects of expanded polyQ repeats on the localization and
    processing of huntingtin. However, it is still unclear whether the formation of aggregates per se
    is the essential cytotoxic step or a consequence of cellular dysfunction.
             HD is characterized by progressive chorea, psychiatric changes and intellectual decline.
    This dominant disorder affects males and females equally, and occurs in all races (Gusella and
30  MacDonald, Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995 5:656-62). Symptoms of HD are due to the death of
                                                       -1-

   neurons in many brain regions, but is most apparent in the striatum, particularly in the caudate
   nucleus, which suffers a progressive gradient of cell loss that ultimately decimates the entire
   structure. Although the gene encoding huntingtin is expressed ubiquitously (Strong, T.V. et al.,
   Nat. Genet. 1995, 5:259-263), selective cell loss and fibrillary astrocytosis is observed in the
 5 brain, particularly in the caudate and putamen of the striatum and in the cerebral cortex of HD
   patients (Vonsattel, J-P. et al., Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1985, 44:559-577), and, to a lesser
   extent, in the hippocampus (Spargo, E. et al., J.Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry 1993, 56:487
   491) and the subthalamus (Byers, R.K. et al., Neurology 1973, 23:561-569).
           Huntingtin is crucial for normal development and may be regarded as a cell survival gene
10 (Nasir et al., Human Molecular Genetics, Vol 5, 1431-1435). The normal function of huntingtin
   remains incompletely characterized, but based upon protein-protein interactions, it appears to be
   associated with the cytoskeleton and required for neurogenesis (Walling et al., J.Neurosci Res.
   1998, 54:301-8). Huntingtin is specifically cleaved during apoptosis by a key cysteine protease,
   apopain, known to play a pivotal role in apoptotic cell death. The rate of cleavage is enhanced by
15 longer polyglutamine tracts, suggesting that inappropriate apoptosis underlies HD.
           Antisense technology is emerging as an effective means for reducing the expression of
   specific gene products and may therefore prove to be uniquely useful in a number of therapeutic,
   diagnostic, and research applications for the modulation of huntingtin expression. (See U.S.
   Patent Publication Nos. 2008/0039418 and 2007/0299027)
20         Antisense compounds for modulating expression of huntingtin are disclosed in the
   aforementioned published patent applications. However, there remains a need for additional such
   compounds.
   Summary of the Invention
           Provided herein are methods, compounds, and compositions for modulating expression of
25 huntingtin and treating, preventing, delaying or ameliorating Huntington's disease and/or a
   symptom thereof.

             Effect of antisense oligonucleotide treatment on the motor performance of BACHD mice
    using the Rotarod assay. BACHD mice were treated with 50 pig/day ICV of ISIS 388241 or PBS
     for two weeks. Control groups of non-transgenic littermates were similarly treated with ISIS
 .5  388241 or PBS. The accelerating Rotarod assay was then performed. Animals were placed on
    the Rotarod at a speed of 2 RPM; the Rotarod accelerated to 40 RPM over 5 minutes. The
    duration to fall was recorded. Baseline values at 6 months age were taken before the treatment
    and the time points given are the age of the mice at which the assay was conducted. The bars
    represent the duration to fall in seconds by BACHD mice treated with ISIS 388241 (black); by
20  BACHD mice treated with PBS (hashed); and by non-transgenic littermates treated with PBS
    (white). ISIS 388241-treated mice displayed increased duration of fall and, therefore, improved
    motor performance on the Rotarod, compared to the PBS control.

  5         Behavioral characterization of antisense oligonucleotide-treated YAC128 mice using the
    Open Field assay. Five month old YAC128 mice were treated with 50 pg/day ICV of ISIS
    388241 or control oligonucleotide ISIS 141923 or PBS for 14 days. A control group of non
    transgenic FVB/NJ littermates were included in the study and not given any treatment. Mice
    were placed in an open field arena that uses photobeam breaks to measure horizontal and vertical
 [o movement over a 30 min test session. Data was analyzed using Activity Monitor software to
    examine total ambulatory movement within the arena and movement within the center of the
    arena as a measure of anxiety. The bars represent time in seconds spent at the center of the field
    by FVB/NJ mice, YAC128 treated with PBS, and, YAC128 mice treated with ISIS 388241.
    YAC128 mice treated with ISIS 388241 spent more time in the center and were therefore

20  of non-transgenic FVB/NJ littermates were included as untreated control. Mice were placed in
    the center of an apparatus which consisted of two open arms and two closed arms each
    measuring 65 x 6.25 cm and elevated 50 cm above the ground. The location of the mice on the
    apparatus and amount of time spent in the open arms was recorded over a 5 minute test session
    as a measure of anxiety. The bars represent the percentage of time spent in the open arms by
25  FVB/NJ control, YAC128 treated with PBS, and YAC128 mice treated with ISIS 388241.
    YAC128 mice treated with ISIS 388241 spent more time in the open arms and were therefore

            In certain embodiments, an antisense compound targeted to a huntingtin nucleic acid is
25 12 to 30 nucleotides in length. In other words, antisense compounds are from 12 to 30 linked

   78, 79, or 80 linked nucleobasis in length, or a range defined by any two of the above values.
            In certain embodiments, the antisense compound comprises a shortened or truncated
   modified oligonucleotide. The shortened or truncated modified oligonucleotide can have a
 5 single nucleoside deleted from the 5' end (5' truncation), or alternatively from the 3' end (3'
   truncation). A shortened or truncated oligonucleotide may have two nucleosides deleted from
   the 5' end, or alternatively may have two subunits deleted from the 3' end. Alternatively, the
   deleted nucleosides may be dispersed throughout the modified oligonucleotide, for example, in
   an antisense compound having one nucleoside deleted from the 5' end and one nucleoside
10 deleted from the 3' end.
            When a single additional nucleoside is present in a lengthened oligonucletide, the
   additional nucleoside may be located at the 5' or 3' end of the oligonucleotide. When two or
   more additional nucleosides are present, the added nucleosides may be adjacent to each other, for
   example, in an oligonucleotide having two nucleosides added to the 5' end (5' addition), or
15 alternatively to the 3' end (3' addition), of the oligonucleotide. Alternatively, the added
   nucleoside may be dispersed throughout the antisense compound, for example, in an
    oligonucleotide having one nucleoside added to the 5' end and one subunit added to the 3' end.
            It is possible to increase or decrease the length of an antisense compound, such as an
    antisense oligonucleotide, and/or introduce mismatch bases without eliminating activity. For
20  example, in Woolf et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:7305-7309, 1992), a series of antisense
    oligonucleotides 13-25 nucleobases in length were tested for their ability to induce cleavage of a
    target RNA in an oocyte injection model. Antisense oligonucleotides 25 nucleobases in length
   with 8 or 11 mismatch bases near the ends of the antisense oligonucleotides were able to direct
    specific cleavage of the target mRNA, albeit to a lesser extent than the antisense oligonucleotides
25  that contained no mismatches. Similarly, target specific cleavage was achieved using 13
    nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides, including those with I or 3 mismatches.
             Gautschi et al (J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 93:463-471, March 2001) demonstrated the ability of
    an oligonucleotide having 100% complementarity to the bcl-2 mRNA and having 3 mismatches
    to the bcl-xL mRNA to reduce the expression of both bcl-2 and bcl-xL in vitro and in vivo.
30  Furthermore, this oligonucleotide demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in vivo.

              Maher and Dolnick (Nuc. Acid. Res. 16:3341-3358,1988) tested a series of tandem 14
     nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides, and a 28 and 42 nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides
     comprised of the sequence of two or three of the tandem antisense oligonucleotides, respectively,
     for their ability to arrest translation of human DHFR in a rabbit reticulocyte assay. Each of the
  5  three 14 nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides alone was able to inhibit translation, albeit at a
    more modest level than the 28 or 42 nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides.
    Antisense CompoundMotifs
              In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to a huntingtin nucleic acid have
    chemically modified subunits arranged in patterns, or motifs, to confer to the antisense
 .0 compounds properties such as enhanced the inhibitory activity, increased binding affinity for a
    target nucleic acid, or resistance to degradation by in vivo nucleases.
             Chimeric antisense compounds typically contain at least one region modified so as to
    confer increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, increased binding
    affinity for the target nucleic acid, and/or increased inhibitory activity. A second region of a
 .5 chimeric antisense compound may optionally serve as a substrate for the cellular endonuclease
    RNase H, which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex.
             Antisense compounds having a gapmer motif are considered chimeric antisense
    compounds. In a gapmer an internal region having a plurality of nucleotides that supports
    RNaseH cleavage is positioned between external regions having a plurality of nucleotides that
 0  are chemically distinct from the nucleosides of the internal region. In the case of an antisense
    oligonucleotide having a gapmer motif, the gap segment generally serves as the substrate for
    endonuclease cleavage, while the wing segments comprise modified nucleosides. In certain
    embodiments, the regions of a gapmer are differentiated by the types of sugar moieties
    comprising each distinct region. The types of sugar moieties that are used to differentiate the
25  regions of a gapmer may in some embodiments include p-D-ribonucleosides, -D
    deoxyribonucleosides, 2'-modified nucleosides (such 2'-modified nucleosides may include 2'
    MOE, and 2'-O-CH 3 , among others), and bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides (such bicyclic
    sugar modified nucleosides may include those having a 4'-(CH2)n-O-2' bridge, where n=1 or
    n=2). Preferably, each distinct region comprises uniform sugar moieties. The wing-gap-wing
30  motif is frequently described as "X-Y-Z", where "X" represents the length of the 5' wing region,
    "Y" represents the length of the gap region, and "Z" represents the length of the 3' wing region.

   As used herein, a gapmer described as "X-Y-Z" has a configuration such that the gap segment is
   positioned immediately adjacent each of the 5' wing segment and the 3' wing segment. Thus, no
   intervening nucleotides exist between the 5' wing segment and gap segment, or the gap segment
   and the 3' wing segment. Any of the antisense compounds described herein can have a gapmer
5  motif. In some embodiments, X and Z are the same, in other embodiments they are different. In
   a preferred embodiment, Y is between 8 and 15 nucleotides. X, Y or Z can be any of 1, 2, 3, 4,

     Target Nucleic Acids, Target Regions and Nucleotide Sequences
              Nucleotide sequences that encode huntingtin include, without limitation, the following:

 L5 GENBANK Accession No. NM_024357.2, first deposited with GENBANK@ on June                        5 th 2008,
    incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 5.
             It is understood that the sequence set forth in each SEQ ID NO in the Examples contained
    herein is independent of any modification to a sugar moiety, an internucleoside linkage, or a
    nucleobase. As such, antisense compounds defined by a SEQ ID NO may comprise,
 .0 independently, one or more modifications to a sugar moiety, an internucleoside linkage, or a
    nucleobase. Antisense compounds described by Isis Number (Isis No) indicate a combination of
    nucleobase sequence and motif.
             In certain embodiments, a target region is a structurally defined region of the target
    nucleic acid. For example, a target region may encompass a 3' UTR, a 5' UTR, an exon, an
25  intron, an exon/intron junction, a coding region, a translation initiation region, translation
    termination region, or other defined nucleic acid region. The structurally defined regions for
    huntingtin can be obtained by accession number from sequence databases such as NCBI and
    such information is incorporated herein by reference. In certain embodiments, a target region
    may encompass the sequence from a 5' target site of one target segment within the target region
30  to a 3' target site of another target segment within the target region.

               Targeting includes determination of at least one target segment to which an antisense
      compound hybridizes, such that a desired effect occurs. In certain embodiments, the desired
      effect is a reduction in mRNA target nucleic acid levels. In certain embodiments, the desired
      effect is reduction of levels of protein encoded by the target nucleic acid or a phenotypic change
 5    associated with the target nucleic acid.
               A target region may contain one or more target segments. Multiple target segments
      within a target region may be overlapping. Alternatively, they may be non-overlapping. In
      certain embodiments, target segments within a target region are separated by no more than about
      300 nucleotides. In certain embodiments, target segments within a target region are separated by
 0    a number of nucleotides that is, is about, is no more than, is no more than about, 250, 200, 150,
       100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, or 10 nucleotides on the target nucleic acid, or is a range
      defined by any two of the preceding values. In certain embodiments, target segments within a
      target region are separated by no more than, or no more than about, 5 nucleotides on the target
      nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, target segments are contiguous. Contemplated are target
 5    regions defined by a range having a starting nucleic acid that is any of the 5' target sites or 3'
      target sites listed herein.
                Suitable target segments may be found within a 5' UTR, a coding region, a 3' UTR, an
       intron, an exon, or an exon/intron junction. Target segments containing a start codon or a stop
       codon are also suitable target segments. A suitable target segment may specifically exclude a
 .0    certain structurally defined region such as the start codon or stop codon.
                The determination of suitable target segments may include a comparison of the sequence
       of a target nucleic acid to other sequences throughout the genome. For example, the BLAST
       algorithm may be used to identify regions of similarity amongst different nucleic acids. This
       comparison can prevent the selection of antisense compound sequences that may hybridize in a
25     non-specific manner to sequences other than a selected target nucleic acid (i.e., non-target or off
       target sequences).
                There may be variation in activity (e.g., as defined by percent reduction of target nucleic
        acid levels) of the antisense compounds within an active target region. In certain embodiments,
        reductions in huntingtin mRNA levels are indicative of inhibition of huntingtin expression.
30      Reductions in levels of a huntingtin protein are also indicative of inhibition of target mRNA
    -   expression. Further, phenotypic changes are indicative of inhibition of huntingtin expression.

   For example, increase in brain size to normal, improvement in motor coordination, decrease in

   phenotypic indications, e.g., symptoms associated with Huntington's disease, may also be
 5 assessed as described below.
   Hybridization
            In some embodiments, hybridization occurs between an antisense compound disclosed
   herein and a huntingtin nucleic acid. The most common mechanism of hybridization involves
   hydrogen bonding (e.g., Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding)
 0 between complementary nucleobases of the nucleic acid molecules.
            Hybridization can occur under varying conditions. Stringent conditions are sequence
   dependent and are determined by the nature and composition of the nucleic acid molecules to be
   hybridized.
            Methods of determining whether a sequence is specifically hybridizable to a target
 5 nucleic acid are well known in the art. In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds
   provided herein are specifically hybridizable with a huntingtin nucleic acid.
    Complementarity
             An antisense compound and a target nucleic acid are complementary to each other when
    a sufficient number of nucleobases of the antisense compound can hydrogen bond with the
20  corresponding nucleobases of the target nucleic acid, such that a desired effect will occur (e.g.,
    antisense inhibition of a target nucleic acid, such as a huntingtin nucleic acid).
             An antisense compound may hybridize over one or more segments of a huntingtin nucleic
    acid such that intervening or adjacent segments are not involved in the hybridization event (e.g.,
    a loop structure, mismatch or hairpin structure).
25           In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds provided herein, or a specified portion
    thereof, are, or are at least, 70%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%,
    95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% complementary to a huntingtin nucleic acid, a target
    region, target segment, or specified portion thereof. Percent complementarity of an antisense
    compound with a target nucleic acid can be determined using routine methods.

             For example, an antisense compound in which 18 of 20 nucleobases of the antisense
   compound are complementary to a target region, and would therefore specifically hybridize,
   would represent 90 percent complementarity. In this example, the remaining noncomplementary
   nucleobases may be clustered or interspersed with complementary nucleobases and need not be
5  contiguous to each other or to complementary nucleobases. As such, an antisense compound
   which is 18 nucleobases in length having 4 (four) noncomplementary nucleobases which are
   flanked by two regions of complete complementarity with the target nucleic acid would have
   77.8% overall complementarity with the target nucleic acid and would thus fall within the scope
    of the present invention. Percent complementarity of an antisense compound with a region of a
0   target nucleic acid can be determined routinely using BLAST programs (basic local alignment
    search tools) and PowerBLAST programs known in the art (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1990,
    215, 403 410; Zhang and Madden, Genome Res., 1997, 7, 649 656). Percent homology,
    sequence identity or complementarity, can be determined by, for example, the Gap program
    (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group,
.5  University Research Park, Madison Wis.), using default settings, which uses the algorithm of
     Smith and Waterman (Adv. Apple. Math., 1981, 2,482 489).
              In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds provided herein, or specified portions
     thereof, are fully complementary (i.e. 100% complementary) to a target nucleic acid, or specified
     portion thereof. For example, antisense compound may be fully complementary to a huntingtin
zo   nucleic acid, or a target region, or a target segment or target sequence thereof. As used herein,
     "fully complementary" means each nucleobase of an antisense compound is capable of precise
     base pairing with the corresponding nucleobases of a target nucleic acid. For example, a 20
     nucleobase antisense compound is fully complementary to a target sequence that is 400
      nucleobases long, so long as there is a corresponding 20 nucleobase portion of the target nucleic
25    acid that is fully complementary to the antisense compound. Fully complementary can also be
      used in reference to a specified portion of the first and /or the second nucleic acid. For example,
      a 20 nucleobase portion of a 30 nucleobase antisense compound can be "fully complementary" to
      a target sequence that is 400 nucleobases long. The 20 nucleobase portion of the 30 nucleobase
                                                                                             has a
      oligonucleotide is fully complementary to the target sequence if the target sequence

     antisense compound may or may not be fully complementary to the target sequence, depending
     on whether the remaining 10 nucleobases of the antisense compound are also complementary to
     the target sequence.
             The location of a non-complementary nucleobase may be at the 5' end or 3' end of the
  5  antisense compound. Alternatively, the non-complementary nucleobase or nucleobases may be
     at an internal position of the antisense compound. When two or more non-complementary
     nucleobases are present, they may be contiguous (i.e. linked) or non-contiguous. In one

     Identity
              The antisense compounds provided herein may also have a defined percent identity to a
     particular nucleotide sequence, SEQ ID NO, or compound represented by a specific Isis number,
     or portion thereof. As used herein, an antisense compound is identical to the sequence disclosed
  5  herein if it has the same nucleobase pairing ability. For example, a RNA which contains uracil
     in place of thymidine in a disclosed DNA sequence would be considered identical to the DNA
     sequence since both uracil and thymidine pair with adenine. Shortened and lengthened versions
     of the antisense compounds described herein as well as compounds having non-identical bases
     relative to the antisense compounds provided herein also are contemplated. The non-identical
 .0  bases may be adjacent to each other or dispersed throughout the antisense compound. Percent
     identity of an antisense compound is calculated according to the number of bases that have
     identical base pairing relative to the sequence to which it is being compared.
              In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds, or portions thereof, are at least 70%,
     75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to one or more of the

    Modifications
             A nucleoside is a base-sugar combination. The nucleobase (also known as base) portion
    of the nucleoside is normally a heterocyclic base moiety. Nucleotides are nucleosides that
    further include a phosphate group covalently linked to the sugar portion of the nucleoside. For
 0  those nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to the
    2', 3' or 5' hydroxyl moiety of the sugar. Oligonucleotides are formed through the covalent
    linkage of adjacent nucleosides to one another, to form a linear polymeric oligonucleotide.
    Within the oligonucleotide structure, the phosphate groups are commonly referred to as forming
    the internucleoside linkages of the oligonucleotide.
25           Modifications to antisense compounds encompass substitutions or changes to
    internucleoside linkages, sugar moieties, or nucleobases. Modified antisense compounds are
    often preferred over native forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced
    cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for nucleic acid target, increased stability in the presence of
    nucleases, or increased inhibitory activity.
30           Chemically modified nucleosides may also be employed to increase the binding affinity
    of a shortened or truncated antisense oligonucleotide for its target nucleic acid. Consequently,
                                                     -32-

     comparable results can often be obtained with shorter antisense compounds that have such
     chemically modified nucleosides.
     Modified InternucleosideLinkages
             The naturally occurring internucleoside linkage of RNA and DNA is a 3' to 5'
  5  phosphodiester linkage. Antisense compounds having one or more modified, i.e. non-naturally
     occurring, internucleoside linkages are often selected over antisense compounds having naturally
     occurring internucleoside linkages because of desirable properties such as, for example,
     enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for target nucleic acids, and increased stability in the
     presence of nucleases.
 to          Oligonucleotides having modified intemucleoside linkages include internucleoside
     linkages that retain a phosphorus atom as well as internucleoside linkages that do not have a
     phosphorus atom. Representative phosphorus containing internucleoside linkages include, but
     are not limited to, phosphodiesters, phosphotriesters, methylphosphonates, phosphoramidate, and
    phosphorothioates. Methods of preparation of phosphorous-containing and non-phosphorous
 .5  containing linkages are well known.
             In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to a huntingtin nucleic acid
     comprise one or more modified intemucleoside linkages. In certain embodiments, the modified
    internucleoside linkages are phosphorothioate linkages. In certain embodiments, each
    internucleoside linkage of an antisense compound is a phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage.
20  Modified Sugar Moieties
             Antisense compounds can optionally contain one or more nucleosides wherein the sugar
    group has been modified. Such sugar modified nucleosides may impart enhanced nuclease
    stability, increased binding affinity or some other beneficial biological property to the antisense
    compounds. In certain embodiments, nucleosides comprise a chemically modified ribofuranose
25  ring moieties. Examples of chemically modified ribofuranose rings include without limitation,
    addition of substitutent groups (including 5' and 2' substituent groups, bridging of non-geminal
    ring atoms to form bicyclic nucleic acids (BNA), replacement of the ribosyl ring oxygen atom
    with S, N(R), or C(Rl)(R)2 (R = H, Cl-C12 alkyl or a protecting group) and combinations
    thereof Examples of chemically modified sugars include 2'-F-5'-methyl substituted nucleoside

     nucleosides comprising 5'-vinyl, 5'-methyl (R or S), 4'-S, 2'-F, 2'-OCH3 and 2'-O(CH2)20CH3
     substituent groups. The substituent at the 2' position can also be selected from allyl, amino,

    N(OCH3)-2' (see PCT/US2008/ 064591); 4'-CH2-0-N(CH3)-2' (see published U.S. Patent
    Application US2004-0171570, published September 2, 2004 ); 4'-CH2-N(R)-O-2' (see U.S.
 .0 Patent 7,427,672, issued on September 23, 2008); 4'-CH2-C(CH3)-2'and 4'-CH2-C,(=CH2)-2'
    (see PCT/US2008/ 066154); and wherein R is, independently, H, Cl-C12 alkyl, or a protecting
    group. Each of the foregoing BNAs include various stereochemical sugar configurations
    including for example a-L-ribofuranose and $-D-ribofuranose (see PCT international application
    PCT/DK98/00393, published on March 25, 1999 as WO 99/14226).
25            In certain embodiments, nucleosides are modified by replacement of the ribosyl ring with
    a sugar surrogate. Such modification includes without limitation, replacement of the ribosyl ring
    with a surrogate ring system (sometimes referred to as DNA analogs) such as a morpholino ring,
    a cyclohexenyl ring, a cyclohexyl ring or a tetrahydropyranyl ring such as one having one of the

              Many other bicyclo and tricyclo sugar surrogate ring systems are also known in the art
     that can be used to modify nucleosides for incorporation into antisense compounds (see, e.g.,
  5  review article: Leumann, J. C, Bioorganic& Medicinal Chemistry, 2002, 10, 841-854). Such
     ring systems can undergo various additional substitutions to enhance activity.
             Methods for the preparations of modified sugars are well known to those skilled in the
     art.
             In nucleotides having modified sugar moieties, the nucleobase moieties (natural,
 tO  modified or a combination thereof) are maintained for hybridization with an appropriate nucleic
     acid target.
             In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to a huntingtin nucleic acid
     comprise one or more nucleotides having modified sugar moieties. In certain embodiments, the
    modified sugar moiety is 2'-MOE. In certain embodiments, the 2'-MOE modified nucleotides
 .5  are arranged in a gapmer motif.
    Modified Nucleobases
             Nucleobase (or base) modifications or substitutions are structurally distinguishable from,
    yet functionally interchangeable with, naturally occurring or synthetic unmodified nucleobases.
    Both natural and modified nucleobases are capable of participating in hydrogen bonding. Such
20  nucleobase modifications may impart nuclease stability, binding affinity or some other beneficial
    biological property to antisense compounds. Modified nucleobases include synthetic and natural
    nucleobases such as, for example, 5-methylcytosine (5-me-C). Certain nucleobase substitutions,
    including 5-methylcytosine substitutions, are particularly useful for increasing the binding
    affinity of an antisense compound for a target nucleic acid. For example, 5-methylcytosine
25  substitutions have been shown to increase nucleic acid duplex stability by 0.6-1.2*C (Sanghvi,
    Y.S., Crooke, S.T. and Lebleu, B., eds., Antisense Research and Applications, CRC Press, Boca
    Raton, 1993, pp. 276-278).

   Zen-Bio, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC; Clonetics Corporation, Walkersville, MD) and cells
   are cultured according to the vendor's instructions using commercially available reagents (e.g.
   Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Illustrative cell types include, but are not limited
.0 to, HepG2 cells, Hep3B cells, primary hepatocytes, A549 cells, GM04281 fibroblasts and LLC
   MK2 cells.
   In vitro testing of antisense oligonucleotides
            Described herein are methods for treatment of cells with antisense oligonucleotides,
    which can be modified appropriately for treatment with other antisense compounds.
L5          In general, cells are treated with antisense oligonucleotides when the cells reach
    approximately 60-80% confluence in culture.
            One reagent commonly used to introduce antisense oligonucleotides into cultured cells
    includes the cationic lipid transfection reagent LIPOFECTIN@ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
    Antisense oligonucleotides are mixed with LIPOFECTIN@ in OPTI-MEM@ 1 (Invitrogen,
20  Carlsbad, CA) to achieve the desired final concentration of antisense oligonucleotide and a
    LIPOFECTIN@ concentration that typically ranges 2 to 12 ug/mL per 100 nM antisense
    oligonucleotide.
             Another reagent used to introduce antisense oligonucleotides into cultured cells includes
     LIPOFECTAMINE 2000@ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Antisense oligonucleotide is mixed with
25   LIPOFECTAMINE 2000@ in OPTI-MEM@ 1 reduced serum medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,

     LIPOFECTAMINE@ concentration that typically ranges 2 to 12 ug/mL per 100 nM antisense
     oligonucleotide.

             Another technique used to introduce antisense oligonucleotides into cultured cells
  5 includes electroporation.
             Cells are treated with antisense oligonucleotides by routine methods. Cells are typically
    harvested 16-24 hours after antisense oligonucleotide treatment, at which time RNA or protein
    levels of target nucleic acids are measured by methods known in the art and described herein. In
    general, when treatments are performed in multiple replicates, the data are presented as the
 .0 average of the replicate treatments.
             The concentration of antisense oligonucleotide used varies from cell line to cell line.
    Methods to determine the optimal antisense oligonucleotide concentration for a particular cell

     QuantitativeReal-Time PCR Analysis of Target RNA Levels
            Quantitation of target RNA levels may be accomplished by quantitative real-time PCR
    using the ABI PRISM@ 7600, 7700, or 7900 Sequence Detection System (PE-Applied
    Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Methods of quantitative
  5 real-time PCR are well known in the art.
            Prior to real-time PCR, the isolated RNA is subjected to a reverse transcriptase (RT)
    reaction, which produces complementary DNA (cDNA) that is then used as the substrate for the
    real-time PCR amplification. The RT and real-time PCR reactions are performed sequentially in
    the same sample well. RT and real-time PCR reagents are obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad,
 [O CA). RT, real-time-PCR reactions are carried out by methods well known to those skilled in the
    art.
            Gene (or RNA) target quantities obtained by real time PCR are normalized using either
    the expression level of a gene whose expression is constant, such as cyclophilin A, or by
    quantifying total RNA using RIBOGREEN (Invitrogen, Inc. Carlsbad, CA). Cyclophilin A
 L5 expression is quantified by real time PCR, by being run simultaneously with the target,
    multiplexing, or separately. Total RNA is quantified using RIBOGREEN RNA quantification
    reagent (Invitrogen, Inc. Eugene, OR). Methods of RNA quantification by RIBOGREEN@ are
    taught in Jones, L.J., et al, (Analytical Biochemistry, 1998, 265, 368-374). A CYTOFLUOR
    4000 instrument (PE Applied Biosystems) is used to measure RIBOGREEN fluorescence.
 to         Probes and primers are designed to hybridize to a huntingtin nucleic acid. Methods for
    designing real-time PCR probes and primers are well known in the art, and may include the use
    of software such as PRIMER EXPRESS Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
    Analysis of Protein Levels
            Antisense inhibition of huntingtin nucleic acids can be assessed by measuring huntingtin
25  protein levels. Protein levels of huntingtin can be evaluated or quantitated in a variety of ways
    well known in the art, such as immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis (immunoblotting),
    enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), quantitative protein assays, protein activity
    assays (for example, caspase activity assays), immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry or
    fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Antibodies directed to a target can be identified and
30  obtained from a variety of sources, such as the MSRS catalog of antibodies (Aerie Corporation,
    Birmingham, MI), or can be prepared via conventional monoclonal or polyclonal antibody

     In vivo testing of antisense compounds
             Antisense compounds, for example, antisense oligonucleotides, are tested in animals to
  5  assess their ability to inhibit expression of huntingtin and produce phenotypic changes. Testing
     may be performed in normal animals, or in experimental disease models. For administration to
     animals, antisense oligonucleotides are formulated in a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, such
     as phosphate-buffered saline. Administration includes parenteral routes of administration.
     Following a period of treatment with antisense oligonucleotides, RNA is isolated from tissue and
 Lo  changes in huntingtin nucleic acid expression are measured. Changes in huntingtin protein levels
     are also measured.

     duration of action). In certain embodiments, methods of specifically localizing a pharmaceutical
     agent, such as by bolus injection, decreases median effective concentration (EC50) by a factor of
     about 50 (e.g. 50 fold less concentration in tissue is required to achieve the same or similar
    pharmacodynamic effect ). In certain embodiments, methods of specifically localizing a

             While certain compounds, compositions and methods described herein have been
     described with specificity in accordance with certain embodiments, the following examples serve
  5  only to illustrate the compounds described herein and are not intended to limit the same. Each of
     the references recited in the present application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
     Example 1: Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to human huntingtin gene sequences
             About seventeen hundred newly designed antisense compounds of various lengths, motifs
     and backbone composition targeting the human huntingtin gene sequence were tested for their
 .0  effect on human huntingtin mRNA in vitro in several cell types. These gapmers were further
     designed with internucleoside linkages that are either only phosphorothioate linkages (described
     in Table 1) or that are phosphorothioate and phosphodiester linkages (described in Table 5). A
     number of the newly designed oligos and two benchmark oligonucleotides (previously designed
     and disclosed) are provided in Tables 1 and 5.
 .5  Gapmers with fully phosphorothioateinternucleosidelinkages
             Certain of the compounds presented in Table 1 have a motif of 5-10-5 MOE, 6-8-6 MOE,
     or 5-8-5 MOE. The 5-10-5 gapmers have twenty linked nucleosides, wherein the central gap
     segment has ten 2'-deoxynucleosides and is flanked on both sides (in the 5' and 3' directions) by
     wings having five nucleosides each. The 6-8-6 gapmer has twenty linked nucleosides, wherein
20  the central gap segment has eight 2'-deoxynucleosides and is flanked on both sides (in the 5' and
    3' directions) by wings having six nucleosides each. The 5-8-5 gapmers have eighteen linked
    nucleosides, wherein the central gap segment has eight 2'-deoxynucleosides and is flanked on
    both sides (in the 5' and 3' directions) by wings having five nucleosides each. For all gapmers
    listed in Table 1, each nucleoside in the 5' wing segment and each nucleoside in the 3' wing
25  segment has a 2'-MOE modification. The internucleoside linkages throughout each gapmer are
    phosphorothioate (P=S) intemucleoside linkages. All cytosines throughout each gapmer are 5
    methylcytosines. Each gapmer in Table 1 is targeted to SEQ ID NO: 1 (GENBANK Accession
    No. NM_002111.6) or SEQ ID NO: 2 (GENBANK Accession No. NT 006081.17 truncated

    Gapmers with mixed phosphorothioateand phosphodiesterinternucleoside linkages
           The chimeric antisense oligonucleotides in Table 5 were designed as 5-10-5 MOE
    gapmers. The 5-10-5 gapmers have twenty linked nucleosides, wherein the central gap segment
 5 has ten 2'-deoxynucleotides and is flanked on both sides (in the 5' and 3' directions) by wings
   having five nucleosides each. Each nucleoside in the 5' wing segment and each nucleoside in
   the 3' wing segment has a 2'-MOE modification. The internucleoside linkages within the central
   gap segment, the linkages connecting the gap segment to the 5' or 3' wing segment, and the
   linkages for the 5'-most and 3'-most nucleosides of each wing segments are all phosphorothioate
10 (P=S) linkages; the internucleoside linkages connecting the rest of the nucleosides of both the 5'
   and 3' wing segments are phosphodiester linkages; i.e. the gapmer has a mixed backbone. All
   cytosines throughout each gapmer are 5-methylcytosines. Each gapmer in Table 5 is targeted to
   the human mRNA sequence (GENBANK Accession No. NM_002111.6, designated herein as
   SEQ ID NO: 1). 'Start site' indicates the 5'-most nucleotide to which the gapmer is targeted in

   oligonucleotide. After a treatment period of approximately 16 hours, RNA was isolated from
    cells and huntingtin mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Human primer
    probe set RTS2617 (forward sequence CTCCGTCCGGTAGACATGCT, designated herein as
.0  SEQ ID NO: 37; reverse sequence GGAAATCAGAACCCTCAAAATGG, designated herein as
    SEQ ID NO: 38; probe sequence TGAGCACTGTTCAACTGTGGATATCGGGAX, designated
    herein as SEQ ID NO: 39) was used to measure mRNA levels. Huntingtin mRNA levels were
    adjusted according to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN*. Results are presented
    in Table 9 as percent inhibition of huntingtin mRNA, relative to untreated control cells and
L5  demonstrate antisense oligonucleotide-mediated dose-dependent reduction of huntingtin mRNA
    levels.
             The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each oligonucleotide is also
    presented in Table 9 and was calculated by plotting the concentrations of oligonucleotides used
    versus the percent inhibition of huntingtin mRNA expression achieved at each concentration, and
20  noting the concentration of oligonucleotide at which 50% inhibition of huntingtin mRNA
     expression was achieved compared to the control. The ICso is expressed in M.

   Example 3: Systemic administration of antisense oligonucleotides against huntingtin
    mRNA in BACHD mice
            Of the about seventeen hundred newly designed antisense compounds, sixty six
    compounds were selected based on in vitro potency compared to ISIS 387916 for testing in
 5  systemic tolerability screens.
            BACHD mice were treated with ISIS oligonucleotides and evaluated for changes in the
    levels of various metabolic markers as well as inhibition of huntingtin mRNA in the liver.
    Antisense oligonucleotides which caused adverse changes in body weight, organ weight or in the
    levels of metabolic markers were deemed unsuitable for utilization in further studies.
20  Study 1.
    Treatment
            Nineteen groups of four BACHD mice each were injected intraperitoneally with 12.5
    mg/kg of ISIS 387916, ISIS 388241, ISIS 419629, ISIS 419637, ISIS 436684, ISIS 444578, ISIS

    2 weeks. A control group of four mice was injected intraperitoneally with PBS twice a week for
    2 weeks. Two days after the last dose, the mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and
    exsanguinated for plasma collection, after which cervical dislocation was performed and organs
   collected.
 5 RNA Analysis
            RNA was extracted from liver tissue for real-time PCR analysis of huntingtin mRNA
   levels. Human mutant huntingtin mRNA levels were measured using the human primer probe
   set RTS2617. Mouse normal huntingtin levels were measured using the mouse primer probe set
   RTS2633. Results are presented in Tables 28 and 29 and were calculated as percent inhibition
[0 of human and murine huntingtin expression levels respectively, relative to the PBS control. All
   the antisense oligonucleotides effect significant inhibition of human huntingtin mRNA levels.
   ISIS 388241 has more than three mismatches with the murine huntingtin mRNA (SEQ ID NO:
   3) and therefore did not show significant inhibition of murine mRNA levels compared to the
   control.

   Study 2
   Treatment
           Fourteen groups of four BACHD mice each were injected intraperitoneally with 12.5
5  mg/kg or 50 mg/kg of ISIS 419581, ISIS 419602, ISIS 419628, ISIS 419629, ISIS 419640, ISIS
   419641, or ISIS 419642 twice a week for 2 weeks. A group of four BACHD mice was injected
   intraperitoneally with 12.5 mg/kg of ISIS 387916 twice a week for 2 weeks. A control group of
   four mice was injected intraperitoneally with PBS twice a week for 2 weeks. Two days after the
   last dose, the mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and exsanguinated for plasma collection,
.0 after which cervical dislocation was performed and organs collected.
   RNA Analysis
           RNA was extracted from liver tissue for real-time PCR analysis of huntingtin mRNA
   levels. Human mutant huntingtin mRNA levels were measured using the human primer probe
   set RTS2617. Mouse normal huntingtin levels were measured using the mouse primer probe set
L5 RTS2633. Results are presented in Tables 32 and 33 and were calculated as percent inhibition
   of human and murine huntingtin expression levels respectively, relative to the PBS control.

      Study 4
      Treatment
             Eighteen groups of four BACHD mice each were injected intraperitoneally with 12.5
  5  mg/kg or 50 mg/kg of ISIS 388241, ISIS 437123, ISIS 437132, ISIS 437140, ISIS 437442, ISIS
     437446, ISIS 437477, ISIS 437478, or ISIS 437490 twice a week for 2 weeks. A group of four
     BACHD mice was injected intraperitoneally with 12.5 mg/kg of ISIS 387916 twice a week for 2
     weeks. A control group of four mice was injected intraperitoneally with PBS twice a week for 2
     weeks. Two days after the last dose, the mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and
 LO  exsanguinated for plasma collection, after which cervical dislocation was performed and organs
     collected.
    RNA Analysis
             RNA was extracted from liver tissue for real-time PCR analysis of huntingtin mRNA
     levels. Human mutant huntingtin mRNA levels were measured using the human primer probe
 .5  set RTS2617. Mouse normal huntingtin levels were measured using the mouse primer probe set
    RTS2633. Results are presented in Tables 40 and 41 and were calculated as percent inhibition
    of human and murine huntingtin expression levels respectively, relative to the PBS control. ISIS
    388241 and ISIS 437490 have more than three mismatches with the murine huntingtin mRNA
    (SEQ ID NO: 3) and therefore did not show significant inhibition of murine mRNA levels
20  compared to the control. ISIS 437132 has three mismatches with the murine huntingtin mRNA
    (SEQ ID NO: 3) and therefore did not show significant inhibition of murine mRNA levels
    compared to the control. ISIS 437123 and ISIS 437140 have two mismatches with the murine
    huntingtin mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 3) and do not show significant inhibition of murine mRNA
    levels compared to the control.

            Eleven groups of four BACHD mice each were injected intraperitoneally with 12.5
 5  mg/kg of ISIS 388241, ISIS 419640, ISIS 419641, ISIS 419642, ISIS 436665, ISIS 436671, ISIS
    436689, ISIS 437507, ISIS 443139, ISIS 444591, or ISIS 444661 twice a week for 2 weeks. A
    control group of four mice was injected intraperitoneally with phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
    twice a week for 2 weeks. Two days after the last dose, the mice were anaesthetized with
    isoflurane and exsanguinated for plasma collection, after which cervical dislocation was
10  performed and organs collected.
    RAA Analysis
             RNA was extracted from liver tissue for real-time PCR analysis of huntingtin mRNA
    levels. Human mutant huntingtin mRNA levels were measured using the human primer probe
     set RTS2617. Mouse normal huntingtin levels were measured using the mouse primer probe set
15   RTS2633. Results are presented in Tables 44 and 45 and were calculated as percent inhibition
     of human and murine huntingtin expression levels respectively, relative to the PBS control. All
     the antisense oligonucleotides effect significant inhibition of human huntingtin mRNA levels.
     ISIS 388241, ISIS 437507, and ISIS 443139 have more than three mismatches with the murine

     concentrations into the striatum.
 .5          A control group of 4 BACHD mice were similarly treated with PBS. ISIS 388241 was
     administered in seven groups of 4 mice each and the results presented are the average of the data
    derived from the 28 mice. ISIS 419628 was administered in 2 groups of 4 BACHD mice each
     and the results presented are the average of the data derived from the 8 mice. Seven days after
    the bolus administration, the mice were euthanized using isoflurane and the organs were
20  removed. The animals were decapitated and the brain was removed for dissection of the striatal
    tissue.
    RNA Analysis
            RNA was extracted from striatal tissue for real-time PCR analysis of huntingtin mRNA
25  levels. Human mutant huntingtin mRNA levels were measured using the human primer probe
    set RTS2617. Mouse normal huntingtin mRNA levels were measured using the murine primer
    probe set RTS2633. The results for human huntingtin mRNA levels are presented in Table 51
    and are expressed as percent inhibition compared to the PBS control group. All the antisense

    oligonucleotides effect dose-dependent inhibition of human huntingtin mRNA levels. The
    results for murine huntingtin mRNA levels are presented in Table 52 and are expressed as
    percent inhibition compared to the PBS control group.
            The effective doses (ED 5o) of each oligonucleotide for human huntingtin mRNA and
 5  mouse huntingtin mRNA were calculated by plotting the concentrations of oligonucleotides used
    versus the percent inhibition of huntingtin mRNA expression levels of either species and noting
    the concentrations at which 50% inhibition of huntingtin mRNA expression was achieved for
    each species compared to the corresponding controls. The ED 50 ( Lg) for each antisense
    oligonucleotide is also presented in Tables 51 and 52 for human and murine huntingtin mRNA

   ISIS 444584 are each mismatched by 8 base pairs or more with murine huntingtin mRNA (SEQ
   ID NO: 3) and therefore do not show significant inhibition of murine mRNA levels compared to
   the control. ISIS 437168 and ISIS 437441 have 2 mismatches each with the murine huntingtin

             Selected compounds plus the benchmark 388241 were selected based on in vitro and
     systemic potency and systemic tolerability as well as CNS potency and tolerability.
             BACHD mice were treated with ISIS oligonucleotides via intracerebroventricular (ICV)
     administration to a defined mouse brain area, the right lateral ventricle, for the purpose of
  5  evaluating the tolerability of ICV dosing in mice.
     Treatment and surgery
             Groups of five BACHD mice each were administered ISIS 388241, ISIS 437507, ISIS
     443139, ISIS 419640, ISIS 419641, ISIS 419642, ISIS 444591, ISIS 436665, ISIS 436671, ISIS
     444661, or ISIS 436689 at 150 gg/day delivered ICV with Alzet 2002 pumps at the rate of 12
 .0  pL/day for 2 weeks. A control group of 4 BACHD mice were similarly treated with PBS. The
    mice were surgically implanted with the pumps in the following manner: Mice were individually
     anaesthetized with 3%isoflurane for pump implantation. After two weeks, the mice were
     anesthetized again and the pump was surgically removed. The animals were then allowed to
    recover for two more weeks before being euthanized.
 .5         The body weights of the mice were taken weekly during the treatment and recovery
    periods. After 4 weeks, the mice were euthanized using isoflurane and decapitated. The brain
    was removed for tissue acquisition from the anterior and posterior sections.
    RNA Analysis
20          RNA was extracted from the right hemisphere of the anterior cortex and the posterior
    cerebellar section of the cannulation site for real-time PCR analysis of huntingtin mRNA levels.
    Human mutant huntingtin mRNA levels were measured using the human primer probe set
    RTS2617. Mouse normal huntingtin mRNA levels were measured using the murine primer
    probe set RTS2633. Results were calculated as percent inhibition of human and murine
25  huntingtin mRNA expression compared to the control and are presented in Tables 56 and 57
    respectively. All the antisense oligonucleotides effect significant inhibition of human huntingtin
    mRNA levels. ISIS 388241, ISIS 437507, and ISIS 443139 are each mismatched by 8 base pairs
    or more with the murine huntingtin mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 3) and therefore do not show
    significant inhibition of murine mRNA levels compared to the control. ISIS 444591 has 1
30  mismatch with the murine huntingtin mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 3) and does not show significant

 [O   tg/day delivered ICV with Alzet 2002 pumps at the rate of 0.5 pL/day for 7 days or 14 days. A
    control group of six C57/BL6 mice were similarly treated with PBS. The mice were surgically
    implanted with the pumps in the following manner: Briefly, Alzet osmotic pumps (Model 2002)
    were assembled according to manufacturer's instructions. Pumps were filled with a solution
    containing the antisense oligonucleotide and incubated overnight at 37"C, 24 hours prior to
 L5 implantation. Animals were anesthetized with 3%isofluorane and placed in a stereotactic frame.
    After sterilizing the surgical site, a midline incision was made over the skull, and a subcutaneous
    pocket was created over the back, in which a pre-filled osmotic pump was implanted. A small
    burr hole was made through the skull above the right lateral ventricle. A cannula, connected to
    the osmotic pump via a plastic catheter, was then placed in the ventricle and glued in place using
 !0 Loctite adhesive. The incision was closed with sutures. Antisense oligonucleotide or PBS was
    infused for 7 or 14 days, after which animals were euthanized according to a humane protocol
    approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Brain and spinal cord tissue
    were harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Prior to freezing, brain tissue was cut
    transversely into five sections (S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5) using a mouse brain matrix. Sections I to
25  5 were approximately 2 mm apart from each other with S1 being most rostral and S5 most
    caudal.

            Animals were allowed 10 days to recover from surgery prior to infusion being performed.
   During the post surgery recovery period, the animals were maintained on PBS ICV infusion at a
   flow rate of 0.05 mL/h using one ambulatory infusion pump per ventricle. At the end of the
   recovery period, each cannula was connected to an individual ambulatory pump (Pegasus Vario)
5  placed within a primate jacket (Lomir, PJ-02NB). The pumps remained connected until
    completion of the infusion period. After 4 weeks administration, the animals were euthanized
    and the brain, liver and kidney were harvested.
    RNA analysis of htt mRNA
            RNA was extracted from the anterior caudate, posterior caudate, temporal cortex, parietal
0   cortex, hypothalamus, mid-brain, hippocampus, and spinal cords, as well as the liver and kidney
    for real-time PCR analysis of huntingtin mRNA levels. Huntingtin mRNA levels were measured
    using the human primer probe set RTS2617 and normalized to monkey cyclophilin A levels.
    Results were calculated as percent inhibition of huntingtin mRNA expression compared to the
    PBS control and are presented in Table 61. ISIS 436689 effected significant inhibition of human
5   huntingtin mRNA levels in the CNS.

             Example 9: Measurement of half-life of ISIS 387898 in the striatum of C57/BL6
    mice via single bolus administration
             C57/BL6 mice were administered ISIS 387898 as a single bolus to the striatum for the
    purpose of measuring half-life and duration of action of the antisense oligonucleotide against
  5 huntingtin mRNA expression in that tissue.
    Treatment
             Forty C57/BL6 mice were treated with ISIS 387898 (5'
    CTCGACTAAAGCAGGATTTC 3' (SEQ ID NO: 53); start position 4042 of SEQ ID NO: 1 and
    start position 4001 of SEQ ID NO: 3) delivered as a single bolus of 50 tg in a procedure similar
 LO to that described in Example 5. Eight control C57/BL6 mice were treated with PBS in a similar
    procedure. Groups of 4 mice each were euthanized at various time points and striatal tissue
    extracted in a procedure similar to that described in Example 5.
    RNA analysis
             RNA was extracted from striatal tissue for real-time PCR analysis of huntingtin mRNA
 L5 levels. Mouse normal huntingtin mRNA levels were measured using the murine primer probe
    set RTS2633. The results are presented in Table 62 and are expressed as percent inhibition
    compared to the PBS control group at day 7. The inhibitory effect of ISIS 387898 was observed
    to be prolonged for at least 91 days.

    Analysis of antisense oligonucleotide concentrationin the brain:
                    Brain tissues were minced, weighed, homogenized, and extracted using a
    phenol/chloroform liquid-liquid extraction method. This was followed by solid phase extraction
  5 of the supernatant on a phenyl-bonded column before capillary gel eletrophoresis electrokinetic
    injection. A P/ACE MDQ capillary electrophoresis instrument (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA)
    was used for gel-filled capillary electrophoretic analysis. Oligonucleotide peaks were detected by
    UV absorbance at 260 m.
            The concentration of ISIS 387898 in the brain (tg/g) was plotted against the expression
 .0 of human huntingtin as a percentage of the PBS control (Table 63 and Figure 1). The
    concentration of ISIS 387898 which achieves 50% inhibition of huntingtin mRNA expression
    (EC5 o) was calculated. The EC50 was determined to be 0.45 pLg/g. The time-dependent
    concentration of ISIS 387898 in the brain tissue and corresponding percentage huntingtin mRNA
    expression was also plotted (Table 64 and Figure 2) and the half-life of the oligonucleotide was
 .5 calculated as 21 days.

     Example 11: Measurement of half-life of ISIS 388241 and ISIS 443139 in the lateral

  5          BACHD mice were administered ISIS 388241 or ISIS 443139 by ICV to the lateral
    ventricles of the brain for the purpose of measuring half-life and duration of action of the
    antisense oligonucleotide against huntingtin mRNA expression in that tissue.
    Treatment
            Twenty BACHD mice were treated with ISIS 38241 delivered by ICV administration at
 Lo 50 ptg/day for 2 weeks in a procedure similar to that described in Example 9. Twenty BACHD
    mice were treated with ISIS 443139 delivered by ICV administration at 50 pig/day for 2 weeks in
    a procedure similar to that described in Example 9. Twenty control BACHD mice were treated
    with PBS in a procedure similar to that described in Example 9. Groups of 4 mice each from
    both the treatment groups and control group were euthanized at biweekly time points and tissue
 .5 extracted in a procedure similar to that described in Example 9.
    RNA analysis
            RNA was extracted from the right hemisphere, both anterior and posterior to the
    cannulation site for real-time PCR analysis of huntingtin mRNA levels. Human mutant
    huntingtin mRNA levels were measured using the human primer probe set RTS2617. The
20  results are presented in Table 69 and are expressed as percent inhibition compared to the average
    of that measured in the PBS control groups. The inhibitory effects of both ISIS 388241 and ISIS
    443139 were observed to be prolonged for at least 16 weeks.
            Both ISIS 388241 and its mixed backbone equivalent, ISIS 443139, have more than 3
    mismatches with murine huntingtin mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 5) and therefore did not show
25  significant inhibition of murine mRNA levels compared to the control.

   Example 12: Effect of antisense inhibition of mutant human huntingtin on the motor
   performance of BACHD mice
           BACHD mice were treated with ISIS oligonucleotides via intracerebroventricular (ICV)
   administration for the purpose of evaluating the effect of the oligonucleotides against huntingtin
LO mRNA expression on their motor performance via the rotarod assay.
   Treatment
           The accelerating rotarod assay was performed on the Ugo Basile rotarod. Animals were
   placed on the rotarod at a speed of 2 RPM, the rotarod accelerated to 40 RPM over 5 minutes.
   The duration to fall was recorded. Duration to fall is defined by the animal either falling from
15 the rotarod, or stopping their run, hanging on to the rotarod and rotating on it. Six month old
   BACHD mice and their non-transgenic littermates were trained to run on the rotarod for one
   week prior to treatment. This consisted of three consecutive trials of 5 minutes each, with a 20
   minute rest period between trials. A group of 15 BACHD mice were then treated with ISIS
   388241 at 50 fig/day delivered ICV with Alzet 2002 pumps at the rate of 12 Ut/day for 2 weeks.
20 The mice were surgically implanted with the pumps in a similar procedure as that described in
   Example 6. A control group of 14 BACHD mice were treated with PBS in a similar manner. A
   control group of 9 non-transgenic littermates were treated with PBS in a similar manner.

   Rotarodperformance assay
            At the end of the treatment period, the pumps were removed and two weeks later, the first
   post-treatment rotarod assay was conducted. Rotarod behavior was analyzed monthly till the
   mice were I1 months of age. Each month, the animals were placed on the rotarod for three trial
 5 runs a day for 2 days. The results are presented in Fig. 7, as well as in Table 72 expressed as
   duration to fall in seconds. Baseline values at 6 months age were taken before the treatment and
   the time points given are the age of the mice at which the assay was conducted. The data
   indicates that treatment of BACHD mice with ISIS 388241 increased the duration to fall
   compared to that observed in untreated BACHD mice.

    Example 13: Effect of antisense inhibition of mutant human huntingtin and wild type
15  murine huntingtin mRNA on the motor performance of BACHD mice
            BACHD mice were treated with ISIS oligonucleotides via intracerebroventricular (ICV)
    administration for the purpose of evaluating the effect of the oligonucleotides against huntingtin
    mRNA expression on their motor performance via the rotarod assay.
    Treatment
20          The accelerating rotarod assay was performed on the Ugo Basile rotarod. Animals were
    placed on the rotarod at a speed of 2 RPM, the rotarod accelerated to 40 RPM over 5 minutes.
    The duration to fall was recorded. Duration to fall is defined by the animal either falling from
    the rotarod, or stopping their run, hanging on to the rotarod and rotating on it. Two month old
    BACHD mice and their non-transgenic littermates were trained to run on the rotarod for one
25  week prior to treatment. This consisted of three consecutive trials of 5 minutes each, with a 20
    minute rest period between trials. Groups of 17-21 BACHD mice each were then treated with

   ISIS 388241 at 50 tg/day, ISIS 408737 at 75 ptg/day, or ISIS 387898 at 75 pig/day, delivered
   ICV with Alzet 2002 pumps at the rate of 0.5 jiL/hour for 2 weeks. The mice were surgically
   implanted with the pumps in a similar procedure as that described in Example 6. A control
   group of 20 BACHD mice were treated with PBS in a similar manner. Groups of non-transgenic
 5 control mice were also similarly treated with ISIS oligonucleotides or PBS in a similar manner.
   Rotarodperformance assay
            At the end of the treatment period, the pumps were removed and two weeks later, the first
   post-treatment rotarod assay was conducted. Rotarod behavior was analyzed monthly till the
   mice were 10 months of age. Each month, the animals were placed on the rotarod for 3-5 trial
10 runs a day for 3 consecutive days. The results are presented in Table 73 expressed as duration to
   fall in seconds. Baseline values at 2 months age were taken before the treatment and the time
   points given are the age of the mice at which the assay was conducted. ISIS 387898 (designated
   in the table as Human-mouse ASO) is cross-reactive for both mouse and human huntingtin
   mRNA and therefore would inhibit both human mutant huntingtin mRNA and wild-type murine
15 huntingtin mRNA in the mice. ISIS 388241 (designated in the table as Human ASO) specifically
   targets human huntingtin mRNA and is mismatched by 8 base pairs with murine huntingtin
   mRNA. Therefore, ISIS 388241 would specifically inhibit only human mutant huntingtin
   mRNA and not wild-type murine huntingtin mRNA in the mice. ISIS 408737 (designated in the
   table as Mouse ASO) specifically targets murine huntingtin mRNA and is mismatched by 7 base
20 pairs with human huntingtin mRNA. Therefore, ISIS 408737 would specifically inhibit only
   wild-type murine huntingtin mRNA and not human mutant huntingtin mRNA in the mice. 'Tg'
   indicates the BACHD mice and 'Non-Tg' indicates the non-transgenic control mice.
            The results of the study indicate that inhibition of human mutant huntingtin mRNA by
   ISIS 388241 (Tg-Human ASO) significantly improved the performance of the mice in the
25 rotarod assay compared to the control (Tg-PBS). The results also indicate that treatment of mice
   with ISIS 387898 (Tg-Human-mouse ASO), which targets both mutant and wild-type huntingtin
   mRNA in the mice, did not cause any deleterious effects on the motor performance of the mice
    and, in fact, also significantly improved rotarod performance compared to the control (Tg-PBS).
   The mice treated with ISIS 408737 (Tg-Mouse ASO) did not show improved rotarod
30 performance compared to the PBS control, as expected, since the oligonucleotide does not target

             A group of seven five-month old YAC128 mice was administered 50 pg/day of ISIS
     388241 delivered ICV with Alzet 1004 pumps at the rate of 0.5 pl/hr for 14 days. A control
     group of four YAC128 mice were similarly treated with PBS.         A control group of eight non
  5 transgenic FVB/NJ littermates were included in the study and did not receive any treatment. The
    mice were surgically implanted with the pumps in the following manner: Briefly, Alzet osmotic
    pumps (Model 2002) were assembled according to manufacturer's instructions. Pumps were
    filled with a solution containing the antisense oligonucleotide and incubated overnight at 37*C,
    24 hours prior to implantation. Animals were anesthetized with 3%isofluorane and placed in a
 LO stereotactic frame. After sterilizing the surgical site, a midline incision was made over the skull,
    and a subcutaneous pocket was created over the back, in which a pre-filled osmotic pump was
    implanted. A small burr hole was made through the skull above the right lateral ventricle. A
    cannula, connected to the osmotic pump via a plastic catheter, was then placed in the ventricle
    and glued in place using Loctite adhesive. The incision was closed with sutures. Antisense
 .5 oligonucleotide or PBS was infused for 14 days, after which the pumps were removed. The
    animals were allowed to recover for 2 weeks after which behavioral analysis was done and the
    mice were finally euthanized according to a humane protocol approved by the Institutional
    Animal Care and Use Committee. Brain and spinal cord tissue were harvested and snap frozen
    in liquid nitrogen. Prior to freezing, brain tissue was cut transversely into five sections (S1, S2,
 .0 S3, S4, and S5) using a mouse brain matrix. Sections 1 to 5 were approximately 2 mm apart
    from each other with Sl being most rostral and S5 most caudal.
    Open field assay
             Mice were placed in an open field arena (Med Associates) that uses photobeam breaks to
    measure horizontal and vertical movement over a 30 min test session. Data was analyzed using
25  Activity Monitor software to examine total ambulatory movement within the arena and
    movement within the center of the arena as a measure of anxiety. YAC 128 control mice were
    expected to spend less time at the centre of the arena compared to their non-transgenic, less
    anxiety-prone FVB/NJ litteriates. The results are presented in Fig. 9 and Table 75 and indicate
    that treatment of YAC128 mice with antisense oligonucleotide decreased anxiety in these mice,
30  according to the parameters of the open field assay.

   being the most rostral and S5 the most caudal.
   RNA analysis
 5         Total RNA was extracted from anterior and posterior cortices of the brain for real-time
   PCR analysis of huntingtin mRNA levels using an RNeasy Mini prep kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR
   reactions were conducted on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems).
   Mouse huntingtin mRNA levels were measured using a murine primer probe set RTS2633 and
   normalized to cyclophilin mRNA levels. The results are presented in Table 78 as percent
10 reduction compared to the PBS control. ISIS 387916, ISIS 437527, ISIS 444627, and ISIS
   444652 all have one mismatch with the murine huntingtin mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 3) and therefore
   did not show significant inhibition of murine mRNA levels compared to the control.
           The microglial marker, AIFI was also measured by RT-PCR analysis using murine
   primer probe set mAIFiLTS00328 (forward sequence TGGTCCCCCAGCCAAGA, designated
15 herein as SEQ ID NO: 54; reverse sequence CCCACCGTGTGACATCCA, designated herein as
    SEQ ID NO: 55; probe sequence AGCTATCTCCGAGCTGCCCTGATTGG, designated herein

   oligonucleotides did not induce an inflammatory response.

    Example 17: Assay for neurotoxic effects of bolus administration of antisense
    oligonucleotides in the striatal tissue of rats.
             Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with ISIS oligonucleotides via bolus administration to
    the striatum, for the purpose of screening for the induction of the microglial marker AIF 1 as a
  5 measure of CNS toxicity.
    Treatment and surgery
             Groups of four Sprague-Dawley rats were administered ISIS 388241, ISIS 443139, ISIS
    436671, ISIS 437527, ISIS 444584, ISIS 444591, or ISIS 444652 delivered as a single bolus at a
    concentration of 25 ptg, 50 pg, 75 pig, or 100 ig.
 LO          A group of 4 rats were similarly treated with ISIS 387916, delivered as a single bolus at
    10 ptg, 25 pig, 50 jig, or 75 pg concentrations. A control group of 4 rats were similarly treated
    with PBS. Seven days after bolus administration, the rats were euthanized using isoflurane and
    the organs were removed. The animals were decapitated and the brain was removed for
    dissection of the striatal tissue. A pair of fine curved forceps was placed straight down into the
 t5 brain just anterior to the hippocampus to make a transverse incision in the cortex and underlying
    tissues by blunt dissection. The tips of another pair of fine curved forceps were placed straight
    down along the midsaggital sinus midway between the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb to
    make a longitudinal incision, cutting the corpus callosum by blunt dissection. The first pair of
    forceps was then used to reflect back the resultant corner of cortex exposing the striatum and
20  internal capsule, and then to dissect the internal capsule away from the striatum. The second set
    of forceps was placed such that the curved ends were on either side of the striatum and pressed
    down to isolate the tissue. The first set of forceps was used to pinch off the posterior end of the
    striatum and to remove the striatum from the brain.
    RNA Analysis of AIF1 expression levels
25           RNA was extracted from striatal tissue for real-time PCR analysis of AIF I mRNA levels.
    Rat AIF 1 levels were measured using the rat primer probe set rAifl_LTS00219. Results were
    calculated as the percentage of AIF1 expression over that of the PBS control and are presented in

  RNA Analysis of huntingtin expression levels
          RNA was extracted from striatal tissue for real-time PCR analysis of huntingtin mRNA
  levels. Rat huntingtin mRNA levels were measured using the rat primer probe set
  rHttLTS00343. Results were calculated as the percentage reduction of huntingtin expression
5 over that of the PBS control and are presented in Table 82. ISIS 388241 and ISIS 443139 are
  each mismatched by 6 base pairs or more with the rat gene sequence (SEQ ID NO: 5) and
  therefore do not show significant inhibition of rat mRNA levels compared to the control. ISIS
  444584 has 3 mismatches with the rat gene sequence (SEQ ID NO: 5) and therefore does not
  show significant inhibition of rat mRNA levels compared to the control.

   Example 18: Dose-dependent antisense inhibition of huntingtin mRNA in cynomoigous
   primary hepatocytes
 5         ISIS 437527, ISIS 444584, and ISIS 444652 were tested in cynomolgous primary
   hepatocytes at various doses. The benchmark oligonucleotides, ISIS 387916 and ISIS 388241
   were also included for comparison. Cells were plated at a density of 35,000 cells per well and
   transfected using electroporation with 39.0625 nM, 78.125 nM, 156.25 nM, 312.5 nM, 625 nM,
    1,250 nM, 2,500 nM, 5,000 nM, 10,000 nM, and 20,000 nM concentrations of each antisense
10 oligonucleotide. After approximately 16 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and huntingtin
   mRNA transcript levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR using primer probe set
   RTS2686. Huntingtin mRNA transcript levels were normalized to total RNA content, as
   measured by RIBOGREEN*. Results are presented in Table 83 as percent inhibition of
   huntingtin, relative to untreated control cells. Control oligonucleotide, ISIS 141923 was
15 included in this assay and did not demonstrate inhibition of huntingtin mRNA, as expected.
           ISIS 437527, ISIS 444584, and ISIS 444652 had lower IC50 values than the benchmark
   oligonucleotide, ISIS 388241. ISIS 437527 and ISIS 444652 had as low or lower IC50 values
   than the benchmark oligonucleotide, ISIS 387916.

   Example 19: Measurement of half-life of ISIS oligonucleotides in BACHD mice via single
   intrastriatal bolus administration
           BACHD mice were administered ISIS oligonucleotides as a single bolus to the striatum
 5 for the purpose of measuring the duration of action of the antisense oligonucleotides against
   huntingtin mRNA expression, or its half-life, in that tissue.
   Treatment andsurgery
           Groups of 25 BACD mice each were treated with ISIS 388241, ISIS 436689, ISIS
   436671, or ISIS 444591, delivered as a single bolus of 40 ptg in a procedure similar to that
10 described in Example 4. A control group of 25 BACHD mice were treated with PBS in a similar
   procedure. At various time points, 5 mice from each group were euthanized and striatal tissue
   was extracted. A pair of fine curved forceps was placed straight down into the brain just anterior
   to the hippocampus to make a transverse incision in the cortex and underlying tissues by blunt
   dissection. The tips of another pair of fine curved forceps were placed straight down along the
15 midsaggital sinus midway between the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb to make a
   longitudinal incision, cutting the corpus callosum by blunt dissection. The first pair of forceps
   was then used to reflect back the resultant corner of cortex exposing the striatum and internal
   capsule, and then to dissect the internal capsule away from the striatum. The second set of
   forceps was placed such that the curved ends were on either side of the striatum and pressed
20 down to isolate the tissue. The first set of forceps was used to pinch off the posterior end of the
   striatum and to remove the striatum from the brain.

          RNA was extracted from anterior and posterior sections of the striatal tissue for real-time
   PCR analysis of huntingtin mRNA levels. Human mutant huntingtin mRNA levels were
   measured using RTS2617. Mouse normal huntingtin mRNA levels were measured using the
   murine primer probe set RTS2633. The results are presented in Tables 84 and 85 and are
 5 expressed as percent inhibition compared to the average of the PBS control group at week 1,
   week 10, and week 20. The half-life of the ISIS oligonucleotides in the anterior section of the
   brain was calculated from the inhibition data and is presented in Table 86.

    Example 20: Effect of intrathecal administration of ISIS 437527 in Sprague Dawley rats
            Sprague Dawley rats were dosed with ISIS 437527 by intrathecal (IT) administration
  5 either as a single dose, repeated doses, or continuous infusion.
     Treatment and surgery
            Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and a 28-gauge polyurethane catheter was placed
    into the IT lumbar space of each rat. The proximal end of the catheter was attached to a dosing
    pedestal that was extended through the skin for animals in groups receiving bolus injections. The
 [0 catheter for animals in the group receiving continuous infusion was attached to an ALZET pump
    (Model 2MLI) which was placed in a subcutaneous pocket on the dorsal aspect of each animal.
    Post-surgically the animals received a single intramuscular dose of ceftiofur sodium (5 mg/kg)
    and butorphanol tartrate (0.05 mg/kg). The rats receiving continuous infusion began receiving
    the oligonucleotide dose immediately. The animals that would receive bolus injections were
 .5 allowed a surgical recovery period of at least five days after which the patency of the catheter
    was evaluated.
            A group of 5 Sprague Dawley rats was administered a single bolus injection of 350 pLg of
    ISIS 437527 delivered intrathecally. Another group of 5 Sprague Dawley rats was administered
    bolus injections of 120 ptg of ISIS 437527 delivered intrathecally three times over the course of 1
20  week. Another group of 5 Sprague Dawley rats was administered bolus injections of 350 jig of
    ISIS 437527 delivered intrathecally three times over the course of 1 week. Another group of 5
    Sprague Dawley rats was administered 50 jig/day of ISIS 437527 delivered by continuous
    infusion at a rate of 0.0lmL/hr for 7 days. A control group of 5 Sprague Dawley rats was
    administered bolus injections of PBS delivered intrathecally three times over the course of 1
25  week. Each group was given a recovery period of 7 days, after which the rats were euthanized.
    The brain and spinal cord from all groups were harvested and analyzed.

 5 Example 21: Measurement of half-life of ISIS 436689 in the CNS tissues of cynomolgous

           Cynomolgous monkeys were administered ISIS 436689 intrathecally (IT) for the purpose
   of measuring the half-life and duration of action of the antisense oligonucleotide against
   huntingtin mRNA expression in various CNS tissues.
10 Treatment
           The study was conducted at Northern Biomedical Research, MI. Prior to the start of the
   treatment, the monkeys were kept in quarantine for a 4-week time period, during which standard
   panels of serum chemistry and hematology, examination of fecal samples for ova and parasites,
   and a tuberculosis test, were conducted to screen out abnormal or ailing monkeys. The monkeys
15 were implanted with intrathecal lumbar catheters using polyurethane catheters connected to a
   subcutaneous titanium access port (P.A.S. PORT@ Elite Plastic/Titanium portal with Ultra lock

   connector). For continuous infusion using an external pump, the animals were anesthetized to
   attach the dosing apparatus to the port. The animals were pretreated with atropine sulfate by
   subcutaneous injection at a dose of 0.04 mg/kg. Approximately 15 minutes later, an
   intramuscular dose of 8 mg/kg of ketamine HCl was administered to induce sedation. The
 5 animals were masked to a surgical plane of anesthesia, intubated and maintained on
   approximately 1 L/min of oxygen and 2% halothane or isoflurane. The animals received a single
   intramuscular dose of 5 mg/kg ceftiofur sodium antibiotic. An incision was made near the port
   for placement of the modified needle support. The modified needle was placed in the port and
   secured with sutures. Upon recovery from surgery, a jacket was placed on the animal.
10         Fifteen male cynomolgus monkeys were administered 4 mg/day of ISIS 436689 at a
   concentration of 1.67 mg/mL and at a flow rate of 2.4 mL/day for 21 days. A control group of 3
   cynomolgus monkeys was administered with PBS in a similar manner for the same time period.
   Groups of 3 monkeys each were allowed recovery periods of 1 day, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, or 8
   weeks, after which they were euthanized. During the study period, the monkeys were observed
15 daily for signs of illness or distress.
           All animals were sedated with an intramuscular injection of 8.0 mg/kg of ketamine HClI,
   maintained on a halothane or isoflurane/oxygen mixture, and provided with an intravenous bolus
   of heparin Na at 200 IU/kg. The animals were perfused via the left cardiac ventricle with
   0.001% sodium nitrite in saline.
20         At the time of sacrifice, the brain was cut in a brain matrix at 3 mm coronal slice
   thickness. Several brain structures were sampled using a 4 mm biopsy punch. One 4 mm
   diameter sample from each structure was placed in 2 mL screw capped tubes containing 1.0 mL
   of RNAlater RNA stabilization solution (Qiagen, CA), incubated for 1 hour at ambient
   temperature and then frozen. Adjacent 6 mm diameter samples were placed in 2 mL screw
25 capped tubes and frozen for pharmacokinetic analysis.
           The spinal cord was sectioned into cervical, thoracic and lumbar sections, and
   approximately 3 mm thick sections of each area of the spinal cord were taken for RNA and

    Oligonucleotide concentrationmeasurement by ELISA
            Tissues (20 mg) were minced, weighed, and homogenized prior to liquid/liquid extraction
    using phenol/chloroform. The supernatant was removed, lyophilized, and reconstituted in human
    EDTA plasma (1 mL) before being analyzed using a hybridization ELISA procedure.
  5         ISIS 436689 was detected in the tissues by hybridization to a labeled complementary
    cutting probe (digoxigenin at the 5'end and a C18 spacer and BioTEG at the 3'end). The
    complex was then captured on a neutravidin-coated plate and SI nuclease was added to digest
    the unhybridized cutting probes. Since ISIS 436689 protected the cutting probe from digestion,
    the undigested cutting probe was used as a measure of the oligonucleotide concentration. The
 [O undigested cutting probe was detected using an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline
    phosphatase followed by fluorogenic substrate readout. Oligonucleotide concentrations were
    measured in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar sections of the spinal cord and in the liver on days
    7, 20, 34, and 62 of the recovery period, and are presented in Table 92. The half-life of ISIS
    436689 in these tissues was calculated from this data, and is presented in Table 93. The data
 [5 indicates that the oligonucleotide was mainly concentrated in the CNS with negligible
    concentrations in the systemic tissues.
