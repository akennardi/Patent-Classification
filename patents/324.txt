Title of Invention:       CARD SHOOTER DEVICE AND CARD STORAGE
METHOD
Technical Field
 [0001]
         The present invention relates to a card shooter
device used for a playing game, and to a card shooter
device capable of storing playing cards              (hereinafter
referred     to as  "cards"),  particularly    cards    constituting
a predetermined number of decks at one time without
lifting the cards       and a card packing box containing the
cards, and a card storage method.
Background Art
 [0002]
         In various types   of playing games such as poker,
baccarat, bridge, and blackjack, a dealer stores one or
more decks of cards in a card shooter device, extracts
the cards one by one therefrom, and deals the cards to
game players.       Generally,    a widely practiced      way of
storing cards in the card shooter device is that the
dealer opens      a top face cover on the top of the card
shooter device, collectively lifts the one or more decks
of cards by hand at one time, and stores the cards                   (see,
e.g.,     Patent Literature 1).

                              -2
[0003]
      The cards used in various types    of playing games
such as poker, baccarat, bridge, and blackjack are      stored
in a card shooter device for use in a unit of six to ten
decks of cards.    Eight decks of cards   include 416 cards,
and the bulk thereof is approximately 125 millimeters.
Already-shuffled cards    constituting a predetermined
number of decks are extracted from a packing box or are
exposed by opening a part of the packing box, in which
state a cut card is inserted among the cards, and
thereafter stored in the card shooter device.       To fairly
play the playing game,    a dealer must keep a state where
only respective back surfaces of the cards      can be seen
for game players until the packing box is opened to store
the cards in the card shooter device.      When the cards are
being stored in the card shooter device, the cards must
also be collectively lifted by hand without breaking the
deck after a top face cover in the card shooter device is
opened.    In the meantime, a card storage section in the
card shooter device has a distance between its side
surface portions that    is substantially the same as the
size of respective side surfaces of the cards      so that the
cards are not scattered therein and the order of the
cards   is not changed.   When the card shooter device
stores eight decks of cards,     there are only several
centimeters left in its depth.      Thus, when the dealer
attempts to lift and store cards     constituting a

                             - 3
predetermined number of decks at one time,     the dealer
cannot handle    the cards well to  insert them.  For example,
a mistake of erroneously scattering the eight decks of
cards   is likely to occur because the first one of the
cards   is caught by the card shooter device to break the
deck.    The cards, which have been scattered on a game
table, cannot be used for a game, which constitutes a
factor preventing the game from being efficiently
operated.

Description of Embodiments
[0011]
     Details of the present invention will be described
below.  However, the following detailed description and
attached drawings are not    limited to the invention.
[0012]
     An embodiment 1 of the present invention will be
described.   Figures  1(a),  1(b), and 1(c) are respectively
perspective views of a card shooter device 1 according to
the embodiment 1, and respectively illustrate different
states.  In the card shooter device 1, a main unit 7
including a card storage section 3 storing cards 2s
constituting a predetermined number of decks and a
removable top face cover 4 for covering the card storage
section 3 on top of the card storage section 3 are
arranged.   In the card storage section 3, a bottom face 5
for supporting the cards 2s stored in the card storage
section 3 and guiding a card 2 onto a game table 6 from
the front is   formed in the main unit 7.   Further, a front
cover 8 is arranged in front of the main unit 7 in the

                            - 10
card shooter device   1 so that the cards are extracted one
by one from the card storage section 3.    The front cover
8 is removably mounted on the card shooter device    1 in
cooperation with an engagement member 9 provided in front
of the card shooter device 1, to restrict movement in a
direction indicated by a forward arrow F of the cards 2s
constituting the predetermined number of decks stored in
the card storage section 3 when the   front cover 8 is
mounted while being adapted to have an opening 10 through
which the cards 2 can pass one by one formed between the
front cover 8 and the bottom face 5.    When the front
cover 8 is removed, the cards 2s constituting the
predetermined number of decks can be stored in the card
storage section 3.   When a magnet is provided on the top
of the front cover 8, mounting of the top face cover 4 on
the main unit 7 can be stabilized.    Further, as described
in Figure 1(d),  there are protrusions 11 at an end on the
back of the top  face cover 4, and the protrusions   11 can
be respectively caught by locking members 2 in the card
shooter device  1 to serve as a bridge so that a slope
continuing to the bottom face 5 from the top face cover 4
can be formed.
[0013]
     A method using the packing box 13 storing the cards
2s constituting the predetermined number of decks to
store the cards 2 in the packing box 13 in the card
shooter device  1 for dealing the cards 2 on the game

                            -   11
table 6 will be described with reference to Figure 2.
The above-described packing box 13 has a rectangular
parallelepiped shape,   includes a cut line 13c parallel to
a longitudinal direction of a rectangular parallelepiped,
and is adapted to be able to expose respective side
surfaces of the cards 2s within the packing box 13 when
the packing box 13 is divided along the cut line 13c to
remove a left or right side surface of the packing box 13,
and the card shooter device 1 includes the main unit
including the card storage section 3 storing the cards 2s
constituting the predetermined number of decks, the
bottom face 5, inclined forward, for guiding the cards 2
onto the game table 6 from the card storage section 3,
and the front cover 8 provided in front of the main unit
7 and removably mounted on the main unit 7 in corporation
with the engagement member 9.
[0014]
     This method includes     (1) a step of removing a top
face cover 4 arranged on top of the card storage section
3 in the card shooter device 1      (a top face cover removal
step),  (2) a step of removing the front cover 8 from the
main unit 7 in the card shooter device 1       (a front cover
removal step),   (3) a step of preparing the packing box 13
storing the cards   2s constituting the predetermined
number of decks, dividing the packing box 13 along the
cut line 13c in the packing box 13 and removing the left
or right side surface of the packing box 13 to expose the

                               - 12
respective side surfaces of the cards            2s in the packing
box 13   (a card side surface exposure          step:    indicated by 2
in Figure 2),     (4) a step of inserting a cut card 14 among
the cards 2a in the packing box 13 with the side surfaces
exposed   (a cut card insertion step:          indicated by 3 in
Figure 2),    (5) a step of storing the cards            2s after the
cards 2s,   together with a part of the packing box 13,                are
slid into the card storage section 3 while being guided
by the bottom face 5 from the front of the main unit 7
from which the front cover 8 is removed             (a card 2s
storage step:    indicated by 4 in Figure 2),            and   (6) a step
of removing the packing box 13        from the card storage
section 3 and leaving only the cards 2s in the card
storage section 3      (a storage completion step:           indicated
by 6 in Figure 2),      and the cards    2s are stored in the
card storage section 3.
 [0015]
      The number of cut lines in the packing box 13                is not
limited to one.      For example,   a packing box 13 including
two cut lines    can also be used.      First,     after    either   one
of left and right side surfaces of the packing box 13
including the two cut lines is removed, the cut card 14
is  inserted thereinto     (step (4)).      Then, after the other
side surface is removed, the cards 2s may be stored in
the card storage section 3 with the cards 2s retained in
a left central band-shaped portion, i.e.,              with both the
side surfaces of the card 2s exposed.

                           -  13
[0016]
     As described in Figure 1(d),    an extension member 21
forming a structure serving as a bridge with an upper
surface of the game table 6 can be arranged at a leading
end of the  front of the card shooter device 1.     The cards
2s, together with a part of the packing box 13,      can be
slid from an upper surface of the extension member 21       and
stored in the card storage section 3.      This figure
illustrates an example in which the     structure serving as
the bridge with the upper surface of the game table 6 is
formed at the leading end of the front of the card
shooter device  1 using the top   face cover 4 as the
extension member 21   (indicated by reference numerals 1
and 4 in Figure 2).
[0017]
     Thus, according to the embodiment of the present
invention, the top face cover 4 arranged on top of the
card storage section 3 in the card shooter device      1 is
first removed, and the card 2 is    removed if left in the
card storage section 3.   Further, after the cards     2s are
stored in the card storage section 3,     the front cover 8,
which has been removed from the main unit, is mounted on
the card shooter device 1    (indicated by 5 in Figure 2),
and the storage completion step    (6) is then performed.
[0018]
     A detailed structure of the engagement member 9 for
removably mounting the front cover 8 on the card shooter

                                 -   14
device 1 will be described below with reference to
Figures   3 to 7 (b) . As  illustrated       in  Figure  4, two L
shaped hooks 15 are provided in the engagement member 9
fixed to the card shooter device 1 with bolts B.              Two L
shaped hook receiving sections 16 in an opposite
direction to the two L-shaped hooks 15 are provided on
the back, mounted on the engagement member 9, of the
front cover 8.     When the front cover 8 is slid along an
obliquely downward arrow X from above the engagement
member 9 while respective marks A in both the members
match each other, as illustrated in Figure 5, the two
hooks 15 in the engagement member 9 and the two hook
receiving sections 16     in the front cover 8 mesh with each
other.
[0019]
      The engagement member 9 is provided with a groove 18
inside which a locking protrusion 17            is mounted, as
illustrated in Figure 4, and a button 20 having a bar
shaped button extension section 19 on its bottom is
further mounted, as illustrated in Figures 5 to 7, on the
back, mounted on the engagement member 9, of the front
cover   8 (a locking device).          When the  front  cover 8 is
slid while overlapping the engagement member 9 along the
obliquely downward arrow X from above the engagement
member 9, the button extension section 19 on the bottom
of the button 20 mounted on the front cover 8 enters the
groove 18 in the engagement member 9, and advances after

                              -  15
passing through a gap between the groove 18 and the
locking protrusion 17     in the groove 18.         However, after
passing through the gap, the button extension section 19
is designed not to be returned by being caught by the
locking protrusion 17     if the button extension section 19
attempts to be returned in an opposite direction             (a lock
 (L)  state) .  When the button 20     on the top of the button
extension section 19     is pushed along an arrow Y inward
from outside while being slid in an opposite direction to
the arrow X,    the button extension section 19 can be
returned to its original state after moving inward
simultaneously with the button 20          and passing through the
gap between the groove 18 and the locking protrusion 17
in   the groove  18  (an unlock   (UL)   state).     The button 20
and the button extension section 19 are connected to the
front cover with a member having a structure of an
elastic spring s interposed therebetween.             The button
extension section 19 returns to its original state when
the button 20    is released after being pushed with a
finger inward from outside.        Therefore, the front cover 8
is designed to be required to be removed by being slid in
an obliquely upward direction        (in an opposite direction
to the arrow X)     while the button 20        is pressed.  Thus,  a
hook-shaped member, a magnet, and the elastic spring s
can also be used to make the front cover 8 and the card
shooter device    1 removable   from each other in addition to

                             -   16
a meshing structure and a locking structure formed
between the front cover 8 and the engagement member 9.
[0020]
       The card shooter device 1 is preferably adapted so
that a length 1 from a position 51 at a leading end on
the lower side of the front cover 8 to a leading end 52
of the main unit on the bottom face 5 is not less than
half the length in a longitudinal direction of the
packing box 13 storing the cards        2s when the front cover
8 is   mounted  (see Figure 8) .    When the card  shooter
device 1 is thus adapted, the cards 2s in the packing box
13 respective side surfaces of which remain exposed can
be stably placed on the bottom face 5 from the position
51   at the leading end on the lower side of the front
cover 8 to the leading end 52 of the main unit when the
front cover 8 is mounted, i.e.,        the cards 2s can be
prevented from being inclined in a direction of the game
table 6.    Therefore, workability in arranging the order
of the cards    2s is improved.
[0021]
       The bottom face 5 may be formed to continue to the
upper surface of the game table 6 by adapting the card
shooter device    1 so that an inclined extension body 23
having its leading end contacting the game table 6 is
separately installed at the leading end 52        of the main
unit and the leading end of the inclined extension body
23 contacts the game table 6        (see Figures 9(a) and 9(b)).

                             -  17
When the card shooter device 1 is thus configured, the
cards 2s in the packing box 13 the side surfaces of which
remain exposed can be slid into the card storage section
3 from the  front of the main unit 7 after the order of
the cards 2s is arranged once after being placed to
extend over the game table 6 and the leading end 52 of
the main unit.    A case where the bottom face 5 continues
to the upper surface of the game table 6 also      includes a
case where there is a step between the leading end of the
inclined extension body 23 and the game table 6 in a
range in which the cards 2s are slid into the card
storage section 3 between the bottom face 5 and the game
table 6 without any difficulty.      The leading end 52 of
the main unit may contact the game table 6 instead of the
inclined extension body 23 being used.      When the card
shooter device   1 is thus configured, restrictions on a
location where the cards 2s are placed are loosened.
Therefore, workability in arranging the order of the
cards 2s is  improved.

     Figure 10 illustrates     a card 2 constituting the card
2s.  On the card 2 used for a table game such as baccarat,
a numeric character is    coded, and is printed as codes C
with UV  (ultraviolet) ink or the like which is generally
invisible.   The codes C are respectively point
symmetrically provided on the upper side and the lower
side of the card 2.    The code C is printed with paint

                             -   18
which is visualized by receiving ultraviolet light, and
is desirably printed at a position not overlapping a type
notation and an index of a card.
 [0023]
      Details of a reading device 22,       which reads the
codes C representing a numeric character          (a place, a
number, a rank) on the card 2 when the card 2 is manually
extracted from the card storage section 3 will be
described below with reference to Figure 11.           The reading
device 22   is provided on the bottom face 5 for guiding
the cards 2 manually extracted one by one from the
opening 10   in front of the card storage section 3 on the
game table 6.    When the locking member 12 also used as a
reading device cover 25 for covering a sensor group in
the reading device 22    is removed, the sensor group in the
reading device 22    is exposed     (the reading device cover 25
is  removable with a screw) .     The   sensor group   includes  an
ultraviolet reaction    sensor    (UV sensor) 120 and two
object detection sensors    122 and 123,      for example.
 [0024]
      In the reading device 22,      a control section     (not
illustrated) controls the      start and the end of reading of
the UV sensor 120 based on respective detection signals
of the object detection sensors        122 and 123.    The control
section   (not illustrated) determines whether the card 2
has normally passed over the bottom face 5 based on the
detection signals    of the object detection sensors        122 and

                              - 19
123.   As  illustrated in Figure 10,    square codes C each
representing a rank     (number) and a suit   (heart, spade,
etc.)  of the card are arranged in two rows and four
columns at edges of the card 2.       The UV sensor 120
outputs an on signal when it detects the code C.        The
reading device 22 determines a relative relationship
between both signals     input from the UV sensor 120.    Thus,
the reading device 22     specifies the code depending on a
relative difference between the two codes C detected by
the UV sensor 120,    for example, and specifies a number     (a
rank) and a type    (suit) of the corresponding card 2.
[0025]
      Thus, the control device     (not illustrated)
determines victory or defect of a game based on the
number    (rank) of the card 2 read from the card 2.
[0026]
      While the reading device cover 25 functions to
protect the sensor group in the reading device 22       from
damage, the reading device cover 25 may be adapted to
function as the    locking member 12.

Industrial Applicability
[00301
     A card shooter device according to the present
invention and a method for storing cards in a card storage
section in the card shooter device are useful for a playing
game in a casino or the like because they make it easy to
store the cards in the card storage section in the card
shooter device prior to the playing game and can prevent a
mistake of erroneously scattering the cards to break a deck.
