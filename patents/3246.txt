62/433,326, filed December 13, 2016, entitled "Dipole-Type Source for Generating Very Low
Frequency Pressure Wavefields," the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
reference.
                                         BACKGROUND
        [0002] Techniques for marine surveying include marine seismic surveying, in which
geophysical data may be collected from below the Earth's surface. Marine seismic surveying
has applications in mineral and energy exploration and production to help identify locations of
hydrocarbon-bearing formations.       Marine seismic surveying typically may include towing a
seismic source below or near the surface of a body of water. One or more "streamers" may also
be towed through the water by the same or a different vessel. The streamers are typically cables
that include a plurality of sensors disposed thereon at spaced apart locations along the length of
each cable. Some seismic surveys locate sensors on ocean bottom cables or nodes in addition to,
or instead of, streamers. The sensors may be configured to generate a signal that is related to a
parameter being measured by the sensor. At selected times, the seismic source may be actuated,
for example, to generate a pressure wave field. The sensors may measure the pressure wave field
at a particular point, including pressure waves in the pressure wave field affected by interaction
with subsurface formations. The measurements of the pressure wave field may be used to infer
certain properties of the subsurface formations, such as structure, mineral composition, and fluid
content, thereby providing information useful in the recovery of hydrocarbons.
        [0003] It is well known that as pressure waves travel through water and through
subsurface formations, higher frequency pressure waves may be attenuated more rapidly than
lower frequency pressure waves, and consequently, lower frequency pressure waves can be
transmitted over longer distances through water and geological structures than higher frequency
pressure waves. In addition, the lowest frequency range can be important for deriving the elastic
properties of the subsurface by seismic full wave field inversion (FWI). Accordingly, there has
been a need for powerful low frequency marine sound sources operating in the frequency band of
1-100 hertz ("Hz") and, as low as 2 to 3 octaves below 6 Hz. However, generation of low
                                               - la-

frequency pressure wave fields from seismic sources based on volume injection, such as air guns,
marine vibrators, benders, etc., hereinafter referred to as "monopole-type sources," may be
limited by a ghost function of the monopole-type source, in which the pressure wave fields that
propagate toward the water surface are reflected at the water-air interface. These reflected waves,
commonly referred to as "ghosts," have the opposite polarity of the up-going waves and
propagate toward the water bottom. The ghosts interfere with the pressure waves from the sound
source going downwards toward the bottom and act as a filter on the reflected wave field. The
amplitude spectrum of a monopole-type ghost filter G(w) = 1 - eL-'           (with r vertical delay
time) is sine shaped with amplitude zero at k*watervelocity/(2*source_depth) Hz (and maxima
in the middle between two zero crossings) for k=0, 1, 2, etc. Thus, the amplitude of the
monopole-type source may approach zero at 0 Hz.
                        BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
        [0004] These drawings illustrate certain aspects of some of the embodiments of the

         [0014] FIG. 12 illustrates an example embodiment of a marine seismic survey system.
                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
         [0015] Embodiments may be directed to dipole-type sources and associated methods and
systems. At least one embodiment may be directed to a dipole-type source used for marine
seismic survey systems, wherein the dipole-type source may generate an up-going wave and a
down-going wave with opposite polarity. This type of source that generates an up-going wave
and a down-going wave with opposite polarity may be referred to as a "dipole-type source." It
should be understood that the up-going wave is not required to travel upwards in a direction
normal to the water surface, but instead emanates from the dipole-type source and travels
generally upward toward the water surface, while the down-going wave emanates from the
dipole-type source and travels generally downward towards the water bottom.
         [0016] FIGS. 1A to IC illustrate an example embodiment of a dipole-type source 100. As
illustrated, dipole-type source 100 may include two sound radiating surfaces, in the form of first
bender plate 102 and second bender plate 104, to generate pressure waves. In the illustrated
embodiment, first and second bender plates 102, 104 may bend and flex to generate pressure
waves. First bender plate 102 and second bender plate 104 may each act in a phase opposite to
the other such that first and second bender plates 102, 104 oscillate substantially synchronously
in the same direction such that dipole-type source 100 may generate an up-going wave and a
down-going wave with opposite polarity. As used herein, the two sound radiating surfaces (e.g.,
first bender plate 102 and second bender plate 104) are considered to oscillate substantially
synchronously where at least 95% of their oscillation is in the same direction. For example, at
least 95%, 98%,     99 %, or 99.9% of the oscillation of the sound radiating surfaces (e.g., first
bender plate 102 and second bender plate 104) may be in the same direction. Dipole-type source
100 may act by change of momentum and the amplitude spectra of a dipole-type ghost filter
G(&)) = 1 + e-w       (with r vertical delay time) is cosine shaped with amplitude zero at
(k+1/2)*water velocity/(2*source_depth) Hz (and maxima in the middle between two zero
crossings) for k=0, 1, 2, etc. Thus, the amplitude of the ghost function approaches its first
maximum when the frequencies approach 0 Hz. Thus, dipole-type source 100 may be suited for
generating very low frequencies, for example, from about 0.75 Hz to about 6 Hz, and
specifically, from about 3 Hz to about 6 Hz, about 1.5 Hz to 3 Hz, or about .75 Hz to 1.5 Hz.
                                                -3-

Further, while combining first and second bender plates 102, 104, which ordinarily function
separately as a monopole-type source, with a dipole-type source, a pressure wave field with
decomposed upward and downward propagation can be generated, which are free of spectral
notches. In other words, source side wave field separation can be achieved. While FIGS. 1A to
1C illustrate dipole-type source 100 in the forn of a "bender" (also commonly referred to as a
"flexural-disc projector"), the disclosure is not limited to dipole-type source 100 being a bender.
In alternative embodiments, dipole-type source 100 may be in the form or an acoustic vibratory
source, a piston plate type source, or other suitable device for generating the desired pressure
waves.
         [0017] In the illustrated embodiment, dipole-type source 100 includes first and second
bender plates 102, 104. While not illustrated, springs and mass elements may be attached to first
and second bender plates 102, 104 as desired for a particular application. In some embodiments,
first and second bender plates 102, 104 may be generally planar. In particular embodiments, first
and second bender plates 102, 104 may each be in the form of a flexible disk. In embodiments,
the first and second bender plates 102, 104 may each be flat, circular disks having substantially
uniform thickness. However, other configurations of first and second bender plates 102, 104,
including both axially-symmetric and axially-asymmetric, may be suitable for particular
applications. By way of example, first and second bender plates 102, 104 may be rectangular,
square, elliptical, or other suitable shape for providing the desired pressure waves. First and
second bender plates 102, 104 may be made from any of a variety of materials including
materials comprising steel, aluminum, a copper alloy, glass-fiber reinforced plastic (e.g., glass
fiber reinforced epoxy), carbon fiber reinforced or other suitable flexible spring material.
Examples of suitable copper alloys may include brass, beryllium, copper, phosphor bronze, or
other suitable copper alloy. In some embodiments, first and second bender plates 102, 104 may
comprise aluminum. First and second bender plates 102, 104 may be made from the same or a
different material. In particular embodiments, first and second bender plates 102, 104 may have a
thickness from about 1 millimeter to about 12 millimeters or even greater. However, dimensions
outside these ranges may be suitable for a particular application, as desired by one of ordinary
skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure. In general, first and second bender plates 102,
104 should have a thickness that allows sufficient deformation but can withstand expected
differential static pressures.
                                                  -4-

        [0018] First and second bender plates 102, 104 may be coupled together or otherwise
positioned to provide an internal cavity 106 between first and second bender plates 102, 104.
First and second bender plates 102, 104 may also be coupled to one another in a manner that
allows first and second bender plates 102, 104 to bend and generate the desired pressure waves.
In particular embodiments, first and second bender plates 102, 104 may be coupled to one
another at their outer edges. In one non-limiting embodiment, first and second bender plates 102,
104 may be coupled together by outer wall 108. Outer wall 108 may be in the form of a hoop or
other suitable structure. Outer wall 108 may be sized to maintain a separation (e.g., a gap)
between first and second bender plates 102, 104.
        [0019] Operation of dipole-type source 100 will now be described in more detail with
reference to FIGS. 1A to IC. FIG. 1A illustrates dipole-type source 100 including first and
second bender plates 102, 104 at rest. A driver (e.g., one or more drivers 1000, 1002 shown in
FIG. 10A) may be operated to cause first and second bender plates 102, 104 to bend such that
they oscillate substantially synchronously. First and second bender plates 102, 104 may bend in
substantial synchrony in a first direction shown by arrows 110 (FIG. 1B) to create positive
pressure below and negative pressure above dipole-type source 100. Then, bend in substantial
synchrony in a second direction as shown by arrows 112 (FIB. IC) to create positive pressure
above and negative pressure below dipole-type source 100. This oscillating movement may be
repeated for a period of time to generate a pressure wave field. As first and second bender plates
102, 104 oscillate in substantial synchrony, dipole-type source 100 may generate an up-going
wave and a down-going wave with opposite polarity. As can be seen on FIGS. lB and IC the
first and second bender plates 102, 104 bend in the same direction substantially synchronously
without a total volume change in internal cavity 106, for example, a volume change in internal
cavity of less than 1%, less than 0. 5 %, or even less.
        [0020] FIG. 2A illustrates generation of a pressure wave field 200 in body of water 202
by dipole-type source 100 in accordance with example embodiments.          Dipole-type source 100
may be positioned in body of water 202 below a water surface 204. Dipole-type source 100 may
be operated in body of water 202 to generate pressure waves with opposite polarity, illustrated on
FIG. 2A as down-going wave 206 and up-going wave 208 with opposite polarity. Down-going
wave 206 may be at a low frequency. In some embodiments, down-going wave 206 may have a
very low frequency, for example, from about 0.75 Hz to about 10 Hz, and specifically, from
                                                 -5-

about 3 Hz to about 6 Hz, about 1.5 Hz to 3 Hz, or about 0.75 Hz to 1.5 Hz. The down-going
wave 206 and the up-going wave 208 are considered to have opposite polarity where the pressure
amplitude at the same distance from the source has an opposite sign. For example, down-going
wave 206 may have a pressure amplitude A(x,y,z;t), while up-going wave 208 may be created
with reverse polarity, or have a pressure amplitude at the same distance from the source
-A(x,y,-z;t), assuming the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system at the center of the source
with positive z-axis pointing downwards. Up-going wave 208 may also be at a low frequency.
In some embodiments, up-going wave 208 may have a very low frequency, for example, from
about 0.75 Hz to about 10 Hz, and specifically, from about 3 Hz to about 6 Hz, about 1.5 Hz to 3
Hz, or about 0.75 Hz to 1.5 Hz.. As illustrated by FIG. 2B, up-going wave 208 may be reflected
off water surface 204 to provide reflected wave 210, which may then have the same polarity as
the down-going wave 206. At low frequencies, these two down-going waves (e.g., down-going
wave 206 and reflected wave 210) may combine substantially in-phase to provide a composite
wave 212 that is down going.
         [0021] FIG. 3 illustrates a model 300 for calculating a pressure wave field 200 generated
by dipole-type source 100 (e.g., FIG. 1).        As illustrated, a pressure wave field 200 may be
enclosed by a spherical surface 302 representing an outer border of the model and an inner
surface, surrounding the oscillating first and second bender plates 102, 104 of dipole-type source
100, representing an inner border. By applying the acoustic representation theorem to model
300, the pressure wave field inside model 300 can be expressed as shown on FIG. 3 free of body
forces. Model 300 can be expressed by surface integrals of the free space Green's function g, the
pressure p, and the gradients of the pressure wave field and Green's function on spherical surface
302 delimiting model 300 and the inner surfaces delimiting dipole-type source 100. By letting
circular surface 302 go to infinity and applying a radiation condition, such as Sommerfield's
radiation condition, the pressure p can be written as a surface integral enclosing the volume of
the dipole-type source:
       P (XR, t) = f,,,,_(   (X, XR, t) * VP (X, t)  -  V9(X, XR, t) * p (x, t)) -ndS          (1)
wherein p is pressure,   XR is position vector indicating a receiver location, t is time, S+ is surface
area of first bender plate 102, S. is surface area of second bender plate 104, g is the Green's
function, x is position vector on the surface of integration,           Vp(x, t) is the gradient of the
                                                    -6-

pressure wave field on surfaces of first bender plate 102 and second bender plate 104 as a
function of x and t, Vg (x, XR, t) is the gradient of the Green's function on surfaces of first bender
plate 102 and second bender plate 104 as a function of x,        XR,  and t, n is normal vector, dS is
surface element, * indicates time convolution, and -dot product. Equation 1 assumes that the
surface surrounding the total removed volume is given solely by the surface areas S. and S_ of the
first and second bender plates 102, 104. That is, the distance between the surfaces of the first
and second bender plates 102, 104 is much smaller than the surface areas S. and S. of the first
and second bender plates 102, 104. Assuming the direction of the normal vector n is from S_ to
S. as illustrated in Figure 3, the integral over the entire surface can be expressed as:
     P (XR,t0 = f,(g(X,XR,t0 * VP(X,t) -V9g(X, XR, 0          * p(x, t)) -ndS
                               f,-y(X,XR, t) * Vp(x,t)      - V(X,XR, t) *p(x, t))      ndS  (2)
         [0022] In Equation 2, no assumptions have been made regarding the Green's functions or
pressure wave fields on the surfaces of the first and second bender plates 102, 104. Continuity of
the pressure gradients can be assumed such that they move in the same direction across the first
and second bender plates 102, 104. That is, particle velocities across the first and second bender
plates 102, 104 are the same. This is a valid assumption for first and second bender plates 102,
104 that oscillate in synchrony as in dipole-type source 100. Continuity can be imposed for the
Green's functions and its derivatives across the surfaces areas S. and S_. Thus, a boundary
condition on the Green's functions can be imposed without affecting the generality of this
example such that the Equation 2 reduces to:
             P(XRt0 = - S V9(X, XR,t0 * [p (x, t)] ndS                                (3)
         [0023] The brackets [. . .] in Equation 3 denote the difference of pressure wave field
transmitted to the surrounding liquid across the surface areas S. and S_.          For a homogeneous
marine environment surrounding the bender plates, the free space Green's function can be used,
as given by:
               9 (XxR>            IR-                                                  (4)
                                                   -7-

where c is the propagation velocity in water. Equation 3 is an expression for calculating the
pressure wave field generated by dipole-type source 100.
         [0024] Before computing the pressure wave field generated by dipole-type source 100
from Equation 3, the gradient of the free space Green's function can be derived. Assuming the
first and second bender plates 102, 104 are planar and oscillate along the z-axis, the derivative of
the free space Green's function can be derived as shown in Equation 5:
               -z9g(x,xR,0  =      R    (X,XR,    c     -    9 (X>     R,t)                (5)
                               IXR-XI 2           CIR     Ia
         [0025] This derivative has a term decaying with           12,      which can affect only the near
field behavior, and another term (the far field) decaying with               I , which is the term relevant
for reflection seismic exploration.        Note that  ZR-z   represents a cosine scaling, which is
                                                     |XR-X|
responsible for the directivity of dipole-type source 100.
         [0026] FIGS. 4-7 illustrate comparisons of computed pressure wave fields for a
monopole-type source and dipole-type source 100 (e.g., FIG. 1) on FIG. 1) in homogeneous
media. The monopole-type source and dipole-type source 100 are both in the form of benders.
Pressure wave fields were computed above and below the monopole-type source and were also
computed for dipole-type source 100 at the same distance and angle from dipole-type source
100. FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate computed pressure wave fields from a monopole-type source, which
is located at a depth of 80 meters. FIG. 4 is the computed pressure wave field at 15 meters (i.e.,
65 meters above the monopole-type source) while FIG. 5 is the computed pressure wave field at
145 meters (i.e., 65 meters below the monopole-type source). FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate computed
pressure wave fields from dipole-type source 100 (e.g., FIG. 1), which is located at a depth of 80
meters. FIG. 6 is the computed pressure wave field at 15 meters (i.e., 65 meters above dipole
type source 100) while FIG. 7 is the computed pressure wave field at 145 meters (i.e., 65 meters
below the dipole-type source 100). As illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5, the pressure wave field is the
same above and below the monopole-type source. In contrast, the pressure wave fields above
and below dipole-type source 100 shown on FIGS. 6 and 7 have different signs (i.e., opposite
polarity), which is because of the directionality of dipole-type source 100.
         [0027] Accordingly, FIGS. 4-7 illustrate the different behaviors of monopole-type
sources and dipole-type sources 100. The different behaviors of the monopole-type sources and
                                                 -8-

the dipole-type sources 100 can be combined using an angle dependent scaling.              Such a
combination can be used for separating the generated pressure wave fields into upwards and
downwards propagating components.        Such obtained source-side wave field separation can be
similar to the dual sensor separation on the receiver side.
         [0028] FIGS. 8 and 9 illustrate a comparison of source ghosts for dipole-type source 100
(FIG. 8) (e.g., FIG. 1) and a monopole-type source (FIG. 9) at a depth of 80 meters where the
sweeps start with a frequency of 1 hertz.      FIG. 8 is an amplitude spectrum from dipole-type
source 100 while FIG. 9 is an amplitude spectrum from a monopole-type source. The source
ghost effect from dipole-type source 100 and monopole-type source illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9
can be analyzed using the generated pressure wave field in a homogeneous half space with flat
free surface at z =  0. The two ghost functions are complementary with the amplitude spectrum
starting with a maximum at a frequency of 0 hertz for dipole-type source 100 and the amplitude
spectrum starting with null at a frequency of 0 hertz for the monopole-type source. Because of
the spectral behavior of the ghost function for dipole-type source 100 with the highest values at
the lowest frequencies, the dipole-type source may be well-suited for generating pressure wave
fields with frequencies at the low frequency end of the amplitude spectra.
         [0029] Accordingly, a combination of dipole-type source 100 and monopole-type sources
may be suitable for generating a broad frequency band, for example, from about 0.1 Hz to about
100 Hz, and dipole-type sources 100 of very low frequencies, from about 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz, or
about 0.1 Hz to 5 Hz. In at least one embodiment, the low frequencies of dipole-type source can
be enhanced by the ghost function of dipole-type source 100. Dipole-type source 100 can be
towed at any depth and generate very low frequency pressure wave fields. For example, dipole
type source 100 may be towed as shallow 10 m, the depths of conventional airgun sources and as
deep as 75 meters, 150 meters, or even deeper.
         [0030] FIGS. 1OA to 1OC illustrate another example embodiment of dipole-type source
100. As illustrated, dipole-type source 100 may include two sound radiating surfaces, in the form
of first bender plate 102 and second bender plate 104 that may bend and flex to generate pressure
waves. In the illustrated embodiment, first and second bender plates 102, 104 of FIGS. 1OA to
10C may be similar in structure and function to the preceding description with respect to FIG. 1.
Dipole-type source 100 may also include one or more drivers 1000, 1002. The one or more
drivers 1000, 1002 will be referred to herein collectively as one or more drivers 1000, 1002 and
                                                -9-

individually as first driver 1000 and second driver 1002. One or more drivers 1000, 1002 may
drive the first and second bender plates 102, 104 to generate pressure waves (e.g., down-going
wave 206 and up-going wave 208 on FIG. 2A) having opposite polarity. For example, first
bender plate 102 and second bender plate 104 may act in a phase opposite to the other such that
the first and second bender plates 102, 104 oscillate substantially synchronously in the same
direction. By oscillation substantially synchronously of first and second bender plates in the
same direction, dipole-type source 100 may generate pressure waves with opposite polarity.
         [0031] In the illustrated embodiment, dipole-type source 100 may include an internal
cavity 106. As illustrated, internal cavity 106 may be provided between first and second bender
plates 102, 104. In some embodiments, dividing wall 1008 separates internal cavity 106 into first
cavity 1004 and second cavity 1006. The first cavity 1004 and the second cavity 1006 may be
sealed from one another such that there is no fluid communication between the first cavity 1004
and the second cavity 1006. First and second cavities 1004, 1006 may each be configured to hold
a volume of a fluid, which may be a gas, such as air or another compressible fluid or gaseous
substance, or liquid, such as water. In some embodiments, the fluid may comprise pressurized
air, in that the air is at a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure. The fluid in first cavity 1004
and second cavity 1006 may be the same in each of first and second cavities 1004, 1006 or
different. The volume of fluid within first and second cavities 1004, 1006 may be dependent on
the volume of first and second cavities 1004, 1006, which in turn would depend on their
respective dimensions (e.g., diameter, length, height, etc.). In some embodiments, the volume of
fluid within first and second cavities 1004, 1006 may be pressurized, for example, above
atmospheric. In marine applications, for example, pressurizing and maintaining the volume of
fluid within first and second cavities 1004, 1006 at an ambient hydrostatic pressure at an
operating water depth may protect dipole-type source 100 from collapsing from ambient
hydrostatic pressure.
         [0032] As illustrated, internal cavity 106 may also include ports, such as first port 1007
and second port 1009. First and second ports 1007, 1009 may serve as apertures for transporting
fluid to and from the internal cavity 106. For example, first port 1007 may serve as an aperture in
outer wall 108 for transporting fluid to and from first cavity 1004, and second port 1009 may
serve as an aperture in outer wall 108 for transporting fluid to and from second cavity 1006.
While FIGS. 10A to 1OC illustrate two ports (e.g., first port 1007 and second port 1009), it
                                                   - 10 -

should be understood that more than two ports may be formed in outer wall 108 for providing
fluid flow into and out of internal cavity 106. Each of the first port 1007 and second port 1009
may be configured to facilitate fluid flow between internal cavity 106 and one or more drivers
1000, 1002. For example, first port 1007 may facilitate fluid flow between first cavity 1004 and
first driver 1000, and second port 1009 may facilitate fluid flow between second cavity 1006 and
second driver 1002.
         [0033] With continued reference to FIGS. 1OA to 1OC, one or more drivers 1000, 1002
may be in fluid communication with the fluid in internal cavity 106. For example, first driver
1000 may be in fluid communication with first cavity 1004 and second driver 1002 may be in
fluid communication with second cavity 1006. First conduit 1010 may couple first driver 1000 to
first cavity 1004, and second conduit 1012 may couple second driver 1002 to second cavity
1006. While first and second conduits 1010 and 1012 are shown on FIGS. 1OA to 1OC, it should
be understood that first and second conduits 1010 and 1012 may not be necessary for coupling
one or more drivers 1000, 1002 to internal cavity 106. For example, one or more drivers 1000,
1002 may be directly coupled to outer wall 108 or first and second conduits 1010, 1012 may be
internal to one or more drivers 1000, 1002.
         [0034] When one or more drivers 1000, 1002 are actuated, one or more drivers 1000,
1002 may cause fluid to flow into, and out of, internal cavity 106 (e.g., flowing into first cavity
1004 while flowing out of second cavity 1006), thus causing first and second bender plates 102,
104 to bend, flex, or otherwise be deformed, resulting in vibration and output of pressure waves.
By controlling actuation of one or more drivers 1000, 1002 so that the fluid entering and exiting
the internal cavity 106 is controlled, first and second bender plates 102, 104 may oscillate
synchronously in opposite phase. In operation, the pressure in first and second cavities 1004,
1006 and the bending of first and second bender plates 102, 104 may be in opposite phase. FIG.
1OA illustrates dipole-type source 100 at rest prior to actuation of one or more drivers 1000,
1002. As illustrated on FIG. 1OB, one or more drivers 1000, 1002 may be actuated to cause fluid
flow into, and out of, internal cavity 106 to cause first and second bender plates 102, 104 to bend
in substantial synchrony in a first direction shown by arrows 110. To cause this movement in the
first direction 110, fluid may flow into second cavity 1006 while additional fluid is flowing out
of first cavity 1004. As illustrated on FIG. 1OC, one or more drivers 1000, 1002 may then be
actuated to cause first and second bender plates 102, 104 to bend in a second direction (opposite
                                                - 11 -

first direction 110) direction as shown by arrows 112. To cause this movement in the second
direction 112, fluid may flow out of second cavity 1006 while the additional fluid is flowing into
first cavity 1004. This oscillating movement of first and second bender plates 102, 104 in first
direction 110 followed by second direction 112 may be repeated for a period of time to generate
a pressure wave field. As the first and second bender plates 102, 104 oscillate in substantial
synchrony, dipole-type source 100 may generate an up-going wave and a down-going wave with
opposite polarity.
         [0035] One or more drivers 1000, 1002 may be any suitable driver for actuation of
dipole-type source 100. In some embodiments, one or more drivers 1000, 1002 should cause
fluid to flow into, and out of, internal cavity 106. In some embodiments, one or more drivers
1000, 1002 may be an electroacoustic transducer for generation of acoustic energy. In non
limiting embodiments, the electroacoustic transducer may generate force by vibrating a portion
of its surface. In other embodiments, one or more drivers 1000, 1002 may be a linear motor,
which may be a linear magnetic motor that may be energized electrically. A suitable linear motor
may include stationary electric coils and a magnetic component (e.g., a magnetic cylinder) that
passes through a magnetic field generated by the stationary electric coils, or vice versa.
         [0036] Dipole-type source 100 may further include a control system 1014. The control
system 1014 may be part of a recording system (e.g., recording system 1206 on FIG. 12) or a
different computer.    Control system 1014 may be communicatively coupled to one or more
drivers 1000, 1002 by a communication link 1016, which may be wired, wireless, or a
combination thereof. Control system 1014 may include hardware and software that operate to
control one or more drivers 1000, 1002. For example, control system 1004 may include a
processor 1018 (e.g., microprocessor, central processing unit, etc.) that may process data by
executing software or instructions obtained from a local or remote non-transitory, tangible
computer readable media 1020 (e.g., optical disks, magnetic disks). Processor 1018 may include
any type of computational circuit, such as a microprocessor, a complex instruction set computing
(CISC) microprocessor, a reduced instruction set computing (RISC) microprocessor, a very long
instruction word (VLIW) microprocessor, a digital signal processor (DSP), or any other type of
processor, processing circuit, execution unit, or computational machine. It should be understood
that embodiments of the control system 1014 should not be limited to the specific processors
listed herein. Non-transitory, tangible computer-readable media 1020 may store software or
                                               - 12 -

instructions of the methods described herein. Non-transitory, tangible computer readable media
1020 may include any instrumentality or aggregation of instrumentalities that may retain data
and/or instructions for a period of time. Non-transitory, tangible computer-readable media 1020
may include, for example, without limitation, storage media such as a direct access storage
device (e.g., a hard disk drive or floppy disk drive), a sequential access storage device (e.g., a
tape disk drive), compact         disk, CD-ROM, DVD, RAM, ROM, electrically               erasable
programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and/or flash memory; as well as communications
media such wires, optical fibers, microwaves, radio waves, and other electromagnetic and/or
optical carriers; and/or any combination of the foregoing. Control system 1014 may also include
input device(s) 1022 (e.g., keyboard, mouse, touchpad, etc.) and output device(s) 1024 (e.g.,
monitor, printer, etc.). Input device(s) 1022 and output device(s) 1024 provide a user interface
that enables an operator to interact with one or more drivers 1000, 1002 and/or software executed
by processor 1018. In some embodiments, control system 1014 may take measurements from
one or more sensors (not shown) to change the signal used to control one or more drivers 1000,
1002.
         [0037] FIG. 11 illustrates a plurality of dipole-type sources 100 arranged in a stack
assembly 1102. Dipole-type sources 100 in stack assembly 1102 may have the general
configuration of the dipole-type source 100 described herein, for example, with respect to FIGs.
1, 2A-2B, 10A-10C, and FIG. 12. As illustrated, stack assembly 1102 may include a plurality of
dipole-type sources 100 arranged in a stack configuration. Stack assembly 1102 may further
comprise first manifolds 1104 and second manifolds 1106 for supplying fluid to internal cavities
(e.g., internal cavity 106 on FIG. 10A) of the dipole-type sources 100. First manifolds 1104 and
second manifolds 1106 may each include a hose, pipe, segment thereof, or other similar
component. By way of example, first manifolds 1104 may supply fluid to first cavities (e.g., first
cavity 1004 on FIG. I0A) and second manifolds 1106 may supply fluid to second cavities (e.g.,
second cavity 1006 on FIG. 10 A). The embodiment illustrated in FIG. 11 also shows that stack
assembly 1102 may include a first plate 1108 and second plate 1110 to which the dipole-type
sources 100 may be coupled. First plate 1108 and second plate 1110 may function, for example,
to provide structural support to stack assembly 1102. Dipole-type sources 100 may be arranged
between first plate 1108 and second plate 1110 to form a stack configuration of dipole-type
sources 100. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 11, stack assembly 1102 may further include
                                               - 13 -

stack support structures 1112, which may extend between first plate 1108 and second plate 1110.
Stack support structures 1112 may have any suitable configuration, including, but not limited to,
rods, bars, beams, and the like. Stack support structures 1112 may be coupled to the dipole-type
sources 100, for example, to hold dipole-type sources 100 in place within stack assembly 1102. It
should be understood that stack assembly 1102 shown on FIG. 11 is merely illustrative and other
suitable configurations of dipole-type sources 100 arranged in a stack configuration may be used
in particular embodiments.
         [0038] FIG. 12 illustrates a marine seismic survey system 1200 in accordance with
example embodiments. Marine seismic survey system 1200 may include a survey vessel 1202
that moves along the surface of a body of water 1204, such as a lake or ocean. Survey vessel
1202 may include thereon equipment, shown generally at 1206 and collectively referred to herein
as a "recording system." Recording system 1206 may include devices (none shown separately)
for detecting and making a time indexed record of signals generated by each of seismic sensors
1208 (explained further below) and for actuating dipole-type source 100 at selected times.
Recording system 1206 may also include devices (none shown separately) for determining the
geodetic position of the survey vessel 1202 and the various seismic sensors 1208.
         [0039] As illustrated, the survey vessel 1202 or a different vessel may tow dipole-type
source 100. Although only a single dipole-type source 100 is shown, it should be understood
that more than one dipole-type source 100 (or additional monopole-type sources) may be used,
which may be towed by the survey vessel 1202 or different survey vessels, for example, as
desired for a particular application. Dipole-type source 100 may include one or more of the
features described herein, for example, with respect to FIGS. 1-3 and 10. Also illustrated on FIG.
12 with dipole-type source 100 is a monopole-type source 1216. Monopole-type source 1216
may also be towed by survey vessel 1202. Non-limiting examples of suitable sources for use as
the monopole-type source 1216 includes air guns, marine vibrators, and benders. Although only
a single monopole-type source 1216 is shown, it should be understood that more than one
monopole-type source 1216 may be used. As previously mentioned, using the dipole-type source
100 in combination with the monopole-type source 1216 may be suited for generating a broad
frequency band. In some embodiments, the monopole-type sources 1216 may be towed in a
stack assembly 1102 (as shown on FIG. 11 with reference to dipole-type sources 100). While
                                               - 14 -

FIG. 11 shows stack assembly 1102 with reference to dipole-type sources 100, it should be
understood that monopole-type sources 1216 may also be arranged in a stack configuration.
         [0040] With continued reference to FIG. 12, survey vessel 1202 may further tow sensor
streamer 1210. Sensor streamer 1210 may be towed in a selected pattern in body of water 1204
by survey vessel 1202 or a different vessel. While not shown, survey vessel 1202 may tow a
plurality of sensor streamers 1210, which may be spaced apart behind the survey vessel 1202.
Sensor streamers 1210 may each be formed, for example, by coupling a plurality of streamer
segments (none shown separately).        The configuration of sensor streamer 1210 on FIG. 12 is
provided to illustrate an example embodiment and is not intended to limit the present disclosure.
It should be noted that, while the present example, shows only a single sensor streamer 1210, the
present disclosure is applicable to any number of sensor streamers 1210 towed by survey vessel
1202 or any other vessel. Sensor streamer 1210 may include seismic sensors 1208 thereon at
spaced apart locations. Seismic sensors 1208 may be any type of seismic sensors known in the
art, including, but not limited to, hydrophones, geophones, particle velocity sensors, particle
displacement sensors, particle acceleration sensors, or pressure gradient sensors, for example.
While not illustrated, seismic sensors 1208 may alternatively be disposed on ocean bottom cables
or subsurface acquisition nodes in addition to, or in place of, sensor streamer 1210.
         [0041] During operation, certain equipment (not shown separately) in the recording
system 1206 (e.g., control system 1014 on FIGS. 10A-0C) may cause dipole-type source 100 to
actuate at selected times. When actuated, dipole-type source 100 may produce pressure waves
with opposite polarity (e.g., down-going wave 206 and up-going wave 208 on FIGS. 2A and 2B).
The pressure waves may travel downwardly through the body of water 1204 and may pass, at
least in part, through one or more formations 1212 below water bottom 1214. Pressure waves
may be at least partially reflected in one or more formations 1212 and then travel upwardly for
detection at seismic sensors 1208. Seismic sensors 1208 may generate response signals, such as
electrical or optical signals, in response to detecting the pressure waves emitted from dipole-type
source 100 after interaction with one or more formations 1212. Signals generated by seismic
sensors 1208 may be communicated to recording system 1206.                Structure of one or more
formations 1212 among other properties, may be inferred, for example, by analysis of the
detected energy, such as its amplitude, phase, and travel time.
                                                 - 15 -

        [0042] In accordance with example embodiments, a geophysical data product may be
produced from the detected pressure waves.        The geophysical data product may be used to
evaluate certain properties of one or more formations 1212. The geophysical data product may
include acquired and/or processed seismic data and may be stored on a non-transitory, tangible
computer-readable medium. The geophysical data product may be produced offshore (i.e., by
equipment on a vessel) or onshore (i.e., at a facility on land) either within the United States
and/or in another country. Specifically, embodiments may include producing a geophysical data
product from at least the measured seismic energy and recording the geophysical data product on
a non-transitory, tangible computer-readable medium suitable for importing onshore.            If the
geophysical data product is produced offshore and/or in another country, it may be imported
onshore to a facility in, for example, the United States or another country. Once onshore in, for
example, the United States (or another country), further processing and/or geophysical analysis
may be performed on the geophysical data product.
