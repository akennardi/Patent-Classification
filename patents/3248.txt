   Description of Embodiment
          The design flexibility of the conventional battery modules is
   limited by the wiring for monitoring, for example, the voltage of the
30 battery cells.
          In other words, in the conventional battery pack, since it is
   necessary for the battery modules housed in the pack case to have a
   configuration designed for the wiring, the configuration thereof is
   constrained, limiting the design flexibility of the battery modules.
35        The present invention was conceived in view of the above and
                                       - 2-

   aspects of the present invention provide an energy storage apparatus
   having increased design flexibility.
           An energy storage apparatus according to one aspect of the
   present invention includes: one or more energy storage devices; a
 5 wiring connection component for connecting first wiring and second
   wiring, the first wiring being connected to at least one of the one or
   more energy storage devices, the second wiring being external
   wiring; and an attachment portion to which the wiring connection
   component is detachably attached.
10         With this, the energy storage apparatus is configured such
   that the wiring connection component, which is for connecting
   together (i) the first wiring connected to the energy storage device
   and (ii) the external second wiring, is detachably attachable to the
   attachment portion.     For this reason, even if the configuration of the
15 energy storage apparatus is changed, it is possible to connect wiring
   designed for the configuration of the energy storage apparatus by
   changing out the wiring connection component.             Moreover, when
   there is no need to connect wiring to the energy storage apparatus,
   it is possible to simplify the configuration of the energy storage
20 apparatus     by,  for  example,    removing     the   wiring  connection
   component, or attaching a wiring connection component to which
   unnecessary connectors are not attached.        In this way, providing the
   detachably attachable wiring connection component increases the
   design flexibility of the energy storage apparatus.
25         Moreover, the energy storage apparatus may be disposed in an
   energy storage pack in which a different energy storage apparatus is
   also disposed, and the wiring connection component may connect the
   first wiring, which is connected to the wiring connection component,
   and the second wiring, which is connected to the wiring connection
30 component and to the different energy storage apparatus.
           With this configuration, the wiring connection component
   makes     it  possible  to   connect    together   two    energy   storage
   apparatuses in the energy storage pack.       In other words, even if the
   two energy storage apparatuses have different configurations, it is
35 possible to connect the two energy storage apparatuses together by
                                       - 3 -

   attaching     wiring    connection     components     that   match   the
   configurations of the energy storage apparatuses, thereby increasing
   the design flexibility of the energy storage apparatuses.
           Moreover, the wiring connection component may include: a
 5 connector to which the first wiring is connected; a connector holder
   for holding the connector; and a main body to which the connector
   holder is detachably attached.
          With this, the wiring connection component is configured such
   that the connector holder for holding the connector is detachably
10 attachable     to  the   main    body.     Consequently,    even  if the
   configuration of the energy storage apparatus is changed, it is
   possible to connect wiring designed for the configuration of the
   energy storage apparatus by changing out the connector holder.
   Moreover, when there is no need to connect wiring to the energy
15 storage apparatus, it is possible to simplify the configuration of the
   energy storage apparatus by, for example, removing the connector
   holder, or attaching a connector holder to which             unnecessary
   connectors are not attached.       In this way, providing the detachably
   attachable connector holder increases the design flexibility of the
20 energy storage apparatus.
           Moreover, the main body may include a curved guide portion
   that guides the first wiring.
          With this configuration, since the main body of the wiring
   connection component includes the curved guide portion that guides
25 the first wiring, the first wiring can be easily connected to the wiring
   connection component without bending and such.
           Moreover, each of the one or more energy storage devices may
   include a positive terminal and a negative terminal, and the wiring
   connection component may be located on a side of the energy
30 storage apparatus, the side being an end of the energy storage
   apparatus in a direction in which the positive terminal and the
   negative terminal are aligned.
          With this configuration, the wiring connection component is
35 located on a side of the energy storage apparatus, which is an end of
                                        -4-

   the energy storage apparatus, in the direction in which the positive
   terminal and the negative terminal of the energy storage device are
   aligned.    Here, when the substrate including the first wiring is
   disposed in the space between the positive terminal and the negative
 5 terminal of the energy storage device, the substrate is not disposed
   at the end of the energy storage apparatus in the above-described
   direction of alignment.    Consequently, in a configuration in which
   the connector is provided on the substrate, the positive terminal and
   the negative terminal are obstructive, making it difficult to connect
10 the second wiring from the side (end)         of the energy storage
   apparatus in the above-described direction of alignment. However,
   by disposing the wiring connection component on the side of the
   energy storage      apparatus  in the above-described     direction of
   alignment, the positive terminal and the negative terminal of the
15 energy storage devices are not obstructive even when the substrate
   is disposed in the space between the positive terminal and the
   negative terminal, and the second wiring can be easily connected
   from the side of the energy storage apparatus in the above-described
   direction of alignment.    As such, even when the second wiring is
20 arranged on the side of the energy storage apparatus in the
   above-described direction of alignment, the second wiring can be
   easily connected from the side of the energy storage apparatus in the
   above-described direction of alignment by connecting the second
   wiring to the connector of the wiring connection component.
25         Moreover, the wiring connection component may be located on
   a short side of the energy storage apparatus.
          With    this  configuration,    since the   wiring  connection
   component is located on the short side of the energy storage
   apparatus, when, for example, the energy storage apparatus is
30 inserted into a stacked housing including the second wiring arranged
   on the above-described short side, the second wiring can be easily
   connected to the wiring connection component.
           Moreover, the energy storage apparatus may further include: a
   plurality of openings for attaching the wiring connection component;
35 and a blocking component that blocks, among the plurality of
                                      -5-

   openings, an opening at which the wiring connection component is
   not attached.
          With this configuration, since the energy storage apparatus
   includes the blocking component that blocks, among the plurality of
 5 openings for attachment of the wiring connection component, an
   opening at which the wiring connection component is not attached, it
   possible to keep foreign matter from entering the energy storage
   apparatus through the opening.            In particular, when the energy
   storage apparatus is cooled by drawing air therein using, for
10 example, a fan, there is concern that foreign matter could be drawn
   in with the air, but it is possible to keep foreign matter from entering
   with the provision of the blocking component.
           Moreover, the energy        storage    apparatus  may   include a
   plurality of module units each including the one or more energy
15 storage devices.    The wiring connection component may include an
   external wiring connection component detachably attached to the
   attachment portion of an outermost one of the plurality of module
   units.
          With this configuration, since the energy storage apparatus
20 includes a plurality of module units, and the wiring connection
   component     includes an     external     wiring  connection  component
   detachably attached to the attachment portion of an outermost one
   of the plurality of module units, it is possible to easily connect the
   second wiring to the energy storage apparatus with the external
25 wiring connection component.           Moreover, it is possible to easily
   configure the energy storage apparatus by lining up the plurality
   module units having simple structures.
           Moreover, the energy storage apparatus may further include: a
   substrate disposed in, among the plurality of module units, the
30 module unit to which the external wiring connection component is
   attached.
          With this configuration, in the energy storage apparatus, since
   the substrate is disposed in the module unit provided with the
   external wiring connection component, it is possible to shorten the
35 cable connecting the connector and the substrate by disposing the
                                         -6-

   substrate close to the connector.
           Moreover, the energy storage apparatus may further include a
   cooling apparatus that introduces a coolant into the plurality of
   module units.      The substrate may be disposed in,        among the
 5 plurality of module units, the module unit located upstream of flow of
   the coolant.
          With this configuration, since the substrate is disposed in the
   module unit located upstream of the flow of the coolant introduced by
   the  cooling apparatus,     it is  possible to   limit an  increase   in
10 temperature of the substrate from the heat generated by the energy
   storage device since the coolant introduced comes into contact with
   the substrate.
           Moreover, the energy      storage   apparatus  may   include a
   plurality of module units each including the one or more energy
15 storage devices.    The wiring connection component may include a
   wiring duct bridging two of the plurality of module units so as to form
   a path for wiring passing between the two of the plurality of module
   units.
          With this configuration, since the energy storage apparatus
20 includes the plurality of module units and the wiring connection
   component includes the wiring duct which forms a path for wiring
   passing between two of the module units, wiring between two module
   units can be performed easily.
           Moreover, each of the plurality of module units may include the
25 two attachment portions to each of which the wiring duct is
   detachably attachable, and the wiring duct may be detachably
   attached to and bridge two adjacent ones of the attachment portions
   included in the two adjacent module units.
          With this configuration, since each of the plurality of module
30 units includes the two attachment portions to each of which the
   wiring duct is detachably attachable, it is possible to change out the
   wiring duct when necessary.
           Hereinafter, the energy storage apparatus according to an
   exemplary embodiment of the present invention is described in
35 greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.           It
                                       - 7-

   should be noted that the embodiment described below shows a
   preferred, specific example of the present invention.       The numerical
   values, shapes, materials, structural elements, the arrangement and
   connection of the structural elements etc. shown in the following
 5 embodiment are mere examples, and therefore do not limit the
   present invention.     Moreover, among the structural elements in the
   following embodiment, structural elements not recited in any one of
   the independent claims defining the most generic part of the
   inventive concept are described as arbitrary structural elements.
10 (Embodiment)
           First, the configuration of an energy storage apparatus 1 will
   be described.
           FIG. 1 is an external perspective view of the energy storage
   apparatus 1 according to the embodiment of the present invention.
15 FIG.   2   is an   exploded   perspective view illustrating     structural
   components of the energy storage apparatus 1.
           It should be noted that the Z axis is shown as being the vertical
   direction in FIG.1 and FIG. 2.     The Z axis is exemplified as being the
   vertical direction in the following description as well, but depending
20 on the mode of use, it is conceivable that the Z axis may be a
   direction other than the vertical direction.    As such, the Z axis is not
   limited to the vertical direction.   The same applies to other drawings
   as well.
           The energy storage apparatus 1 is an energy storage module
25 capable     of  charging  electricity    from an   external   source   and
   discharging electricity to an external device.       The energy storage
   apparatus 1 is, for example, a high-voltage battery module used to
   store energy and/or used as a power source.
           As is illustrated in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the energy storage
30 apparatus 1 includes a module group 10 including module units 11,
    12, and 13, a lower coupling component 20, an upper coupling
   component 30, and a cooling apparatus 40.         It should be noted that
   the energy storage apparatus 1 may include only one module unit.
           The module units 11, 12, and 13 included in the module group
35  10 are aligned along the X axis. The module unit 11 includes an
                                        -8-

   external positive terminal cover 11a which covers the external
   positive terminal (to be described later) and an external negative
   terminal cover 11b which covers the external negative terminal (to
   be described later).     The energy storage apparatus         1 charges
 5 electricity from an external source and discharges electricity to an
   external device through the external positive terminal under the
   external positive terminal cover 11a and the external negative
   terminal under the external negative terminal cover 11b.
          The module units 11, 12, and 13 are rectangular modules
10 including one or more energy storage devices housed in a module
   case 14.    Each of the module units 11, 12, and 13 has the same
   configuration.    Moreover, the     positive terminals   and   negative
   terminals of adjacent ones of the module units 11, 12, and 13 are
   electrically connected, whereby all energy storage devices in the
15 module units 11, 12, and 13 are connected in series.       It should be
   noted that the configuration of the module group 10 will be described
   in detail later.
          The lower coupling component 20 and the upper coupling
   component 30 are components which couple the module units 11, 12,
20 and 13 together. The lower coupling component 20 couples the
   module units 11,    12, and 13 from below and the upper coupling
   component 30 couples the module units 11, 12, and 13 from above.
   In other words, fixing the lower coupling component 20 and the
   upper coupling component 30 together with the module units 11, 12,
25 and 13 disposed therebetween couples the module units 11, 12, and
   13 together.
          More specifically, the lower coupling component 20 and the
   upper coupling component 30 are flat components formed, for
   example, from a conductive material such as metal.       With this, the
30 module units 11, 12, and 13 are firmly and securely fixed.
          Moreover, each module case 14 of the module units 11, 12,
   and 13 is mounted on the lower coupling component 20.
          The cooling apparatus 40 is a fan located on a side of the
   module group 10 in the positive direction of the X axis that
35 introduces a coolant into the module group 10.     In other words, the
                                     -9 -

   cooling apparatus 40 is located in a position opposed to the end of
   the module unit 13 in the direction of alignment of the module units
    11, 12, and 13.     The cooling apparatus 40 draws in outside air (the
   coolant) from the end of the module group 10 in the negative
 5 direction of the X axis, and introduces air into each module case 14
   of the module units 11, 12, and 13.         The cooling apparatus 40 then
   expels the air from the end of the module group 10 in the positive
   direction of the X axis out the back of the cooling apparatus 40.
           It should be noted that the cooling apparatus 40 may draw in
10 outside air from the end of the module group 10 in the positive
   direction of the X axis and expel the air from the end of the module
   group 10 in the negative direction of the X axis.            Moreover, the
   coolant introduced       into the   module     group   10  by the    cooling
   apparatus 40 is not limited to atmospheric air.           For example, the
15 coolant may be cold air chilled by a condenser.        Furthermore, in the
   embodiment, the cooling apparatus 40 is provided with two fans, but
   number of fans the cooling apparatus 40 has is not limited to this
   example.     Still further, the cooling apparatus 40 is not limited to the
   use of a fan.     As long as it introduces the coolant into the module
20 group 10, something other than a fan may be used.
           Next, the configuration of the module group 10 will               be
   described in detail.
           FIG. 3 is a perspective view illustrating internal structural
   components of the module group 10 according to the embodiment of
25 the present invention.         More specifically, FIG.    3 illustrates the
   module group 10 with covers 700 removed so as to show the internal
   configuration of the module group 10.              FIG. 4 is an exploded
   perspective view illustrating structural components of the module
   group 10.
30        As is illustrated in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, each of the module units
    11, 12, and 13 included in the module group 10 includes: the module
   case 14 including a case main body 100 and the cover 700; a plurality
   of energy storage devices 200 (in the embodiment, four of the
   energy storage devices 200 are provided) housed in the module case
35  14; a restricting component 300; and bus bars 430.             The module
                                        - 10 -

   group 10 further includes an external wiring connection component
   510 provided in the module unit 11, a substrate 600 provided in the
   module unit 11, a wiring duct 520 bridging the module units 11, 12,
   and 13, an external wiring connection component 530 provided in the
 5 module unit 13, and a closure 540 provided in the module unit 13.
           Here, the external wiring connection components 510 and 530
   and the wiring duct 520 are wiring connection components for
   connecting together (i) first wiring 440 that is connected to at least
   one of the plurality of energy storage devices 200 and (ii) external
10 second wiring.     In other words, the module units 11, 12, and 13
   include, as the wiring connection component, at least one of the
   external wiring connection component 510, the external wiring
   connection component 530, and the wiring duct 520.
           The module case 14 is a rectangular (box-shaped) container
15 acting as an outer housing for the module units 11, 12, and 13.      The
   module case 14 arranges the energy storage devices 200 and the
   substrate 600 and such in given positions and protects the energy
   storage devices 200 and the substrate 600 and such from impact.
   The module case        14 is  made of a material        having insulating
20 properties, such as a resin, like polycarbonate, for example.        This
   keeps the energy storage device 200 and the substrate 600 and such
   from    coming   into   contact with,    for   example,   external  metal
   components.
           Here, the module case 14 includes the case main body 100 and
25 the cover 700.     The case main body 100 is a rectangular, tubular
   component having a bottom, and serves as the main body of the
   module case 14.         The cover 700 is a low-profile,       rectangular
   component that covers the opening of the case main body 100, and
   serves as the cover of the module case 14.
30         More   specifically, the  energy     storage  devices 200,    the
   restricting component 300, and the bus bars 430 are arranged in this
   order in the case main body 100, and then the opening of the case
   main body 100 is closed off with the cover 700.      Arranging the heavy
   energy storage devices 200 on the bottom in this way improves the
35 stability of the module units 11, 12, and 13.
                                      - 11 -

          Each energy storage device 200 is a battery cell including a
   positive terminal 230 and a negative terminal 240.    A plurality of the
   energy storage devices 200 are housed in the module cases 14 of the
   module units 11, 12, and 13.       It should be noted that one energy
 5 storage device 200 may be housed in the module case 14 instead of
   a plurality of the energy storage devices 200.    Moreover, each of the
   module units 11,     12, and 13 may include a different number of
   energy storage devices 200.          The configuration of the energy
   storage devices 200 will be described in detail later.
10        The    bus  bars  430   are    arranged  above  the   restricting
   component 300.       The bus bars 430 are made of a conductive
   material, such as metal, and electrically connect the energy storage
   devices 200 together.     More specifically, the bus bar 430 connects
   the positive terminal 230 or negative terminal 240 of one of two
15 adjacently arranged energy storage devices 200 to the negative
   terminal 240 or positive terminal 230 of the other of the two
   adjacently arranged energy storage devices 200.
          The module unit 11 moreover includes an external positive
   terminal 410 arranged in the external positive terminal cover 11a
20 and an external negative terminal 420 arranged in the external
   negative terminal cover 11b.      The external positive terminal 410
   and the external negative terminal 420 are electrode terminals for
   charging the energy storage apparatus 1 with electricity from an
   external source and discharging electricity to an external device.     In
25 other words, the energy storage apparatus 1 is charged with
   electricity from an external source and discharges electricity to an
   external device via the external positive terminal 410 and the
   external negative terminal 420.
          More specifically, among the energy storage devices 200
30 included in the energy storage apparatus 1, the positive terminal 230
   of the energy storage device 200 positionally corresponding to the
   external positive terminal 410 is connected to the external positive
   terminal 410, and the negative terminal 240 of the same energy
   storage device 200 is connected to the positive terminal 230 of an
35 adjacent energy storage device 200 with the bus bar 430.      Similarly,
                                      - 12  -

   among the energy storage devices 200 included in the energy
   storage apparatus 1, the negative terminal 240 of the energy storage
   device 200     positionally corresponding to the external negative
   terminal 420 is connected to the external negative terminal 420, and
 5 the positive terminal 230 of the same energy storage device 200 is
   connected to the negative terminal 240 of an adjacent energy
   storage device 200 with the bus bar 430.      The positive terminal 230
   or the negative terminal 240 of other energy storage devices 200 are
   connected to the negative terminal 240 or the positive terminal 230
10 of an adjacent energy storage device 200 with the bus bar 430.
          The restricting component 300 is a low-profile, rectangular
   component arranged above the energy storage devices 200.            The
   restricting component 300 is made of a material having insulating
   properties, such as resin.    Here, the restricting component 300 is a
15 component that restricts the positioning of the energy storage
   devices 200 included in the case main body 100. More specifically,
   the restricting component 300 fits inside the case main body 100 and
   holds down the energy storage device 200 from above, thereby fixing
   the energy storage devices 200 to the case main body 100.
20        The substrate 600 is mounted on and the external wiring
   connection component 510 is attached to the restricting component
   300 of the module unit 11.        Moreover, the wiring ducts 520 are
   attached so as to bridge the restricting components 300 of the
   module units 11 and 12 and bridge the restricting components 300 of
25 the module units 12 and 13.          Furthermore,   the external wiring
   connection component 530 and the closures 540 are attached to the
   restricting component 300 of the module unit 13.
          In this way, the restricting component 300 functions to fix the
   energy storage devices 200 to the case main body 100, functions as
30 a mounting plate for mounting the substrate 600, and functions as an
   attachment     plate for attaching the external       wiring connection
   components 510 and 530, the wiring duct 520, and the closure 540.
   The configuration of the restricting component 300, the external
   wiring connection components 510 and 530, the wiring duct 520, and
35 the closure 540 will be described in detail later.
                                      - 13 -

          The substrate 600 is a control substrate for monitoring
   purposes that obtains the charging state and discharging state (the
   state of the battery, such as voltage or temperature) of the energy
   storage devices 200 included in the module group 10.     The substrate
 5 600 is provided with a control circuit (not shown in the drawings) for
   performing the above-described monitoring, controlling the on and
   off states of a relay, or communicating with other devices.
          More specifically, the substrate 600 is located in the space
   between the positive terminals 230 and the negative terminals 240 of
10 the energy storage devices 200, and is connected to these energy
   storage   devices   200    and  to   the external  wiring   connection
   component 510 via the first wiring 440.      In other words, the first
   wiring 440 is wiring including a lead wire connecting the positive
   terminal 230 or the negative terminal 240 of the energy storage
15 device 200 to the substrate 600, and a cable connecting the
   substrate 600 to the external wiring connection component 510.        It
   should be noted that in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the illustration of the first
   wiring 440 is partially omitted.
          In other words, the first wiring 440 connected to the positive
20 terminals 230 or the negative terminals 240 of the energy storage
   devices 200 included in the module unit 11 extends along the
   perimeter of the substrate 600 and is connected to the external
   wiring connection component 510 via the substrate 600.
          Moreover, the first wiring 440 connected to the positive
25 terminals 230 or the negative terminals 240 of the energy storage
   devices 200 included in the module unit 12 extends along the wiring
   path in the wiring duct 520 bridging the module unit 11 and 12, and
   is connected to the external wiring connection component 510 via the
   substrate 600.
30        Moreover, the first wiring 440 connected to the positive
   terminals 230 or the negative terminals 240 of the energy storage
   devices 200 included in the module unit 13 extends along the wiring
   path in the wiring duct 520 bridging the module unit 12 and 13 and
   along the wiring path in the wiring duct 520 bridging the module unit
35  11 and 12, and is connected to the external wiring connection
                                      - 14-

   component 510 via the substrate 600.
           Similarly,   the   cable connected      to the    external  wiring
   connection component 530 located in the module unit 13 extends
   along the wiring path in the wiring duct 520 bridging the module unit
 5  12 and 13 and along the wiring path in the wiring duct 520 bridging
   the module unit 11 and 12, and is connected to the external wiring
   connection component 510 via the substrate 600.
           The external wiring connection component 510 is connected to
   external second wiring (for example, the second wiring 50 to be
10 described later).      In other words, the external wiring connection
   component 510 is a component that connects together (i) the first
   wiring 440 connected to at least one of the one or more energy
   storage devices 200 and (ii) the external second wiring.
           Here, the external wiring connection component 510 is located
15 on a side of the energy storage apparatus 1, which is an end of the
   apparatus 1 in a direction in which the positive terminal 230 and the
   negative terminal 240       are aligned (X axis).    In other words, the
   external wiring connection component 510 is located on a short side
   of the energy storage apparatus 1 (located on the side in the
20 negative direction of the X axis).         More specifically, the external
   wiring connection component 510 is detachably attached to the side
   of the module unit 11, which is an outermost one of the module units
    11, 12, and 13 (outermost in the direction of alignment of the module
   units), in the negative direction of the X axis.
25         Moreover, the substrate 600 is located on the restricting
   component 300 of the module unit 11, and arranged so as to be
   covered by the cover 700 of the module unit 11.        In other words, the
   substrate 600 is disposed in the module unit 11, which is, among the
   module units 11,      12, and 13, the module unit provided with the
30 external wiring connection component 510 and located upstream
   with respect to the flow of the coolant (air) introduced by the cooling
   apparatus 40.
           In this way, the substrate 600 is arranged so as to be protected
   by the restricting component 300 and the cover 700 as a result of
35 being sandwiched between the restricting component 300 and the
                                       - 15 -

   cover 700 of the module unit 11.    It should be noted that disposition
   of the substrate 600 is not limited to the module unit 11.          The
   substrate 600 may be disposed in the module unit 12 or the module
   unit 13, and may be disposed in the module unit 12 and the module
 5 unit 13 in addition to the module unit 11.
          Next, the configuration of the energy storage device 200 will
   be described in detail.
          FIG. 5 is a transparent perspective view illustrating the inside
   of the energy storage device 200 according to the embodiment of the
10 present invention.
          The energy storage device 200 is a secondary battery (battery
   cell)  capable   of   charging  and   discharging   electricity.  More
   specifically, the   energy storage device     200    is a non-aqueous
   electrolyte secondary battery such as a lithium ion secondary
15 battery.   It should be noted that the energy storage device 200 is
   not limited to a non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery.         The
   energy storage device 200 may be a secondary battery other than a
   non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery, such as a capacitor.
          As is illustrated in FIG. 5, the energy storage device 200
20 includes a container 210, the positive terminal 230, and the negative
   terminal 240.    The container 210 includes, as a top wall, a container
   lid 220.  Additionally, an electrode assembly 250, a positive current
   collector 260, and a negative current collector 270 are arranged in
   the container 210.     It should be noted that even though it is not
25 shown in the drawings, the container 210 contains a liquid such as an
   electrolyte.
          The container 210 is configured of a rectangular, tubular metal
   chassis main body having a bottom, and a container lid 220, which is
   metallic and hermetically seals the opening of the chassis main body.
30 Moreover, after insertion of the electrode assembly 250 and such, the
   inside of the container 210 is sealed by, for example, welding the
   container lid 220 to the chassis main body.     It should be noted that
   the material used for the container 210 is not particularly limited to
   a certain material, but is preferably a weldable metal such as
35 stainless steel or aluminum.
                                     - 16 -

          The electrode assembly 250 is a power generating element
   capable of storing electricity, and includes a positive electrode, a
   negative electrode, and a separator.     More specifically, the electrode
   assembly 250 is a wound electrode assembly formed by winding, into
 5 an oblong shape, a laminate including the negative electrode, the
   positive electrode, and the separator interposed therebetween.           It
   should be noted that the electrode assembly 250 may be a stacked
   electrode assembly in which flat electrode plates are layered.
          Here, the positive electrode is a long, belt-shaped positive
10 electrode base material foil made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy
   with a positive electrode active material layer formed on a surface
   thereof.   The negative electrode is a long, belt-shaped negative
   electrode base material foil made of copper or a copper alloy with a
   negative electrode active material layer formed on a surface thereof.
15 The separator is a microporous sheet.        It should be noted that the
   positive electrode, the negative electrode, and the separator used in
   the energy storage device 200 are not particularly different from
   conventional     positive   electrodes,     negative   electrodes,    and
   separators, and so long as the performance of the energy storage
20 device 200 is not inhibited, well-known materials may be used.
   Moreover, so long as it does not inhibit the performance of the energy
   storage   device   200,   the electrolyte     (non-aqueous    electrolyte)
   enclosed in the container 210 is not particular limited to a certain
   type; a variety of electrolytes may be used.
25        The positive terminal 230 is an electrode terminal that is
   electrically connected to the positive electrode in the electrode
   assembly 250 via the positive current collector 260, and the negative
   terminal 240 is an electrode terminal that is electrically connected to
   the negative electrode      in the electrode assembly 250 via the
30 negative current collector 270.      Both the positive terminal 230 and
   the negative terminal 240 are connected to the container lid 220.       In
   other words, the positive terminal 230 and the negative terminal 240
   are metallic electrode terminals for leading electricity stored in the
   electrode assembly 250 out of the energy storage device 200 and
35 introducing electricity into the energy storage device 200 to be
                                      - 17-

   stored in the electrode assembly 250.
           The positive current collector 260 is a rigid component having
   conductive properties that is electrically connected to the positive
   terminal 230 and the positive electrode, and positioned between the
 5 positive electrode of the electrode assembly 250 and a side wall of
   the container 210.     It should be noted that, similar to the positive
   electrode current collector foil of the positive electrode, the positive
   current collector 260 is made of aluminum.        Moreover, the negative
   current collector 270      is a rigid   component      having conductive
10 properties that is electrically connected to the negative terminal 240
   and the negative electrode of the electrode assembly 250, and
   positioned between the negative electrode of the electrode assembly
   250 and a side wall of the container 210. It should be noted that,
   similar to the negative electrode current collector foil of the negative
15 electrode, the negative current collector 270 is made of copper.
           Next, the configuration of the restricting component 300, the
   external wiring connection components 510 and 530, the wiring duct
   520, and the closure 540 will be described in detail.           First, the
   manner in which the external wiring connection components 510 and
20 530, the wiring duct 520, and the closure 540 are attached to the
   restricting component 300 will be described in detail.
           FIG.  6   is a   perspective   view   illustrating  the  external
   appearance of the restricting component 300 according to the
   embodiment of the present invention.        FIG. 7 is a perspective view
25 illustrating the manner in which the external wiring connection
   components 510 and 530 and the wiring duct 520 can be attached to
   the restricting component 300.
           In FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, the restricting component 300 includes
   two attachment portions 310, one on each side located along the X
30 axis.    The attachment portion 310 is a section of the restricting
   component 300 to which the external wiring connection component
   510 detachably attaches, and includes a rectangular opening 311
   and a protrusion 312 for attaching the external wiring connection
   component 510.
35         Furthermore, the external wiring connection component 530
                                      - 18 -

   and the wiring duct 520 are also detachably attachable to the
   attachment portion 310.      In other words, each of the module units
    11, 12, and 13 includes two attachment portions 310 to which the
   external wiring connection component 510, the external wiring
 5 connection component 530, and the wiring duct 520 are detachably
   attachable.   The rectangular opening 311 and the protrusion 312 for
   attaching the external wiring connection component 510 and 530 and
   the wiring duct 520 are formed on the attachment portion 310.
          Here, as is illustrated in FIG. 3, the external wiring connection
10 component 510 and 530 are detachably attached to the attachment
   portion 310 of the module units 11 and 13, which are the two
   outermost ones of the module units 11, 12, and 13. In other words,
   the external wiring connection component 510 is detachably
   attached to, out of the module units 11, 12, and 13 including the
15 attachment portion 310, the attachment portion 310 of an outermost
   one of the module units (the outermost module unit in the negative
   direction of the X axis).    Moreover, the external wiring connection
   component 530 is detachably attached to, out of the module units 11,
    12, and 13 including the attachment portion 310, the attachment
20 portion 310 of an outermost one of the module units (the outermost
   module unit in the positive direction of the X axis).
          Furthermore, out of the module units 11, 12, and 13 including
   the attachment portion 310, the wiring duct 520 is detachably
   attached to, so as to bridge, the two attachment portions 310 of
25 adjacent ones of the module units arranged inward.
          Moreover, as is illustrated in FIG. 6, the restricting component
   300 includes openings 320 formed on both sides of the attachment
   portion 310 (at the four corners of the restricting component 300).
   The opening 320 is a rectangular opening into which the external
30 positive terminal 410, the external negative terminal 420, the bus
   bar 430, or the closure 540 illustrated in FIG. 4 is inserted.
          In other words, among the openings 320 of the attachment
   portions 310 included in the module unit 11, the external positive
   terminal 410 and the external negative terminal 420 are arranged at
35 the two openings 320 in the negative direction of the X axis, and bus
                                       - 19 -

   bars 430 are arranged at the two openings 320 in the positive
   direction of the X axis.    Moreover, bus bars 430 are arranged at the
   four openings 320 of the attachment portions 310 included in the
   module unit 12.
 5        Among the openings 320 of the attachment portions 310
   included in the module unit 13, bus bars 430 are arranged at the two
   openings 320 in the negative direction of the X axis, and closures 540
   are detachably attached to the two openings 320 in the positive
   direction of the X axis to close off the two openings 320.         In other
10 words, the closure 540 is a component for closing off an opening 320
   in  which   an   external   positive terminal      410,  external  negative
   terminal 420, or bus bar 430 is not inserted, and is made of a
   material having insulating properties, such as resin.
          Next, the configuration of the external wiring            connection
15 component 510 will be described in detail.
          FIG.    8  is  a   perspective    view   illustrating  the  external
   appearance of the external          wiring   connection    component     510
   according to the embodiment of the present invention.           FIG. 9 is an
   exploded perspective view illustrating structural elements of the
20 external wiring connection component 510.
          As is illustrated in FIG. 8 and FIG. 9, the external wiring
   connection component 510 includes a main body 511, a connector
   holder 512, and connectors 513 through 515.             It should be noted
   that the external wiring connection component 510 is formed of a
25 material having insulating properties, such as resin.
          The main body 511 forms the main body of the external wiring
   connection component 510, and as is illustrated in FIG. 9, includes a
   connector holder attachment portion 511a, a guide portion 511b, and
   an engagement portion 511c.
30        The connector holder attachment portion 511a is a section of
   the main body 511 to which the connector holder 512 detachably
   attaches.    In other words, the connector holder 512 attaches to the
   main body 511 by the connector holder 512 being inserted into a
   grove formed in the connector holder attachment portion 511a.
35        The guide portion 511b is a curved section of the main body
                                       - 20 -

   511 that guides the first wiring 440 to a wiring path thereof.         In
   other words, upon connecting the first wiring 440 extending from the
   substrate 600 to the connectors 513 through 515, the first wiring 440
   is wired along the curved guide portion 511b.
 5        The engagement portion 511c is a through hole that engages
   the protrusion 312 of the attachment portion 310. In other words,
   the external wiring connection component 510 attaches to the
   attachment portion 310 of the restricting component 300 by the
   engagement portion 511c engaging the protrusion 312.
10        The connector holder 512 is for holding the connectors 513
   through 515.      More specifically, the connector holder 512 includes
   three rectangular openings 512a through 512c for insertion of the
   connectors 513 through 515.        The connector holder 512 holds the
   connectors 513 though 515 by the connectors 513 through 515 being
15 inserted into respective ones of the openings 512a through 512c.
          Each of the connectors 513 through 515 is a connector to
   which the first wiring 440 is connected.       In other words, the first
   wiring 440 and the external second wiring are connected together by
   the second wiring being connected to the connectors 513 through
20 515.   The connector 513 is, for example, an input connector for
   transmission of an electrical signal from the external second wiring
   to the first wiring 440.  The connector 514 is, for example, an output
   connector for transmission of an electrical signal from the first wiring
   440 to the external second wiring.         Each of the connectors 513
25 through 515 may have the same shape, or may have a different
   shape.
          It   should   be noted   that the external    wiring connection
   component 510 is not required to include all three connectors 513
   through     515.     For example,     the  external  wiring  connection
30 component 510 may be without the connector 515. In this case,
   since a connector is not attached to the opening 512a formed in the
   connector holder 512, the external wiring connection component 510
   may be provided with a blocking component 516 that blocks the
   opening 512a not connected with a connector.
35        Next, the configuration of the wiring duct 520 will be described
                                       - 21 -

   in detail.
          FIG.   10   is a perspective view      illustrating   the external
   appearance of the wiring duct 520 according to the embodiment of
   the present invention.
 5        The wiring duct 520 is a component that is arranged bridging
   two of the module units 11, 12, and 13, and forms a path for wiring
   passing between the two module units.        In other words, the wiring
   duct 520 detachably attaches to and bridges two adjacent ones of the
   attachment portions 310 included in two adjacent ones of the module
10 units 11, 12, and 13.
          As is illustrated in FIG. 10, the wiring duct 520 includes a
   wiring path 521 and an engagement portion 522.          It should be noted
   that the wiring duct 520 is formed of a material having insulating
   properties, such as resin.
15        The wiring path 521 is a wiring path for the first wiring 440,
   and is formed inside the wiring duct 520. In other words, the wiring
   path 521 is a straight path for guiding, to the substrate 600 disposed
   in the module unit 11, the first wiring 440 connected to the positive
   terminals 230 and the negative terminals 240 of the energy storage
20 devices 200 in the module units 12 and 13.
          The engagement portion 522 is a through hole that engages
   the protrusion 312 of the attachment portion 310. In other words,
   the external wiring duct 520 attaches to the attachment portion 310
   of the restricting component 300 by the engagement portion 522
25 engaging the protrusion 312.
          Next, the configuration of the external wiring connection
   component 530 will be described in detail.
          FIG.   11   is a perspective view      illustrating   the external
   appearance of the external       wiring   connection      component     530
30 according to the embodiment of the present invention.         FIG. 12 is an
   exploded perspective view illustrating structural elements of the
   external wiring connection component 530.
          As is illustrated in FIG. 11 and FIG. 12, the external wiring
   connection component 530 includes a main body 531 and a connector
35 532.     It should be noted that the external wiring connection
                                     - 22-

   component 530 is formed of a material having insulating properties,
   such as resin.
           The main body 531 forms the main body of the external wiring
   connection component 530, and as is illustrated in FIG. 12, includes
 5 a rectangular opening 531a into which the connector 532 is inserted.
   In other words, the main body 531 holds the connector 532 by the
   connector 532 being inserted into the opening 531a.
           Similar to the external wiring connection component 510 and
   the wiring duct 520, the main body 531 also includes an engagement
10 portion (not shown in the drawings) that is a through hole that
   engages the protrusion 312 of the attachment portion 310.      In other
   words, the external wiring connection component 530 attaches to the
   attachment portion 310 of the restricting component 300 by the
   engagement portion engaging the protrusion 312.
15         The connector 532 is connected to wiring from the substrate
   600, and, for example, connecting a cable from the external cooling
   apparatus 40 to the connector 532 makes it is possible to transmit an
   electrical signal from the substrate 600 to the cooling apparatus 40.
           It should be noted that when the energy storage apparatus 1
20 does not include the cooling apparatus 40, the external wiring
   connection component 530 is not required to include the connector
   532.    In this case, since a connector is not attached to the opening
   531a formed in the main body 531, the external wiring connection
   component 530 may be provided with a blocking component 533 that
25 blocks the opening 531a not connected with a connector.
           With this, the external wiring connection component 530
   functions as a blocking component that blocks the opening 311
   formed in the attachment portion 310 of the restricting component
   300.    In other words, in this case, the module group 10 includes the
30 external wiring connection component 530 as a blocking component
   that blocks, among the openings 311 formed in the attachment
   portions 310, an opening 311 not at which neither the external wiring
   connection component 510 nor the wiring duct 520 is attached.
           Next, an application example of the energy storage apparatus
35  1 will be given.
                                      - 23 -

           First, an example in which the energy storage apparatus 1 is
   used while housed in the energy storage pack including a plurality of
   energy     storage apparatuses.        FIG.   13 is     a perspective view
   illustrating the configuration of an energy storage pack 2 including
 5 the energy storage apparatus 1 according to the embodiment of the
   present invention.
           As is illustrated in FIG. 13, the energy storage pack 2 is a large
   power source apparatus in which a plurality of energy storage
   apparatuses (for example, ten to forty) are arranged in an array.
10 The energy storage pack 2 is a battery pack used to store energy
   and/or used as a power source, for example.            The external positive
   terminals 410 and external negative terminals 420 of adjacent ones
   of the     energy    storage   apparatuses     are   electrically connected
   together to form the high-voltage energy storage pack 2.           It should
15 be noted that the number of energy storage apparatuses included in
   the energy storage pack 2 is not particularly limited to a given
   number.
           Here, the energy storage pack 2 includes the energy storage
   apparatus 1, energy storage apparatuses la and 1b, and a pack case
20 2a that houses the energy storage apparatuses 1, la, and 1b.            The
   energy storage apparatuses la and lb are different from the energy
   storage apparatus 1.
           For example, the energy storage apparatuses la and lb are
   different from the energy storage apparatus 1 in that they do not
25 include the cooling apparatus 40.           For this reason, the external
   wiring connection components 530a and 530b included in the energy
   storage apparatuses la         and   lb are     provided    with a blocking
   component 533 as a substitute for the connector 532 illustrated in
   FIG. 12, to close the opening 311 of the attachment portion 310.
30         In other words, by configuring the external wiring connection
   component to be detachably attached, the design flexibility of the
   energy storage apparatus can be increased.               For example, this
   makes it possible to attach a temperature regulating device, such as
   the cooling apparatus 40, to a part of a given one of the energy
35 storage apparatuses.
                                        - 24 -

          Moreover, assume that the energy storage apparatuses in the
   energy storage pack 2 have a master-slave relationship, and, for
   example, the energy storage apparatus 1 is the master and the
   energy storage apparatuses la and lb are the slaves.           In other
 5 words, the external wiring connection component 510 included in the
   energy storage apparatus 1 is required to have a master connector
   and the external wiring connection components 510a and 510b
   included in the energy storage apparatuses la and lb are required to
   have slave connectors.
10        In this case, it is possible to configure the energy storage
   apparatuses by changing the shape of the connector that inserts into
   the connector holder of the external wiring connection component
   included   in   each  energy    storage    apparatus, or changing    the
   connector holder to a connector holder that holds a master or slave
15 connector.
          Then,   second wiring 50 connected to the external wiring
   connection components 510a and 510b of the energy storage
   apparatuses la      and   lb are connected      to the external   wiring
   connection component 510 of the energy storage apparatus 1,
20 thereby connecting the external second wiring 50 to the first wiring
   440 of the energy storage apparatus 1.
          In other words, in the energy storage pack 2 which includes
   the energy storage apparatus 1 and the energy storage apparatuses
    la and 1b, which are different from the energy storage apparatus 1,
25 when the external wiring connection component 510 is attached to
   the attachment portion 310, the wiring connection component 510
   connects the first wiring 440, which is connected to the wiring
   connection component 510, and the second wiring 50, which is also
   connected to the wiring connection component 510 and to the energy
30 storage apparatuses la and 1b.
          Next, an application example of the energy storage apparatus
    1 when housed in a stacked housing will be given.         FIG. 14 is a
   perspective view illustrating the configuration of a stacked housing 3
   in   which   the   energy   storage    apparatus   1 according   to  the
35 embodiment of the present invention is housed.
                                       - 25 -

          As is illustrated in FIG. 14, the stacked housing 3 is a housing
   with shelves in which the energy storage apparatus 1 is stored, and
   a connector 3a is provided on the surface in the back (in the negative
   direction of the X axis).     When the energy storage apparatus 1 is
 5 inserted into the stacked housing 3 in the negative direction of the X
   axis, the external wiring connection component 510 located on a
   short side of the energy storage apparatus 1 connects to the
   connector 3a.     With this, the first wiring 440 in the energy storage
   apparatus    1 and the external        second    wiring arranged    at the
10 connector 3a are connected.
          It should be noted that since the cooling apparatus 40 pulls in
   air from the short side of the energy storage apparatus 1 (the back
   end of the stacked        housing    3)   including the    external  wiring
   connection component 510, it is possible to efficiently cool the inside
15 of the energy storage apparatus 1.
          As described above, with the energy storage apparatus 1
   according to the embodiment of the present invention, the external
   wiring connection component 510 for connecting (i) the first wiring
   440 connected to the energy storage devices 200 and (ii)                the
20 external second wiring is configured to be detachably attached to the
   attachment portion 310.       For this reason, even if the configuration
   of the energy storage apparatus 1 is changed, it is possible to
   connect wiring designed for the configuration of the energy storage
   apparatus    1   by   changing   out    the  external   wiring  connection
25 component 510.       Moreover, when there is no need to connect wiring
   to the energy storage apparatus 1, it is possible to simplify the
   configuration of the energy storage apparatus 1 by, for example,
   removing    the    external  wiring    connection    component     510,   or
   attaching an external wiring connection component 510 to which
30 unnecessary connectors are not attached.         In this way, providing the
   detachably attachable external wiring connection component 510
   increases the design flexibility of the energy storage apparatus 1.
          Moreover, the external wiring connection component makes it
   is possible to connect together two energy storage apparatuses in
35 the energy storage pack 2.      In other words, even if the two energy
                                       - 26  -

   storage apparatuses have different configurations, it is possible to
   connect the two energy storage apparatuses together by attaching
   external    wiring    connection      components    designed   for   the
   configurations of the energy storage apparatuses, thereby increasing
 5 the design flexibility of the energy storage apparatuses.
          Moreover, the external wiring connection component 510 is
   configured    such   that   the   connector   holder  512  holding   the
   connectors 513 through 515 is detachably attachable to the main
   body 511.     Consequently, even if the configuration of the energy
10 storage apparatus 1 is changed, it is possible to connect wiring
   designed for the configuration of the energy storage apparatus 1 by
   changing out the connector holder 512.        Moreover, when there is no
   need to connect wiring to the energy storage apparatus 1, it is
   possible   to  simplify   the   configuration  of the   energy  storage
15 apparatus 1 by, for example, removing the connector holder 512, or
   attaching a connector holder 512 to which unnecessary connectors
   are not attached.     In this way, providing the detachably attachable
   connector holder 512 increases the design flexibility of the energy
   storage apparatus 1.
20        Moreover, since the main body 511 of the external wiring
   connection component 510 includes a curved guide portion 511b that
   guides the first wiring 440 to the wiring path thereof, the first wiring
   440 can be easily connected to the external wiring connection
   component 510 without bending and such.
25        Moreover, the external wiring connection component 510 is
   located on a side of the energy storage apparatus 1, which is an end
   of the energy storage apparatus 1 in the direction in which the
   positive terminal 230 and the negative terminal 240 of the energy
   storage device 200 are aligned.          Here, when the substrate 600
30 including the first wiring 440 is disposed in the space between the
   positive terminals 230 and the negative terminals 240 of the energy
   storage devices 200, the substrate 600 is not disposed at the end of
   the energy storage apparatus 1 in the above-described direction of
   alignment.    Consequently, in a configuration in which the connector
35 is provided on the substrate 600, the positive terminals 230 and the
                                       - 27 -

   negative terminals 240 are obstructive, making it difficult to connect
   the second wiring from the side (end)         of the energy storage
   apparatus    1 in   the  above-described     direction    of  alignment.
   However, by disposing the external wiring connection component 510
 5 on the side of the energy storage apparatus 1 in the above-described
   direction of alignment, the positive terminals 230 and the negative
   terminals 240 of the energy storage devices 200 are not obstructive
   even when the substrate 600 is disposed in the space between the
   positive terminals 230 and the negative terminals 240, and the
10 second wiring can be easily connected from the side of the energy
   storage apparatus 1 in the above-described direction of alignment.
   As such, even when the second wiring is arranged on the side of the
   energy storage apparatus 1 in the above-described direction of
   alignment, the second wiring can be easily connected from the side of
15 the energy storage apparatus 1 in the above-described direction of
   alignment by connecting the second wiring to the connector of the
   external wiring connection component 510.
          Moreover, since the external wiring connection component 510
   is located on a short side of the energy storage apparatus 1, when,
20 for example, the energy storage apparatus 1 is inserted into the
   stacked housing 3 including the second wiring arranged on the
   above-described    short side,   the   second   wiring    can  be easily
   connected to the external wiring connection component 510.
          Moreover, the energy storage apparatus 1 has a configuration
25 in which a blocking component (the blocking component 516, the
   blocking component 533, the external wiring connection component
   510 with the openings 512a through h512c thereof blocked, or the
   external wiring connection component 530 with the opening 531a
   blocked) is provided to block, among the plurality of openings 311,
30 an opening 311 not requiring a connector to be attached thereto.
   This makes it possible to keep foreign matter from entering the
   energy storage apparatus 1 through the opening 311. In particular,
   when the energy storage apparatus 1 is cooled by drawing air therein
   using a fan such as the cooling apparatus 40, there is concern that
35 foreign matter could be drawn in with the air, but it is possible to keep
                                     - 28 -

   foreign matter from entering with the provision of the blocking
   component.
           Moreover, since the energy storage apparatus 1 includes the
   module units 11,    12, and 13 and the external wiring connection
 5 component 510 is attached to the attachment portion 310 of the
   outermost module unit 11, the second wiring can be easily attached
   to the energy storage apparatus 1.       Additionally, it is possible to
   easily configure the energy storage apparatus 1 by lining up the
   module units 11, 12, and 13 having simple structures.
10         Moreover, since the energy storage apparatus 1 includes the
   wiring duct 520 which forms a path for wiring passing between two of
   the module units, wiring between two module units can be performed
   easily.
           Moreover, since each of the module units 11,         12, and 13
15 includes two attachment portions 310 to which the external wiring
   connection component 510 and the wiring duct 520 are detachably
   attachable, the external wiring connection component 510 and the
   wiring duct 520 can be switched out as necessary.
           Moreover, in the energy storage apparatus          1, since the
20 substrate 600 is disposed in the module unit 11 including the
   external wiring connection component 510, it is possible to shorten
   the cable connecting the connectors 513 through 515 and the
   substrate 600 by disposing the substrate 600 close to the connectors
   513 through 515.
25         Moreover, since the substrate 600 is disposed in the module
   unit 11 which is located upstream with respect to the flow of the
   coolant introduced by the cooling apparatus 40, it is possible to limit
   an increase in temperature of the substrate 600 from the heat
   generated by the energy storage devices 200 since the introduced
30 coolant comes into contact with the substrate 600.
           Hereinbefore,  the  energy    storage   apparatus     has  been
   described based on the exemplary embodiment according to the
   present invention, but the scope of the present invention is not
   limited thereto.    In other words, the embodiment disclosed is
35 merely an example in all aspects, and should not be interpreted as
                                    - 29 -

   limiting.   Equivalents of the Claims and various modifications are
   intended to be included in the exemplary embodiment which do not
   depart from the principles and spirit of the inventive concept, the
   scope of which is defined in the appended Claims and not the
 5 above-described exemplary embodiment.
           For example, in the above embodiment, the external wiring
   connection component 510 includes the connector holder 512 which
   is detachably attached to the main body 511, but the connector
   holder 512 may be fixed to the main body 511.
10         In the above embodiment, the external wiring connection
   component 510 is located on a side of the energy storage apparatus
    1, which is an end of the energy storage apparatus 1 in a direction in
   which the positive terminal 230 and the negative terminal 240 are
   aligned.    However, the external wiring connection component 510
15 may be located on a side other than this side.
           In the above embodiment, the external wiring connection
   component 510 is located on a short side of the energy storage
   apparatus 1.     However, the external wiring connection component
   510 may be located on a side other than the short surface side.
20         In the above embodiment, the external wiring connection
   component 510 is provided on an outermost one of the plurality of
   module units.     However, the external wiring connection component
   510 may be provided on an inner one of the plurality of module units.
           In the above embodiment, the restricting components 300 of
25 the module units 11, 12, and 13 include attachment portions 310 to
   which the external wiring connection components 510 and 530 and
   the wiring duct 520 are detachably attachable, but this configuration
   is not limiting.    For example, the restricting component 300 of
   module unit 11 may include an attachment portion to which only the
30 external wiring connection component 510 is detachably attachable
   and an attachment portion to which only the wiring duct 520 is
   detachably attachable.
           In the above embodiment, substrate 600 is disposed in,
   among the plurality of module units, a module unit provided with the
35 external wiring connection component 510.      However, the substrate
                                     - 30 -

   600 may be disposed in a module unit that is not provided with the
   external wiring connection component 510.
           In the above embodiment, substrate 600 is disposed in,
   among the plurality of module units, a module unit located upstream
 5 with respect to the flow of the coolant.   However, the substrate 600
   may be disposed in a module unit located downstream with respect to
   the flow of the coolant.
           In the above embodiment, the energy storage apparatus 1
   includes the cooling apparatus 40, but the energy storage apparatus
10  1 may have a configuration which does not include the cooling
   apparatus 40.
          Throughout this specification and the claims which follow,
   unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and
   variations such as "comprises" and "comprising", will be understood
15 to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers
   or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of
   integers or steps.
          The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and
   should not be taken as, an acknowledgement or any form of
20 suggestion that the prior art forms part of the common general
   knowledge in Australia.
