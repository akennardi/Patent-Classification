DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0027]      An example architectural opening covering assembly disclosed herein may be
controlled by a controller. In some examples, the example architectural opening covering
assembly includes a motor and gravitational sensor communicatively coupled to the controller.
The motor rotates a tube about which a covering is at least partially wound. Thus, if the motor
rotates the tube, the covering is raised or lowered.
[0028]      In some examples, the gravitational sensor generates tube position information
and/or determines an angular position of the tube based on gravity (e.g., determining an
angular position relative to a gravitational field vector of Earth). In some examples, by
determining a number of rotations of the tube from a predetermined position (e.g., a fully
unwound position, a fully wound position, etc.), the position of the covering is determined.
[0029]      In some examples, the gravitational sensor is an accelerometer (e.g., a capacitive
accelerometer, a piezoelectric accelerometer, a piezoresistive accelerometer, a Hall Effect
accelerometer, a magnetoresistive accelerometer, a heat transfer accelerometer and/or any
other suitable type of accelerometer). Other examples employ other types of gravitational
sensors such as, for example, a tilt sensor, a level sensor, a gyroscope, an eccentric weight
(e.g., a pendulum) movably coupled to a rotary encoder, an inclinometer, and/or any other
suitable gravitational sensor.
[0030]      In some examples, the gravitational sensor is used to determine if a manual input
(e.g., a force such as a pull applied to the covering or any other part of the assembly) is
provided. In some instances, in response to the manual input, the example controller controls
the motor to move the covering, stop movement of the covering, and/or counter the manual
input to prevent lowering or raising the covering past a threshold position such as, for example,
a lower limit position or an upper limit position.
[0031]      FIG. 1 is an isometric illustration of an example architectural opening covering
assembly 100. In the example of FIG. 1, the covering assembly 100 includes a headrail 108.
The headrail 108 is a housing having opposed end caps 110, 111 joined by front 112, back
113 and top sides 114 to form an open bottom enclosure. The headrail 108 also has mounts
115 for coupling the headrail 108 to a structure above an architectural opening such as a wall

                                                 -9
via mechanical fasteners such as screws, bolts, etc. A roller tube 104 is disposed between the
end caps 110, 111. Although a particular example of a headrail 108 is shown in FIG. 1, many
different types and styles of headrails exist and could be employed in place of the example
headrail 108 of FIG. 1. Indeed, if the aesthetic effect of the headrail 108 is not desired, it can
be eliminated in favor of mounting brackets.
[0032]      In the example illustrated in FIG. 1, the architectural opening covering assembly 100
includes a covering 106, which is a cellular type of shade. In this example, the cellular covering
106 includes a unitary flexible fabric (referred to herein as a "backplane") 116 and a plurality of
cell sheets 118 that are secured to the backplane 116 to form a series of cells. The cell sheets
118 may be secured to the backplane 116 using any desired fastening approach such as
adhesive attachment, sonic welding, weaving, stitching, etc. The covering 106 shown in FIG. 1
can be replaced by any other type of covering including, for instance, single sheet shades,
blinds, other cellular coverings, and/or any other type of covering. In the illustrated example,
the covering 106 has an upper edge mounted to the roller tube 104 and a lower, free edge.
The upper edge of the example covering 106 is coupled to the roller tube 104 via a chemical
fastener (e.g., glue) and/or one or more mechanical fasteners (e.g., rivets, tape, staples, tacks,
etc.). The covering 106 is movable between a raised position and a lowered position
(illustratively, the position shown in FIG. 1). When in the raised position, the covering 106 is
wound about the roller tube 104.
[0033]      The example architectural opening covering assembly 100 is provided with a motor
120 to move the covering 106 between the raised and lowered positions. The example motor
120 is controlled by a controller 122. In the illustrated example, the controller 122 and the
motor 120 are disposed inside the tube 104 and communicatively coupled via a wire 124.
Alternatively, the controller 122 and/or the motor 120 may be disposed outside of the tube 104
(e.g., mounted to the headrail 108, mounted to the mounts 115, located in a central facility
location, etc.) and/or communicatively coupled via a wireless communication channel.
[0034]      The example architectural opening covering assembly 100 of FIG. 1 includes a
gravitational sensor 126 (e.g., the gravitational sensor made by Kionixo as part number
KXTC9-2050) communicatively coupled to the controller 122. The example gravitational sensor
126 of FIG. 1 is coupled to the tube 104 via a mount 128 to rotate with the tube 104. In the
illustrated example, the gravitational sensor 126 is disposed inside the tube 104 along an axis
of rotation 130 of the tube 104 such that an axis of rotation of the gravitational sensor 126 is
substantially coaxial to the axis of rotation 130 of the tube 104. In the illustrated example, a

                                                 -10
central axis of the tube 104 is substantially coaxial to the axis of rotation 130 of the tube 104,
and a center of the gravitational sensor 126 is on (e.g., substantially coincident with) the axis of
rotation 130 of the tube 104. In other examples, the gravitational sensor 126 is disposed in
other locations such as, for example, on an interior surface 132 of the tube 104, on an exterior
surface 134 of the tube 104, on an end 136 of the tube 104, on the covering 106, and/or any
other suitable location. As described in greater detail below, the example gravitational sensor
126 generates tube position information, which is used by the controller 122 to determine an
angular position of the tube 104 and/or monitor movement of the tube 104 and, thus, the
covering 106.
[0035]     In some examples, the architectural opening covering assembly 100 is operatively
coupled to an input device 138, which may be used to selectively move the covering 106
between the raised and lowered positions. In some examples, the input device 138 sends a
signal to the controller 122 to enter a programming mode in which one or more positions (e.g.,
a lower limit position, an upper limit position, a position between the lower limit position and the
upper limit position, etc.) are determined and/or recorded. In the case of an electronic signal,
the signal may be sent via a wired or wireless connection.
[0036]     In some examples, the input device 138 is a mechanical input device such as, for
example, a cord, a lever, a crank, and/or an actuator coupled to the motor 120 and/or the tube
104 to apply a force to the tube 104 to rotate the tube 104. In some examples, the input device
128 is implemented by the covering 106 and, thus, the input device 138 is eliminated. In some
examples, the input device 138 is an electronic input device such as, for example, a switch, a
light sensor, a computer, a central controller, a smartphone, and/or any other device capable
of providing instructions to the motor 120 and/or the controller 122 to raise or lower the
covering 106. In some examples, the input device 138 is a remote control, a smart phone, a
laptop, and/or any other portable communication device, and the controller 122 includes a
receiver to receive signals from the input device 138. Some example architectural opening
covering assemblies include other numbers of input devices (e.g., 0, 2, etc.). The example
architectural opening covering assembly 100 may include any number and combination of
input devices.
[0037]     FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of the example tube 104 of FIG. 1. In the illustrated
example, the tube 104 is coupled to the end cap 111 and/or the mount 115 via a slip ring 200.
In some examples, a power source provides power to the input device 138, the motor 120, the
controller 122, and/or other components of the architectural opening covering assembly 100

                                                 - 11
via the slip ring 200. A housing 202 is disposed inside the example tube 104 of FIG. 2 to rotate
with the tube 104. In the illustrated example, the mount 128 is disposed inside the housing 202
and is coupled to the housing 202. The example mount 128 of FIG. 2 is a circuit board (e.g., a
printed circuit board (PCB)) onto which components of the controller 122 are coupled. Thus, in
the illustrated example, the controller 122 and the gravitational sensor 126 rotate with the tube
104.
[0038]      As mentioned above, the example gravitational sensor 126 is coupled to the mount
128 such that an axis of rotation of the gravitational sensor 126 is substantially coaxial to the
axis of rotation 130 of the tube 104, which is substantially coaxial to a central axis of the tube.
In the illustrated example, the center of the gravitational sensor 126 is disposed on (e.g.,
substantially coincident with) the axis of rotation 130 of the tube 104. As a result, when the
tube 104 rotates about the axis of rotation 130, the gravitational sensor 126 is subjected to a
substantially constant gravitational force (g-force) of about 1 g (i.e., the gravitational sensor
126 does not substantially move up and down relative to Earth). In other examples, the
gravitational sensor 126 is disposed in other positions and experiences variable g-forces as
the tube 104 rotates. As described below, the g-force provides a frame of reference
independent of the angular position of the tube 104 from which the rotation and, thereby, an
angular position of the tube 104 can be determined.
[0039]      In the illustrated example, the gravitational sensor 126 is an accelerometer (e.g., a
capacitive accelerometer, a piezoelectric accelerometer, a piezoresistive accelerometer, a Hall
Effect accelerometer, a magnetoresistive accelerometer, a heat transfer accelerometer and/or
any other suitable type of accelerometer). Alternatively, the gravitational sensor 126 may be
any other type of gravitational sensor such as, for example, a tilt sensor, a level sensor, a
gyroscope, an eccentric weight (e.g., a pendulum) movably coupled to a rotary encoder, an
inclinometer, and/or any other suitable gravitational sensor.
[0040]      Alternatively, any other sensor that determines the angular position of the tube 104
relative to one or more frame(s) of references that are independent of (e.g., substantially fixed
or constant relative to) the angular position of the tube 104 may be utilized. For example, a
sensor that generates tube position information based a magnetic field imparted by one or
more magnets disposed outside of the tube 104 (e.g., on a wall, bracket, etc. adjacent the tube
104) may be employed by the example architectural opening covering assembly 100. Similarly,
a sensor may generate tube position information based on a radio frequency (RF) signal
transmitted from outside of the tube 104 (e.g., by detecting a strength of the RF signal, which

                                                -12
may vary depending on the angular position of the sensor in and/or on the tube 104 relative to
a RF signal transmitter, and so forth.
[0041]      FIGS. 15A-C illustrate the example tube 104 and the example gravitational sensor
126 oriented in various angular positions. In the illustrated example, the gravitational sensor
126 is a dual-axis gravitational sensor. Thus, the gravitational sensor 126 generates tube
position information based on an orientation of a first axis 1500 and a second axis 1502 of the
gravitational sensor 126 relative to a direction of gravitational force, which is illustrated in
FIGS. 15A-C as a gravitational vector of Earth 1504. In the illustrated example, the axis of
rotation 130 of the tube 104 runs perpendicular to the plane in which FIGS. 15A-C are drawn.
The example first axis 1500 and the example second axis 1502 of FIGS. 15A-C are
perpendicular to each other and the axis of rotation 130 of the tube 104. As a result, when the
first axis 1500 is aligned with the gravitational field vector of Earth 1504, as illustrated in FIG.
15A, the second axis 1502 is perpendicular to the gravitational field vector of Earth 1504.
Alternatively, the gravitational sensor 126 may be a tri-axial gravitational sensor and/or any
other type of gravitational sensor.
[0042]      The gravitational sensor 126 of the illustrated example generates tube position
information and transmits the tube position information to the controller 122. The example
gravitational sensor 126 outputs a first signal associated with the first axis 1500 and a second
signal associated with the second axis 1502. The first signal includes a first value (e.g., a
voltage) corresponding to a g-force experienced by the gravitational sensor 126 along the first
axis 1500. The second signal includes a second value (e.g., a voltage) corresponding to a g
force experienced by the gravitational sensor 126 along the second axis 1502. Thus, the tube
position information generated by the example gravitational sensor 126 includes the first value
and the second value, which are based on the orientation of the gravitational sensor 126. In
the illustrated example, the gravitational sensor 126 substantially constantly outputs the first
signal and/or the second signal. In some examples, the gravitational sensor 126 outputs the
first signal and the second signal according to a schedule (e.g., the gravitational sensor 126
outputs the first signal and/or the second signal every one one-hundredth of a second
irrespective of the detection of movement, etc.).
[0043]      Each angular position of the gravitational sensor 126 and, thus, the tube 104
corresponds to a different first value and/or second value. Thus, the first value and/or the
second value are indicative of an angular displacement of the gravitational sensor 126 relative
to the gravitational field vector of Earth 1504. A combination of the first value and the second

                                                 -13
value is indicative of a direction of the angular displacement (e.g., clockwise or
counterclockwise) of the example gravitational sensor 126 relative to the gravitational vector of
Earth 1504. As a result, based on the first value and the second value, an angular position
(i.e., the amount of angular displacement in a given direction relative to the gravitational vector
of Earth 1504) of the tube 104 may be determined. A change in the first value and/or the
second value is indicative of motion (i.e., rotation) of the tube 104. Thus, a rate of change of
the first value and/or the second value is indicative of a speed of rotation of the tube 104, and
a rate of change of the speed of rotation of the tube 104 indicates an angular acceleration of
the tube 104.
[0044]      In the illustrated example of FIG. 15A, the gravitational sensor 126 is in a first
angular position such that the first axis 1500 is aligned with the gravitational field vector 1504
and pointing in an opposite direction of the gravitational field vector 1504. As a result, the
example gravitational sensor 126 outputs a first value corresponding to positive 1 g. In the
illustrated example of FIG. 15A, the second axis 1502 is perpendicular to the gravitational field
vector 1502 and, thus, the gravitational sensor 126 outputs a second value corresponding to
zero g.
[0045]      In the illustrated example of FIG. 15B, the gravitational sensor is in a second angular
position such that the gravitational sensor 126 is rotated about 30 degrees counterclockwise in
the orientation of FIG. 15B from the first angular position. The first value and the second value
output by the example gravitational sensor 126 are sinusoidal functions of the angular position
of the gravitational sensor 126 relative to the gravitational vector of Earth 1504. Thus, in the
illustrated example, one or more trigonometric functions may be used to determine the angular
position of the gravitational sensor 126 based on the first value and the second value. In the
illustrated example of FIG. 15B, when the gravitational sensor 126 is in the second position,
the gravitational sensor 126 outputs the first value indicative of 0.866 g (0.866 g = 1 g x sin(60
degrees)) and the second value indicative of about 0.5 g (0.5 g = 1 g x sin(30 degrees). Thus,
an inverse tangent of the g-force indicated by the first value over the g-force indicated by the
second value indicates that the second angular position of the gravitational sensor 126 and,
thus, the tube 104 is thirty degrees counterclockwise from the first angular position.
[0046]      In FIG. 15C, the tube 104 is in a third angular position at which the tube 104 is
rotated thirty degrees clockwise in the orientation of FIG. 15C from the first angular position.
As a result, the first value indicates a g-force of positive 0.866 g and the second value
indicates a g-force of negative 0.5 g. Thus, the inverse tangent of the g-force indicated by the

                                                -14
first value over the g-force indicated by the second value indicates that the tube 104 is rotated
thirty degrees clockwise from the first angular position.
[0047]     As the tube 104 and, thus, the gravitational sensor 126 rotate about the axis of
rotation 130, the first value and the second value of the first signal and the second signal,
respectively, change according to the orientation (e.g., angular position) of the gravitational
sensor 126. Thus, rotation of the tube 104 may be determined by detecting a change in the
first value and/or the second value. Further, the angular displacement (i.e., amount of rotation)
of the tube 104 may be determined based on the amount of change of the first value and/or the
second value.
[0048]     The direction of the angular displacement may be determined based on how the first
value and/or the second value change (e.g., increase and/or decrease). For example, if the
gforce experienced along the first axis decrease and the g-force experienced along the second
axis decrease, the tube 104 is rotating counterclockwise in the orientation of FIG. 1. While
particular units and directions are disclosed as examples herein, any units and/or directions
may be utilized. For example, an orientation that results in a positive value in an example
disclosed herein may alternatively result in a negative value in a different example.
[0049]     A revolution of the tube 104 may be determined and/or incremented by detecting a
repetition of a combination of the first value and the second value during rotation of the tube
104. For example, if the tube 104 is rotating in one direction and a given combination of the
first value and the second value repeat (e.g., a combination indicative of 1 g and 0 g for the
first value and the second value, respectively), the tube 104 rotated one revolution from the
angular position at which the combination of the first and second value corresponds (e.g., the
first angular position).
[0050]      In some examples, a rotational speed of the tube 104 is determined based on a rate
of change of the angular position of the gravitational sensor 126. In some examples, the
controller 122 determines the angular position of the tube 104, the rotational speed of the tube
104, the direction of rotation of the tube 104 and/or other information based on the tube
position information generated by the gravitational sensor 126. In other examples, the tube
position information includes the angular position of the tube 104, the rotational speed of the
tube 104, and/or other information.

                                              -15
[0051]     Based on the angular displacement (e.g., a number of revolutions) of the tube 104
from a reference position of the covering 106 (e.g., a previously stored position, a fully
unwound position, a lower limit position, an upper limit position, etc.), a position of the covering
106 may be determined, monitored and/or recorded.
[0052]     During operation of the example architectural opening covering assembly 100, the
example gravitational sensor 126 transmits tube position information to the controller 122. In
some examples, the controller 122 receives a command from the input device 138 to move the
covering 106 in a commanded direction (e.g., to raise the covering 106, to lower the covering
106, etc.) and/or move the covering 106 to a commanded position (e.g., a lower limit position,
an upper limit position, etc.). In some examples, based on the tube position information, the
controller 122 determines a direction in which the tube 104 is to be rotated to move the
covering 106 in the commanded direction, a number of (and/or a fraction of) revolutions of the
tube 106 to move the covering 106 from its current position to the commanded position, and/or
other information. The example controller 122 then transmits a signal to the motor 120 to rotate
the tube 104 in accordance with the command. As the motor 120 rotates the tube 104 and
winds or unwinds the covering 106, the gravitational sensor 126 transmits tube position
information to the controller 122, and the controller 122 determines, monitors and/or stores the
position of the covering 106, the number of revolutions of the tube 104 (which may be whole
numbers and/or fractions) away from the commanded position and/or a reference position,
and/or other information. Thus, the controller 122 controls the position of the covering 106
based on the tube position information generated by the example gravitational sensor 126.
[0053]     In some examples, the user provides a user input that causes the tube 104 to rotate
or rotate at a speed greater than or less than one or more thresholds of rotational speed of the
tube 104 expected via operation of the motor 120 (e.g., by pulling on the covering 106, twisting
the tube 104, etc.). In some examples, based on the tube position information generated by
the example gravitational sensor 126, the controller 122 monitors movement of the tube 104
and detects the user input (e.g., based on detecting movement of the tube 104 (e.g., a rock
and/or rotation, an angular acceleration, a deceleration ,etc.) when the motor 120 is not being
operated to move the tube 104). When the user input is detected, the controller 122 may
operate the motor 120 (e.g., to counter or assist rotation of the tube 104).
[0054]     FIG. 3 is a block diagram of another example architectural opening covering
assembly 300 disclosed herein. In the illustrated example, the architectural opening covering
assembly 300 includes a tube 302, a gravitational sensor 304, a transmitter 306, a controller

                                                 -16
308, a first input device 310, a second input device 312 and a motor 314. In the illustrated
example, the gravitational sensor 304, the transmitter 306 and the motor 314 are disposed
inside the tube 302. The example controller 308 of FIG. 3 is disposed outside of the tube 302
(e.g., in a control box adjacent an architectural opening). In the illustrated example, the first
input device 310 is a mechanical input device (e.g., a cord (e.g., a loop) drivable actuator)
operatively coupled to the tube 302. The example second input device 312 is an electronic
input device (e.g., a remote control) communicatively coupled to the controller 308. During
operation of the example architectural opening covering assembly 300, the gravitational sensor
304 generates tube position information, and the transmitter 306 transmits the tube position
information to the controller 308 (e.g., wirelessly, via a wire, etc.). The example controller 308
utilizes the tube position information to monitor a position of the tube 302 and operate the
motor 314.
[0055]      FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example controller 400 disclosed herein, which may
implement the example controller 122 of FIGS. 1-2 and/or the example controller 308 of FIG.
3. Although the example controller 400 of FIG. 4 is described below in conjunction with the
example architectural opening covering assembly 100 of FIGS. 1-2, the example controller 400
may be employed as the controller of other examples such as the controller 308 of the
architectural opening covering assembly 300 of FIG. 3.
[0056]      In the illustrated example, the controller 400 includes an angular position determiner
402, a rotational direction determiner 404, a covering position determiner 406, an instruction
processor 408, a memory 410 and a motor controller 412. During operation of the controller
400, the gravitational sensor 126 generates tube position information (e.g., voltages
corresponding to g-forces experienced along dual axes of the gravitational sensor 126). The
tube position information is transmitted to the angular position determiner 402 and/or the
rotational direction determiner 404 (e.g., via a wire). In the illustrated example, the angular
position determiner 402 processes the tube position information and/or determines an angular
position of the tube 104 (e.g., relative to a gravitational field vector of Earth) based on the tube
position information.
[0057]      The example rotational direction determiner 404 of FIG. 4 determines a direction of
rotation of the tube 104 such as, for example, clockwise or counterclockwise based on the
angular positions of the tube 104 and/or the tube position information. In the illustrated
example, the rotational direction determiner 404 determines the direction of rotation based on
how the first value and/or the second value outputted by the example gravitational sensor 126

                                                 -17
changes as the tube 104 rotates. The example the rotational direction determiner 404
associates the direction of rotation of the tube 104 with raising or lowering the example
covering 106. For example, during initial setup, after a disconnection of power, etc., the
rotational direction determiner 404 associates the direction of rotation of the tube 104 with
raising or lowering the example covering 106 based on a first voltage supplied to the motor
120 to rotate the tube 104 in a first direction and a second voltage supplied to the motor 120 to
rotate the tube 104 in a second direction (e.g., if the first voltage is greater than the second
voltage and, thus, a first load on the motor to rotate the tube 104 in the first direction is greater
than a second load on the motor to rotate the tube 104 in the second direction, the first voltage
is associated with raising the covering 106).
[0058]     In some examples, the example instruction processor 408 may receive instructions
via the input device 138 to raise or lower the covering 106. In some examples, in response to
receiving the instructions, the instruction processor 408 determines a direction of rotation of
the tube 104 to move the covering 106 to a commanded position and/or an amount of rotation
of the tube 104 to move the covering 106 to the commanded position. In the illustrated
example, the instruction processor 408 sends instructions to the motor controller 412 to
operate the motor 120.
[0059]     The example memory 410 of FIG. 4 organizes and/or stores information such as, for
example, a position of the covering 106, a direction of rotation of the tube 104 to raise the
covering 106, a direction of rotation of the tube 104 to lower the covering 106, one or more
reference positions of the covering 106 (e.g., a fully unwound position, an upper limit position,
a lower limit position, etc.), and/or any other information that may be utilized during the
operation of the architectural opening covering assembly 100.
[0060]     The example motor controller 412 sends signals to the motor 120 to cause the motor
120 to operate the covering 106 (e.g., lower the covering 106, raise the covering 106, and/or
prevent (e.g., brake, stop, etc.) movement of the covering 106, etc.). The example motor
controller 412 of FIG. 4 is responsive to instructions from the instruction processor 408. The
motor controller 412 may include a motor control system, a speed controller (e.g., a pulse
width modulation speed controller), a brake, or any other component for operating the motor
120. In some examples, the example motor controller 412 of FIG. 4 controls a supply of the
voltage (e.g., corresponding to power) to the motor 120 to regulate the speed of the motor 120.

                                               -18
[0061]      The example covering position determiner 406 of FIG. 4 determines a position of the
covering 106 relative to a reference position such as, for example, a previously stored position,
a fully unwound position, a lower limit position, an upper limit position and/or any other
reference position. To determine the position of the covering 106, the example covering
position determiner 406 determines an angular displacement (i.e., an amount of rotation) of the
tube 104 from a given position such as, for example, a previously stored position and/or any
other position, and the covering position determiner 406 increments a number of revolutions of
the tube 104 from the reference position. The covering position determiner 406 may adjust a
stored position of the covering 106. In some examples, the covering position determiner 406
determines the position of the covering 106 in units of degrees of tube rotation relative to the
reference position (e.g., based on the angular position of the tube 104 determined via the
angular position determiner 402 and the direction of rotation of the tube 104 determined via the
rotational direction determiner 404) and/or any other unit of measurement.
[0062]      While an example manner of implementing the controller 400 has been illustrated in
FIG. 4, one or more of the elements, processes and/or devices illustrated in FIG. 4 may be
combined, divided, re-arranged, omitted, eliminated and/or implemented in any other way.
Further, the example gravitational sensor 126, angular position determiner 402, rotational
direction determiner 404, covering position determiner 406, instruction processor 408, motor
controller 412, input device 138, memory 410, and/or the example controller 400 of FIG. 4 may
be implemented by hardware, software, firmware and/or any combination of hardware,
software and/or firmware. Thus, for example, any of the example gravitational sensor 126,
angular position determiner 402, rotational direction determiner 404, covering position
determiner 406, instruction processor 408, motor controller 412, input device 138, memory
410, and/or the example controller 400 of FIG. 4 could be implemented by one or more
circuit(s), programmable processor(s), application specific integrated circuit(s) (ASIC(s)),
programmable logic device(s) (PLD(s)) and/or field programmable logic device(s) (FPLD(s)),
etc. When any of the apparatus or system claims of this patent are read to cover a purely
software and/or firmware implementation, at least one of the example gravitational sensor 126,
angular position determiner 402, rotational direction determiner 404, covering position
determiner 406, instruction processor 408, motor controller 412, input device 138, memory
410, and/or the example controller 400 of FIG. 4 are hereby expressly defined to include a
tangible computer readable medium such as a memory, DVD, CD, Blu-ray, etc. storing the
software and/or firmware. Further still, the example controller 400 of FIG. 4 may include one or
more elements, processes and/or devices in addition to, or instead of, those illustrated in FIG.

                                                 -19

devices.
[0063]      FIG. 5 is a block diagram of another example controller 500 disclosed herein, which
may be used to implement the example controller 100 of FIGS. 1-2 and/or the example
controller 308 of FIG. 3. Thus, although the example controller 500 of FIG. 5 is described
below in conjunction with the example architectural opening covering assembly 100 of FIGS.
1-2, the example controller 500 may be employed as the controller 308 of the architectural
opening covering assembly 300 of FIG. 3 and/or as a controller from another type of covering
assembly. Thus, the gravitational sensor 126 and/or any other components of the example
controller 500 may be disposed inside a tube or outside the tube, etc.,
[0064]      In the illustrated example, the controller 500 includes a voltage rectifier 501, a
polarity sensor 502, a clock or timer 504, a signal instruction processor 506, the gravitational
sensor 126, a tube rotational speed determiner 508, a rotational direction determiner 510, a
fully unwound position determiner 512, a covering position monitor 514, a programming
processor 516, a manual instruction processor 518, a local instruction receiver 520, a current
sensor 522, a motor controller 524, and an information storage device or memory 526.
[0065]      During operation, the example polarity sensor 502 determines a polarity (e.g.,
positive or negative) of a voltage source (e.g., a power supply) supplied to the controller 500.
As described in further detail herein, the voltage source may be the input device 138 and/or
may be provided via the input device 138. In some examples, the voltage source is
conventional power supplied via a house wall and/or a building. In other examples, the voltage
source is a battery. In the illustrated example, the input device 138 modulates (e.g., alternates)
the polarity of the power supplied to the controller 500 to signal commands or instructions
(e.g., lower the covering 106, raise the covering 106, move the covering 106 to position X, etc.)
to the controller 500. The example polarity sensor 502 receives timing information from the
clock 504 to determine the duration of modulations of the polarity of the voltage (e.g., to
determine that the polarity was switched from negative to positive, and held positive for 0.75
seconds indicating that the covering 106 should be moved to 75% lowered). Thus, the
illustrated example employs pulse width modulation to convey commands. The example
polarity sensor 502 of the illustrated example provides polarity information to the rotational
direction determiner 510, the memory 526, and the motor controller 524.

                                                 -20
[0066]     The voltage rectifier 501 of the illustrated example converts the signal transmitted by
the input device 138 to a direct current signal of a predetermined polarity. This direct current
signal is provided to any of the components of the controller 500 that are powered (e.g., the
programming instruction processor 516, the memory 526, the motor controller 524, etc.).
Accordingly, modulating the polarity of the power signal to provide instructions to the controller
500 will not interfere with the operation of components that utilize a direct current signal for
operation. Although the illustrated example modulates the polarity of the power signal, some
examples modulate the amplitude of the signal.
[0067]     The example clock or timer 504 provides timing information using, for example, a
real-time clock. The clock 504 may provide information based on the time of day and/or may
provide a running timer not based on the time of day (e.g., for determining an amount of time
that has elapsed in a given period). In some examples, the clock 504 is used to determine a
time of day at which a manual input occurred. In other examples, the clock 504 is used to
determine an amount of time elapsed without a manual input. In other examples, the clock 504
is used by the polarity sensor 502 to determine a duration of a modulation (e.g., polarity
change).
[0068]     The example signal instruction processor 506 determines which of a plurality of
actions are instructed by the signal transmitted from the input device 138 to the example
controller 500. For example, the signal instruction processor 506 may determine, via the
polarity sensor 502, that a modulation of the input power (e.g., a signal having two polarity
changes (e.g., positive to negative and back to positive) within one second) corresponds to a
command to raise the example covering 106.
[0069]     The example tube rotational speed determiner 508 determines a speed of rotation of
the tube 104 using tube position information from the gravitational sensor 126. Information
from the tube rotational speed determiner 508 facilitates a determination that a manual input is
provided to the example architectural opening covering assembly 100. For example, when the
motor 120 is operating and the tube 104 is moving faster or slower than the speed at which the
motor 120 is driving the tube 104, the speed difference is assumed to be caused by a manual
input (e.g., a user pulling on the covering 106).
[0070]     The fully unwound position determiner 512 determines a position of the covering 106
where the covering 106 is fully unwound from the tube 104. In some examples, the fully
unwound position determiner 512 determines the fully unwound position based on movement

                                                -21
of the tube 104 as described in further detail below. Because the fully unwound position will not
change for the covering 106 (e.g., unless the covering 106 is physically modified or an
obstruction is present) the fully unwound position is a reference that can be used by the
controller 500. In other words, once the fully unwound position is known, other positions of the
covering 106 can be referenced to that fully unwound position (e.g., the number of rotations of
the tube 104 from the fully unwound position to a desired position). If the current position of the
covering 106 is later unavailable (e.g., after a power loss, after the architectural opening
covering assembly 100 is removed and reinstalled, etc.), the controller 500 can move the
covering 106 to a desired position by moving the covering 106 to the fully unwound position as
determined by the fully unwound position determiner 512 and then rotating the tube 104 the
known number of rotations to reach the desired position of the covering 106.
[0071]     The example covering position monitor 514 of FIG. 5 determines positions of the
covering 106 during operation via the example gravitational sensor 126. In some examples,
the position of the covering 106 is determined based on a number of rotations of the tube 104
relative to the fully unwound position. In some examples, the position of the covering 106 is
determined in units (e.g., fractions) of revolutions and/or degrees or rotation (e.g., relative to
the fully unwound position).
[0072]     The example rotational direction determiner 510 of FIG. 5 determines a direction of
rotation of the tube 104 such as, for example, clockwise or counterclockwise via the
gravitational sensor 126. In some examples, the rotational direction determiner 510 associates
the direction of rotation of the tube 104 with raising or lowering the example covering 106. For
example, during initial setup, after a disconnection of power, etc., the rotational direction
determiner 510 may determine the direction of rotation of the tube 104 by operating the
example motor 120 using the supplied voltage.
[0073]     The example current sensor 522 of FIG. 5 determines an amperage of a current
supplied to drive the example motor 120. During operation, a first amperage provided to drive
the motor 120 to raise the covering 106 is greater than a second amperage provided to drive
the motor 120 to lower the covering 106 or to enable the covering 106 to lower. Accordingly,
the current sensed by the current sensor 522 is used by the rotational direction determiner 510
to determine the direction of rotation of the tube 104.
[0074]     The example manual instruction processor 518 of FIG. 5 monitors the architectural
opening covering assembly 100 for manual inputs such as, for example, rotation of the tube

                                                 - 22
104 caused by and/or affected by the covering 106 contacting an obstruction, the covering 106
being pulled, the input device providing a force to the tube, etc. The example manual
instruction processor 518 determines that the manual input is being provided when rotation of
the tube 104 is sensed by the gravitational sensor 126 while the motor 120 is not operated by
the motor controller 524 and/or the speed of rotation of the tube 104 as sensed by the tube
rotational speed determiner 508 is greater than or less than thresholds of rotational speed of
the tube 104 expected via operation of the motor 120 by the motor controller 524. The manual
instruction processor 518 of the illustrated example also determines if the manual input is a
command (e.g., a command to stop or move the covering 106, or any other command).
Detection of commands is described in further detail below.
[0075]     In some examples, the example local instruction receiver 520 receives signals (e.g.,
a RF signal) from the input device 138. In some examples, the signals correspond to an action
such as, for example, raising or lowering the covering 106. After receiving the signals from the
input device 138, the example local instruction receiver 520 instructs the motor controller 524
to move the covering 106 based on the client action corresponding to the signals.
[0076]     The example programming processor 516 of FIG. 5 enters a programming mode in
response to a command from the input device. The example programming processor 516
determines and records positions of the covering 106 such as, for example, a lower limit
position, an upper limit position, and/or any other desired position entered by a user (e.g., via
the input device). The programming processor 516 stores position information in the memory
526.
[0077]     The example information storage device or memory 526 stores (a) rotational
direction associations with polarity and operation of the motor 120, (b) commands or
instructions and their associated signal patterns (e.g., polarity switches), (c) covering positions
(e.g., current positions, preset positions, etc.), (d) amperages associated with operation of the
motor 120, and/or (e) any other information.
[0078]     The example motor controller 524 of FIG. 5 sends signals to the motor 120 to cause
the motor 120 to operate the covering 106 (e.g., lower the covering 106, raise the covering
106, and/or prevent (e.g., brake, stop, etc.) movement of the covering 106, etc.). The example
motor controller 524 of FIG. 5 is responsive to instructions from the signal instruction processor
506, the local instruction receiver 520, the fully unwound position determiner 512, and/or the
programming processor 516. The motor controller 524 may include a motor control system, a

                                                -23
speed controller (e.g., a pulse width modulation speed controller), a brake, or any other
component for operating the motor 120. The example motor controller 524 of FIG. 5 controls
the supply of the voltage (i.e., power) provided by the voltage rectifier 501 to the motor 120 to
regulate the speed of the motor 120).
[0079]      While an example manner of implementing the controller 500 has been illustrated in
FIG. 5, one or more of the elements, processes and/or devices illustrated in FIG. 5 may be

executed to implement the example controller 122 of FIG. 1, the example controller 308 of FIG.
3, example controller 400 of FIG. 4 and/or the example controller 500 of FIG. 5 are shown in
FIGS. 6-13. In these examples, the machine readable instructions comprise a program for
execution by a processor such as the processor 1412 shown in the example processor
platform 1400 discussed below in connection with FIG. 14. The program may be embodied in
software stored on a tangible computer readable medium such as a CD-ROM, a floppy disk, a
hard drive, a digital versatile disk (DVD), a Blu-ray disk, or a memory associated with the
processor 1412, but the entire program and/or parts thereof could alternatively be executed by
a device other than the processor 1412 and/or embodied in firmware or dedicated hardware.
Further, although the example program is described with reference to the flowcharts illustrated
in FIGS. 6-13, many other methods of implementing the example controller 400 and/or the
example controller 500 may alternatively be used. For example, the order of execution of the
blocks may be changed, and/or some of the blocks described may be changed, eliminated, or
combined.
[0081]    As mentioned above, the example processes of FIGS. 6-13 may be implemented

and/or any other storage media in which information is stored for any duration (e.g., for
extended time periods, permanently, brief instances, for temporarily buffering, and/or for
caching of the information). As used herein, the term tangible computer readable medium is
expressly defined to include any type of computer readable storage device or storage disc and
to exclude propagating signals. Additionally or alternatively, the example processes of FIGS. 6
13 may be implemented using coded instructions (e.g., computer readable instructions) stored
on a non-transitory computer readable medium such as a hard disk drive, a flash memory, a
read-only memory, a compact disk, a digital versatile disk, a cache, a random-access memory
and/or any other storage media in which information is stored for any duration (e.g., for
extended time periods, permanently, brief instances, for temporarily buffering, and/or for
caching of the information). As used herein, the term non-transitory computer readable
medium is expressly defined to include any type of computer readable storage device or

[0082]    FIG. 6 is a flow chart representative of example machine readable instructions that
may be executed to implement the example controller 400 of FIG. 4. The example instructions

                                               -25
600 of FIG. 6 are executed to raise or lower the covering 106. In some examples, the
instructions are initiated in response to a command from the input device 138 and/or the
instruction processor 408.
[0083]     The example instructions 600 of FIG. 6 begin by the instruction processor 408
receiving a command to move the covering 106 (block 602). For example, the instruction
processor 408 may receive the command from the input device 138 to raise the covering 106;
to lower the covering 106; to move the covering 106 to a lower limit position, an upper limit
position, a preset position between the lower limit position and the upper limit position; etc. The
angular position determiner 402 determines an angular position of the tube 104 based on tube
position information generated by the gravitational sensor 126 (block 604). Based on the
position of the covering 106 and the command, the instruction processor 408 instructs the
motor controller 412 to send a signal to the motor 120 to rotate the tube 104 to move the
covering 106. For example, if the covering 106 is at the lower limit position and the instruction
received from the input device 138 is to move the covering 106 to the upper limit position, the
instruction processor 408 provides instructions to the motor controller 412 to raise the covering
106. The example covering position determiner 406 may determine an amount of rotation of
the tube 104 (e.g., 1.5 revolutions, etc.) to move the covering 106 to a commanded position.
[0084]     The motor controller 412 sends a signal to the motor 120 to rotate the tube 104 to
move the covering 106 (block 606). While the tube 104 is rotating, the covering position
determiner 406 determines an amount of angular displacement of the tube 104 relative to a
previous angular position (block 608). For example, the covering position determiner 406 may
increment an amount of rotation of the tube 104 relative to the previous angular position and/or
subtract the previous angular position from an angular position determined based on tube
position information generated by the gravitational sensor 126. The covering position
determiner 406 may also increment a number of revolutions rotated by the tube 104.
[0085]     The covering position determiner 406 adjusts a stored position of the covering 106
based on the amount of angular displacement of the tube 104 (block 610). The example
covering position determiner 406 determines the position of the covering 106 relative to a
reference position such as, for example, the lower limit position, the fully unwound position,
etc. The position of the covering 106 may be determined in units of degrees, revolutions,
and/or any other unit of measurement relative to the reference position. In some examples, the
covering position determiner 406 determines the position of the covering 106 based on tube
position information generated by the gravitational sensor 126, the angular position information

                                                  -26
determined by the angular position determiner 402, the angular displacement of the tube 104,
and/or previously stored position information.
[0086]      The covering position determiner 406 determines if rotation of the tube 104 is
complete. For example, the covering position determiner 406 may determine if the covering
106 is at the commanded position and/or if the tube 104 has rotated the amount of rotation
determined by the covering position determiner 406 to move the covering 106 to the
commanded position. If the rotation is not complete, the example instructions 600 return to
block 608. If the rotation is complete (i.e., the covering 106 is at the commanded position or a
limit position), the motor controller 412 sends a signal to the motor 120 to stop rotation of the
tube 104 (block 612).
[0087]      FIG. 7 is a flow chart representative of example machine readable instructions which
may be executed to implement the example controller 500 of FIG. 5. The example instructions
700 of FIG. 7 are executed to determine the direction of rotation of the tube 104 that raises the
covering 106 (i.e., winds the covering 106 around the tube 104) and, conversely, the direction
of rotation of the tube 104 lowers the covering 106 (e.g., unwinds the covering 106 from the
tube 104). In some examples, the instructions 700 are initiated in response to an initial supply
of power to the controller 500, a manual input (e.g., a pull applied to the covering and rotating
or rocking the tube), a command from the input device and/or the programming processor 516
(e.g., to enter a programming mode, etc.), a temporary loss of power to the controller 500,
and/or other event or condition. In other examples, the instructions are executed continuously
and/or whenever there is movement of the tube 104.
[0088]      The example instructions 700 of FIG. 7 begins by the rotational direction determiner
510 responding to a command from the programming processor 516 by causing the motor
controller 524 to send a first signal of a first polarity to the motor 120 to cause the tube 104 to
move in a first angular direction (block 702). For example, the motor controller 524 of the
controller 500 sends a signal (e.g., voltage and/or current) having a positive polarity to the
motor 120 and, as a result, the motor 120 rotates the tube 104 in the first angular direction.
The motor controller 524 receives a voltage from the voltage rectifier 501 that has a constant
polarity and passes the voltage to the motor 120 directly or after modulating (e.g., switching)
the polarity to a desired polarity.
[0089]      The rotational direction determiner 510 determines the first angular direction (e.g.,
clockwise) based on movement of the tube 104 determined by the gravitational sensor 126

                                                  -27
(e.g., an accelerometer) (block 704). The current sensor 522 determines an amperage of the
first signal provided to the motor 120 (block 706). The rotational direction determiner 510
associates the first angular direction with the polarity of the first signal (block 708). For
example, the rotational direction determiner 510 associates a positive polarity with a clockwise
direction of rotation.
[0090]      The motor controller 524 of the illustrated example sends a second signal of a
second polarity to the motor 120 to cause the tube 104 to move in a second angular direction
opposite the first angular direction (block 710). In some such examples, the motor 120 rotates
the tube 104 or enables the tube 104 to rotate in the second angular direction (e.g., the motor
120 applies a torque less than a torque applied by the weight of the covering 106 to allow the
weight of the covering 106 to rotate the tube 104 to unwind the covering 106). The rotational
direction determiner 510 determines the second angular direction (e.g., counterclockwise)
based on movement of the tube 104 determined by the gravitational sensor 126 (block 712).
The current sensor 522 determines an amperage of the second signal (block 714). The
rotational direction determiner 510 associates the second angular direction with the polarity of
the second signal (block 716). In the illustrated example, the rotational direction determiner
510 associates the negative polarity with the counterclockwise direction.
[0091]      The rotational direction determiner 510 determines whether the amperage provided
to the motor 120 to move the tube 104 in the first direction is greater than the amperage
provided to the motor 120 to move the tube 104 in the second direction (block 718). If the
amperage provided to the motor 120 to move the tube 104 in the first direction is greater than
the amperage provided to the motor 120 to move the tube 104 in the second direction, the
rotational direction determiner 510 associates the first angular direction and the polarity of the
first signal with raising the covering 106 (i.e., winding the covering 106 onto the tube 104)
(block 720) and associates the second angular direction and the polarity of the second signal
with lowering the covering 106 (i.e., unwinding the covering 106 from the tube 104) (block
722). If the amperage provided to the motor 120 to move the tube 104 in the first direction is
less than the amperage provided to the motor 120 to move the tube 104 in the second
direction, the rotational direction determiner 510 associates the first angular direction and the
polarity of the first signal with lowering the covering 106 (block 724) and associates the second
angular direction and the polarity of the second signal with raising the covering 106 (block
726). The associations may be stored in the memory 526 to be referenced by the controller
500 when receiving instructions to raise or lower the cover 102.

                                                  -28
[0092]      FIG. 8 is a flow chart of example machine readable instructions which may be
executed to implement the example controller 500 of FIG. 5. The example instructions 800 of
FIG. 8 are executed to determine and/or set a fully unwound position (e.g., where the covering
106 is fully unwound from the tube 104). The example instructions 800 may be initiated in
response to an initial supply of power to the controller 500, a manual input, a command from
the input device 138 and/or the programming processor 516, continuously whenever the tube
104 moves, and/or in response to any other event or condition.
[0093]      In the example of FIG. 8, the instructions 800 begin when the fully unwound position
determiner 512 responds to a command from the programming processor 516 to determine a
fully unwound position by sending a signal to the motor controller 524 to lower the covering
106 (block 802). For example, the motor controller 524 responds to the signal from the fully
unwound position determiner 512 by sending a signal to the motor 120 to cause the motor 120
to rotate in the unwinding direction. In some examples, a polarity of the signal is associated
with the unwinding direction (e.g., by repeating the instructions of 700 of FIG. 7). In some
examples, the motor 120 drives the tube 104 in the unwinding direction. In other examples, the
motor 120 enables the weight of the covering 106 to cause the tube 104 to rotate in the
unwinding direction and the motor 120 does not oppose the unwinding or opposes it with less
force than the force applied by the weight of the covering 106.
[0094]      The tube rotational speed determiner 508 of the illustrated example determines
whether the tube 104 is rotating (block 804). For example, the gravitational sensor 126 (e.g.,
an accelerometer) detects movement of the tube 104, and the example rotational speed
determiner 508 determines whether the position of the covering 106 is changing over a time
imposed with reference to the example clock 504. In some examples, due to a provided dead
band (i.e., a lost motion path) when the motor is operatively disengaged from the tube 104, a
one-way gear that prevents the motor from driving the tube 104 in the unwinding direction,
and/or any other component, the tube 104 stops rotating, at least temporarily, when the
covering 106 reaches its lowermost position (e.g., the fully unwound position). If the rotational
speed determiner 508 determines that the tube 104 is rotating, the example instructions 800
return to block 802 to continue waiting for the tube 104 to stop rotating, which indicates that the
covering 106 has reached its lowermost position.
[0095]      If the tube 104 is not rotating (block 804), the fully unwound position determiner 512
of the illustrated example determines the position of the tube 104 where the covering 106 is
substantially fully unwound (i.e., the fully unwound position) (block 806). For example, when

                                                -29
the motor 120 is provided with the signal to lower the covering 106 but the tube 104 is rotated
to or past the fully unwound position, the motor 120 drives at least partially through the dead
band. As a result, the tube 104 does not rotate for a time, and the lack of movement of the
tube 104 is determined or sensed by the gravitational sensor 126 and the tube rotational speed
determiner 508. Based on the signal sent to the motor 120 and the lack of movement of the
tube 104 while the motor 120 drives through the dead band, the fully unwound position
determiner 512 determines that the tube 104 is in the fully unwound position.
[0096]      The programming processor 516 sets and stores the fully unwound position (block
808). In some examples, the fully unwound position is stored in the example information
storage device 526 as a position of zero revolutions. In other examples, the fully unwound
position is stored in the example information storage device 526 as a position relative to one or
more frames of reference (e.g., a reference axis of the gravitational sensor 126, a previously
determined fully unwound position, etc.). In some such examples, the fully unwound position is
adjusted based on the one or more frames of reference.
[0097]      In some examples, the covering position monitor 514 determines other position(s) of
the tube 104 relative to the fully unwound position during operation of the example
architectural opening covering assembly 100. For example, when the tube 104 is moved, the
covering position monitor 514 determines a count of revolutions of the tube 104 in the winding
direction away from the fully unwound position based on rotation information provided by the
example gravitational sensor 126.
[0098]      In some examples, after the fully unwound position is stored, the tube 104 is rotated
one or more revolutions from the fully unwound position in the winding direction to reduce the
strain of the covering 106 on the fixture that attaches the covering 106 to the tube 104. In such
examples, the covering position monitor 514 determines or detects the amount of movement of
the tube 104 in the winding direction based on the angular movement information provided by
the gravitational sensor 126, and the motor controller 524 sends a signal to the motor 120 to
drive the motor 120 in the winding direction.
[0099]      FIG. 9 is a flow chart of example machine readable instructions which may be
executed to implement the controller 500 of FIG. 5. The example input device 138 transmits
signals to the example controller 500 to provide instructions or commands to perform an action
such as, for example, rotating the tube 104 via the motor 120, entering a programming mode,
etc. In some examples, a polarity of the signal is modulated (e.g., alternated) by the input

                                                  - 30
device 138 to define the instructions or commands. For example, particular polarity modulation
patterns may be associated with particular instructions as described below. Other examples
employ other communication techniques (e.g., data communication, packetized
communication, other modulation techniques or algorithms, etc.).
[00100]     The following commands and actions are merely examples, and other commands
and/or actions may be used in other examples. The example instructions 900 of FIG. 9 begin
when the polarity sensor 502 determines a polarity of a signal received from the input device
138 (block 902). In the illustrated example, the signal from the input device 138 has a positive
polarity or a negative polarity, which can be modulated (e.g., alternated or reversed) by a
polarity switch. The signal instruction processor 506 determines a number of polarity
modulations within a corresponding amount of time (block 904). The amount of time is a time
period that is sufficiently short to ensure that the entire command is recognized and that two
commands or other fluctuations of the signal are not identified or misinterpreted as a first
command. For example, if the polarity of the signal modulations from positive to negative to
positive within the amount of time, the signal instruction processor 506 determines that two
polarity modulations occurred within the measured amount of time. In some examples, the
length of the time period is about one second. In some examples, the time period may be
tracked by starting a timer when a first polarity modulation occurs and detecting polarity
modulations that occur before the timer expires. Additionally or alternatively, a sliding window
having a width equal to the time period may be used to analyze the signal and polarity
modulations in the window may be detected. Any suitable method for determining polarity
modulations may be used (e.g., a synch may be detected, a start signal and a stop signal may
be detected, etc.).
[00101]     If no (i.e., zero) polarity modulations occur in a given window (block 906), the
example instructions 900 returns to block 904 to continue monitoring for polarity modulations. If
one polarity modulation occurs (block 908), the motor controller 524 sends a signal to the
motor 120 to rotate the tube 104 in a first direction (block 910). In some examples, if one
polarity modulation occurs and the polarity of the signal modulated from positive to negative,
the tube 104 rotates in a direction associated with the negative polarity. In some examples, the
polarity of the signal is associated with the unwinding direction or the winding direction using
the example instructions 700 of FIG. 7.
[00102]     Then, the covering position monitor 514 determines if the covering 106 is at a first
limit position (block 912). In some examples, the first limit position is a predetermined lower

                                                  -31
limit position such as, for example, a preset lower limit position, the fully unwound position, one
revolution away from the fully unwound position in the winding direction, an upper limit
position, or any other suitable position. The example covering position monitor 514 determines
the position of the covering 106 based on the rotation of the tube 104 relative to the fully
lowered position and/or the lower limit position. If the covering position monitor 514 determines
that the covering 106 is not at the first limit position, the example instructions 900 return to
block 910. If the covering position monitor 514 determines that the tube 104 is at the first limit
position, the motor controller 524 causes the motor 120 to stop (block 914). The instructions of
FIG. 9 may be terminated or may return to block 904.
[00103]     Returning to the NO result of block 908, if two polarity modulations occur (block 916),
the motor controller 524 sends a signal to the motor 120 to rotate the tube 104 in a second
direction opposite the first direction (block 918). In some examples, if two polarity modulations
occur and the polarity modulations from positive to negative to positive within the amount of
time, the tube 104 is rotated in a direction associated with the positive polarity (e.g., the
winding direction). At block 920, the covering position monitor 514 determines whether the
covering 106 is at a second limit position. In some examples, the second limit is a
predetermined upper limit position. If the covering 106 is not at the second limit position, the
example instructions 900 returns to block 918 to wait for the tube 104 to reach the second limit
position. If the covering 106 is at the second limit position, the motor controller 524 causes the
motor 120 to stop (block 922). As described in greater detail below, the user may set the lower
limit position and the upper limit position via a programming mode.
[00104]     If three polarity modulations occur (block 923), the motor controller 524 sends a
signal to the motor 120 to rotate the tube 104 to an intermediate position corresponding to an
amount of time that passed between the second polarity modulation and the third polarity
modulation (block 924). For example, the amount of opening may be indicated by an amount
of time between 0 and 1 second. For example, if the amount of time between the second
polarity modulation and the third polarity modulation is about 400 milliseconds, the motor
controller 524 sends a signal to the motor 120 to rotate the tube 104 to a position
corresponding to a position a distance of about 40 percent of a distance between the lower
limit position and the upper limit position (i.e., the covering 106 is about 40 percent open). In
some examples, amount of opening of the covering 106 that is desired and, thus, the amount
of time in the command, corresponds to an amount of sunlight shining onto a side of a building
in which the example architectural opening covering assembly 100 is disposed. For example,
the input device 138 may include a light sensor to detect and measure light shining onto the

                                                 - 32
side of the building, and the covering 106 will be opened further when there is less light and
will be closed further when there is more light.
[00105]     If four polarity modulations occur (block 926), the motor controller 524 sends a signal
to the motor 120 to rotate the tube 104 to a predetermined position (block 928). In some
examples, the predetermined position is an intermediate position between the lower limit and
the upper limit. If the number of polarity modulations within the amount of time is greater than
four, the example programming processor 516 causes the example controller 500 to enter a
programming mode (block 930). As described in greater detail below, a user may set position
limits using the input device 138 while the controller 500 is in the programming mode.
[00106]     FIG. 10 is a flowchart representative of example machine readable instructions
which may be executed to implement the example controller 500 of FIG. 5. In some examples,
the controller 500, and the input device 138 cooperate to control the example architectural
opening covering assembly 100 disclosed herein. In some examples, the tube rotational speed
determiner 508 may detect a manual input and, based on the manual input, the motor
controller 524 causes the motor 120 to facilitate or assist movement of the tube 104, prevent
movement of the tube 104 (e.g., to prevent the manual input from moving the covering 106
past an upper or lower limit), or terminate operation of the motor 120. In some examples, the
manual input may override operation of the motor 120 by the motor controller 524.
[00107]     Because the gravitational sensor 126 determines tube position information and/or
angular positions of the tube 104, the gravitational sensor 126 may be used to sense any
manual input that causes the tube 104 to rotate and/or affects rotation of the tube 104 (e.g.,
speed of the rotation, direction of the rotation). In some examples, if the covering 106 is lifted,
pulled, or contacts an obstruction (e.g., a hand of a user, a sill of an architectural opening,
etc.), the tube 104 rotates, the tube 104 rotates at a speed different than the speed at which
the motor 120 is to drive the tube 104, and/or the tube 104 rotates in a direction different than
the direction in which the motor 120 is to rotate the tube 104. In some examples, operation of
the input device 138 (e.g., a cord drivable actuator) rotates and/or affects rotation of the tube
104. Thus, based on the angular positions of the tube 104 determined via the gravitational
sensor 126, the direction of rotation of the tube 104 determine by the tube directional
determiner 510, and/or the speed of rotation of the tube 104 determined by the tube rotational
speed determiner 508, the manual instruction processor 518 may determine that a manual
input is occurring.

                                                - 33
[00108]    The example instructions 1000 of FIG. 10 begin with the covering position monitor
514 sensing movement of the tube 104 (block 1002). In some examples, the covering position
monitor 514 continuously senses the position of the covering 106. For example, the
gravitational sensor 126 and/or the covering position monitor 514 determines angular positions
of rotation of the tube 104, which the covering position monitor 514 uses to determine positions
of the covering 106 relative to the fully unwound position or the lower limit position. The tube
rotational speed determiner 508 determines whether the motor 120 is moving the tube 104
(block 1004). For example, the tube rotational speed determiner 508 determines whether a
manual input is moving the tube 104 or the motor 120 is moving the tube 104 in response to a
command from the motor controller 524. If the motor 120 is moving the tube 104, the manual
instruction processor 518 determines whether a manual countermand is being provided (block
1006). For example, if only the motor 120 is rotating the tube 104, the speed at which the tube
104 rotates is based on the speed of the motor 120. If the manual instruction processor 518
determines that the tube 104 is rotating at an unexpected speed or in an unexpected direction
(e.g., rotating faster or slower than the speed at which only the motor 120 rotates the tube 104,
not rotating, rotating in a direction opposite a direction commanded by the motor controller
524, etc.), then the manual instruction processor 518 determines that the manual input is being
provided (e.g., via the input device 138, via a pull on the covering 106, via an obstruction
contacting the covering 106, etc.). In some examples, if the manual input causes the tube 104
to rotate slower than the speed at which the motor 120 rotates the tube 104, stop rotating,
and/or rotate in a direction opposite a direction commanded by the motor controller 524, the
manual input is a manual countermand. In some examples, the manual countermand is a
manual input in either a direction of the rotation of the motor 120 or the direction opposite the
rotation of the motor 120.
[00109]     If no manual countermand is provided (block 1006), the motor controller 524 sends a
signal to the motor 120 to cause the tube 104 to move to a commanded position (block 1008).
In some examples, the commanded position is the lower limit position, the upper limit position,
or any other set position such as, for example, an intermediate position between the upper limit
position and the lower limit position. The example instructions then returns to block 1202.
[00110]     If a manual countermand is being provided (block 1006), the motor controller 524
sends a signal to stop the motor 120 (block 1010). Thus, the manual input may countermand
or cancel the command from the motor controller 524. The example instructions then returns to
block 1002.

                                                - 34
[00111]     Returning to block 1004, if the motor 120 is not moving the tube 104 (i.e., a manual
input is moving the tube 104), the covering position monitor 514 determines whether the
manual input is moving the covering 106 past a limit (block 1012). For example, a user may
provide a manual input to rotate the tube 104 to move the covering 106 past the lower limit
position or the upper limit position. In such examples, the covering position monitor 514
determines the position of the covering 106 relative to the lower limit position and/or the fully
unwound position. In some examples, the current sensor 522 determines an amperage of the
current supplied to the motor 120 to determine whether the tube 104 is rotating to move the
covering 106 past the upper limit position. For example, if the covering 106 fully winds around
the tube 104, an end of the covering 106 may engage a portion of the example architectural
opening covering assembly 100, which causes the amperage supplied to the motor 120 to
increase. In such examples, if the motor controller 524 determines that the increase in the
amperage has occurred, the motor controller 524 determines that the tube 104 is rotating to
move the covering 106 past the upper limit position. In other examples, if the manual input
moves the covering 106 past the upper limit by a predetermined amount (e.g., one half of a
rotation or more), the example controller 500 again determines the fully unwound position
using, for example, the example instructions 800 of FIG. 8. For example, the fully unwound
position may be determined again because it is assumed that the calibration of the tube
rotation may have been lost because the covering 106 moved past an upper limit of the
architectural opening covering assembly 100.
[00112]     If the manual input is moving the covering 106 past the limit (block 1012), the motor
controller 524 sends a signal to the motor 120 to drive the motor 120 in a direction opposite of
the movement of the tube 104 caused by the manual input (block 1014). For example, if the
manual input is moving the covering 106 past the lower limit position, the motor controller 524
sends a signal to the motor 120 to drive the tube 104 in the winding direction. The manual
instruction processor 518 again determines whether the user is providing a manual input
causing the covering 106 to move past the limit (block 1016). If the user is not providing a
manual input causing the covering 106 to move past the limit, the motor controller 524 sends a
signal to the motor 120 to stop (block 1018), and the example instructions returns to block
1002. Accordingly, the tube 104 is prevented from rotating to move the covering 106 past the
limit.
[00113]     Returning to block 1012, if the manual input is not moving the covering 106 past the
limit, the manual instruction processor 518 determines whether the manual input has rotated
the tube 104 a threshold amount (block 1020). In some examples, the threshold amount

                                                 - 35
corresponds to at least a number of tube rotations. In some such examples, the threshold
amount is at least a quarter of one revolution. In some examples, the manual instruction
processor 518 determines whether the manual input is provided for a continuous amount of
time (e.g., at least two seconds). In other examples, the manual instruction processor 518
determines whether the manual input is provided for a total amount of time such as, for
example, two seconds within a threshold period amount of time such as, for example, 3
seconds. In some examples, the manual instruction processor 518 determines the amount of
time the manual input is provided in only a first direction or a second direction. In some
examples, the manual instruction processor 518 determines whether the manual input is equal
to or greater than a threshold distance in the first direction or the second direction within the
threshold amount of time.
[00114]     If the manual instruction processor 518 determines that the manual input is not
provided for a threshold amount of time or distance, the example instructions returns to block
1002. If the manual input is provided for the threshold amount of time or distance, the motor
controller 524 sends a signal to the motor 120 to move the tube 104 in a direction
corresponding to the movement of the tube 104 caused by the manual input (block 1022). For
example, if the manual input causes the covering 106 to rise, the motor controller 524 sends a
signal to the motor 120 to cause the motor 120 to drive the tube 104 in the winding direction.
The covering position monitor 514 determines whether the covering 106 is at the limit (block
1024). If the covering 106 is not at the limit, the example instructions return to block 1002. If
the covering 106 is at the limit, the manual instruction processor 518 determines whether the
manual input is causing the covering 106 to move past the limit (block 1016). If the manual
input is causing the covering 106 to move past the limit, the motor controller 524 sends a
signal to the motor 120 to drive the tube 104 in the direction opposite of the movement caused
by the manual input (block 1014). If the manual input is not causing the covering 106 to move
past the limit, the motor controller 524 causes the motor 120 to stop (block 1018), and the
example instructions returns to block 1002.
[00115]     FIGS. 11-13 is a flow chart of example machine readable instructions 1100 which
may be used to implement the example controller 500 of FIG. 5. In some examples, the input
device 138 causes the example controller 500 to enter a programming mode in which the input
device 138 is used to set one or more positions (e.g., lower limit position, an upper limit
position, and/or other positions) of the covering 106. During normal operation or operative
mode, when the input device 138 sends a signal to the controller 500 to move to the one of the
positions, of the controller 500 causes the motor 120 to move the covering 106 to the position.

                                                 - 36
[00116]     The example instructions 1100 of FIG. 11 begin with the controller 500 receiving a
command from the input device 138 to enter a programming mode (block 1102). In some
examples, the signal instruction processor 506 of the controller 500 determines that the signal
from the input device 138 corresponds to a command to enter the programming mode using
the example instructions 900 of FIG. 9. In some examples, in response to the command to
enter the programming mode, the rotational direction determiner 510 determines the winding
direction and the unwinding direction using the example instructions 700 of FIG. 7. In some
examples, in response to receiving the command to enter the programming mode, the fully
unwound position determiner 512 determines the fully unwound position of the covering 106
using the example instructions 800 of FIG. 8. After the input device 138 sends the command to
the controller 500 to enter the programming mode, the input device 138 causes an indication to
be provided (block 1104). For example, the input device 138 causes a sound to be provided, a
light to blink, and/or any other suitable indication.
[00117]     In response to the command from the input device 138, the motor controller 524
sends a signal to the motor 120 to move the covering 106 toward a lower limit position (e.g., a
previously set lower limit position, the fully unwound position, one revolution of the tube 104
from the fully unwound position in the winding direction, etc.) (block 1106). In some examples,
the manual instruction processor 518 continuously determines whether a manual countermand
has occurred while the covering 106 is moving. For example, a manual countermand may be
provided via a user. If the manual instruction processor 518 determines that a manual
countermand occurred, the motor 120 is stopped. If the manual instruction processor 518
determines that no manual countermand occurred, the motor 120 is stopped when the
covering 106 is at the lower limit position (block 1108). In other examples, the manual
instruction processor 518 does not continuously determine whether a manual countermand
occurs while the covering 106 is moving, and the motor 120 is stopped when the covering 106
is at the lower limit position.
[00118]     The covering position monitor 514 determines positions of the covering 106 (block
1110). For example, after the covering 106 is stopped at the lower limit position, the user may
rotate the tube 104 via the input device 138 (e.g., to a desired position), and the covering
position monitor 514 determines positions of the covering 106 relative to the fully unwound
position and/or the lower limit position based on the angular positions of the tube 104 detected
by the gravitational sensor 126. The programming processor 516 determines whether a
programming signal is received from the input device 138 (block 1112). In some examples, the
programming processor 516 determines whether a signal sent from the input device 138 is a

                                                - 37
programming signal using the example instructions 900 of FIG. 9. In some such examples, the
programming signal is a signal having six polarity modulations within a period of time (e.g., one
second). If the programming processor 516 determines that the programming signal is not
received, the programming processor 516 determines whether a threshold amount of time has
elapsed (e.g., since the motor 120 was stopped at the lower limit position) (block 1113). If the
threshold amount of time has elapsed, the programming processor 516 causes the controller
500 to exit the programming mode (block 1114). In some examples, the threshold amount of
time is thirty minutes. If the threshold amount of time has not elapsed, the example instructions
return to block 1110.
[00119]     If the programming signal is received from the input device 138, the programming
processor 516 sets a lower limit position (block 1116). In such examples, the lower limit
position is a position of the covering 106 when the programming signal was received at block
1112. The input device causes an indication to be provided (block 1318).
[00120]    Continuing to FIG. 12, after block 1118, the motor controller 524 sends a signal to
the motor 120 to move the covering 106 to an upper limit position (block 1200). For example, if
a previously set upper limit position exists, the motor controller 524 causes the motor 120 to
rotate the tube 104 to move the covering 106 toward the previously set upper limit position. In
some examples, no previously set upper limit position exists (e.g., after power is initially
supplied to the example controller 500). If no previously set upper limit position exists, the
motor controller 524 causes the motor 120 to rotate the tube 104 in the winding direction
toward a position corresponding to a number of revolutions (e.g., one, two, one and one half,
etc.) of the tube 104 in the winding direction from the lower limit position.
[00121]    After the covering 106 moves to the upper limit position, the covering position
monitor 514 determines positions of the covering 106 (block 1202). For example, after the
covering 106 is stopped at the upper limit position, the user may move the covering 106 via the
input device 138 (e.g., to a desired position), and the covering position monitor 514 determines
positions of the covering 106 relative to the fully unwound position, the lower limit position, the
upper limit position, etc.
[00122]    The programming processor 516 determines whether a programming signal is
received from the input device 138 (block 1204). If the programming processor 516 determines
that the programming signal is not received, the programming processor 516 determines
whether a threshold amount of time has elapsed (e.g., since the covering 106 moved to the

                                                - 38
upper limit position) (block 1205). If the threshold amount of time has not elapsed, the example
instructions return to block 1202. If the threshold amount of time has elapsed, the
programming processor 516 causes the controller 500 to exit the programming mode (block
1206). In some examples, the threshold amount of time is thirty minutes.
[00123]     If the programming signal is received from the input device 138, the programming
processor 516 sets an upper limit position (block 1208). The input device 138 causes an
indication to be provided (block 1210).
[00124]    Continuing to FIG. 13, after block 1210, the motor controller 524 sends a signal to
the motor 120 to move the covering 106 to an intermediate position (i.e., a position between
the lower limit position and the upper limit position) (block 1300). For example, if a previously
set intermediate position exists, the motor controller 524 causes the motor 120 to rotate the
tube 104 to move the covering 106 toward the previously set intermediate position. In some
examples, no previously set intermediate position exists (e.g., after power is initially supplied to
the example controller 500). If no previously set intermediate position exists, the motor
controller 524 causes the motor 120 to rotate the tube 104 in the unwinding direction toward a
position corresponding to a number of revolutions (e.g., one, two, one and one half, etc.) of the
tube 104 in the unwinding direction from the upper limit position or toward any other suitable
position (e.g., half way between the upper limit position and the lower limit position).
[00125]    After the covering 106 moves to the intermediate position, the covering position
monitor 514 determines positions of the covering 106 (block 1302). For example, after the
covering 106 is stopped at the intermediate position, the user may move the covering 106 via
the input device 138 (e.g., to a desired position), and the covering position monitor 514
determines positions of the covering 106 relative to the fully unwound position, the lower limit
position, the upper limit position, etc.
[00126]    The programming processor 516 determines whether a programming signal is
received from the input device 138 (block 1304). If the programming processor 516 determines
that the programming signal is not received, the programming processor 516 determines
whether a threshold amount of time has elapsed (e.g., since the covering 106 was moved to
the intermediate position) (block 1305). If the threshold amount of time has elapsed, the
programming processor 516 causes the controller 500 to exit the programming mode (block
1306). If the programming processor 516 determines that the threshold amount of time has not

                                                - 39
elapsed, the example instructions return to block 1302. In some examples, the threshold
amount of time is thirty minutes.
[00127]    If the programming signal is received from the input device 138, the programming
processor 516 sets and stores an intermediate position (block 1308). The input device 138
causes an indication to be provided (block 1310), and the programming processor 516 causes
the controller 500 to exit the programming mode (block 1312). In some examples, the
programming mode is used to set one or more other positions.
[00128]    FIG. 14 is a block diagram of an example processor platform 1400 capable of
executing the instructions of FIGS 6-13 to implement the input device 138, the example first
input device 310, the example second input device 312, the example controller 400 and/or the
example controller 500. The processor platform 1400 can be, for example, a server, a personal
computer, or any other suitable type of computing device.
[00129]    The processor platform 1400 of the instant example includes a processor 1412. For
example, the processor 1412 can be implemented by one or more microprocessors or
controllers from any desired family or manufacturer.
[00130]    The processor 1412 includes a local memory 1413 (e.g., a cache) and is in
communication with a main memory including a volatile memory 1414 and a non-volatile
memory 1416 via a bus 1418. The volatile memory 1414 may be implemented by Synchronous
Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM), Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM),
RAMBUS Dynamic Random Access Memory (RDRAM) and/or any other type of random
access memory device. The non-volatile memory 1416 may be implemented by flash memory
and/or any other desired type of memory device. Access to the main memory 1414, 1416 is
controlled by a memory controller.
[00131]    The processor platform 1400 also includes an interface circuit 1420. The interface
circuit 1420 may be implemented by any type of interface standard, such as an Ethernet
interface, a universal serial bus (USB), and/or a PCI express interface.
[00132]    One or more input devices 1422 are connected to the interface circuit 1420. The
input device(s) 1422 permit a user to enter data and commands into the processor 1412. The
input device(s) can be implemented by, for example, a keyboard, a mouse, a touchscreen, a
track-pad, a trackball, isopoint, a button, a switch, and/or a voice recognition system.

[00133]      One or more output devices 1424 are also connected to the interface circuit 1420.
The output devices 1424 can be implemented, for example, by display devices (e.g., a liquid
crystal display, speakers, etc.).
[00134]      The processor platform 1400 also includes one or more mass storage devices 1428
(e.g., flash memory drive) for storing software and data. The mass storage device 1428 may
implement the local storage device 1413.
[00135]      The coded instructions 1432 of FIGS 6-13 may be stored in the mass storage device
1428, in the volatile memory 1414, in the non-volatile memory 1416, and/or on a removable
storage medium such as a flash memory drive.
[00136]      From the foregoing, it will appreciate that the above disclosed instructions, methods,
apparatus and articles of manufacture enable one or more architectural opening covering
assemblies to be controlled by simply pulling on or otherwise applying force to the covering.
The example architectural opening covering assemblies disclosed herein include a
gravitational sensor to determine a position of an architectural opening covering, detect an
input applied to the covering (e.g., by moving the covering by hand) and/or monitor movement
of the covering based on gravity and/or movement relative to a gravity reference. In some
examples, the gravitational sensor determines angular positions of a roller tube on which the
covering is at least partially wound. In some examples, the gravitational sensors are used to
determine if a manual input (e.g., a pull on the covering, operation of an device, etc.) is
provided. In some instances, in response to the manual input, an example controller controls
the motor to perform the action instructed by the input (e.g., to move the covering, stop
movement of the covering, and/or counter the manual input to prevent lowering or raising the
architectural opening covering past a threshold position such as, for example, a lower limit
position or an upper limit position, etc.).
[00137]      Although certain example methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture have
been described herein, the scope of coverage of this patent is not limited thereto. On the
Provisional contrary, this patent covers all methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture
fairly falling within the scope of this patent.
