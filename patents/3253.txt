TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]                  The present invention generally relates to mounting methods and devices for
use with relocatable structures.
BACKGROUND
[0002]                  Relocatable structures are well known in many fields, particularly construction
and mining. Examples of relocatable structures include portable buildings, sheltered
walkways, processing plant and equipment, and a wide variety of other temporary
equipment or shelter.
[0003]                  One specific example of a relocatable structure is the relocatable conveyor as
described in international patent publication no. WO 2018/085891. This structure has a
"drop down" support leg feature which facilitates quick installation of the conveyor and
allows it to be easily relocatable. Small plates with protrusions from a lower surface,
sometimes known as stakers, are used to resist lateral movement. However, these are not
rated to prevent uplift, despite preventing being a key consideration in cyclonic regions or
high wind zones.
[0004]                  Drop down legs are also unable to be preinstalled on site whilst the conveyor is
being fabricated and thus increase installation times with associated costs and safety
implications. An alternative method of support is therefore desired to overcome these
problems that can anchor the conveyor modules to the ground whilst still offering suitable
installation times and enable relocation.
[0005]                  More generally, overland conveyor systems and many other structures are
typically supported on concrete footings or sleepers. These arrangements offer a positive
connection to resist movement but are not relocatable and have high install costs. The
relocatable conveyor concept described above is designed with drop down support legs and
stakers, but requires additional anchoring if used in high wind areas. This may be in the

                                                            -2
form of support cables and/or ground anchors, for example. These can be expensive, time
consuming to install and impede access to the conveyor during operations.
[0006]                  Overland conveyor concrete footings are often used because they provide a
robust connection to the ground, they are a conventional technology and widely used in
civil engineering, in some cases they may be cheaper for initial use, and they are suitable
for a wide range of geology and ground surfaces. However, these concrete footings or
sleepers have very high installation cost, lengthy installation time, are unable to be reused,
cause difficulty in remediating the site after use, are not suited to high wind in the case of
the drop down leg approach, and have poor health, safety and environmental outcomes due
to increased site exposure times.
[0007]                  The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information
derived from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as, an
acknowledgement or admission or any form of suggestion that prior publication (or
information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general
knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates.
SUMMARY
[0008]                  According to one example aspect, there is provided a connector for mounting a
relocatable structure on a ground engaging device, the connector including: a first
component configured for connection to the ground engaging device; and a second
component configured for connection to the relocatable structure; wherein the first and
second components are connected to one another by a joint that includes a plate held
between two convex surfaces and the joint permits angular adjustment between the first
and second mounting components.
[0009]                  In one form, the plate is part of the second component, a first of the convex
surfaces is fixed to the first component and a second of the convex surfaces is in the form
of a washer fitted to a threaded shaft, such that a nut can be used to force the second
convex surface toward the first convex surface, thereby sandwiching the plate between the
convex surfaces.

[0010]                  In another form, the first component includes a base plate with slots and the
ground engaging device includes a mounting plate with slots, so that fasteners can be
inserted through the slots of the base plate and the mounting plate to fix them to one
another, wherein the slots of the base plate are arranged normal to the slots of the mounting
plate to permit adjustment of the position of the first component in multiple directions
within a plane of the base plate. Preferably, the position of the base plate in a direction
normal to the plane of the base plate can be adjusted.
[0011]                  In other particular, but non-limiting, example forms, the second component
includes a twist lock configured for connecting to a casting of the relocatable structure. In
one form, the relocatable structure is in the form of an intermodal freight container or is
configured to be transportable as an intermodal freight container.
[0012]                  In another form, the second component includes holes through which pins can
be inserted, the pins when in the holes being located so that the second component can be
mounted to the relocatable structure in one of a plurality of locations.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0022]                  The following modes, given by way of example only, are described in order to
provide a more precise understanding of the subject matter of a preferred embodiment or
embodiments.
[0023]                  In the Figures, incorporated to illustrate features of an example embodiment,
like reference numerals are used to identify like parts throughout the Figures.
[0024]                  Referring to Figure 1, an example of a ground engaging device, or ground
screw 10, that can be used with the present invention is shown. The ground screw 10
includes an elongate body 12 that is tapered at a lower end and includes one or more
threads 13. At an upper end of the ground screw 10 is a mounting plate 15 that has a
number of circular holes 16, a first pair of slots 17, and a second pair of slots 18 that are
arranged to be facing in a direction normal to the first pair 17.
[0025]                  The ground screw 10 is inserted into a substrate surface by rotating the screw
10 while pushing towards the substrate surface, the threads 13 helping to force the ground
screw 10 into the substrate. The holes 16 allow the ground screw 10 to be securely gripped
by known installation machinery.

                                                            -5
[0026]                  Referring to Figure 2, a ground screw connector 20 according to a first
embodiment of the invention is shown. The connector 20 is designed for mounting a
relocatable structure to the ground screw 10. The connector 20 includes a first component
or lower portion 21 that has a base plate 22 for connection to the ground screw 10. The
connector also has a second component or upper portion 23 for connection to the
relocatable structure.
[0027]                  The base plate 22 has slots 25 that allow fasteners 26 to be inserted through the
slots 25 of the base plate 22 and the slots 17, 18 of the mounting plate 15 to fix them to one
another. The slots 17, 18 of the mounting plate 15 are arranged so that they face in a
direction tangential to a circle with the centre at the centre of the mounting plate 15, or the
longitudinal axis of the screw 10. That is, the first pair 17 are parallel to one another and
the second pair are parallel to one another. In contrast, the slots 25 of the base plate 22 are
arranged so that they align in a radial direction to the axis of the screw 10. Therefore, when
the base plate 22 is placed on the mounting plate 15 the slots 25 of the base plate 22 are
normal to the corresponding slots 17, 18 of the mounting plate 15. This permits adjustment
of the position of the base plate 22 in any direction within a plane of the base plate 22.
[0028]                  The position of the base plate 22 in a direction normal to the plane of the base
plate 22 can also be adjusted by placing one or more shims 28 between the base plate 22
and the mounting plate 15. Preferably, at least 30mm of adjustment is possible, however it
will be appreciated that in alternative embodiments this may vary. It will also be
appreciated that in other alternative embodiments various other layouts of the slots may be
possible.
[0029]                  Referring to Figure 3, the ground screw connector 20 is shown in more detail.
The lower component 21 and the upper component 23 are connected to one another by a
joint 29 that permits angular adjustment between them. This joint 29 includes a plate 30
held between two convex surfaces. Vertical plates 31 support a twist lock fitting 34 that
can be used to connect the upper component 23 to a casting of the relocatable structure,
which may be in the form of a corner casting as is known for use on intermodal freight
containers, for example.

H:\kxd\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\KXD\17048664_.doex-26/06/20l8
                                                            -6
[0030]                  Referring to Figure 4, a convex surface 36 is fixed to a spacer 37, which in turn
is fixed to the base plate 22. A threaded shaft 38 is also fixed to the lower component 21 so
that it extends from the convex surface 36. A second convex surface 40 is in the form of a
washer. The convex washer 40 is fitted to the threaded shaft 38 and a nut 42 is used to
prevent the washer 40 from moving off the shaft 38. The plate 30 of the upper component
23 is held in place between the two convex surfaces 36, 40. The nut 42 is used to force the
convex washer 40 toward the first convex surface 36 and thereby sandwich the plate 30
between the convex surfaces 36, 40.
[0031]                  Referring to Figure 5, the plate 30 has a hole 44 through which the shaft 36
extends. This hole 44 has chamfered edges 45 with which the convex surfaces 36, 40 abut
when assembled. In the preferred embodiment, the configuration allows adjustment of the
shaft 38 by 150 in any direction, however it will be appreciated that in alternative
embodiments this value may be different.
[0032]                  In one method of use of the invention, the relocatable structure can be an
intermodal freight container or may be configured to be transportable as an intermodal
freight container. Such a structure would therefore have corner castings, allowing the twist
lock fitting 34 of the ground screw connector 20 to connect the ground screw 10 to the
corner casting.
[0033]                  In use, desired positions for the relocatable structures are first established and
documented following analysis of topography, position requirements and calculations for
the area in which the structures are to be installed. Final positions are then communicated
to the ground screw installer. Ground screws are then screwed into the ground at
designated position and height using installation machinery that provides the required
motive force and pressure.
[0034]                  The ground screw connectors 20 can then be attached, with lateral and
longitudinal adjustment being provided by the slots 17, 18, 25. Vertical adjustment is
provided by insertion of the shims 28, and angular adjustment is provided by the joint 29.
Together these adjustments all allow the structures to be attached in a surveyed position in
the event of misalignment of the ground screw 10 during the installation process.

                                                            -7
[0035]                  In the case where the relocatable structure is a conveyor module, such as was
described in the background section with reference to international patent publication no.
WO 2018/085891, this adjustment also allows alignment of the modules for proper
conveyor belt tracking. It also allows the containerised conveyor to negotiate horizontal
and vertical curves when fixed to the ground with ground screws.
[0036]                  An advantage of this process is that ground screw foundations can be installed
during the conveyor manufacture process rather than when the conveyor modules are on
site, thus minimising total installation time and cost. This also applies for other forms of
relocatable structure. Additionally, other advantages include that the ground screws 10 and
connectors 20 are relocatable and reusable, using ground screws removes the need for
expensive site remediation, and the use of ground screws and connectors minimises the
amount of ground preparation work required with resultant decrease in civil costs.
[0037]                  A further advantage of the invention is that it negates the need for anchoring
with support lines for wind. In the preferred embodiment, the ground screw 10 and
connector 20 combination provides an appropriately rated connection between the
relocatable structure and the bedrock below ground such that uplift generated from strong
wind conditions can be countered.
[0038]                  If during the installation of the ground screws the ground conditions result in
the required pull force not being able to be achieved, remedial action can be taken. This
may include removing the ground screw, filling the hole with a binding material and
reinstalling, or reinstalling the screw in an alternate position. In the event that an alternate
position is required, an alternative form of ground screw connector 20 may be used.
[0039]                  Referring to Figure 6, an alternative embodiment of the ground screw
connector 20 has an upper component where, instead of a twist lock fitting, there is now a
pinned connector 50. The side walls 31 are now longer in a vertical direction and front and
back plates 52 extend between the side walls 31, with a space 53 left open to provide
access to the shaft 38 and allow installation of the convex washer 40 and nut 42.

                                                            -8
[0040]                  Two pins 55 are removably inserted through respective holes 56 in each of the
front and back plates 52. The pins 55 are held in place by clips 58, however any other
suitable retention device may alternatively be used.
[0041]                  Referring to Figure 7, the relocatable structure, in this case a conveyor module,
is provided with a channel 60 that has a number of holes 61. The channel 60 is sized so
that the connector 20 can fit within the channel 60. The pins 55, which extend beyond the
front and back plates 52 when installed, can be removed then reinserted when the
connector 20 is in position in the channel 60. The pins 55 then extend into the holes 61 on
either side of the connector 20 and thereby attach the connector 20 to the conveyor
module. By providing sufficient holes 61 in the channel 60, the connector 20 can be
attached in one of a plurality of available positions.
[0042]                  Referring to Figure 8, the channel 60 in the conveyor module is provided to be
used as an alternate mounting position in the event that a ground screw 10, which is
normally located at a corner casting 64 of the module, is unable to be used in that position
due to poor ground conditions. If this type of failure occurs, a ground screw 10 will be
placed in the new location at the channel 60 and a connector 20 will be pinned in position
during assembly. This allows ground screws to be used with confidence as a backup
position is available when ground conditions are variable.
[0043]                  It is noted that a mature market exists for ground screws. Variations exist in
screw type and in mounting options on the head, and it will be appreciated that
corresponding changes to the base plate 22 or other components of the ground screw
connector 20 may be appropriate and are considered to fall within the scope of the
invention.
[0044]                  While the connector 20 will normally be mounted on ground screws 10, it may
alternatively be used to support conveyor modules or other relocatable structures on
elevated sections. In this case, the connectors 20 will be bolted to a trestle section and still
be able to provide a similar level of adjustability that will be needed to ensure alignment of
the conveyor module or other structure.
