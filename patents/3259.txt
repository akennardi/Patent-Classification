   FUSOKINES INVOLVING CYTOKINES WITH STRONGLY REDUCED RECEPTOR BINDING
   AFFINITIES
   The present invention relates to a fusion protein comprising at least two cytokines, of which at
   least one is a modified cytokine with a strongly reduced binding affinity to its receptor, or to one
 5 of its receptors. Preferably, both cytokines are connected by a linker, preferably a GGS linker.
   The invention relates further to said fusion protein for use in treatment of diseases.
   Cytokines are small secreted or membrane-bound proteins which play a crucial role in
   intercellular communication. Cytokine binding to its cognate receptor complex triggers a
   cascade of intracellular signaling events that enables the cell to sense and respond to its
10 surroundings according to the needs of the cell, tissue and organ of which it is part of. They
   are characteristically pleiotropic, meaning that they provoke a broad range of responses
   depending on the nature and the developmental state of the target cell. Moreover, some of
   them are highly redundant as several cytokines have overlapping activities, which enable them
   to functionally compensate for mutual loss. Cytokine activities can be autocrine, paracrine or
15 endocrine causing a faint boundary between the designated term cytokine, peptide hormone
   and growth factor.
   Six different structural classes of cytokines are known: the a-helical bundle cytokines which
   comprises most interleukins, colony stimulating factors and hormones like growth hormone
   and leptin (Nicola and Hilton, 1998) , the trimeric tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family (Idriss and
20 Naismith, 2000), the cysteine knot growth factors (Sun and Davies, 1995), the P-trefoil fold
   group that includes the interleukin-1 family (Murzin et al., 1992), the interleukin 17 (IL-17)
   family (Gaffen, 2011), and the chemokines (Nomiyama et al., 2013).
   Several cytokines have found important clinical applications. Examples include erythropoietin
   (Epo), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferons a2 and -p, and growth
25 hormone. Conversely, often as a consequence of their pro-inflammatory nature, antagonizing
   selected cytokines also finds specific medical applications. Prime examples here are the
   strategies to block TNFa activity to combat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
   Because of these successes, strategies to optimize cytokine activities in the clinic are being
   explored. These include optimized half-life, reduced immunogenicity, targeted delivery to
30 specific cell types and genetic fusions of two cytokines, so-called fusokines.
   Fusokines are artificial combinations of two different cytokines which are genetically linked
   using a linker sequence. The first example of a fusokine is plXY321 or pixykine which is a
   fusion protein of granulocyte-macrophage         colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) and IL-3
   (Donahue et al., 1988) that showed superior hematopoietic and immune effects compared to
                                               la

   either cytokine alone. This effect could be explained by enhanced binding to their respective
   receptor complexes. Of note, both receptors share the signaling Pc subunit, precluding
   synergistic effects at the signal transduction level. In a Phase III clinical trial, pIXY321 did not
   show superior properties when compared to GM-CSF alone (O'Shaughnessy et al., 1996).
 5 GM-CSF-based fusokines with cytokines of the IL-2 family were explored as well. These
   cytokines all signal through receptor complexes comprising the yc subunit. Examples of such
   fusokines with GM-CSF include IL-2 (Stagg et al., 2004), IL-15 (Rafei et al., 2007) and IL-21
   (Williams et al., 2010a), aka as GIFT2, -15 and -21. Synergistic effects could be expected both
   at the signaling level (i.e. synergistic effects within a target cell) and cellular level (i.e.
10 synergistic effects between different target cell types). For example, GIFT2 induced more
   potent activation of NK cells compared to the combination of the unfused cytokines
   (Penafuerte et al., 2009) and GIFT15 induced an unanticipated, potent immune-suppressive B
   cell population (Rafei et al., 2009a). Likewise, GIFT21 exerted unexpected proinflammatory
   effects on monocytic cells (Williams et al, 2010b). Another example of a fusokine that
15 combines a-helical cytokines is IL-2/IL-12 (Gillies et al., 2002; Jahn et al, 2012).
   Another class of fusokines combines cytokines from different structural families. Examples
   include the fusion of IL-1 8 (a member of the IL-1 cytokine family) and IL-2 (Acres et al., 2005)
   and the fusion between IL-18 and EGF (epidermal growth factor). Since overexpression of the
   EGFR is often observed on certain tumor cell types, the latter fusokine offers the possibility to
20 target the IL-18 activity to EGFR+ tumor cells (Lu et al., 2008). Fusions between a-helical
   bundle cytokines and chemokines were also explored in greater detail. Chemokines often act
   using concentration gradients to steer migration of immune cells to sites of infection and
   inflammation. Many chemokine receptors display a restricted expression pattern allowing
   targeting to selected (immune) cells. Moreover, signaling via the serpentine, G-protein coupled
25 chemokine receptors is fundamentally different from pathways activated by the a-helical
   bundle cytokine receptor complexes and synergetic positive and negative cross-talk
   mechanisms could be expected. Of note, designed N-terminally truncated versions of
   chemokines can retain their receptor binding properties but display antagonistic behavior. An
   example is a fusokine between GM-CSF and a N-terminally truncated CCL2 lacking the first 5
30 N-terminal amino-acids, aka GMME1 (Rafei et al., 2009b). This fusokine induced the apoptosis
   of inflammatory CCR2+ cells and mice treated with GMME1 displayed reduced experimentally
   induced autoimmune disease scores including EAE and CIA for multiple sclerosis (Rafei et al.,
   2009b) and rheumatoid arthritis (Rafei et al., 2009c), respectively. Likewise, this fusokine
   induced apoptosis of CCR2+ tumor cells (Rafei et al., 2011).
35 However, fusions between a wild-type cytokine and a mutant cytokine with strongly reduced
   affinity for its cognate receptor complex were not explored before. The advantage of this
                                                    2

   approach is that the possible systemic toxicity of the wild type cytokine is eliminated.
   Surprisingly, we found that such fusokines allow cell-specific targeting of cytokine activities
   whereby such mutant cytokine can regain its activity on the targeted cells, without the negative
   effect of wild type cytokines. The general applicability of the principle has been demonstrated
 5 using three fusokines each composed of two cytokines from structurally different cytokine
   classes, as exemplified below.
   XCL I / IFNa2-mutant
   XCL1 is a 93 amino acids chemokine secreted by CD8' T cells, Th1 cell-polarized CD4* T cells
   and NK cells. It interacts with XCR1, a chemokine receptor exclusively expressed by dendritic
10 cells. In mice, XCR1 is expressed in the large majority of splenic CD1 1c' CD8a' dendritic cells
   whereas only a very minor subset of CD8a- dendritic cells expresses this receptor (Dorner et
   al. 2009). XCR1 is a conserved selective marker of mammalian cells (including human cells)
   homologous to mouse CD8a' dendritic cells (Crozat et al. 2010). Interestingly it has been
   shown that the action of type I interferon (IFNa/p) on this dendritic cell subset is critical for the
15 innate immune recognition of a growing tumor in mice (Fuertes et al. 2011).
   Systemic IFNa therapy has considerable toxicity, including side effects such as severe fatigue,
   fever, chills, depression, thyroid dysfunction, retinal disease, hair loss, dry skin, rash, itching
   and bone marrow suppression. It would thus be highly worthwhile to target IFN activity toward
   only the cellular population which should be treated with IFN. For application in antitumor
20 therapies, targeting the population of XCR1-expressing dendritic cells is highly desirable since
   these cells are specialized in antigen cross-presentation (Bachem et al. 2012). Many
   experimental data suggest that the XCR1-expressing dendritic cell population represents the
   key cellular population which must react with type I IFN in the tumor microenvironment in order
   to initiate the immune       responses which     ultimately will  allow tumor destruction        and
25 immunization (Gajewski et al. 2012).
   The human IFNa2-Q124R mutant has a high affinity for the murine IFNAR1 chain and a low
   affinity for the murine IFNAR2 chain (Weber et al., 1987). It displays a very low activity on
   murine cells and hence represents a prototype of an engineered type I IFN subtype suitable to
   target IFN activity on selected mouse cells (PCT/EP2013/050787).
30
   CCL20/IL1P
   The CC chemokine CCL20, also known as liver and activation-regulated chemokine (LARC),
   macrophage inflammatory protein-3a (MIP-3a) or Exodus-1 is a 96 AA protein that is
   predominantly expressed in liver and lymphoid tissue (Hieshima et al., 1997). Upon secretion,
                                                    3

   CCL20 exerts its activity by binding to the CC chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6), which belongs to
   the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) 1 family (Baba et al., 1997).          CCR6 expression is
   reported on different leukocyte subsets but is best documented for the Th17 cell population
   (Singh et al., 2008). Normal Th17 function is indispensable for protective immunity against a
 5 range of pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Khader et al., 2007), Klebsiella
   pneumoniae (Ye et al., 2001) and Bordetella pertussis (Higgins et al., 2006).
   Potentiating effects of IL-1 P on the expansion and differentiation of different T cell subsets, in
   particular Th17 cells (Sutton et al., 2006; Acosta-Rodriguez et al., 2007; Dunne et al., 2010;
   Shaw et al., 2012) have been firmly established. Among T cell subsets, Th17 cells express the
10 highest levels of the IL-1R and IL-1 plays an important role in Th17 priming. Controlled
   agonistic IL-1 activity could therefore have applications in different physiological/pathological
   processes, where immunostimulatory effects would be desirable. One of the main concerns
   regarding the use of IL-1 in immunostimulatory therapies is however its severe toxicity when
   administered systemically. Thus, when IL-1 action could be confined to a selected cellular
15 population, the toxicity issue might be resolved, which opens up therapeutic perspectives, e.g.
   for the use as a T-cell adjuvant to enhance the response to weak vaccines (Ben-Sasson et al.,
   2011). To specifically target IL-1 mutants to the Th17 cell population, IL-1 variants are used
   that consist of mutant IL-1 fused to a CCL20 targeting moiety. Because activation will be
   confined to CCR6-expressing cells (ie Th17 cells) only, no major systemic toxicity is expected.
20 TNFa / Leptin mutant
   TNFa is a cytokine with a wide range of biological activities including cytotoxicity, regulation of
   immune cells and mediation of inflammatory responses. It is a self-assembling, non-covalently
   bound, homotrimeric type II transmembrane protein of 233 amino acids. TNFa is active as a
   membrane-bound as well as a soluble protein, released from the cell membrane after
25 proteolytic cleavage of the 76 aminoterminal amino acids (presequence) by TNFa converting
   enzyme (TACE, also called ADAM17). It signals through 2 distinct receptors, TNF-R1 (p55)
   and TNF-R2 (p75), both transmembrane glycoproteins with a cystein-rich motif in the ligand
   binding extracellular domain. Despite the extracellular homology, they have distinct
   intracellular domains and therefore signal different TNF activities (Hehlgans & Pfeffer, 2005).
30 We generated a single chain variant (scTNF) that consists of three TNF monomers coupled via
   GGGGS-linkers as described before by Boschert et al., 2010.
   Leptin is a 16kDa adipocytic cytokine involved in a multitude of biological processes, including
   immunity, reproduction, linear growth, glucose homeostasis, bone metabolism and fat
   oxidation, but is best known for its dramatic effect as a satiety signal (Halaas et al., 1995).
35 Because of its effect on immune cells, leptin is also implicated in several auto-immune
                                                   4

   diseases (likuni et al., 2008). Selective targeting of leptin activity may be beneficial for both
   metabolic and immune- or inflammation-related disorders.
   A first aspect of the invention is a fusion protein, comprising at least two cytokines, of which at
   least one cytokine is a modified cytokine that shows a strongly reduced binding activity
 5 towards its receptor, or towards at least one of its receptors, if binding on different receptors is
   possible. A reduced binding affinity, as used here, means that the affinity is less than 50%,
   preferably less than 40%, more preferably less than 30%, more preferably more than 25%,
   more preferably less than 20%, more preferably less than 15%, more preferably less than
   10%, more preferably less than 5%, most preferably less than 1% of the wild type cytokine.
10 "Wild type cytokine" as used here, means the cytokine as it occurs in nature, in the host
   organism. The modification of the cytokine resulting in a reduction in binding affinity can be a
   modification that decreases the activity of the normal wild type cytokine, or it can be a
   modification that increases the affinity of a homologous, non-endogenous cytokine (such as,
   but not limited to a mouse cytokine, binding to a human cytokine receptor). Modifications can
15 be any modification reducing or increasing the activity, known to the person skilled in the art,
   including but not limited to chemical and/or enzymatic modifications such as pegylation and
   glycosylation, fusion to other proteins and mutations. Preferably, the cytokine with reduced
   binding affinity to the receptor is a mutant cytokine. The mutation may be any mutation known
   to the person skilled in the art, including deletions, insertions, truncations or point mutations.
20 Preferably, said mutation is a point mutation or a combination of point mutations. The affinity
   can be measured with any method known to the person skilled in the art. As a non-limiting
   example, the affinity of the ligand towards the receptor can be measured by Scatchard plot
   analysis and computer-fitting of binding data (e.g. Scatchard, 1949) or by reflectometric
   interference spectroscopy under flow through conditions, as described by Brecht et al. (1993).
25 Alternatively, the reduced binding activity can be measured as reduction of the biological
   activity of the mutant ligand compared to the wild type ligand. In a preferred embodiment, said
   biological activity is measured in vitro, using a reporter assay. Such reporter assays depend
   upon the cytokine receptor system used, and are known to the person skilled in the art. As a
   non-limiting example, an IFN-y reporter assay is described by Bono et al (1989) together with
30 the Scatchard analysis. Preferably the biological activity of the mutant is less than 50%,
   preferably less than 40%, more preferably less than 30%, more preferably more than 25%,
   more preferably less than 20%, more preferably less than 15%, more preferably less than
   10%, more preferably less than 5%, most preferably less than 1% of the wild type cytokine
   The modified cytokine is fused to another cytokine, modified or not. Preferably, both cytokines
35 are fused using a linker sequence, preferably a GGS linker, comprising one or more GGS
   repeats. The modified cytokine may be placed in the aminoterminal part of the molecule, or in
                                                     5

the carboxyteminal part; the fusion protein may further comprise other domains such as, but not limited to
a tag sequence, a signal sequence, another cytokine or an antibody.
A cytokine as used here may be any cytokine known to the person skilled in the art, including, but not
limited to cytokines of the a-helical bundle cytokine family, the trimeric tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family
(Idriss and Naismith, 2000), the cysteine knot growth factors (Sun and Davies, 1995), the P-trefoil fold
group that includes the interleukin-1 family (Murzin et al., 1992), the interleukin 17 (IL-17) family (Gaffen,
2011), and the chemokines (Nomiyama et al., 2013). In case of a member of the trimeric TNF family,
preferably a single chain version is used. Such single chain cytokines are known to the person skilled in
the art, and are described, amongst others, by Krippner-Heidenrich et al. (2008)
In one preferred embodiment, said fusion protein is a fusion between XCL1 and a IFNa2-mutant,
preferably a Q124R mutant. In another preferred embodiment, said fusion is a fusion between CCL20 and
an IL1p mutant. Preferably, said IL1p mutant is a Q148G mutant. In still another preferred embodiment,
said fusion is a fusion between TNFa and a leptin mutant. Preferably, said leptin mutant is a selected
from the group consisting of L86S and L86N.
Another aspect of the invention is a fusion protein according to the invention for use as a medicament. In
one preferred embodiment it is a fusion protein according to the invention for use in treatment of cancer.
In another preferred embodiment, it is a fusion protein according to the invention for use in modulation of
the immune response.

   The XCL1 open reading frame was synthesized by PCR from the XCL1-encoding plasmid
   MR200473 (Origen Inc.), using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Diagnostics) and
   the following primers:
   Forward: 5'GGGGGGGAATTCATGAGACTTCTCCTCCTGAC3'
 5 Reverse: 5' GGGGGGTCCGGAGGCCCAGTCAGGGTTATCGCTG3'
   The PCR product was digested by EcoRI and BspEl and substituted to the EcoRI-BspEl
   fragment which encodes the nanobody in the pMET7 SlgK-HA-1R59B-His-PAS-ybbr-IFNA2
   Q124R vector (PCT/EP2013/050787).
   Production of the XCLI / IFNa2-Q124R fusion protein.
10 Hek 293T cells were transfected with the protein fusion construct using the standard
   lipofectamin   method (Invitrogen). 48 hours after the transfection culture medium were
   harvested and stored at -20'C. The IFN activity was assayed on the human HL116 and the
   murine LL171 cell lines as described (Uz6 et al. J. Mol. Biol. 1994) using the purified
   Nanobody GFP-IFNa2-Q124R preparation (described in PCT/EP2013/050787) as a standard.
15 Cloning of IL- 1P / CCL20 fusion proteins.
   A codon-optimized sequence encoding the mature human IL-1          / CCL20 fusion protein was
   generated via gene synthesis (Invitrogen Gene Art). Briefly, a sequence was synthesized in
   which the mature human IL-1p protein, preceded by the SigK leader peptide, and equipped
   with an N-terminal HA, was fused at its C-terminus to a 13xGGS linker sequence, followed by
20 the sequence for mature human CCL20 with a C-terminal HIS tag (Fig. 3).
   IL-1P mutants expected to have reduced binding affinity for the IL-1 R were selected based on
   literature and analysis of published crystal structures of human IL-1p complexed with its
   receptor. Mutations in the hlL-1p moiety were created via site-directed mutagenesis
   (QuickChange, Stratagene) using the mutagenesis primers as indicated in the table:

   Production of IL-1/3-mutant: CCL20 fusion proteins.
   IL-1-CCL20 fusion proteins were produced in HEK293T cells. For small-scale production,
   HEK293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 400000 cells/well in DMEM supplemented with
 5 10% FCS. After 24 hours, culture medium was replaced by medium with reduced serum
   (DMEM/5%FCS) and cells were transfected using linear PEI. Briefly, PEI transfection mix was
   prepared by combining 1 pg expression vector with 5 pg PEI in 160 pl DMEM, incubated for 10
   minutes at RT and added to the wells dropwise. After 24 hours, transfected cells were washed
   with DMEM and layered with 1.5 ml OptiMem/well for protein production.      Conditioned media
10 were recuperated after 48 hours, filtered through 0.45 p filters and stored at -20'C. IL-1p
   content in the conditioned media was determined by ELISA according to the manufacturer's
   instructions (R&D Systems).
   Cloning of the scTNF / Leptin fusion proteins.
   The coding sequences of the wild-type (WT), L86S and L86N leptin were synthesized by PCR
15 from pMet7 plasmids expressing WT Leptin, Leptin L86S or Leptin L86N, respectively, using
   the following primers:
   forward 5'-GCAGATCTGTCGACATCCAGAAAGTCCAGGATGACACC-3',
   reverse 5'-CGATGCGGCCGCACATTCAGGGCTAACATCCAACTGT-3'.
   This introduces a BgIll and a Notl site at the amino and carboxy terminus, respectively, of the
20 leptin coding sequence. The PCR product was digested with Bglll and Notl and cloned into
   pMET7-SlgK-HA-scTNF WT-6xGGS-FLAG (WT scTNF was generated by gene synthesis,
   GeneArt) opened with BgIll and Notl, which reside in between the 6xGGS and FLAG. This
   generated pMET7-SlgK-HA-scTNF WT-6xGGS-mLeptin-FLAG, pMET7-SlgK-HA-scTNF WT
   6xGGS-mLeptin L86S-FLAG and pMET7-SlgK-HA-scTNF WT-6xGGS-mLeptin L86N-FLAG.
25 Production of the scTNF/Leptin fusion proteins.
   HekT cells were transfected with the different fusion protein constructs using the standard
   calcium phosphate precipitation method. 48 hours after the transfection culture mediums were
   harvested and stored at -20'C. The concentration was determined with a commercial hTNFa
   ELISA (DY210, R&D systems).
30 Cell lines
   Hek 293T, HL116 and LL171 cell line were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS.
                                                   9

   Ba/F3-mLR and Ba/F3-mLR-TNFR1ACyt cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with
   10% heat-inactivated FCS and 1O0ng/ml leptin.
   Assays
   Phospho STA TI assay.
 5 Single-cell suspensions were prepared from spleens isolated from C57B11/6 mice. Erythrocytes
   were depleted using red blood cell lysis buffer (Lonza). Splenocytes were treated for 30 min
   with mouse IFNa/3 or XCL1-IFNa2-Q124R fusion protein in RPMI 5% fetal calf serum at 370 C
   and then labelled with the BD Phosflow PE mouse anti-STAT1 (pY701) together with the Alexa
   Fluor 488-labelled anti-mouse CD11c (eBioscience #53-0114-80) and APC-labelled anti
10 mouse CD8a (BD Bioscience #553035) or anti-mouse CD11c and Alexa 488-labelled anti
   mouse CD8a according to BD Biosciences instructions. FACS data were acquired using a BD
   FACS Canto and analyzed using either Diva (BD Biosciences) software.
   NF-KB reportergene assay.
   To assess IL-1R activation, we used HEK-BlueTM IL-10 cells that stably express the IL-1R
15 (Invivogen) and transfected them transiently with an NF-KB luciferase reportergene. Briefly,
               TM
   HEK-Blue       IL-1p cells were seeded in culture medium (DMEM/10%FCS) in 96-well plates
   (10000 cells/well) and transfected the next day using the calciumphosphate precipitation
   method with the indicated amounts of expression plasmids and 5 ng/well of the 3KB-Luc
   reportergene plasmid (Vanden Berghe et al., 1998). 24 hours post-transfection, culture
20 medium was replaced by starvation medium (DMEM) and 48 hours post-transfection, cells
   were induced for 6 hours with IL1-CCL20 fusion proteins. After induction, cells were lysed and
   luciferase activity in lysates was determined using the Promega Firefly Luciferase Assay
   System on a Berthold centro LB960 luminometer.
   Cell proliferation assay.
25 The Ba/F3-mLR cell line was generated by electroporation of Ba/F3 cells with the pMet7-mLR
   vector. Stably expressing cells were selected by growing them on leptin instead of IL-3.
   Indeed, growth of Ba/F3 cells is dependent on IL-3, but when they express mLR, they also
   proliferate with leptin. To obtain the Ba/F3-mLR-TNFR1ACyt cell line, Ba/F3-mLR cells were
   co-transfected    with   pMet7-HA-hTNFR1ACyt       and  plRESpuro2     (Clontech) followed     by
30 puromycin selection and FACS sorting of hTNFR1ACyt-expressing cells.
   To assess cell proliferation, Ba/F3-mLR and Ba/F3-mLR-TNFR1ACyt cells were washed,
   seeded in RPMI/10%iFCS in 96-well plates (10.000 cells/well) and stimulated with the
   indicated amounts of leptin or fusion proteins. Four days later, 50ul XTT (XTT Cell Proliferation
                                                   10

   Kit II, Roche, 11 465 015 001) was added and incubated for 4 hrs before measuring
   absorbance at 450nm.
   Example 1: IFN activity of the XCL1 / IFNa2-Q124R fusion protein is restored on cells
   expressing XCR1.
 5 Mouse splenocytes were treated for 30 minutes with 1 nM XCL1-IFNa2-Q124R or with 10000
   units/ml mouse IFNa/p. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized and stained with an anti-phospho
   STAT1 (PE), anti CD11c (Alexa Fluor 488) and anti CD8a (APC) and analyzed by FACS.
   Figure 2 shows that mouse IFN a/p induced STAT1 phosphorylation in all splenocyte subsets
   analysed. In contrast the XCL1-IFNa2-Q124R fusion protein induced an IFN response only in
10 the majority of cells belonging to the CD1 1c' CD8a' subset and in a minority of cells belonging
   to the CD11c' CD8a- subset. The distribution of the splenocyte subsets responding to the
   XCL1-IFNa2-Q124R fusion protein matches perfectly the expected distribution of XCR1, the
   XCL1 receptor (Dorner et al. 2009).
   Example 2: IL1 activity is restored on cells expressing CCR6
              TM
15 HEK-Blue      IL-1P cells, which stably express the IL-1R, were transiently transfected with an
   NF-KB reportergene plasmid (5 ng/well) and an empty vector or hCCR6 expression plasmid
   (10 ng/well). Mock- and CCR6-transfected cells were next treated for 6 hours with wild type or
   mutant IL1P-CCL20 fusion proteins (25 ng/ml), after which cells were lysed and NF-KB
   reportergene activity was determined.       As evident from Fig. 4A, cells expressing CCR6
20 responded with increased NF-KB reportergene activity to all investigated mutant IL1-CCL20
   fusion proteins as compared to mock-transfected cells. To evaluate the effect of the IL-ip
   Q148G mutant, for which the targeting effect was most apparent, in more detail, mock
                                                  TM
   transfected or CCR6-expressing HEK-Blue             IL-1p cells were treated for 6 hours with
   increasing doses of WT IL-1p or IL-1pQ148G-CCL20 fusion protein. Fig. 4B demonstrates that
25 overexpression of CCR6 increased the activity of the WT IL-1P-CCL20 fusion, but had a
   stronger potentiating effect for the IL-1PQ148G-CCL20 fusion. The targeting effect was most
   prominent when IL1-P-CCL20 was applied to the cells at 12.5 ng/ml (Fig. 4C).
   Example 3: Leptin activity is restored on cells expressing the TNFR
   The proliferation of Ba/F3-mLR and Ba/F3-mLR-TNFRlACyt cells after 4 days of stimulation
30 with the indicated amounts of leptin or the leptin-scTNF fusion proteins was assessed. As
   shown in figure 6A, both cell lines do not proliferate in growth medium supplemented only with
   heat-inactivated serum. Moreover, the ability of leptin to induce Ba/F3 proliferation is reduced
   when it is coupled to scTNF. Mutating L86 within WT leptin into either a serine (L86S) or an
   asparagine (L86N) results in a moderate or a strong reduction of the affinity towards the
                                                    11

   mouse leptin receptor, respectively. This reduction in affinity translates in a 3 versus 10 times
   less potent induction of proliferation of Ba/F3-mLR cells for leptin L86S versus L86N,
   respectively. Additional transfection of Ba/F3-mLR cells with the human TNF-R1 lacking its
   intracellular domain (hTNFR1ACyt) introduces a non-functional receptor, which can function as
 5 a membrane bound extracellular marker. Clearly, the proliferative response upon stimulation
   with the L86S and L86N leptin mutants coupled to scTNF is completely restored in Ba/F3-mLR
   cells that express the hTNFR1ACyt (Figure 6B).
   Example 4: in vivo targeting of an XCR1 expressing cell population
   According to Bachem et al. (Frontiers in Immunology 3, 1-12. 2012), XCR1 expressing cells
10 represent the major part of CD11c+ CD8a+ spleen cell population and a minor part of CD11c+
   CD8a- spleen cell population. C57B11/6 mice were injected iv with the indicated amount of
   XCL1-IFNa2-Q124R or with 1 000 000 units of natural murine IFNa/Q or PBS. After 45 min,
   spleen cells were analyzed by FACS for P-STAT1 in the following cell population: CD11 c
   CD8a-, CD11c- CD8a+, CD11c+ CD8a+, CD11c+ CD8a- . The results are shown in Figure 7.
15 From these results, it is clear that the fusion construct can target and induce a response in a
   minor fraction of the population (about 0.1% of the total cells), whereas the IFN sensitive cells
   that do not express the marker are not affected. Indeed, wild type IFN is also affecting the
   CD11c+ CD8a- cells, whereas those cells are not affected by the fusion construct, clearly
   proving the specific action of the fusion.
