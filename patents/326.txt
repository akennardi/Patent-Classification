This application is associated with Australian Provisional Patent Application No. <removed-apn>
entitled "A Sport Ball" filed on 24 November 2016, the contents of which are to be taken as
incorporated herein by this reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
The present disclosure relates generally to a sport ball and a process for manufacturing the same.
An embodiment of the sport ball may be used for a sports game, such as cricket (outdoor and
indoor), and other indoor and/or outdoor sports games.
BACKGROUND
 [0001] In relation to the sport of cricket, it will be understood that traditional cricket balls
include "four-piece" balls and "two-piece balls. A four piece ball includes an outer shell
comprised of four quarters of leather, or a suitable synthetic material, which are stitched together
to enclose an inner core and create a spherical cricket ball, whereas a two-piece ball includes an
outer shell comprised of two segments of leather, or a suitable synthetic material, which are each
pressed or otherwise formed, into approximately a hemispherical shape before being stitched
together.
 [0002] In four-piece cricket balls, two of the four quarters are stitched together via a so-called
"hidden" seam (i.e. a seam including stitches which are not visible externally) to form
approximately a hemisphere shaped cover. The resulting two hemispherical shaped covers are
then stitched together along a "main" seam to join the covers together and enclose the core and
create the spherical cricket ball. The hidden seams and the main seam are traditionally
perpendicular with respect to each other.
 [0003] In the case of a two-piece ball, two hemispherical segments are also joined (for example,
stitched) to enclose the core and create the spherical cricket ball. Two-piece balls have a main
seam similar to four-piece balls, but no hidden seam. Rather than being made up of quarters
joined by hidden seams, two-piece balls are made of two larger pieces of leather pressed into
hemispheres.
 [0004] For both two-piece and four-piece balls, the two approximately hemispherical covers that
encase the core and are joined via the main seam using thread(s) stitched around their periphery.
The main seam is made using one or more lines of stitches, usually not more than three, which are
stitched along the periphery of the two hemispherical leather covers to join them tightly and

                                                   2
robustly. The resulting ball has a slightly raised seam area at the intersection of the two flexible
leather cover elements.
[0005] In a four-piece cricket ball, the hidden seam generates a thin boundary layer of air
adjacent to the ball's outer surface that flows in a turbulent manner. The turbulence energizes the
boundary layer and helps move a flow separation point further backward, causing the boundary
layer to remain attached further along the ball's outer surface. This effect reduces lift and drag on
the two sides of the ball, thereby suppressing swing. This swing suppression is an important
functional and performance parameter that helps regulate the balance of the contest between
batsman and bowler. Without it, there can often be an imbalance in favour of the swing bowler.
[0006] Although the inclusion of the hidden seam imparts useful aerodynamic properties, in four
piece balls, the hidden seam may allow water ingress (which may make the ball heavy in wet
conditions) and create a potential point of localised weakness at the four points where the
stitching of the central/main seam and hidden seams meet.
[0007] It would be desirable to provide a two-piece ball which has similar aerodynamic
properties to a four piece ball, but which overcomes at least some of the above described
disadvantages of a four piece ball.
SUMMARY
 [0008] According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a sport ball
including:
         a sphere having an exterior surface, the exterior surface including an equatorial region
segmenting a first hemispherical segment a second hemispherical segment of the sphere; and
         a groove formed in a portion of the exterior surface associated with the first
hemispherical segment and/or in a portion of the exterior surface associated with the second
hemispherical segment such that the or each groove extends substantially along a bisector of the
respective hemispherical segment.
 [0009] Before continuing, it is to be noted that references to a groove being "formed in a portion
of an exterior surface" are to be understood to denote an elongate depression which is formed in
the exterior surface as distinct from a depression resulting fromjoining two surfaces. A groove
may be formed in the exterior surface by any suitable means, such as by engraving, slicing,
cutting, or engraving the exterior surface. A groove may include a continuous groove or a
discontinuous groove including a series of spaced apart depression arranged linearly.

                                                   3
[0010] In an embodiment not intended to replicate the aerodynamic performance of a four-piece
cricket ball, but which may be intended to provide an exaggerated or different aerodynamic
performance, it is possible that the groove may not be linear, but may instead have, for example, a
curved (eg. sinusoidal), zig-zag, saw tooth, or a square pattern type arrangement. Similarly, it is
possible that some embodiments may include one or more grooves having a width or depth which
varies over the length extent of the respective groove.
[0011] The sphere may be of single piece or multiple piece construction. One example of a
single piece construction is a solid sphere configured to replicate the general appearance of a
traditional cricket ball. A suitable solid sphere may include a solid resilient sphere such as a
polymer or rubber sphere.
[0012] In an embodiment having a multiple piece construction, the sphere may include an inner
core and an outer shell about the core. In one embodiment having a multiple piece construction,
the inner core includes a layered inner core and the outer shell is formed from the first
hemispherical segment and the second hemispherical segment. In such an embodiment each
hemispherical segment may be formed from a single piece of a suitable material, such as a leather
or suitable synthetic material.
[0013] One example of sphere having a multiple piece construction is a two-piece cricket ball. It
will be understood by a skilled person that a two-piece cricket ball includes an outer shell
comprised of two hemispherical segments of a suitable material, such as leather, which are
pressed into approximately a hemispherical shape about a layered inner core.
[0014] In an embodiment including an outer shell formed from the first hemispherical segment
and the second hemispherical segment, the equatorial region segmenting the first hemispherical
region of the exterior surface and the second hemispherical region includes a seam joining the
first hemispherical segment and the second hemispherical segment. The seam may include two or
more circumferentially extending rows of stitches which project from the exterior surface.
[0015] In an embodiment, the groove may be formed as a laser engraved groove. In a two-piece
ball embodiment including leather hemispherical regions, an advantage of a laser engraved
groove is that a laser may cauterize the leather as it forms the groove. Cauterisation may provide
improved resistance to water ingress and/or improve the resiliency of the groove compared to a
groove formed using a mechanical tool.
[0016] An additional advantage of a laser engraved groove is that it may enable for more precise
control of the width and depth of the groove compared to a mechanical tool formed groove.

                                                  4
Despite the advantages of a laser engraved groove it is nevertheless possible that a suitable
groove may be formed by mechanically engraving the groove using a suitable tool or machine.
One example of a suitable tool includes a computer numerically controlled (CNC) oscillating
knife. Another example of a suitable tool includes a mechanical engraving tool.
[0017] In an embodiment including a first groove formed in the portion of the exterior surface
associated with the first hemispherical segment and a second groove formed in the portion of the
exterior surface associated with the second hemispherical segment, each groove may extend along
a respective bisector in a plane which is perpendicular to the plane of the equatorial region and to
each other.
[0018] In embodiments, the or each groove has a width in the range of 0.1 mm to 1.0 mm,
including 0.2 mm, 0.3 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.6 mm, 0.7 mm, 0.8 mm and 0.9 mm, and a depth
in the range of 0.1 mm to 1.0mm, including 0.2 mm, 0.3 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.6 mm, 0.7 mm,
0.8 mm and 0.9 mm.
[0019] In an embodiment, the or each groove does not intersect the seam. For example in an
embodiment, the or each groove includes distal first and second ends, and a gap exists between
each of the first and second ends and a respective portion of the equatorial region intersected by
the bisector. In an embodiment, each gap is in the range of 1 mm to 5 mm, including 2 mm,
3mm, and 4 mm.
[0020] Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a method of manufacturing a sport ball,
including:
         providing a sphere having an exterior surface, the exterior surface including an equatorial
region segmenting a first hemispherical segment a second hemispherical segment of the sphere;
and
         forming a groove in a portion of the exterior surface associated with the first
hemispherical segment and/or in a portion of the exterior surface associated with the second
hemispherical segment such that the or each groove extends substantially along a bisector of the
respective segment.
[0021] Embodiments of the present invention may provide a two-piece cricket ball having a
similar aerodynamic performance to a four-piece cricket ball.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0028] Referring initially to Figure 1A and Figure 1B, there is generally shown a sport ball 10
("the ball") for playing sport. In the present case, the ball 10 is a ball suitable for playing the
sport of cricket. However, it will be appreciated that embodiments of the disclosure may be
suitable for other sports.
[0029] In relation to the sport of cricket, it will be understood that cricket balls include "four
piece" balls and "two-piece" balls. A four piece ball includes an outer shell comprised of four
quarters of leather stitched together to enclose the core and create a spherical cricket ball, whereas
a two-piece ball includes an outer shell comprised of two segments of leather which are pressed
into approximately a hemispherical shape. In the case of a two-piece ball, the two hemispherical
segments are joined (for example, stitched) to enclose the core and create the spherical cricket
ball.
[0030] In the present case the ball 10 will be described in terms of a two-piece cricket ball
having an outer shell comprised of two hemispherical segments of leather. However, it will be
appreciated that in some embodiments a single piece construction may be used, such as a ball
including a sphere of a solid polymer or rubber construction. For example, in some embodiments,
the ball may include a polymer sphere including features which replicate the general appearance
of a cricket ball. In such an embodiment, the sphere may have an exterior surface including an
equatorial region which replicates the appearance of a seam, but which is not a seam. In other
words, some embodiments of the present invention may include a seam replication.

                                                    6
[0031] Returning now to Figure IA and IB, the illustrated ball 10 includes a sphere 12 having an
exterior surface 14, the exterior surface including an equatorial region 16 (ref. Figure IB)
segmenting a first hemispherical segment 18A a second hemispherical segment 18B of the sphere
12. In the present case, the equatorial region 16 includes a seam 30 including a raised region and
stitches extending circumferentially about the periphery of the ball 10.
[0032] In the illustrated embodiment, a first groove 22A is formed in a portion of the exterior
surface 14 associated with the first hemispherical segment 18A and a second groove 22B is
formed in a portion of the exterior surface 14 associated with the second hemispherical segment
18B such the ball 10 includes two grooves 22A, 22B. As is shown, each groove 22A, 22B extends
substantially along a respective bisector (ref. Figure IA, lines A-A and B-B) of the respective
hemispherical segment 18A, 18B (ref. Figure 1B) so as to be aligned perpendicularly to the seam
30 and each other. With reference now to Figure IB, in the present case, the bisector for
hemispherical segment 18A is shown as line A-A, whereas the bisector for hemispherical segment
18B is shown as line B-B.
[0033] Although in the present case the illustrated ball 10 includes two grooves 22A, 22B, in
other embodiments it is possible that a sport ball according to an aspect of the disclosure may
include a single groove formed in either the portion of exterior surface 14 associated with the first
hemispherical segment 18A or the portion of the exterior surface associated with the second
hemispherical region 18B of the exterior surface 14.
[0034] In this respect, it may be desirable to provide a ball 10 having a single groove (such as
only grove 22A or only groove 22B) so as to provide a ball 10 having aerodynamic properties
which provide particular characteristics in flight, such as a particular "swing" characteristic. It
will be understood that the term "swing" denotes a reference to a characteristic of a cricket ball's
trajectory in flight which involves the ball curving in the air so as to deviate laterally. Such
deviation is typically referred to as either "in swing" or "out swing". In this respect, a ball which
has a single groove may provide enhance swing characteristics and thus may be useful, for
example, for training and/or sports practice, such as to train a cricket batsman to respond to
swing.
[0035] Returning again now to Figure IA, in the illustrated embodiment the ball 10 includes an
outer shell 28 formed from the first hemispherical segment 18A and the second hemispherical
segment 18B, and the equatorial region 16 segmenting the first hemispherical segment 18A and
the second hemispherical segment 18B. In the present case, the seam 30 joins the first
hemispherical 18A segment and the second hemispherical segment 18B. The seam 30 shown

                                                    7
here includes six circumferentially extending rows of stitches 32 which project from the exterior
surface 14.
[0036] In the illustrated embodiment, each groove 22A, 22B is a laser engraved groove formed
using a laser suitable for forming a groove in the outer shell 28 material, such as leather. One
example of a suitable laser is a CO 2 (red) laser having suitable power and wavelength
characteristics for engraving leather. It will be appreciated that lasers having different
wavelength and power characteristics may be selected for forming a groove in other material
types.
[0037] In the present case, each groove 22A, 22B is formed in a respective portion of the exterior
surface 14 to provide a groove width of 0.5 mm and a groove depth of 0.5 mm.
[0038] As shown in Figure IA to Figure 3, each groove 22A, 22B has a length which extends
between a first end 36 and a second end 38 of the respective groove 22A, 22B. As shown in
Figure 2, in the present case, the length of each groove 22A, 22B is such that a gap 40 is provided
between the first end 36 and a respective outermost 42A circumferentially extending row of
stitches 32, and between the second end 38 and the respective other outermost 42B
circumferentially extending row of stitches 32. Consequently, each groove 22A, 22B does not
intersect the seam 30.
[0039] In the present case, each gap 40 is about 5 mm. That is, in the present case, the distance
between the first end 36 and the respective outer most 42A, 42B circumferentially extending row
of stitches 32, or between the second end 38 and the respective outer most 42A, 42B
circumferentially extending row of stitches 32, is about 5 mm.
[0040] In relation to a two-piece cricket ball, an advantage of providing the gaps 40 is that this
arrangement is less likely to provide a localised weakness in the integrity of the outer shell 28
material proximal to the equatorial region 16 (that is, the seam 30), as compared to a localised
weakness which may otherwise result from a reduction in material bulk which would otherwise
be caused if the groove 22A, 22B was to intersect the seam 30. Such a localised weakness may
lead to premature degradation of the seam 30 in use. By providing the gaps 40, the integrity of
the seam 30 may be preserved for a longer period of use.
[0041] Embodiments of the present disclosure also relate to a method of manufacturing a sport
ball 10, including providing a sphere having an exterior surface, the exterior surface including an
equatorial region segmenting a first hemispherical segment a second hemispherical segment of
the sphere; and forming a groove in a portion of the exterior surface associated with the first

                                                    8
hemispherical segment and/or a portion of the exterior surface associated with the second
hemispherical segment such that the or each groove extends substantially along a bisector of the
respective hemispherical segment.
[0042] Turning now to Figures 4A to 4D, the steps in an example manufacturing process for
producing a ball 10 according to an aspect of an embodiment may involve:
     "   Locating a two-piece cricket ball 10 in a jig 50 so as to hold the ball 10 securely for
         rotation about a first axis of rotation 52 extending through the seam 30. Such an
         arrangement will leave the majority of the ball 10 accessible to laser 54. In preference the
         jig 50 is configured to enable the ball 10 to be rotated around the first axis of rotation 52
         in a direction perpendicular to the seam 30, at a controllable speed (as required to suit the
         laser wavelength and power and provide a groove having a desired width and depth)
         through at least 160 degrees. It will be appreciated that the actual angular extent of the
         rotation may vary depending on the width of the seam 30 with the requirement being that
         the groove does not intersect the seam 30.
     "   Positioning the laser 54 relative to the supported ball 10 and operating the laser 54 whilst
         rotating the ball 10 about an axis of rotation 52 to form a first groove 22A having a length
         which does not intersect any of the six rows of seam 30 stitching around the ball 10 (ref.
         Figure 4A).
     *   Repositioning the ball 10 in the jig 50 so as to rotate the ball 10 90-degrees about the
         seam 30 in the plane of the axis of rotation 52 (ref. Figure 4B).
     *   Operating the laser 54 whilst rotating the ball 10 about the axis of rotation 52 to form a
         second groove 22B having a length which does not intersect the seam 30 around the ball
          10 and which is aligned perpendicularly to the seam 30 and the first groove 22A (ref.
         Figure 4C and Figure 4D).
 [0043] The resulting laser engraved grooves 22A, 22B are thus perpendicular to the seam 30 of
the ball 10 and to each other.
[0044] Embodiments of the present disclosure may provide balls having a desired aerodynamic
characteristic, such as enhanced or attenuated swing. Furthermore, in relation to a two-piece
cricket ball, embodiments may provide a groove having more precise dimensional characteristics
and improved dimensional stability as compared to the hidden seam of a four-piece ball. Such

                                                    9
improved stability may provide improved consistency of performance from ball to ball than
hidden seams.
[0045] It is possible that embodiments of a sport ball according to an aspect of the disclosure
may comprise a set of balls, with each ball in the set including a groove, or a pair of grooves,
which are configured to impart different aerodynamic characteristics. In this way, a particular
one of the balls may be selected according to weather conditions and/or desired swing
characteristics.
[0046] Throughout the specification and the claims that follow, unless the context requires
otherwise, the words "comprise" and "include" and variations such as "comprising" and
"including" will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers, but
not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.
[0047] The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as, an
acknowledgement of any form of suggestion that such prior art forms part of the common general
knowledge.
[0048] It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention is not restricted in its
use to the particular application described. Neither is the present invention restricted in its
preferred embodiment with regard to the particular elements and/or features described or depicted
herein. It will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the embodiment or embodiments
