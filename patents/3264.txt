   Field
15 The present invention relates to an environment
   controller, an environment control system and an
   environment control method.
   Background
20
   Gaming venues employ heating, ventilation and air
   conditioning  (HVAC) systems to control the environment
   within a gaming venue. Such HVAC systems vary in level of
   sophistication from manually controlled systems to systems
25 which control the environment based on complex user
   settings and feedback from sensors disposed around the
   venue.
   Controlling the environment in a gaming venue provides
30 particular challenges, for example, the heat load in a
   particular part of the venue may vary markedly depending
   on the number of patrons and/or the number of active
   gaming machines.
35 Accordingly, there is a need for an alternative
   environment control system for gaming venues.

   Detailed Description
30
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown an environment
   control system for a venue. In the embodiment, the venue
   is a gaming venue such as a casino or the like.
35 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that some
   venues have electronic gaming tables playable by a
   plurality of players. For the purpose of this
                                            10015706_1 (GHMatters) P84785.AU.2 23/02/18

   specification, a player position at such a table should be
   understood as being within the meaning of "a gaming
   device". Accordingly, within this specification "gaming
   device" encompasses, for example, a single player,
 5 electronic gaming machine arranged to play one or more
   resident games, a player position at a gaming table, and
   an interactive video gaming terminal in a server based
   gaming system.
10 A typical stand alone gaming machine 10 is illustrated in
   Figure 1. The gaming machine 10 includes a console 12
   having a display 14 on which is displayed representations
   of a game that can be played by a player.     A mid-trim 20
   of the gaming machine 10 houses a bank of buttons 22 for
15 enabling a player to interact with the gaming machine, in
   particular during game play.  The mid-trim 20 also houses
   a credit input mechanism for example a coin input chute
   and/or a bill collector 24B.  Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
20 reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.
   Artwork and/or information, for example pay tables and
   details of bonus awards and other information or images
25 relating to the game may be provided on a front panel 29
   of the console 12.  A coin tray 30 is mounted beneath the
   front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts from the gaming
   machine 10.
30 The display 14 shown in Figure 1 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.  Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
35 electromechanical device.  The top box 26 also includes a
   display which may be of the same type as the display 14,
   or of a different type.
                                            10015706_1 (GHMatters) P84785.AU.2 23/02/18

                                - 8
   A player marketing module   (PMM) 50 having a display 52 is
   connected to the gaming machine 10.    The main purpose of
   the PMM 50 is to allow the player to interact with a
 5 player loyalty system.    The PMM has a magnetic card reader
   for the purpose of reading a player tracking device in the
   form of a magnetic swipe card, for example as part of a
   loyalty program.   However other reading devices may be
   employed and the player tracking device may be in the form
10 of a card, flash drive or any other portable storage
   medium capable of being read by a reading device.
   Figure 2 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
15 different to the gaming machine of Figure 1.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102.    Instructions and data to control
   operation of the processor 102 are stored in a memory 103,
20 which is in data communication with the processor 102.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:              a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
25 or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   Typically, the gaming machine 100 will include both
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
30 type of memory, with such memories being collectively
   represented by the memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
35 player credit, an input/output   (I/O) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
                                              10015706_1 (GHMatters) P84785.AU.2 23/02/18

                               -  9
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
 5 random numbers for use by the processor 102.           Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 2,   a player interface 120
10 includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 has one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen 107, a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
15 included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
20 communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a central controller, server or database and receive
   data or commands from the central controller, server or
25 database.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                 The RAM
30 103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                 The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.    The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
35 integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
                                              10015706_1 (GHMatters) P84785.AU.2 23/02/18

                               -  10
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
 5 provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 4 is a block diagram of a player marketing module
   50.   The player marketing module 50 is connected via
   input/output port 57 to a serial input output port of the
10 input/output section 105 of the electronic gaming machine.
   The player marketing module has a card reader 54 and a
   display 52 which may be a touch screen display.               The PMM
   50 may also have buttons 53 for receiving a player input
    (at least in embodiments where there is no touch screen
15 display) and a speaker 51.    Input received from the card
   reader 54 is processed by processor 55 based on the data
   stored in memory 56.   The PMM 50 is connected to the
   loyalty system by a network card 58. Thus, in the
   embodiment, the gaming machine 10 communicates with the
20 venue management system via the PMM as described in
   further detail below.   The venue management system may
   incorporate a player tracking system or the PMM may also
   communicate with a separate player tracking system.
   Processor 55 is also arranged to communicate with a gaming
25 machine 10.
   Figure 5 shows a series of electronic gaming machines 10
   connected via respective player marketing modules 50 over
   a communications network 510 to an environment management
30 controller 520 and a venue management system 540.                  The
   communications network 510 may be any suitable
   communications network for example an Ethernet.
   Also shown as connected in the communication network in
35 Figure 5 are a plurality of controllable devices 580 and a
   plurality of sensors 590.    Persons skilled in the art will
   appreciate that such sensors and controllable devices may
                                              10015706_1 (GHMatters) P84785.AU.2 23/02/18

                               - 11
   not be connected via a network.   For example, in other
   embodiments, they may be connected directly to the
   environment controller or to a control panel.
   Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the particular
 5 form of connection shown in Figure 5 is for illustrative
   purposes.   A user terminal 530 is connected to the
   environment controller 520 in order to alter settings of
   the environment controller 520.
10 Figure 6 shows one embodiment of an environment controller
   520.   In the embodiment, the environment controller is
   implemented by a processor 620 executing program code
   stored in memory 640.   The memory 640 is also used to
   store the current parameters 641 of the controllable
15 devices.   In this respect, the controllable devices can be
   any suitable heating, ventilation or air-conditioning
   units.   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   some embodiments, a single device may provide all of
   heating, ventilation and air-conditioning.        In other
20 embodiments, there may be separate heating and air
   conditioning plants, connected via a series of ducts to
   the venue which may be used to provide a combination of
   heating, cooling, or their circulation.   To control these
   controllable devices 580, the processor 620 implements a
25 device controller 621 with sub-modules 621A, 621B, 621N
   for each of N devices which are controlled.
   The device controller 621 controls the controllable
   devices based on device parameters 641 stored in the
30 memory.   The user terminal 530 is used to set normal
   device parameters.   For example, by setting desired
   temperatures.   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
   that there might be other interfaces rather than the user
   computer, for example a control panel where a user can
35 specify a desired temperature.   A person skilled in the
   art will also appreciate that there may be more
   sophisticated control parameters, for example allowing
                                             10015706_1 (GHMatters) P84785.AU.2 23/02/18

                              - 12
   parameters to be set for particular times of day etc.                       The
   control sub-modules 621A, 621B, 621N, translate these
   higher level settings into more specific device
   parameters, such as fan speed or heating level.
 5
   The device controller comprises a control determiner 622
   which determines whether the control of the devices should
   be adjusted.  For example, whether changes to the control
   of any device 580 should be made based on sensor monitor
10 624 which provides any feedback from sensors disposed
   around the venue.  For example, the sensor may report the
   current temperature at a location within the venue
   allowing the control determiner 622, compare the current
   temperature to the parameter stored in the memory and
15 control one of the N controllable devices 621 so that the
   temperature approaches the desired temperature.
   In the embodiment, the environment controller is also
   arranged to obtain feedback from players within the venue
20 regarding how they perceive the environment.
   In one embodiment, players input to the system can be
   elicited actively through a pushout "survey" to all or a
   selected number of players.   To this end, a feedback
25 prompter 626 sends out a survey based on prompt conditions
   643 stored in memory.  Depending on the embodiment, such a
   survey may be scheduled to occur at a regular interval;
   may be sent out based upon a pre-configured trigger in the
   associated gaming management system, for example, when a
30 number of players reaches a threshold;  may be sent out
   based on an unusual temperature change being detected; may
   be sent out based on an outdoor temperature etc.                In the
   preferred embodiment, the survey, is communicated to the
   PMM 50 and displayed on display 52.   The survey would give
35 the player three options such as "I am too hot",             "I am
   fine", or "I am too cold" and the player would be able to
   either touch the displayed message on a touch screen
                                             10015706_1 (GHMatters) P84785.AU.2 23/02/18

                              -  13
   display or touch an associated button.   Persons skilled in
   the art will appreciate that different messages can be
   used or level of granularity can be provided, for example
   five options instead of three.   In an alternative
 5 embodiment, players may be able to provide input
   irrespective of whether they have been prompted feedback
   prompter 626.  For example, the player may select a
   provide temperature feedback option displayed on display
   52.  The player could then select from similar options to
10 those described above.
   In one embodiment, once each player provides information,
   this feedback is sent to the venue management system 540.
   The venue management system adds location information
15 based on the gaming machine from which it was received and
   passes the feedback to the environment controller 520
   where it is received by feedback receiver 623.           The
   feedback receiver 623 may store the feedback data in
   memory 644 for later use.   For example, it may be possible
20 to analyse trends in the feedback data in order to make
   adjustments to the controllable device parameters 641.
   The device controller 621 processes the feedback to
   determine whether to make any adjustment to the control
   parameters of any of one of the controllable devices 621A
25 to 621N.  To this end, control determiner 622 applies
   control algorithm 644 stored in memory 640.         The control
   algorithm can vary in levels sophistication.          In one
   embodiment, the control algorithm is applied on a region
   by region basis within the venue; the regions
30 corresponding to a set of one or more controllable
   devices.  In one example, the control algorithm applies a
   numerical value to the conditions of "too hot", "just
   right" and "too cold".  For example, -1  for too hot, 0 for
   just right and +1 for too cold.   The control determiner
35 then determines the average value from machines within the
   location in the venue and for positive values applies
   additional cooling and for negative values applies
                                             10015706_1 (GHMatters) P84785.AU.2 23/02/18

                               - 14
   additional heating.   The amount of additional heating or
   cooling which is applied can be determined based on a
   weighting and the magnitude of the determined values.                        In
   one example, this can be achieved by control determiner
 5 622 storing temporary values of the controllable device
   parameters 641  (e.g. different set temperature points)
   based on the feedback.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that other
10 features may be implemented.    For example, the feedback
   receiver 623 may be arranged to monitor for abnormal
   trends.  For example numerous "too hot" or "too cold"
   votes from a particular area may indicate that a
   controllable device of the environment system is not
15 working and may trigger output of an alert for further
   investigation and/or action.    Similarly, numerous votes
   from a single player may be used to trigger a more
   personalised investigation/response as appropriate.                    For
   example, a venue host could visit the patron to determine
20 whether they require extra clothing.
   A person skilled in the art will appreciate that while the
   embodiment has been described as being implementable in
   relation to PMMs 50, some operators build an interface for
25 accessing additional services into the main game screen.
   For example, a particular button may bring up a menu on
   the main gaming machine display where a player can make
   selections.
30 Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate that while
   a main advantage of the invention can be obtained by
   directly controlling one or more controllable devices, in
   other embodiments,  the feedback  information may be
   gathered, processed and then output, for example on user
35 terminal 530, to enable a user to control a manually
   operable control panel.   For example, such an output could
   be "9 out of 10 patrons in region X report being too
                                              10015706_1 (GHMatters) P84785.AU.2 23/02/18

                               - 15
   cold".
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that other
   control parameters may be used.   For example, Figure 6
 5 shows that the environment controller includes a usage
   receiver 622 which receives usage information about gaming
   machines on the floor.   The usage information may indicate
   how many gaming machines are active as the number of
   machines being used in a particular region of the venue
10 increases, there will be an additional heat load.
   Accordingly, the control determiner 622 may take into
   account the number of active machines.
   In other embodiments, feedback from users is received
15 separately by feedback receiver as opposed with and
   location information is received separately by usage
   receiver 625.   The information is then collated by the
   environment controller 520.
20 Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate that while
   certain functions are shown as being placed within the
   environment controller 520 they could be placed elsewhere.
   For example, the processing of feedback data could be
   performed within the venue management system 540.                 In
25 another example, the venue management systems 540 may be
   responsible for prompting for feedback, and gathering and
   processing that feedback before providing outcomes to the
   environment controller 520.
30 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the
   embodiment provides advantages over existing HVAC systems
   as it enables users to participate in the feedback loop.
   Player comfort is a key factor for players engaged on a
   casino floor.   While modern HVAC systems employ
35 sophisticated sensors, they cannot completely sense how
   players "feel".   Further, configuring a system involves a
   certain amount of guess work in that the temperatures
                                             10015706_1 (GHMatters) P84785.AU.2 23/02/18

                               -  16
   which are set in the system are based on what the person
   responsible for managing the system perceives to be an
   appropriate.   Such estimated temperatures may not always
   be appropriate.   For example, if the manager of the system
 5 ascertains whether the temperature is appropriate by
   walking through the floor of the venue, they may have a
   very different perception of whether the temperature is
   appropriate to a player who sits in front of a gaming
   machine for an extended period of time.    An additional
10 advantage of the embodiment is that it gives players a
   sense of empowerment allowing them to provide feedback on
   the environmental conditions around them.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that such
15 systems can be extended to other environments where it is
   possible to obtain user feedback from a plurality of
   locations within a venue.    For example, via PCs at users'
   desks in a workplace.
20 The method of embodiment is shown in Figure 7.            The method
   involves receiving environment feedback from input devices
   disposed around the venue 710.    The method then involves
   controlling at least one controllable device which
   performs one or more of heating, cooling or ventilation
25 720 based on the received feedback.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system.    It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
30 digitally by a processor.    Persons skilled in the art will
   also appreciate that the method could be embodied in
   program code.   The program code could be supplied in a
   number of ways, for example on a tangible computer
   readable storage medium, such as a disc or a memory                   (for
35 example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as a
   data signal  (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that
                                              10015706_1 (GHMatters) P84785.AU.2 23/02/18

                               - 17
   program code provides a series of instructions executable
   by the processor.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
 5 to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:             a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
10 provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory   and generating outputs  (for example on
   the display).   Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units   (CPUs). Most processors
15 are general purpose units, however, it is also know to
   provide a specific purpose processor, for example, an
   application specific integrated circuit   (ASIC) or a field
   programmable gate array (FPGA).
20 It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
   embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
25 further embodiments.
