    Field of the invention
    The present invention generally relates to gaming machines. A particular embodiment
    of the present invention relates to the provision of sound effects to accompany events
    displayed in a game played on a gaming machine.
15
    Background of the invention
    With the increase of gambling at gaming venues has come increased competition
    between gaming venues to obtain a larger share of the total gambling spend. Gaming
    venue operators have therefore continuously looked for new variations and types of
20  games in order to attract both new and return customers to their venues.
    In response to this need, suppliers of gaming devices and systems have attempted to
    provide the sought-after variety, while still developing games that comply with the
    relevant regulations in the jurisdiction of the gaming venue operator. Suppliers of
25  gaming devices therefore are faced with restrictions on the types of games and gaming
    machines that are allowable, both in terms of the prevailing regulations and in terms of
    providing a return on investment to the gaming venue operators.
    Summary of the invention
30  According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a gaming machine
    comprising:

    Detailed description of the embodiments
    Operating environment
30
    In Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings, one example of a gaming console that is
    suitable to implement the present invention is generally referenced by arrow 114.
    The gaming console 114 includes two displays 106A, 106B on one or both of which is
35  displayed representations of a game that can be played by a player and a bank of
    buttons 107A and/or a touch screen 107B to enable a player to play the game. The
    displays 106 may be video display units, such as a cathode-ray-tube screen device, a
    10352754_1(GHMaters) P88266.AU.4

                                               -4
   liquid crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video display unit, or the visible
   portion of an electromechanical device. The display 106B may display artwork,
   including for example, pay tables and details of bonus awards and other information or
   images relating to the game. In alternative gaming consoles the display 106B may be
 5 omitted, or optionally replaced by a static display.
   The gaming console 114 also includes audio system. In one arrangement the console
   114 includes a left speaker 152 and a right speaker 153. In other arrangements
   additional speakers may be provided on the console 114. Furthermore, other speakers
10 may be disposed around a player of the gaming console 114 to enable the provision of
   surround sound. In the arrangements described herein, the audio system provides
   multi-channel sound and thus different sound channels may be played through the left
   speaker 152 and the right speaker 153. By using two channels, a sound can be
   designed to have dominance in one or other of speakers 152, 153 or to be balanced
15 between both speakers.
   A credit input including a coin input 11 0A and/or bill collector 11 OB allows a player to
   provide credit for wagering and a coin output 111 is provided for cash payouts from the
   gaming console 114. A card and/or ticket reader 108 and a printer 109 may be
20 provided to provide player tracking, cashless game play or other gaming and non
   gaming related functions.
   Figure 2 shows a block diagram of a gaming machine, generally referenced by arrow
   100, suitable for implementing the present invention. The gaming machine 100 may
25 include the gaming console 114 shown in Figure 1 and accordingly like reference
   numerals have been used to describe like components in Figures 1 and 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101, which in the illustrated
   example includes a computational device 102 that may be a microprocessor,
30 microcontroller, programmable logic device or other suitable device. Instructions and
   data to control operation of the computational device 102 are stored in a memory 103,
   which is in data communication with, or forms part of, the computational device 102.
   Typically, the gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non-volatile memory
   and more than one of each type of memory, with such memories being collectively
35 represented by the memory 103. The instructions to cause the game controller 101 to
   implement the present invention may be stored in the memory 103. The instructions
   and data may be conveyed to the gaming machine by means of a data signal in a
   10352754_1(GHMaters) P88266.AU.4

                                                 -5
    transmission channel. Examples of such transmission channels include network
    connections, the Internet or an intranet and wireless communication channels.
    The game controller 101 may include hardware credit meters 104 for the purposes of
  5 regulatory compliance and also include an input/output (1/0) interface 105 for
    communicating with the peripheral devices of the gaming machine 100. The
    input/output interface 105 and/or the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with
    their own memory for instructions and data.
10  In the example shown in Figure 2, the peripheral devices that communicate with the
    controller are the displays 106, bank of buttons/touch screen 107, the card and/or
    ticket reader 108, the printer 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input 110 and a coin
    output 111. Additional devices may be included as part of the gaming machine 100, or
    devices omitted as required for the specific implementation.
15
    Speakers 152, 153 also communicate with the game controller 101. The controller
    includes a stereo driver operable to drive each of the speakers 152, 153 individually.
    The stereo device driver may be implemented as integrated circuitry with firmware in
    the game controller 101. Alternatively, the stereo driver may be implemented as
20  software code running, for example on the computational device 102. In other
    arrangements the driver is a multi-channel driver that enables more than two channels
    to be output to a plurality of speakers that communicate with the game controller 101.
    The bank of buttons 107A and/or touch screen 107B together with one or both of the
25  displays 106 may provide a user interface 115 through which the gaming machine 100
    and player communicate. If a card/ticket reader 108 is provided, this may also form
    part of the user interface 115.
    In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a communications interface, for
30  example a network card 112. The network card 112, may for example, send status
    information, accounting information or other information to a central controller, server
    or database and receive data or commands from the central controller, server or
    database. The network card 112 may also enable communication with a central player
    account, allowing cashless gaming. One or more of the peripheral devices, for example
35  the card/ticket reader 108 may be able to communicate directly with the network card
    112. The network card 112 and the I/O interface 105 may be suitably implemented as
    a single-machine communications interface.

                                               -6
   The game controller 101 may also include a random number generator 113, which
   generates a series of random numbers that determine the outcome of a series of
   random game events played as part of a game on the gaming machine 100.
 5
   The game controller 101 may have distributed hardware and software components that
   communicate with each other directly or through a network or other communication
   channel. In particular, the game controller 101 may be located in part or in its entirety
   remote from the user interface 115. Also, the computational device 102 may comprise
10 a plurality of devices, which may be local or remote from each other.
   Instructions and data for controlling the operation of the user interface 115 may be
   conveyed to the user interface 115 by means of a data signal in a transmission
   channel. The user interface 115 may be a computational device, for example a
15 personal computer, used by a person to play a game provided from a remote game
   controller 101.
   Figure 3 shows an exemplary block diagram of the main components of the memory
   103. The RAM 103A typically temporarily holds instructions and data related to the
20 execution of game programs and communication functions performed by the
   computational controller 102. The EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or
   may contain system and game-related code. The mass storage device 103C may be
   used to store game programs, the integrity of which may be verified and/or
   authenticated by the computational controller 102 using protected code from the
25 EPROM 103B or elsewhere.
   Figure 4 shows a gaming system 200 in the form of a network of devices. The gaming
   system 200 includes a network infrastructure 201, which for example may be an
   Ethernet network. Alternatively, a wireless network and/or direct communication
30 channels, or a different type of network may be used to link the gaming machines to a
   server, each other and/or other devices. Gaming consoles 114, shown arranged in
   three banks 203 of two gaming consoles 114 in Figure 4, are connected to the network
   infrastructure 201. The gaming consoles 114 may form part or all of a gaming machine
   100. Single gaming consoles 114 and banks 203 containing three or more gaming
35 devices 114 may also be connected to the network infrastructure 201, which may also
   include hubs, routers, bridges to other networks and other devices (not shown).

                                               -7
    One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the network 201. The displays
    204 may, for example, be associated with a bank 203 of gaming consoles 114. The
    displays 204 may be used to display representations associated with game play on the
    gaming devices 202, and/or used to display other representations, for example
  5 promotional or informational material.
    Servers may also be connected to the network 201. For example, a game server 205
    may generate game outcomes for games played on one or more of the gaming
    consoles 114, a database management server 206 may manage the storage of game
10  programs and associated data in a database 206A so that they are available for
    downloading to, or access by, game controllers 101, and a jackpot server 207 may
    control one or more jackpots for the gaming system 200.
    Further servers may be provided to assist in the administration of the gaming system
15  200, including for example a gaming floor management server 208, and a licensing
    server 209 to monitor the use of licenses to particular games. An administrator terminal
    210 is provided to allow an administrator to manage the network 201 and the devices
    connected to the network. The gaming floor management server 208 may act as a
    player tracking server.
20
    The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming systems, other local
    networks, for example a corporate network and/or a wide area network such as the
    Internet through a firewall 211.
25  Providing stereo sound effects for a game
    In the method described below, the stereo driver of the game controller 101 plays
    gaming sounds over left speaker 152 and right speaker 153 to accompany a sequence
    of events in a game played on a machine such as gaming machine 100. The relative
30  volume in the speakers 152 and 153 varies to match the location of the displayed
    gaming events.
    The described example uses spinning reel games. Similar techniques may also be
    used to provide sound effects in other games played on gaming machine 100 such as
35  card games, ball games, dice games and pick and match games. This list is not
    exhaustive. The described methods may be used if the game uses a series of gaming
    events displayed at a sequence of different locations on the displays 106.

                                               -8
    Figure 5 shows a schematic view 300 of a spinning reel game that may be displayed
    on display 106A. In one arrangement five reels 301, 302, 303, 304, 305 are displayed.
    Each of the reels has a series of symbols, of which three are visible in the displayed
  5 view 300 at any time. For example, when reel 305 is stopped, symbols are visible in
    each of cells 310, 312, 314. Originally, gaming machines used physical reels with
    symbols mounted on the reels. Now, typically, electronic displays such as display 106A
    use computer graphics to simulate the spinning of physical reels.
10  Figure 6 shows a flow diagram of a method 400 for providing sound effects for a
    spinning reel game played on gaming console 114. It will be appreciated that the
    process may also be implemented on other gaming systems. The method 400 is
    typically controlled by software running on computational device 102 to control the
    operation of gaming machine 100.
15
    The method 400 commences in step 402, in which the spinning reel game is started.
    Typically, the game controller 101 monitors the bill acceptor and/or coin input 110
    and/or information received by the card/ticket reader 108 or network card 112 for a
    deposit of credit and in response causes the hardware meters 104 to increment
20  according to the denomination of the game. The game controller 101 then monitors the
    user interface 107 for the input of a wager. If there are sufficient credits in the meters
    104 to support the wager, the game controller 101 commences game play.
    In step 404 the reels 301-305 are set spinning. Then, in steps 406-410, the reels are
25  stopped in turn to display 3 symbols each. The outcome of the wagering game
    depends on the specific combinations of symbols that are revealed when the reels
    have stopped.
    Traditionally, the reels 301-305 stop spinning in turn from left to right. Thus, in the first
30  operation of step 406 the left-hand reel 301 stops spinning to display 3 symbols. The
    game has a sound that is used to accompany a reel stopping. In step 408 the
    accompanying sound is retrieved and is played through left speaker 152 and right 20
    speaker 153. The relative volume of the gaming sound played through the left and right
    speakers depends on the location of the reel that has stopped. In the case of reel 301
35  the sound is played predominantly or entirely through the left speaker 152. This is
    illustrated in Figure 7A, which shows 2 sound outputs 501 and 502. In Figure 7, the
    x-axis is time and the y-axis is representative of the volume of sound. Output 501 is
    10352754_1(GHMaters) P88266.AU.4

                                                 -9
    played through the left speaker 152 and output 502 is played through the right speaker.
     It may be seen that little or no sound issues from the right speaker 153. Accordingly, a
    player at the gaming machine 100 will see the left hand reel 301 stopping and hear an
    accompanying gaming sound through the left speaker 152.
  5
    Steps 406 and 408 are coordinated by the controlling software such that the visually
    displayed event and the accompanying sound are temporally associated. A player may
    thus expect to hear the accompanying sound if the spinning reel is stopped. The exact
    time relationship between the displayed event and the sound may be specified by a
10  designer of the game. For example, the sound may immediately precede the event,
    coincide with the event, follow soon after the event or continue for a time span that
    encompasses the display of the event.
    The stereo pair 501, 502 may be retrieved from data storage, for example memory
15   103. Since the location of reel 301 in view 300 is known in advance, the relative
    strength of the respective outputs 501, 502 may be determined in advance and stored
    in sound files for use in association with reel 301. In alternative arrangements, the
    relative strength of the right and left outputs may be determined dynamically as a
    function of the location of a gaming event on the display 106A.
20
     In step 410 the controlling software checks whether there are more reels to stop. As
    there are, control flow returns to step 406, in which reel 302 stops to reveal 3 symbols.
     In step 408 a sound is played through speakers 152, 153 to accompany the stopping of
    reel 302. The sound output is illustrated in Figure 7B. Sound output 503 issues from
25  left speaker 152 and output 504 is played through right speaker 153. The relative
    volumes of outputs 503, 504 favour the left speaker 152.
    The process then loops back to step 406 in which the next reel 303 is stopped to
    display 3 symbols. In step 408 an accompanying sound is played, as illustrated in
30   Figure 7C. Sound output 505 is played through the left speaker 152 and sound output
    503 is played through the right speaker 153. Reel 303 is located in the centre of the
    display 300. Ideally, the sound for reel 303 is heard equally from the left speaker 152
    and the right speaker 153, as seen in Figure 7C.
35  Process flow then returns to step 406 in which the next reel 304 stops. In step 408 an
    accompanying sound is played as illustrated in Figure 7D. In this case, the output 508
    played through right speaker 153 is relatively louder than the output 507 played
    10352754_1(GHMaters) P88266.AU.4

                                                 - 10
    through the left speaker 152.
    Process flow then returns to step 406, in which the final reel 305 is stopped. In step
    408 the accompanying sound is played as shown in Figure 7E. Output 510 is played
  5 through right speaker 153 and predominates over the relatively quiet sound 509 that is
    played through the left speaker 152.
    Step 410 then checks whether there are any more reels. As there are not, process flow
    continues to the remaining steps of the game. These further steps are not shown in
10  Figure 6, but typically relate to determining whether the displayed symbols on the
    stopped reels entitle the player to a prize or bonus feature.
    Figure 8 provides an overview of the sound outputs of speakers 152, 153 as each of
    the reels 301-305 stops in sequence. The output sounds are shown on a consistent
15  scale and illustrate how the output of the left speaker 152 progressively diminishes and
    the output of the right speaker progressively increases as the corresponding reel stops
    on display 300. The stereo pairs 601, 602, 603, 604, 605 may be designed in advance
    and stored in data storage such as memory 103. The appropriate stereo pair 601-605
    may be retrieved from data storage to accompany a gaming event such as a reel 301
20  305 stopping. Alternatively, a gaming sound may be retrieved from data storage and
    be played over speakers 152, 153 with the relative strength of the output signal in each
    channel being dynamically determined as a function of the location of a gaming event
    on the display 106A.
25  It will be appreciated that other sequences of events may be used. For example, the
    reels may stop in turn from right to left or in a different order.
    The method 400 may be adapted for other games. For example, a series of packs of
    cards may be shown on display 106A, the packs ranging in location from the left hand
30  side of the screen to the right hand side of the screen. A card may be revealed
    sequentially from each of the packs and a sound may be played through speakers 152,
    153 to accompany the revealing of the card. As before, the relative dominance of
    speakers 152, 153 may be varied in accordance with the location of the event on
    display 106A.

    As described above, the sounds 501-510 accompany the stopping of reels 301-305
    respectively. The actual timing of the gaming sound relative to the visual display of the

                                                - 11
   corresponding gaming event may be determined by the game designer. Thus, for
   example, the accompanying sound may be played to coincide with or follow
   immediately after the stopping of the reel 301-305. Alternatively, the accompanying
   sound may be played while the reel slows down and stops.

    In the spinning reel game described above, each gaming event occurs at a
   corresponding location. In other games, the gaming event may involve motion between
   the left and right sides of the display 106A. For example, a graphic representation of a
   ball may move across display 106A. The moving ball may be accompanied by a stereo
10 sound played through speakers 152, 153. The relative volume of the gaming sound
   played through each speaker 152, 153 may vary corresponding to the movement of the
   ball. For example, if the ball moves from left to right, the sound may be initially louder
   in the left channel and then progressively become relatively louder in the right channel.
