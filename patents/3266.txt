Abstract
A seeder assembly includes a knife or tine which is held within a channel of a
knife holder by a transverse pin. The knife holder is in turn held onto the frame
of a seeding apparatus by means of transverse bolts. The knife and the knife
holder can be separately replaced as each wears.

Associated provisional applications:
The following statement is a full description of the invention, including
the best method of performing it known to me:

                                         2
                     "CONNECTION OF SEEDER KNIFE"
Field of the Invention
[0001] The present invention relates to agricultural machines, particularly
seeders arranged to create furrows and deposit seeds within.
Background to the Invention
[0002] A seeder is a piece of agricultural machinery arranged to be drawn by
a tractor. Generally, a seeder has a plurality of seeding units spaced across
its width. Each seeding unit has a number of components: a leading 'knife' or
tine arranged to penetrate the ground and create a furrow as the seeder is
pulled forward; a fertiliser tube through which liquid or granular fertiliser can
be deposited in the furrow, a seeding 'boot' through which seeds can be
deposited into the furrow, and a trailing press wheel which acts to close the
furrow.
[0003] The leading knife is subject to significant abrasive wear. As such, it is
necessary for the knife to be periodically replaced.
[0004] It is desirable to construct seeders with knives which are readily
replaceable. It is also important that the knives are securely and rigidly held
in position during use. It has proved difficult to achieve both of these ends.
[0005] The     present invention     proposes     a system    of attachment     of
replaceable knives for seeders.
Summary of the Invention
[0006] According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a
seeder assembly arranged to mount to a seeding apparatus frame, the
assembly including a ground penetrating knife and a knife holder; the knife
having a leading edge defining a direction of travel; the knife holder including
a channel, the knife including a shank arranged to be received in the channel,
wherein the knife holder includes a holding pin receiving bore generally
perpendicular to the direction of travel, the holding pin receiving bore passing

                                        3
through the channel, the knife shank including a holding pin receiving
formation arranged to align, in use, with the holding pin receiving bore; the
knife holder including a locating recess having an upper opening, the locating
recess arranged to locate about a portion of the seeding apparatus frame.
[0007] Preferably, the locating recess includes at least one fixing pin
receiving bore, arranged to align, in use, with a pin receiving aperture on the
seeding apparatus frame. It is preferred that the fixing pin receiving bore is
parallel to the holding pin receiving bore.
[0008] It is preferred that the knife shank is tapered, with thickness
decreasing away from the leading edge.
[0009] The knife shank may be angled relative to the leading edge. In a
preferred embodiment, the knife shank is angled between 10' and 400 relative
to the leading edge, with an angle of around 20' being most preferred.
Brief Description of the Drawings
[0010] It will be convenient to further describe the invention with reference to
preferred embodiments of the present invention. Other embodiments are
possible, and consequently the particularity of the following discussion is not
to be understood as superseding the generality of the preceding description
of the invention. In the drawings:

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments
[0016] Referring to the Figures, there is shown a seeder assembly 100 with
two main components: a ground penetrating knife 10 and a knife holder 50.
[0017] The ground penetrating knife 10 as seen in Figure 1 has a main body
portion 12 which extends away from a shoulder 14. The main body portion 12
is generally trapezoid-prismatic, with: two trapezoid side faces 16; a longest
edge being a leading edge 18; a rear edge 20 parallel to the leading edge 18;
a lower edge 22; and an upper edge corresponding to the shoulder 14. The
leading edge 18 faces towards a forward direction, and the rear edge 20 faces
towards a backwards direction.
[0018] The knife 10 has a shank 30 extending away from the shoulder 14 in
a generally opposite direction to that of the main body portion 12. The shank
30 has a hook 32 at an outer end thereof, facing towards the rear direction.
The shank 30 is generally tapered, with a body thickness reducing from the
shoulder 14 towards the hook 32.
[0019] The shank 30 has a longitudinal direction which is offset by about 20'
relative to the leading edge 18; that is, the shank 30 is tilted towards the rear
direction by about 200 relative to the main body portion 12.
[0020] The hook 32 is formed as a semi-circular recess within the shank 30,
extending from one side to the other in a direction perpendicular to the forward
direction.
[0021] The knife holder 50 is generally prismatic in shape, with side faces 52
corresponding to the side faces 16 of the knife 10, and a front edge 54
corresponding to the leading edge 18 of the knife 10.
[0022] The knife holder 50 has an upper portion 56 and a lower portion 58.

                                        5
[0023] The upper portion 56 is generally rectangular prismatic in shape,
having a top edge 60 which is arranged to be generally horizontal in use. A
locating recess 62 extends within the upper portion, downwardly from the top
edge 60. The locating recess 62 is generally rectangular.
[0024] Two fixing pin receiving bores 64 pass through the locating recess 62,
extending from one side face 52 to the other side face 52. The fixing pin
receiving bores 64 are generally horizontal, and are perpendicular to the side
faces 52.
[0025] The arrangement is such that the knife holder 50 can be fixed to a
seeder frame 80 by positioning the locating recess 62 around a lower end of
the seeder frame 80, and passing fixing pins or bolts 82 through the pin
receiving bores 64 as well as corresponding apertures in the seeder frame 80.
Where bolts 82 are employed, the knife holder 50 can be locked in position
using nuts 84.
[0026] The lower portion 58 of the knife holder 50 has a channel 70 extending
generally diagonally within, oriented at about 450 to the horizontal. The
channel 70 has an outer rim 72 located at a lower forward corner of the knife
holder 50.
[0027] The channel 70 is complementary in shape to the shank 30 of the
knife 10; that is, the channel 70 tapers inwardly from its outer rim 72. The
arrangement is such that the shank 30 can be inserted into the channel 70
such that when the shoulder 14 sits against the outer rim 72, the shank 30
locates snugly within the channel 70. This is shown in Figure 3.
[0028] It will be appreciated that the leading edge 18 of the knife 10 will then
extend downwardly and forward of the front edge 54 of the knife holder 50.
The leading edge 18 of the knife 10 will be oriented at about 250 relative to
the vertical.

                                          6
[0029] The knife holder 50 has a holding pin receiving bore 74 passing
though the knife holder 50 from one side face 52 to the other side face 52.
The holding pin receiving bore 74 passes through the channel 70 near an
inner end thereof. The holding pin receiving bore 74 is generally horizontal,
and is parallel to the fixing pin receiving bores 64.
[0030] The arrangement is that when the shank 30 is inserted into the
channel 70 so the shoulder 14 sits against the outer rim 72, the holding pin
receiving bore 74 aligns with the hook 32 to create a generally cylindrical slot
into which a pin 76 can be inserted. The pin 76 acts to hold to shank 30
securely in position within the channel 70. The pin 76 may have a cotter pin
78 located at an outer end thereof to assist in maintaining the pin 76 in
position.
[0031] It will be appreciated that the knife 10 can be readily replaced by
removing the cotter pin 78 and pin 76; removing a worn knife 10; inserting a
new knife 10; and reinserting the pin 76 and cotter pin 78.
[0032] Should the knife holder 50 itself become worn, it can be readily
replaced by removal of the bolts 82.
[0033] Modifications and variations as would be apparent to a skilled
addressee are deemed to be within the scope of the present invention.
