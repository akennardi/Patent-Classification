Description of Embodiments
[51]     It should be noted in the following description that like or the same reference numerals
in different embodiments denote the same or similar features.
[52]     Figures 1 and 2 show a writing board 10 according to a preferred embodiment. The
writing board 10 comprises an elongated rectangular front main panel 12 made from a material
which allows light to pass through (i.e. transparent or translucent). In the embodiment, the
main panel 12 is transparent and made from glass material.                The main panel 12 can
alternatively be made from transparent plastics material. The main panel 12 comprises a front
surface 14, rear surface 16, side edges 18, a top edge 20 and a bottom edge 22. The main
panel comprises a fully flat front surface 14 which extends between the edges 18 to 22 thereof.
[53]     The writing board 10 further comprises four pockets 30a to 30d arranged in a row along
the rear surface 16 of the main panel 12. The pockets 30a to 30d are formed in a substantially
contiguous arrangement along the length of the main panel 12, spaced from both the top edge
20 and the bottom edge 22. The first and second pockets 30a and 30b are contiguous and
spaced by a middle band section 35 from contiguous third and fourth pockets 30c and 30d.
Each pocket 30 extends between the side edges 18 and terminates at the side edges 18.
[54]     A top section 36 is defined between the top edge 20 and the first pocket 30a and a
bottom section 38 is defined between the bottom edge 22 and the fourth pocket 30d.
[55]     Each pocket 30 comprises elongated slot-shaped openings 32 adjacent a respective
side edge 18. Each pocket 30 is dimensioned to removably receive therein a background
sheet material 85, in the embodiment being an A3 size paper. Each pocket 30 is dimensioned
to receive a sheet material or cardboard material typically between 1 to 3 mm and up to a
maximum thickness of about 15 mm. The background sheet 85 is easily removable and
replaceable with another sheet as needed via the openings 32.

                                                  6
[56]     Figures 4 to 6 show how the pockets 30 are formed. Referring to Figure 4, respective
lengths of double-sided tape 50 is applied to opposite sides of a rod 52. The rod is made from
Perspex material and preferably provides flat opposing sides to which the tape 50 is attached.
[57]     Referring to Figure 5, taped rods 52 are mounted to the rear surface 16 of the main
panel 12. Each rod 52 extends between the side edges 18 and are parallel to each other, and
to the top and bottom edges 20 and 22. The specific distance between each pair of adjacent
rods 52 defines the height of each pocket 30. The double-sided tape 50 forms lines at the
front surface 14 and are thus of a desired line colour. Suitable coloured material can be used
or added to provide the desired line finish, such as vinyl material or other coloured or patterned
material.
[58]     Referring to Figure 6, a backing panel 60 made from plastics (Perspex) material is
mounted to the rods 52. Each backing panel 60 spans the length of two adjacent pockets 30,
and is thus mounted to three of the rods 52. Two backing panels 60 are thus used for the
writing board 10 to form the four pockets 30. Alternatively, a separate backing panel 60 can
be used for each respective pocket 30. Each backing panel 60 extends between the side
edges 18 and terminates at the side edges 18.
[59]    The backing panel 60 comprises an inwardly curved side edge 62 (at one side edge)
for each pocket 30 to allow for easy insertion into and removal of a sheet material 85 from the
pocket 30.
[60]     In use, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, the writing boards 10 are typically mounted to a
structure such as a wall. Alternatively, the writing board 10 can be mounted to a movable
structure such as a movable stand.          It is also possible to mount the writing board 10
horizontally to form a writing table. A customised coloured and/or printed backing material 70
can be mounted to the top section 36 and the bottom section 38. The backing material 70 in
the embodiment is customised printed vinyl material which is adhered to the rear surface 16
of the main panel 12.
[61]     Printed sheet material 85 (Figure 2 and 3) can then be inserted into the pockets 30.
The sheet material 85 can be easily inserted and removed via the openings 32, and can be
replaced as needed.
[62]    As the main panel 12 is transparent, the graphic or writing of the backing material 70
and the printed sheet material 85 are viewable through the main panel 12. Users can then
use marker pens to write or draw onto the front surface 14 of the main panel 12 as required.
The front surface 14 is completely flat and there are no edges or recesses to hinder users
writing thereon.

                                                  7
[63]    In the example shown in Figure 3, each writing board 10 comprises only a single pocket
30. The top section 36 and the bottom section 38 are larger in these examples. The pocket
30 receives a printed sheet material 85 which is used as a reference (for example a graph of
past or expected performance), and where current performance is tracked by writing on the
front surface 14.
[64]    In another embodiment, the writing board 10 can be dimensioned to have one pocket
30 only for a specific paper size, for example A4 or A3 paper.
[65]    The present invention provides a replaceable background writing board, it that it allows
for a customised and easily changeable background material to be added to the writing board
10 which can be used as reference or for any other desired purpose. The entire background
material is visible and there are no portions of the background material that is blocked by any
section of the main panel. The background material can be any generally planar material such
as plain or printed paper, a poster, a cardboard sheet and the like, or it can be a contoured or
shaped item. The background material can simply be for display and thus the invention also
provides a combined display and writing board.
[66]    Whilst preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described, it will be
apparent to skilled persons that modifications can be made to the embodiments described.
For example, the writing board 10 can be made in any size and the pockets 30 can also be
made to accommodate any size sheet material such as A4, A2, Al or A0.               The backing
material 70 and the printed sheet material 85 can also be customised as per customer
requirements. The means for holding the background sheet can also be embodied in other
forms, such as by having lower and/or upper rails or slots into which substantially rigid/stiff
background material can be mounted by inserting and sliding along the rails or slots.
[67]    It is also possible for the writing board 10 to be formed by having co-extensive parallel
panels mounted via spaced rods therebetween. The rods can also be replaced with wider
mounting blocks if desired. It is also possible for the pockets to be formed on the front surface
14, with the backing panel 60 attached to the front and which can be made from glass material.
[68]    A pocket can also be formed adjacent the top edge which can have an opening at the
top edge rather than at the side edge thereof. Each pocket can also have a closed edge and
only one opening to assist in retaining the sheet material therein.
[69]    A pair of pockets can be formed side by side, each pocket in the pair having its
respective opening at a respective side edge thereof. The pockets can both terminate at the
middle where they meet, by having a vertical divider rod mounted thereon.

                                                 8
[70]    The pockets also do not have to be contiguous, and can be spaced from each other.
The pockets can also be disposed in a pattern, such as in a circular arrangement.
[71]    The writing board 10 can be made in any size with any number of pockets, such as an
8-pocket variation shown in Figure 7.
[72]    Figure 7 shows a writing board 10b according to another embodiment, which
comprises pockets 30 arranged in a 4 x 2 array. In this embodiment, the writing board 1Ob
has four pairs of two side by side pockets 30. The writing board 1Ob holds 4 x A3 paper in the
upper pockets 30, and 4 x A3 paper in the bottom pockets 30.        One or more vertical divider
rods 52b are disposed between each pair of pockets 30 to act as a central stop for the
background sheets 85. The upper pockets 30 and lower pockets 30 are separated by a central
band section 35.
[73]    The writing board 1Ob further comprises metallic sections formed in the top section 36,
bottom section 38 and the central band 35 which allows magnets to be mounted to these
sections.    As shown in Figure 8, magnetic buttons 110 can be attached to these
metallic/magnetic sections for mounting notes or other items to the writing board 1Ob.
[74]    Figures 9 to 11 show the steps in forming the magnetic sections of the writing board of
Figure 7. Respective metal plates 80 are cut to size for the top section 36, bottom section 38
and the central band 35, with the plates 80 having apertures 82 formed therein which align
with mount apertures 84 of the writing board 10b. The plates 80 are then attached to their
respective sections, at the rear surface 16 of the main panel 12, via silicon adhesive 88. Once
the adhesive 88 cures, magnetic buttons 120 and other magnetic items can be mounted to
the front surface 14 of the main panel 12 at the metallic/magnetic sections 35, 36 and 38. The
metal plates can also be replaced with magnetic strips.
[75]    As the pockets 30 and the magnetic sections are formed along the rear surface 16of
the main panel 12, the front surface 14 is free from any obstruction. Although less preferred,
the backing panels 60 can be mounted to the front surface 14, with the backing panels forming
a writing surface. The plates 80 can also be attached to the front surface 14. The plate 80
can also be replaced with a magnetic strip for attaching metal pins or plates to the writing
board.
[76]    Figures 12 and 13 show a writing board 10c according to another embodiment. The
writing board 1Oc also comprises a rectangular front main panel 12 which is also made from
glass or transparent plastics material. The writing board 1Oc also defines at least one pocket
30 dimensioned to receive a sheet material.

                                                9
[77]    Each pocket 30 in this embodiment is formed using rectangular blocks 52b which
replace the rods 52 in the other embodiments above. Each block 52b is made from Perspex
material and is 1.5 to 3 mm thick, preferably 2 mm. Each block 52 provides flat opposed sides
53 for attachment to the main panel 12 and the backing panel 60.
[78]    Each block 52 is disposed adjacent the top edge 20 or bottom edge 22 of the main
panel 12. Each block 52b comprises edge faces 55 which are aligned with the respective top
edge 20 or bottom edge 22, and the side edges 18 of the main panel 12. The backing panel
60 is mounted to the blocks 52b, with the backing panel edges aligned with the edges of the
main panel 12. Fasteners for mounting the writing board 1Oc to a structure will extend through
mount apertures 59 which extends through the main panel 12, block 52b and the backing
panel 60.
The block 52b which extends to the side edges 18 and top edge 20 or bottom edge 22 provides
easy to clean edges which does not allow dust to collect in an inaccessible location. The
backing panel 60 is co-extensive as the main panel 12 (edge to edge and top to bottom). The
writing board 10c provides edges which are aligned and where no recesses are formed (the
panels and mounting block edges are flush with each other at least at the top and lower
edges), which is easy to clean and is thus suitable for use in clean spaces such as hospitals.
