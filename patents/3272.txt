                                                                   Field
                 The present invention generally relates to anti-5T4 antibody-drug conjugates
for the treatment of cancer.
                 This is a divisional of Australian patent application No. <removed-apn>, which in
turn is a divisional of Australian patent application No. 2012235817, the entire
 contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
                                                                Background
                 Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) combine the binding specificity of
 monoclonal antibodies with the potency of chemotherapeutic agents. The technology
 associated with the development of monoclonal antibodies to tumor associated target
 molecules, the use of more effective cytotoxic agents, and the design of chemical
 linkers to covalently bind these components, has progressed rapidly in recent years
 (Ducry L., et al. Bioconjugate Chemistry, 21:5-13, 2010).
                 Promising ADCs such as SGN-75 (US2009/148942) and trastuzumab-DM1
 (US2009/0226465) are currently in clinical trials. However, as other tumor associated
 antigens are considered for targets, numerous challenges remain. Each monoclonal
 antibody must be characterized separately, an appropriate linker designed, and a
 suitable cytotoxic agent identified that retains its potency upon delivery to tumor cells.
 One must consider the antigen density on the cancer target and whether normal
tissues express the target antigen. Other considerations include whether the entire
ADC is internalized upon binding the target; whether a cytostatic or cytotoxic drug is
 preferable when considering possible normal tissue exposure and/or the type and
 stage of the cancer being treated; and, whether the linker connecting the antibody to
the drug payload is a cleavable or a non-cleavable linkage. Furthermore, the antibody
to drug moiety conjugation ratio must be sufficient without compromising the binding
 activity of the antibody and/or the potency of the drug. It is evident that ADCs are
 complex biologics and the challenges to develop an effective ADC remain significant.
                                                                     1

      WO 2012/131527                                                       PCT/IB2012/051304
          The human 5T4 tumor associated antigen is the target antigen of the present
   invention. It has recently been shown that the 5T4 antigen is expressed in high levels on
   certain highly tumorigenic cells, also called tumor-initiating cells (W02010/111659).
   Tumor-initiating cells show resistance to standard therapies and are believed to be
 5 responsible for tumor recurrence and metastasis and therefore present yet another
   obstacle for ADC development.
          The novel anti-5T4 ADCs of the present invention overcome the challenges
   associated with ADC technology and provide highly specific and potent ADCs that bind to
   tumor cells expressing the 5T4 antigen and deliver sufficient cytotoxic drug to the cells,
 0 thus providing an innovative and effective treatment for cancer.

 5                                       Detailed Description
           The present invention provides anti-5T4 antibody-drug conjugates for the treatment
   of cancer. In order that the present invention is more readily understood, certain terms are
   first defined.
           All amino acid abbreviations used in this disclosure are those accepted by the
20 United States Patent and Trademark Office as set forth in 37 C.F.R. § 1.822 (B)(1).
           5T4 refers to the 5T4 oncofetal antigen, a 72 kDa highly glycosylated
   transmenbrance glycoprotein comprising a 42 kDa non-glycosylated core
   (see US 5,869,053). Human 5T4 is expressed in numerous cancer types, including
   carcinomas of the bladder, breast, cervix, colon, endometrium, kidney, lung, esophagus,
25 ovary, prostate, pancreas, liver, skin, stomach, and testes. Highly tumorigenic cells, also
   called cancer stem cells or tumor-initiating cells have been shown to have high levels of
   5T4 expression (W02010/111659). Anti-5T4 antibodies of the invention include antibodies
   that specifically bind the human 5T4 antigen (see US 2007/0231333).

       WO 2012/131527                                                     PCT/IB2012/051304
          An "antibody" is an immunoglobulin molecule capable of specific binding to a target,
   such as a carbohydrate, polynucleotide, lipid, polypeptide, etc., through at least one
   antigen recognition site, located in the variable region of the immunoglobulin molecule. As
   used herein, the term "antibody" encompasses not only intact polyclonal or monoclonal
 5 antibodies, but also any antigen binding fragment (i.e., "antigen-binding portion") or single
   chain thereof, fusion proteins comprising an antibody, and any other modified configuration
   of the immunoglobulin molecule that comprises an antigen recognition site including, for
   example without limitation, Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2, an Fd fragment consisting of the VH and
   CH1 domains, an Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an
 0 antibody, an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR), scFv, single domain
   antibodies (e.g., shark and camelid antibodies), maxibodies, minibodies, intrabodies,
   diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, v-NAR and bis-scFv.
          An antibody includes an antibody of any class, such as IgG, IgA, or IgM (or sub
   class thereof), and the antibody need not be of any particular class. Depending on the
 5 antibody amino acid sequence of the constant region of its heavy chains, immunoglobulins
   can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins:
   IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses
   (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant regions
   that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha, delta, epsilon,
20 gamma, and mu, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional
   configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.
          A "variable region" of an antibody refers to the variable region of the antibody light
   chain or the variable region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combination. As
   known in the art, the variable regions of the heavy and light chain each consist of four
25 framework regions (FRs) connected by three complementarity determining regions (CDRs)
   also known as hypervariable regions, contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site
   of antibodies. If variants of a subject variable region are desired, particularly with
   substitution in amino acid residues outside of a CDR region (i.e., in the framework region),
   appropriate amino acid substitution, preferably, conservative amino acid substitution, can
                                                   6

       WO 2012/131527                                                     PCT/IB2012/051304
   be identified by comparing the subject variable region to the variable regions of other
   antibodies which contain CDR1 and CDR2 sequences in the same canonincal class as the
   subject variable region (Chothia and Lesk, J Mol Biol 196(4): 901-917, 1987). When
   choosing FR to flank subject CDRs, e.g., when humanizing or optimizing an antibody, FRs
 5 from antibodies which contain CDR1 and CDR2 sequences in the same canonical class
   are preferred.
           A "CDR" of a variable domain are amino acid residues within the variable region
   that are identified in accordance with the definitions of the Kabat, Chothia, the cumulation
   of both Kabat and Chothia, AbM, contact, and/or conformational definitions or any method
 0 of CDR determination well known in the art. Antibody CDRs may be identified as the
   hypervariable regions originally defined by Kabat et al. See, e.g., Kabat et al., 1992,
   Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th ed., Public Health Service, NIH,
   Washington, D.C. The positions of the CDRs may also be identified as the structural loop
   structures originally described by Chothia and others. See, e.g., Chothia et al., 1989,
 5 Nature 342:877-883. Other approaches to CDR identification include the "AbM definition,"
   which is a compromise between Kabat and Chothia and is derived using Oxford
   Molecular's AbM antibody modeling software (now Accelrys@), or the "contact definition" of
   CDRs based on observed antigen contacts, set forth in MacCallum et al., 1996, J. Mol.
   Biol., 262:732-745. In another approach, referred to herein as the "conformational
20 definition" of CDRs, the positions of the CDRs may be identified as the residues that make
   enthalpic contributions to antigen binding. See, e.g., Makabe et al., 2008, Journal of
   Biological Chemistry, 283:1156-1166. Still other CDR boundary definitions may not strictly
   follow one of the above approaches, but will nonetheless overlap with at least a portion of
   the Kabat CDRs, although they may be shortened or lengthened in light of prediction or
25 experimental findings that particular residues or groups of residues or even entire CDRs
   do not significantly impact antigen binding. As used herein, a CDR may refer to CDRs
   defined by any approach known in the art, including combinations of approaches. The
   methods used herein may utilize CDRs defined according to any of these approaches. For
   any given embodiment containing more than one CDR, the CDRs may be defined in
                                                  7

       WO 2012/131527                                                     PCT/IB2012/051304
   accordance with any of Kabat, Chothia, extended, AbM, contact, and/or conformational
   definitions.
           The term "monoclonal antibody" (Mab) refers to an antibody that is derived from a
   single copy or clone, including e.g., any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not
 5 the method by which it is produced. Preferably, a monoclonal antibody of the invention
   exists in a homogeneous or substantially homogeneous population.
           "Humanized" antibody refers to forms of non-human (e.g. murine) antibodies that
   are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains, or fragments thereof (such as Fv,
   Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2 or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) that contain
 0 minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Preferably, humanized
   antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a
   complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a
   CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, or rabbit having the
   desired specificity, affinity, and capacity.
 5         The term "chimeric antibody" is intended to refer to antibodies in which the variable
   region sequences are derived from one species and the constant region sequences are
   derived from another species, such as an antibody in which the variable region sequences
   are derived from a mouse antibody and the constant region sequences are derived from a
   human antibody.
20         Antibodies of the invention can be produced using techniques well known in the art,
   e.g., recombinant technologies, phage display technologies, synthetic technologies or
   combinations of such technologies or other technologies readily known in the art (see, for
   example, Jayasena, S.D., Clin. Chem., 45: 1628-50 (1999) and Fellouse, F.A., et al, J.
   Mol, Biol., 373(4):924-40 (2007)),

           The phrases "an antibody recognizing an antigen" and "an antibody specific for an
   antigen" are used interchangeably herein with the term "an antibody which binds
   specifically to an antigen."
           Anti-5T4 Antibody-Drug conjugate refers to an anti-5T4 antibody or antigen binding
 5 portion thereof, as described herein linked to a cytotoxic drug moiety (D) via a linker unit
   molecule (LU).
           Linker Unit (LU): LU describes the direct or indirect linkage of the antibody to the
   drug. Attachment of a linker to a mAb can be accomplished in a variety of ways, such as
   through surface lysines, reductive-coupling to oxidized carbohydrates, and through
 0 cysteine residues liberated by reducing interchain disulfide linkages. A variety of ADC
   linkage systems are known in the art, including hydrazone-, disulfide- and peptide-based
   linkages.
           Drug (D): A drug is any substance having biological or detectable activity, for
   example, therapeutic agents, detectable labels, binding agents, etc., and prodrugs, which
 5 are metabolized to an active agent in vivo. The terms drug and payload are used
   interchangeably. In some embodiments, the Drug is an auristatin, such as auristatin E
   (also known in the art as a derivative of dolastatin-1 0) or a derivative thereof. The
   auristatin can be, for example, an ester formed between auristatin E and a keto acid. For
   example, auristatin E can be reacted with paraacetyl benzoic acid or benzoylvaleric acid to
20 produce AEB and AEVB, respectively. Other typical auristatins include AFP, MMAF, and
   MMAE. The synthesis and structure of exemplary auristatins are described in U.S. Patent
   Nos. 6,884,869, 7,098,308, 7,256,257, 7,423,116, 7,498,298 and 7,745,394, each of which
   is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and for all purposes.
           Auristatins have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics and nuclear
25 and cellular division and have anticancer activity. Auristatins of the present invention bind
   tubulin and can exert a cytotoxic or cytostatic effect on a 5T4 expressing cell or cell line.
   There are a number of different assays, known in the art, that can be used for determining
   whether an auristatin or resultant antibody-drug conjugate exerts a cytostatic or cytotoxic
   effect on a desired cell or cell line. Methods for determining whether a compound binds

20 present invention are selected from the group consisting of mc-MMAF and mc-Val-Cit
   PABA-MMAE.
            The term "epitope" refers to that portion of a molecule capable of being recognized
   by and bound by an antibody at one or more of the antibody's antigen-binding regions.
   Epitopes often consist of a chemically active surface grouping of molecules such as amino
25 acids or sugar side chains and have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics as
   well as specific charge characteristics. The term "antigenic epitope" as used herein, is
   defined as a portion of a polypeptide to which an antibody can specifically bind as
   determined by any method well known in the art, for example, by conventional
   immunoassays. A "nonlinear epitope" or "conformational epitope" comprises
                                                    12

       WO 2012/131527                                                         PCT/IB2012/051304
   noncontiguous polypeptides (or amino acids) within the antigenic protein to which an
   antibody specific to the epitope binds.
           The term "binding affinity (KD)" as used herein, is intended to refer to the
   dissociation rate of a particular antigen-antibody interaction. The KD is the ratio of the rate
 5 of dissociation, also called the "off-rate (kof)", to the association rate, or "on- rate (kon)"
   Thus, K0 equals kof / ko, and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). It follows that the
   smaller the KD, the stronger the affinity of binding. Therefore, a KD of 1 pM indicates weak
   binding affinity compared to a KD of 1 nM. Ko values for antibodies can be determined
   using methods well established in the art. One method for determining the Ko of an
 0 antibody is by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), typically using a biosensor system
   such as a Biacore@ system.
           The term "specifically binds" as used herein in reference to the binding between an
   antibody and a 5T4 antigen and the antibody binds the 5T4 antigen with a Ko less than
   about 30 nM as determined by SPR at 25C.
 5         Pharmaceutically acceptable salt as used herein refers to pharmaceutically
   acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a molecule or macromolecule.
           The term "potency" is a measurement of biological activity and may be designated
   as IC50 , or effective concentration of antibody needed to inhibit 50% of growth of a 5T4
   positive cell line as described in Example 3. Alternatively, potency may refer to anti-tumor
20 activity as determined in an in vivo tumor xenograph model as shown in Example 4.
           The terms "polynucleotide" or "nucleic acid molecule", as used herein, are intended
   to include DNA molecules and RNA molecules. A nucleic acid molecule may be single
   stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA.
           The polynucleotides that encode the antibodies of the present invention may include
25 the following: only the coding sequence for the variant, the coding sequence for the
   variant and additional coding sequences such as a functional polypeptide, or a signal or
   secretory sequence or a pro-protein sequence; the coding sequence for the antibody and
   non-coding sequence, such as introns or non-coding sequence 5' and/or 3' of the coding
   sequence for the antibody. The term 'polynucleotide encoding an antibody" encompasses
                                                    13

       WO 2012/131527                                                       PCT/IB2012/051304
   a polynucleotide which includes additional coding sequence for the variant but also a
   polynucleotide which includes additional coding and/or non-coding sequence. It is known
   in the art that a polynucleotide sequence that is optimized for a specific host
   cell/expression system can readily be obtained from the amino acid sequence of the
 5 desired protein (see GENEART* AG, Regensburg, Germany).
           The polynucleotides encoding the antibodies of the present invention will typically
   include an expression control polynucleotide sequence operably linked to the antibody
   coding sequences, including naturally-associated or heterologous promoter regions known
   in the art. Preferably, the expression control sequences will be eukaryotic promoter
 0 systems in vectors capable of transforming or transfecting eukaryotic host cells, but control
   sequences for prokaryotic hosts may also be used. Once the vector has been incorporated
   into the appropriate host cell line, the host cell is propagated under conditions suitable for
   expressing the nucleotide sequences, and, as desired, for the collection and purification of
   the antibodies. Preferred eukaryotic cell lines include the CHO cell lines, various COS cell
 5 lines, HeLa cells, myeloma cell lines, transformed B-cells, or human embryonic kidney cell
   lines. The most preferred host cell is a CHO cell line.
           The present invention encompasses antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof
   that bind to a specific epitope on the 5T4 antigen. The epitope identified is a nonlinear or
   conformational epitope comprising a first contact with the human 5T4 antigen (SEQ ID NO:
20 11) between amino acid residues 173 and 252 and comprising a second contact between
   amino acid residues 276 and 355 (see Example 7). Thus, the CDRs and heavy and light
   chain variable regions described herein are used to make full-length antibodies as well as
   functional fragments and analogs that maintain the binding affinity of the protein employing
   the CDRs specific for the above mentioned epitope of the 5T4 antigen.
25         The binding affinity of antibodies of the present invention is determined using SPR
   (Example 6). In these experiments the 5T4 antigens are immobilized at low densities onto
   a BlAcore* chip and antibodies are flowed past. Build up of mass at the surface of the
   chip is measured. This analytical method allows the determination in real time of both on
   and off rates to obtain affinity (Ko) for binding. The humanized antibodies of the present

   about 1.0 and about 3 nM.
           Conjugation of Drugs to an Antibody
 5         The drug has, or is modified to include, a group reactive with a conjugation point on
   the antibody. For example, a drug can be attached by alkylation (e.g., at the epsilon-amino
   group lysines or the N-terminus of antibodies), reductive amination of oxidized
   carbohydrate, transesterification between hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, amidation at
   amino groups or carboxyl groups, and conjugation to thiols. In some embodiments, the
 0 number of drug moieties, p, conjugated per antibody molecule ranges from an average of
   1 to 8; 1 to 7, 1 to 6, 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, or 1 to 2. In some embodiments, p ranges from
   an average of 2 to 8, 2 to 7, 2 to 6, 2 to 5, 2 to 4 or 2 to 3. In other embodiments, p is an
   average of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8. In some embodiments, p ranges from an average of
   about 1 to about 8; about 1 to about 7, about 1 to about 6, about 1 to about 5, about 1 to
 5 about 4, about 1 to about 3, or about 1 to about 2. In some embodiments, p ranges from
   about 2 to about 8, about 2 to about 7, about 2 to about 6, about 2 to about 5, about 2 to
   about 4 or about 2 to about 3. For examples of chemistries that can be used for
   conjugation, see, e.g., Current Protocols in Protein Science (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.),
   Chapter 15 (Chemical Modifications of Proteins) (the disclosure of which is incorporated by
20 reference herein in its entirety.)
           For example, when chemical activation of the protein results in formation of free
   thiol groups, the protein may be conjugated with a sulfhydryl reactive agent. In one
   aspect, the agent is one which is substantially specific for free thiol groups. Such agents
   include, for example, malemide, haloacetamides (e.g., iodo, bromo or chloro), haloesters
25 (e.g., iodo, bromo or chloro), halomethyl ketones (e.g., iodo, bromo or chloro), benzylic
   halides (e.g., iodide, bromide or chloride), vinyl sulfone and pyridylthio.
           Linkers
           The drug can be linked to an antibody by a linker. Suitable linkers include, for
   example, cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. A cleavable linker is typically susceptible to
                                                      15

       WO 2012/131527                                                        PCT/IB2012/051304
   cleavage under intracellular conditions. Suitable cleavable linkers include, for example, a
   peptide linker cleavable by an intracellular protease, such as lysosomal protease or an
   endosomal protease. In exemplary embodiments, the linker can be a dipeptide linker,
   such as a valine-citrulline (val-cit), a phenylalanine-lysine (phe-lys) linker, or
 5 maleimidocapronic -valine-citruline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (mc-Val-Cit-PABA) linker.
   Another linker is Sulfosuccinimidyl-4-[N-maleimidomethyl]cyclohexane-1 -carboxylate
   (smcc). Sulfo-smcc conjugation occurs via a maleimide group which reacts with
   sulfhydryls (thiols, -SH), while its Sulfo-NHS ester is reactive toward primary amines (as
   found in Lysine and the protein or peptide N-terminus). Yet another linker is
 0 maleimidocaproyl (mc). Other suitable linkers include linkers hydrolyzable at a specific pH
   or a pH range, such as a hydrazone linker. Additional suitable cleavable linkers include
   disulfide linkers. The linker may be covalently bound to the antibody to such an extent that
   the antibody must be degraded intracellularly in order for the drug to be released e.g. the
   mc linker and the like.
 5         A linker can include a group for linkage to the antibody. For example, linker can
   include an amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl or sulfhydryl reactive groups (e.g., malemide,
   haloacetamides (e.g., iodo, bromo or chloro), haloesters (e.g., iodo, bromo or chloro),
   halomethyl ketones (e.g., iodo, bromo or chloro), benzylic halides (e.g., iodide, bromide or
   chloride), vinyl sulfone and pyridylthio). See generally Wong, Chemistry of Protein
20 Conjugation and Cross-linking; CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, 1991.
           Immunotherapy
           For immunotherapy, an antibody can be conjugated to a suitable drug, such as a
   cytotoxic or cytostatic agent, an immunosuppressive agent, a radioisotope, a toxin, or the
   like. The conjugate can be used for inhibiting the multiplication of a tumor cell or cancer
25 cell, causing apoptosis in a tumor or cancer cell, or for treating cancer in a patient. The
   conjugate can be used accordingly in a variety of settings for the treatment of animal
   cancers. The conjugate can be used to deliver a drug to a tumor cell or cancer cell.
   Without being bound by theory, in some embodiments, the conjugate binds to or
   associates with a cancer-cell or a tumor-associated antigen, and the conjugate and/or drug
                                                   16

   can be taken up inside a tumor cell or cancer cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis.
   The antigen can be attached to a tumor cell or cancer cell or can be an extracellular matrix
   protein associated with the tumor cell or cancer cell. Once inside the cell, one or more
   specific peptide sequences within the conjugate (e.g., in a linker) are hydrolytically cleaved
 5 by one or more tumor-cell or cancer-cell-associated proteases, resulting in release of the
   drug. The released drug is then free to migrate within the cell and induce cytotoxic or
   cytostatic or other activities. In some embodiments, the drug is cleaved from the antibody
   outside the tumor cell or cancer cell, and the drug subsequently penetrates the cell, or acts
   at the cell surface.
 0         Therapy for Cancer
           As discussed above, cancers, including, but not limited to, a tumor, metastasis, or
   other disease or disorder characterized by uncontrolled cell growth, can be treated or
   prevented by administration of a protein-drug conjugate.
           In other embodiments, methods for treating or preventing cancer are provided,
 5 including administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a conjugate and
   a chemotherapeutic agent. In some embodiments, the chemotherapeutic agent is that with
   which treatment of the cancer has not been found to be refractory. In some embodiments,
   the chemotherapeutic agent is that with which the treatment of cancer has been found to
   be refractory. The conjugate can be administered to a patient that has also undergone a
20 treatment, such as surgery for treatment for the cancer. In another embodiment, the
   additional method of treatment is radiation therapy.
           Multi-Drug Therapy for Cancer
           Methods for treating cancer include administering to a patient in need thereof an
   effective amount of an antibody-drug conjugate and another therapeutic agent that is an
25 anti-cancer agent. Suitable anticancer agents include, but are not limited to, methotrexate,
   taxol, L-asparaginase, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, hydroxyurea, cytarabine,
   cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, nitrosoureas, cisplatin, carboplatin, mitomycin,

           The ADCs of the present invention can be in the form of a pharmaceutical
   composition for administration that are formulated to be appropriate for the selected mode
 5 of administration, and pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or excipients, such as buffers,
   surfactants, preservatives, solubilizing agents, isotonicity agents, stabilizing agents,
   carriers, and the like. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co.,
   Easton Pa.,    1 8 th ed., 1995, incorporated herein by reference, provides a compendium of
   formulation techniques as are generally known to practitioners.
 0         These pharmaceutical compositions may be administered by any means known in
   the art that achieve the generally intended purpose to treat cancer. The preferred route of
   administration is parenteral, defined herein as referring to modes of administration that
   include but not limited to intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, and
   intraarticular injection and infusion. The dosage administered will be dependent upon the
 5 age, health, and weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of
   treatment, and the nature of the effect desired.
           Compositions within the scope of the invention include all compositions wherein an
   ADC is present in an amount that is effective to achieve the desired medical effect for
   treating cancer. While individual needs may vary from one patient to another, the
20 determination of the optimal ranges of effective amounts of all of the components is within
   the ability of the clinician of ordinary skill.

   1 mM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) for 2 h at 37 *C. The desired linker
   payload is then added to the reaction mixture at a linker-payload/mAb-thiol molar ratio of
   5.5 (maleimidocapronic-monomethylauristatin F [mc-MMAF]) or 8 (maleimidocapronic
   valine-citruline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl- monomethylauristatin E [mc-Val-Cit-PABA
 5 MMAE]) and reacted for an additional 1 h at 25 0C in the presence of 15% v/v of
   dimethylacetamide (DMA). After the 1 h incubation period, N-ethylmaleimide (4.5 fold
   excess for mc-MMAF and 2 fold excess for mc-Val-Cit-PABA-M MAE) is added to cap the
   unreacted thiols and is allowed to react for 15 minutes followed by addition of 6 fold excess
   L-Cys to quench any unreacted linker-payload. The reaction mixture is dialyzed overnight
 0 at 4 *C in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and purified via SEC (AKTA explorer,
   Superdex 200 10/30 GL column). The ADC is further characterized via size exclusion
   chromatography (SEC ) for purity, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), and
   liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS) to
   calculate loading, and the concentration is determined via UV spectrophotometer.

            Cells expressing the 5T4 antigen, and the negative control Raji cells, are plated at a
   density of 500,000 cells/well on non-tissue culture treated 96 well plates and kept on ice.
20 Dilutions of the Al and Al -IgG4 antibodies or Al -mcMMAF ADC are made in 3% bovine
   serum albumin BSA in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) and added to the
   plate at a final concentration of 1opg/mL. The plates are then incubated on ice for 1 hour
   followed by 2 washes. The secondary antibody, PE (phycoerythrin) conjugated Goat Anti
   Human IgG Fc is added to the wells. After 30 minutes of incubation at 4 C, the mean
25 fluorescence intensity is then measured using a flow cytometer.
           The data in Table 4 indicates that the Al antibody binds a diverse panel of 5T4
   positive cell lines. The data in Table 5 indicates that similar binding on several different
   cell lines is observed with the Al and Al-IgG4 antibodies as well as the Al-mcMMAF
   ADC.

            Unexpectedly, the data in Tables 8-11 show that ADCs with the same antibody and
   drug payload but with different linkers had a dissimilar efficacy profile i.e. Al-mcMMAD vs
10 A1-vcMMAD in all four xenograft models. In addition, the data show that ADCs with the
   same antibody and linker but with different drug payloads also had a different efficacy
   profile i.e. Al-mcMMAF vs Al-mcMMAD, in all four xenograft models. Thus, the drug
   MMAD is effective in all four xenograft models when linked to the Al antibody by the vc
   linker but has no activity in any of the xenograft models tested when linked by the mc
15 linker. In contrast, the drug MMAF is highly effective in all 4 xenograft models when linked

   to the Al antibody with the mc linker while the chemically related drug MMAD has no
   activity in all 4 xenograft models when linked to the same antibody by the same linker.
           Yet another unexpected observation is seen with the ADC Al-smccDM1 (Tables 8
   10). This ADC was very effective against the MDAMB361 DYT2 xenograft but had
 5 essentially no effect against the MDAMB435/5T4 and the H1975 xenografts even though
   all the xenografts have a high expression of the 5T4 target antigen. This data illustrates
   that the effectiveness of the linker-payload could not be predicted even when the same
   high affinity antibody is utilized or even when the same ADC is used.

20 4 hours for ADCC activity. The plate is harvested by adding equal volume of CytoTox-One
   reagent (Promega). Stop solution (Promega; 50 ul) is added to each well and lactate

15         Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis is performed utilizing the BlAcore* to
   determine the affinity constants for Al -IgG1 and Al -IgG4 binding to either human or
   cynomolgus 5T4 at pH 6.0 and pH 7.4. BlAcore* technology utilizes changes in the
   refractive index at the surface layer upon binding of the huAl antibody variants to the
   human 5T4 protein immobilized on the surface layer. Binding is detected by SPR of laser
20 light refracting from the surface. Analysis of the signal kinetics on-rate and off-rate allows
   the discrimination between non-specific and specific interactions. The 5T4 proteins used
   for this analysis consisted of the human or cynomolgus 5T4 ectodomain fused to the
   human IgG1-Fc domain and low densities (45.1 and 45.4 RU for human and cynomolgus
   respectively) are immobilized onto a CM5 chip to accurately measure affinity constants.

          The measurement of specific binding to the 5T4 ectodomain is attained by
   subtracting binding to a reference surface that had only human IgG1-Fc protein
   immobilized onto the CM5 chip at the same density to that on the 5T4-Fc surfaces. Next,
   various concentrations of Al, Al -IgG4, or A3 antibodies in either HBS-EP pH 7.4 or MES
 5 EP pH 6.0 buffer are injected over the surface. The surface is regenerated two times with
   Glycine pH 1.7 + 0.05% Surfactant P20 (GE Healthcare, BR-1000-54) between injection
   cycles.
           Results show that the Al has a slightly higher affinity for human 5T4 using the low
   density 5T4 surface at both pH 6.0 and pH 7.4 relative to Al -IgG4 (1.5-fold and 1.2-fold
 0 respectively, Table 13). Additionally, Al exhibited slightly better binding to cynomolgus
   5T4 at both pH 6.0 and pH 7.4 compared to Al -IgG4 (1.7-fold and 1.2-fold respectively)
   and both Al and Al -IgG4 bound human 5T4, 3 - 4 fold better than cynomolgus 5T4 (Table
   12).

           To identify the epitopes to which each of the Al and A3 antibodies bind, an enzyme
   linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is performed using (1) 5T4 ectodomain Fc construct
   and (2) human/mouse 5T4 chimera constructs transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. The
   ectodomain includes the amino-terminal region, two leucine-rich repeats, and the
 0 intervening hydrophilic region. Mouse and rat 5T4 ectodomains contain a 6 amino acid
   direct repeat within their hydrophilic region.
           Fusion proteins containing a 5T4 ectodomain and a Fc constant region from human
   IgG1 are prepared using human 5T4 (amino acids 1-355), mouse 5T4 (amino acids 1
   361), rat 5T4 (amino acids 1-361), cynomologus monkey 5T4 (amino acids 1-355),
15 chimpanzee 5T4 (amino acids 1-355), and black-tailed marmoset (amino acids 1-355).
   The binding results with human/mouse 5T4 chimera constructs are summarized in Table
   14, which indicates specific binding, partial binding, or lack of binding, by the Al and A3
   antibodies.
           Table 15 refers to binding ability of the antibodies to the various human/mouse
20 chimeras and the nomenclature is designated by mouse 5T4 content. When no binding is

   observed, this indicates where the antibody binds human 5T4 since these antibodies do
   not bind mouse 5T4. For example, the A3 antibody has the most N-terminal binding
   epitope (between 83 - 163) and this is shown by lack of binding to the 5T4 chimera that
   has residues 83 - 163 replaced by mouse 5T4, hence A3 can no longer bind. Based upon
 5 these results, it is determined that humanized Al antibody has a first contact with human
   5T4 between amino acid residues 173 and 252 and a second contact with human 5T4
   between amino acid residues 276 and 355. The A3 antibody binds the first leucine-rich
   repeat region of human 5T4 between amino acid residues 83 through 163. The number of
   amino acid residues corresponds to the human 5T4 antigen amino acid sequence of SEQ
 0 ID NO: 11.

 5 approximately 200 mm2 in size. The anti-tumor activity of Al -IgG4-CM at a dose of 3
   mg/kg is similar to the anti-tumor activity of Al -mcMMAF administered at dose of 10 mg/kg
   (Table 16). Based upon these results, the anti-tumor activity of Al -IgG4-CM is
   approximately 3.3 fold more potent than Al -mcMMAF.

           It could be expected that the 3.3 fold enhanced potency of Al -IgG4-CM over that of
   Al -mcMMAF would translate into a 3.3 fold enhanced safety margin of Al -mcMMAF over
15 that of A1-IgG4-CM in an animal toxicity study. However, when the safety profile of Al
   IgG4-CM in cynomolgus macques is reviewed, it is determined that Al -IgG4-CM is at least
   100 fold more toxic than A1-mcMMAF in the cynomolgus macque. When A1-IgG4-CM is

   administered at 0.032, 0.095 and 0.32 mg Ab/kg/cycle (2, 6, 20 pg calicheamicin/kg/cycle)
   to male (n=3) and female (n=3) cynomolgus macques, toxicity is observed at each dose
   level. After 2 cycles (2 doses), 4 out of 6 animals in the 0.095 treatment group are either
   euthanized or found dead. On the other hand, no deaths are observed at dosages up to
 5 10 mg/kg with A1-mcMMAF (247 pg mcMMAF/kg/cycle), after 2 cycles (2 doses), over the
   same 4 week time period. In summary, the 10 mg/kg dosage group of A1-mcMMAF is
   safe while the 0.096 mg/kg dosage group of Al -IgG4-CM is deemed toxic when both are
   administered twice to cynomolgus macques in a 4 week observation period.
           Unexpectedly, these results demonstrate a 105 fold (10/0.095=105) safety margin
 0 of Al -mcMMAF over that of Al -IgG4-CM, rather than the expected 3.3 fold safety margin
   based on the relative anti-tumor potency of each ADC. This data reveals the unpredictable
   nature of antibody-drug conjugates that utilize antibodies to the same antigen target but
   are conjugated to a different drug payload.

              A1-mcMMAF Mouse PKIPD Modeling and Clinical Dose Predictions
           PK/PD modeling has been used to quantify the tumor response of Al -mcMMAF in
   mouse xenograft studies, in order to determine efficacious concentration across cell lines.
   The transit compartment tumor kill PK/PD model used was previously described by
20 Simeoni et al. (Simeoni et al, Cancer Res, 64:1094, (2004)). The model has been
   modified to account for linear, exponential and logistic growth of tumor, and saturative
   killing by the drug. PK/PD model parameters include:
           kg ex         exponential growth
           kg           logistic growth

          The PK/PD modeling results are used to calculate the Tumor Static Concentration
   (TSC, Equation 1). This is the drug concentration where tumor growth is equal to tumor
   death rates and tumor volume remains unchanged. TSC can be defined as the minimal
   concentration required for efficacy. TSC is used to give guidance on clinical dose
 5 selection, with concentrations of >TSC required for efficacy in the clinic.
          For Al -mcMMAF, mouse PK was determined in a separate study (3mg/kg IV,
   female athymic nu/nu mice). Mouse xenograft studies were completed using 3 different
   5T4 cell lines with Al -mcMMAF administered at dose levels between 1 and 30 mg/kg
   every 4 days: cell line MDAMB435/5T4 (dosed at 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg), cell line H1975
 0 (dosed at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) and cell line 37622A (dosed at 1 and 10 mg/kg).       PK/PD
   modeling was performed as described and TSCs are reported in Table 17.
          Mouse PK/PD parameters for each xenograft cell line were combined with predicted
   human PK of Al -mcMMAF to simulate doses required for efficacy in the clinic. Using this
   methodology, A1-mcMMAF has a predicted minimally efficacious clinical dose of about
 5 0.22 to about 2.3 mg/kg Q3 weeks [every three weeks] (Table 17).
          In an embodiment of the present invention, dose ranges can be in the range from
   about 0.18 mg/kg to about 2.7 mg/kg, from about 0.22 mg/kg to about 2.6 mg/kg, from
   about 0.27 mg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg, from about 0.32 mg/kg to about 2.3 mg/kg, from
   about 0.37 mg/kg to about 2.15 mg/kg, from about 0.42 mg/kg to about 2.10 mg/kg, from
20 about 0.47 mg/kg to about 2.05 mg/kg, from about 0.52 mg/kg to about 2.00 mg/kg, from
   about 0.57 mg/kg to about 1.95 mg/kg, from about 0.62 mg/kg to about 1.90 mg/kg, from
   about 0.67 mg/kg to about 1.85 mg/kg, from about 0.72 mg/kg to about 1.80 mg/kg, from
   about 0.82 mg/kg to about 1.70 mg/kg, from about 0.92 mg/kg to about 1.60 mg/kg, from
   about 1.02 mg/kg to about 1.50 mg/kg, from about 1.12 mg/kg to about 1.40 mg/kg, or
25 from about 1.20 mg/kg to about 1.30 mg/kg, with dosing at Q3 weeks. Preferably, dose
   ranges can be in the range from about 0.22 mg/kg to about 2.3 mg/kg.
