   Background
            Firefighting foam concentrates contain mixtures of surfactants that act as foaming
   agents, together with solvents and other additives that provide the desired mechanical and
   chemical properties for the foam. The concentrates are mixed with water in situ and foamed
15 by mechanical means, and the resulting foam is projected onto the fire, typically onto the
   surface of a burning liquid. The concentrates are typically used at a concentration of about 1
   6%.
            Aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) concentrates are designed to spread an aqueous
   film on the surface of hydrocarbon liquids, which increases the rate at which the fire can be
20 extinguished. This spreading property is made possible by the use of perfluoroalkyl
   surfactants in AFFF, which produce very low surface tension values in solution (15-20 dynes
   cm-1 ), thereby permitting the aqueous solution to spread rapidly on the surface of the
   hydrocarbon liquids.
            However, typical AFFF foams are not effective on fires of water-miscible fuels, such
25 as low molecular weight alcohols, ketones, and esters and the like, because the miscibility of
   the solvent leads to dissolution and destruction of the foam by the fuel. To address this issue,
   alcohol resistant AFFF (AR-AFFF) concentrates are used, which contain a water-soluble
   polymer that precipitates on contact with a water-miscible fuel, creating a protective layer
   between the fuel and the foam. Typical water-soluble polymers used in AR-AFF are
30 polysaccharides, such as xanthan gums. AR-AFFF foams are effective on both hydrocarbon
   and water-soluble fuels.
                                                   -1-

            Conventional AFFF concentrates contain mixtures of perfluoroalkyl and non
   fluorinated surfactants, each of which may be anionic, cationic, nonionic or amphoteric,
   solvents such as glycols and/or glycol ethers, and minor additives such as chelating agents,
   pH buffers, corrosion inhibitors and the like. Various AFFF concentrates are described in,
 5 for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,047,619; 3,257,407; 3,258,423; 3,562,156; 3,621,059;
   3,655.555; 3,661,776; 3,677.347; 3,759.981; 3,772,199; 3,789,265; 3,828,085; 3,839,425;

   and 4,209,407. ARAFFF concentrates are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.
10 4,060,489; U.S. Pat. No. 4,149,599 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,387,032.
            Foam concentrates often must be stored and used at low temperatures. For example,
   the concentrate often must be stored outdoors in a cold climate, or it may be stored inside a
   refrigerated warehouse. Concentrates intended for use under such conditions therefore
   contain one or more freeze suppressants, that depress the freezing point of the concentrate so
15 that it remains liquid and can be proportioned to make foam. Typically, either propylene
   glycol or ethylene glycol are used as the freeze suppressant.
   Summary of the invention
            Aqueous film-firefighting composition concentrates are provided containing
   (a) trimethyl glycine in an amount that is effective to depress the freezing point of the
20 composition below 00 C, (b) an effective amount of at least one surfactant selected from the
   group consisting of anionic, zwitterionic and nonionic surfactants; and (c) an effective
   amount of a foam stabilizing agent. The trimethyl glycine may be present in an amount of
   0.1 to 60 wt%, for example up to 5%, up to 10%, up to 20%, up to 30%, up to 40%, up to
   50% or up to 60 wt%. The foam stabilizing agent may be fluorine containing or may be
25 fluorine free, and may be present in an amount of 0.5-50 wt%.
            The concentrate may further contain a first additional anionic, zwitterionic or
   nonionic surfactant and, optionally, a second additional anionic, zwitterionic or nonionic
   surfactant. The surfactants present may be of different charge types. The surfactants may be
   non-fluorinated and/or fluorine-containing surfactants, such as perfluoroalkyl surfactants.
30 The concentrate may contain a high molecular weight water-soluble polymer that precipitates
   on contact with a water-miscible fuel. In one embodiment, the concentrate may contain or
   more components such as a corrosion inhibitor, a polymeric foam stabilizer, a biocide.
                                                  -2-

            The concentrate may contain, or may be free of, ethylene glycol and/or propylene
   glycol. When TMG and a glycol are present, the freezing point of the concentrate is lower
   than the freezing point of the same concentrate that lacks either trimethyl glycine or the
   glycol.
 5          The concentrate may contain an alkylpolyglycoside in the amount of 0.3 to 15 wt%.
   In another embodiment, the concentrate may contain at least one high molecular weight
   water-soluble polymer, such as a polysaccharide gum and/or acrylic polymer, present in an
   amount up to 5 wt%.
            In one embodiment, the concentrate contains a non-fluorinated surfactant or mixture
10 of non-fluorinated surfactants, and a perfluoroalkyl surfactant or mixture of perfluoroalkyl
   surfactants, where the non-fluorinated surfactant or mixture of non-fluorinated surfactants is
   present in an amount of 0.1 to 50 wt%, and the perfluoroalkyl surfactant or mixture of
   perfluoroalkyl surfactants is present in an amount of 0.3 to 30 wt% and where the foam
   stabilizing agent is present in an amount of 0.5-50 wt%.
15          In another embodiment, the concentrate is substantially free of any organofluorine
   compound, and contains a non-fluorinated surfactant or mixture of non-fluorinated
   surfactants in an amount of 0.1-65 wt%; a polysaccharide gum in an amount of 0.1-5 wt%
   and a foam stabilizer is present in an amount of 0.5-50 wt%.
            In the present context a composition is substantially free of a component when that
20 component is present, if at all, at trace (impurity) levels that are too low to materially affect
   the properties of the composition.
            The concentrate may contain a fatty alcohol, present in an amount up to 5 wt%. Fatty
   alcohols in the present context are alcohols having at least 6 carbon atoms, especially having
   8-20 carbon atoms and more preferably having 8-16 or 12-14 carbon atoms, and one
25 hydroxyl functionality, i.e. one hydroxyl group per molecule. Preference is given to fatty
   alcohols with a terminal hydroxyl group, and especially fatty alcohols with straight-chain and
   saturated alkyl radicals, preferably having more than 6 carbon atoms, especially preferably 8
   20 carbon atoms and more preferably 8-16 or 12-14 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred
   examples of fatty alcohols for use in accordance with the invention are octyl alcohol, lauryl
30 alcohol and myristyl alcohol, including mixtures thereof.;
            Also provided are fire-fighting foams, containing a concentrate composition as
   described above, and an aqueous liquid, such as fresh water, brackish water or seawater.
                                                    -3-

           Further provided are methods of making a fire-fighting foam, by foaming a
   composition as described above with an aqueous liquid, such as fresh water, brackish water
   or seawater.
           Finally, methods of extinguishing a fire are provided in which a foam, prepared as
 5 described above, is sprayed on the fire at a rate effective to extinguish the fire.
   Detailed Description
           Novel foam concentrate compositions are provided that contain trimethyl glycine
   ("TMG" or "betaine") as a freeze suppressant, or as a component in a freeze suppressant
   mixture. Methods of making the concentrates are provided, as are foams made from the
10 concentrates and methods of using these foams for fighting fires. The concentrates have
   improved resistance to freezing compared to convention concentrates, and also are more
   environmentally benign.
           Conventional fire foam concentrates that are intended to be used at low temperature
   contain ethylene glycol as a freeze suppressant that keeps the concentrate liquid at reduced
15 temperature. This allows the concentrate to be pumped and proportioned with water to
   prepare foam. Unfortunately, ethylene glycol is an environmental hazard and its common use
   in deicing solutions at airports has been reported to result in fish kills and reduced
   biodiversity as a result of run off. See., for example, "ETHYLENE GLYCOL: Environmental
   aspects," World Health Organization, Geneva (2000).
20         TMG has previously been reported to have been used as for lowering the freezing
   point of aqueous solutions. Thus, for example, TMG solutions have been used for deicing at
   airports. However, there have not been reports of using TMG as a freeze suppressant in fire
   foam concentrates. The reason for this is likely the charged zwitterionic nature of the small
   TMG molecule, which would be expected to behave essentially as a salt in a foam
25 concentrate. Although some salts, such as magnesium sulfate, are used in small quantities in
   fire foams to change the hardness or softness of the water used to prepare the foam, larger
   quantities of salts are deleterious to foam performance. In particular, salts decrease the
   expansion ratio of foam, shorten the foam drain time, and reduce the bum back time. These
   changes significantly reduce the effectiveness of the foam in extinguishing and securing
30 extinguished fires.
           Surprisingly, however, it has been found that TMG can be used to partially or wholly
   replace ethylene glycol as a freeze suppressant in fire foam concentrates without negatively
   affecting foam expansion ratios, foam drain time, or burnback time. The TMG can be used in
                                                    -4-

   any type of foam concentrate used for preparing fire foams, including simple surfactant
   foams. AFFF and AR-AFFF foams. The TMG can be present in the amount desired to
   provide the necessary depression of the freezing point of the mixture. One skilled in the art
   will recognize that TMG can readily be added to concentrates in incremental amounts and the
 5 effect on freezing point measured, allowing the determination of the wt% of TMG required.
   TMG can be used in amounts of 0.1 to 60 wt% of concentrates, for example, up to 1%, up to
   5%, up to 10%, up to 15%, up to 20%, up to 25%, up to 30%, up to 35%, up to 40%, up to
   45%, up to 50%, up to 55%, or up 60%. Typically TMG is present in an amount that
   depresses the freezing point of the concentrate below 00 C, advantageously below -10 C,
10 20C, -30'C or -40'C.
           Also surprisingly, it has been found that combinations of TMG and ethylene glycol
   and/or propylene glycol in foam concentrates have a synergistic effect in lowering the
   freezing point of a concentrate more effectively than either TMG or a glycol alone. This can
   be useful especially for concentrates that must be used in extreme cold. In fact, combinations
15 of TMG and ethylene glycol have been shown to depress the freezing point of concentrates to
   approximately -70'C. In these synergistic combinations, the TMG may be present in
   amounts up to 50 wt% and the glycol may be present in amounts up to 70 wt%. Exemplary
   combinations of TMG/glycol include, but are not limited to (figures in wt%): 5/10, 50/10,
   5/70, 20/70, 50/40, 35/55, 27.5/10, 5/40, 12.5/70, 50/25, 26/40, 15.5/25, 38/25, 15.5/55,
20 23/55, and 38/40. Typically the ratio of TMG to glycol varies from 1:2 to 2:1, although ratios
   outside these limits also can be used as desired.
           In addition, many fire foam concentrates contain diethylene glycol monobutyl ether
   (butyl carbitol) as a foam stabilizing solvent. Unfortunately, it has been shown that the
   presence of diethylene glycol monobutyl ether in a solution makes it incompatible with TMG,
25 rendering it insoluble. It has been found, however, that adding one or more alkyl sulfate
   detergents, such as octyl and/or decyl sulfates, overcomes this problem, even when the alkyl
   sulfate is present in small amounts.
   Foam concentrates containing TMG
           As described above, TMG and synergistic TMG/glycol combinations can be used in
30 essentially any foam concentrate, including simple concentrates, AFFF, and AR-AFFF
   concentrates. It may also be used in fluorine-free foam concentrates such as those described,
   for example, in WO 2011/050980. As described above, when a concentrate contains TMG it
                                                   -5-

   has been found to be advantageous to include at least sufficient alkyl sulfate surfactant to
   ensure that the diethylene glycol monobutyl ether is fully soluble in the concentrate.
            The concentrates may be produced at any suitable strength, including, but not limited
   to, 1, 3 and 6% (w/w) foam concentrates, which are concentrations that are typical for
 5 commercial use. Concentrates that are less than 1% (w/w) or greater than 6% (w/w) also may
   be prepared. As used herein, the lowest numbered strength for the concentrate used indicates
   the most concentrated product, i.e., the percent designation refers to the proportioning rate of
   foam concentrate to water. Accordingly, one part 1% concentrate used with 99 parts water
   gives 100 parts of use strength pre-mix; similarly, three parts 3% concentrate and 97 parts
10 water gives 100 parts of pre-mix. As used herein, the term "water" may include pure,
   deionized or distilled water, tap or fresh water, sea water, brine, or an aqueous or water
   containing solution or mixture capable of serving as a water component for the fire fighting
   composition.
            Typical components used for preparing AFFF and AR-AFFF concentrates are shown
15 in the table below, together with typical % concentrations (w/w).

            The above components would be reduced or increased accordingly relative to the 3%
   liquid concentrate to prepare 6% and 1% synthetic liquid foam concentrates, or other
   concentrate levels. Thus, for a 1% concentrate, the above amounts may be increased by a
20 factor of 3, whereas for a 6% concentrate the above amounts may be reduced by half.
                                                   -6-

           Fluoropolymer component
           High molecular weight fluoropolymers may be used in an amount to provide a foam
   concentrate that may have from about 0.005% or less to about 6% or more fluorine by weight
   of concentrate, more typically from about 0.0 1% to about 4.5% fluorine by weight of
 5 concentrate.
           Hydrocarbon surfactants
           Zwitterionic or amphoteric hydrocarbon surfactants include, but are not limited to,
   those which contain in the same molecule, amino and carboxy, sulfonic, and sulfuric ester
   moieties and the like. Higher alkyl (C6 -C 4 ) betaines and sulfobetaines are included in this
10 category. Commercially available products include Chembetaine CAS (Lubrizol Inc.) and
   Mirataine CS (Rhodia), both sulfobetaines, and Deriphat 160C (BASF), a C12 amino
   dicarboxylate. These products are foaming agents and help reduce interfacial tension in
   water solution.
           Anionic hydrocarbon surfactants include, but are not limited to, alkyl carboxylates,
15 sulfates, sulfonates, and their ethoxylated derivatives. Alkali metal and ammonium salts are
   suitable. C8 -C16 hydrocarbon surfactants are suitable, including, advantageously, C 8-Cio.
           Nonionic hydrocarbon surfactants help reduce interfacial tension and solubilize other
   components, especially in hard water, sea water or brine solutions. They also serve to control
   foam drainage, foam fluidity, and foam expansion. Suitable nonionic surfactants include, but
20 are not limited to, polyoxyethylene derivatives of alkylphenols,. linear or branched alcohols,
   fatty acids, alkylamines, alkylamides, and acetylenic glycols, alkyl glycosides and
   polyglycosides, as defined in U.S. Pat. No. 5,207,932 (herein incorporated by reference) and
   others, and block polymers of polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene units.
           In the present context, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that reference to
25 surfactants of different charge types refers to, for example, anionic and non-ionic surfactants,
   or anionic and zwitterionic surfactants.
           Fluorocarbonsurfactants
           Fluorochemical surfactants are typically single perfluoro-tail molecules and may have
   multiple hydrophilic heads. Advantageously, the fluorochemical surfactant contains
30 perfluoroalkyl groups no longer than C6 , although C8 and longer fluorosurfactants can also be
   used. Examples of suitable fluorochemical surfactants include those described in
   WO/2012/045080. The quantity of fluorochemical surfactant(s) may be added to increase
   extinguishing speed and burnback resistance.

           Foam aids
            Foam aids may be used to enhance foam expansion and drain properties, while
   providing solubilization and anti-freeze action. Useful foam aids are well known in the art
   and are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,616,273, 3,457,172; 3,422,011 and
 5 3,579,446, which are herein incorporated by reference.
            Typical foam aids include alcohols or ethers such as ethylene glycol monoalkyl
   ethers, diethylene glycol monoalkyl ethers. propylene glycol monoalkyl ethers, dipropylene
   glycol monoalkyl ethers, triethylene glycol monoalkyl ethers, I-butoxyethoxy-2-propanol,
   glycerine, and hexylene glycol.
10          Sequestering, buffer, and corrosionpackage
            The components of the sequestering, buffer, and corrosion package, include agents
   that sequester and chelate metal ions. Examples include polyaminopolycarboxylic acids,
   ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, nitrilotriacetic acid,
   hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid and salts thereof. Buffers are exemplified by
15 Sorensen's phosphate or McIlvaine's citrate buffers. The nature of the corrosion inhibitors is
   limited only by compatibility with other formula components. Typical corrosion inhibitors
   include ortho-phenylphenol, tolyltriazole , and many phosphate ester acids.
           Polymericfilm former
            These water-soluble polymeric film formers, dissolved in AR-AFFF agents,
20 precipitate from solution when the bubbles contact polar solvents and fuel, and form a vapor
   repelling polymer film at the solvent/foam interface, preventing further foam collapse.
   Examples of suitable compounds include thixotropic polysaccharide gums as described in
   U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,957,657; 4,060,132; 4,060,489; 4,306,979; 4,387,032; 4,420,434; 4,424,133;
   4,464,267, 5,218,021, and 5,750,043, which are herein incorporated by reference. Suitable
25 commercially available compounds are marketed as Rhodopol, Keltrol, Actigum, Cecal-gum,
   Galaxy, and Kelzan.

   cellulose, dextran and modified dextrans, neutral glucans, hydroxypropyl cellulose, as well,
                                                   -8-

   as other cellulose ethers and esters. Modified starches include starch esters, ethers, oxidized
   starches, and enzymatically digested starches.
            Antimicrobials andpreservatives
            These components may be used to prevent biological decomposition of natural
 5 product based polymers incorporated as polymeric film formers. Examples include Kathon
   CG/ICP (Rohm & Haas Company)and Givgard G-4 40 (Givaudan, Inc.), and are disclosed in
   U.S. Pat. No. 5,207,932, which is herein incorporated by reference. Additional preservatives
   are disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 3,957,657; 4,060,132; 4,060,489; 4,306.979; 4,387,032;
   4,420,434; 4,424,133; 4,464,267, 5,218,021, and 5,750,043.
10          Electrolytes
            Electrolytes may be added to AFFF's and AR-AFFF agents in small amounts to
   balance the performance of such agents when proportioned with water ranging from soft to
   very hard, including sea water or brine, and to improve agent performance in very soft water.
   Typical electrolytes include salts of monovalent or polyvalent metals of Groups 1, 2, or 3, or
15 organic bases. The alkali metals particularly useful are sodium, potassium, and, or the
   alkaline earth metals, especially magnesium. Organic bases might include ammonium,
   trialkylammonium, bis-ammonium salts or the like. The anions of the electrolyte are not
   critical, except that halides may not be desirable due to metal corrosion. Sulfates, bisulfates,
   phosphates, nitrates and the like are commonly used. Examples of polyvalent salts include
20 magnesium sulfate and magnesium nitrate.
            Polymericfoam stabilizers and thickeners
            These components can be optionally incorporated to enhance the foam stability and
   foam drainage properties. Examples of polymeric stabilizers and thickeners include partially
   hydrolyzed protein, starches, polyvinyl resins such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamides,
25 carboxyvinyl polymers, polyvinyl polypyrrolidone, and poly(oxyethylene) glycol.

           Use of TMG and TMG/glycol-containing concentrates
           Concentrate prepared as described above may be mixed with water, typically as a 3%
   solution, and foamed using foaming devices well known in the art. As water under pressure
   passes through a fire hose, typically 3 percent by volume of the concentrate composition is
 5 inducted into the hose line by the Venturi effect to form a foam solution of the concentrate
   diluted with water. The solution becomes aerated to produce a finished foam by use of an
   air-aspirating nozzle located at the outlet end of the hose. A foam solution stored for any
   length of time prior to aeration is known as a foam premix and can likewise be aerated to
   produce a finished foam. Equipment which can be used to produce and apply these aqueous
10 air-foams are known in the art and also are described in publications by the National Fire
   Protection Association.
           The concentrate, upon dilution with water and aeration, produces an aqueous film
   forming foam which is applied to a body of flammable liquid such as a spill or pool which is
   burning or subject to ignition. The foam extinguishes the burning liquid, and prevents further
15 ignition by providing a blanket to cover the fuel surface and excluding air.
           Preferably, the compositions are introduced into a fire or flame in an amount
   sufficient to extinguish the fire or flame. One skilled in the art will recognize that the amount
   of extinguishing composition needed to extinguish a particular hazard will depend upon the
   nature and extent of the hazard.

   Fire Test Results
           Formulations similar to the AR-AFFF formulation above, but containing 30 wt%
   TMG were tested in a standard UL-162 Type III test. Foams were prepared at 3% in both
   fresh water and salt water, and the results are shown below:
25
           3% in Fresh Water
           Fire Extinguishment time:              1 minute 30 seconds
           Burn Back Resistance:                  16%   @ 8 minutes
           Expansion Ratio:                       6.64
30         Drain Time:                            4 minutes 30 seconds
           3% in Salt Water
           Fire Extinguishment time:              2 minutes 5 seconds
                                                  -11-

           Burn Back Resistance:                     14%  @ 8 minutes
           Expansion Ratio:                         6.06
           Drain Time:                              3 minutes 43 seconds
 5         As described above, typically when large amounts of salt are added to a formulation
   this decreases burn back time, significantly lowers the foam expansion ratio, and significantly
   shortens the foam drain time. However, these results above show that TMG present at a
   concentration of 30% had no statistically significant detrimental effect on the foam.
