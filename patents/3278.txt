                                              FIELD
[0002]           The disclosure provides for compounds, compositions, and methods of
reducing dust, for example seed dust, by utilizing a dust reducing composition described
herein. The disclosure also provides for methods of reducing seed dust associated with the
treatment, coating, processing, transportation, storage, and/or planting of seeds by treating a
seed with a composition described herein. Methods and compositions for improving the
homogeneity and dispersion of an active agent on a seed surface are also provided. The
disclosure also provides for methods of treating or washing a seed prior, during the same time
as, or after treatment of a seed with a seed treating agent. Seeds and compositions useful in
these methods are also described.
                                        BACKGROUND
[0003]           There is a need to develop new techniques for reducing and/or mitigating the
amount of seed dust associated with the treatment, coating, and planting of seeds. Depending
on the type of seed coating or treatment employed, seed dust can accumulate during a variety
of situations associated with the processing, shipping, and/or planting of seeds. For instance,
in situations where seeds are pre-treated with a coating agent or composition, placed into
bags and shipped to a location, seed dust can accumulate in seed bags due to seed-to-seed
and/or seed-to-bag interactions. Seed dust can also accumulate during the storage or handling
of seed or seed bags. As such, there is a need to find an alternative to traditional seed
coatings that are capable of limiting dust associated with the treating, coating, planting,
and/or shipping of seeds. To this end, the disclosed compositions and methods have the
ability to reduce and mitigate seed dust in a manner that was not previously recognized.

[00102]        In the disclosure, "flowability" is determined by measuring, in seconds, how
quickly a specified quantity, for example 200 grams, of seeds pass through a funnel. A faster
speed correlates to better, or increased, flowability. In this manner, wheat flowability can be

measured for a control group of untreated seeds and then be compared to wheat flowability
for treated seeds. For similar determinations of flowability, see for example,
W02013166012A1, in which flow is measured as the amount of time, in seconds, required
for 360 grams of coated seeds to pass through a plastic funnel-the shorter the period of time
that is required for a batch of seeds to flow through the funnel, the better the flowability
characteristics of the coated seed.

[00109]           In an aspect, a "wetting agent" refers to compounds added to a liquid in small
quantities in order to enhance the spreading of the liquid on a surface or the penetration of the
liquid into the solid particles in the liquid or/and the solid substrate that gets in contact with
the liquid. Thus an effective wetting agent for coating can be a surfactant that has affinity
groups to solid particles and able to replace air and moisture that traps in the solid particles in
order to spread and penetrate to the surface of the solid particles. In an aspect, wetting agents
are surface active compounds having low molecular weight, less than 4000 g/mol.
[00110]           Wetting agents can be anionic, cationic or nonionic surface active compounds.
Nonionic compounds can be selected from modified polysiloxane esters, sorbitan esters,

[00136]         The method of treatment according to the invention can be used in the
treatment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), e.g. plants or seeds. Genetically
modified plants (or transgenic plants) are plants of which a heterologous gene has been stably
integrated into genome. The expression "heterologous gene" essentially means a gene which
is provided or assembled outside the plant and when introduced in the nuclear, chloroplastic
or mitochondrial genome gives the transformed plant new or improved agronomic or other
properties by expressing a protein or polypeptide of interest or by downregulating or
silencing other gene(s) which are present in the plant (using for example, antisense
technology, cosuppression technology or RNA interference - RNAi - technology). A
heterologous gene that is located in the genome is also called a transgene. A transgene that is
defined by its particular location in the plant genome is called a transformation or transgenic
event.

[00148]         In order to evaluate the properties of the compositions, individual components
were mixed with Imidacloprid 600 g/L before treating seeds. Each component was weighted
and mixed with water to make a 100 parts of adjuvant emulsion in water.
[00149]         Fifty (50) parts of prepared emulsion was mixed with 50 parts of Imidacloprid
to make a 100 parts formulation. Then, 7.1 parts of above formulation, 0.7 parts of red
colorant and 9.9 parts of water were weighted to prepare 17.7 parts of slurry. For 515 grams
of wheat seeds, a 4 mL (cc) of prepared slurry was used. For 515 grams of corn seeds, a 4.35
mL (cc) prepared slurry was used.
[00150]         In Figure 5, the results for dust control on wheat are described in terms of total
grams of dust per 100,000 kernels and per 100 grams of seed. The seeds were treated with
various formulations ("Seed Sample ID" 1 - 12) as measured by a Heubach dust meter. The
results of Figure 5 are depicted graphically in Figure 6. The composition (and weight
percents) of samples 1 - 12 is consistent in Figures 3 - 6 and 8.
[00151]         In Figure 7, a mathematical representation of the influence and significance of
each component was examined on dust mitigation on wheat. The higher absolute number
indicates greater impact of that ingredient on dust control.
Example 3
[00152]         Example 3 sets forth the results of testing the adjuvant formulations on corn
seed.
[00153]         The components listed in Table 6 were evaluated in Figure 8. As set forth in
Figure 8, the dust levels (g/100 kg seed) on corn seed treated with combinations of the
components described in Table 1 where analyzed. In Figure 9, a statistical analysis of the
influence and significance of each ingredient was examined on dust mitigation. The higher
absolute number indicates greater impact of that ingredient on dust control.
Example 4
[00154]         Example 4 sets forth the results of testing the adjuvant formulations on
physical stability of the slurry formulation.
[00155]         The physical stability of the formulations prior to seed application was
assessed with a rating of 1 for best appearance and 10 for worst appearance. The data is
exhibited in Table 5. Components "1 - 12" in Table 5 correspond to the compositions
described in Figure 8.

of each component was evaluated. The higher absolute number indicates greater impact of
that component on physical stability.

grams/liter model formulation testing.
[00158]        Samples for the Imidacloprid 600 g/L system were prepared as follows: For
100 lb wheat seeds, a 12 oz slurry containing G600 (2.4 oz); Red colorant (0.5 oz); Additive
(X oz); Water (9.1-Xoz.). For 515 g wheat seeds, 4 mL (cc) prepared slurry was used. X is
defined by the values in column 6 in Figures 11 A/B/C and Figure 12.
[00159]        In Figure 11, the dust levels in terms of grams per 100 kg Oakes variety wheat

[00162]        Sample preparation for the Imidacloprid 350 g/L system was as follows: For
dust level evaluation, components were mixed with Imidacloprid 600 g/L before treating
                                                30

seeds (PSM series). Each component or mixture of components was weighted before mixing
with water and Imidacloprid 600g/L. Then, 10, 14, 19 or 28 parts of ingredient or mixture of
ingredient were mixed with 61.4 parts of Imidacloprid 600 g/L and corresponding amount of
water to make a 100 parts of Imidacloprid 350 g/L formulation. Next, 9.9 parts of the above
formulation, 1.2 parts of red colorant and 15.5 parts of water were assembled to prepare 26.6
parts of slurry. For 515 grams corn or wheat seeds, 4.35 mL prepared slurry was used.
[00163]          Results of dust control experimentation using Imidacloprid 350 grams/liter as
a model formulation system are shown in Figure 13 for Oakes wheat variety. Results are
shown in terms of grams dust per 100 kg Oakes wheat seed to compare the effect of a variety

a model formulation system are shown in Figure 15 for corn. Results are shown in terms of
grams dust per 100 kg corn seed to compare the influence of a variety of additives.
Example 7
[00166]          Example 7 sets forth experimental results using Imidacloprid plus Thiodicarb
150 + 450 g/L as a formulation model system.
[00167]          Sample preparation was as follows: For design of experiment screening and
combined influence evaluation, each candidate was weighted and mixed with active
ingredients, water, surfactants and other formulants to make a water-based mixture; the
mixture was milled with Eiger mill (bead mill); Rheology modifier (Kelzan) and water were
added in the resulted millbase to make the final 600 g/L formulation. Then, 3.5 volume parts
of 600 g/L formulation, 0.1 volume parts of blue colorant and 1.4 volume parts of water were
mixed to make a slurry ready to treat seeds. For 500 g corn seeds, 5.0 mL (~5.75 g) prepared
slurry was used.

[001691         As set forth in Figure 16, the dust level in terms of grams/100 kilograms of
corn seed in which various combinations of seed coating factors A-H as described in Table 5
were examined using the Imidacloprid plus Thiodicarb 150 + 450 g/L formulation model
system. For the column labeled "PPG/GLC", a positive sign indicates the presence of
propylene glycol while a minus sign indicates glycerin. For the column labeled "8/4", a
positive sign indicates 8% and a negative sign indicates 4% and denotes the weight % amount
of wither propylene glycol or glycerin. For the column labeled D425 (0.5/0), a positive sign
indicates presence of Morwet D425 in an amount of 0.5% wt and a negative sign indicates
the absence of Morwet D425. For the column labeled VA64 (SLN 50)10100, a positive sign
indicates the presence of Luvitec VA64 and a negative sign indicates the presence of Genapol
0-100. For the next column, a positive sign indicates 4% wt and a negative sign indicates
0% wt of either Luvitec 64 or Genapol 0-100. In the column labeled S778/IMN (DPN 50), a
positive sign indicates the presence of Styronal 778 while a negative sign indicates the
presence of Impranil DLN 50. For the next column, a positive sign indicates 4% wt and a
negative sign indicates 0% wt of either Styronal 778 or Styronal 778. For the column labeled
KEL (0.1/0.5), a positive sign indicates the presence of Kelzan S (2%) at 0.1% while a
negative sign indicates the presence of Kelzan S (2%) at 0.05%.
[00170]         In Figure 17, a mathematical representation of the effect and significance of
each factor examined on dust mitigation on dust control in corn is described. The higher
absolute number indicates greater impact of that ingredient on dust control.
Example 8
[00171]         Example 8 sets forth the impact of particle size of the active ingredient on dust
levels.
[00172]         In Figure 18, dust levels are set forth from experiments using the Imidacloprid
FS 600 g/L formulation model system and wheat variety Oakes seeds while varying the
particle size. Column 4 presents the particle size.

   WO 2014/146144                                                           PCT/US2014/033815
[00173]         The data are presented graphically in Figure 19. As can be seen, there is a
direct correlation between particle size and dust levels. As active ingredient particle size
increases, the amount of dust on the seed increases.
Example 9
[00174]         Example 9 sets forth an analysis of surface coverage of the tested formulations
and dust level.
[00175]         Wheat or corn seeds are treated with the seed treatment composition (slurry)
by a Hege seed treatment device, where the slurry is atomized and coat the seeds uniformly.
[00176]         The treated seeds are kept open to ambient environment for 5 days and then
stored in a constant climate chamber for minimum of 48 hours at 20 "C ± 2 "C and 50 % ± 10
% relative humidity. The amount of dust coming off the seeds is measured using a Heubach
dustmeter. About 100 grams of treated seeds are placed in a chamber. The chamber is rotated
to generate friction among the seeds and between the chamber wall and the seeds, which
simulate the handling of the treated seeds. A constant airflow passes through the chamber
controlled by a precision vacuum system. The flow of air carries air borne particles through a
coarse filter separator onto a glass fiber filter disc. The Heubach dust values can be calculated
by measuring the weight of filter disc before and after the evaluation test.
[00177]         A qualitative assessment of seed coating using microscopic imaging was
conducted. Untreated wheat seed surface is uneven, containing ridges, pitts, and valleys.
This is shown in Figure 20.
[00178]         Treated seeds with poor surface coverage have only ridges covered and show a
higher level of dust. Such dust coverage is shown in Figures 21 and 22.
[00179]         Treated seeds with lower level of dust have a higher percentage of surface
coverage of formulation with both ridges and valleys covered. This is shown in Figures 23
and 24.
[00180]         Imaging analysis was performed comparing the seed coverage of Figure 22
(poor surface coverage) with that of Figure 24 (good surface coverage). In a first imaging
analysis, the seed of Figure 22 possessed 46% coverage whereas the seed of Figure 24
possessed 68% coverage. In a second imaging analysis, the seed of Figure 24 possessed 49%
coverage whereas the seed of Figure 24 possessed 73% coverage.

[00181]         Example 10 sets forth the influence of single component compositions on dust
mitigation.
