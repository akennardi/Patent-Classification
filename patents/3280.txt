Abstract
A Mobile application System and methods to provide convenient ways for
passengers to find the cheapest and competitive taxi fares by utilising
inventive fare biding algorithms, designed for taxi and private ride sharing
industry.
The system provides functionality to participating drivers where they
receive the route request on their computing devices and input their
lowest bid to win the fare.

BACKGROUND
[0001] some ride sharing and taxi apps provide system calculated
inclusive of surge pricing or fixed fares to the passengers. No systems
exist in the industry where group of drivers could compete with each
other to win a requested fare.
[0002] The system is designed to provide all basic and advance features
of computing devices i.e. geographic location services, notifications, all
other forms of mobile communications, payment gateway, estimated
fares, suggested fares, hailing, advance booking, multiple hire through
advance bidding algorithms.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0003] FIG. 1 illustrates a system context diagram of an example cab
bidding system that can be utilised to embody or give effect to a
particular embodiment;

                                      2
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0004] Examples described herein provide for a cab bidding system where
a user can book a cab or private car by involving participating drivers,
leveraging system's bidding algorithms. In one example the passenger
selects or sets his or her pickup and destination location to define a
journey. The system dispatches the booking request along with the
guided fare to the participating drivers. The driver upon receiving request,
manually input the lowest or highest bid on the guided fare. The system
sends live bid updates to the other participating nearest drivers, where
they can compete with each other to bid. The system sends bid details
with the cab ETA's to the requester, where the user can then assign the
job to the driver he finds more suitable for the journey.
[0005] The System provides automated bidding features to cab drivers
where they could set up their preferences. In one example the driver 'A'
sets a rule in mobile app to automatically allow system on driver's behalf
to bid for any fare/job request by subtracting user specified percentage
from the system generated estimated fare.

                                      3
      I.e. (Estimated fare) = 50$
      Driver 'A' set discounted % for each fare he receives = 10%
      Discounted Fare: 50-5 = 45$
      Driver 'A' ETA = 2 min
[0006] The driver 'B' sets a rule in mobile app to automatically allow
system on driver's behalf to bid for any fare/job request by subtracting
user specified percentage from the system generated guided fare.
      I.e. (Estimated fare) = 50$
      Driver 'B' set discounted % for each fare he receives = 20%
      Discounted Fare: 50-10 = 40$
      Driver 'B' ETA: 7 min

                                       4
[0007] The driver 'C' who is also nearby and is monitoring the live fare
auction on his computing device decides to manually outbid all of the
drivers by bidding lowest amount: 37$ with ETA 3 min.
[0008] All bids data is then shown to the user where he then assigns the
job to the most suitable driver i.e. the driver 'C'.
Once the job is assigned the taxi driver accepts it and journey begins with
mutually agreed fare.
[0009] The System also provides counterbid methods where the user can
counterbid and could make a counter offer to the taxi drivers.
[0010] The system provides multi share rides through bidding system,
enabling multiple rides in one taxi. Thus further reducing fares of each
passenger. In one example the user creates a journey. Agrees to the ride
sharing/multiple hire and request goes through the bidding system and
user assigns a job to a winning bidder.
[0011] The driver starts current journey with the passenger, along route
and within configured km's radius a sharing request come through the
system, system determines the available current capacity in the cab. If
existing passenger accepts it the driver accepts to put automated bid on
it.
[0012] The bid then gets transmitted to the other shared/unshared
participants drivers who participate in the counterbidding process.

                                       5
[0013] The bidding with ETA information is passed on the requester who
then assigns the job to the suitable winner.
[0014] System calculates the share fare for second passenger and applies
more discounts to passenger 1 according to below formulae.
[0015] The maximum fare that can be charged to each hirer is      7 5% of
the standard authorised fare for the hirer's section of the journey. For
example a passenger and her friend hire a taxi from Terminal 2 at Sydney
Airport and want to go to Circular Quay. The woman agrees to allow the
taxi driver to multiple hire and a gentleman going to Central Railway gets
into the cab.   On arrival at Central Railway, the driver stops the
meter. If the total fare is $30, the driver charges the man $22.50 which
is 7 5%  of $30. The driver restarts the meter and takes the woman and
her friend to Circular Quay, whereupon the total fare is $44 and the
woman is charged $33 which is 7 5% of $44.
