Latex Functionalized with Structural Units of an Arginine Functionalized Monomer
Background of the Invention
[0001]      The present invention relates to a composition comprising a stable aqueous dispersion
of polymer particles (i.e., a latex) functionalized with structural units of an arginine
functionalized monomer. The composition of the present invention is useful in coating
formulations.
[0002]      Exceptional stain resistance and/or stain blocking of coatings formulated with
coatings-grade emulsion polymers is a continuing challenge for formulators, in part because it is
often difficult to balance improvements in stain resistance with a concomitant adverse impact on
other paint performance properties. To add to the complexity of the problem, an improvement in
hydrophobic stain resistance often correlates with a detriment to hydrophilic stain resistance.
[0003]      For example, it is known that using concentrations of sodium lauryl sulfate surfactant
exceeding 2 weight percent can have a positive impact on many hydrophobic stains, but can also
compromise water resistance and hydrophilic stain resistance, as well as exacerbate surfactant
leeching and water spotting.
[0004]      Incorporating phosphoethyl methacrylate (PEM) into binders in coatings formulations
can greatly improve resistance to hydrophilic stains (coffee, in particular); nevertheless, PEM is
known to exacerbate grit formation during the paint making process. Additionally,
PEM-containing polymers often exhibit limited compatibility in the presence of certain
formulation raw materials (such as certain types of attapulgite or bentonite clays).
[0005]      Ethyl acrylate (EA) functionalized polymer particles are particularly resistant to
lipstick stains, but concentrations of EA exceeding 20% of the total latex particle composition
are often required to see this effect, thereby limiting other monomer choices. Moreover, EA has
a very low odor threshold, therefore requiring extensive and sometimes costly chasing of residual
monomer.
[0006]      Additionally, many of the acid monomers or adjuncts that are used to achieve colloidal
stability, such as surfactants and persulfates, can have a negative impact on stain resistance.
Accordingly, it would be an advance in the art of stain resistance to find a way to strike a better
balance between stain resistance and other performance properties.

[0011]      As used herein, the term "aqueous dispersion of polymer particles" is synonymous
with the word "latex."
[0012]      As used herein, the term "structural unit" refers to the remnant of a monomer after
polymerization. For example, a structural unit of N 2 -arginine methacrylate is illustrated as
follows:
                                  NH                              0

                                                          HN           0
                             Structural Unit of N2-arginine methacrylate
where the dotted lines represent the points of attachment to the polymer backbone. Preferably,
the concentration of structural units of the arginine functionalized methacrylate in the polymer
particles, preferably N 2-arginine methacrylate in the polymer particles, is from 0.1, more
preferably from 0.2, and most preferably from 0.25 weight percent, to 2, more preferably to 1
and most preferably to 0.75 weight percent based on the weight of the polymer particles. It is
understood that structural units of the arginine functionalized monomer include salts and
zwitterions thereof.
[0013]      N2-Arginine methacrylate can be conveniently prepared by contacting arginine with
methacrylic anhydride at room temperature.
[0014]      Other examples of arginine functionalized methacrylates include N2 -(2-hydroxy-3
(methacryloyloxy)propyl-arginine, which can be prepared by the reaction of N2-arginine and
glycidyl methacrylate:

                               N2 -(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)-arginine
[0015]     As used herein, the term "acid monomer" is an ethylenically unsaturated monomer
that contains an ionizable proton. Suitable classes of acid monomers include carboxylic acid,
sulfur acid, phosphorus acid monomers. Examples of carboxylic acid monomers and salts
thereof include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and itaconic acid and salts thereof; examples of
suitable sulfur acid monomers include sulfoethyl methacrylate, sulfopropyl methacrylate, styrene
sulfonic acid, vinyl sulfonic acid, and 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propanesulfonic acid, and salts
thereof.
                                                  4

[0016]      Examples of suitable phosphorus acid monomers include phosphonates and
dihydrogen phosphate esters of an alcohol in which the alcohol contains or is substituted with a
polymerizable vinyl or olefinic group. Preferred dihydrogen phosphate esters are phosphates of
hydroxyalkyl acrylates or methacrylates, including phosphoethyl methacrylate (PEM) and
phosphopropyl methacrylates. PEM, which is an especially preferred phosphorus acid monomer,
is represented by the following structure:
                                         0
                                                                    OR
                                                                OH
where R is H or
                                              0
[0017]      Preferably, the concentration of structural units of the acid monomer is in the range of
from 0.05, more preferably from 0.1 and most preferably from 0.3 weight percent, to preferably
6, more preferably to 4, and more preferably to 2 weight percent, based on the weight of the
polymer particles. The acid monomer may also be a combination of acid monomers, for
example, a phosphorus acid monomer, preferably at a concentration in the range of from 0.1,
more preferably from 0.2 and most preferably from 0.5 weight percent, to preferably 5, more
preferably to 3, and most preferably to 2 weight percent, based on the weight of the polymer
particles; and a carboxylic acid monomer preferably at a concentration in the range of from 0.1,
more preferably from 0.2 and most preferably from 0.5 weight percent; to preferably 4, more
preferably 2.5 weight percent, based on the weight of the polymer particles.
[0018]      The polymer particles are preferably acrylic-based polymer particles. As used herein,
the term "acrylic-based polymer particles" refers to polymer particles (including seed polymer
particles) that comprise at least 25 weight percent, based on the weight of the polymer particles,
of structural units of methacrylate or acrylate monomers or a combination thereof. Preferably,
the acrylic based polymer particles comprise from 50, more preferably from 80, and most
preferably from 90, to 99.9, more preferably to 98, and most preferably to 96 weight percent
structural units of acrylate or methacrylate monomers or a combination thereof. Preferably, the
polymer particles comprise one or more methacrylate monomers such as methyl methacrylate,
                                                   5

ethyl methacrylate, or butyl methacrylate; and b) one or more acrylate monomers such as ethyl
acrylate, butyl acrylate, 2-propylheptyl acrylate, or 2-ethylhexyl acrylate.
[0019]       The acrylic-based polymer particles may also comprise from 0.1 to 0.5 weight percent
structural units of a multiethylenically unsaturated monomer such as divinyl benzene or allyl
methacrylate, and may also comprise structural units of other monomers such as styrene in the
range of from 5 to 50 weight percent based on the weight of the polymer particles and vinyl
acetate in the range of from 50 to 75 weight percent based on the weight of the polymer particles.
[0020]       The morphology of the polymer particles is not critical. The polymer particles may be
prepared by way of a single stage or by a multistage polymerization reaction; they may have a
spherical morphology or an acorn morphology, whereby a core portion protuberates from a shell
portion of the polymer particles; and they may be pigment-adsorbing (e.g., TiO2-adsorbing)
polymer particles, but need not be.
[0021]       The composition of the present invention further advantageously includes pigments
such as TiO 2 and other additives such as defoamers, surfactants, dispersants, rheology modifiers,
biocides, and neutralizing agents. It has surprisingly been discovered that coating formed from
the composition of the present invention, especially paints, show a marked resistance to lipstick
stains without adversely affecting other performance properties of the paint.
Examples
[0022]       Comparative Example 1 - Preparation of a Bimorphological Adsorbing Latex not
Functionalized with N2 -Arginine Methacrylate
[0023]       A. Core (preform) Synthesis
[0024]       A first monomer emulsion (ME 1) was prepared by mixing deionized water (200 g),
Disponil FES 993 surfactant (43 g, 30% active), butyl acrylate (371.2 g), methyl methacrylate
(195.2 g), allyl methacrylate (9.6 g), phosphoethyl methacrylate (51.2 g, 60% active), and
methacrylic acid (12.8 g). To a 5-L, four necked round bottom flask equipped with a paddle
stirrer, a thermometer, nitrogen inlet, and a reflux condenser was added deionized water (600 g)
and Disponil FES 32 surfactant (43 g, 30% active). The contents of the flask were heated to 85
'C under N2 and stirring was initiated. A portion of ME l (70 g) was then added, quickly
                                                   6

followed by a solution of sodium persulfate (2.56 g) dissolved in deionized water (30 g) followed
by a rinse of deionized water (5 g). After stirring for 10 min, the remainder of MEl, followed by
a rinse (25 g), and an initiator solution of sodium persulfate (0.64 g) dissolved in deionized water
(50 g) were added linearly and separately over 40 min. After the MEl feed was complete, the
contents of the flask were held at 85 'C for 10 min, after which time the co-feed was completed
and the contents of the flask were then held at 85 'C for an additional 10 min. The contents of
the flask were cooled to room temperature and neutralized to pH 3 with a dilute solution of
ammonium hydroxide. The measured particle size using a Brookhaven BI 90 Plus particle
analyzer was 60 - 75 nm and the solids were 40%.

g, 50% active), acrylic acid (10.2 g), and sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate (11.33 g, 90% active).
[0027]      To a 5-L, four necked round bottom flask equipped with a paddle stirrer, a
thermometer, N2 inlet, and a reflux condenser was added deionized water (850 g) and Disponil
FES 993 surfactant (5.65 g, 30% active). The contents of the flask were heated to 84 'C under
N 2 and stirring was initiated. A portion of ME2 (75 g, 3.5% of total monomer) was then added,
quickly followed by an aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate (5.1 g) dissolved in deionized
water (25 g), followed by a rinse of deionized water (5 g). After stirring for 10 min, a portion of
the pre-form from Step A was then added (212.5 g 5.0% of total monomer), followed by addition
of the remainder of ME2 and then a solution containing ammonium persulfate (1.7 g) and
ammonium hydroxide (5 g, 29% active) dissolved in deionized water (55 g), each added linearly
and separately to the flask over a total period of 80 min. The contents of the flask were
maintained at a temperature of 84 'C during the addition of the second monomer emulsion.
When all additions were complete, the vessel containing the second monomer emulsion was
rinsed with deionized water (25 g), which was then added to the flask.
[0028]      The contents of the flask were cooled to 65 'C and a catalyst / activator pair was added
to the flask to reduce residual monomer. TERGITOLTM 15-S-40 surfactant (A Trademark of The
Dow Chemical Company or its Affiliates, 12.15 g, 70% solids) was added. The polymer was
                                                   7

then neutralized to pH 9 with a dilute ammonium hydroxide solution. The measured particle size
using a Brookhaven BI 90 Plus particle analyzer was 122 nm and the solids were 49.5%.

FES 32 surfactant (5.65 g, 30% active). The contents of the flask were heated to 85 'C under N 2
and stirring was initiated. A portion of ME 1 (105 g) was then added, quickly followed by an
aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate (5.1 g) dissolved in deionized water (25 g), followed
by a rinse of deionized water (5 g). After stirring for 10 min, the remainder of MEl and a
solution containing ammonium persulfate (0.67 g) dissolved in deionized water (30 g), were
added linearly and separately to the flask over a total period of 45 min. After the completion of
the addition of ME 1, the vessel containing ME 1 was rinsed with deionized water (25 g), which
was then added to the flask, and the contents of the flask were maintained at a temperature of 85
'C for 15 min. ME2 and a solution containing ammonium persulfate (1.03 g) dissolved in
deionized water (50 g), were added linearly and separately to the flask over a total period of 70
min. After 20 min into the addition of ME2, a solution containing ammonium hydroxide (10 g,
29% active) dissolved in deionized water (20 g) was added linearly and separately to the flask
concurrent with the addition of ME2. When all additions were complete, the vessel containing
ME2 was rinsed with deionized water (25 g), which was then added to the flask.
[0033]      The contents of the flask were cooled to 70 'C and a catalyst / activator pair was added
to the flask to reduce residual monomer. The polymer was then neutralized to pH 9.3 with a
                                                  8

dilute ammonium hydroxide solution. The measured particle size using a Brookhaven BI 90

sulfate (16.59 g, 28% active), butyl acrylate (957.95 g), methyl methacrylate (977.53 g), and
methacrylic acid (19.52g).
[0036]      To a 5-L, four necked round bottom flask equipped with a paddle stirrer, a

sulfate (19.73 g, 28% active), and a solution of sodium carbonate (6.8 g) dissolved in deionized
water (67g). The contents of the flask were heated to 88 'C under N 2 and stirring was initiated.
A portion of the monomer emulsion (59 g) was then added, quickly followed by an aqueous
solution of ammonium persulfate (6.8 g) dissolved in deionized water (25 g) followed by a rinse
of deionized water (5 g). After stirring for 10 min, the remainder of the monomer emulsion and
a solution containing ammonium persulfate (1.04 g) dissolved in deionized water (99 g), were
added separately to the flask over a total period of 65 min. After the completion of the addition
of the monomer emulsion, the vessel containing the monomer emulsion was rinsed with
deionized water (25 g), which was then added to the flask, and the contents of the flask were
maintained at a temperature of 88 'C for 5 min.

[0051]      Procedure for Stain Testing (adapted from ASTM Method D4828)
[0052]      The test paint was cast on a black vinyl chart with 7-mil (wet) Dow applicator, and a
control paint was cast adjacent to the test paint. The paints were dried at 77 'F (25 'C) at 50%
relative humidity for seven days. One-half inch sections were marked across the test panel and
lipstick was applied uniformly to fill in the test area. The stains were allowed to soak in for
about 2 h. A 3" x 4" sponge was soaked in tap water and squeezed out until no more water
dripped from the sponge. The sponge was then attached to a 1-kg abrasion boat and 10 mL of
thoroughly-mixed Leneta Standardized Non-Abrasive Scrub Medium and 15 mL of tap water
were applied to the exposed face of the sponge. The panel was then scrubbed for 100 cycles
with the 1-kg boat using a GARDCO Washability & Wear tester. (Model D10 WA-215 1). The
panel was rinsed thoroughly with water and allowed to dry; the extent of stain removal was rated
using a BYK Spectro-guide 45/0 gloss meter to measure the LAB* values of the scrubbed and
unscrubbed sides of the panels, and AE values were then calculated. Table 4 shows the AE
values for each of the paints. Paints 1 to 3 refers to paints prepared using latexes from Examples
1 to 3; Paints la, Ib, and Ic refer to paints prepared using the latexes from Comparative
Examples 1, 2, and 3.

[0054]     The results show a dramatic improvement in lipstick stain resistance for the paints
containing binder functionalized with N2-arginine methacrylate. It has also been discovered that
other performance properties of the paints such as paint viscosity stability, hiding, scrub
resistance, and block resistance were not adversely affected by the inclusion of such relatively
low concentrations of N 2-arginine methacrylate.
