STAPLING DEVICE WITH RELEASABLE KNIFE CARRIER
BACKGROUND
1.       Technical Description
[0001]    The present disclosure is directed to circular stapling devices and, more particularly, to
circular stapling devices that include a knife carrier that is releasably coupled to a knife carrier
pusher.
2.        Backround of Related Art
[0002]    Conventional circular stapling devices include an elongate body and a shell or reload
assembly supported on a distal end of the elongate body. The reload assembly includes a staple
cartridge that supports a plurality of staples, a pusher that is movable in relation to the staple
cartridge to eject staples from the staple cartridge, a knife, and a knife carrier that supports the
knife and is movable through the staple cartridge to core tissue. The surgical stapling device also
includes a pusher drive member and a knife carrier pusher that are supported within the elongate
body. The pusher drive member is engaged with the staple pusher and is movable to move the
staple pusher to eject staples from the staple cartridge. Similarly, the knife carrier pusher is
engaged with the knife carrier and is movable to effect movement of the knife carrier to core
tissue. In some circular stapling devices, the knife carrier pusher and the knife carrier are
separable to facilitate separation of the reload assembly from the elongate body of the surgical
stapling device.
[0003]    In current designs, a back angle is formed on the knife carrier pusher to facilitate
separation of the knife carrier pusher from the knife carrier. In these designs, if the back angle
selected is too small, the knife carrier can be damaged upon removal of the reload from the
elongate body, and if the back angle selected is too large, disengagement of the knife carrier
pusher from the knife carrier can occur prematurely such that full retraction of the knife is not
achieved.
[0004]    A need exists in the stapling arts for a simple but reliable mechanism to effect
engagement and disengagement of the knife carrier and the knife carrier pusher at the
appropriate times.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0041]    The presently disclosed circular stapling device will now be described in detail with
reference to the drawings in which like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding
elements in each of the several views. In this description, the term "proximal" is used generally
to refer to that portion of the stapling device that is closer to a clinician, while the term "distal"
is used generally to refer to that portion of the stapling device that is farther from the clinician.

                                                    6
In addition, the term "clinician" is used generally to refer to medical personnel including
doctors, surgeons, nurses, and support personnel.
[0042]    The presently disclosed circular stapling device includes a shell or reload assembly that
is supported on a distal end of an elongate shaft of the stapling device. The reload assembly
includes a housing having an inner housing portion defining a through bore, a staple cartridge
that supports a plurality of annular rows of staples, a staple pusher assembly, a knife carrier, and
an annular knife supported on the knife carrier. The elongate body includes a pusher drive
member and a knife carrier pusher. The knife carrier includes resilient legs that are movable
from a first position engaged with the knife carrier pusher to couple the knife carrier to the knife
carrier pusher to a second position disengaged from the knife carrier pusher. A reload insert is
supported within a through bore of an inner housing portion of the reload assembly and includes
a first portion configured to retain the resilient legs in the first position and a second portion
configured to accommodate movement of the resilient legs from the first position to the second
position.
[0043]    In a pre-fired state of the stapling device, the pusher drive member and the pusher are
positioned to retain the resilient legs of the knife carrier in engagement with the knife carrier
pusher. After the stapling device is fired as the knife carrier and knife are being retracted into
the housing of the reload assembly, the reload insert is positioned and configured to prevent
inward movement of the resilient legs of the knife carrier until the knife has been fully retracted
into the housing. When the knife has been fully retracted into the housing of the reload
assembly, the tapered portion of the reload insert is positioned and configured to accommodate
inward movement of the resilient legs of the knife carrier to facilitate disengagement of the knife
carrier from the knife carrier pusher as described in detail below. The presently disclosed reload
insert minimizes the likelihood of premature separation of the knife carrier from the knife carrier
pusher while reducing the force required to effect separation of the knife carrier from the knife
carrier pusher after the knife has been fully retracted into the housing.
[0044]    FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate an exemplary embodiment of the presently disclosed surgical
stapling device 10. The stapling device 10 includes a handle assembly 12, an elongate body or
adaptor assembly 14, a reload assembly 16, and an anvil assembly 18 supported for movement
in relation to the reload assembly 16 between spaced and approximated positions as is known in
the art. The reload assembly 16 includes a proximal end 16a that is releasably coupled to a distal
end 14a of the elongate body 14. The handle assembly 12 includes a stationary grip 22, and

                                                   7
actuation buttons 24 for controlling operation of the various functions of the stapling device 10
including approximation of the reload and anvil assemblies 16, 18, firing of staples (not shown)
from the reload 16, and cutting of tissue. Although the surgical stapling device 10 is illustrated
as an electrically powered stapling device including an electrically powered handle assembly 12
and an elongate body 14 in the form of an adaptor assembly that translates power from the
handle assembly 12 to the reload and anvil assemblies 16, 18, it is envisioned that the present
disclosure could also be incorporated into a manually powered stapling device. Examples of
electrically powered stapling devices can be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 9,023,014 ("the '014
Patent"), and 9,055,943 ("the '943 Patent) which are incorporated herein by reference in their
entirety. Alternately, the device 10 can be configured for attachment to a robotic system and
need not include a handle assembly.
[0045]    Referring to FIGS. 2A-3, the reload assembly 16 includes a housing 26, a pusher
assembly 28, a knife carrier 30, an annular knife 32 supported on the knife carrier 30, a staple
cartridge 34, staples 36 supported within the staple cartridge 34, and a reload insert 39. The
staple cartridge 34 defines annular rows of staple pockets 40 (FIG. 3). Each of the staple pockets
40 supports one of the staples 36. The pusher assembly 28 includes an annular pusher 42 and a
staple pushing member 44 that together define a longitudinal through bore 28a. The pusher 42
has a distal end that engages a proximal end of the staple pushing member 44 such that distal
movement of the pusher 42 within the housing 26 effects distal movement of the staple pushing
member 44 within the housing 26. The staple pushing member 44 of the reload 16 has a
plurality of fingers 46. Each of the plurality of fingers 46 is received within a respective one of
the staple pockets 40 of the staple cartridge 34 and is movable through the staple pocket 40 to
eject the staple 36 from the staple pocket 40 when the staple pushing member 44 is moved
distally within the housing 26 from a retracted position to an advanced position.
[0046]    The reload insert 39 is fixedly secured to an inner housing portion 26a (FIG. 6) of the
housing 26 and defines a through bore 41. The anvil assembly 18 includes an anvil shaft 18a
that is movable within the through bore 41 as the anvil assembly 18 moves between the spaced
and approximated positions in relation to the staple cartridge 34. Referring also to FIG. 4, the
knife carrier 30 is movably supported within the through bore 28a of the pusher assembly 28
and includes a substantially cylindrical distal portion 50 and a substantially cylindrical smaller
diameter proximal portion 52. The smaller diameter proximal portion 52 is defined by a plurality
of spaced resilient legs 53 that define slots 54 therebetween. The slots 54 receive projections

                                                    8
(not shown) defined within the pusher 42 to guide movement of the knife carrier 30 from a
retracted position to an advanced position within the pusher assembly 28. The longitudinal slots
54 also facilitate inward flexing of the resilient legs 53 of the knife carrier 30 to facilitate
engagement and disengagement of the knife carrier 30 and the knife carrier pusher 70. The knife
32 is secured about the distal portion 50 of the knife carrier 30 such as by crimping. Alternately,
other fastening techniques can be used to secure the knife 32 to the knife carrier 30. In
embodiments, a distal-most portion 50a of the distal portion 50 of the knife carrier 30 is recessed
to receive the annular knife 32.
[0047]     Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, each of the resilient legs 53 of the knife carrier 30 defines a
longitudinal axis and includes first engagement structure 60 that is configured to engage a distal
end of a knife carrier pusher 70 (FIG. 5) of the elongate body 14 as described in detail below to
releasably couple the knife carrier 30 to the knife carrier pusher 70 (FIG. 5). In embodiments,
the first engagement structure 60 includes an annular channel 60a that is configured to receive
second engagement structure 80 (FIG. 5) formed on a distal end of the knife carrier pusher 70 as
described in further detail below. The annular channel 60a of the first engagement structure 60
is defined by distal and proximal walls 61, 63, wherein the proximal wall 63 is orthogonal in
relation to a longitudinal axis of the knife carrier 30. In embodiments, a proximal end 53a of
each resilient leg 53 of the knife carrier 30 is tapered inwardly towards the longitudinal axis in a
proximal direction. The tapered proximal end 53a and the longitudinal slots 54 of the knife
carrier 30 facilitate attachment of the knife carrier 30 to the distal end of the knife carrier pusher
70 as described in detail below.
[0048]     Referring also to FIG. 5, the knife carrier pusher 70 includes a substantially cylindrical
body 74 having a cutout 75 that extends from a central portion of the body 74 to the distal end of
the body 74. In embodiments, the second engagement structure 80 includes an annular
protrusion 81a formed along an inner wall 81 at the distal end of the body 74. The annular
protrusion 81a has a tapered proximal surface 81b (FIG. 5B) defining a back angle Q with a
longitudinal axis of the knife carrier pusher 70 and knife carrier 30. In embodiments, the back
angle Q is between about 15 degrees and about 75 degrees. In other embodiments, the back
angle Q is between about 30 degrees and about 60 degrees.
[0049]     The cylindrical body 74 of the knife carrier pusher 70 defines recesses 84 that are
configured to engage a drive member (not shown) supported within the elongate body 14. The
drive member is secured to the proximal end of the knife carrier pusher 70 and is operable to

                                                    9
advance and retract the knife carrier pusher 70 within the housing 26 of the reload assembly 16
as known in the art. U.S. Publication No. 2016/0106406 ("the '406 Publication") which was
filed on October 6, 2015 discloses such an elongate body or adaptor and is incorporated herein
in its entirety by reference.
[0050]     Referring also to FIGS. 5A and 6, the reload insert 39 defines a through bore 91 and
includes a distal portion 92 and a proximal portion 94. The through bore 91 is dimensioned to
receive the anvil shaft 18a of the anvil assembly 18 when the anvil shaft 18a is connected to an
anvil retainer (not shown) of the stapling device 10 and the anvil assembly 18 is moved between
the spaced and approximated positions in relation to the staple cartridge 34. The distal portion
92 of the reload insert 39 is dimensioned to be fixedly received within the through bore 41
defined by the inner housing portion 26a (FIG. 6) of the housing 26. In embodiments, the distal
portion 92 is substantially cylindrical and includes a series of spaced rings 96. When the distal
portion 92 of the reload insert 39 is positioned within the through bore 26a, the spaced rings 96
engage an inner wall of the inner housing portion 26a of the housing 26 to fixedly retain the
reload insert 39 within the housing 26.
[0051]     The proximal portion 94 of the reload insert 39 has a first cylindrical portion 94a and a
second frusto-conical or tapered portion 94b that tapers inwardly from the cylindrical portion
94a towards a longitudinal axis of the reload insert 39 in a proximal direction. The cylindrical
portion 94a of the reload insert 39 is configured to prevent inward movement of the resilient
legs 53 of the knife carrier 30 to retain the resilient legs 53 in an engaged state with the knife
carrier pusher 70 when the knife carrier 30 is positioned distally of its retracted position and the
distal end of the knife 32 is positioned externally of the housing 26. When the knife carrier
pusher 70 is moved to a fully retracted position such that the knife 32 is withdrawn into the
housing 26 of the reload assembly 16, the tapered portion 94b of the reload insert 39 is
positioned to accommodate inward pivotal movement of the resilient legs 53 of the knife carrier
30 to facilitate engagement and disengagement of the knife carrier 30 and the knife carrier
pusher 70.
[0052]     Although illustrated as a separate component, it is envisioned that the insert 39 can be
integrally formed with the inner housing portion 26a of the reload assembly 16.
[0053]     FIGS. 6 and 6A illustrate the stapling device 10 in a pre-fired state. In the pre-fired
state, the pusher assembly 28 and the knife carrier 30 of the reload 16, and the knife carrier

                                                   10
pusher 70 and the pusher drive member 90 of the elongate body 14 are in retracted positions. In
their retracted positions, the pusher assembly 28 and the pusher drive member 90 extend about
an interface 106 between the first engagement structure 60 on the proximal end of the resilient
legs 53 of the knife carrier 30 and the second engagement structure 80 positioned on the distal
end of the knife carrier pusher 70. In this state, the knife carrier 30 and the knife carrier pusher
70 are engaged.
[0054] When the knife carrier pusher 70 is in its retracted position, the reload insert 39 is
positioned within the knife carrier 30 such that the tapered portion 94b of the reload insert 39 is
positioned adjacent the interface 106 between the first engagement structure 60 on the proximal
end of the knife carrier 30 and the second engagement structure 80 on the knife carrier pusher
70. Positioning the interface 106 for the first and second engagement structures 60, 80 adjacent
the tapered portion 94b of the reload insert 39 in the retracted position allows the reload 16 to be
secured to the elongate body 14 prior to actuation of the stapling device 10. More specifically,
as shown in FIG. 6B, when the reload 16 is inserted into the distal end of the elongate body 14
in the direction indicated by arrow "A" to attach the reload 16 to the elongate body 14, the
tapered proximal ends 52a of the resilient legs 53 engage the a flat distal face 108 of the knife
carrier pusher 70. When this occurs, the tapered proximal ends 52a of the resilient legs 53 are
cammed inwardly to flex the resilient legs 53 inwardly and allow the first engagement structure
60 to move into engagement with the second engagement structure 80. The tapered portion 94b
of the reload insert 39 provides space to accommodate the inwardly flexing legs 53 and thereby
facilitate engagement of the first and second engagement structures 60, 80.
[0055]     FIG. 6C illustrates the stapling device 10 in a post-fired state with the pusher assembly
28 and the pusher drive member 90 in advanced positions and the knife carrier 30, the knife 32,
and the knife carrier pusher 70 in retracted positions. In this state, the interface 106 between the
first and second engagement structures 60, 80 of the knife carrier 30 and the knife carrier pusher
70, respectively, is positioned within the pusher drive member 90 and the staples 36 (FIG. 3)
have been ejected from the staple cartridge 34.
[0056]     FIG. 7 illustrates the stapling device 10 in a post-fired state after the knife carrier
pusher 70 and the knife 32 have been advanced. In this state, the pusher assembly 28, the pusher
drive member 90, the knife carrier 30 and the knife carrier pusher 70 are in advanced positions,
and the interface 106 between the first and second engagement structures 60, 80 of the knife
carrier 30 and the knife carrier pusher 70, respectively, is positioned within the pusher drive

                                                    11
member 90 distally of the tapered portion 94b of the reload insert 39 adjacent cylindrical portion
94a of the reload insert 39. Thus, inward movement of the resilient legs 53 of the knife carrier
30 is prevented and the knife carrier 30 and the knife carrier pusher 70 remain in engagement.
[0057]     Referring to FIG. 8, after the staples 36 (FIG. 3) have been fired and tissue has been
cut, the knife carrier pusher 70 is retracted to retract the knife carrier 30. As the knife carrier
pusher 70 is retracted, the tapered proximal surface 81 b defining the back angle Q (FIG. 5B) on
the annular protrusion 81 a of the second engagement structure 80 of the knife carrier pusher 70
is pulled against a proximal wall 98 defining the annular channel 60a of the first engagement
structure 60. This force of proximal surface 81b on proximal wall 98 urges the flexible legs 53
of the first engagement structure 60 inwardly (FIG. 6A). However, the cylindrical portion 94a of
the reload insert 39 is positioned to prevent inward movement of the flexible legs 53 of the knife
carrier 30 until the knife 32 is fully retracted into the housing 26 and the flexible legs 53 are
aligned with the tapered portion 94b of the reload insert 39. When the flexible legs 53 are
aligned with the tapered portion 94b of the reload insert 39, the force of the proximal surface
81b of the second engagement structure 80 on proximal wall 98 of the first engagement structure
60 urges the flexible legs 53 of the first engagement structure 60 inwardly in the direction
indicated by arrows "B" to effect separation of the knife carrier pusher 70 from the knife carrier
30. The tapered reload insert 39 functions to control the timing of separation between the knife
carrier 30 from the knife carrier pusher 70 to minimize the likelihood of premature separation of
the knife carrier 30 from the knife carrier pusher 70 while minimizing the force required to
effect separation of the knife carrier 30 and the knife carrier pusher 70.
[0058]    Persons skilled in the art will understand that the devices and methods specifically
described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings are non-limiting exemplary
