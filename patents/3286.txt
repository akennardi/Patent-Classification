                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0005]      HCMV is an ubiquitous virus that is present in over 60% of the population depending
on socioeconomic status. Following primary infection, HCMV persists for the life span of the
host. Although HCMV is generally benign in healthy individuals, the virus can cause devastating
disease in immunocompromised populations resulting in high morbidity and mortality (for
review, see (Pass, R. F. 2001. Cytomegalovirus, p. 2675-2705. In P. M. H. David M. Knipe,
Diane E. Griffin, Robert A. Lamb Malcolm A. Martin, Bernard Roizman and Stephen E. Straus
(ed.), Fields Virology, 4th ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia)). Recent increases
in the number of patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy following solid organ (SOT)
or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), as well as the expanded use of HCT for
diseases such as sickle cell anemia, multiple sclerosis and solid cancers have increased the
number of patient populations susceptible to HCMV disease (Chou, S. 1999. Transpl Infect Dis
1:105-14, Nichols, W. G., and M. Boeckh. 2000. J Clin Virol 16:25-40 and Sepkowitz, K. A.
2002. Clin Infect Dis 34:1098-107). HCMV is also the most common congenital viral infection,
and the leading infectious cause of central nervous system maldevelopment in neonates (Fowler,
K. B. et al. 1997. J Pediatr 130:624-30, Larke, R. P. et al.1980. J Infect Dis 142:647-53 and
Peckham, C. S. et al. 1983. Lancet 1:1352-5). In this regard, HCMV is considered the major
cause of sensorineural deafness in neonates independent of infectious status (Fowler, K. B. et al.
1997. J Pediatr 130:624-30). HCMV therefore remains a major cause of mortality in multiple
patient populations emphasizing the need for new antiviral pharmacologic and vaccine strategies.
Immunity induced by natural wild-type (WT) CMV infection has consistently been shown
unable to prevent CMV re-infection (see below). This unique characteristic of CMV presumably
explains the poor efficacy of candidate vaccines in trials to prevent CMV infection (Pass, R. F. et
al. 2009. N Engl J Med 360:1191-9). Nevertheless, immunity to HCMV acquired through natural
infection has been shown to significantly decrease maternal to fetal transmission of HCMV
during pregnancy. This observation would indicate that induction of an immunity in pregnant
women that is comparable to that induced by natural CMV infection, but that is induced in a safe
manner, may be able to decrease maternal to fetal transmission and have a significant impact on
clinical CMV disease in the neonate. HCMV-specific T cell immunity has also been shown to
                                                2

afford protection against CMV disease in transplant patients, presenting another population
wherein the ability to safely induce an immunity comparable to that acquired by natural CMV
infection would have a clinical impact on CMV disease (Leen, A. M., and H. E. Heslop. 2008.
Br J Haematol 143:169-79, Riddell, S. R., and P. D. Greenberg. 2000. J Antimicrob Chemother
45 Suppl T3:35-43 and Riddell, S. R. et al. 1994. Bone Marrow Transplantation 14:78-84).
Cytomegalovirus is highly immunogenic, but has evolved immune evasion mechanisms to
enable virus persistence and re-infection of the sero-positive host:
[0006]      The immunological resources specifically devoted to controlling HCMV infection are
enormous, with CMV being one of the most immunogenic viruses known. High antibody titers
are directed against the main HCMV envelope glycoprotein (gB) during primary infection of
healthy individuals (Alberola, J. et al. 2000. J Clin Virol 16:113-22 and Rasmussen, L. et al..
1991. J Infect Dis 164:835-42), and against multiple viral proteins (both structural and non
structural) during MCMV infection of mice (Farrell, H. E., and G. R. Shellam. 1989. J Gen Virol
70 ( Pt 10):2573-86). A large proportion of the host T cell repertoire is also directed against
CMV antigens, with 5-10 fold higher median CD4+ T cell response frequencies to HCMV than
to acute viruses (measles, mumps, influenza, adenovirus) or even other persistent viruses such as
herpes simplex and varicella-zoster viruses (Sylwester, A. W. et al.. 2005. J Exp Med 202:673
85). A high frequency of CD8+ responses to defined HCMV epitopes or proteins is also
commonly observed (Gillespie, G. M. et al. 2000. J Virol 74:8140-50, Kern, F. et al. 2002. J
Infect Dis 185:1709-16, Kern, F. et al. 1999. Eur J Immunol 29:2908-15, Kern, F. et al.. 1999. J
Virol 73:8179-84 and Sylwester, A. W. et al.. 2005. J Exp Med 202:673-85). In a large-scale
human study quantifying CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to the entire HCMV genome, the
mean frequencies of CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells exceeded 10% of the memory
population for both subsets (Sylwester, A. W. et al.. 2005. J Exp Med 202:673-85). In this study,
it was not unusual for CMV-specific T cells to account for >25% of the memory T cell repertoire
of a specific individual or at specific tissue sites. The clinical importance of this high level of
CMV-specific immunity is most clearly shown by the occurrence of multi-organ CMV disease in
immune-suppressed individuals during transplantation, and the ability of adoptive transfer of T
cells to protect these patients from CMV disease (Riddell, S. R. et al. 1994. Bone Marrow
Transplantation 14:78-84).
                                                  3

[0007]       Paradoxically, the high levels of CMV-specific immunity are unable to either
eradicate the virus from the healthy infected individual, or confer protection of the CMV sero
positive individual against re-infection. This ability of CMV to escape eradication by the
immune system, and to re-infect the sero-positive host has long been believed to be linked to the
multiple viral immunomodulators encoded by the virus (for review, see (Mocarski, E. S., Jr.
2002. Trends Microbiol 10:332-9)). The HCMV US6 family of proteins (RhCMV homologues:
Rhl82-Rh189) are the most extensively studied of these immunomodulators (Loenen, W. A. et
al.. 2001. Semin Immunol 13:41-9). At least four different genes, US2, US3, US6 and US1I
and the respective RhCMV homologues (Rh182, Rh184, Rh185, and Rh189) - are known to
interfere with assembly and transport of MHC I molecules (Ahn, K. et al. 1996. Proc Natl Acad
Sci U S A 93:10990-5, Ahn, K. et al. 1997. Immunity 6:613-21, Jones, T. R. et al. 1995. J Virol
69:4830-41, Pande, N. T. et al. 2005. J Virol 79:5786-98, Wiertz, E. J. et al. 1996. Cell 84:769
79 and Wiertz, E. J. et al. 1996. Nature 384:432-8). Each of these four molecules interferes at
different essential points of MHC I protein maturation. Briefly, US2 binds to newly synthesized
heavy chain (HC) and reverse translocates the protein through the translocation channel SEC61
back into the cytosol where HC is degraded by the proteasome (Wiertz, E. J. et al. 1996. Cell
84:769-79 and Wiertz, E. J. et al. 1996. Nature 384:432-8). Similarly, US1I ejects MHC I back
out into the cytoplasm (Wiertz, E. J. et al. 1996. Cell 84:769-). US3 and US6 act later in the
MHC-I assembly process (Ahn, K. et al. 1996. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 93:10990-5 and Ahn,
K. et al. 1997. Immunity 6:613-21), with US3 retaining fully formed heterotrimers in the ER thus
preventing their transport to the cell surface (Ahn, K. et al. 1996. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
93:10990-5 and Jones, T. R. et al. 1996. PNAS USA 93:11327-33), and US6 preventing peptide
transport by TAP (and thus formation of the trimeric complex of HC, P2m and peptide) (Ahn, K.
et al. 1997. Immunity 6:613-21, Hengel, H. et al. 1997. Immunity 6:623-32 and Lehner, P. J. et
al. 1997. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 94:6904-9).
[0008]       Consistent with persistent replication/chronic reactivation within the host, CMV also
induces and maintains a characteristic and unique T cell immune response. Memory T cells
induced by vaccination or infection can be broadly characterized into either effector      (TEM) or
central (TcM) memory, which follow from the distinct functions of these two memory
populations (Cheroutre, H., and L. Madakamutil. 2005. Cell Mol Life Sci 62:2853-66, Mackay,
C. R. et al. 1990. J Exp Med 171:801-17, Masopust, D. et al. 2001. Science 291:2413-7, Sallusto,
                                                   4

F. et al. 1999. Nature 401:708-12 and Wherry, E. J. et al. 2003. Nat Immunol 4:225-34). TEM are
designed for immediate function against the invading pathogen, being highly enriched at
epithelial mucosal surfaces, are polyfunctional expressing high levels of multiple effector
cytokines (expressing TNFa, IFNy, MIP-1            effector molecules), and have high cytotoxic
potential (CD8). TEM and TcM can also be easily distinguished on the basis of cell surface
markers, with TEM being CCR7-, CD28+/- and TcM being CCR7,                CD28+. Multiple studies
indicate that persistently replicating viruses such as CMV maintain a T cell response that is
heavily biased toward the    TEM phenotype (Amyes, E. et al. 2003. J Exp Med 198:903-11, Appay,
V., and S. Rowland-Jones. 2002. J Immunol Methods 268:9, Champagne, P. et al. 2001. Nature
410:106-11, Halwani, R. et al. 2006. Springer Semin Immunopathol 28:197-208 and Robinson,
H. L., and R. R. Amara. 2005. Nat Med 11:S25-32). Indeed, CMV is regarded as the prototypic
inducer of long-term    TEM  (Halwani, R. et al. 2006. Springer Semin Immunopathol 28:197-208,
Holtappels, R. et al. 2000. Journal of Virology 74:11495-503, Robinson, H. L., and R. R. Amara.
2005. Nat Med 11:S25-32 and Sierro, S. et al. 2005. Eur J Immunol 35:1113-23). In contrast,
analysis of T cell responses against non-persistent viruses (ie., influenza virus) in non-acutely
infected humans, or following immunization with live non-persistent virus-based vaccines
(YFV-17D, yellow fever vaccine, or Dryvax smallpox vaccine) shows that following a short
lived effector T cell phenotype, long-term virus-specific memory T cells against these non
persistent viruses is maintained primarily as TcM (Lucas, M. et al. 2004. J Virol 78:7284-7 and
Miller, J. D. et al. 2008. Immunity 28:710-22).

                          BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0022]      The following detailed description, given by way of example, but not intended to
limit the invention solely to the specific embodiments described, may best be understood in
conjunction with the accompanying drawings.
[0023]      FIGS. 1A-IC. CMV-infected rhesus macaques are not protected against super
infection with RhCMV and superinfection of RhCMV-positive animals is independent of viral
dose. (A) At day 0, two cohorts of four RhCMV          animals each were infected subcutaneously
with 102 or 104 PFU of RhCMV(gagL). The SIVgag-specific T cell responses in PBMC or in
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were monitored by flow cytometric analysis of intrcellular
cytokine staining (ICCS) for CD69 and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-u) (S. G. Hansen et al.
                                                  7

Science 328, 5974 (2010)) (see FIGS. 6 and 7). (B) Day of first detection of SIVgag-expressing
virus in the urine or buccal swabs collected at the indicated intervals from each animal in the two
cohorts shown in (A). Also included are results from a third cohort of eight RhCMV animals
inoculated with 107 plaque forming units (PFU) of RhCMV(gagL). Expression of SIVgag was
determined by immunoblot using antibody to SIVgag from viral cocultures (S. G. Hansen et al.
Science 328, 5974 (2010)) . Each circle represents an individual animal. (C) Long-term secretion
of SIVgag-expressing virus. Urine was isolated at the indicated days post-infection (PID) from
each of the RhCMV(gagL)-infected RM, and SIVgag expression was detected from cocultured
virus by immunoblot. For control, a RhCMV-positive animal that did not receive RhCMV(gagL)
was included.
[0024]      FIGS. 2A-2C. Interference with MHC-I assembly is not required for primary
infection of CMV-naive animals. Three cohorts of two RM each were inoculated subcutaneously
with 107 PFU of recombinant AUS2-11(gag), AVIHCEAUS2-11(gag), or RhCMV(gag). AUS2
11(gag) lacks the RhCMV gene region Rh182-Rh189 encoding the homologues of HCMV US2
11 (N.T. Pande et al. J Virol 79:5786 (2005)), AVIHCEAUS2-11(gag) additionally lacks the
RhCMV gene Rh178 encoding the viral inhibitor of heavy chain expression (VIHCE) (C. J.
Powers et al. PLoS Pathog 4:e1000150 (2008).(A) The RhCMV-specific T cell response in
PBMC and the SIVgag-specific T cell response in PBMC and BAL were determined at the
indicated days post-infection using overlapping peptides to RhCMV immediate early genes IEl
and IE2 or SIVgag by flow cytometric analysis of ICCS for CD69, TNF-U, and interferon-Y
(IFN-7) (S. G. Hansen et al. Science 328, 5974 (2010)) (see FIGS. 6 and 7). (B) Immunoblot of
RhCMV-IE2 or SIVgag expressed in cocultures of urine samples obtained from animals infected
with AUS2-11(gag) or AVIHCEAUS2-11(gag). The IE2 blot confirms that the animals were
negative for RhCMV before infection, consistent with results from T cell assays (table 1B). (C)
PCR analysis of viral genomic DNA isolated from viral cocultures at 428 days post-infection.
The presence or absence of indicated ORFs was determined by PCR using specific primers (S.
G. Hansen et al. Science 328, 5974 (2010)). One of the animals infected with RhCMV(gag)
served as a control.
[0025]      FIGS. 3A-3D. US2-1 1-deleted RhCMV is unable to superinfect RhCMV                 rhesus
macaques. (A) A cohort of four RhCMV RM was inoculated subcutaneously with 107 PFU of
AVIHCEAUS2-11 (gag) (AVAU) at days 0 and 91. The CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response to
                                                  8

SIVgag or RhCMV-IE was monitored by flow cytometric analysis of ICCS for CD69, TNF-a,
and IFN-y in PBMC. The percentage of the responding, specific T cells within the overall
memory subset is shown for each time point. At day 154 and again on day 224, the same cohort
was inoculated with 10' PFU of AUS2-11(gag) (AU), and RhCMV-IE and SIVgag-specific T
cell responses were monitored bi-weekly. At day 737, the cohort was inoculated with
AVIHCE(gag) (AV), and the T cell response was monitored as before. At day 989, the cohort
was inoculated with ARh186-8(retanef)        (AR). Besides SIVgag, a T cell response to
SIVrev/nef/tat was detected by ICCS in all four animals (black lines) using corresponding
overlapping peptides. (Inset) A separate cohort of four animals was infected with wild-type
RhCMV(gag), and the RhCMV-IE and SIVgag-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response was
monitored as described above at the indicated time points for 133 days. (B) The CD4+ and CD8+
T cell response to SIVgag in BAL was measured in parallel to the PBMC T cell responses shown
in (A). (C) RhCMV secreted in the urine collected from the cohort infected with RhCMV(gag),
or deletion viruses AVIHCEAUS2-1 1(gag) or AUS2-1 1(gag), labeled ACMV. Virus was isolated
at the indicated days by coculture with telomerized rhesus fibroblasts (TRFs), and cell lysates
were probed for expression of SIVgag by immunoblot. (D) Expression of RhCMV-IE2, SIVgag,
and SIVretanef by virus secreted in urine collected at the indicated days. Note that all animals
were IE2-positive at the onset of the experiment, confirming their RhCMV-positive T cell status

(S. G. Hansen et al. Science 328, 5974 (2010)). Regions of the genome that were altered to create
mutant viruses are shown in detail. All RhCMV ORFs are depicted as arrows that correspond to
the direction of the ORF within the genome. Blue arrows represent genes that downregulate
MHC class I. The RhCMV nomenclature is used for all ORFs (S. G. Hansen et al. J Virol 77,
6620 (2003)). For ORFs with homology to HCMV genes the name of the corresponding HCMV
homologue is shown in brackets.
[0028]      FIG. 6. Response frequency gating strategy. Lymphocytes originating from PBMC
and BAL were stimulated with Ag, stained and collected on a flow cytometer as described in
Example 1. Data was analyzed using a hierarchical gating strategy to delineate Ag-responding
subsets. Gates are depicted here in pink, with corresponding subset names numbered and
displayed above the cytometric plots. For FIG. 1, response frequencies were determined using
the CD69'/TNFu' subset (CD4', cytometric plot 6a; CD8', cytometric plot 8a). Response values
for all other figures were determined using Boolean gating to delineate cells that are CD69+ and
TNFa/IFN-y-, TNFa-/IFN-ft, or TNFa/IFN-f* ("Boolean Responders"; CD4+, cytometric plot
6c; CD8', cytometric plot 8c).
[0029]      FIG. 7. Memory correction gating hierarchy. Cell preparations were stained and the
data collected as described (C. J. Pitcher et al., J Immunol 168, 29 (2002)), followed by
hierarchical analysis shown here. The pink boxes in cytometric plot 2 and 3 indicate the overall
T cell and T cell subset gates, respectively. The memory correction values used for PBMC
response calculations reflect the percentage of the events within the memory gate of CD4+ or
CD8+ T cell-gated profiles (cytometric plots 4 and 5, respectively).

(WT, Cy3 channel, blue) to the RhCMV-DNA-microarray of overlapping oligonucleotides.
Differences in hybridization signals between the reference and test genomes are shown in red as
the ratio of probe intensities for WT versus AVIHCEAUS2-1 1(gag). The second and third panels
show the ratios in probe intensities for WT versus AUS2-11(gag) (AU) and WT versus
AVIHCE(gag) (AV). The bottom panel shows the nucleotide numbers of the RhCMV genome,
depicted in 20 kbp increments. Also indicated are the positions of the VIHCE and US2-11
deletions. Positive red spikes represent signals that are present in the reference, but absent in the
deletion viruses. These spikes correspond to the expected location of the deletions. Note that
significant differences outside the deleted regions were not observed, indicating that the genomes
of the deletion viruses are identical to that of the parental BAC in all but the deleted regions.

challenged weekly until the first above-threshold plasma viral load (>30 copies/ml) with
infection considered to have been initiated by the challenge the prior week. The p values refer to
difference in the fraction of "protected" (red) vs. progressively infected (black) RM in the CMV

RhCMV/SIV (gag/env/rev/nef/tat/pol) vector-containing regimen (Groups A and B), 13 (54%)
manifested initial SIVmac239 infection with a variably-sized burst of plasma viremia followed
by immediate control to below detection. Although protected RM manifested low level viral
blips about once every 10 weeks (which gradually waned to none), overall viral control was
sufficiently early and stringent to preclude any CD4+ target cell depletion, as well as to prevent
induction (Group A) or boosting (Group B) of the anti-SIVenv antibody response.

mAb cM-T807 at the time of inoculation (right panel; 100% CD8+ T cell depletion in blood for
14 days). US2-1 1(gag) (US2-11 KO) RhCMV vectors can infect RhCMV-naive RM, but not
RhCMV+ RM, unless CD8+ T cells are depleted during the first 2 weeks. Infection or lack or
infection was confirmed by isolation or failure of isolation, respectively, of the designated vector

complementing cells (tRFs+pp7l tet). Fibroblasts were infected with the indicated viruses at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Culture supernatant was collected at the indicated days
and the viral titer was determined on pp71-expressing complementing cells. Multi-step growth
                                                13

curves show replication deficiency of only ARhI 10 and ARhI 10(retanef), but not WT RhCMV
on normal tRFs. Rescue of normal growth of ARhI10 and ARh110(retanef) on pp71
complementing cells (cTRF/pp7l) shows that growth deficiency is due to lack of pp71
expression.

infected animals were challenged with 107 PFU of RhCMV AUS2-11(gag) (AUgag) and the T
cell response against RhCMV lysate was measured at the indicated intervals. The absence of a T
cell boost indicates that the animals were protected against AUS2-11 challenge. Lower panels:
Detection of RhCMV in urine collected at the indicated days from two RM infected with

immunoblot using specific antibodies (S. G. Hansen et al. Science 328, 5974 (2010)) . The two
animals infected with RhCMV(gag) secreted RhCMV (as shown by IE expression) because they
were CMV-positive at the onset of the experiment. At day 56, these animals also secreted
SIVgag expressing RhCMV indicating infection. In contrast, the two CMV-negative RM
infected with ARh110 did not secrete RhCMV as indicated by the absence of IE-positive
cocultures up to day 231. This result indicates that ARh1 10 is attenuated in vivo.

encoded by the genes Rh 111 and Rh 112, respectively, was created. Upper panel: ARh 111-112
grows like WT RhCMV in tissue culture. Telomerized rhesus fibroblasts (tRFs) were infected
with the indicated viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Culture supernatant was
collected at the indicated days and the viral titer was determined. Lower left panel: ARh 110-112
induces an IE-specific, but not a pp65-specific T cell response. Two CMV-negative animals (red,
green) were infected with 5x10 6 pfu ARh1 11-112 and one animal was infected with WT RhCMV
(blue) at day 0. CD8+ T cell responses to CMV were measured by intracellular cytokine staining
(TNFalpha and IFNgamma) in broncho-aveolar lavages (BAL, upper panels) or PBMC (lower
panels) using overlapping peptides for RhCMV IE or RhCMV pp65. The panels show the % T
cell reactive to each peptide pool. Lower right panel: RhCMVARh111-112 is secreted from
                                                  14

infected animals. Urine was collected at 56 days post-infection with WT RhCMV (animals
25104 and 25546) or ARh111-112 (animals 22037 and 23016). Expression of RhCMV IE or
RhCMV pp65 was determined from viral cocultures by immunoblot using specific antibodies.
All animals infected with WT and ARh1 11-112 secreted RhCMV as shown by IE expression.
While the virus secreted from WT-infected animals also expressed pp65, this was not observed
for ARhI11-112 because this virus lacks the genes encoding pp65a and pp65b. This
demonstrates that the secreted virus corresponds to ARh111-112 and that this virus is not
attenuated in vivo.
[0047]      FIG. 25. RhCMV lacking pp65 protects against challenge with AUS2-1 1(gag). Two
animals were infected with 5x10       6 pfu ARh111-112 and the T-cell response to SIV gag
(overlapping 15 mers; 4 amino acid overlap) and T-cell response to RhCMV lysate was
determined by ICCS at the indicated days. At day 673, animals were challenged by sub
cutaneous inoculation of 107 PFU of AUS2-11(gag) and the T cell response to RhCMV and
SIVgag was measured. The absence of a boost in the RhCMV-specific T cell response and the
absence of a de novo response to SIVgag indicates that both animals were protected against
AUS2-11(gag) challenge. This result indicates that pp65-deleted CMV induces longterm
protective T cell responses. At day 855, animals were challenged with US2-11 containing
RhCMV(gag). Both animals displayed a boost in the CMV-specific T cell response and
developed a de novo T cell response to SIVgag consistent with super-infection by RhCMV(gag).
This result indicates that, similar to naturally infectd animals, animals experimentally infected
with replicating recombinant CMV vaccines are not protected against super-infection with US2
11 containing viruses.
                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0048]      The invention relates to a method of a vector capable of repeatly infecting an
organism which may comprise (a) constructing a vector containing and expressing at least one
cytomegalovirus (CMV) glycoprotein, wherein the glycoprotein is US2, US3, US6 or US 11, and
(b) administering the vector repeatedly into the animal or human. Where superinfectivity is
desired, any vector, advantageously a viral vector, may express one or more of the HCMV
glycoproteins US2, US3, US6 and US1I         (or the RhCMV homologues Rh182, Rh184, Rh185,
Rh189). Viral expression vectors are well known to those skilled in the art and include, for
example,    viruses such as adenoviruses,        adeno-associated  viruses (AAV),   alphaviruses,
                                                  15

herpesviruses (including cytomegalovirus itself), retroviruses and poxviruses, including avipox
viruses, attenuated poxviruses, vaccinia viruses, and particularly, the modified vaccinia Ankara
virus (MVA; ATCC Accession No. VR-1566). Such viruses, when used as expression vectors
are innately non-pathogenic in the selected subjects such as humans or have been modified to
render them non-pathogenic in the selected subjects.          For example, replication-defective
adenoviruses and alphaviruses are well known and can be used as gene delivery vectors. Without
US2-11 all of these vectors (except for CMV which contains US2-11 naturally) elicit vector
specific immunity which prohibits their repeated use.
[0049]      In an embodiment where repeated infection of a vector is desired, any vector,
advantageously a viral vector, may express one or more of the glycoproteins US2, US3, US6 and
US 11.   In a particularly advantageous embodiment, the vector expresses glycoproteins US2,
US3, US6 and US 11.      More advantageously, the the vector contains and expresses all of the
glycoproteins within the US2 to US 11 region of CMV. In an advantageous embodiment, the one
or more of the glycoproteins US2, US3, US6 and US 11 may include, but not limited to, the
glycoproteins of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,892,564; 7,749,745; 7,364,893; 6,953,661; 6,913,751;

[0050]      In an embodiment where repeated infection of a vector is desired, any vector,
advantageously a viral vector, may express one or more of the glycoproteins RhCMV
homologues Rh182, Rh184, Rhl85, Rh189.          In a particularly advantageous embodiment, the
vector expresses glycoproteins RhCMV homologues Rhl82, Rhl84, Rhl85 and Rh189. In an
advantageous embodiment, the one or more of the glycoproteins Rhl82, Rhl84, Rhl85 and
Rh189 may include, but not limited to, the glycoproteins of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,635,485;

[0051]      The present invention also encompasses a method of determining efficacy of a CMV
vaccine. Currently, efficacy of CMV vaccines are difficult to measure because CMV easily
superinfects CMV-immune individuals. The invention may comprise (a) administering a CMV
vaccine to a test subject, (b) challenging the test subject with a CMV vector, wherein
glycoproteins within the US2 to US 11 region of CMV are deleted from the CMV vector , and
                                                16

wherein the CMV vector contains and expresses at least one immunogen of the CMV vaccine,
and (c) measuring a CD8+ T cell response, wherein the CMV vaccine is efficacious if a CD8+ T
cell response is able to prevent infection with the CMV vector lacking the glycoproteins within
the US2 to US II region of CMV and wherein the CMV vector contains and expresses at least
one immunogen of the CMV vaccine.
[0052]     Applicants have infected rhesus macaques with RhCMV lacking the gene Rh1 10 that
encodes for the viral transactivator pp7l. RhCMVARh110 is growth-deficient in vitro and is
attenuated in vitro since it is not secreted from infected monkeys (see FIG. 22).
RhCMVARhI 110 thus represents an example for an attenuated CMV vaccine. Applicants tested
whether monkeys infected with RhCMVARh110               are protected against challenge with
RhCMVAUS2-11 expressing the SIV antigen Gag as immunological marker. Protection against
infection with RhCMVAUS2-1 Iwas demonstrated by the absence of a boost in RhCMV-specific
T cell responses and absence of a SIVgag-specific immune response. In contrast, monkeys
infected with wildtype-virus typically show a boost of the CMV-specific T cell response and
develop a de novo response to SIIVgag (see FIG. 43). This result indicates that spread-deficient,
attenuated CMV is capable of inducing a T cell response that protects against challenge with
US2-11 deleted virus. This result also indicates that a US2-11 deleted virus can be used to
monitor the efficacy of the T cell response. Because of the similarities between RhCMV and
HCMV, Applicants believe that a CMV-vector lacking pp71 can be used as a vaccine against
CMV. Applicants further believe that a vaccine against HCMV can be validated by challenge
with HCMV lacking US2-11.
[0053]     In a similar experiment Applicants created a RhCMV lacking the tegument proteins
pp65a and pp65b encoded by the genes Rh 111 and RhI 12, respectively (see FIG. 24). These
proteins are not required for viral growth in vitro or in vivo since Applicants observed that
RhCMVARh1 11-112 is secreted from infected animals However, pp65 is an immunodominant
protein that is included in current formulations of subunit vaccines for CMV developed by
various investigators. To examine whether pp65-specific T cells are required for protection
against challenge with AUS2-11, Applicants infected rhesus macaques with RhCMVARhI 11
112. As expected Applicants observed an immune response against the IE-proteins of CMV , but
not against pp65. In contrast, a pp65-specific T cell response was readily detected in animals
infected with RhCMV (blue line).           Applicants tested whether monkeys infected with
                                                 17

RhCMVARh1 11-2 are protected against challenge with RhCMVAUS2-11 expressing the SIV
antigen Gag as immunological marker. Protection against infection with RhCMVAUS2-1Iwas
demonstrated by the absence of a boost in RhCMV-specific T cell responses and absence of a
SIVgag-specific immune response (see Fig. 25). In contrast, monkeys infected with wildtype
virus typically show a boost of the CMV-specific T cell response and develop a de novo
response to SIVgag (see FIG. 25).
[0054]     The present invention also relates to a method of inducing a different CD8+ T cell
response in an animal, which may comprise (a) administering a CMV vector with at least one
cytomegalovirus (CMV) glycoprotein deleted from the CMV vector, wherein the glycoprotein is
US2, US3, US6 or US 11, and wherein the CMV vector contains and expresses at least one
immunogen, and (b) administering the vector to the animal or human, wherein the CD8+ T cell
response in the animal or human differs as compared to a CMV vector that contains and
expresses the same immunogen and wherein a CMV glycoprotein is not deleted from the CMV
vector.
[0055]     The present invention also relates to a method of inducing a different pathogen
specific CD8+ T cell response in an animal, which may comprise (a) administering a CMV
vector with at least one cytomegalovirus (CMV) glycoprotein deleted from the CMV vector,
wherein the glycoprotein is US2, US3, US6 or US 11, and wherein the CMV vector contains and
expresses at least one pathogen-derived immunogen, and (b) administering the vector to the
animal, wherein the CD8+ T cell response in the animal differs as compared to a CMV vaccine
with a CMV vector that contains and expresses the same immunogen and wherein a CMV
glycoprotein is not deleted from the CMV vector.
[0056]     Advantageously, the animal is a human.
[0057]     The pathogen may be a viral pathogen and the immunogen may be a protein derived
from the viral pathogen. Viruses include, but are not limited to Adenovirus, coxsackievirus,

[0061]      Applicants demonstrate that US2-11          deleted vector can induce a qualitatively
different immune response to a heterologous antigen as compared to a recombinant wildtype
virus (see FIGS. 19 and 20). Applicants inoculate animals carrying different US2-11 deleted
vectors expressing antigens from SIV and examining T cell responses SIV antigens such as gag,
retanef, env and pol, which are used to vaccinate CMV-naive rhesus macaques (RMs) against
SIV. The T cell response is determined as indicated below.
[0062]      It is an object of the invention to provide a recombinant cytomegalovirus (CMV).
[0063]      It is a further object of the invention to provide such a recombinant which contains
exogenous DNA, preferably in a non-essential region, and which has had one or more
glycoproteins US2, US3, US6 and US 11, deleted therefrom.
[0064]      It is also an object of the invention to provide such a recombinant CMVcontaining
exogenous DNA.
[0065]      Further objects of the invention include any or all of: to provide expression products
from such recombinants, methods for expressing products from such recombinants, compositions
containing the recombinants or the expression products, methods for using the expression
products, methods for using the compositions, DNA from the recombinants, and methods for
replicating DNA from the recombinants.
[0066]      Accordingly, the invention provides a CMV synthetically modified to contain therein
exogenous DNA. The CMV advantageously has had one or more glycoproteins US2, US3, US6
and US 11, deleted therefrom.
[0067]      The invention also pertains to any viral vector that contains and expresses one or
more CMV glycoproteins US2, US3, US6 and US 11.
                                                   22

[0068]       The invention further provides a vector for cloning or expression of heterologous
DNA comprising the recombinant CMV.
[0069]       The heterologous DNA encodes an expression product comprising: an epitope of
interest, a biological response modulator, a growth factor, a recognition sequence, a therapeutic
gene, or a fusion protein.
[0070]       An epitope of interest is an antigen or immunogen or immunologically active
fragment thereof from a pathogen or toxin of veterinary or human interest.
[0071]       An epitope of interest can be an antigen of pathogen or toxin, or from an antigen of a
pathogen or toxin, or another antigen or toxin which elicits a response with respect to the
pathogen, of from another antigen or toxin which elicits a response with respect to the pathogen.
[0072]       An epitope of interest can be an antigen of a human pathogen or toxin, or from an
antigen of a human pathogen or toxin, or another antigen or toxin which elicits a response with
respect to the pathogen, or from another antigen or toxin which elicits a response with respect to
the pathogen, such as, for instance: a Morbillivirus antigen, e.g., a measles virus antigen such as
HA or F; a rabies glycoprotein, e.g., rabies virus glycoprotein G; an influenza antigen, e.g.,
influenza virus HA or N; a Herpesvirus antigen, e.g., a glycoprotein of a herpes simplex virus
(HSV), a human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-Barr; a flavivirus antigen, a JEV, Yellow
Fever    virus or    Dengue virus     antigen;    a   Hepatitis   virus antigen,  e.g., HBsAg;     an
immunodeficiency virus antigen, e.g., an HIV antigen such as gp120, gp160; a Hantaan virus
antigen; a C. tetani antigen; a mumps antigen; a pneumococcal antigen, e.g., PspA; a Borrelia
antigen, e.g., OspA, OspB, OspC of Borrelia associated with Lyme disease such as Borrelia
burgdoreferi, Borrelia atzelli and Borrelia garinii; a chicken pox (varicella zoster) antigen; or a
Plasmodium antigen.
[0073]       Advantageously,    the   epitope    of interest    is   an immunodeficiency     antigen,
advantageously HIV or SIV.
[0074]       Of course, the foregoing lists are intended as exemplary, as the epitope of interest can
be an antigen of any veterinary or human pathogen or from any antigen of any veterinary or
human pathogen.
[0075]       Since the heterologous DNA can be a growth factor or therapeutic gene, the
recombinant CMV can be used in gene therapy. Gene therapy involves transferring genetic
information; and, with respect to gene therapy and immunotherapy, reference is made to U.S.
                                                   23

Pat. No. 5,252,479, which is incorporated herein by reference, together with the documents cited
in it and on its face, and to WO 94/16716 and U.S. application Ser. No. 08/184,009, filed January
19, 1994, each of which is also incorporated herein by reference, together with the documents
cited therein. The growth factor or therapeutic gene, for example, can encode a disease-fighting
protein, a molecule for treating cancer, a tumor suppressor, a cytokine, a tumor associated
antigen, or interferon; and, the growth factor or therapeutic gene can, for example, be selected
from the group consisting of a gene encoding alpha-globin, beta-globin, gamma-globin,
granulocyte macrophage-colony       stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor, an interleukin,
macrophage colony stimulating factor, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, erythropoietin,
mast cell growth factor, tumor suppressor p53, retinoblastoma, interferon, melanoma associated
antigen or B7.
[0076]      The invention still further provides an immunogenic, immunological or vaccine
composition containing the recombinant CMVvirus or vector, and a pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier or diluent. An immunological composition containing the recombinant CMV virus or
vector (or an expression product thereof) elicits an immunological response--local or systemic.
The response can, but need not be, protective. An immunogenic composition containing the
recombinant CMVvirus or vector (or an expression product thereof) likewise elicits a local or
systemic immunological response which can, but need not be, protective. A vaccine composition
elicits a local or systemic protective response. Accordingly, the terms "immunological
composition" and "immunogenic composition" include a "vaccine composition" (as the two
former terms can be protective compositions).
[0077]      The invention therefore also provides a method of inducing an immunological
response in a host vertebrate comprising administering          to the host an immunogenic,
immunological or vaccine composition comprising the recombinant CMVvirus or vector and a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. For purposes of this specification, "animal"
includes all vertebrate species, except humans; and "vertebrate" includes all vertebrates,
including animals (as "animal" is used herein) and humans. And, of course, a subset of "animal"
is "mammal", which for purposes of this specification includes all mammals, except humans.
[0078]      The invention even further provides a therapeutic composition containing the
recombinant CMVvirus or vector and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The
therapeutic composition is useful in the gene therapy and immunotherapy embodiments of the
                                                24

invention, e.g., in a method for transferring genetic information to an animal or human in need of
such comprising administering to the host the composition; and, the invention accordingly
includes methods for transferring genetic information.
[0079]      In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a method of expressing a protein
or gene product or an expression product which comprises infecting or transfecting a cell in vitro
with a recombinant CMVvirus or vector of the invention and optionally extracting, purifying or
isolating the protein, gene product or expression product or DNA from the cell. And, the
invention provides a method for cloning or replicating a heterologous DNA sequence comprising
infecting or transfecting a cell in vitro or in vivo with a recombinant CMV virus or vector of the
invention and optionallly extracting, purifying or isolating the DNA from the cell or progeny
virus
[0080]      The invention in another aspect provides a method for preparing the recombinant
CMV virus or vector of the invention comprising inserting the exogenous DNA into a non
essential region of the CMVgenome.
[0081]      The method can further comprise deleting a non-essential region from the
CMVgenome, preferably prior to inserting the exogenous DNA.
[0082]      The method can comprise in vivo recombination. Thus, the method can comprise
transfecting a cell with CMV DNA in a cell-compatible medium in the presence of donor DNA
comprising the exogenous DNA flanked by DNA sequences homologous with portions of the
CMV genome, whereby the exogenous DNA is introduced into the genome of the CMV, and
optionally then recovering CMV modified by the in vivo recombination.
[0083]      The method can also comprise cleaving CMV DNA to obtain cleaved CMV DNA,
ligating the exogenous DNA to the cleaved CMV DNA to obtain hybrid CMV-exogenous DNA,
tranfecting a cell with the hybrid CMV-exogenous DNA, and optionally then recovering
CMVmodified by the presence of the exogenous DNA.
[0084]      Since in vivo recombination is comprehended, the invention accordingly also
provides a plasmid comprising donor DNA not naturally occurring in CMVencoding a
polypeptide foreign to CMV, the donor DNA is within a segment of CMV DNA which would
otherwise be co-linear with a non-essential region of the CMVgenome such that DNA from a
non-essential region of CMVis flanking the donor DNA.
                                                   25

[0085]       The exogenous DNA can be inserted into CMV to generate the recombinant CMV in
any orientation which yields stable integration of that DNA, and expression thereof, when
desired.
[0086]       The exogenous DNA in the recombinant CMVvirus or vector of the invention can
include a promoter. The promoter can be from a herpesvirus. For instance, the promoter can be a
cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, such as a human CMV (HCMV) or murine CMVpromoter.
[0087]       The promoter may be a truncated transcriptionally active promoter which comprises a
region transactivated with a transactivating protein provided by the virus and the minimal
promoter region of the full-length promoter from which the truncated transcriptionally active
promoter is derived. For purposes of this specification, a "promoter" is composed of an
association of DNA sequences corresponding to the minimal promoter and upstream regulatory
sequences; a "minimal promoter" is composed of the CAP site plus TATA box (minimum
sequences for basic level of transcription; unregulated level of transcription); and, "upstream
regulatory sequences" are composed of the upstream element(s) and enhancer sequence(s).
Further, the term "truncated" indicates that the full-length promoter is not completely present,
i.e., that some portion of the full-length promoter has been removed. And, the truncated promoter
can be derived from a herpesvirus such as MCMVor HCMV, e.g., HCMV-IE or MCMV-IE.
[0088]       Like the aforementioned promoter, the inventive promoter is preferably a herpesvirus,
e.g., a MCMVor HCMVsuch as MCMV-IE or HCMV-IE promoter; and, there can be up to a
40% and even up to a 90% reduction in size, from a full-length promoter, based upon base pairs.
[0089]       The invention thus also provides an expression cassette for insertion into a
recombinant virus or plasmid comprising the truncated transcriptionally active promoter. The
expression cassette can further include a functional truncated polyadenylation signal; for instance
an SV40 polyadenylation signal which is truncated, yet functional. Considering that nature
provided a larger signal, it is indeed surprising that a truncated polyadenylation signal is
functional; and, a truncated polyadenylation signal addresses the insert size limit problems of
recombinant viruses such as CMV. The expression cassette can also include exogenous or
heterologous DNA with respect to the virus or system into which it is inserted; and that DNA can
be exogenous or heterologous DNA as described herein.
[0090]       In a more specific aspect, the present invention encompasses CMV, recombinants
comprising the HCMV-IE or MCMV-IE promoter, preferably a truncated promoter therefrom.
                                                 26

Preferably, the HCMV-IE or MCMV-IE promoter or a truncated promoter therefrom is
transactivated by CMV-induced gene products.
[0091]       The invention further comprehends antibodies elicited by the inventive compositions
and/or recombinants and uses for such antibodies. The antibodies, or the product (epitopes of
interest) which elicited them, or monoclonal antibodies from the antibodies, can be used in
binding assays, tests or kits to determine the presence or absence of an antigen or antibody.
[0092]       Flanking DNA used in the invention can be from the site of insertion or a portion of
the genome adjacent thereto (wherein "adjacent" includes contiguous sequences, e.g., codon or
codons, as well as up to as many sequences, e.g., codon or codons, before there is an intervening
insertion site).
[0093]       The exogenous or heterologous DNA (or DNA foreign to CMV, or DNA not
naturally occurring in CMV) can be DNA encoding any of the aforementioned epitopes of
interest, as listed above. The exogenous DNA can include a marker, e.g., a color or light marker.
The exogenous DNA can also code for a product which would be detrimental to an insect host
such that the expression product can be a pesticide or insecticide. The exogenous DNA can also
code for an anti-fungal polypeptide; and, for information on such a polypeptide and DNA
therefor, reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,421,839 and the documents cited therein,
incorporated herein by reference.
[0094]       The heterologous or exogenous DNA in recombinants of the invention preferably
encodes an expression product comprising: an epitope of interest, a biological response
modulator, a growth factor, a recognition sequence, a therapeutic gene, or a fusion protein. With
respect to these terms, reference is made to the following discussion, and generally to Kendrew,
THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (Blackwell Science Ltd 1995) and
Sambrook, Fritsch, Maniatis, Molecular Cloning, A LABORATORY MANUAL (2d Edition,
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989).
[0095]       As to antigens for use in vaccine or immunological compositions, see also Stedman's
Medical Dictionary (24th edition, 1982, e.g., definition of vaccine (for a list of antigens used in
vaccine formulations; such antigens or epitopes of interest from those antigens can be used in the
invention, as either an expression product of the inventive recombinant virus, or in a multivalent
composition containing an inventive recombinant virus or an expression product therefrom).
                                                  27

[0096]       As to epitopes of interest, one skilled in the art can determine an epitope or
immunodominant region of a peptide or polypeptide and ergo the coding DNA therefor from the
knowledge of the amino acid and corresponding DNA sequences of the peptide or polypeptide,
as well as from the nature of particular amino acids (e.g., size, charge, etc.) and the codon
dictionary, without undue experimentation.
[0097]       A general method for determining which portions of a protein to use in an
immunological composition focuses on the size and sequence of the antigen of interest. "In
general, large proteins, because they have more potential determinants are better antigens than
small ones. The more foreign an antigen, that is the less similar to self configurations which
induce tolerance, the more effective it is in provoking an immune response." Ivan Roitt, Essential
Immunology, 1988.
[0098]       As to size: the skilled artisan can maximize the size of the protein encoded by the
DNA sequence to be inserted into the viral vector (keeping in mind the packaging limitations of
the vector). To minimize the DNA inserted while maximizing the size of the protein expressed,
the DNA sequence can exclude introns (regions of a gene which are transcribed but which are
subsequently excised from the primary RNA transcript).
[0099]       At a minimum, the DNA sequence can code for a peptide at least 8 or 9 amino acids
long. This is the minimum length that a peptide needs to be in order to stimulate a CD4+ T cell
response (which recognizes virus infected cells or cancerous cells). A minimum peptide length of
13 to 25 amino acids is useful to stimulate a CD8+ T cell response (which recognizes special
antigen presenting cells which have engulfed the pathogen). See Kendrew, supra. However, as
these are minimum lengths, these peptides are likely to generate an immunological response, i.e.,
an antibody or T cell response; but, for a protective response (as from a vaccine composition), a
longer peptide is preferred.
[00100]      With respect to the sequence, the DNA sequence preferably encodes at least regions
of the peptide that generate an antibody response or a T cell response. One method to determine
T and B cell epitopes involves epitope mapping. The protein of interest "is fragmented into
overlapping peptides with proteolytic enzymes. The individual peptides are then tested for their
ability to bind to an antibody elicited by the native protein or to induce T cell or B cell activation.
This approach has been particularly useful in mapping T-cell epitopes since the T cell recognizes
short linear peptides complexed with MHC molecules (see FIG. 20). The method is less effective
                                                  28

for determining B-cell epitopes" since B cell epitopes are often not linear amino acid sequence
but rather result from the tertiary structure of the folded three dimensional protein. Janis Kuby,
Immunology, (1992) pp. 79-80.
[00101]     Another method for determining an epitope of interest is to choose the regions of the
protein that are hydrophilic. Hydrophilic residues are often on the surface of the protein and are
therefore often the regions of the protein which are accessible to the antibody. Janis Kuby,
Immunology, (1992) p. 81.
[00102]     Yet another method for determining an epitope of interest is to perform an X-ray
crystallographic    analysis  of the    antigen (full   length)-antibody  complex.   Janis   Kuby,
Immunology, (1992) p. 80.
[00103]     Still another method for choosing an epitope of interest which can generate a T cell
response is to identify from the protein sequence potential HLA anchor binding motifs which are
peptide sequences which are known to be likely to bind to the MHC molecule.
[00104]     The peptide which is a putative epitope of interest, to generate a T cell response,
should be presented in a MHC complex. The peptide preferably contains appropriate anchor
motifs for binding to the MHC molecules, and should bind with high enough affinity to generate
an immune response. Factors which can be considered are: the HLA type of the patient
(vertebrate, animal or human) expected to be immunized, the sequence of the protein, the
presence of appropriate anchor motifs and the occurance of the peptide sequence in other vital
cells.
[00105]     An immune response is generated, in general, as follows: T cells recognize proteins
only when the protein has been cleaved into smaller peptides and is presented in a complex
called the "major histocompatability complex MHC" located on another cell's surface. There are
two classes of MHC complexes--class I and class II, and each class is made up of many different
alleles. Different patients have different types of MHC complex alleles; they are said to have a
'different HLA type.
[00106]     Class I MHC complexes are found on virtually every cell and present peptides from
proteins produced inside the cell. Thus, Class I MHC complexes are useful for killing cells
which when infected by viruses or which have become cancerous and as the result of expression
of an oncogene. T cells which have a protein called CD8 on their surface, bind to the MHC class
                                                  29

I cells and secrete lymphokines. The lymphokines stimulate a response; cells arrive and kill the
viral infected cell.
[00107]      Class II MHC complexes are found only on antigen-presenting cells and are used to
present peptides from circulating pathogens which have been endocytosed by the antigen
presenting cells. T cells which have a protein called CD4 bind to the MHC class II cells and kill
the cell by exocytosis of lytic granules.
[00108]      Some guidelines in determining whether a protein is an epitopes of interest which will
stimulate a T cell response, include: Peptide length--the peptide should be at least 8 or 9 ammino
acids long to fit into the MHC class I complex and at least 13-25 amino acids long to fit into a
class II MCH complex. This length is a minimum for the peptide to bind to the MHC complex. It
is preferred for the peptides to be longer than these lengths because cells may cut the expressed
peptides. The peptide should contain an appropriate anchor motif which will enable it to bind to
the various class I or class II molecules with high enough specificity to generate an immune
response (See Bocchia, M. et al, Specific Binding of Leukemia Oncogene Fusion Protein
Peptides to HLA Class I Molecules, Blood 85:2680-2684; Englehard, V H, Structure of peptides
associated with class I and class II MHC molecules Ann. Rev. Immunol. 12:181 (1994)). This
can be done, without undue experimentation, by comparing the sequence of the protein of
interest with published structures of peptides associated with the MHC molecules. Protein
epitopes recognized by T cell receptors are peptides generated by enzymatic degradation of the
protein molecule and are prestnted on the cell surface in association with class I or class II MHC
molecules.
[00109]      Further, the skilled artisan can ascertain an epitope of interest by comparing the
protein sequence with sequences listed in the protein data base. Regions of the protein which
share little or no homology are better choices for being an epitope of that protein and are
therefore useful in a vaccine or immunological composition. Regions which share great
homology with widely found sequences present in vital cells should be avoided.
[00110]      Even further, another method is simply to generate or express portions of a protein of
interest, generate monoclonal antibodies to those portions of the protein of interest, and then
ascertain whether those antibodies inhibit growth in vitro of the pathogen from which the from
which the protein was derived. The skilled artisan can use the other guidelines set forth in this
disclosure and in the art for generating or expressing portions of a protein of interest for analysis
                                                 30

as to whether antibodies thereto inhibit growth in vitro. For example, the skilled artisan can
generate portions of a protein of interest by: selecting 8 to 9 or 13 to 25 amino acid length
portions of the protein, selecting hydrophilic regions, selecting portions shown to bind from X
ray data of the antigen (full length)-antibody complex, selecting regions which differ in sequence
from other proteins, selecting potential HLA anchor binding motifs, or any combination of these
methods or other methods known in the art.
[00111]      Epitopes recognized by antibodies are expressed on the surface of a protein. To
determine the regions of a protein most likely to stimulate an antibody response one skilled in the
art can preferably perform an epitope map, using the general methods described above, or other
mapping methods known in the art.
[00112]      As can be seen from the foregoing, without undue experimentation, from this
disclosure and the knowledge in the art, the skilled artisan can ascertain the amino acid and
corresponding DNA sequence of an epitope of interest for obtaining a T cell, B cell and/or
antibody response. In addition, reference is made to Gefter et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,019,384, issued
May 28, 1991, and the documents it cites, incorporated herein by reference (Note especially the
"Relevant Literature" section of this patent, and column 13 of this patent which discloses that: "A
large number of epitopes have been defined for a wide variety of organisms of interest. Of
particular interest are those epitopes to which neutralizing antibodies are directed.
[00113]      With respect to expression of a biological response modulator, reference is made to
Wohlstadter, "Selection Methods," WO 93/19170, published Sep. 30, 1993, and the documents
cited therein, incorporated herein by reference.
[00114]      For instance, a biological response modulator modulates biological activity; for
instance, a biological response modulator is a modulatory component such as a high molecular
weight protein associated with non-NMDA excitatory amino acid receptors and which
allosterically regulates affinity of AMPA binding (See Kendrew, supra). The recombinant of the
present invention can express such a high molecular weight protein.
[00115]      More generally, nature has provided a number of precedents of biological response
modulators. Modulation of activity may be carried out through mechanisms as complicated and
intricate   as   allosteric  induced    quaternary    change  to  simple    presence/absence,   e.g.,
expression/degradation, systems. Indeed, the repression/activation of expression of many
                                                   31

biological molecules is itself mediated by molecules whose activities are capable of being
modulated through a variety of mechanisms.
[00116]     Table 2 of Neidhardt et al Physiology of the Bacterial Cell (Sinauer Associates Inc.,
Publishers, 1990), at page 73, lists chemical modifications to bacterial proteins. As is noted in
that table, some modifications are involved in proper assembly and other modifications are not,
but in either case such modifications are capable of causing modulation of function. From that
table, analogous chemical modulations for proteins of other cells can be determined, without
undue experimentation.
[00117]     In some instances modulation of biological functions may be mediated simply
through the proper/improper localization of a molecule. Molecules may function to provide a
growth advantage or disadvantage only if they are targeted to a particular location. For example,
a molecule may be typically not taken up or used by a cell, as a function of that molecule being
first degredaded by the cell by secretion of an enzyme for that degradation. Thus, production of
the enzyme by a recombinant can regulate use or uptake of the molecule by a cell. Likewise, the
recombinant can express a molecule which binds to the enzyme necessary for uptake or use of a
molecule, thereby similarly regulating its uptake or use.
[00118]     Localization targeting of proteins carried out through cleavage of signal peptides
another type of modulation or regulation. In this case, a specific endoprotease catalytic activity
can be expressed by the recombinant.
[00119]     Other examples of mechanisms through which modulation of function may occur are
RNA virus poly-proteins, allosteric effects, and general covalent and non-covalent steric
hindrance. HIV is a well studied example of an RNA virus which expresses non-functional poly
protein constructs. In HIV "the gag, pol, and env poly-proteins are processed to yield,
respectively, the viral structural proteins p17, p24, and p15--reverse transcriptase and integrase-
and the two envelope proteins gp4l and gp120" (Kohl et al., PNAS USA 85:4686-90 (1988)).
The proper cleavage of the poly-proteins is crucial for replication of the virus, and virions
carrying inactive mutant HIV protease are non-infectious. This is another example of the fusion
of proteins down-modulating their activity. Thus, it is possible to construct recombinant viruses
which express molecules which interfere with endoproteases, or which provide endoproteases,
for inhibiting or enhancing the natural expression of certain proteins (by interfering with or
enhancing cleavage).
                                                  32

[00120]     The functional usefulness of enzymes may also be modulated by altering their
capability of catalyzing a reaction. Illustrative examples of modulated molecules are zymogens,
formation/disassociation of multi-subunit functional complexes, RNA virus poly-protein chains,
allosteric interactions, general steric hindrance (covalent and non-covalent) and a variety of
chemical modifications such as phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, adenylation, and
uridenylation (see Table 1 of Neidhardt, supra, at page 315 and Table 2 at page 73).
[00121]     Zymogens      are examples of naturally occurring protein fusions which cause
modulation of enzymatic activity. Zymogens are one class of proteins which are converted into
their active state through limited proteolysis. See Table 3 of Reich, Proteases and Biological
Control, Vol. 2, (1975) at page 54). Nature has developed a mechanism of down-modulating the
activity of certain enzymes, such as trypsin, by expressing these enzymes with additional
"leader" peptide sequences at their amino termini. With the extra peptide sequence the enzyme is
in the inactive zymogen state. Upon cleavage of this sequence the zymogen is converted to its
enzymatically active state. The overall reaction rates of the zymogen are "about 1O.sup.5
1O.sup.6 times lower than those of the corresponding enzyme" (See Table 3 of Reich, supra at
page 54).
[00122]     It is therefore possible to down-modulate the function of certain enzymes simply by
the addition of a peptide sequence to one of its termini. For example, with knowledge of this
property, a recombinant can express peptide sequences containing additional amino acids at one
or both terminii.
[00123]     The formation or disassociation of multi-subunit enzymes is another way through
which modulation may occur. Different mechanisms may be responsible for the modulation of
activity upon formation or disassociation of multi-subunit enzymes.
[00124]     Therefore, sterically hindering the proper specific subunit interactions will down
modulate the catalytic activity. And accordingly, the recombinant of the invention can express a
molecule which sterically hinders a naturally occurring enzyme or enzyme complex, so as to
modulate biological functions.
[00125]     Certain enzyme inhibitors afford good examples of functional down-modulation
through covalent steric hindrance or modification. Suicide substrates which irreversibly bind to
the active site of an enzyme at a catalytically important amino acid in the active site are
examples of covalent modifications which sterically block the enzymatic active site. An example
                                                  33

of a suicide substrate is TPCK for chymotrypsin (Fritsch, Enzyme Structure and Mechanism, 2d
ed; Freeman & Co. Publishers, 1984)). This type of modulation is possible by the recombinant
expressing a suitable suicide substrate, to thereby modulate biological responses (e.g., by
limiting enzyme activity).
[00126]     There are also examples of non-covalent steric hindrance including many repressor
molecules. The recombinant can express repressor molecules which are capable of sterically
hindering and thus down-modulating the function of a DNA sequence by preventing particular
DNA-RNA polymerase interactions.
[00127]     Allosteric effects are another way through which modulation is carried out in some
biological systems. Aspartate transcarbamoylase is a well characterized allosteric enzyme.
Interacting with the catalytic subunits are regulatory domains. Upon binding to CTP or UTP the
regulatory subunits are capable of inducing a quaternary structural change in the holoenzyme
causing down-modulation of catalytic activity. In contrast, binding of ATP to the regulatory
subunits is capable of causing up-modulation of catalytic activity (Fritsch, supra). Using methods
of the invention, molecules can be expressed which are capable of binding and causing
modulatory quaternary or tertiary changes.
[00128]     In addition, a variety of chemical modifications, e.g., phosphorylation, methylation,
acetylation, adenylation, and uridenylation may be carried out so as to modulate function. It is
known that modifications such as these play important roles in the regulation of many important
cellular components. Table 2 of Neidhardt, supra, at page 73, lists different bacterial enzymes
which undergo such modifications. From that list, one skilled in the art can ascertain other
enzymes of other systems which undergo the same or similar modifications, without undue
experimentation. In addition, many proteins which are implicated in human disease also undergo
such chemical modifications. For example, many oncogenes have been found to be modified by
phosphorylation or to modify other proteins through phosphorylation or dephosphorylation.
Therefore, the ability afforded by the invention to express modulators which can modify or alter
function, e.g., phosphorylation, is of importance.
[00129]     From the foregoing, the skilled artisan can use the present invention to express a
biological response modulator, without any undue experimentation.
[00130]     With respect to expression of fusion proteins by inventive recombinants, reference is
made to Sambrook, Fritsch, Maniatis, Molecular Cloning, A LABORATORY MANUAL (2d
                                                 34

Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989) (especially Volume 3), and Kendrew,
supra, incorporated herein by reference. The teachings of Sambrook et al., can be suitably
modified, without undue experiementation, from this disclosure, for the skilled artisan to
generate recombinants expressing fusion proteins.
[00131]    With regard to gene therapy and immunotherapy, reference is made to U.S. Pat. Nos.
4,690,915 and 5,252,479, which are incorporated herein by reference, together with the
documents cited therein it and on their face, and to WO 94/16716 and U.S. application Ser. No.
08/184,009, filed Jan. 19, 1994, each of which is also incorporated herein by reference, together
with the documents cited therein.
[00132]    A growth factor can be defined as multifunctional, locally acting intercellular
signalling peptides which control both ontogeny and maintenance of tissue and function (see
Kendrew, especially at page 455 et seq.).
[00133]    The growth factor or therapeutic gene, for example, can encode a disease-fighting
protein, a molecule for treating cancer, a tumor suppressor, a cytokine, a tumor associated
antigen, or interferon; and, the growth factor or therapeutic gene can, for example, be selected
from the group consisting of a gene encoding alpha-globin, beta-globin, gamma-globin,
granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor, an interleukin (e.g., an
interleukin selected from interleukins 1 to 14, or 1 to 11, or any combination thereof),
macrophage colony stimulating factor, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, erythropoietin,
mast cell growth factor, tumor suppressor p53, retinoblastoma, interferon, melanoma associated
antigen or B7. U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,479 provides a list of proteins which can be expressed in an
adenovirus system for gene therapy, and the skilled artisan is directed to that disclosure. WO
94/16716 and U.S. application Ser. No. 08/184,009, filed Jan. 19, 1994, provide genes for
cytokines and tumor associated antigens and immunotherapy methods, including ex vivo
methods, and the skilled artisan is directed to those disclosures.
[00134]    Thus, one skilled in the art can create recombinants expressing a growth factor or
therapeutic gene and use the recombinants, from this disclosure and the knowledge in the art,
without undue experimentation.
[00135]    Moreover,     from the     foregoing    and the   knowledge  in  the  art,  no undue
experimentation is required for the skilled artisan to construct an inventive recombinant which
expresses an epitope of interest, a biological response modulator, a growth factor, a recognition
                                                  35

sequence, a therapeutic gene, or a fusion protein; or for the skilled artisan to use such a
recombinant.
[00136]      It is noted that the exogenous or heterologous DNA can itself include a promoter for
driving expression in the recombinant CMV, or the exogenous DNA can simply be coding DNA
and appropriately placed downstream from an endogenous promoter to drive expression. Further,
multiple copies of coding DNA or use of a strong or early promoter or early and late promoter,
or any combination thereof, can be done so as to amplify or increase expression. Thus, the
exogenous or heterologous DNA can be suitably positioned with respect to an endogenous
promoter like the E3 or the MLP promoters, or those promoters can be translocated to be inserted
at another location, with the exogenous or heterologous DNA. The coding DNA can be DNA
coding for more than one protein so as to have expression of more than one product from the
recombinant CMV.
[00137]      The expression products can be antigens, immunogens or epitopes of interest; and
therefore, the invention further relates to immunological, antigenic or vaccine compositions
containing the expression products. Further, since the CMVvector, in certain instances, can be
administered directly to a suitable host, the invention relates to compositions containing the
CMV vector. Additionally, since the expression product can be isolated from the CMV vector in
vitro or from cells infected or transfected by the CMVvector in vitro, the invention relates to
methods for expressing a product, e.g., comprising inserting the exogenous DNA into a CMVas a
vector, e.g., by restriction/ligation or by recombination followed by infection or transfection of
suitable cells in vitro with a recombinant CMV, and optionally extracting, purifying or isolating
the expression product from the cells. Any suitable extraction, purification or isolation
techniques can be employed.
[00138]      In particular, after infecting cells with the recombinant CMV, the protein(s) from the
expression of the exogenous DNA are collected by known techniques such as chromatography
(see Robbins, EPA 0162738A1; Panicali, EPA 0261940A2); Richardson, supra; Smith et al.,
supra; Pennock et al., supra; EP Patent Publication No. 0265785). The collected protein(s) can
then be employed in a vaccine, antigenic or immunological composition which also contains a
suitable carrier.
[00139]      Thus, the recombinant CMV can be used to prepare proteins such as antigens,
immunogens, epitopes of interest, etc. which can be further used in immunological, antigenic or
                                                   36

vaccine compositions. It is noted that a recombinant CMV expressing a product detrimental to
growth or development of insects can be used to prepare an insecticide, and a recombinant CMV
expressing a product detrimental to growth of plants can be used to prepare a herbicide (by
isolating the expression product and admixing it with an insecticidally or herbicidally acceptable
carrier or diluent) and a recombinant CMV expressing an anti-fungal polypeptide can be used to
prepare an anti-fungal preparation (by isolating the expression product and admixing it with a
suitable carrier or diluent).
[00140]     As the expression products can provide an antigenic, immunological or protective
(vaccine) response, the invention further relates to products therefrom; namely, antibodies and
uses thereof. More in particular, the expression products can elicit antibodies. The antibodies can
be formed into monoclonal antibodies; and, the antibodies or expression products can be used in
kits, assays, tests, and the like involving binding, so that the invention relates to these uses too.
Additionally, since the recombinants of the invention can be used to replicate DNA, the
invention relates to recombinant CMVas a vector and methods for replicating DNA by infecting
or transfecting cells with the recombinant and harvesting DNA therefrom. The resultant DNA
can be used as probes or primers or for amplification.
[00141]     The administration procedure for recombinant CMVor expression product thereof,
compositions of the invention such as immunological, antigenic or vaccine compositions or
therapeutic compositions can be via a parenteral route (intradermal, intramuscular or
subcutaneous). Such an administration enables a systemic immune response. The administration
can be via a mucosal route, e.g., oral, nasal, genital, etc. Such an administration enables a local
immune response.
[00142]     More generally, the inventive antigenic, immunological or vaccine compositions or
therapeutic compositions (compositions containing the CMV recombinants of the invention or
expression products) can be prepared in accordance with standard techniques well known to
those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts. Such compositions can be administered in dosages and
by techniques well known to those skilled in the medical arts taking into consideration such
factors as the breed or species, age, sex, weight, and condition of the particular patient, and the
route of administration. The compositions can be administered alone, or can be co-administered
or sequentially administered with other compositions of the invention or with other
immunological, antigenic or vaccine or therapeutic compositions. Such other compositions can
                                                  37

include purified native antigens or epitopes or antigens or epitopes from the expression by a
recombinant CMV or another vector system; and are administered taking into account the
aforementioned factors.
[00143]      Examples of compositions of the invention include liquid preparations for orifice,
e.g., oral, nasal, anal, genital, e.g., vaginal, etc., administration such as suspensions, syrups or
elixirs; and, preparations for parenteral, subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular or intravenous
administration (e.g., injectable administration) such as sterile suspensions or emulsions. In such
compositions the recombinant may be in admixture with a suitable carrier, diluent, or excipient
such as sterile water, physiological saline, glucose or the like.
[00144]      Antigenic, immunological or vaccine compositions typically can contain an adjuvant
and an amount of the recombinant CMVor expression product to elicit the desired response. In
human applications, alum (aluminum phosphate or aluminum hydroxide) is a typical adjuvant.
Saponin and its purified component Quil A, Freund's complete adjuvant and other adjuvants used
in research and veterinary applications have toxicities which limit their potential use in human
vaccines. Chemically defined preparations such as muramyl dipeptide, monophosphoryl lipid A,
phospholipid conjugates such as those described by Goodman-Snitkoff et al. J. Immunol.
147:410-415 (1991) and incorporated by reference herein, encapsulation of the protein within a
proteoliposome as described by Miller et al., J. Exp. Med. 176:1739-1744 (1992)                   and
incorporated by reference herein, and encapsulation of the protein in lipid vesicles such as
Novasome lipid vesicles (Micro Vescular Systems, Inc., Nashua, N.H.) can also be used.
[00145]      The composition may be packaged in a single dosage form for immunization by
parenteral    (i.e., intramuscular,    intradermal    or subcutaneous)    administration   or  orifice
administration, e.g., perlingual (i.e., oral), intragastric, mucosal including intraoral, intraanal,
intravaginal, and the like administration. And again, the effective dosage and route of
administration are determined by the nature of the composition, by the nature of the expression
product, by expression level if recombinant CMV is directly used, and by known factors, such as
breed or species, age, sex, weight, condition and nature of host, as well as LD 50 and other
screening procedures which are known and do not require undue experimentation. Dosages of
expressed product can range from a few to a few hundred micrograms, e.g., 5 to 500 pg. The
inventive recombinant can be administered in any suitable amount to achieve expression at these
dosage levels. The vaccinal CMV is administered in an amount of about 10'               pfu; thus, the
                                                   38

inventive recombinant is preferably administered in at least this amount; more preferably about
104 pfu to about 106 pfu. Other suitable carriers or diluents can be water or a buffered saline,
with or without a preservative. The expression product or recombinant CMVmay be lyophilized
for resuspension at the time of administration or can be in solution.
[00146]      The carrier may also be a polymeric delayed release system. Synthetic polymers are
particularly useful in the formulation of a composition having controlled release. An early
example of this was the polymerization of methyl methacrylate into spheres having diameters
less than one micron to form so-called nano particles, reported by Kreuter, J., Microcapsules and
Nanoparticles in Medicine and Pharmacology, M. Donbrow (Ed). CRC Press, p. 125-148.
[00147]      Microencapsulation    has been applied to the injection of microencapsulated
pharmaceuticals to give a controlled release. A number of factors contribute to the selection of a
particular polymer for microencapsulation. The reproducibility of polymer synthesis and the
microencapsulation process, the cost of the microencapsulation materials and process, the
toxicological profile, the requirements for variable release kinetics and the physicochemical
compatibility of the polymer and the antigens are all factors that must be considered. Examples
of useful polymers are polycarbonates, polyesters, polyurethanes,            polyorthoesters and
polyamides, particularly those that are biodegradable.
[00148]      A frequent choice of a carrier for pharmaceuticals and more recently for antigens is
poly (d, 1-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). This is a biodegradable polyester that has a long history
of medical use in erodible sutures, bone plates and other temporary prostheses where it has not
exhibited any toxicity. A wide variety of pharmaceuticals including peptides and antigens have
been formulated into PLGA microcapsules. A body of data has accumulated on the adaption of
PLGA for the controlled release of antigen, for example, as reviewed by Eldridge, J. H., et al.
Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology. 1989, 146:59-66. The entrapment of antigens
in PLGA microspheres of 1 to 10 microns in diameter has been shown to have a remarkable
adjuvant effect when administered orally. The PLGA microencapsulation process uses a phase
separation of a water-in-oil emulsion. The compound of interest is prepared as an aqueous
solution and the PLGA is dissolved in a suitable organic solvents such as methylene chloride and
ethyl acetate. These two immiscible solutions are co-emulsified by high-speed stirring. A non
solvent for the polymer is then added, causing precipitation of the polymer around the aqueous
droplets to form embryonic microcapsules. The microcapsules are collected, and stabilized with
                                                 39

one of an assortment of agents (polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), gelatin, alginates, polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP), methyl cellulose) and the solvent removed by either drying in vacuo or solvent extraction.
[00149]      Thus, solid, including solid-containing-liquid, liquid, and gel (including "gel caps")
compositions are envisioned.
[00150]      Additionally, the inventive vectors, e.g., recombinant CMV, and the expression
products therefrom can stimulate an immune or antibody response in animals. From those
antibodies, by techniques well-known in the art, monoclonal antibodies can be prepared and,
those monoclonal antibodies, can be employed in well known antibody binding assays,
diagnostic kits or tests to determine the presence or absence of antigen(s) and therefrom the
presence or absence of the natural causative agent of the antigen or, to determine whether an
immune response to that agent or to the antigen(s) has simply been stimulated.
[00151]      Monoclonal antibodies are immunoglobulin produced by hybridoma cells. A
monoclonal antibody reacts with a single antigenic determinant and provides greater specificity
than a conventional, serum-derived antibody. Furthermore, screening a large number of
monoclonal antibodies makes it possible to select an individual antibody with desired specificity,
avidity and isotype. Hybridoma cell lines provide a constant, inexpensive source of chemically
identical antibodies and preparations of such antibodies can be easily standardized. Methods for
producing monoclonal antibodies are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, e.g.,
Koprowski, H. et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,196,265, issued Apr. 1, 1989, incorporated herein by
reference.
[00152]      Uses of monoclonal antibodies are known. One such use is in diagnostic methods,
e.g., David, G. and Greene, H., U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110, issued Mar. 8, 1983, incorporated herein
by reference.
[00153]      Monoclonal      antibodies   have    also  been     used   to   recover  materials   by
immunoadsorption chromatography, e.g. Milstein, C., 1980, Scientific American 243:66, 70,
incorporated herein by reference.
[00154]      Furthermore, the inventive recombinant CMVor expression products therefrom can
be used to stimulate a response in cells in vitro or ex vivo for subsequent reinfusion into a
patient. If the patient is seronegative, the reinfusion is to stimulate an immune response, e.g., an
immunological or antigenic response such as active immunization. In a seropositive individual,
the reinfusion is to stimulate or boost the immune system against a pathogen.
                                                   40

[00155]     The recombinant CMVof the invention are also useful for generating DNA for probes
or for PCR primers which can be used to detect the presence or absence of hybridizable DNA or
to amplify DNA, e.g., to detect a pathogen in a sample or for amplifying DNA.
[00156]     Furthermore,   as  discussed above, the invention comprehends          promoters and
expression cassettes which are useful in adenovirus systems, as well as in any viral or cell system
which provides a transactivating protein.
[00157]     The expression cassette of the invention can further include a functional truncated
polyadenylation signal; for instance an SV40 polyadenylation signal which is truncated, yet
functional. The expression cassette can contain exogenous or heterologous DNA (with respect to
the virus or system into which the promoter or expression cassette is being inserted); for instance
exogenous or heterologous coding DNA as herein described above, and in the Examples. This
DNA can be suitably positioned and operably linked to the promoter for expression. The
expression cassette can be inserted in any orientation; preferably the orientation which obtains
maximum expression from the system or virus into which the expression cassette is inserted.
[00158]     While the promoter and expression cassette are specifically exemplified with
reference to adenoviruses, the skilled artisan can adapt these embodiments of the invention to
other viruses and to plasmids for cells such as eukaryotic cells, without undue experimentation,
by simply ascertaining whether the virus, plasmid, cell or system provides the transactivating
protein.
[00159]     As to HCMV promoters, reference is made to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,168,062 and
5,385,839, incorporated herein by reference. As to transfecting cells with plasmid DNA for
expression therefrom, reference is made to Felgner et al. (1994), J. Biol. Chem. 269, 2550-2561,
incorporated herein by reference. And, as to direct injection of plasmid DNA as a simple and
effective method of vaccination against a variety of infectious diseases reference is made to
Science, 259:1745-49, 1993, incorporated herein by reference. It is therefore within the scope of
this invention that the inventive promoter and expression cassette be used in systems other than
adenovirus; for example, in plasmids for the direct injection of plasmid DNA.
[00160]     The protein fragments of the present invention form a further aspect of the invention;
and, such compounds may be used in methods of medical treatments, such as for diagnosis,
preventing or treating HIV or for eliciting antibodies for diagnosis of HIV, including use in
vaccines.   Further, such compounds may be used in the preparation of medicaments for such
                                                41

treatments or prevention, or compositions for diagnostic purposes.        The compounds may be
employed alone or in combination with other treatments, vaccines or preventatives; and, the
compounds may be used in the preparation of combination medicaments for such treatments or
prevention, or in kits containing the compound and the other treatment or preventative.
[00161]     In yet another embodiment, the present invention also encompassed the use of the
protein fragments of the present invention described herein as immunogens, advantageously as
HIV-1 vaccine components.
[00162]     The terms "protein", "peptide", "polypeptide", and "amino acid sequence" are used
interchangeably herein to refer to polymers of amino acid residues of any length. The polymer
may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids or amino acid analogs, and it
may be interrupted by chemical moieties other than amino acids. The terms also encompass an
amino acid polymer that has been modified naturally or by intervention; for example disulfide
bond    formation,     glycosylation,  lipidation,   acetylation, phosphorylation,   or  any   other
manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labeling or bioactive component.
[00163]     As used herein, the terms "antigen" or "immunogen" are used interchangeably to
refer to a substance, typically a protein, which is capable of inducing an immune response in a
subject. The term also refers to proteins that are immunologically active in the sense that once
administered to a subject (either directly or by administering to the subject a nucleotide sequence
or vector that encodes the protein) is able to evoke an immune response of the humoral and/or
cellular type directed against that protein.
[00164]     The term "antibody" includes intact molecules as well as fragments thereof, such as
Fab, F(ab') 2 , Fv and scFv which are capable of binding the epitope determinant. These antibody
fragments retain some ability to selectively bind with its antigen or receptor and include, for
example:
            a.       Fab, the fragment which contains a monovalent antigen-binding fragment of
                     an antibody molecule can be produced by digestion of whole antibody with
                     the enzyme papain to yield an intact light chain and a portion of one heavy
                     chain;
            b.       Fab', the fragment of an antibody molecule can be obtained by treating whole
                     antibody with pepsin, followed by reduction, to yield an intact light chain and
                                                   42

                    a portion of the heavy chain; two Fab' fragments are obtained per antibody
                    molecule;
            c.      F(ab') 2 , the fragment of the antibody that can be obtained by treating whole
                    antibody with the enzyme pepsin without subsequent reduction; F(ab')2 is a
                    dimer of two Fab' fragments held together by two disulfide bonds;
            d.      scFv, including a genetically engineered fragment containing the variable
                    region of a heavy and a light chain as a fused single chain molecule.
[00165]     General methods of making these fragments are known in the art. (See for example,
Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York
(1988), which is incorporated herein by reference).
[00166]     A "neutralizing antibody" may inhibit the entry of HIV-1 virus for example SF162
and/or JRCSF with a neutralization index >1.5 or >2.0. Broad and potent neutralizing antibodies
may neutralize greater than about 50% of HIV-1 viruses (from diverse clades and different
strains within a clade) in a neutralization assay. The inhibitory concentration of the monoclonal
antibody may be less than about 25 mg/ml to neutralize about 50% of the input virus in the
neutralization assay.
[00167]     It should be understood that the proteins, including the antibodies and/or antigens of
the invention may differ from the exact sequences illustrated and described herein. Thus, the
invention contemplates deletions, additions and substitutions to the sequences shown, so long as
the sequences function in accordance with the methods of the invention.              In this regard,
particularly preferred substitutions will generally be conservative in nature, i.e., those
substitutions that take place within a family of amino acids.        For example, amino acids are
generally divided into four families: (1) acidic--aspartate and glutamate; (2) basic--lysine,
arginine, histidine; (3) non-polar--alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine,
methionine, tryptophan; and (4) uncharged polar--glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, serine
threonine, tyrosine.     Phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are sometimes classified as
aromatic amino acids. It is reasonably predictable that an isolated replacement of leucine with
isoleucine or valine, or vice versa; an aspartate with a glutamate or vice versa; a threonine with a
serine or vice versa; or a similar conservative replacement of an amino acid with a structurally
related amino acid, will not have a major effect on the biological activity.        Proteins having
substantially the same amino acid sequence as the sequences illustrated and described but
                                                  43

possessing minor amino acid substitutions that do not substantially affect the immunogenicity of
the protein are, therefore, within the scope of the invention.
[00168]     As used herein the terms "nucleotide sequences" and "nucleic acid sequences" refer
to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequences, including, without
limitation, messenger RNA (mRNA), DNA/RNA hybrids, or synthetic nucleic acids.               The
nucleic acid can be single-stranded, or partially or completely double-stranded (duplex). Duplex
nucleic acids can be homoduplex or heteroduplex.
[00169]     As used herein the term "transgene" may used to refer to "recombinant" nucleotide
sequences that may be derived from any of the nucleotide sequences encoding the proteins of the
present invention.      The term "recombinant" means a nucleotide sequence that has been
manipulated "by man" and which does not occur in nature, or is linked to another nucleotide
sequence or found in a different arrangement in nature. It is understood that manipulated "by
man" means manipulated by some artificial means, including by use of machines, codon
optimization, restriction enzymes, etc.
[00170]     For example, in one embodiment the nucleotide sequences may be mutated such that
the activity of the encoded proteins in vivo is abrogated. In another embodiment the nucleotide
sequences may be codon optimized, for example the codons may be optimized for human use. In
preferred embodiments the nucleotide sequences of the invention are both mutated to abrogate
the normal in vivo function of the encoded proteins, and codon optimized for human use. For
example, each of the Gag, Pol, Env, Nef, RT, and Int sequences of the invention may be altered
in these ways.
[00171]     As regards codon optimization, the nucleic acid molecules of the invention have a
nucleotide sequence that encodes the antigens of the invention and can be designed to employ
codons that are used in the genes of the subject in which the antigen is to be produced. Many
viruses, including HIV and other lentiviruses, use a large number of rare codons and, by altering
these codons to correspond to codons commonly used in the desired subject, enhanced
expression of the antigens can be achieved.       In a preferred embodiment, the codons used are
"humanized" codons, i.e., the codons are those that appear frequently in highly expressed human
genes (Andre et al., J. Virol. 72:1497-1503, 1998) instead of those codons that are frequently
used by HIV. Such codon usage provides for efficient expression of the transgenic HIV proteins
in human cells. Any suitable method of codon optimization may be used. Such methods, and
                                                  44

the selection of such methods, are well known to those of skill in the art. In addition, there are
several companies that will optimize codons of sequences, such as Geneart (geneart.com). Thus,
the nucleotide sequences of the invention can readily be codon optimized.
[00172]     The invention further encompasses nucleotide sequences encoding functionally
and/or antigenically equivalent variants and derivatives of the antigens of the invention and
functionally equivalent fragments thereof. These functionally equivalent variants, derivatives,
and fragments display the ability to retain antigenic activity. For instance, changes in a DNA
sequence that do not change the encoded amino acid sequence, as well as those that result in
conservative substitutions of amino acid residues, one or a few amino acid deletions or additions,
and substitution of amino acid residues by amino acid analogs are those which will not
significantly affect properties of the encoded polypeptide. Conservative amino acid substitutions
are glycine/alanine; valine/isoleucine/leucine; asparagine/glutamine; aspartic acid/glutamic acid;
serine/threonine/methionine; lysine/arginine; and phenylalanine/tyrosine/tryptophan.       In one
embodiment, the variants have at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least
70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least
89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least
96%, at least 97%, at least 98% or at least 99% homology or identity to the antigen, epitope,
immunogen, peptide or polypeptide of interest.
[00173]     For the purposes of the present invention, sequence identity or homology is
determined by comparing the sequences when aligned so as to maximize overlap and identity
while minimizing sequence gaps. In particular, sequence identity may be determined using any
of a number of mathematical algorithms. A nonlimiting example of a mathematical algorithm
used for comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin & Altschul, Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA 1990; 87: 2264-2268, modified as in Karlin & Altschul, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
1993;90: 5873-5877.
[00174]     Another example of a mathematical algorithm used for comparison of sequences is
the algorithm of Myers & Miller, CABIOS 1988;4: 11-17. Such an algorithm is incorporated
into the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software
package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM120
weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used. Yet another
                                                 45

useful algorithm for identifying regions of local sequence similarity and alignment is the FASTA
algorithm as described in Pearson & Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1988; 85: 2444-2448.
[00175]      Advantageous for use according to the present invention is the WU-BLAST
(Washington University BLAST) version 2.0 software.             WU-BLAST version 2.0 executable
programs        for    several    UNIX      platforms      can     be    downloaded       from    ftp
://blast.wustl.edu/blast/executables. This program is based on WU-BLAST version 1.4, which in
turn is based on the public domain NCBI-BLAST version 1.4 (Altschul & Gish, 1996, Local
alignment statistics, Doolittle ed., Methods in Enzymology 266: 460-480; Altschul et al., Journal
of Molecular Biology 1990; 215: 403-410; Gish & States, 1993;Nature Genetics 3: 266-272;
Karlin & Altschul, 1993;Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 5873-5877; all of which are
incorporated by reference herein).
[00176]      The various recombinant nucleotide sequences and antibodies and/or antigens of the
invention are made using standard recombinant DNA and cloning techniques. Such techniques
are well known to those of skill in the art. See for example, "Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory
Manual", second edition (Sambrook et al. 1989).
[00177]      The nucleotide sequences of the present invention may be inserted into "vectors."
The term "vector" is widely used and understood by those of skill in the art, and as used herein
the term "vector" is used consistent with its meaning to those of skill in the art. For example, the
term "vector" is commonly used by those skilled in the art to refer to a vehicle that allows or
facilitates the transfer of nucleic acid molecules from one environment to another or that allows
or facilitates the manipulation of a nucleic acid molecule.
[00178]      Any vector that allows expression of the antibodies and/or antigens of the present
invention may be used in accordance with the present invention. In certain embodiments, the
antigens and/or antibodies of the present invention may be used in vitro (such as using cell-free
expression systems) and/or in cultured cells grown in vitro in order to produce the encoded HIV
antigens and/or antibodies which may then be used for various applications such as in the
production of proteinaceous vaccines. For such applications, any vector that allows expression
of the antigens and/or antibodies in vitro and/or in cultured cells may be used.
[00179]      For applications where it is desired that the antibodies and/or antigens be expressed in
vivo, for example when the transgenes of the invention are used in DNA or DNA-containing
vaccines, any vector that allows for the expression of the antibodies and/or antigens of the
                                                   46

present invention and is safe for use in vivo may be used. In preferred embodiments the vectors
used are safe for use in humans, mammals and/or laboratory animals.
[00180]      For the antibodies and/or antigens of the present invention to be expressed, the
protein coding sequence should be "operably linked" to regulatory or nucleic acid control
sequences that direct transcription and translation of the protein. As used herein, a coding
sequence and a nucleic acid control sequence or promoter are said to be "operably linked" when
they are covalently linked in such a way as to place the expression or transcription and/or
translation of the coding sequence under the influence or control of the nucleic acid control
sequence. The "nucleic acid control sequence" can be any nucleic acid element, such as, but not
limited to promoters, enhancers, IRES, introns, and other elements described herein that direct
the expression of a nucleic acid sequence or coding sequence that is operably linked thereto. The
term "promoter" will be used herein to refer to a group of transcriptional control modules that are
clustered around the initiation site for RNA polymerase II and that when operationally linked to
the protein coding sequences of the invention lead to the expression of the encoded protein. The
expression of the transgenes of the present invention can be under the control of a constitutive
promoter or of an inducible promoter, which initiates transcription only when exposed to some
particular external stimulus, such as, without limitation, antibiotics such as tetracycline,
hormones such as ecdysone, or heavy metals. The promoter can also be specific to a particular
cell-type, tissue or organ. Many suitable promoters and enhancers are known in the art, and any
such suitable promoter or enhancer may be used for expression of the transgenes of the
invention.     For example, suitable promoters and/or enhancers can be selected from the
Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPDB).
[00181]      The present invention relates to a recombinant vector expressing a foreign epitope.
Advantageously, the epitope is an HIV epitope.        In an advantageous embodiment, the HIV
epitope is a protein fragment of the present invention, however, the present invention may
encompass additional HIV antigens, epitopes or immunogens. Advantageously, the HIV epitope
is an HIV antigen, HIV epitope or an HIV immunogen, such as, but not limited to, the HIV
antigens, HIV epitopes or HIV immunogens of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,341,731; 7,335,364;

[00185]     The vectors used in accordance with the present invention should typically be chosen
such that they contain a suitable gene regulatory region, such as a promoter or enhancer, such
that the antigens and/or antibodies of the invention can be expressed.
                                                 52

[00186]      When the aim is to express the antibodies and/or antigens of the invention in vivo in a
subject, for example in order to generate an immune response against an HIV-1 antigen and/or
protective immunity against HIV-1, expression vectors that are suitable for expression on that
subject, and that are safe for use in vivo, should be chosen. For example, in some embodiments
it may be desired to express the antibodies and/or antigens of the invention in a laboratory
animal, such as for pre-clinical testing of the HIV-1 immunogenic compositions and vaccines of
the invention.    In other embodiments, it will be desirable to express the antibodies and/or
antigens of the invention in human subjects, such as in clinical trials and for actual clinical use of
the immunogenic compositions and vaccine of the invention. Any vectors that are suitable for
such uses can be employed, and it is well within the capabilities of the skilled artisan to selelct a
suitable vector. In some embodiments it may be preferred that the vectors used for these in vivo
applications are attenuated to vector from amplifying in the subject. For example, if plasmid
vectors are used, preferably they will lack an origin of replication that functions in the subject so
as to enhance safety for in vivo use in the subject.. If viral vectors are used, preferably they are
attenuated or replication-defective in the subject, again, so as to enhance safety for in vivo use in
the subject.
[00187]      In preferred embodiments of the present invention viral vectors are used.
Advantageously, the vector is a CMV vector, preferably lacking one or more of the glycoproteins
US2, US3, US6 and US11. In yet another embodiment, all of the genes between US2 and US1I
region of the CMV genome are deleted. In another embodiment, where superinfectivity or
repeated infectivity is desired, any vector, advantageously a viral vector, may express one or
more of the glycoproteins US2, US3, US6 and US 11. Viral expression vectors are well known
to those skilled in the art and include, for example, viruses such as adenoviruses, adeno
associated viruses (AAV), alphaviruses, herpesviruses, retroviruses and poxviruses, including
avipox viruses, attenuated poxviruses, vaccinia viruses, and particularly, the modified vaccinia
Ankara virus (MVA; ATCC Accession No. VR-1566). Such viruses, when used as expression
vectors are innately non-pathogenic in the selected subjects such as humans or have been
modified to render them non-pathogenic in the selected subjects.          For example, replication
defective adenoviruses and alphaviruses are well known and can be used as gene delivery
vectors. However, these vectors are immunogenic and induce immunity against the vector which
prohibits their repeated use unless they express US2-1 1.

[00188]     In an embodiment where superinfectivity or repeated infectivity is desired, any
vector, advantageously a viral vector, may express one or more of the glycoproteins US2, US3,
US6 and US 11. In a particularly advantageous embodiment, the vector expresses glycoproteins
US2, US3, US6 and US 11.         More advantageously, the the vector contains and expresses all of
the glycoproteins within the US2 to US 11 region of CMV. In an advantageous embodiment, the
one or more of the glycoproteins US2, US3, US6 and US 11 may include, but not limited to, the
glycoproteins of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,892,564; 7,749,745; 7,364,893; 6,953,661; 6,913,751;

[00189]     The nucleotide sequences and vectors of the invention can be delivered to cells, for
example if aim is to express and the HIV-1 antigens in cells in order to produce and isolate the
expressed proteins, such as from cells grown in culture. For expressing the antibodies and/or
antigens in cells any suitable transfection, transformation, or gene delivery methods can be used.
Such methods are well known by those skilled in the art, and one of skill in the art would readily
be able to select a suitable method depending on the nature of the nucleotide sequences, vectors,
and cell types used.        For example, transfection, transformation, microinjection, infection,
electroporation, lipofection, or liposome-mediated delivery could be used. Expression of the
antibodies and/or antigens can be carried out in any suitable type of host cells, such as bacterial
cells, yeast, insect cells, and mammalian cells. The antibodies and/or antigens of the invention
can also be expressed using including in vitro transcription/translation systems. All of such
methods are well known by those skilled in the art, and one of skill in the art would readily be
able to select a suitable method depending on the nature of the nucleotide sequences, vectors,
and cell types used.
[00190]     In preferred embodiments, the nucleotide sequences, antibodies and/or antigens of the
invention are administered in vivo, for example where the aim is to produce an immunogenic
response in a subject. A "subject" in the context of the present invention may be any animal.
For example, in some embodiments it may be desired to express the transgenes of the invention
in a laboratory animal, such as for pre-clinical testing of the HIV-1 immunogenic compositions
and vaccines of the invention.        In other embodiments, it will be desirable to express the
antibodies and/or antigens of the invention in human subjects, such as in clinical trials and for
                                                  54

actual clinical use of the immunogenic compositions and vaccine of the invention. In preferred
embodiments the subject is a human, for example a human that is infected with, or is at risk of
infection with, HIV- 1.
[00191]     For such in vivo applications the nucleotide sequences, antibodies and/or antigens of
the invention are preferably administered as a component of an immunogenic composition
comprising the nucleotide sequences and/or antigens of the invention in admixture with a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The immunogenic compositions of the invention are useful
to stimulate an immune response against HIV-1 and may be used as one or more components of
a prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine against HIV- 1 for the prevention, amelioration or treatment
of AIDS.    The nucleic acids and vectors of the invention are particularly useful for providing
genetic vaccines, i.e. vaccines for delivering the nucleic acids encoding the antibodies and/or
antigens of the invention to a subject, such as a human, such that the antibodies and/or antigens
are then expressed in the subject to elicit an immune response.
[00192]     The compositions of the invention may be injectable suspensions, solutions, sprays,
lyophilized powders, syrups, elixirs and the like. Any suitable form of composition may be used.
To prepare such a composition, a nucleic acid or vector of the invention, having the desired
degree of purity, is mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or
excipients.   The carriers and excipients must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible
with the other ingredients of the composition. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are
nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include, but are not
limited to, water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, or combinations
thereof, buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including
ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium
chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl
or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol;
cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues)
polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic
polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine,
histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including
glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol,
trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn
                                                 55

protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEENTM, PLURONICSTM or
polyethylene glycol (PEG).
[00193]      An immunogenic or immunological composition can also be formulated in the form
of an oil-in-water emulsion. The oil-in-water emulsion can be based, for example, on light liquid
paraffin oil (European Pharmacopea type); isoprenoid oil such as squalane, squalene,
EICOSANE       TM or tetratetracontane; oil resulting from the oligomerization of alkene(s), e.g.,
isobutene or decene; esters of acids or of alcohols containing a linear alkyl group, such as plant
oils, ethyl oleate, propylene glycol di(caprylate/caprate),            glyceryl tri(caprylate/caprate) or
propylene glycol dioleate; esters of branched fatty acids or alcohols, e.g., isostearic acid esters.
The oil advantageously is used in combination with emulsifiers to form the emulsion.                      The
emulsifiers    can be      nonionic   surfactants, such      as   esters   of sorbitan, mannide          (e.g.,
anhydromannitol     oleate),    glycerol, polyglycerol, propylene         glycol, and oleic, isostearic,
ricinoleic, or hydroxystearic acid, which are optionally ethoxylated, and polyoxypropylene
polyoxyethylene copolymer blocks, such as the Pluronic@ products, e.g., L121.                 The adjuvant
can be a mixture of emulsifier(s), micelle-forming agent, and oil such as that which is
commercially available under the name Provax@ (IDEC Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA).
[00194]      The immunogenic compositions of the invention can contain additional substances,
such as wetting or emulsifying agents, buffering agents, or adjuvants to enhance the
effectiveness of the vaccines (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,                  18th edition, Mack
Publishing Company, (ed.) 1980).
[00195]      Adjuvants may also be included. Adjuvants include, but are not limited to, mineral

[00196]      Aluminum hydroxide or phosphate (alum) are commonly used at 0.05 to 0.1%
solution in phosphate buffered saline. Other adjuvants that can be used, especially with DNA
vaccines, are cholera toxin, especially CTAl-DD/ISCOMs (see Mowat, A.M. et al (2001) J.

form of DNA, on the same expression vectors as those encoding the antigens of the invention or
on separate expression vectors.
[00197]      The immunogenic compositions can be designed to introduce the nucleic acids or
expression vectors to a desired site of action and release it at an appropriate and controllable rate.
Methods of preparing controlled-release formulations are known in the art.              For example,
controlled release preparations can be produced by the use of polymers to complex or absorb the
immunogen and/or immunogenic composition.               A controlled-release formulations can be
prepared using appropriate       macromolecules      (for example,     polyesters, polyamino    acids,
polyvinyl,    pyrrolidone,  ethylenevinylacetate,     methylcellulose,   carboxymethylcellulose,    or
protamine sulfate) known to provide the desired controlled release characteristics or release
profile.   Another possible method to control the duration of action by a controlled-release
preparation is to incorporate the active ingredients into particles of a polymeric material such as,
for example, polyesters, polyamino acids, hydrogels, polylactic             acid, polyglycolic acid,
copolymers of these acids, or ethylene vinylacetate copolymers.             Alternatively, instead of
                                                  57

incorporating these active ingredients into polymeric particles, it is possible to entrap these
materials into microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial
polymerization,     for example,    hydroxymethylcellulose   or gelatin-microcapsule  and poly
(methylmethacrylate)     microcapsule, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for
example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules)
or in macroemulsions.       Such techniques are disclosed in New Trends and Developments in
Vaccines, Voller et al. (eds.), University Park Press, Baltimore, Md., 1978 and Remington's
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th edition.
[00198]     Suitable dosages of the nucleic acids and expression vectors of the invention
(collectively, the immunogens) in the immunogenic composition of the invention can be readily
determined by those of skill in the art. For example, the dosage of the immunogens can vary
depending on the route of administration and the size of the subject.      Suitable doses can be
determined by those of skill in the art, for example by measuring the immune response of a
subject, such as a laboratry animal, using conventional immunological techniques, and adjusting
the dosages as appropriate. Such techniques for measuring the immune response of the subject
include but are not limited to, chromium release assays, tetramer binding assays, IFN-y
ELISPOT assays, IL-2 ELISPOT assays, intracellular cytokine assays, and other immunological
detection assays, e.g., as detailed in the text "Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual" by Ed Harlow
and David Lane.
[00199]     When provided prophylactically, the immunogenic compositions of the invention are
ideally administered to a subject in advance of HIV infection, or evidence of HIV infection, or in
advance of any symptom due to AIDS, especially in high-risk subjects.           The prophylactic
administration of the immunogenic compositions can serve to provide protective immunity of a
subject against HIV-1 infection or to prevent or attenuate the progression of AIDS in a subject
already infected with HIV-1.       When provided therapeutically, the immunogenic compositions
can serve to ameliorate and treat AIDS symptoms and are advantageously used as soon after
infection as possible, preferably before appearance of any symptoms of AIDS but may also be
used at (or after) the onset of the disease symptoms.
[00200]     The immunogenic compositions can be administered using any suitable delivery
method including, but not limited to, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, mucosal, and
topical delivery.    Such techniques are well known to those of skill in the art. More specific
                                                  58

examples     of delivery methods are intramuscular injection, intradermal injection, and
subcutaneous injection. However, delivery need not be limited to injection methods. Further,
delivery of DNA to animal tissue has been achieved by cationic liposomes (Watanabe et al.,
(1994) Mol. Reprod. Dev. 38:268-274; and WO 96/20013), direct injection of naked DNA into
animal muscle tissue (Robinson et al., (1993) Vaccine 11:957-960; Hoffman et al., (1994)
Vaccine 12: 1529-1533; Xiang et al., (1994) Virology 199: 132-140; Webster et al., (1994)
Vaccine 12: 1495-1498; Davis et al., (1994) Vaccine 12: 1503-1509; and Davis et al., (1993)
Hum. Mol. Gen. 2: 1847-1851), or intradermal injection of DNA using "gene gun" technology
(Johnston et al., (1994) Meth. Cell Biol. 43:353-365). Alternatively, delivery routes can be oral,
intranasal or by any other suitable route. Delivery also be accomplished via a mucosal surface
such as the anal, vaginal or oral mucosa.
[00201]     Immunization schedules (or regimens) are well known for animals (including
humans) and can be readily determined for the particular subject and immunogenic composition.
Hence, the immunogens can be administered one or more times to the subject. Preferably, there
is a set time interval between separate administrations of the immunogenic composition. While
this interval varies for every subject, typically it ranges from 10 days to several weeks, and is
often 2, 4, 6 or 8 weeks.      For humans, the interval is typically from 2 to 6 weeks.      In a
particularly advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the interval is longer,
advantageously about 10 weeks, 12 weeks, 14 weeks, 16 weeks, 18 weeks, 20 weeks, 22 weeks,
24 weeks, 26 weeks, 28 weeks, 30 weeks, 32 weeks, 34 weeks, 36 weeks, 38 weeks, 40 weeks,
42 weeks, 44 weeks, 46 weeks, 48 weeks, 50 weeks, 52 weeks, 54 weeks, 56 weeks, 58 weeks,
60 weeks, 62 weeks, 64 weeks, 66 weeks, 68 weeks or 70 weeks. In a most advantageous
embodiment, the interval is about 16 weeks or about 53 weeks.
[00202]     The immunization regimes typically have from 1 to 6 administrations of the
immunogenic composition, but may have as few as one or two or four. The methods of inducing
an immune response can also include administration of an adjuvant with the immunogens. In
some instances, annual, biannual or other long interval (5-10 years) booster immunization can
supplement the initial immunization protocol.
[00203]     The present methods also include a variety of prime-boost regimens, for example
DNA prime-Adenovirus boost regimens. In these methods, one or more priming immunizations
are followed by one or more boosting immunizations. The actual immunogenic composition can
                                                 59

be the same or different for each immunization and the type of immunogenic composition (e.g.,
containing protein or expression vector), the route, and formulation of the immunogens can also
be varied. For example, if an expression vector is used for the priming and boosting steps, it can
either be of the same or different type (e.g., DNA or bacterial or viral expression vector). One
useful prime-boost regimen provides for two priming immunizations, four weeks apart, followed
by two boosting immunizations at 4 and 8 weeks after the last priming immunization. It should
also be readily apparent to one of skill in the art that there are several permutations and
combinations that are encompassed using the DNA, bacterial and viral expression vectors of the
invention to provide priming and boosting regimens. In the event that the viral vectors express
US2-11 they can be used repeatedly while expressing different antigens derived from different
pathogens.
[00204]     A specific embodiment of the invention provides methods of inducing an immune
response against HIV in a subject by administering an immunogenic composition of the
invention, preferably comprising an US2-11 expressing adenovirus vector containing DNA
encoding one or more of the epitopes of the invention, one or more times to a subject wherein the
epitopes are expressed at a level sufficient to induce a specific immune response in the subject.
Such immunizations can be repeated multiple times at time intervals of at least 2, 4 or 6 weeks
(or more) in accordance with a desired immunization regime.
[00205]     The immunogenic compositions of the invention can be administered alone, or can be
co-administered,    or sequentially administered, with other HIV immunogens and/or HIV
immunogenic     compositions,    e.g., with "other"    immunological,  antigenic or vaccine or
therapeutic   compositions    thereby   providing    multivalent or  "cocktail"  or combination
compositions of the invention and methods of employing them.          Again, the ingredients and
manner (sequential or co-administration) of administration, as well as dosages can be determined
taking into consideration such factors as the age, sex, weight, species and condition of the
particular subject, and the route of administration.
[00206]     When used in combination, the other HIV immunogens can be administered at the
same time or at different times as part of an overall immunization regime, e.g., as part of a
prime-boost regimen or other immunization protocol. In an advantageous embodiment, the other
HIV immunogen is env, preferably the HIV env trimer.
                                                  60

[00207]     Many other HIV immunogens are known in the art, one such preferred immunogen is
HIVA (described in WO 01/47955), which can be administered as a protein, on a plasmid (e.g.,
pTHr.HIVA) or in a viral vector (e.g., MVA.HIVA). Another such HIV immunogen is RENTA
(described in PCT/US2004/037699), which can also be administered as a protein, on a plasmid
(e.g., pTHr.RENTA) or in a viral vector (e.g., MVA.RENTA).
[00208]     For example, one method of inducing an immune response against HIV in a human
subject comprises administering at least one priming dose of an HIV immunogen and at least one
boosting dose of an HIV immunogen, wherein the immunogen in each dose can be the same or
different, provided that at least one of the immunogens is an epitope of the present invention, a
nucleic acid encoding an epitope of the invention or an expression vector, preferably a VSV
vector, encoding an epitope of the invention, and wherein the immunogens are administered in
an amount or expressed at a level sufficient to induce an HIV-specific immune response in the
subject.    The HIV-specific immune response can include an HIV-specific T-cell immune
response or an HIV-specific B-cell immune response.         Such immunizations can be done at
intervals, preferably of at least 2-6 or more weeks.
[0100]      Although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail, it
should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein
without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
Examples
Example 1: Evasion of CD8' T Cells Is CriticalforSuperinfectionby Cytomegalovirus
[00209]     Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can superinfect persistently infected hosts despite CMV
specific humoral and cellular immunity; however, how it does so remains undefined. Applicants
have demonstrated that superinfection of rhesus CMV-infected rhesus macaques (RM) requires
evasion of CD8+ T cell immunity by virally encoded inhibitors of major histocompatibility
complex class I (MHC-I) antigen presentation, particularly the homologs of human CMV US2,
3, 6, and 11. In contrast, MHC-I interference was dispensable for primary infection of RM, or for
the establishment of a persistent secondary infection in CMV-infected RM transiently depleted
of CD8+ lymphocytes. These findings demonstrate that US2-11 glycoproteins promote evasion
of CD8+ T cells in vivo, thus supporting viral replication and dissemination during
                                                 61

superinfection, a process that complicates the development of preventive CMV vaccines but that
can be exploited for CMV-based vector development.
[00210]     A general characteristic of the adaptive immune response to viruses is its ability to
prevent or rapidly extinguish secondary infections by identical or closely related viruses. A
notable exception is the herpesvirus family member cytomegalovirus (CMV), which can
repeatedly establish persistent infection in immunocompetent hosts (S. B. Boppana et al. N.
Engl. J Med. 344, 1366 (2001), S. Gorman et al., J Gen. Virol. 87, 1123 (2006) and S. G.
Hansen et al., Nat. Med. 15, 293 (2009)). Sequential infections are likely the reason for the
presence of multiple human CMV (HCMV) genotypes in the human host (Meyer-K6nig et al.
Lancet 352, 1280 (1998)). This ability to establish secondary persistent infections despite the
preexistence of persistent virus (referred to as "superinfection") is particularly notable because
healthy CMV-infected individuals develop high-titer neutralizing antibody responses and
manifest very-high-frequency CD4+ and CD8+ CMV-specific T cell responses (>10% of
circulating memory T cells can be CMV-specific) (A. W. Sylwester et al., J Exp. Med. 202, 673
(2005)). This evasion of pre-existing immunity has frustrated attempts to develop preventive
CMV vaccines (S. P. Adler et al., J Infect. Dis. 171, 26 (1995) and S. A. Plotkin et al., J Infect.
Dis. 159, 860 (1989)) but can be exploited for the development of CMV vectors capable of
repeatedly initiating de novo T cell responses to heterologous pathogens in CMV-positive hosts
(S. G. Hansen et al., Nat. Med. 15, 293 (2009)).
[00211]     The biologic importance of this superinfection capability has prompted Applicants'
investigation of its extent and mechanism. Applicants previously showed that inoculation of
RhCMV* rhesus macaques (RM) with 107 plaque-forming units (PFU) of genetically modified
RhCMV (strain 68-1) expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) antigens resulted in
superinfection manifested by the persistent shedding of the genetically modified CMV in the
urine and saliva and by the induction and long-term maintenance of de novo CD4+ and CD8+ T
cell responses specific for the SIV insert (S. G. Hansen et al., Nat. Med. 15, 293 (2009)). To
determine whether RhCMV would be able to overcome immunity at lower, more physiologic
doses of infection, as reported for HCMV (S. A. Plotkin et al. J Infect. Dis. 159, 860 (1989)), a
recombinant RhCMV containing a loxP-flanked expression cassette for SIVgag [RhCMV(gagL)]
(FIG. 5) was inoculated subcutaneously at doses of 104 or 102 PFU into four RM naturally
infected by RhCMV, as manifested by the presence of robust RhCMV-specific T cell responses
                                                 62

(Table 1A). The SlVgag-specific T cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) or in broncho-alveolar lavage lymphocytes (BAL) were monitored by flow cytometric
analysis of intracellular cytokine staining (ICCS) (FIGS. 6 and 7) after stimulation with
consecutive overlapping 15-amino acid peptides corresponding to SIVgag. Reduction of the
inoculating dose had minimal impact on superinfection dynamics: All animals developed
SlVgag-specific T cell responses within 2 weeks (FIG. 1A), and secretion of SIVgag-expressing
virus in urine or buccal swabs was observed within 4 to 10 weeks of infection in both cohorts
(FIG. 1B). The time to first detection of secreted virus in these low-dose-challenged RM was not
materially different    from that of eight RhCMV           animals   infected with   107 PFU of
RhCMV(gagL) (FIG. 1B). Moreover, the SlVgag-specific T cell responses and RhCMV(gagL)
secretion were stable for more than 3 years regardless of initial dose (FIG. 1, A and C). These
data indicate that, consistent with HCMV in humans, RhCMV is able to overcome high levels of
CMV-specific immunity and to establish secondary persistent infections, even with low doses of
challenge virus.

[00213]      Applicants hypothesized that an essential step during CMV superinfection is the
ability of the virus to clear an initial immunological checkpoint. A likely candidate for such an
immunological barrier is CD8m cytotoxic T cells (CTL), because they are crucial for controlling
CMV-associated diseases (E. A. Walter et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 333, 1038 (1995)). The
importance of CTL control for CMV is also suggested by viral expression of multiple proteins
that inhibit presentation of viral peptide antigens to CD8+ T cells via major histocompatibility
complex class I (MHC-J) molecules (A. K. Pinto, A. B. Hill, Viral Immunol. 18, 434 (2005)).
HCMV encodes at least four related glycoproteins, each with a unique mechanism to prevent
antigen presentation: US2 and US 11 mediate the retrograde translocation of MHC-J into the
cytosol for proteasomal destruction (F. J. van der Wal et al. Curr. Top. Microbiol.Immunol. 269,
37 (2002)), US3 retains MHC-J in the endoplasmic reticulum by interfering with chaperone
                                                 64

controlled peptide loading (Z. Liu et al. Int. J Biochem. Cell Biol. 41, 503 (2009)), and US6
inhibits the translocation of viral and host peptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane
by the dedicated peptide transporter TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) (E. W.
Hewitt et al. EMBO J 20, 387 (2001)). RhCMV encodes sequence and functional homologs of
these genes in a genomic region spanning Rh182 (US2) to Rh189 (US 11) (FIG. 5) (N. T. Pande
et al.J Virol. 79, 5786 (2005)). Furthermore, the Rh178 gene encodes the RhCMV-specific viral
inhibitor of heavy chain expression (VIHCE), which prevents signal-sequence-dependent
translation/translocation of MHC-I (C. J. Powers, K. Frih, PLoSPathog.4, e1000150 (2008)).
[00214]     To determine whether MHC-I interference and CTL evasion played a role in the
ability of CMV to superinfect CMV+ animals, Applicants replaced the entire RhUS2-11 region
with a SIVgag expression cassette using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) mutagenesis,
resulting in virus AUS2-11(gag). Applicants also deleted Rh178 to generate AVIHCEAUS2
1 1(gag) (FIG. 5). Applicants previously showed that MHC-I expression is partially restored upon
US2-11 deletion, whereas additional deletion of Rh178 fully restores MHC-I expression in
RhCMV-infected fibroblasts (C. J. Powers, K. Friih, PLoS Pathog.4, e1000150 (2008)). In vitro
analysis showed that all viruses were deleted for the targeted RhCMV open reading frames
(ORFs), did not contain any unwanted mutations, and replicated comparably to wild-type
RhCMV (FIGS. 8 and 9). First, Applicants examined whether these viruses were able to infect
animals that were CMV-naive as shown by a lack of CMV-specific T cell responses (Table 1B).
Three groups of animals were challenged with 107 PFU of AUS2-1 1(gag)                   (n =  2),
AVIHCEAUS2-11(gag) (n         =  2), or BAC-derived (wild-type) RhCMV(gag) (n        = 2). T cell
responses against both CMV and SIVgag in PBMC and against SIVgag in BAL were
comparable between animals infected with the deletion mutants and the wild-type RhCMV(gag)
control (FIG. 2A). Moreover, all animals secreted SIVgag-expressing virus from day 56 onward
for the duration of the experiment (>700 days) (FIG. 2B). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
analysis of DNA isolated from urine cocultured virus at day 428 confirmed that the secreted
viruses lacked the respective gene regions and were able to persist in the host (FIG. 2C).
Together these results show that viral MHC-I interference is dispensable for primary infection
and the establishment and maintenance of persistent infection, despite the development of a
substantial CMV-specific T cell response.
                                                 65

[00215]     To examine whether viral MHC-I interference was required for superinfection of
RhCMV+ RM, Applicants challenged two cohorts of four naturally infected RM each with 107
PFU of AVIHCEAUS2-11(gag) or RhCMV(gag). All animals displayed immediate early gene
(IE)- specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses before challenge (FIG. 3A and Table IC). In
keeping with previous results (S. G. Hansen et al., Nat. Med. 15, 293 (2009)), RM inoculated
with wild-type RhCMV(gag) displayed boosting of the RhCMV-specific T cell response and
developed a SlVgag-specific immune response (FIG. 3, A and B, insets). They also secreted
SIVgag-expressing virus (FIG. 3C). In contrast, Applicants did not detect SlVgag-specific T cell
responses in PBMC or BAL in RM inoculated with AVIHCEAUS2-1 1(gag), even after repeated
inoculation (FIG. 3, A and B), and SIVgag-expressing virus was not detected in secretions (FIG.
3C). These results suggested that MHC-I interference was essential for superinfection.
Inoculation of the same animals with AUS2-1 1(gag) and, later, AVIHCE(gag) demonstrated that
superinfection required the conserved US2-11       region but not the VIHCE region. The
development of SlVgag-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in blood and BAL (FIG. 3, A
and B), as well as the boosting of preexisting RhCMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ Tcell responses
in blood (FIG. 3A), or shedding of SIVgag-expressing RhCMV (FIG. 3D) were only detectable
after challenge with AVIHCE(gag) but not with AUS2-1 1(gag).
[00216]     Applicants' results show that genes within the US2-11 region are essential for
superinfection, which is consistent with the known function of US2, US3, US6, and US 11 as
inhibitors of MHC-I antigen presentation. There are, however, three genes of unknown function
(Rhl86 to Rhl88) encoded between US6 and US 11. Rhl86 and Rhl87 are most closely related
to the HCMV glycoproteins US8 and US1O, respectively (N. T. Pande et al. J Virol. 79, 5786
(2005)), whereas Rhl88 is an uncharacterized RhCMV-specific ORF. Although binding of
HCMV-US8 and US1O to MHC-I has been reported, it is unclear whether this affects antigen
presentation because MHC-I surface expression is not reduced by US8 or US1O from either
HCMV or RhCMV (N. T. Pande et al.J Virol. 79, 5786 (2005), R. S. Tirabassi, H. L. Ploegh, J
Virol. 76, 6832 (2002) and M. H. Furman et al., J Virol. 76, 11753 (2002)). To determine
whether Rhl86, Rhl87, or Rhl88 are required for superinfection, Applicants generated deletion
virus ARh186-8. To enable us to monitor superinfection by this recombinant in the same cohort
of animals that had already been reinfected with AVIHCE(gag), Applicants applied a distinct
immunological marker, SIVretanef, a fusion-protein consisting of SIV proteins rev, tat, and nef
                                               66

(S. G. Hansen et al., Nat. Med. 15, 293 (2009)). ARhl86-8(retanef) is deleted for Rh186-188 and
contains the Retanef expression cassette between the ORFs Rh213 and Rh214 (FIG. 5).
Applicants inoculated the same cohort with ARh186-8(retanef) and monitored the T cell
response to this fusion protein as well as to RhCMV-IE and SIVgag using corresponding
peptides. As shown in FIG. 3, A and B, all four RM developed a SIVretanef-specific T cell
response within 2 weeks post-challenge, indicating successful superinfection. Moreover, virus
expressing SIVretanef was shed in the secretions of infected animals together with SIVgag
expressing AVIHCE(gag) (FIG. 3D). Applicants thus conclude that the RhI86-8 region is
dispensable for superinfection.
[00217]     Together, Applicants' results suggested that RhCMV was unable to superinfect in the
absence of the homologs of US2, US3, US6, and US1I because the virus was no longer able to
avoid elimination by CTL. To further examine this hypothesis, a new group of RhCMV+ RM
(Table ID) was depleted for CD8+ lymphocytes by treatment with cM-T807, a humanized
monoclonal antibody to CD8, before superinfection with AUS2-11(gag) or AVIHCEAUS2
1 1(gag). Flow cytometric analysis of total CD8+ T cells revealed that depletion was extensive,
but transient, with detectable CD8+ T cell recovery beginning on day 21 after challenge (FIG. 4,
A and B). Upon inoculation with AUS2-11(gag) or AVIHCEAUS2-11(gag), SlVgag-specific
CD4+ T cell responses were recorded as early as day 7 post-challenge, showing the ability of the
deletion viruses to superinfect these animals (FIG. 4C). Moreover, SlVgag-specific CD8+ T cells
were observed within the rebounding CD8+ T cells in blood and BAL at day 21 in two RM and
at day 28 in a third; in the fourth RM, such responses were only observed in BAL after day 56.
From these data, Applicants conclude that CD8+ lymphocytes, most likely CD8+ T cells, were
essential for preventing superinfection by AUS2-11 virus, strongly indicating that the MHC-I
inhibitory function of these molecules is necessary for superinfection of the CMV-positive host.
Notably, CMV-specific CD8+ T cells were unable to eliminate RhCMV lacking MHC-I
inhibitors once persistent infection had been established (FIG. 4D), providing additional
evidence that persistent infection is insensitive to CD8+ T cell immunity, even when the ability
of the virus to prevent MHC-I presentation is compromised.
[00218]     Applicants' data imply that T cell evasion is not required for establishment of primary
CMV infection or once the sites of persistence (e.g., kidney and salivary gland epithelial cells)
have been occupied, but rather it is essential to enable CMV to reach these sites of persistence
                                                 67

from the peripheral site of inoculation in the CMV-immune host. One possible scenario is that
viral infection of circulating cells, for example, monocytes, can succeed only if the virus
prevents elimination of these cells by virus-specific CTLs. More work, however, will be required
to identify the cell type supporting superinfection.
[00219]      Although the biochemical and cell biological functions of US2, US3, US6, and US 11
have been studied extensively (C. Powers et al. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 325, 333
(2008)), their role in viral pathogenesis had remained enigmatic. Analogous gene functions in
murine CMV (MCMV) had been similarly found to be dispensable for both primary and
persistent infection (A. K. Pinto, A. B. Hill, Viral Immunol. 18, 434 (2005)), although reduced
viral titers have been reported for MCMV deleted for these genes (A. Krmpotic et al., J Exp.
Med. 190, 1285 (1999)). Thus, the reason all known CMVs dedicate multiple gene products to
MHC-I downregulation had remained elusive. Applicants' current results now identify a critical
role for these immunomodulators          to enable superinfection     of the CMV-positive host.
Furthermore, these results suggest that the ability to superinfect is an evolutionary conserved
function among CMVs and therefore might play an important role in the biology of these viruses.
Superinfection could promote the maintenance of genetic diversity of CMV strains in a highly
infected host population, which could provide an evolutionary advantage. However, there is
another possibility. CMV is a large virus with thousands of potential T cell epitopes and
therefore a high potential for CD8+ T cell cross-reactivity (L. K. Selin et al., Immunol. Rev. 211,
164 (2006)). Indeed, in a study of pan-proteome HCMV T cell responses, 40% of HCMV
seronegative subsets manifested one or more cross-reactive CD8+ T cell responses to HCMV
encoded epitopes (A. W. Sylwester et al., J Exp. Med. 202, 673 (2005)). As CMV recognition
by cytotoxic T cells appears to effectively block primary CMV infection, individuals with cross
reactive CD8+ T cell immunity might be resistant to CMV. Thus, US2-11 function may be
necessary to evade such responses and establish infection in this large population of individuals
that might otherwise be CMV-resistant.
[00220]      Applicants' results also may explain why, so far, it has not been possible to develop a
vaccine that efficiently protects humans from HCMV infection. Although antibody-mediated
mucosal immunity might reduce the rate of superinfection (S. A. Plotkin et al. J Infect. Dis. 159,
860 (1989) and L. K. Selin et al., Immunol. Rev. 211, 164 (2006)), once this layer of defense is
breached, CMV-specific CTLs seem to be unable to prevent viral dissemination, due to MHC-I
                                                  68

down-regulation by US2-1 1. Thus, although CMVvaccines might be able to limit CMV viremia
and associated morbidity, this MHC-I interference renders it unlikely that sterilizing protection
against CMV infection is an achievable goal.
[00221]     Antibodies. The following antibodies were used for immunoblots: anti-Gag Ab from
the NIH AIDS Repository for all SIVgag expressing RhCMV recombinants or anti-FLAG
(Sigma) for FLAGtagged SIVgag; anti-V5 (Invitrogen) for V5-tagged SIVretanef and anti
calreticulin (SPA-601, StressGen) for control. Anti-RhCMV-IE1 was described previously (S. G.
Hansen et al., Nat Med 15, 293 (2009)). The following antibodies used in flow cytometry were
from BD Bioscience: L200 (CD4; AmCyan); SP34-2 (CD3; Alex700, PacBlu); SKI (CD8alpha;
TruRed); DX2 (CD95; PE); 25723.11 (IFN-y; APC); 6.7 (TNF; FITC). The following antibodies
were obtained from Beckman Coulter: CD28.2 (CD28; PE-Texas Red); L78 (CD69; PE).
[00222]     Construction of Recombinant RhCMV. All recombinant viruses used in this study
were derived from strain RhCMV 68-1 (S. G. Hansen et al. J Virol 77, 6620 (2003)) and are
graphically depicted in FIG. 5. RhCMV(gagL) was generated by replacing the loxP-flanked
enhanced green-fluorescent protein (EGFP) in RhCMV-EGFP (W. L. Chang et al. J Virol 76,
9493 (2002)) with a loxP-flanked expression cassette for SIVmac239-gag under control of the
EFla-promoter by in vivo recombination in tissue culture. All other recombinant viruses were
created using the RhCMV bacterial artificial chromosome (RhCMV-BAC) (W. L. Chang, P. A.
Barry, J Virol 77, 5073 (2003)) (FIG. 5). The BAC-cassette was inserted between the RhCMV
homologs of USI and US2 and self-excises via Cre-recombinase (W. L. Chang, P. A. Barry, J
Virol 77, 5073 (2003)). Recombinant virus RhCMV(gag) contains a codon-optimized, FLAG
tagged SIVmac239-gag sequence under control of the EFla-promoter inserted between ORFs
R213 and R214 (S. G. Hansen et al., Nat Med 15, 293 (2009)). Deletion of the US2-11 region by
homologous recombination (ET cloning) with an FRT-flanked Kanamycin-resistance (KanR)
cassette was described previously (C. J. Powers, K. Friih, PLoS Pathog 4, e1000150 (2008)).
AUS2-11(gag) was created by replacing the entire Rh182-189 region (base pairs 184489
191243) using the same primers and mutagenesis strategy as before (C. J. Powers, K. Friih, PLoS
Pathog 4, e1000150 (2008)) except that the inserted fragment harbored both the KanR cassette
and the codon-optimized, FLAG-tagged SIVgag-cassette. The KanR-cassette was removed by
arabinose-induced FLP-expression (C. J. Powers, K. Frih, PLoS Pathog 4, e1000150 (2008)).
AVIHCEAUS2-11(gag) was created by subsequent deletion of Rh178 (VIHCE; base pairs
                                               69

181320-182060). Since AUS2-11(gag) contains a single FRT recombination site from KanR
excision, Applicants used a KanR cassette flanked by the F5-mutant FRT sequence for deletion
of VIHCE. This prevents potential recombination between new and existing FRT sites when
creating dual-recombinants. The mutant FRT-flanked KanR cassette was obtained from plasmid
pOri6K-F5 (E. M. Borst, M. Messerle, J             Virol 79, 3615 (2005)) using primers 5'

RhCMV(retanef) (S. G. Hansen et al., Nat Med 15, 293 (2009)) by deletion of base pairs
187934-190031 using the KanR- cassette flanked by the F5-mutant FRT sites. All recombinant
BACs were verified for correct deletions by restriction digest, southern blot and sequence
analysis of the insert-borders. RhCMV virus was reconstituted by electroporation of telomerized
rhesus fibroblasts (TRFs) (V. Kirchoff et al. Arch Virol 147, 321 (2002)).
[00223]     Characterization of recombinant viruses by RT-PCR. Resulting viruses were
plaque-purified and characterized for gene expression of deleted and flanking genes by RT-PCR
(FIG. 8). TRFs were infected at MOI=1 and total RNA was collected at 24hpi using RNeasy
mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 4pLg of RNA was treated with
DNAse I (Applied Biosystems) for 30 min at 370 C. lptg of DNAse-treated RNA was used in a
20pl reverse transcription reaction containing 50ng random hexamers, 0.5mM dNTPs, 10mM
DTT, and 1 pl superscript III RT in 1x RT buffer (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 3 7C. 1 d of the RT
reaction was used for semi-quantitative PCR with Platinum taq polymerase (Invitrogen) under
the following conditions: 1x platinum taq buffer, 1.5mM MgCl 2 , 0.2mM dNTPs, 0.5pM each
primer, and 1.5U polymerase. 35 cycles of amplification was performed under the following
conditions: 94'C for 30 sec, 55 0 C for 30 sec, and 72'C for 15 sec. The following primer pairs

[00224]     Characterization of recombinant viruses by comparative genome sequencing. To
confirm that the genetic manipulation of the RhCMV genome did not introduce unwanted
mutations outside the regions targeted for deletion, Applicants used Comparative Genome
Sequencing (CGS) to compare the deletion viruses against RhCMV-BAC. Single nucleotide
differences between reference and test strains of herpesviruses can be identified with CGS (0.
Timoshenko et al.JMed Virol 81, 511 (2009) and D. Estep et al. J Virol 81, 2957 (2007)). CGS
of viral DNA was performed using a microarray hybridization-based technique with services
provided by NimbleGen Systems, Inc. (Madison, WI). A RhCMV comparative genomic
hybridization array was created using the published sequence for RhCMV 68.1 (S. G. Hansen et
al. J Virol 77, 6620 (2003)). Oligonucleotides that comprised this array were designed to be
between 29 and 32 bp, with overlapping sequences of at least 7 bp, with coverage of both strands
of the RhCMV 68.1 genome. Viral DNA was isolated using standard methods from a) parental
RhCMV-BAC (W. L. Chang, P. A. Barry, J Virol 77, 5073 (2003)), b) AVIHCEAUS2-1 1(gag),
c) AUS2-11(gag), or d) AVIHCE(gag). Briefly, virus was produced in telomerized rhesus
                                               71

fibroblasts (TRFs), supernatants were collected and, after proteinase K treatment, DNA was
isolated by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. The resulting viral DNA was ethanol
precipitated and brought to a final concentration of 1tg/p. Viral DNA was fragmented and
labeled with Cy3 (RhCMV-BAC as reference) or Cy5 (deletion viruses). Labeled reference and
test viral DNA probes were co-hybridized to the tiling arrays and the Cy3 and Cy5 signals were
scanned. SignalMap software (NimbleGen Systems, Inc.) was used to analyze all CGS data.
[00225]     Rhesus macaques. A total of 28 purpose-bred juvenile and adult male rhesus
macaques (RM) (Macaca mulatta) of Indian genetic background were used in this study, of
which four animals were specific pathogen-free (SPF) animals and lacked RhCMV-specific T
cells and antibodies. All other animals used in the study acquired RhCMV naturally while in the
colony. The presence or absence of RhCMV-specific T cell responses was confirmed by
intracellular cytokine staining of RhCMV Ag-stimulated PBMC (Table 1). All RM were free of
cercopithicine herpesvirus 1, D-type simian retrovirus, simian T-lymphotrophic virus type 1 and
SIV infection. Animal protocols were approved by the Oregon National Primate Research Center
Animal Care and Use Committee, under the standards of the US National Institutes of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animals were inoculated with 102-107 PFU of
recombinant virus subcutaneously. For CD8+ cell depletion, RM were treated with 10, 5, 5 and 5
mg per kg body weight of the humanized monoclonal antibody cM-T807 (J. E. Schmitz et al.,
Am J Pathol 154, 1923 (1999)) one day before viral infection and on days 2, 6, and 9 post
infection, respectively.
[00226]     Virological analysis of rhesus macaques. Isolation and co-culture of virus from
urine and buccal swabs was performed as described previously (S. G. Hansen et al., Nat Med 15,
293 (2009)). Briefly, virus was concentrated from cleared urine and co-cultured with rhesus
fibroblasts and cell lysates were collected after cytopathic effects were observed or after 28 days.
[00227]     PCR analysis of co-cultured virus. Supernatant from cells prepared from urine co
cultures was used to infect fresh TRFs. When the cells reached 90-100% cytopathic effect, total
DNA was collected. Cells were scraped and lysed in 300ptl of a buffer containing 10mM Tris
HCl, pH 8.5, 5mM EDTA, 0.2M NaCl, and 0.2% SDS for 5 minutes at 60'C, followed by
addition of 10tg RNAse A and 5pl proteinase K (Fermentas, ~20mg/mL) for 1 hour at 60'C.
Protein was then precipitated with 150pd of 5M NaCl and incubated on ice for 5 min. Debris was
pelleted at 16000xg for 15 min, supernatant removed, and DNA precipitated with 450pl
                                                  72

isopropanol. 50ng of DNA was used for PCR analysis under the following conditions: 1x
platinum taq buffer, 1.5mM MgCl2, 0.2mM dNTPs, 0.5pM each primer, and 1.5 U platinum taq
polymerase. 35 cycles of amplification was performed under the following conditions: 94'C for
30 sec, 55'C for 30 sec, and 72'C for 80 sec. The following primer pairs were used: Rh156 5'

[00228]     Immunological analysis of rhesus macaques. Collection of BAL was performed as
described previously (C. J. Pitcher et al., J Immunol 168, 29 (2002)). CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
responses were measured by flow cytometric intracellular cytokine analysis of PBMC and BAL
cells, as previously described (S. G. Hansen et al., Nat Med 15, 293 (2009)). For T cell
stimulation assays RhCMV lysates (68-1 strain) or overlapping 15mer peptides representing the
SIVmac239 Gag, Rev/Tat/Nef proteins or the RhCMV Immediate Early-i and 2 proteins
(overlap =  11 amino acids), were used in the presence of co-stimulatory mAbs CD28 and CD49d
(BD Biosciences). Co-stimulation in the absence of antigen served as a background control.
Cells were incubated with antigen and the costimulatory molecules alone for 1 hr, and then in the
presence of the secretion inhibitor Brefeldin A (10ptg/ml; Sigma Aldrich) for an additional 8 hrs.
After surface and intracellular staining with conjugated mAbs, polychromatic (6 to 8 parameter)
flow cytometric analysis was performed on an LSR II Becton Dickinson instrument. List mode
multi-parameter data files were analyzed using the FlowJO software program (version 8.8.6;
Tree Star, Inc.). Using this software CD3' cells were divided into CD4+ and CD8+ T cells subsets,
and then analyzed for a subset manifesting up-regulation of the activation marker CD69 and
cytokine, either TNFa alone (FIG. 1 data), or TNFa and/or IFN- 7 (FIGS. 2-4 data) (see FIG. 6).
For PBMCs, this background-subtracted value was divided by the fraction of total memory cells
(determined as described below) to achieve the reported "memory corrected" response frequency
(C. J. Pitcher et al., J Immunol 168, 29 (2002)). For BAL, the reported responses were
background response (no antigen) subtracted only, as BAL T cells are entirely memory cells. (C.
J. Pitcher et al., J Immunol 168, 29 (2002)). To determine the memory fraction of circulating T
                                                 73

cells, memory and naive T cell subset populations were delineated based on CD28 and CD95
expression patterns, as described in (C. J. Pitcher et al., JImmunol 168, 29 (2002))(see FIG. 7).
Example 2
[00229]     In this Example, Applicants develop a number of attenuated RhCMV-vaccines to
examine the highest level of attenuation that can still achieve protection against AUS2-1 1-Gag.
A limitation of Applicants' preliminary data was that Applicants had only shown that natural
infection with RhCMV was protective against re-infection with AUS2-1 1, but Applicants had yet
to demonstrate that experimental infection with recombinant RhCMV would be protective.
Applicants now demonstrate that a recombinant virus lacking the major tegument proteins pp65a
and pp65b or pp7l protects against re-infection by AUS2-1 1-Gag.
[00230]     PP65 is one of the most abundant proteins in HCMV particles and the most abundant
component of the viral tegument, an amorphous protein structure layered between the capsid and
the envelope. In addition to its role in evading innate immune responses, pp65 is one of the most
immunogenic proteins encoded by HCMV and it is therefore included in most experimental
vaccines and pp65-specific T cells are routinely included in adoptive transfer protocols.
However, the role of pp65 for acute and persistent infection in vivo has never been examined.
[00231]     RhCMV encodes two homologues of HCMV pp65 (UL83), pp65a (RhI 11) and
pp65b (Rh112). Using BAC-mutagenesis, Applicants deleted Rh111 and Rh112 from the
RhCMV genome. ARh111-2 does not show a growth defect in fibroblast cultures (data not
shown). Applicants infected two sero-negative animals with 5x10      6 pfu of ARh111-2. Infection
was monitored immunologically over the following months (FIG. 10). Both animals developed a
robust CMV-specific CD4+ T cell response as measured by intracellular cytokine staining. In
contrast to animals infected with WT-RhCMV (a representative animal is shown in FIG. 10),
neither of the ARh 11-2-infected animals developed an immune response to pp65. To examine
whether the anti-CMV immune response of two ARh 111-2-infected animals was comparable to
natural infection with respect to protection against AUS2-1 1-deleted virus, Applicants inoculated
107 pfu of AUS2-11-Gag s.c. and monitored the Gag-specific immune response. However,
neither of the animals developed a CD4+ or CD8+ T cell response to Gag in PBMC whereas
they remained positive for IE (FIG. 11, shown are the average responses).
[00232]     Surprisingly, pp65 does not seem to be required for primary infection of CMV-naive
animals by RhCMV.         These data further demonstrate that experimental          infection with
                                                 74

recombinant RhCMV can protect against re-infection with AUS2-11. Interestingly, AUS2-11
protective T cell immunity does not seem to depend on pp65-specific T cells despite its
immunodominance during natural infection in both human and rhesus CMV.
[00233]      RhCMV/S1V vectors can 1) establish persistent infection in RhCMV-seropositive
rhesus macaques (RM), 2) elicit potent, long-lasting SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
responses with a strong "effector memory" (TEM) bias (see FIG. 16), and 3) protect           -50% of
vaccinated RM from progressive SIV infection after limiting dose, intra-rectal challenge with the
highly pathogenic SIVmac239 virus (see FIG. 10). The protection manifested in RhCMV/SIV
vaccinated RM is distinct from previous T cell SIV vaccines in its abruptness and extent, with
protected RM manifesting a viral burst in plasma of varying size upon initial infection, followed
by immediate control to undetectable levels. While these RM may subsequently show periodic,
low level "blips" of viremia, CD4+ memory depletion is not observed and SIV-specific antibody
(Ab) responses do not boost, indicating a very high level of control. Moreover, to date, this
stringent control has been stable for >30 weeks in 16/17 protected RM. Protection correlates with
peak total SIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses in blood during the vaccine phase, which likely
reflects the degree to which these cells are seeded into effector tissues. Taken together, these data
indicate a novel pattern of protection consistent with very early control, likely occurring at the
site of viral entry or early sites of viral replication and amplification, and mediated by tissue
resident CD8+   TEM.  Significantly, the epitope targeting of RhCMV-vectored SIV-specific CD8+
T cell responses is distinct from responses elicited by conventional viral vectors or SIV itself:
RhCMV-vectored CD8+ T cells target a broad array of (likely cross-presented) epitopes that
exclude the typical immunodominant epitopes (e.g., CM9 or TL8 in Mamu A*01+ RM) that are
internally processed in and presented by virally infected cells (see FIG. 20). This differential
CD8+ T cell targeting of wildtype (wt) RhCMV vectors is mediated by the activity of RhCMV
genes that inhibit class I MHC-restricted Ag presentation (US2-11 homologues), as US2-11
deletant RhCMV vectors elicit CD8+ T cell responses that include prominent responses to the
conventional SIV epitopes (see FIGS. 17, 19 and 20). In this Example, Applicants define the
immunobiology of RhCMV/SIV vector-mediated protection, including the mechanisms, timing
and location of protection, and the impact of differential CD8+ T epitope targeting on the
efficiency of SIV control, in particular asking whether broadening RhCMV/SIV-vectored CD8+
                                                  75

T cell responses to include typical dominant epitopes can improve response quality and enhance
efficacy. The goals of this Example are:
[00234]     The differential epitope targeting patterns and breadth of SIV-specific CD8+ T cells
elicited by wt vs. (MHC I-down-regulation-null) US2-11-deletant RhCMV/SIV vectors is
hypothesized to correlate with their breadth and efficacy; US2-1 1 deletant vectors direct vector
elicited CD8+ T cell responses to include typical internally processed epitopes (see FIGS. 19 and
20). Such vectors might therefore have enhanced efficacy against limiting dose intra-rectal
SIVmac239 challenge compared to wt vectors. By homology, US2-11 deleted HCMV-vectors
carrying HIV antigens are expected to induce a broader T cell response to HIV epitopes which
might correlate with better protection
[00235]     HIV infections of humans and SIV infections of Asian macaques share a pattern of
viral replication and a constellation of pathologic features that in the absence of effective anti
retroviral   therapy  results  in  unremitting   infection,  and progressive,    ultimately   fatal,
immunodeficiency in the vast majority of infected individuals (Levy, J.A. 1993. Microbiol Rev
57:183-289. Grovit-Ferbas, K. et al. 1999. Human Immunodeficiency Virus. In Persistent Viral

D.M. Knipe, and P.M. Howley, editors. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. 2043
2094). A striking feature of these infections is their induction of robust cellular and humoral
immunity, which fails to clear or, in most subjects, even effectively control viral replication.
HIV/SIV adaptations that provide for efficient immune evasion include 1) massive replication,
high mutation rates, genetic malleability and functional plasticity leading to rapid evolution,
2) specific genetic mechanisms to thwart innate and adaptive immune mechanisms (e.g.,
countering tetherin, APOBEC, Trim5u innate anti-viral mechanisms and cytotoxic T cells by
class 1 MHC down-regulation), 3) env adaptations to avoid antibody (Ab) neutralization, 4)
latency, and 5) dysregulated immune function (Evans, D.T., and Desrosiers, R.C. 2001. Immunol
Rev 183:141-158, Johnson, W.E., and Desrosiers, R.C. 2002. Annu Rev Med 53:499-518,

Emerman, M. 2008. Cell Host Microbe 3:388-398 and Frost, S.D. et al. 2008. Curr Opin HIV
AIDS 3:45-51). These mechanisms pose an imposing set of challenges for developing an
effective HIV/AIDS vaccine, but fortunately, it is increasingly clear that HIV/SIV do have
immune vulnerabilities. CD8+ T cell responses, and to a lesser extent, Ab responses can
modulate viral replication, and in certain circumstances can manifest sufficient anti-viral activity
to control, albeit not eliminate, infection (Goulder, P.J., and Watkins, D.I. 2008. Nat Rev
Immunol 8:619-630, Frost, S.D. et al. 2008. Curr Opin HIV AIDS 3:45-51, Baker, B.M. et al.
2009. Expert Opin Biol Ther 9:55-69 and Goonetilleke, N. et al. 2009. J Exp Med 206:1253
1272). In HIV/SIV infections of naive subjects, most adaptive immune responses develop only
after substantial systemic viral replication has already occurred, and therefore, for these
responses to manifest virologic control, they must be of superlative potency and/or have optimal
epitope targeting to prevent viral evolution and escape. However, there is increasing evidence
that the initial viral bridgehead in the first few days after mucosal exposure, made by one or two
viral species (Keele, B.F. et al. 2008. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 105:7552-7557), is much more
vulnerable. At this stage, immunity would act on a much smaller, less diverse and localized viral
population, and if such responses could suppress the viral reproductive ratio (Ro) to < 1, the
infection may fail to establish altogether (Haase, A.T. 2005. Nat Rev Immunol 5:783-792).
Indeed, increasing evidence        suggests that immunity has the potential to prevent and/or
stringently control HIV/SIV infection, but the window of opportunity for this high level
protection is almost certainly both early and short.
[00236]      The association of elite HIV/SIV control in humans and non-human primates (NHP)
with CD8+ T cell responses targeting particular epitopes restricted by specific class I MHC
alleles led to the hypothesis that a vaccine capable of eliciting strong and broadly targeted virus
specific CD8+ T cell memory might, upon infection, bring to bear sufficient immunologic
pressure on vulnerable viral sequences to suppress viral replication and/or force genetic changes
resulting in reduced viral fitness (Walker, B.D., and Burton, D.R. 2008. Science 320:760-764
and Watkins, D.I. et al. 2008. Nat Med 14:617-621). While not expected to prevent infection, it
was hypothesized that such a vaccine-elicited T cell response would reduce median peak and
plateau-phase viral loads in the population, and thereby, on average, slow pathogenesis, and
reduce the likelihood of transmission. In the past few years, this concept has been extensively
evaluated in the Indian-origin RM/SIVmac model using increasingly potent vectors and prime
                                                   77

boost combinations, and a variety of challenge routes and doses. The general conclusions from
these studies are that, compared to naive RM, the best vaccine regimens can indeed reduce peak
and plateau-phase viral loads of highly pathogenic SIVmac viruses and extend survival.
However, protection is 1) uneven within identically vaccinated RM cohorts (and often correlated
with protective MHC alleles), 2) seemingly limited to ~1.5-2 log mean reduction in peak and
plateauphase plasma viral loads with SIVmac challenge, and 3) subject to reversion over time
(18-29). This pattern of protection is similar for intravenous, high (single) and low (repeated)
dose mucosal challenge, and appears to derive from a massive anamnestic CD8+ T cell response
after infection that "intercepts" viral replication fairly late during systemic spread, with anti-viral
activity first manifested by a blunting of peak SIV replication at day 10 to 14. As illustrated in
FIG. 12, the CD8+ memory T cells that result from prime-boost vaccines with non-replicating
vectors are dramatically expandable upon infection, but the proliferation, differentiation and
effector cell delivery to viral replication sites is quite delayed relative to viral kinetics, a temporal
relationship that clearly limits both the extent and durability of protection. Indeed, the first test of
this concept in humans, the phase 2b Merck STEP trial (HVTN 502), was a clear failure. Despite
detection of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in 73% of vaccinees, there was no evidence of protection
in terms of infection acquisition or post-infection viral replication (Buchbinder, S.P. et al. 2008.
Lancet 372:1881-1893, McElrath, M.J. et al. 2008. Lancet 372:1894-1905). The STEP regimen
may, in retrospect, have been insufficiently potent (or unable to elicit a sufficiently broad HIV
specific CD8+ T cell response) to achieve significant protection, but the results clearly illustrate
the difficulty in attaining meaningful efficacy with a vaccine designed to elicit conventional
CD8+ memory T cells.
[00237]      If conventional vaccine-elicited T cell memory (memory responses that, upon initial
pathogen encounter, require effector expansion, differentiation and migration to mediate anti
viral activity) intervenes too late in HIV/SIV infection, the alternative is a vaccine designed to
elicit and maintain "effector memory" T cells      (TEM). TEM  lack robust expansion capacity, but are
localized in effector sites and poised for immediate effector function (Bannard, 0. et al. 2009.
Eur J Immunol 39:2083-2087, Hansen, S.G. et al. 2009. Nat Med 15:293-299, Sallusto, F. et al.
2004. Annu Rev Immunol 22:745-763, Picker, L.J. et al. 2006. J Clin Invest 116:1514-1524,
Pitcher, C.J. et al. 2002. J Immunol 168:29-43 and Genesca, M. et al. 2009. J Intern Med 265:67
77). Indeed, CD4+ TEM are the primary targets of HIV/SIV (Grossman, Z. et al. 2006. Nat Med
                                                    78

12:289-295), and as CD4+ and CD8+       TEM  cohabit the same sites, a vaccine-generated CD8+ TEM
response would theoretically be ideally positioned to intercept initial/early viral replication in
primary infection, providing anti-viral effector activity during the most vulnerable phase of
infection. Long-term maintenance of       TEM  populations is associated with persistent Ag, and
conversely, a pronounced TEM bias characterizes T cell responses to chronic/persistent agents, in
particular CMV (Hansen, S.G. et al. 2009. Nat Med 15:293-299, 35, 38-40). Applicants therefore
initiated a RhCMV vector development program to assess the ability of TEM to intervene early in
primary SIV infection. As recently described (Hansen, S.G. et al. 2009. Nat Med 15:293-299,
Picker, L.J., Reed-Inderbitzin, E.F., Hagen, S.I., Edgar, J.B., Hansen, S.G., Legasse, A., Planer,

2672, Kern, F. et al. 1999. Eur J Immunol 29:2908-2915, Champagne, P. et al. 2001. Nature
410:106-111), RhCMV can be modified to highly express SIV proteins, without disruption of
other RhCMV genes, and with preservation of wildtype growth characteristics (in vitro and in
vivo). These vectors can re-infect RhCMV-seropositive RM in a clinically silent manner, and in
the process of re-infection elicit indefinitely persistent, high frequency CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
responses against the SIV gene products. These RhCMV-vector elicited SIV-specific T cell
responses manifest a polyfunctional, highly TEM-biased phenotype, and in keeping with this
phenotype were highly enriched in effector sites [(Hansen, S.G. et al. 2009. Nat Med 15:293
299); and see FIG. 16]. RhCMV/SIV vectors do not elicit significant SIV-specific Ab responses,
nor do they appear even to prime for such responses (Hansen, S.G. et al. 2009. Nat Med 15:293
299). In the first efficacy assessment of these vectors, RM immunized with RhCMV/gag,
/rev/nef/tat, and /env were challenged with repeated, limiting dose intra-rectal SIVmac239 at
486-615 days after the last vaccination. This challenge protocol was designed to infect RM via
mucosal exposure with viral doses more akin to sexual HIV transmission in humans (24).
Applicants found that 4/12 vaccinees (vs. 0/16 controls) were demonstrably infected with SIV
but completely controlled infection, to the extent that CD8+ cell depletion failed to elicit viral
recrudescence (Hansen, S.G. et al. 2009. Nat Med 15:293-299). As described in detail below,
these initial results have been confirmed and extended in a second large RM efficacy using the
same repeated, limiting dose SIVmac239 challenge. Overall, ~50% of RhCMV/SIV-vaccinated
RM have been highly protected from progressive SIV infection after intra-rectal challenge with
highly pathogenic, CCR5-tropic SIV.
                                                 79

[00238]     Worldwide in 2007, there were ~2.5 million new HIV infections, over 33 million
people living with HIV and 2.1 million AIDS deaths (2008 UNAIDS Report). In southern
Africa, adult prevalence rates can exceed 15%. An effective prophylactic vaccine would have a
tremendous impact on the epidemic, and is likely the only way it can be conquered. As discussed
above, HIV is an extremely difficult vaccine target, and an effective HIV/AIDS vaccine most
likely has to include multiple components, each designed to exploit different viral immune
vulnerabilities and acting at different stages of primary infection (FIG. 13). CMV vectors (and
the  "TEM"  vaccine concept) offer a powerful new addition to this vaccine "arsenal", and it thus
becomes a high priority to both define the mechanism(s) by which these vectors protect and
optimize their efficacy. This information is critical for the "translation" of CMV vectors into the
clinic, as well as for developing other modalities that would utilize or enhance the same
protective mechanism(s). It should also be emphasized that the early protection mediated by
CMV vector-elicited responses offers both a new window to explore and a new means to
experimentally manipulate early HIV/SIV-immune system interactions. Thus, the understanding
of TEM biology and mechanisms by which CMV vector-elicited            TEM  protect sheds light on the
crucial early events that follow mucosal HIV/SIV infection. This Example addresses these
priorities by providing detailed analysis of 1) the distribution and functional characteristics of
RhCMV vector-elicited, SIV-specific T cells and the relationship between these characteristics
and efficacy, 2) where and how these responses "intercept" and suppress mucosally administered
SIV in primary infection, and control SIV replication over the long-term, and 3) the differential
CD8+ T cell epitope targeting mediated by US2-11 gene function in wt vs. mutant CMV/SIV
vectors, and the impact of this differential targeting on efficacy.
[00239]     Applicants have accomplished all of the above goals, including construction,
optimization, and selection of RhCMV vectors expressing SIVgag, rev/nef/tat, env and pol,
extensive assessment of vector biology and immunogenicity, and most importantly, efficacy
assessment and delineation of immune correlates. The hypothesis that RhCMV vectors and the
TEM responses they elicit can be efficacious against highly pathogenic SIV has been confirmed,
and a new pattern of early protection has been discovered. The details of these accomplishments
are described in Hansen, et al. (Hansen, S.G. et al. 2009. Nat Med 15:293-299).
[00240]     Applicants followed the promising results of Applicants' first efficacy assessment of
RhCMV/SIV vectors (Hansen, S.G. et al. 2009. Nat Med 15:293-299) with a larger trial that
                                                   80

included 4 arms: A) RhCMV/gag,           RhCMV/env, RhCMV/rev/nef/tat,         RhCMV/pol-1,      and
RhCMV pol-2 (wks 0, 14), B) the same RhCMV/SIV vectors (wk 0) followed by pan-proteome
Ad5/SIV vectors (wk 14), C) pan-proteome DNA (wks, 0, 4, 8) followed by pan-proteome Ad5
vectors (wk 14), and D) additional unvaccinated controls. These RM were challenged with same
repeated, limiting dose, intra-rectal SIVmac239 regimen as Applicants'            first study, with
challenge initiated at wk 58. The results of this trial were unprecedented (FIG. 10). Of the 24 RM
that received an RhCMV/SIV vector-containing regimen (Groups A and B), 13 (54%)
manifested initial SIVmac239 infection with a variably sized blip/burst of plasma viremia, which
was followed by immediate control to undetectable levels. None of 9 DNA/Ad5-vaccinated RM
manifested such control, and only 1 of 28 unvaccinated RM manifested an initially occult
infection (which spontaneously reverted to progressive infection at wk 16).                Protected
RhCMV/SIV-vaccinated RM manifested variable numbers of low level viral blips at subsequent
time points (FIG. 10), but overall viral control was sufficiently early and stringent to preclude
any CD4+ target cell depletion (FIG. 11), as well as prevent induction (Group A) or boosting
(Group B) of the anti-SIVenv antibody response (FIG. 12). Importantly, protection in both
RhCMV vector-vaccinated groups significantly correlated with the magnitude of the peak total
SIV-specific CD8+ T cell response in blood during the vaccine phase (FIG. 13), not the
responses present immediately pre-challenge (and not SIV-specific CD4+ T cell responses, not
shown). These peak CD8+ responses in blood likely reflect the degree to which CD8+ TEM are
seeded into systemic effector sites during vaccination. The RhCMV-vectored, SIV-specific T
cell responses were fundamentally different from the responses elicited by DNA/Ad5. The latter
did not provide the immediate protection seen in the RhCMV/SIV vector-vaccinated RM, but did
demonstrate significant mean reductions in peak and early plateau-phase viral loads, and were
associated with strong boosting upon infection (FIG. 14). In contrast, the protection associated
with RhCMV/SIV vectors alone was binary, providing either immediate stringent control, or no
control, and in keeping with this, these responses did not significantly boost in the unprotected
(progressively infected) RM (FIG. 14). The RM given RhCMV/SIV and Ad5/SIV vectors
showed both the immediate    "TEM"  protection, an element of peak and post-peak ("TcM") control,
and a post-infection response boost, similar to, but less than, the DNA/Ad5- vaccinated group
(FIG. 14). 12/13 of RhCMV vector-protected RM              maintained stringent protection for >30
                                                  81

weeks, whereas 7/9 DNA/Ad5-vaccinated RM were indistinguishable from controls by 26 weeks
post-infection.
[00241]      Taken together, these results suggest that RhCMV-vectored SIV-specific T cell
responses intercept mucosally administered SIV infection very early in primary infection, prior
to extensive systemic replication and can maintain stringent control after this early "intercept".
On the other hand, if the virus "wins" the initial battle and extensive, systemic replication ensues,
RhCMV/SIV-vectored TEM responses are unable to "chase" and do not provide peak or post
peak protection. In Applicants' first study (Hansen, S.G. et al. 2009. Nat Med 15:293-299),
Applicants found no evidence of persistent SIV infection in the 4 protected RM, and Applicants
speculated that infection might have been aborted in the colonic mucosa itself. In the follow-up
study, however, Applicants have documented higher initial viral bursts in plasma, and have
found in most protected RM a very low-level persistent infection (manifest by occasional viral
"blips"). Moreover, although cell-associated SIV is either very low or negative in PBMC of most
samples from protected RM (data not shown), Applicants have unequivocally documented SIV
DNA- and RNA-positive CD4+ T cells in the blood of protected RM (those with the highest
initial viral bursts; FIG. 15), establishing that the SIV infection is not wholly contained in the
rectal mucosa after rectal challenge, and protection must, at least in part, be systemic. These data
strongly suggest that there is an early extra-mucosal phase of viral amplification and "broadcast",
which is a likely (additional) point of intercept between RhCMV-vectored, SIV-specific               TEM
responses and the developing SIV infection. In keeping with this, Applicants have found that
RhCMV/SIV vectors indefinitely maintain strikingly high frequencies of SIV-specific T cells in
target cell-rich effector sites that are likely candidates for initial viral infection and amplification,
including both rectal mucosa and sites of potential hematogenous viral spread - spleen, liver,
bone marrow (FIG. 16). Smaller, but substantial frequencies of CMV-vectored, SIV-specific
CD8+ T cells are in mesenteric lymph nodes (LN; FIG. 16), another site of potential viral spread.
Applicants therefore hypothesize that this array of high frequency SIV-specific (CD8+)               TEM
responses constitutes a "shield" against early viral amplification, capable of arresting infection
prior to progressive systemic infection.
[00242]      During the course of evaluation of RhCMV/SIV vector immunogenicity, Applicants
assessed the degree to which the CD8+ T cell responses elicited by these vectors recognized
epitopes that had been previously shown to represent dominant targets in SIV-infected or
                                                    82

DNA/Adenovirus/pox vector-vaccinated RM with the appropriate restricting MHC class I allele.
These epitopes included Mamu A*01-restricted gag-CM9, -LW9, -VL8, -Q19, -VT10, -LF8,
-LA9, env-TL9, and tat-SL8 (12 RM); Mamu A*02-restricted gag-GY9, env-RY8, and nef-YY9
(4 RM); Mamu B*08-restricted nef-RL10 (1 RM), and Mamu B*17-nef-IW9, -MW9, and env
FW9 (7 RM) (41-44). Surprisingly, whether analyzed by tetramer binding or intracellular
cytokine staining (ICS), all these specific epitope responses were negative in RhCMV/SIV
vaccinated RM, despite these RM manifesting robust CFC-defined, CD8+ T cell responses to
total mixes of overlapping, consecutive 15mer peptides for the relevant SIV protein (FIG. 17).
The failure to identify these typical immunodominant CD8+ T cell responses was neither
technical, nor related to individual monkey peculiarities, as subsequent administration of
Ad5/SIV vectors (or progressive SIV infection) in many of these RM was associated with the
appearance for these typical responses (FIG. 17, right panel). These data indicate that
RhCMV/SIV-vectored responses differ from DNA and conventional viral vectors (e.g., Ad5) not
only in their TEM-biased phenotype, function, distribution and longevity, but also in their CD8+
T cell recognition patterns.
[00243]     HCMV encodes 4 related glycoproteins that act together to prevent presentation of
MHC class I-restricted epitopes by infected cells: US2 and US 11 mediate the retrograde
translocation of MHC-I molecules into the cytosol for proteosomal degradation; US3 retains
MHC-1 molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); and US6 inhibits translocation of viral
and host peptides across the ER membrane by the peptide transporter TAT (Powers, C. et al.

E.W. et al. 2001. EMBO J 20:387-396). RhCMV encodes sequence and functional homologues
of these 4 proteins in a genomic region spanning Rh182 (US2) to Rh189 (USI1) (Powers, C.,
and Fruh, K. 2008. Microbiol Immunol 197:109-115 and Pande, N.T. et al. 2005. J Virol
79:5786-5798). To assess the role of these proteins in RhCMV/SIV vector immunobiology
Applicants constructed vectors in which the US2-11 region was specifically deleted (Powers,
C.J., and Fruh, K. 2008. PLoS Pathog 4:e1O00150). US2-11 knock-out (KO) RhCMV vectors
readily infected RhCMV-naive RM (and manifest a virologically and immunologically "normal"
primary infection), but were completely unable to re-infect RhCMV seropositive RM, unless
CD8+ lymphocytes were depleted for at least 2 weeks during vaccination (FIG. 18).
                                               83

Interestingly, in both initially RhCMV-naive RM and CD8-depleted, seropositive RM, the KO
vector infection was indefinitely persistent, even after the appearance (naive) or re-appearance
(CD8-depleted) of RhCMV-specific CD8+ T cell responses. These data indicate a CD8+ cell
mediated checkpoint in re-infection that is bypassed by wt RhCMV via the function of these
class I MHC Ag presentation inhibitory genes. While Applicants expected that loss of US2-11
gene product-mediated "protection" from cytolytic effector T cells would have a virologic
consequence, it was surprising that this consequence only manifested in re-infection, suggesting
that immune evasion by this mechanism may have evolved to allow super-infection, or possibly,
to prevent pre-existent, cross-reactive CD8+ memory T cells (Sylwester, A.W. et al. 2005. J Exp
Med 202:673-685) from interfering with primary infection. Even more surprising, however, was
the effect of US2-11 deletion on CD8+ T cell response induction. In contrast to wt RhCMV/SIV
vectors, the SIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses that developed during 1 infection with the
US2-11     region    KO vectors    prominently  targeted   conventional   Mamu     A*01-restricted
immunodominant SIV epitopes (FIG. 19). The gag-specific CD8+ T cell responses generated by
wt RhCMV/gag were very broadly targeted, spanning all regions of the gag protein, but
manifested     a   lack  of reactivity   with  15mer    peptides   containing   the   conventional
immunodominant epitopes, creating distinct "holes" in the response breadth in Mamu A*01+
RM (FIG. 20). In the gag-specific CD8+ T cell responses elicited by the US2-11 KO
RhCMV/gag vector, these "holes" were filled, and the responses were even more broadly
targeted. These observations have several important implications. First, they indicate that the
lack of conventional      immunodominant epitope recognition in RM vaccinated with wt
RhCMV/SIV vectors is related to the prevention of class I MHC-restricted Ag presentation by
infected cells, strongly suggesting that the CD8+ T cell responses generated by wt RhCMV/SIV
vectors are not derived via Ag-presentation by infected cells, but rather by indirect presentation.
Consistent with this, these results are reminiscent of Applicants' findings with gag protein
adjuvanted with poly I:C or TLR 7/8 ligands, in which Applicants also observed the
development of gag-specific CD8+ T cell responses that lack measureable responses to the
Mamu A*01-restricted gag-CM9 epitope (unpublished observations). However, the RhCMV
vector-elicited CD8+ T cell responses are much stronger and broader than the adjuvanted
protein, suggesting a higher degree of cross-presentation efficiency, perhaps due to dendritic cell
uptake/processing of apoptotic infected cells or CMV dense bodies (Pepperl, S. et al. 2000. J
                                                84

Virol 74:6132-6146). Moreover, the RhCMV vector cross-presentation mechanism is notable for
its apparent complete exclusion         of CD8+     T cell responses to multiple,         conventional
immunodominant epitopes, suggesting the very efficient inhibition of direct presentation and a
distinct epitope processing mechanism for indirect presentation. The second implication of these
data, which is more speculative, but potentially more significant, is the suggestion that
cytotoxicity (direct killing of SIV-infected cells) may not play the primary role in the protection
afforded by wt RhCMV/SIV vector-elicited CD8+ T cell responses. It is not that these cross
presentation-derived responses would lack intrinsic cytotoxic function [the cytotoxic apparatus
of CD8+    TEM   is present (Hansen, S.G. et al. 2009. Nat Med 15:293-299)], but rather that the
epitopes targeted by these responses may not, as a group, be efficiently processed and presented
by infected cells, and therefore might be poor targets for the direct recognition of SIV-infected
cells that is required for cytotoxic T cells to mediate efficient killing [particularly in light of the
ability of nef to also down-regulated MHC 1 molecules (Evans, D.T., and Desrosiers, R.C. 2001.
Immunol Rev 183:141-158]. If this is true, it further follows that the robust protection mediated
by wt RhCMV/SIV vector-elicited responses would most likely be due to a more indirect
effector function (by T cells stimulated by APC in the neighborhood of infected cells), such as,
for example, elaboration of CCR5 binding chemokines (Cocchi, F. et al. 1995. Science
270:1811-1815 and Arenzana-Seisdedos, F., and Parmentier, M. 2006. Semin Immunol 18:387
403). SIV-specific T cell responses elicited by the US2-11 KO RhCMV/SIV vectors clearly
retain the broad epitope recognition that arises from cross-presentation, and maintain the same
phenotypic and functional capabilities of wt vector-elicited responses (not shown), but in
addition, include recognition of the epitopes that are efficiently processed by SIV-infected cells,
and therefore, would include epitopes, like gag CM9 or tat SL8, that can mediate direct
cytotoxicity (Loffredo, J.T. et al. 2007. J Virol 81:2624-2634). Thus, the responses elicited by
US2-11 KO RhCMV/SIV vectors may have enhanced anti-viral function, either by more
efficient cytotoxicity or direct viral suppression, or simply greater CD8+ T cell response breadth,
or both. CD8+ responses elicited by US2-11 deletant vectors might therefore more efficiently
protect RM from progressive SIV infection, increasing the fraction of protected RM above the
current level, a important goal of Applicants' efforts to optimize  TEM  vaccine approaches.
[00244]      Routine T cell response quantification is accomplished by cytokine flow cytometry
(CFC; see FIG. 16) using mixes of overlapping 15 mer peptides for SIVgag, env, pol, and
                                                  85

rev/nef/tat, and RhCMV IE, compared to control peptides (mTB Ag85b and ESAT6) and
co-stimulation alone (Hansen, S.G. et al. 2009. Nat Med 15:293-299). During the vaccine phase
of Group 1, 3 and 4 RM, Applicants routinely follow responses to these overlapping peptide
mixes in PBMC and BAL using CFC tube #1. At necropsy, CFC tube #1 is used on fresh cell
preparations from all individual tissue samples for all SIV proteins to comprehensively establish
the systemic distribution of the SIV-specific T cell responses. CFC tube #s 2 and 3
retrospectively    provide   further functional    characterization  and  phenotypic     assessment
(expression of CD25, HLA-DR, and PD-1) of the degree to which the Ag-specific T cells being
measured were subject to activation in vivo. These additional "tubes" are applied in more limited
fashion, focusing on one (cryopreserved) cell preparation from each tissue and on the dominant
responses identified with the fresh tube #1 analysis. Cryopreserved splenic cells (which are not
limiting) are analyzed with single peptide y-IFN ELISPOT to "deconvolute" overall SIV protein
specific responses into individual 15 mer peptide responses, and then these single peptide
responses are confirmed, lineage typed and functionally characterized with CFC tube #1 from the
same cryopreserved splenic cell preps. Responses to the 5 highest frequency (CD8) epitopes are
analyzed by CFC tube #1 (and selectively tube #s 2 and 3) in all tissues to define the distribution
of these individual epitope responses. Proliferative potential to whole protein peptide mixes and
to the 5 selected individual peptide responses per RM are determined in each tissue by 6 day
CFSE dilution cultures of PBMC and selected tissue cell preps (Onlamoon, N. et al. 2007. J
Med Primatol 36:206-2), and supernatants from these cultures are sampled after 48 hrs and
analyzed for cytokine secretion patterns by Luminex analysis (IL-2, -4, -5, -13, -17, IFN-y, GM
CSF, TNF, MCP-1, MIP-la/p, RANTES) (Giavedoni, L.D. 2005. J Immunol Methods 301:89
101). Viral suppression assays on SIVmac239-infected autologous CD4+ T cells (Vojnov, L. et
al. 2009. J Virol.) are performed on selected cell preparations to compare the anti-viral activity of
responses in different tissues and arising from different vaccination routes. As demonstrated
above, the CD8+ T cell responses elicited by wt RhCMV/SIV vectors do not include the typical
immunodominant epitopes defined for SIV or other viral vectors, precluding the use of existing
tetramers to analyze wt RhCMV/SIV vector-elicited responses. However, as part of this Example
and other ongoing work, Applicants can identify and determine the restricting MHC allele on
common, dominant CMV/SIV vector-elicited epitopes and have tetramers constructed for the
most common of these epitopes. As they become available, these tetramers (as well as existing
                                                 86

tetramers for "typical" epitopes in RM likely to have such responses -- DNA/Ad5-vaccinated
and/or SIV-infected), are applied to this Example in appropriate RM (e.g., correct MHC types),
both to directly quantify and phenotypically characterize tetramer defined responses in PBMC
and tissues by flow cytometry, but more importantly, for sorting of defined epitope-specific
populations by microarray analysis (see below). Ab responses to gag and env are quantified in
plasma and rectal washings by ELISA (Lu, X. et al. 1998. AIDS 12:1-10), with samples
exhibiting env titres >1:100 analyzed for neutralization of SIVmac239 and tissue culture-adapted
SIVmac251 (Montefiori, D.C. 2005. Curr Protoc Immunol Chapter 12:Unit 12 11).
[00245]     Wildtype (wt) RhCMV/SIV vectors elicit high frequency and broadly targeted CD8+
TEM responses to SIV epitopes, yet do not include responses to the typical immunodominant
epitopes targeted in SIV infection itself or after vaccination with DNA or conventional viral
vectors. Applicants have further shown that this "hole" in the wt RhCMV/SIV vector-elicited
CD8+ T cell targeting is a direct result of the action of CMV genes in the US2-11 region that
prevent MHC class I-restricted presentation by infected cells, a mechanism that might serve
CMV biology by directing CD8+ T cell responses away from epitopes most likely to allow for
efficient direct CD8+ T cell recognition of CMV-infected cells, and therefore, efficient CD8+ T
cell-mediated cytolysis. From an HIV/SIV vaccine perspective, this remarkable biology has
several highly significant implications, including the possibility that the robust, but incomplete,
protection elicited by wt RhCMV/SIV vectors might be enhanced by extending CD8+ T cell
targeting to epitopes that are more efficiently processed and presented by SIV-infected cells. The
addition of CD8+ T cell responses that recognize such epitopes might improve vaccine efficacy
by increasing the efficiency of direct CD8+ T cell recognition of SIV-infected cells, allowing for
more effective cytolysis or more accurately directed (proximate) non-cytolytic              effector
mechanisms (compared to indirectly presented epitopes by nearby uninfected cells). To
Applicants' knowledge, the ability to turn "off' and "on" a specific CD8+ T cell recognition
pattern by simple modification of a viral vaccine vector is unprecedented, certainly in the SIV
vaccine model, and offers a unique opportunity to define the impact of the pattern of CD8+
recognition on the ability of vaccine-elicited CD8+ T cell responses to suppress and perhaps
even clear primary SIV infection. Such information would clearly extend Applicants'
understanding of immunologic requirements for CD8+ T cell-mediated protection in the SIV
model, but would also have a major impact on the translation pathway of CMV vectors into a
                                                  87

human HIV/AIDS vaccine candidate. The finding of enhanced efficacy of US2-11 deletant
vectors would provide a strong impetus to take advantage of this superior protection, either by
steering CMV vector development towards constructs with this deletion and therefore targeted
towards CMV-naive populations (pediatric populations, almost certainly with additional vector
modifications to increase safety) or by the development of constructs which can present
"internally processed" epitopes, yet retain the ability to re-infect CMV-seropositive individuals
(perhaps by more limited -- sub-region or specific gene -- deletions in the US2-1 1 region).
Example 3: A Systematic Evaluation of Cytomegalovirus Vaccine Efficacy
[00246]     Although human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes a mostly benign, unnoticed
persistent   infection    in  immunocompetent        individuals,   it   can    cause  disease  in
immunocompromised individuals such as transplant or AIDS patients. HCMV is also the most
frequent infectious cause of birth defects, with an estimated 0.7% of babies in the APPLICANTS
being born with congenital infection, and approximately 10% of these infections resulting in
long-term sequelae (primarily sensorineural defects) (Dollard, S. C. et al. 2007. Rev Med Virol
17:355-63). The annual health costs to care for these children is estimated to be about $1-2
billion (Cannon, M. J., and K. F. Davis. 2005. BMC Public Health 5:70). For these reasons, the
development of a CMV vaccine has been given high priority by the Institute of Medicine and the
National Vaccine Advisory Committee (Arvin, A. M. et al. 2004. Clin Infect Dis 39:233-9).
However, the development of a vaccine has been frustratingly slow despite efforts for more than
30 years (Dekker, C. L., and A. M. Arvin. 2009. N Engl J Med 360:1250-2.). A major, if not the
major, road-block for CMV vaccine development is the fact that immunity from natural infection
or vaccination offers only very limited, if any, protection against re-infection by CMV (Adler, S.
P. et al. 1995. J Infect Dis 171:26-32 and Boppana, S. B. et al. 2001. N Engl J Med 344:1366
71). This unique characteristic of CMV that prevents 'protection from infection' being used as a
read-out for vaccine efficacy has rendered it very difficult to evaluate candidate CMV vaccines,
with current measures relying primarily on more subjective criteria such as reduction in disease
symptoms (Gonczol, E., and S. Plotkin. 2001. Expert Opin Biol Ther 1:401-12). The mechanism
by which CMV achieves this unique ability to re-infect in the presence of pre-existing immunity
has not been understood until recently. Using the rhesus macaque (RM) model, Applicants' team
demonstrated that rhesus CMV (RhCMV) can repeatedly re-infect sero-positive animals even
when the same strain of CMV is used and an high level of antibody and T cell immunity is
                                                  88

present (Hansen, S. G. et al. 2009. Nat Med 15:293-9 and Price, D. A. et al.. 2008. J Immunol
180:269-). In preliminary experiments Applicants further show that such re-infection occurs with
as little as 100 plaque-forming units (PFU) given subcutaneously (s.c.). Remarkably, re-infection
of sero-positive animals is prevented when Applicants use a RhCMV recombinant (designated
ARh182-9) that has lost its ability to prevent antigen presentation by major histocompatibility
complex class I (MHC-I) due to deletion of the RhCMV homologues of the US6 family of
HCMV immunevasins, US2-US 11. Depletion of CD8* T cells restores the ability of ARh182-9
to re-infect sero-positive RMs, showing that inhibition of antigen presentation is one of the
underlying reasons for re-infection.
[00247]      Importantly, the capacity of immunity induced by natural CMV infection to protect
against the US2-11 deleted virus ARhl82-9 is thus an excellent measure for the quality of the
CD8+ T cell response against CMV induced naturally by prior infection or artificially by
vaccination. This measure far surpasses all other means currently available to monitor CMV
vaccine efficacy, since it is effectively 'all-or-none': once the sites of persistence have been
reached by ARh182-9 (even by a few viruses) long-term infection and easily detectable levels of
viral shedding occur. In contrast, other measures such as viremia and clinical signs of infection
are notoriously variable, subjective, and are especially problematic where vaccine effects are
rather subtle. Applicants therefore propose to use protection against ARhI82-9 to systematically
re-evaluate some of the basic assumptions regarding vaccine approaches that have been made
over the years regarding CMV vaccines. This allows Applicants to develop empirically based
recommendations for the best strategy to develop a vaccine against HCMV. To accelerate future
development of HCMV-based vaccines Applicants also generate and characterize in vitro
recombinant HCMVs containing the same attenuating genetic disruptions present in the
attenuated RhCMV vaccines.
[00248]      Applicants' recent findings using a RhCMV virus deleted for the US2-11 genes
(ARhl 82-9) show that this family of immune evasion genes is responsible for the ability of CMV
to re-infect the healthy sero-positive host. Applicants'     subsequent observation that CD8+
depletion prior to challenge overcomes the block to ARh182-9 infection in CMV sero-positive
animals shows that the US6 family proteins function by their effect on the CMV-specific CD8+ T
cell response. Thus, ARhI82-9 infection can serve as an all-or-none read-out for whether a
                                                 89

CMV-specific CD8+ T cell immune response is functionally comparable to that induced by
natural WT CMV infection.
[00249]      CMV possesses the remarkable ability to re-infect and establish a persistent infection
regardless of host CMV immunity (Boppana, S. B. et al. 1999. Pediatrics 104:55-60, Farroway,
L. N. et al. 2005. Epidemiol Infect 133:701-10 and Hansen, S. G. et al. 2009. Nat Med 15:293-9)
(FIG. 31). After initial infection, CMV is shed for years from epithelial surfaces into body fluids
(saliva, tears, urine, genital secretions and breast milk), and transmission generally involves
mucosal exposure to such fluids, most commonly in early childhood or adolescence (Boppana, S.
B. et al. 1999. Pediatrics 104:55-60 and Pass, R. F. 2001. Cytomegalovirus, p. 2675-2705. In P.
M. H. David M. Knipe, Diane E. Griffin, Robert A. Lamb Malcolm A. Martin, Bernard Roizman
and Stephen E. Straus (ed.), Fields Virology, 4th ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins,
Philadelphia). In humans, the inability of natural HCMV immunity to protect against re-infection
was initially demonstrated in an early human vaccine trial, wherein re-infection using low doses
of a replicating HCMV strain, Toledo-1, was observed in healthy HCMV sero-positives (Plotkin,
S. A. et al. 1989. J Infect Dis 159:860-5 and Quinnan, G. V. et al. 1984. Ann Intern Med
101:478-83). Evidence for re-infection and virus persistence was observed by virus isolation
from one individual (10 pfu group), and induction of an amnestic anti-HCMV antibody response
in a second individual (100 pfu group) - although no individuals receiving doses of either 10
(n=2), or 100 pfu (n=5) showed any HCMV-associated symptoms. All individuals in a third
sero-positive group that received 1,000 pfu of Toledo-i (n=5) showed evidence of infection,
comprised of an amnestic HCMV-specific antibody and T cell response. Virus was also detected
in throat swabs and urine from one symptomatically infected individual, and in the blood from a
second asymptomatic individual. Toledo-i was administered via a parenteral (subcutaneous)
route, and it is possible that protection against natural infection via mucosal routes may by
impacted by HCMV immunity (Adler, S. P. et al. 1995. J Infect Dis 171:26-32). However, a
study performed in a cohort of 46 HCMV sero-positive pregnant women using CMV strain
specific antibodies as an indicator of re-infection suggests that natural HCMV re-infection of the
sero-positive healthy adult is a common occurrence (Boppana, S. B. et al. 2001. N Engl J Med
344:1366-71).
[00250]      In contrast to the limited effect of HCMV-induced immunity on preventing re
infection, maternal HCMV immunity reduces both transmission of HCMV to the fetus (Fowler,
                                                  90

K. B. et al. 2003. JAMA 289:1008-11), as well as the occurrence of disease following infection
in congenitally-infected infants (Fowler, K. B. et al. 1992. N Engl J Med 326:663-7 and Ross, S.
A. et al. 2006. J Pediatr 148:332-6). In an initial study by Fowler et al (Fowler, K. B. et al. 2003.
JAMA 289:1008-11), maternal HCMV sero-positivity corresponded to a 70% reduction in the
risk of congenital HCMV infection. A more recent exhaustive meta-analysis, analyzing results
from epidemiologic studies published between 1966 and 2006 showed the rate of congenital
HCMV transmission to be 1.4% compared to 32% in HCMV sero-positive and sero-negative
mothers, respectively (Keenan, R. J. et al. 1991. Transplantation 51:433-8). The impact of
maternal HCMV sero-status on disease outcome of congenital infection has not been as
thoroughly explored. However, the existing evidence suggests that maternal HCMV sero
positivity reduces the severity of congenital disease (Fowler, K. B. et al. 1992. N Engl J Med
326:663-7 and Ross, S. A. et al. 2006. J Pediatr 148:332-6). In one study, the incidence of
symptomatic disease was 25% compared to 8% in congenitally infected infants from primary and
recurrently infected mothers, respectively (Fowler, K. B. et al. 1992. N Engl J Med 326:663-7).
In a second study, although the frequency of hearing loss was comparable in congenitally
infected infants following primary or recurrent infection, the severity of the hearing deficit was
greater in congenitally infected infants following maternal primary infection (Ross, S. A. et al.
2006. J Pediatr 148:332-6). Both humoral and cellular CMV-specific responses appear to play a
role in reducing transmission (for review, see (Adler, S. P. 2008. J Clin Virol 41:231-6)). This
importance of CMV-specific T cell responses is most clearly shown by the increased incidence
of CMV transmission to the fetus in mothers with T cell deficiency from AIDS (Adler, S. P.
2008. J Clin Virol 41:231-6 and Doyle, M. et al. 1996. Pediatr Infect Dis J 15:1102-6). Together,
these studies suggest that a realistic goal of an HCMV vaccine is to reduce the incidence and
severity of congenital CMV disease.
[00251]     The poor efficacy of any vaccine approach tested to date is consistent with the
inability of natural CMV immunity to protect from re-infection. The greatest level of protection
for any HCMV human vaccine trial was recently observed using a recombinantly-expressed
HCMV envelope gB with MF59 adjuvant-based approach in a placebo-controlled clinical trial
(Pass, R. F. et al. 2009. N Engl J Med 360:1191-9). However, the difference in protection
between vaccinees and saline controls was less than two-fold (7.7% compared to 13.5% in saline
control group), was not robust as incorrect assignment of a small number of subjects could have
                                                  91

eliminated statistical significance, and although a trend towards an effect on congenital infection
was suggested (1 case of congenital infection, compared to 3 cases in saline control group; note
after study stopped 2 additional congenital infections in saline group), this difference was not
statistically significant. Based on the level of protection afforded in this study, it was estimated
that a study adopting symptomatic congenital infection as an endpoint would require enrollment
of >50,000 women (Dekker, C. L., and A. M. Arvin. 2009. N Engl J Med 360:1250-2). The lack
of any statistically significant immune correlate with protection of the fetus, and the necessarily
rigorous safety restrictions of vaccine trials performed in women of reproductive age are further
concerns that are essentially prohibitive to any thorough analysis of HCMV vaccine candidates
designed to interrupt maternal to fetal transmission of CMV.
[00252]      In summary, although immunity induced by natural WT CMV infection is unable to
protect against re-infection, it does afford a significant level of protection against congenital
infection and severity of disease. This observation would suggest that a vaccine that can safely
induce a level of immunity comparable to that induced by WT CMV infection may have a
significant impact on congenital infection. The necessarily strict safety restrictions for analysis of
candidate CMV vaccines in this target population (ie., CMV sero-negative women of child
bearing age, and sero-negative pregnant women), pose significant problems for vaccine
development, and probably preclude the use of any approach but a fully replication-defective
based strategy. This limitation of human vaccine trials leaves unanswered the critical question of
what level of vaccine attenuation can be achieved whilst still inducing a level of immunity
comparable to that acquired through natural CMV infection (ie., an immunity that can decrease
congenital infection). Currently, a non-human primate model to study CMV maternal to fetal
transmission does not exist, and the genetically divergent rodent models do not completely
translate to human HCMV infection. In this Example, Applicants propose that use of a dual
challenge strategy combining a) the all-or-none read-out of ARhI82-9 challenge, with b) the
continuous variable of viremia following WT-RhCMV s.c. challenge, are able to determine the
minimal requirements for induction of a CMV-specific immunity that functionally recapitulates
immunity induced by WT CMV infection. The biochemical comparison for these attenuated
RhCMVs in parallel with their HCMV counterparts containing the identical genetic lesion ensure
that any attenuated RhCMV showing protection can be translated into the HCMV 'strain of
                                                  92

choice' with the confidence that the genetic deletion results in an HCMV vaccine with a
comparable biochemical phenotype.
[00253]     There is ample evidence that re-infection occurs in HCMV (Boppana, S. B. et al.
2001. N Engl J Med 344:1366-71 and Ross, S. A. et al. 2006. J Pediatr 148:332-6). In the RM
model Applicants previously showed that CMV-positive RMs could be repeatedly re-infected
with 107 plaque forming units (PFU) of recombinant RhCMV (Hansen, S. G. et al. 2009. Nat
Med 15:293-9). Each re-infection was detected as a boost in the anti-CMV T cell response and
by the development of a de novo response to a new SIV antigen marker present only in the re
infecting virus. To determine whether re-infection also occurs at lower doses of RhCMV,
Applicants infected sero-positive RMs with decreasing titers of RhCMV expressing SIV Gag
(RhCMV-Gag). Re-infection was followed immunologically by measuring SIV Gag-specific T
cell responses (Hansen, S. G. et al. 2009. Nat Med 15:293-9). When sero-positive animals were
inoculated s.c. with 104 or 102 PFU of RhCMV-Gag a significant Gag-specific T cell response
was observed at 14 days post-infection (p.i.) (FIG. 31). This Gag-specific response remained
detectable for the duration of the experiment. Based on Applicants' experience in comparable
studies, Gag responses are detectable for the life of the animal (>7 years p.i.) indicating a long
term persistent infection.
[00254]     To determine whether Gag-expressing virus was shed by infected animals, Applicants
sampled saliva and urine on a weekly basis. Upon co-culturing virus pellets with RM fibroblasts
(RFs), Applicants monitored Gag expression in immunoblots. In animals that received 107 PFU
of RhCMV-Gag, Applicants detected Gag-positive virus in the urine of some animals within 7
14 days p.i., and in all animals by 42 days p.i.. Similarly, buccal swabs of all animals were
positive by 70 days p.i.. Animals inoculated with lower doses had a trend toward longer time p.i.
before detection of RhCMV-Gag in saliva and urine, but all animals were eventually positive.
Consistent with previous published studies for HCMV (Plotkin, S. A. et al. 1989. J Infect Dis
159:860-5 and Quinnan, G. V. et al. 1984. Ann Intern Med 101:478-83), these data show that
prior infection by RhCMV does not protect against re-infection, even at CMV doses as low as
100 PFU. These results also indicate that the de novo immune response against a foreign antigen
is a more sensitive and reproducible indicator of CMV re-infection than the detection of virus in
the secretions.
                                                93

[00255]     The ease with which RhCMV overcomes a substantial, pre-existing anti-CMV
immune response during re-infection suggests that CMV has evolved mechanisms to evade host
immune surveillance. The adaptive cellular immune response is known to be particularly
important for controlling CMV. In humans, CMV-specific T cells comprise on average
approximately 10% of both the CD4+ and CD8+ memory compartments (Sylwester, A. W. et al.
2005. J Exp Med 202:673-85) suggesting that enormous resources are constantly devoted to
controlling this virus. Applicants hypothesized that a key aspect of re-infection might be the
ability of CMV to escape T cell detection. All CMVs are known to encode multiple proteins that
prevent antigen presentation by MHC-I, thus limiting the ability of CD8+ T cells to recognize
and eliminate CMV-infected cells (Loenen, W. A. et al. 2001. Semin Immunol 13:41-9).
Applicants previously demonstrated that the RhCMV genomic region Rh182-Rh189 encodes
functional homologues of the US2, US3, US6 and US 11 immunevasins of HCMV (Pande, N. T.
et al. 2005. J Virol 79:5786-98). To determine whether these viral inhibitors of antigen
presentation were required for re-infection, Applicants replaced the Rh182-189 region with an
expression cassette for the SIV Gag antigen, which allowed Applicants to monitor Gag-specific
immune responses in infected animals (virus designated ARhl82-9Gag). Deletion of the Rhl82
9 region was confirmed by PCR and Southern Blot. Applicants further monitored in vitro growth
in primary RFs and observed no difference to WT, BAC-derived RhCMV (data not shown).
Initially, Applicants determined whether ARh182-9Gag would be able to establish persistent
infection in CMV-negative animals. Applicants infected two sero-negative animals with 5x 106
PFU of ARh182-9Gag and two control animals with the RhCMV-Gag (Hansen, S. G. et al. 2009.
Nat Med 15:293-9.). Infection was monitored immunologically by the development of a CMV
specific and SIV Gag-specific immune responses and virologically by viral shedding of Gag
marked viruses into the urine and saliva. As shown in FIG. 32, a Gag-specific T cell response to
ARh1 82-9Gag was detectable with similar kinetics and magnitude as responses against RhCMV
Gag. Moreover, ARhI 82-9Gag (confirmed by immunoblot) was detected in the secretions of the
infected animals even >1 year p.i. (data not shown). Therefore, Applicants conclude that
ARhI 82-9Gag is competent to establish persistent infection in CMV-naive animals.
[00256]     To determine whether ARh1 82-9Gag would be able to re-infect sero-positive animals
Applicants inoculated CMV      RMs s.c. with 107 PFU. Consistent with Applicants' previous
observations, the WT control RhCMV-Gag re-infected all four animals as evidenced by
                                               94

detection of SIV Gag-specific T cell responses in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (FIG. 33A). In contrast, none of the four animals infected with
ARh1 82-9Gag displayed any detectable signs of re-infection either by T cell assay (FIG. 33B) or
by monitoring secretions for virus (data not shown). This lack of re-infection was not due to
these animals being refractory to re-infection as the same animals could be re-infected with
ARh178Gag, a virus that lacks a RhCMV-specific MHC-I evasion gene that has no HCMV
counterpart (Powers, C. J., and K. Fruh. 2008. PLoS Pathog 4:e1000150) (FIG. 33C). Together,
these experiments suggest that inhibition of antigen presentation by the US6 family (US2-11
genes) of immunomodulators is essential for RhCMV re-infection of the sero-positive host.
[00257]     Since ARhI82-9Gag was able to infect CMV-naive animals, but not CMV-positive
animals, Applicants hypothesized that the CMV-specific immune response, and particularly the
CD8+ T cell response, prevented re-infection by the "immunologically defenseless" ARh182
9Gag virus. To test this hypothesis Applicants immuno-depleted CD8+ T cells from sero-positive
RMs prior to re-infection with ARhI82-9Gag. Serial injections of antibody cM-T807 (Schmitz, J.
E. et al. 1999. Science 283:857-60) temporarily reduced CD8+ T cells for the duration of
approximately 2-3 weeks (FIG. 34A). All four CMV-positive, immuno-depleted animals were
re-infected by ARhl82-9Gag as shown by SIV Gag-specific CD4+ T cell responses which were
observed at 7 days p.i. (FIG. 34B). Interestingly, the animals even generated Gag-specific CD8+
T cell responses when CD8+ levels rebounded. Moreover, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were
detectable for the remainder of the experiment suggesting that a persistent infection had been
established. Applicants are currently examining secretions by co-culture for presence of
ARhI 82-9Gag. Applicants conclude that CMV-encoded immunevasins enable re-infection of the
sero-positive host due to their ability to evade the host CMV-specific CD8+ T response.
However, immunity induced by natural CMV infection is able to protect against CMV re
infection in the absence of these virally encoded immunevasins.
[00258]     For the first time, Applicants' data establish a clear causal relationship between viral
immune modulation (by immunevasins) and the unique ability of CMV to re-infect the sero
positive host. Given the close evolutionary relationship between the humans and RMs, as well as
the functional conservation of US2, 3, 6 and 11 between HCMV and RhCMV, Applicants
consider it highly likely that the ability of HCMV to re-infect humans is also mediated by
inhibitors of antigen presentation. These observations also have another implication that is highly
                                                 95

relevant to the goal of vaccine development. Specifically, this is the first time that CMV-specific
immunity in a primate species has been shown to completely prevent re-infection by CMV, even
at a very high doses of challenge virus. Applicants therefore conclude that protection against
ARhI82-9 is an all-or-none measure for the quality of the pre-existing CMV specific immune
response.
[00259]     Thus, challenge with ARhl82-9Gag can be used to determine whether any type of
vaccination effort has successfully generated a CD8+ T cell response that is as protective as that
induced by natural infection. Applicants anticipate that this assay is far superior to any other
measure of CMV-vaccine efficacy, since this all-or-nothing read-out allows candidate vaccine
efficacy to be determined using relatively small groups of animals. Using ARhl82-9Gag
challenge,   Applicants   re-examine whether non-replicating,        partially replicating   or non
replicating heterologous 'prime-boost' vaccines are able to induce a protective response.
[00260]     Given the clear demonstration that HCMV re-infection of the fully immune host can
efficiently occur even at low doses of virus, it seems that complete prevention of infection in
vaccinees is likely not realistically an achievable goal. However, substantial epidemiological
data shows that CMV immunity afforded by natural CMV infection significantly decreases
maternal to fetal transmission of CMV. Thus, a reasonable and achievable goal for a CMV
vaccine is to develop a vaccine that mimics immunity induced by primary infection, and thereby
reduces transmission of CMV from the mother to the fetus (Adler, S. P. et al. 1995. J Infect Dis
171:26-32). Such a vaccine has to be extremely safe since the target population includes
pregnant women. Finding an optimal balance between safety and efficacy has been a major
obstacle in CMV vaccine development. This is, in large part, because the unique ability of CMV
to re-infect CMV-immune individuals renders it difficult, if not impossible, to use protection
from infection as a final read-out (at least in closely related primate models). For this reason, a
major unsolved question is at what level of attenuation a vaccine still induces a level of
immunity comparable to natural CMV infection, and thereby achieve the maximal level of
"protective" efficacy realistically achievable. Applicants' goal is to address this critical question,
and determine the level of attenuation of CMV at which an immune response equivalent to
natural immunity is still generated. Applicants address this question in the RhCMV/RM infection
model - a model that closely mimics HCMV infection in humans, but that permits empirical
'fine-tuning' of the level of CMV attenuation. In the first approach, Applicants address the
                                                 96

question of whether replication-deficient CMV-based vaccines, either single- or low-cycle, are
sufficient to induce a CMV-specific immune response and, following the induction of an
immune response, what are the characteristics of immunity, regarding duration, magnitude and T
cell phenotype. In a separate approach, Applicants introduce an on/off switch into the RhCMV
genome which allow Applicants to inhibit or re-start viral replication at any time after infection
thus addressing the roles of initial virus dissemination to sites of latent/persistent infection in the
host, as well as of acute versus persistent replication in inducing a CMV-specific immune
response. To overcome the problem in measuring efficacy of the immune response induced by
the various attenuation strategies, Applicants propose to use the ability of a vaccine to protect
against the US2-11 deleted recombinant virus ARhI829Gag. In addition to the attenuated
vaccines, Applicants also evaluate the ability of 'Prime-Boost' vaccines (IE-1, pp65b, gB) to
prevent ARhl82-9Gag re-infection using a DNA prime/adenovirus boost strategy. Vaccinated
animals that were protected against ARh182-9Gag are further challenged with WT-RhCMV
followed by monitoring of viremia. Applicants anticipate that this dual-challenge strategy show
that protection against re-infection with ARhl 82-9Gag correlates with the ability of a vaccine to
reduce WT-RhCMV viremia, a much more difficult to monitor and variable read-out currently
used to evaluate vaccine efficacy. Protection against ARhl82-9Gag thus indicate that a given
vaccine was able to generate a CMV-specific immune response, particularly a CD8+ T cell
response, similar to that induced during natural infection. One of the great advantages of the
RhCMV model is the close evolutionary relationship between the human and rhesus CMVs, and
their respective hosts. Therefore, Applicants in parallel generate and characterize HCMV-derived
constructs containing identical genetic deletions thereby ensuring that any of the attenuated
vaccines that shows promise in the RhCMV system is functionally comparable to its HCMV
counterpart. Applicants anticipate that results obtained in this project are directly transferable to
development of an HCMV-based vaccine candidate.
Example 4: A US2-1]-Deleted Virus Can be Used as a Testing Devicefor CMV-Vaccine Efficacy
[00261]     Applicants have infected rhesus macaques with RhCMV lacking the gene Rh1 10 that
encodes for the viral transactivator pp71. RhCMVARh 110 is growth-deficient in vitro but is not
secreted from infected monkeys. Applicants have tested whether monkeys infected with
RhCMVARhI10 are protected against challenge with RhCMVAUS2-11                     expressing the SIV
antigen Gag. Protection was demonstrated by the absence of a boost in RhCMV-specific T cell
                                                 97

responses . In contrast, monkeys infected with wildtype-virus show a boost of the CMV-specific
T cell response (see FIG. 23). This result indicates that spread-deficient CMV is capable of
inducing a T cell response that protects against challenge with US2-1 1 deleted virus. This result
also indicates that a US2-11 deleted virus can be used to monitor the efficacy of the T cell
response.
[00262]     In a similar experiment Applicants created a RhCMV lacking the tegument proteins
pp65a and pp65b encoded by the genes Rh 111 and Rh1 12, respectively (see FIG. 24). These
proteins are not required for viral growth in vitro. However, pp65 is an immunodominant protein
that is included in current formulations of subunit vaccines for CMV developed by various
investigators. To examine whether pp65-specific T cells are required for protection against
challenge with AUS2-1 1, Applicants infected rhesus macaques with RhCMVARhI 11-112. As
expected Applicants observed an immune response against the IE-proteins of CMV , but not
against pp65. In contrast, a pp65-specific T cell response was readily detected in animals
infected with RhCMV (blue line). Applicants also observed that RhCMVARhI 11-112 is secreted
from infected animals.
