      AN OPEN REFRIGERATED DISPLAY CASE AND A FLOW STABILISING DEVICE
    The invention relates to an open refrigerated display case and a flow stabilising device
    for an open refrigerated display case.
 5
    The display of chilled or frozen items is commonplace in many retail environments,
    most notably in supermarkets.       Conventionally, such items have been displayed in
     refrigerated display cases having glass doors to allow customers to browse items
    before opening the doors to access the items. However, the presence of such doors
10  has been seen as problematic in that they make it difficult for several customers to
    access the contents of the case, as well as providing an obstruction when open,
     narrowing the usable aisle space.
     It is therefore common for supermarkets to use open-fronted display cases (Open
15   Refrigerated Display Cases; herein "ORDCs"). ORDCs utilise an air curtain which is
    cooled to below ambient temperature and propelled downward, across the open front
    of the display case. The air curtain separates the refrigerated interior of the display
    case from the ambient air surrounding the display case. The air curtain thus keeps the
    cool air inside the display case from spilling out due to buoyancy effects, and also
20  provides a barrier from other external motions of air around the display case. ORDCs
    therefore do not need any physical barrier separating customers from the contents of
    the display case. Accordingly, ORDCs provide a desirable method of displaying food
    and other perishable goods as they allow both easy access and clear visibility of
     merchandise.
25
     However, as a direct consequence of their open design, ORDCs do have significantly
    higher energy consumption compared to the closed-fronted alternative. The main
    energy losses occur within the air curtain, and are caused by the entrainment of warm
    ambient air into the air curtain and the turbulent mixing which occurs within the air
30  curtain itself. The entrainment of warm ambient air causes an increase in temperature
    within the air curtain, and this warmer air must be cooled as it re-circulates through the
    system. It has been estimated that 70% to 80% of the cooling load of an ORDC is due
    to such effects.

                                                 2
   in recent years, multi-decked designs have become commonplace to maximise the
   display space per unit of floor space. Consequently, the air curtains of such ORDCs
   must seal a larger display area. This has exacerbated entrainment issues and the
   resulting energy losses, as well as making the design of air curtains more challenging,
 5 particularly in respect of ensuring product integrity and temperature homogeneity while
   attempting to minimize their energy consumption.
   The invention thus seeks to improve the efficiency of ORDCs by reducing entrainment
   within the air curtain.
10
   According to an aspect of the invention there is therefore provided an open refrigerated
   display case comprising: a refrigerated display area comprising, one or more shelves;
   an air outlet and an air inlet opening into the' display area and spaced from one
   another; a duct fluidically coupling the air inlet to the air outlet, the duct being
15 configured to direct air flow out of the air outlet across the display area and toward the
   air inlet to form an air curtain across the display area; wherein each of the one or more
   shelves are provided with an associated flow stabilising device; wherein the one or
   more flow stabilising devices each comprise a cellular structure which extends
   transversely across the display area perpendicular to the direction of the air flow within
20 the air curtain, the cellular structure forming a matrix of stabilising channels; wherein
   the one or more flow stabilising devices are each positioned so that the stabilising
   channels receive the entire air curtain and stabilise the air flow within the air curtain;
   wherein an upper surface of the or each flow stabilising device is arranged so as to be
   substantially level with or below an upper surface of the associated shelf.
25
   The cellular structure is a honeycomb structure.
   The flow stabilising devices may be spaced from the air outlet and/or one another by a
   distance which corresponds to approximately 4 to 6 times a width of the air outlet.
30
   The flow stabilising devices may be spaced by a distance which corresponds to
   approximately 5 times a width of the air outlet.
    Each flow stabilising device may be connected to the one or more shelves.

    Each flow stabilising device may be pivotably connected to the one or more shelves.
    Each flow stabilising device may beconfigured so as to allow a position of the matrix of
    stabilising channels relative to the-shelf to be varied.
 5
    Each flow stabilising device may be lhtegraly forming in one of the shelves.
    The stabilising channels may each have a uniform cross-sectioh along their length (i e
    they are parallel-sided).

    Figure 7 is a side cross-sectional view of an ORDC according to another embodiment
    of the invention having a plurality of shelves with flow stabilising devices as shown in
20  Figure 6.
    Figure 1 shows a conventional ORDC 2. The ORDC 2 comprises a cabinet portion
    formed by a lower wall 4, a back wall 6, an upper wall 8, and left and right side walls
    (not shown). A lower panel 10, a back panel 12 and an upper panel 14 are disposed
25  within the cabinet portion.
    The lower, back and upper panels 10, 12, 14 form a display area 15 which is provided
    with a plurality of shelves 17 (six are shown) on which items may be displayed. The
    shelves 17 are affixed to the back panel 12.
30
    As shown, the lower, back and upper panels 10, 12, 14 are spaced from the respective
    lower, back and upper walls 4, 6, 8 to form a duct 16. An intake grille 18 is provided at
    the lower panel 10 to form an inlet to the duct 16. Similarly, a discharge grille 20 is
    provided at the upper panel 14 to form an outlet from the duct 16. The intake grille 18
35  and the discharge grille 20 are thus fluidically coupled to one another by the duct 16.

   WO 2015/198076                                                          PCT/GB2015/051891
                                                   5
    The intake grille 18 and the discharge grille 20 are spaced from the back panel 12
    toward the front of the cabinet portion and ahead of the shelves 17.
    A fan 22 and a heat exchanger 24 are located within the duct 16 adjacent to the intake
 5  grille 18 and thus are disposed between the lower wall 4 and the lower panel 10. The
    fan 22 draws air into the duct 16 via the intake grille 18 which then passes through the
    heat exchanger 24 where it is cooled to well below the ambient temperature.
    After passing through the heat exchanger 24, the air continues through the duct 16
10  between the back wall 6 and the back panel 12. The back panel 12 is perforated
    allowing air to pass from the duct 16 into the display area 15 where it cools items
    located on the shelves 17 and on the lower panel 10.
    The remaining air flows through the duct 16 to the discharge grille 20.          The air is
15  ejected from the discharge grille 20 and descends over the open front of the display
    area 15 to form an air curtain 26. The air curtain 26 passes from the discharge grille 20
    to the intake grille 18, where it is drawn in by the fan 22 and re-circuiated through the
    duct 16. The air curtain 26 thus forms a non-physical barrier which separates the
    display area 15 from the ambient air surrounding the ORDC 2.
20
    As shown in Figure 1, the air curtain 26 may be angled away from vertical by around 5
     10*.   This may be achieved by angling the discharge grille 20.          In particular, the
    discharge grille 20 may be provided with a honeycomb panel (not shown) which
    rectifies the air flow as it exits the discharge grille 20 to provide laminar flow. The air
25  curtain 26 may also deviate away from the back panel 12 as a result of the air passing
    through the perforations in the back panel 12. The intake grille 18 is therefore offset
    from the discharge grille 20 to allow for this.
    Figure 2 shows a flow stabilising device 28 according to an embodiment of the
30  invention which is fitted to one of the shelves 17 of the ORDC 2.
    As shown in Figure 2, each shelf 17 comprises a shelf portion 30 and a pair of brackets
    32 which support the shelf portion 30 and are configured to be received within slots in
    the back panel 12 of the ORDC 2. A product information strip 34 extends across a

   WO 2015/198076                                                       PCT/GB2015/051891

    front surface of the shelf portion 30 and has a channel for receiving tickets displaying
    information regarding the products on the shelf portion 30, such as the product's price.
    The flow stabilising device 28 comprises a pair of arms 36a, 36b. The arms 36a, 36b
 5  are affixed to either lateral side of the shelf 17 such that they are spaced from one
    another across the width of the shelf 17. Each of the arms 36a, 36b is connected at
    one end to the shelf 17 and extends away from the shelf 17 in a cantilevered manner to
    a free end. The arms 36a, 36b thus lie in the same plane as the shelf 17. The arms
    36a, 36b may be connected to the shelf 17 in any suitable manner, such as via
10  attachment to the shelf portion 30, the brackets 32 or the product information strip 34.
    A pair of stabilising beams 38a, 38b extend between the arms 36a, 36b.                The
    stabilising beams 38a, 38b are spaced from one another and run parallel to one
    another across the full width of the shelf 17 (and the display area 15). The stabilising
15  beams 38a, 38b are arranged so that their widths extend in a vertical direction,
    substantially perpendicular to the shelf 17.      The stabilising beams 38a, 38b are,
    however, angled relative to one another so that the gap between the stabilising beams
    38a, 38b tapers toward the lower end of the stabilising beams 38a, 38b. The stabilising
    beams 38a, 38b thus define a first slot 39a having a vertical extent (length). The first
20  slot 39a comprises an inlet at an upper end and an outlet at a lower end. The inlet has
    a greater width than the outlet and a convergent throat is disposed between the inlet
    and the outlet. The stabilising beams 38a, 38b may taper at an angle of greater than
     O*and   less than 20* to the vertical. The angle may, however, differ between the two
    stabilising beams 38a, 38b within a single flow stabilising device 28. In particular, as
25  shown, the outermost stabilising beam 38a may be arranged vertically and the
    innermost stabilising beam 38b angled relative to the outermost stabilising beam 38a.
    The outermost stabilising beam 38a may be provided with a product information strip
    which can be used to display information regarding the products on the shelf portion 30
30  if the product information strip 34 of the shelf 17 itself is obscured by the stabilising
    beams 38a, 38b. Alternatively, the stabilising beams 38a, 38b may be transparent to
    allow the product information strip 34 of the shelf 17 to be viewed. This may also
    prevent the stabilising beams 38a, 38b from blocking light from a light source within the
    ORDC 2 and thus ensure proper illumination of the products within the ORDC.

    As shown in Figure 3, each of the shelves 17 is provided with a flow stabilising device
    28. The stabilising beams 38a, 38b of each shelf 17 are spaced from the shelf 17 so
    as to form a second slot 39b between the innermost stabilising beam 38b and the shelf
     17. The stabilising beams 38a, 38b are positioned such that the majority of the air
 5  curtain 26 passes between the stabilising beams 38a, 38b, through the first slot 39a. A
    portion of the air curtain 26 may pass between the innermost stabilising beam 38b and
    the shelf 17, through the second slot 39b, or beyond the exterior surface of the
    outermost stabilising beam 38a.        As described previously, the back panel 12 is
    perforated to allow air to pass from the duct 16 into the display area 15 where it cools
10  items located on the shelves 17 and on the lower panel 10. The direction of air flow
    from the back panel 12 is thus predominantly perpendicular to that of the air curtain 26.
    The air from the back panel 12 is entrained with the portion of the air curtain 26 passing
    through the second slot 39a which turns the air flow towards the direction of the air
    curtain 26. This reduces the effect the air flow from the back panel 12 has on the air
15  curtain 26.
    As described previously, the air curtain 26 may be angled away from vertical and the
    stabilising beams 38a, 38b may be spaced progressively further from the shelf 17 (or,
    where the shelves are of different lengths, from the back panel 12) from the uppermost
20  shelf 17 to the lowermost shelf 17 so as to be aligned with the air curtain 26. The
    spacing between the stabilising beams 38a, 38b may increase from the uppermost flow
    stabilising device 28 to the lowermost flow stabilising device 28 to account for the air
    curtain 26 becoming thicker as it passes down the front of the ORDC 2.
25  As described previously, the intake grille 18 is not directly aligned with the discharge
    grille 20. To counteract this, the stabilising beams 38a, 38b of the uppermost flow
    stabilising device 28 are curved so that the air curtain 26 is turned slightly as it passes
    through this flow stabilising device 28. As shown, the stabilising beams 38a, 38b of the
    uppermost flow stabilising device 28 may also run parallel to one another such that
30  they do not converge.
    Figures 4 and 5 provide a comparison of the flow characteristics of the air curtain 26
    without the flow stabilising devices 28 of the invention (Figure 4) and with the flow
    stabilising devices 28 (Figure 5).

    As shown in Figure 4, the air leaves the discharge grille 20 as a coherent jet 40.
    However, without the flow stabilising devices 28, the jet 40 soon becomes unstable in
    region 42, and begins to separate. This causes a high level of turbulent mixing in
    region 44 which warms the air curtain 26 considerably, thus warming the ORDC 2.
 5
    As shown in Figure 5, with the flow stabilising devices 28 attached to the shelves 17,
    the air again exits the discharge grille 20, but before the air curtain 26 can become
    unstable the flow stabilising device 28 acts to re-stabilise the flow.      As described
    previously, the stabilising beams 38a, 38b converge such that, as a result of the
10  Venturi effect, the air is accelerated as it passes through the first slot 39a of the flow
    stabilising device 28. The acceleration acts to further stabilise the air curtain 26. The
    width of the air curtain 26 is also reduced which helps maintain a thin shear layer
    throughout the length of the air curtain 26. The second slot 39b formed between the
    innermost stabilising beam 38b and the shelf 17 further promotes stabilisation of the air
15  curtain 26 by drawing air from the back panel 12 into the air curtain 26.
    The shelves 17 may be configured so as to allow the shelf portion 30 to be positioned
    at different angles. This may be beneficial for displaying different types of products.
    To allow for this, each flow stabilising device 28 may be pivotably connected to the
20  shelf 17 so that the flow stabilising device 28 remains horizontal (or at some other
    predetermined orientation).       For example, the arms 36a, 36b may be pivotably
    connected to the shelf 17. Alternatively, the arms 36a, 36b may each comprise first
    and second members connected to one another at an articulated joint. The arms 36a,
    36b may also allow the distance of the stabilising beams 38a, 38b from the shelf 17 to
25  be varied. In particular, as the shelf 17 is angled away from horizontal, its horizontal
    extent will reduce so that the stabilising beams 38a, 38b are located closer to the back
    panel 12. The arms 36a, 36b may therefore allow for this to be counteracted so that
    the stabilising beams 38a, 38b remain in the correct position for the air curtain 26. For
    example, the arms 36a, 36b may allow the stabilising beams 38a, 38b to be located in
30  a plurality of positions (e.g. defined by discrete mounting holes or a continuous slot) or
    the arms 36a, 36b themselves may be connected to the shelf 17 in a plurality of
    positions. Alternatively, the arms 38a, 38b may comprise a telescoping arrangement to
    alter their length.

    An initial study using Computational Fluid Dynamics has shown that the flow stabilising
    device 28 of the invention could provide a reduction of around 40% in convective heat
    losses.
 5  Although not shown, the flow stabilising device 28 may comprise an injector port which
    receives additional air. For example, the injector port may be connected to the duct 16
    via a conduit or the injector port may receive air which passes through the perforated
    back panel 12.      The injector port may be located adjacent the inlet of the flow
    stabilising device 28. The Venturi effect creates an area of low pressure within the flow
10  stabilising device 28 as the air curtain 26 is accelerated. This acts to draw in the
    additional air from the injector port which further increases the velocity of the air
    curtain, thus helping it to remain stable and intact in extreme ambient conditions.
    The flow stabilising devices 28 can be connected to a standard shelf 17 and thus allow
15  the flow stabilising devices 28 to be retrofit to existing ORDCs. The flow stabilising
    devices 28 may, however, be integrally formed with the shelves 17 or the ORDC 2. In
    this respect, "integral" is intended to convey that the flow stabilising devices 28 are
    located within the perimeter of the shelves 17, rather than being affixed thereto.
    Nevertheless, the flow stabilising devices 28 may still be removable from the remainder
20  of the shelf 17 to aid manufacturing and cleaning, for example.
    Although each shelf 17 of the ORDC 2 has been described as having a flow stabilising
    device 28, this need not be the case and only some of the shelves 17 may be provided
    with flow stabilising devices 28.      It is, however, desirable that the flow stabilising
25  devices 28 are provided at regular spacings of between 120mm and 190mm, which
    corresponds to approximately 4 to 6 times the width of the discharge grille 20, and
    preferably at spacings of around 160mm (5 times the width of the discharge grille 20).
    Although the flow stabilising devices 28 have been described as being connected
30  directly to the shelves 17, they may instead be connected to other parts of the ORDC
    2. For example, the arms 36a, 36b of the flow stabilising devices 28 may connect to
    the back panel 12 such that the flow stabilising devices 28 are positioned between
    adjacent shelves 17 (or between the lowermost shelf 17 and the lower panel 10). In
    particular, the flow stabilising devices 28 may be positioned just below each of the
35  shelves 17. Alternatively, the flow stabilising devices 28 may be connected to the left

    and right side walls of the ORDC 2. In this case, the arms 36a, 36b can be omitted and
    the stabilising beams 38a, 38b connected directly to the ORDC 2.
    The stabilising beams 38a, 38b also need not lie in the plane of the shelf 17.          For
 5  example, the stabilising beams 38a, 38b may be offset from the shelf 17 such that they
    are not aligned with the product information strip 34, thus allowing the product
    information strip 34 to be viewed. This may be achieved by using arms which are
    stepped or otherwise configured so that the connection to the shelf 17 and the
    connection to the stabilising beams 38a, 38b are offset from one another.
10
    In certain embodiments, the stabilising beams 38a, 38b may not converge and are
    instead arranged parallel to one another. Such parallel stabilising beams 38a, 38b may
    guide the air flow and prevent expansion of the air curtain, thus still re-stabilising the
    flow.

    Figure 6 shows a shelf 117 having a flow stabilising device 128 according to another
    embodiment of the invention. As shown, the shelf 117 comprises a shelf portion 130
    on which products may be displayed. The flow stabilising device 128 is integrated into
    the shelf 117 to form a single component. The flow stabilising device 128 forms a zone
20  of the shelf 117 at or toward an outermost edge of the shelf 117 (i.e. furthest from the
    back panel 12 of the ORDC 2).            The flow stabilising device 128 comprises a
    honeycomb panel which is embedded within the shelf 117. The honeycomb panel
    forms a matrix of open hexagonal cells extending in the direction of the air curtain 26.
    Each cell forms a stabilising channel through which air from the air curtain 26 (and
25  optionally from the back panel 12) can pass. The honeycomb panel is positioned to
    receive the entire air curtain 26. The stabilising channels have a uniform cross-section
    along their length such that the longitudinal axes of the sides extend parallel to one
    another.    However, the stabilising channels of adjacent flow stabilising devices 128
    may be angled relative to one another to redirect the air curtain.
30
    As shown in Figure 7, the flow stabilising device 128 is substantially coplanar with the
    shelf 117. Specifically, an upper surface of the flow stabilising device 128 (i.e. of the
    hexagonal cells) is substantially coplanar with an upper surface of the shelf portion
     130. A lower surface of the flow stabilising device 128 (i.e. of the hexagonal cells) may
35  also be substantially coplanar with a lower surface of the shelf portion 130 such that

   WO 2015/198076                                                           PCT/GB2015/051891
                                                   11
    the flow stabilising device lies within the vertical bounds of the upper and lower
    surfaces of the shelf portion 130. The flow stabilising device 128 thus forms an integral
    part of the shelf portion 130 which does not obstruct the view of and access to products
    located on the shelf portion 130, or on adjacent shelves 117.
 5
    As shown in Figure 7, in use, the flow stabilising device 128 acts to re-stabilise the flow
    of the air curtain 26 after it exits the discharge grille 20 before it can become unstable.
    Specifically, the stabilising channels guide the air flow and prevent expansion of the air
    curtain 26 as it passes down the front of the ORDC 2. They may also redirect air from
10  the back panel 12 toward the direction of the air curtain 26.
    In other embodiments, the flow stabilising device 128 may be a separate component
    which is attached to an existing shelf. This may allow the flow stabilising device 128 to
    be angled relative to the shelf portion 130, particularly when the shelf 117 itself is
15  inclined. In this manner, the flow stabilising device 128 may also be offset from the
    shelf 117. However, even where the flow stabilising device 128 is provided within the
    body of the shelf (as shown in Figure 6), it may still be possible to angle the flow
    stabilising device relative to the shelf portion 130. For example, the flow stabilising
    device 128 may be pivotably mounted via a gimbal joint. With this arrangement, it may
20  be desirable for the upper surface of the flow stabilising device 128 to remain at or
    below the level of the upper surface of the shelf 117 at each angular position. It may
    also be possible to adjust the fore and aft position of the flow stabilising device 128
    within the body of the shelf. For example, the flow stabilising device 128 may be
    mounted on rails to allow it to be moved. The flow stabilising device 128 may be
25  moved along the rails so as to receive the entire curtain. Cover plates may be provided
    to between the flow stabilising device and the shelf 117 to maximise the usable area of
    the shelf portion 130.
    Although the flow stabilising device 128 has been described as being formed by a
30  honeycomb panel, it will be appreciated that other cellular structures may be used with
    form a matrix of flow stabilising channels.
    Although the upper surface of the flow stabilising device 128 has been described as
    being substantially coplanar with the upper surface of the shelf portion 130, it may also
35  lie below the level of the upper surface of the shelf portion 130. It is, however, useful

                                                12
    for the upper surfaces to be substantially coplanar so as to form a continuous surface.
    This may aid removing items from the shelf, particularly where they are heavy and the
    customer wishes to slide the item across the surface of the shelf. On the other hand,
    the lower surface of the flow stabilising device 128 may terminate above or project
 5  below the lower surface of the shelf portion 130. However, it is desirable, particularly
    where the shelves are close together relative to the height of goods on the shelf
    portions 130, that the lower surface of the flow stabilising device 128 terminates at or
    above the level of the shelf portion 130 so as not to obstruct the view of and access to
    the shelf 117 below.
