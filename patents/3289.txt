and one or more photochromic-dichroic materials that each include at least one chiral or

radiation blocking transparency is interposed between the photochromic article and a
source of actinic radiation.
[002]        The present application is a divisional application of Australian Application
No.    2014237729,      which    is   the    Australian   national   phase    application   of
PCT/US2014/021213,        and    claims    the    benefit  of   U.S. Provisional  Application
No. 13/835,413, filed 15 March 2013, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference
in their entirety.
                                        BACKGROUND
[003]        Conventional linearly polarizing elements, such as linearly polarizing lenses
for sunglasses and linearly polarizing filters, are typically formed from stretched polymer
sheets containing a dichroic material,         such as a dichroic dye.         Consequently,
conventional linearly polarizing elements are static elements having a single, linearly
polarizing state.     Accordingly, when a conventional linearly polarizing element is
exposed to either randomly polarized radiation or reflected radiation of the appropriate
wavelength, some percentage of the radiation transmitted through the element will be
linearly polarized.
[004]        In addition, conventional linearly polarizing elements are typically tinted.
Typically, conventional linearly polarizing elements contain a coloring agent and have an
absorption spectrum that does not vary in response to actinic radiation. The color of the
conventional linearly polarizing element will depend upon the coloring agent used to
form the element, and most commonly, is a neutral color (for example, brown or gray).
Thus, while conventional linearly polarizing elements are useful in reducing reflected
light glare, because of their tint, they are typically not well suited for use under low-light
conditions.
                                                1

[005]        Conventional linearly polarizing elements are typically formed using sheets of
stretched polymer films containing a dichroic material. Correspondingly, while dichroic
materials are capable of preferentially absorbing one of two orthogonal plane polarized
components of transmitted radiation, if the molecules of the dichroic material are not
suitably positioned or arranged, no net linear polarization of transmitted radiation will be
achieved. Without intending to be bound by any theory it is believed that due to the
random positioning of the molecules of the dichroic material, selective absorption by the
individual molecules will cancel each other such that no net or overall linear polarizing
effect is achieved. As such, it is typically necessary to position or arrange the molecules
of the dichroic material by alignment with another material so as to achieve a net linear
polarization.
[006]       A common method of aligning the molecules of a dichroic dye involves
heating a sheet or layer of polyvinyl alcohol ("PVA") to soften the PVA and then
stretching the sheet to orient the PVA polymer chains. Thereafter, the dichroic dye is
impregnated into the stretched sheet, and the impregnated dye molecules adopt the
orientation of the polymer chains.      Resultantly, at least some of the dye molecules
become aligned, such that the long axis of each aligned dye molecule is generally
parallel to the oriented polymer chains.       Alternatively, the dichroic dye can be first
impregnated into the PVA sheet, and thereafter the sheet can be heated and stretched
as described above to orient the PVA polymer chains and associated dye.               In this
manner, the molecules of the dichroic dye can be suitably positioned or arranged
amongst the oriented polymer chains of the PVA sheet, and a net linear polarization can
be correspondingly achieved.        As a result, the PVA sheet can be made to linearly
polarize transmitted radiation, and correspondingly a linearly polarizing filter can thus be
formed.
[007]        Conventional photochromic elements, such as photochromic lenses that are
formed using conventional photochromic materials are generally capable of converting
from a first state, for example a "clear state," to a second state, for example a "colored
state," in response to exposure to actinic radiation, and reverting back to the first state
when exposure to the actinic radiation is discontinued or reduced. Thus, conventional
photochromic elements are generally well suited for use in both low-light and bright
conditions. Conventional photochromic elements, however, that do not include linearly
polarizing filters are generally not capable of linearly polarizing radiation. The absorption
                                              2

ratio of conventional photochromic elements, in either state, is generally less than two.
Therefore, conventional photochromic elements are not capable of reducing reflected
light glare to the same extent as conventional linearly polarizing elements.
[008]        With conventional photochromic elements that are activated by exposure to
actinic radiation that includes ultraviolet (UV) light, when a UV light absorbing filter is
positioned between the source of actinic radiation and the conventional photochromic
element, the conventional photochromic element typically will not be sufficiently
converted from a first non-colored state to a second colored state. An example of such
a UV light absorbing filter is a transparency that includes at least one layer of
silica-based glass, such as windshields used in automotive, nautical, aircraft, and railway
applications.
[009]        It would be desirable to develop new photochromic articles that provide a
combination of photochromic properties and linearly polarizing properties that are both
activated by exposure to a source of actinic radiation passing through a transparent
filter, such as a windshield.

[0102]     Other than in the operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all
numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in
the specification and claims are to be understood as modified in all instances by the term
"about."
[0103]     The photochromic materials and compounds of the photochromic articles of
the present invention as described herein, including photochromic materials (1) through
(14) and the related Formulas, and related photochromic compounds, in each case
optionally further include one or more coproducts, resulting from the synthesis of such
photochromic materials and compounds.
[0104]     As    used herein, the term "photochromic" and similar terms, such as
"photochromic compound" means having an absorption spectrum for at least visible
radiation that varies in response to absorption of at least actinic radiation. Further, as
                                               33

used herein the term "photochromic material" means any substance that is adapted to
display photochromic properties (such as, adapted to have an absorption spectrum for at
least visible radiation that varies in response to absorption of at least actinic radiation)
and which includes at least one photochromic compound.
[0105]     As used herein, the term "actinic radiation" means electromagnetic radiation
that is capable of causing a response in a material, such as, but not limited to,
transforming a photochromic material from one form or state to another as will be
discussed in further detail herein.
[0106]     As used herein, the term "photochromic material" includes thermally reversible
photochromic materials and compounds and non-thermally reversible photochromic
materials    and     compounds.          The    term   "thermally  reversible   photochromic
compounds/materials"        as   used    herein   means    compounds/materials   capable of
converting from a first state, for example a "clear state," to a second state, for example a
"colored state," in response to actinic radiation, and reverting back to the first state in
response to thermal energy.             The term "non-thermally reversible photochromic
compounds/materials"        as   used    herein   means    compounds/materials   capable of
converting from a first state, for example a "clear state," to a second state, for example a
"colored state," in response to actinic radiation, and reverting back to the first state in
response to actinic radiation          of substantially the same wavelength(s)       as the
absorption(s) of the colored state (e.g., discontinuing exposure to such actinic radiation).
[0107]     As used herein to modify the term "state," the terms "first" and "second" are not
intended to refer to any particular order or chronology, but instead refer to two different
conditions or properties. For purposes of non-limiting illustration, the first state and the
second state of a photochromic compound can differ with respect to at least one optical
property, such as but not limited to the absorption of visible and/or UV radiation. Thus,
according to various non-limiting embodiments disclosed herein, the photochromic
compounds of the present invention can have a different absorption spectrum in each of
the first and second state.        For example, while not limiting herein, a photochromic
compound of the present invention can be clear in the first state and colored in the
second state.    Alternatively, a photochromic compound of the present invention can
have a first color in the first state and a second color in the second state.

[0135]      The Behind the Windshield Test and the Outdoor Test are described in
further detail in the Examples herein below. In summary, test samples containing behind
the windshield (BWS) photochromic materials with or without other photochromic
materials are tested for photochromic response (e.g., the change in optical density) with
the simulated windshield in place under conditions simulating an eyeglass wearer behind
an automotive windshield exposure versus conditions simulating outdoor exposure in the
Outdoor Test (OS). The retained optical density is calculated by using the following
formula:
                         %AOD Retained = 100 x (AODBws/AODos).
[0136]      The term "AOD" and equivalent recitations, such as "delta OD," means
change in optical density (OD) and is determined according to the formula:
                                   AOD = log(%Tb/%Ta)
In the above formula, %Tb is the percent transmittance in the bleached state (or
non-colored state), %Ta is the percent transmittance in the activated state (or colored
state) and the logarithm is to the base 10. Optical density measurements are with some
embodiments per specific wavelength or photopic. A method of determining change in
optical density (AOD) is described in further detail herein in the examples.
[0137]      As used herein, "percent fatigue" is determined by measuring the difference
between the change in optical density (AOD) of a test sample before and after exposing
the test sample to accelerated weathering, and is quantified in accordance with the
formula:
                         % Fatigue = (AODinit-AODfinaI)/ AODimii x 100.
[0138]      In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, the
photochromic article is adapted to retain at least 20 percent of the delta OD (AOD) (or
coloration) measured in the Outdoor Test when tested in the Behind the Windshield
Test. With some further embodiments, the photochromic article is adapted t retain at
least 25 percent of the delta OD (AOD) (or coloration) measured in the Outdoor Test
when tested in the Behind the Windshield Test.              With some embodiments, the
photochromic article is adapted to retain less than or equal to 100 percent of the delta
                                              40

OD (AOD) (or coloration) measured in the Outdoor Test when tested in the Behind the
Windshield Test.    The delta OD (AOD) of the photochromic articles of the present
invention can range between any combination of the recited upper and lower values,
inclusive of the recited values.   With some embodiments, the photochromic article is
adapted to retain from 20 percent to 100 percent, or from 20 percent to 90 percent, or
from 25 percent to 50 percent of the delta OD (AOD) (or coloration) measured in the
Outdoor Test when tested in the Behind the Windshield Test.
[0139]      With some embodiments, the photochromic article of the present invention is

[0243]       In accordance with some embodiments, the photochromic article includes, in
addition to at least one photochromic material (1) through (14), at least one fixed tint dye
(or fixed colorant or fixed dye or fixed tint).        The fixed tint dye can, with some
                                               79

embodiments, be selected from azo dyes, anthraquinone dyes, xanthene dyes, azime
dyes,    iodine,   iodide    salts,   polyazo     dyes,  stilbene dyes,  pyrazolone  dyes,
triphenylmethane dyes, quinoline dyes, oxazine dyes, thiazine dyes, polyene dyes, and
mixtures thereof.
[0244]      The fixed tint dye, with some embodiments, can be present in the
photochromic article in amounts sufficient to provide a desired color and percent
transmittance of actinic radiation, such as visible light. The types and amounts of fixed
tint dye can be selected, with some embodiments, to provide the photochromic with a
base color and base percent transmittance, when the photochromic compound(s) of the
photochromic article undergoes neither photochromic activation nor dichroic activation.
The types and amounts of fixed tint dye can be selected, with some embodiments, to
provide the photochromic article with one or more activated colors and one or more
activated percent transmittance values, when the photochromic compound(s) of the
photochromic article undergoes photochromic activation and/or dichroic activation. The
fixed tint dye can be present in the photochromic article in varying amounts to provide
the intended effect such as done with other conventional additives.
[0245]       In accordance with some non-limiting embodiments, adjuvant materials can
also be incorporated into host material used to produce the photochromic articles of the
present invention.      Such adjuvants can be used, prior to, simultaneously with, or
subsequent to application or incorporation of the photochromic material. For purposes
of non-limiting illustration, ultraviolet light absorbers can be admixed with photochromic
materials before their addition to the composition or such absorbers can be superposed,
e.g., superimposed, as a coating between the photochromic article and the incident light.
[0246]       Further, stabilizers can be used in conjunction with the photochromic
materials (such as being admixed with the photochromic materials prior to their addition
to a composition) to improve the light fatigue resistance of the photochromic materials,
provided that such stabilizers do not prevent the photochromic materials from activating.
Non-limiting examples of stabilizers include, hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS),
asymmetric diaryloxalamide (oxanilide) compounds, and singlet oxygen quenchers (e.g.,
a nickel ion complex with an organic ligand) polyphenolic antioxidants, or mixtures of
such stabilizers are contemplated. In some non-limiting embodiments, stabilizers can be
used alone or in combination. Non-limiting examples of stabilizers are described in U.S.
Patents 4,720,356, 5,391,327 and 5,770,115.

[0247]      In accordance with some embodiments, photochromic article is adapted to
exhibit a neutral activated color. A neutral activated color can be achieved, with some
embodiments, by selection of the photochromic material(s) (1) through (14) alone, and
optionally in combination with (a) one or more photochromic materials that are different
than photochromic materials (1)-(14), and/or (b) one or more fixed tint dyes, as
described above. With some embodiments, the photochromic article is adapted so as to
exhibit a desired resultant color, e.g., a substantially neutral color when activated with
unfiltered sunlight, e.g., as near a neutral color as possible given the colors of the
activated photochromic materials, and a retained coloration, measured as delta OD or
AOD, of at least 12 percent of that demonstrated under conditions of outdoor exposure
when tested in the Behind the Windshield Test described herein in the Examples.          In
accordance with some alternate non-limiting embodiments, the photochromic articles of
the present invention demonstrate an activated state luminous transmittance at
saturation less than 60 percent when activated under the conditions in the Behind the
Windshield Test.     In one non-limiting embodiment, the BWS photochromic materials
could be used to produce articles having a wide range of colors, e.g., pink.        Further
discussion of neutral colors and ways to describe colors can be found in U.S. Patent
5,645,767 column 12, line 66 to column 13, line 19.
[0248]      In accordance with some non-limiting embodiments, it is contemplated that
the photochromic materials of the present invention (1)-(14) ("BWS photochromic
materials") can each be used alone or in combination with other BWS photochromic
materials of the present invention, or in combination with one or more other
photochromic materials, e.g., photochromic materials having at least one activated
absorption maxima within the range of between about 400 and 700 nanometers, and can
be incorporated, e.g., dissolved or dispersed, in a polymeric organic host material used
to prepare photochromic articles, which become colored when activated to an
appropriate hue.
[0249]      With some embodiments, the photochromic article further includes at least
one other photochromic material (c) that is different from photochromic material (b). The
other photochromic material (c) can, with some embodiments, be selected from an
organic photochromic material, inorganic photochromic material or a mixture thereof.
[0250]      Classes    of  organic   photochromic     materials  from   which   the  other
photochromic material (c) can be selected include, but are not limited to, naphthopyrans,

inorganic photochromic materials are described in Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of
Chemical Technology, 4th Edition, Volume 6, pages 322-325, which disclosure is
incorporated herein by reference.
[0252]       In accordance with some embodiments, the other photochromic material (c)
can include the following classes of materials: chromenes, e.g., naphthopyrans,
benzopyrans, indenonaphthopyrans and phenanthropyrans; spiropyrans, e.g.,

Serial No. 09/828,260 filed April 6, 2001. The disclosures of the aforementioned patents
on polymerizable photochromic materials are incorporated herein by reference.
[0255]      Further classes of other photochromic materials (c) include, but are not
limited to: organo-metal dithiozonates, e.g., (arylazo)-thioformic arylhydrazidates, e.g.,
mercury dithizonates which are described in, for example, U.S. Patent 3,361,706 at
column 2, line 27 to column 8, line 43; and fulgides and fulgimides, e.g., the 3-furyl and
3-thienyl fulgides and fulgimides, which are described in U.S. Patent 4,931,220 at
column 1, line 39 through column 22, line 41, the disclosures of which are incorporated
herein by reference.
[0256]      With some further embodiments, the other photochromic material (c) can be
selected from organic photochromic materials that are resistant to the effects of a
polymerization initiator. Examples of such organic photochromic materials include, but
are not limited to, photochromic compounds encapsulated in metal oxides, such as
described in United States Patents 4,166,043 and 4,367,170 at column 1 line 36 to
column 7, line 12, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.
[0257]      The photochromic articles of the present invention can include one or more
photochromic materials (1)-(14) within the substrate and/or one or more photochromic
materials (1)-(14) in one or more coatings, one or more films, and/or one or more sheets
applied over the substrate.
[0258]      With some embodiments, one or more of the photochromic materials (1)-(14)
can be: incorporated, such as dissolved and/or dispersed, into the substrate, such as by
imbibition; polymerized with other components from which the substrate is prepared,
such as with reaction injection molding; incorporated or mixed with other components
from which the substrate is prepared, such as with injection molding of thermoplastic
materials; and/or incorporated into an at least partial coating or film applied to a
substrate, such as an at least partially cured polymeric coating or a film applied to one
surface of the substrate.    The term "imbibition" or "imbibe" is intended to mean and
                                            83

include    permeation   of the     photochromic   materials    individually or   with  other
non-photochromic materials into a polymerizate, solvent assisted transfer absorption of
the photochromic materials into a polymerizate, vapor phase transfer, and other such
transfer mechanisms.
[0259]      With some embodiments, the substrate includes at least one photochromic
material (b) (1-14). With some further embodiments, the substrate further comprises at
least one photochromic material (c) that is different from photochromic material (b)
(1-14).
[0260]      In accordance with some embodiments, the photochromic article of the
present invention further includes a coating that has an at least partially cured polymer
matrix, applied to at least one surface of the substrate. With some further embodiments,
the at least partially cured polymeric coating includes one or more photochromic
materials (b) (1-14). With some additional embodiments, the coating further includes at
least one other photochromic material (c) that is different from photochromic material (b).
[0261]      As used herein the term "polymeric host" includes and refers to the terms
polymeric substrate, polymeric film, and/or polymeric coating. Generally, the polymeric
host is such that it allows the photochromic material (b) of the present invention and
other optional photochromic materials (c) to reversibly transform between their "open"
and "closed" forms. With some non-limiting embodiments, the polymer and/or polymeric
coating composition used to produce the photochromic articles of the present invention
includes compositions adapted to provide thermoplastic or thermosetting organic
polymeric materials that are described in the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical
Technology, Fourth Edition, Volume 6, pages 669 to 760, which disclosure is
incorporated herein by reference.      Such polymeric host materials can be transparent,
translucent or opaque; but are transparent with some embodiments.                With other
non-limiting contemplated embodiments, the polymeric host material is a polymeric
material that upon curing forms an at least partially cured polymeric coating chosen from
polyurethanes,    aminoplast    resins,   poly(meth)acrylates,    e.g.,  polyacrylates  and
polymethacrylates, polyanhydrides, polyacrylamides, epoxy resins and polysilanes.
[0262]      With some non-limiting embodiments, the amount of the photochromic
material (b) to be applied to or incorporated into a polymeric host material, such as a
polymeric coating composition, of the photochromic article of the present invention can
vary widely.    Typically, a sufficient amount is used to produce the desired retained
                                             84

coloration behind an UV blocking transparency such as a vehicular windshield.
Generally such an amount can be described as a behind the UV blocking transparency
activating amount or behind the windshield activating amount. The particular amount
used depends often upon the retained coloration desired upon irradiation thereof and
upon the method used to incorporate or apply the photochromic material(s) (b).
Typically, with some non-limiting embodiments, the more photochromic material (b)
applied or incorporated, the greater is the coloration retained behind the windshield up to
a certain limit. There is a point after which the addition of any more material will not
have a noticeable effect, although more material can be added, if desired.
[0263]      With    some embodiments of the present invention, the UV                 blocking
transparency is a vehicular windshield. Examples of vehicular windshields include, but
are not limited to, automobile windshields, truck windshields, train windshields,
motorcycle windshields, golf cart windshields, windshields used with aquatic craft (such
as wave-runners, boats, and ships), and aircraft windshields.
[0264]      With some non-limiting embodiments, the amount of the other photochromic
material(s) (c) incorporated into a polymeric host material, such as the substrate and/or
coating, can vary widely.        Typically, a sufficient amount is used to produce a
photochromic effect discernible to the naked eye upon activation.             Generally such
amount can be described as a photochromic amount.               The particular amount used
depends often upon the intensity of color desired upon irradiation thereof and upon the
method used to incorporate the photochromic materials.                 Typically, with some
non-limiting embodiments, the more photochromic material (c) incorporated, the greater
is the color intensity up to a certain limit. There is a point after which the addition of any
more material will not have a noticeable effect, although more material can be added, if
desired.
[0265]      The relative amounts of the photochromic material (b) or combinations of
photochromic materials (b) and other optional photochromic material(s) (c) used will vary
and depend in part upon the relative intensities of the color of the activated species of
such materials, the ultimate color desired, the retained coloration desired and the
method of application to the host material and/or substrate.              In one non-limiting
embodiment,      the amount of total        photochromic    material  which   includes BWS
photochromic materials, other photochromic materials or both, incorporated by imbibition
into a photochromic optical host material can vary widely.              With some alternate
                                               85

non-limiting embodiments, the amount can range from about 0.01 to about 2.0, or from
0.05 to about 1.0, milligrams per square centimeter of surface to which the photochromic
material is incorporated or applied.       The amount of total photochromic material
incorporated or applied to the host material can range between any combination of these
values, inclusive of the recited range, e.g., 0.015 to 1.999 milligrams per square
centimeter.
[0266]      With   some     further non-limiting   embodiments,     the    total amount     of
photochromic material      (b),  and optionally (c), incorporated     into a polymerizable
composition for forming a coating, film or polymerizate can vary widely. With some
embodiments, the amount incorporated can range from 0.01 to 40 weight percent based
on the weight of the solids in the polymerizable composition.          With some alternate
non-limiting embodiments, the concentration of photochromic materials ranges from 0.1
to 30 weight percent, from 1 to 20 weight percent, from 5 to 15 weight percent, or from 7
to 14 weight percent. The amount of photochromic material(s) in the coating can range
between any combination of these values, inclusive of the recited range, such as from
0.011 to 39.99 weight percent.
[0267]      The various coating compositions described below are well known and are
made with components and according to methods well understood and appreciated to
those skilled in the art. Suitable substrates for the application of coatings containing the
photochromic materials (b) or a mixture of the photochromic materials (b) and other
optional photochromic materials (c) include any type of substrate. Non-limiting examples
include, paper, glass, ceramics, wood, masonry, textiles, metals and organic polymeric
materials as host materials.
[0268]      Photochromic polyurethane coatings that can be used to prepare the
photochromic coated       articles of the    present invention, with      some   non-limiting
embodiments, can be produced by the catalyzed or uncatalyzed reaction of an organic
polyol component and an isocyanate component in the presence of photochromic
compound(s). Materials and methods for the preparation of polyurethanes are described
in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Fifth Edition, 1992, Vol. A21, pages
665 to 716.     Non-limiting examples of methods and materials, e.g., organic polyols,
isocyanates and other components, which can be used to prepare the polyurethane
coating are disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,889,413 and 6,187,444B1.

[0269]      Photochromic aminoplast resin coating compositions that can be used to
produce the photochromic coated articles of the present invention, with some non
limiting embodiments, can be prepared by combining a photochromic material with the
reaction product of a functional component(s) having at least two functional groups
chosen from hydroxyl, carbamate, urea or a mixture thereof and an aminoplast resin,
e.g., crosslinking agent as described in U.S. Patents 4,756,973, 6,432,544B1 and
6,506,488.
[0270]      Photochromic polysilane coating compositions contemplated for use in
preparing the photochromic coated articles of the present invention, with some
non-limiting embodimentd, are prepared by hydrolyzing at least one silane monomer
such           as          glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane,         vinyltrimethoxysilane,
methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane,      tetramethoxysilane,  tetraethoxysilane     and/or
methyltrimethoxysilane and combining the hydrolyzate with at least one photochromic
material as described in U.S. Patent 4,556,605.
[0271]      Photochromic poly(meth)acrylate coating compositions contemplated for use
in preparing the photochromic coated articles of the present invention can be prepared,
with some non-limiting embodiments, by combining photochromic compound(s) with
mono-, di- or multi-functional (meth)acrylates as described in U.S. Patents 6,025,026
and 6,150,430 and WO publication 01/02449 A2.
[0272]      Polyanhydride photochromic coating compositions that can be used to
prepare the photochromic coated articles of the present invention can be prepared with
some non-limiting embodiments, by the reaction of a hydroxyl-functional component and
a polymeric anhydride-functional component in a composition including at least one
organic photochromic material as described in U.S. Patent 6,432,544B1.        Non-limiting
examples of hydroxyl-functional components, anhydride-functional component(s) and
other components that can be used to prepare the polyanhydride photochromic coatings
are disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,798,745, 4,798,746 and 5,239,012.
[0273]      Photochromic polyacrylamide coating compositions contemplated for use in
preparing the photochromic coated articles of the present invention, with some
non-limiting embodiments, can be prepared by combining a photochromic component
with the free radical     initiated reaction product of a polymerizable       ethylenically
unsaturated composition comprising N-alkoxymethyl(meth)acrylamide and at least one
other copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer as described in U.S. Patent
                                             87

6,060,001. Methods for preparing N-alkoxymethyl(meth)acrylamide functional polymer
are described in U.S. Patent 5,618,586.
[0274]       Photochromic epoxy resin coating compositions that can be used to prepare
the photochromic coated articles of the present invention, with some non-limiting
embodiments, can be prepared by combining photochromic compound(s), epoxy resins
or polyepoxides and curing agents as described in U.S. Patents 4,756,973 and
6,268,055B1.
[0275]       With some non-limiting embodiments, the types of photochromic polymeric
coatings including the film-forming polymers and the photochromic materials (b) of the
present invention with or without other optional photochromic compounds (c) include
paints, e.g., a pigmented liquid or paste used for the decoration, protection and/or the
identification of a substrate; and inks, e.g., a pigmented liquid or paste used for writing
and printing on substrates such as in producing verification marks on security
documents, e.g., documents such as banknotes, passport and drivers' licenses, for
which authentication or verification of authenticity may be desired.
[0276]       Application of the polymeric coating can be by any of the methods used in
coating technology, non-limiting examples include, spray coating, spin coating, spin and
spray coating, spread coating, curtain coating, dip coating, casting or roll-coating and
methods used in preparing overlays, such as the method of the type described in U.S.
Patent 4,873,029.        The application method selected also depends, with some
embodiments, on the thickness of the desired coating.
[0277]       The thickness of the coatings on/of the photochromic articles of the present
invention can vary widely. Coatings having a thickness ranging from 1 to 50 microns
can be applied by the methods used in coating technology. Coatings of a thickness
greater than 50 microns can require the application of multiple coatings or molding
methods typically used for overlays. With some non-limiting embodiments, the coating
can range in thickness from 1 to 10,000 microns, or from 5 to 1000, or from 8 to 400, or
from 10 to 250 microns. The thickness of the polymeric coating can range between any
combination of these values, inclusive of the recited range, such as a thickness of from
20 to 200 microns.
[0278]       Following application of the polymeric coating composition to a surface of the
substrate, with some non-limiting embodiments, the coating composition is at least
                                              88

partially cured.   With some further non-limiting embodiments, the methods used for
curing the photochromic polymeric coating include the methods used for forming an at
least partially cured polymer.   Such methods include radical polymerization, thermal
polymerization, photopolymerization or a combination thereof. Additional non-limiting
methods include irradiating the coated substrate or at least partially cured polymer with
infrared, ultraviolet, gamma or electron radiation so as to initiate the polymerization
reaction of the polymerizable components. This can be followed by a heating step.
[0279]      With some non-limiting embodiments, if required and if appropriate, the
surface of the substrate to be coated is cleaned prior to applying the photochromic
polymeric coating to produce the photochromic article of the present invention. This can
be done for the purposes of cleaning and/or promoting adhesion of the coating.
Effective treatment techniques for plastics and glass are known to those skilled in the
art.
[0280]      With some non-limiting embodiments, it may be necessary to apply a primer
to the surface of the substrate before application of the photochromic polymeric coating.
The primer can serve as a barrier coating to prevent interaction of the coating
ingredients with the substrate and/or vice versa, and/or as an adhesive layer to adhere
the photochromic polymeric coating to the substrate. Application of the primer can be by
any of the methods used in coating technology such as, for example, spray coating, spin
coating, spin and spray coating, spread coating, dip coating, casting or roll-coating.
[0281]      The use of protective coatings, some of which can contain polymer-forming
organosilanes, as primers to improve adhesion of subsequently applied coatings has
been described in U.S. Patent 6,150,430, which disclosure is incorporated herein by
reference.     With some non-limiting embodiments, non-tintable coatings are used.
Non-limiting examples of commercial coating products include SILVUE 124 and HI
GARD@ coatings, available from SDC Coatings, Inc. and PPG Industries, Inc.,
respectively. In addition, depending on the intended use of the coated article, with some
non-limiting embodiments, it can be necessary to apply an appropriate protective
coating(s), such as an abrasion resistant coating and/or coatings that can serve as
oxygen barriers, onto the exposed surface of the coating composition to prevent
scratches from the effects of friction and abrasion and interactions of oxygen with the
photochromic materials, respectively.
                                            89

[0282]      With   some      embodiments,      the primer   and   protective   coatings   are
interchangeable, in which case the same coating composition can be used as the primer
and the protective coating(s). Non-limiting examples of hardcoats include those based
on inorganic materials such as silica, titania and/or zirconia as well as organic hardcoats
of the type that are ultraviolet light curable.
[0283]      With some non-limiting embodiments, such protective coatings can be
applied to the surface of photochromic articles including at least partially cured polymers
containing photochromic materials.
[0284]      With some non-limiting embodiments, the photochromic article of the present
invention includes a substrate to which a primer is applied followed by the photochromic
polymeric coating and a protective hardcoat. With further non-limiting embodiments, the
protective hardcoat is an organosilane hardcoat.
[0285]      With some additional non-limiting embodiments, other coatings or surface
treatments, such as a tintable coating, antireflective surface, etc., can also be, applied to
the photochromic articles of the present invention. An antireflective coating, such as a
monolayer or multilayer of metal oxides, metal fluorides, or other such materials, can be
deposited onto the photochromic articles, e.g., lenses, of the present invention through
vacuum evaporation, sputtering, or some other method.
[0286]      With further non-limiting embodiments, the photochromic article that includes
an at least partially cured polymer and at least one photochromic material (b) with or
without other photochromic material(s) (c) further includes a superstrate, e.g., a film or
sheet comprising at least one organic polymeric material. The photochromic material (b)
and optionally (c) can be located in the superstrate, the at least partially cured polymer
or both. The organic polymeric material of the superstrate is the same as the organic
polymeric material described hereinafter as the substrate or host material. Non-limiting
examples of the organic polymeric materials include thermosetting or thermoplastic
materials, for example a thermoplastic polyurethane superstrate.
[0287]      With still further non-limiting embodiments, the superstrate can be connected
to the polymer surface directly, but does not become thermally fused to the substrate.
With other non-limiting embodiments, the superstrate can be adheringly bonded to the
substrate by becoming thermally fused with the subsurface of the substrate.          General
conditions under which superstrates are adheringly bonded to a substrate are known to
                                                90

those skilled in the art. Non-limiting conditions for adheringly laminating a superstrate to
a substrate include heating to a temperature of from 250-350"F (121 - 177"C) and
applying pressure of from 150 to 400 pounds per square inch (psi)(1034 to 2758 kPa).
Sub-atmospheric pressures, e.g., a vacuum, can also be applied to draw down and
conform the superstrate to the shape of the substrate as known to those skilled in the
art. Non-limiting examples include applying at a sub-atmospheric pressure within the
range of from 0.001 mm Hg to 20 mm Hg ( 0.13 Pa to 2.7 kPa).
[0288]       After a laminate that includes a superstrate applied to at least one surface of
a substrate is formed, it can further include a protective coating or film superposed onto
the superstrate.     Such a protective coating or film, in one non-limiting embodiment,
serves as an at least partially abrasion resistant coating or film. Non-limiting types of
protective coatings include the aforedescribed hardcoats that are curable by ultraviolet
radiation and/or that contain organosilanes. The thickness of the protective coating can
vary widely and include the aforementioned range for the photochromic polymeric
coatings. Non-limiting types of protective films include those made of organic polymeric
materials such as thermosetting and thermoplastic materials.         In another non-limiting
embodiment, the protective film is a thermoplastic film made of polycarbonate.          The
thickness of the protective film or sheet can vary widely. Typically, such films have a
thickness of from 1 to 20 mils (0.025 to 0.5 mm).
[0289]       The host material, such as the substrate, of the photochromic material (b)
with or without other photochromic material(s) (c) is usually be transparent, but may be
translucent or even opaque. The host material need only be pervious to that portion of
the electromagnetic spectrum, which activates the photochromic material, e.g., that
wavelength of ultraviolet (UV) light that produces the open or colored form of the
photochromic and that portion of the visible spectrum that includes the absorption
maximum wavelength of the photochromic in its UV activated form, e.g., the open form.
In one contemplated non-limiting embodiment, the host color should not be such that it
masks the color of the activated form of the photochromic materials, e.g., so the change
in color is readily apparent to the observer. Compatible tints may be applied to the host
material as described in U.S. Patent 5,645,767 in column 13, line 59 to column 14, line
3.
[0290]       With some non-limiting embodiments, the polymeric organic host material can
be a solid transparent or optically clear material, e.g., materials having a luminous
                                              91

transmittance of at least 70 percent and are suitable for optical applications, such as
optical elements chosen from plano and ophthalmic lenses, ocular devices such as
ophthalmic devices that physically reside in or on the eye, e.g., contact lenses and
intraocular lenses, windows, automotive transparencies, e.g., windshields, aircraft
transparencies, plastic sheeting, polymeric films, etc.
[0291]      With some embodiments of the present invention, the substrate of the
photochromic article is an optical element. With some further embodiments, the optical
element is an ophthalmic lens.
[0292]      Non-limiting examples of polymeric organic materials which can be used as a
host material for the photochromic materials (b) of the present invention with or without
other photochromic materials (c) or as a substrate for a photochromic polymeric coating
include:    poly(meth)acrylates,        polyurethanes,      polythiourethanes,       thermoplastic
polycarbonates,     polyesters,     poly(ethylene    terephthalate),   polystyrene,     poly(alpha

polyvinylbutyral, poly(vinyl acetate), cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose
butyrate, cellulose acetate butyrate, polystyrene or polymers, such as homopolymers
and copolymers prepared by polymerizing monomers chosen from bis(allyl carbonate)
monomers,      styrene    monomers,       diisopropenyl   benzene    monomers,       vinylbenzene
monomers, e.g., those described in U.S. Patent 5,475,074, diallylidene pentaerythritol
monomers,      polyol   (allyl   carbonate)    monomers,     e.g.,  diethylene    glycol   bis(allyl
carbonate), vinyl acetate monomers, acrylonitrile monomers, mono- or polyfunctional,
e.g.,   di-  or   multi-functional,    (meth)acrylate     monomers      such    as    (C,-C1 2 )alkyl
(meth)acrylates, e.g., methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate
etc.,   poly(oxyalkylene)(meth)acrylate,         poly(alkoxylated    phenol     (meth)acrylates),
diethylene glycol (meth)acrylates, ethoxylated bisphenol A (meth)acrylates, ethylene
glycol   (meth)acrylates,      poly(ethylene    glycol)  (meth)acrylates,   ethoxylated     phenol
(meth)acrylates,    alkoxylated polyhydric alcohol (meth)acrylates,            e.g.,   ethoxylated
trimethylol propane triacrylate monomers, urethane (meth)acrylate monomers, such as
those described in U.S. Patent 5,373,033, or a mixture thereof.             Further examples of
polymeric organic host materials are disclosed in the U.S. Patent 5,753,146, column 8,
line 62 to column 10, line 34.
[0293]      With some embodiments, the substrate of the photochromic article of the
present invention is an organic polymeric material, and the organic polymeric material is
                                                 92

chosen from poly(C1-C12 alkyl methacrylates), poly(oxyalkylene dimethacrylates),
poly(alkoxylated phenol methacrylates), cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose
acetate propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, poly(vinyl acetate), poly(vinyl alcohol),
poly(vinyl chloride), poly(vinylidene chloride), thermoplastic polycarbonates, polyesters,
polyurethanes, poly(ethylene terephthalate), polystyrene, poly(alpha methylstyrene),
copoly(styrene-methylmethacrylate), copoly(styrene-acrylonitrile), polyvinylbutyral or is
polymerized from monomers chosen from bis(allyl carbonate) monomers, polyfunctional

glycol) bismethacrylate monomers, ethoxylated phenol bis methacrylate monomers,
alkoxylated polyhydric alcohol polyacrylate monomers, styrene monomers, urethane
acrylate monomers, glycidyl acrylate monomers, glycidyl methacrylate monomers,
diallylidene pentaerythritol monomers or mixtures thereof.
[0294]       With some further non-limiting embodiments, transparent copolymers and
blends of transparent polymers are also suitable as polymeric materials.          The host
material can be an optically clear polymerized organic material prepared from a
thermoplastic polycarbonate resin, such as the carbonate-linked resin derived from
bisphenol A and phosgene, which is sold under the trademark, LEXAN; a polyester,
such as the material sold under the trademark, MYLAR; a poly(methyl methacrylate),
such as the material sold under the trademark, PLEXIGLAS; polymerizates of a
polyol(allyl carbonate) monomer, especially diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate), which
monomer is sold under the trademark CR-39, and polymerizates of copolymers of a
polyol (allyl    carbonate),  e.g.,  diethylene glycol bis(allyl    carbonate), with other
copolymerizable monomeric materials, and copolymers with a polyurethane having
terminal diacrylate functionality, as described in U.S. Patents 4,360,653 and 4,994,208;
and copolymers with aliphatic urethanes, the terminal portion of which contain allyl or
acrylyl functional groups, as described in U.S. Patent 5,200,483.
[0295]       In accordance with some further non-limiting embodiments, the photochromic
materials (b) of the present invention and other optional photochromic materials (c) are
used with optical organic resin monomers to produce optically clear coatings, films and
polymerizates, e.g., materials suitable for optical applications, such as for example plano
and ophthalmic lenses, windows, and automotive transparencies.            Examples of non
                                              93

limiting embodiments include polymerizates of optical resins sold by PPG Industries, Inc.
as TRIVEX monomers and under the CR- designation, e.g., CR-307, CR-407 and CR
607 and the resins used to prepare hard or soft contact lenses. Methods for producing
both types of contact lenses are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,166,345, column 11, line
52, to column 12, line 52.
[0296]       Further non-limiting embodiments of optical resins include the resins used to
form soft contact lenses with high moisture content described in U.S. Patent No.
5,965,630 and extended wear contact lenses described in U.S. Patent No. 5,965,631.
[0297]       With some embodiments, the photochromic article of the present invention,
further includes a phase-separated polymer that includes: a matrix phase that is at least
partially ordered; and a guest phase that is at least partially ordered. The guest phase
includes the photochromic material or compound, and the photochromic material or
compound is at least partially aligned with at least a portion of the guest phase. With
some embodiments: (i) the substrate of the photochromic article includes the phase
separated polymer; and/or (ii) one or more films or layers residing over at least a portion
of at least one surface of the substrate of the photochromic article includes the phase
separated polymer.
[0298]       In accordance with some further embodiments, the photochromic article
further includes an interpenetrating polymer network that includes: an anisotropic
material that is at least partially ordered; and a polymeric material.      The anisotropic
material includes the photochromic material, and the photochromic material is at least
partially aligned with at least a portion of the anisotropic material. With some additional
embodiments: (i) the substrate of the photochromic article includes the interpenetrating
polymer network; and/or (ii) one or more films or layers residing over at least a portion of
at least one surface of the substrate of the photochromic article includes the the
interpenetrating polymer network.
[0299]       As used herein the term "anisotropic" means having at least one property that
differs in value when measured in at least one different direction.            Accordingly,
"anisotropic materials" are materials that have at least one property that differs in value
when measured in at least one different direction. Non-limiting examples of anisotropic
materials that can be included in the photochromic articles of the present invention
include, but are not limited to, art-recognized liquid crystal polymers, liquid crystal pre
polymers, liquid crystal monomers, and liquid crystal mesogens.
                                               94

[0300]       With some embodiments, the photochromic article includes, such as in a film
or layer thereof: (i) liquid crystal oligomers and/or polymers prepared at least in part from
the monomeric mesogenic compounds; and/or (ii) the mesogenic compounds, in each
case as disclosed in Table 1 of United States Patent No. 7,910,019 B2 at columns 43-90
thereof, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.
[0301]       In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, the
photochromic material is a photochromic-dichroic compound, and can be at least
partially aligned by interaction with the anisotropic material, which itself is at least
partially ordered.    For example, although not limiting herein, at least a portion of the
photochromic-dichroic compound can be aligned such that the long-axis of the
photochromic-dichroic compound in the dichroic state is essentially parallel to the
general direction of the anisotropic material.          Further, although not required, the
photochromic-dichroic compound can be bound to or reacted with at least a portion of
the at least partially ordered anisotropic material.
[0302]       Methods of ordering, or introducing order into, the anisotropic material of the
photochromic article include, but are not limited to, exposing the anisotropic material to
at least one of a magnetic field, an electric field, linearly polarized ultraviolet radiation,
linearly polarized infrared radiation, linearly polarized visible radiation, and a shear force.
Alternatively or additionally, the anisotropic material can be at least partially ordered by
aligning at least a portion of the anisotropic material with another material or structure.
For example, the anisotropic material can be at least partially ordered by aligning the
anisotropic material with an alignment layer (or an orientation facility).
[0303]       By ordering at least a portion of the anisotropic material, it is possible to at
least partially align at least a portion of the photochromic-dichroic compound that is
contained within or otherwise connected to the anisotropic material of the photochromic
article.  Although not required, the photochromic-dichroic compound can be at least
partially aligned while in an activated state. With some embodiments, ordering of the
anisotropic material and/or aligning the photochromic-dichroic compound can occur prior
to, during, or after application of a layer containing the photochromic-dichroic compound
over the substrate of the photochromic artice of the present invention.
[0304]       The photochromic-dichroic compound and the anisotropic material can be
aligned and ordered during formation of the photochromic article of the present
invention, such as during application of a photochromic-dichroic layer over the substrate.
                                               95

With some embodiments, the photochromic-dichroic layer can be applied using a coating
technique that introduces a shear force to the anisotropic material during application,
such that the anisotropic material becomes at least partially ordered generally parallel to
the direction of the applied shear force.         For purposes of non-limiting illustration, a
solution or mixture (optionally in a solvent or carrier) including the photochromic-dichroic
compound and the anisotropic material can be curtain coated over the substrate, such
that shear forces are introduced to the materials being applied due to relative movement
of the surface of the substrate with respect to the materials being applied. The shear
forces can cause at least a portion of the anisotropic material to be ordered in a general
direction that is substantially parallel to the direction of the movement of the surface. As
discussed above, by ordering at least a portion of the anisotropic material in this manner,
at least a portion of the photochromic-dichroic compound can be aligned.            In addition,
and optionally, by exposing at least a portion of the photochromic-dichroic compound to
actinic radiation during the curtain coating process, so as to convert the photochromic
dichroic compound to an activated state, at least partial alignment of the photochromic
dichroic compound while in the activated state can also be achieved.
[0305]       The photochromic-dichroic compound and the anisotropic material can be
aligned and ordered after formation of the photochromic article of the present invention,
such as after application of a photochromic-dichroic layer over the substrate.               For
example, a solution or mixture of the photochromic-dichroic compound and the
anisotropic material (optionally in a solvent or carrier) can be spin-coated over at least a
portion of the substrate. Thereafter, at least a portion of the anisotropic material can be
ordered, for example, by exposing the anisotropic material to a magnetic field, an electric
field, linearly polarized ultraviolet radiation, linearly polarized infrared radiation, linearly
polarized visible radiation, and/or a shear force.          Alternatively or additionally, the
anisotropic material can be at least partially ordered by alignment thereof with another
material or structure, such as an alignment layer.
[0306]       The photochromic-dichroic compound and the anisotropic material can be
aligned and ordered prior to formation of the photochromic article of the present
invention, such as prior to application of a photochromic-dichroic layer over the
substrate.    For example, a solution or mixture (optionally in a solvent or carrier) of the
photochromic-dichroic compound and the anisotropic material can be applied over an
ordered polymeric sheet to form a layer thereover. Thereafter, at least a portion of the
                                                96

anisotropic material can be allowed to align with the underlying ordered polymeric sheet.
The polymeric sheet can be subsequently applied over the substrate by, for example,
art-recognized laminating or bonding methods. Alternatively, the ordered photochromic
dichroic layer can be transferred from the polymeric sheet to / over the substrate by
art-recognized method, such as hot stamping.
[0307]       With    some     embodiments,     the    photochromic     article includes    a
phase-separated polymer that includes: a matrix phase; and a guest phase distributed in
the matrix phase.      The matrix phase can include an at least partially ordered liquid
crystal polymer. The guest phase can include the at least partially ordered anisotropic
material and at least a portion of the photochromic-dichroic compound, which can be at
least partially aligned.   The at least partially aligned photochromic-dichroic compound
can be at least partially aligned by interaction with the at least partially ordered
anisotropic material. With some embodiments, the photochromic article includes a film
or layer residing over at least a portion of at least one surface of the substrate, in which
the film / layer includes the phase-separate polymer.
[0308]       With some embodiments, a phase-separating polymer system including, a
matrix phase forming material that includes a liquid crystal material, and a guest phase
forming material that includes the anisotropic material and the photochromic-dichroic
compound, is applied over the substrate of the photochromic article of the present
invention. After applying the phase-separating polymer system, at least portion of the
liquid crystal material of the matrix phase and at least a portion of the anisotropic
material of the guest phase are at least partially ordered, such that at least a portion of
the photochromic-dichroic compound is aligned with at least a portion of the at least
partially ordered anisotropic material of the guest phase. Methods of ordering the matrix
phase forming material and the guest phase forming material of the phase-separating
polymer system include, but are not limited to, exposing the applied layer to at least one
of:    a magnetic field, an electric field, linearly polarized infrared radiation, linearly
polarized ultraviolet radiation, linearly polarized visible radiation, and a shear force.
Alternatively or additionally, ordering the matrix phase forming material and the guest
phase forming material can include alignment thereof by interaction with an underlying
alignment layer.
[0309]       After ordering the matrix phase forming material and the guest phase forming
material, the guest phase forming material can be separated from the matrix phase
                                              97

forming material by polymerization induced phase separation and/or solvent induced
phase separation.      Although the separation of the matrix and guest phase forming
materials is described herein in relation to the guest phase forming material separating
from the matrix phase forming material, it should be appreciated that this language is
intended to cover any separation between the two phase forming materials. That is, this
language is intended to cover separation of the guest phase forming material from the
matrix phase forming material and separation of the matrix phase forming material from
the guest phase forming material, as well as, simultaneous separation of both phase
forming materials and any combination thereof.
[0310]      According to some embodiments, the matrix phase forming material can
include a liquid crystal material chosen form liquid crystal monomers, liquid crystal pre
polymers, and liquid crystal polymers. The guest phase forming material can, with some
embodiments, include a liquid crystal material chosen from liquid crystal mesogens,
liquid crystal monomers, and liquid crystal polymers and pre-polymers.
[0311]      With some embodiments, the phase-separating polymer system can include,
a mixture of a matrix phase forming material that includes a liquid crystal monomer, a
guest    phase forming      material that includes    liquid crystal   mesogens and    the
photochromic-dichroic compound.       With such embodiments, causing the guest phase
forming material to separate from the matrix phase forming material can include
polymerization induced phase-separation.      Typically, the liquid crystal monomer of the
matrix phase can be polymerized and thereby separated from at least a portion of the
liquid crystal    mesogens    of the guest phase forming         material.    Examples of
polymerization methods include, but are not limited to, photo-induced polymerization and
thermally-induced polymerization.
[0312]      With some further embodiments, the phase-separating polymer system can
include, a mixture of a matrix phase forming material that includes a liquid crystal
monomer, a guest phase forming material that includes a low viscosity liquid crystal
monomer having a different functionality from the liquid crystal monomer of the matrix
phase, and the photochromic-dichroic compound.             As used herein, the term "low
viscosity liquid crystal monomer," refers to a liquid crystal monomer mixture or solution
that is freely flowing at room temperature. Typically, causing the guest phase forming
material to separate from the matrix phase forming material includes polymerization
induced phase-separation. For example, at least a portion of the liquid crystal monomer
                                            98

of the matrix phase can be polymerized under conditions that do not cause the liquid
crystal monomer of the guest phase to polymerize. During polymerization of the matrix
phase forming material, the guest phase forming material typically separates from the
matrix phase forming material.       Thereafter, the liquid crystal monomer of the guest
phase forming material can be polymerized in a separate polymerization process.
[0313]       The phase-separating polymer system can include, with some embodiments,
a solution in at least one common solvent of a matrix phase forming material that
includes a liquid crystal polymer, a guest phase forming material that includes a liquid
crystal polymer that is different from the liquid crystal polymer of the matrix phase
forming material, and the photochromic-dichroic compound.         Causing the guest phase
forming material to separate from the matrix phase forming material typically includes
solvent induced phase-separation. Typically, at least a portion of the common solvent is
evaporated from the mixture of liquid crystal polymers, thereby causing the two phases
to separate from each other.
[0314]       With   further   embodiments,     the   photochromic      article  includes an
interpenetrating polymer network. The at least partially ordered anisotropic material and
a polymeric material can form an interpenetrating polymer network, in which at least a
portion of the polymeric material interpenetrates with at least a portion of the at least
partially ordered anisotropic material. As used herein the term "interpenetrating polymer
network" means an entangled combination of polymers, at least one of which is cross
linked, that are not bonded to each other.             Thus, as used herein, the term
interpenetrating polymer network includes semi-interpenetrating polymer networks. For
example, see L.H. Sperling, Introduction to Physical Polymer Science, John Wiley &
Sons, New York (1986) at page 46. In addition, at least a portion of the at least one at
least partially aligned photochromic-dichroic compound can be at least partially aligned
with the at least partially ordered anisotropic material.       Still further, the polymeric
material can be isotropic or anisotropic, provided that, on the whole, the photochromic
article (or a photochromic-dichroic layer residing over the substrate) is anisotropic.
[0315]       According to some embodiments, the anisotropic material can be adapted to
allow the photochromic-dichroic compound to switch from a first state to a second state
at a desired rate.     In general, conventional photochromic compounds can undergo a
transformation from one isomeric form to another in response to actinic radiation, with
each isomeric form having a characteristic absorption spectrum.            The photochromic
                                             99

dichroic compounds of the photochromic articles of the present invention undergo a
similar isomeric transformation, with some embodiments. Without intending to be bound
by any theory, the rate or speed at which this isomeric transformation (and the reverse
transformation) occurs depends, in part, upon the properties of the local environment
surrounding the photochromic-dichroic compound (i.e., the "host"). Although not limiting
herein, it is believed based on the evidence at hand that the rate of transformation of the
photochromic-dichroic compound depends, in part, upon the flexibility of the chain
segments of the host, and more particularly on the mobility or viscosity of the chain
segments of the host. Correspondingly it is believed, without intending to be bound by
any theory, that the rate of transformation of the photochromic-dichroic compound is
generally faster in hosts having flexible chain segments than in hosts having stiff or rigid
chain segments.       As such, and in accordance with some embodiments, when the
anisotropic material is a host, the anisotropic material can be adapted to allow the
photochromic-dichroic compound to transform between various isomeric states at
desired rates. For example, the anisotropic material can be adapted by adjusting the
molecular weight and/or the crosslink density of the anisotropic material.
[0316]       With    some     embodiments,      the   photochromic      article   includes   a
phase-separated polymer that includes a matrix phase including a liquid crystal polymer,
and guest phase distributed within the matrix phase. The phase-separated polymer can
reside in or define a film or layer residing over at leat a portion of at least one surface of
the substrate, with some embodiments.         The guest phase can include the anisotropic
material. Typically, a majority of the photochromic-dichroic compound can be contained
within the guest phase of the phase-separated polymer.             As previously discussed,
because the transformation rate of the photochromic-dichroic compound depends, in
part, on the host in which it is contained, the rate of transformation of the photochromic
dichroic compound depends, substantially, on the properties of the guest phase, with
some embodiments.
[0317]       In accordance with some further embodiments, the present invention relates
to a method for producing a photochromic article adapted to retain at least 12 percent of
the delta OD measured in the Outdoor Test when tested in the Behind the Windshield
Test, which method includes:
                 a)      providing a substrate;
                                              100

                      b)    providing at least one photochromic material (b) as described
previously herein;
                      c)    combining the photochromic material together with the substrate
by a method chosen from:
                            i)      introducing photochromic material (b) with the starting
materials used to form said substrate;
                            ii)     at least partially imbibing photochromic material (b) into at
least one surface of said substrate;
                            iii)    applying at least a partial coating of a polymeric coating
composition comprising photochromic material (b) to at least one surface of the
substrate;
                            iv)     at least partially connecting a superstrate comprising
photochromic material (b) to at least one surface of said substrate; or
                            v)      combinations of i), ii), ii) or iv).
[0318]           The introducing, imbibing, coating application, and superstrate connection
steps are, with some embodiments, each independently as described previously herein.
[0319]           With some further embodiments, the above method further includes adding a
photochromic material (c) that is different from photochromic material (b), in step (c) (i),
(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v).
[0320]           With some further embodiments, the above method further includes adding a
fixed tint dye in (c) (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v). The fixed tint dye can be used alone or in
combination with one or more optional further photochromic materials (c).
[0321]           The photochromic articles prepared by the aforementioned methods can be
substantially free of ultraviolet radiation absorbing materials adapted to substantially
inhibit the activation of the photochromic material by radiation below 380 nm.
[0322]           The photochromic articles of the present invention can be used in, as, or in
conjunction with various applications including, but not limited to, optical lenses, such as
vision correcting ophthalmic lenses and plano lenses, face shields, goggles, visors,
camera          lenses,   windows,      automotive      windshields,     aircraft and automotive
transparencies, such as T-roofs, sidelights and backlights, polymeric coatings, plastic
films and sheets, textiles, security verification articles, such as security documents that
include verification marks including photochromic material (b) (e.g., documents such as
                                                    101

banknotes, passports and drivers' licenses for which authentication or verification of
authenticity may be desired).

examples, which are intended as illustrative only, since numerous modifications and
variations therein will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

Part 4: Preparation of the topcoat layer formulation (TLF)
A topcoat layer formulation (TLF) was from the material and quantities as described in
paragraphs [0505] through [0514] of U.S Patent Application No. 13/296,867, Publication
No. 2012/0120473A1 (published May 17, 2012), the cited portions of which are
incorporated by reference herein. The cited materials were stirred at room temperature
for two hours in a 50mL amber glass bottle equipped with a magnetic stir-bar.
Part 5:-Procedures Used for Preparing Substrate and Coating Stacks
Substrate Preparation
Finished single vision lenses (6 base, 70 mm) prepared from CR-39@ monomer were
used as substrates. Each substrate was cleaned by wiping with a tissue soaked with
acetone and dried with a stream of air and corona treated by passing on a conveyor belt
in Tantec EST Systems Serial No. 020270 Power Generator HV 2000 series corona
treatment equipment with a high voltage transformer. The substrates were exposed to
                                              105

corona generated by 53.99 KV, 500 Watts while traveling on a conveyor at a belt speed
3 ft/min.
Coating Procedure for the Primer Layer
The PLF was applied to the test substrates by spin-coating on a portion of the surface of
the test substrate by dispensing approximately 1.5 mL of the solution. A spin processor
from Laurell Technologies Corp. (WS-400B-6NPP/LITE) was used for spin coating the
substrates at 976 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 4 seconds, followed by 1501 rpm for 2
seconds, followed by 2500 rpm for 1 second. Afterwards, the coated substrates were
placed in an oven maintained at 125 0 C for 60 minutes. The coated substrates were
cooled to 26 0 C. The substrate was corona treated by passing on a conveyor belt in
Tantec EST Systems Serial No. 020270 Power Generator HV 2000 series corona
treatment equipment with a high voltage transformer. The dried primer layers were
exposed to corona generated by 53.00 KV, 500 Watts while traveling on a conveyor at a
belt speed 3 ft/min.
Coating Procedure for the Liquid Crystal Alignment Layer
The LCAF was applied to the test substrates by spin-coating on a portion of the surface
of the test substrate by dispensing approximately 1.0 mL of the solution and spinning the
substrates at 800 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 3 seconds, followed by 1,000 rpm for
7 seconds, followed by 2,500 rpm for 4 seconds. A spin processor from Laurell
Technologies Corp. (WS-4006-6NPP/LITE) was used for spin coating. Afterwards, the
coated substrates were placed in an oven maintained at 120 0 C for 30 minutes. The
coated substrates were cooled to 26 0 C.
The dried photoalignment layer on each of the substrates was at least partially ordered
by exposure to linearly polarized ultraviolet radiation. The light source was oriented such
that the radiation was linearly polarized in a plane perpendicular to the surface of the
substrate. The amount of ultraviolet radiation that each photoalignment layer was
exposed to was measured using a UV Power PuckTM High energy radiometer from EIT
Inc (Serial No. 2066) and was as follows: UVA 0.018 W/cm 2 and 5.361 J/cm 2 ; UVB 0
W/cm 2 and 0 J/cm 2 ; UVC 0 W/cm 2 and 0 J/cm 2 ; and UVV 0.005 W/cm 2 and 1.541 J/cm 2.
                                             106

After ordering at least a portion of the photo-orientable polymer network, the substrates
were cooled to 260C and kept covered.
Coating Procedure for the Coating Layer
The CLFs from Part 3 were each spin coated at a rate of 400 revolutions per minute
(rpm) for 6 seconds, followed by 800 rpm for 6 seconds onto the at least partially
ordered photoalignment materials on the test substrates. Each coated substrate was
placed in an oven at 600C for 30 minutes. They were then cured under two ultraviolet
lamps in the UV Curing Oven Machine designed and built by Belcan Engineering under
a Nitrogen atmosphere while running on a conveyor belt at 2 ft/min speed. The coated
substrates were subjected to a peak intensity of 0.388 Watts/cm2 of UVA and 0.165
Watts/cm2 of UVV and UV dosage of 7.386 Joules/cm2 of UVA and 3.337 Joules/cm 2 of
UVV. Coated substrates which were to receive a topcoat layer were subsequently
exposed to corona generated by 53.00 KV, 500 Watts while traveling on a conveyor at a
belt speed 3 ft/min. Coated substrates which were not to receive a topcoat layer were
further cured at 105 0 C for 3 hours.
Coating Procedure for the Topcoat Layer
The TLF was spin coated at a rate of 1,400 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 7 seconds
onto the cured CLF coated substrates. Afterwards the substrates were cured under two
ultraviolet lamps in the UV Curing Oven Machine designed and built by Belcan
Engineering under a Nitrogen atmosphere while running on a conveyor belt at 6 ft/min
speed. The topcoated substrates were subjected to a peak intensity of 1.887 Watts/cm2
of UVA and 0.694 Watts/cm2 of UVV and UV dosage of 4.699 Joules/cm2 of UVA and
1.787 Joules/cm2 of UVV. Post curing was completed at 105 0 C for 3 hours. Table 4 lists
the coating stacks fabricated for testing below. An "X" in the columns of Table 4
indicates the presence of the specified layer in a given Example. The CLF from Part 3
used for each example is listed in the appropriate column.

Part 6- Photochromic Property Testing
Part 6A - Outdoor Simulation (OS) Testing
The photochromic samples prepared as described in Parts 1-5 were tested for
photochromic response in the Outdoor Simulation (OS) Test as described herein on an
Advance Bench for Measuring Photochromics (A-BMP) custom made by PPG. Prior to
testing on the A-BMP, the photochromic samples were conditioned by activating and
fading as described hereinafter. The test samples were first exposed to 365 nanometer
ultraviolet light for approximately 10 minutes at a distance of 14 centimeters to activate
the photochromic compounds. The UVA (315 to 380 nm) irradiance at the sample was
measured with a Licor Model Li-1 800 spectroradiometer and found to be 22.2 watts per
square meter. The activated samples were then placed under a 500 watt, high intensity
halogen lamp for approximately 10 minutes at a distance of 36 centimeters to bleach or
inactivate the photochromic compounds. The illuminance at the sample was measured
with the Licor spectroradiometer and found to be 21.4 Klux. The test samples were then
kept covered for at least 1 hour prior to testing on an A-BMP.
The A-BMP was fitted with two 150 watt Xenon arc lamps positioned 900 apart (one
lamp to provide the amount of UVNIS light (Lamp 1) and one to provide the additional
                                              108

contribution of visible light (Lamp 2)). The collimated output beams from the Xenon arc
lamps were combined and directed toward the sample cell through a 50/50 beam
splitter. Each lamp was filtered and shuttered individually and also shuttered after
blending, prior to entering the temperature controlled sample chamber. The light path
from Lamp 1 was directed through a 3 mm Schott KG-2 band-pass filter and appropriate
neutral density filters that contributed to the required UV and partial VIS light irradiance
level. The light path from the Lamp 2 was directed through a 3 mm Schott KG-2 band
pass filter, a 400 nm cutoff filter and neutral density filters in order to provide
supplemental VIS light illuminance. Proprietary software was used on the A-BMP to
control timing, irradiance intensity, sample chamber temperature, shuttering, filter
selection and response measurement. A Zeiss spectrophotometer, Model MCS 601, with
fiber optic cables for light delivery through the sample was used for response and color
measurement. The sample within the sample chamber was controlled at a temperature
of 23+/-0.2oC using an FTS TM Systems AirJet TM XE maintained at 3.5cfm pressure flow
through sample chamber.
Testing was conducted using conditions simulating the average photochromic lens
response on a wearer when outdoors at the specified temperature or a value of 6.7
Watts/m2 (UVA) integrated between 315 and 380 nm and 50 Klux. Response
measurements, in terms of change in optical density (DOD) from the unactivated state to
the activated or darkened state were determined by establishing the initial unactivated
transmittance, opening the shutter from the Xenon lamp(s) and measuring the
transmittance during activation of the sample at selected intervals of time. Change in
optical density was determined according to the formula: DOD=loglO(% Tb/% Ta),
where % Tb is the percent transmittance in the bleached state, % Ta is the percent
transmittance in the activated state. Optical density measurement can be per specific
wavelength or photopic response.
Part 6B - Behind the Windshield (BWS) Response Testing
In a similar fashion, these lenses were tested in the Behind the Windshield (BWS) Test
using the A-BMP described above with conditions simulating photochromic lens
response on a wearer inside an automobile. It was determined that the amount of light
energy available to activate a photochromic lens on a wearer in an automobile was 0.75
Watts/m2 integrated between 380 and 420 nm and 1.7 Klux (kilolumens/m2). These
                                               109

conditions were attained using only Lamp 1 with a direct irradiance path to the sample.
In this irradiance path, the 3 mm Schott KG-2 band-pass filter and a simulated
windshield was used to attain the irradiance spectral profile. The simulated windshield
was prepared by laminating a 0.73 mm thick piece of polyvinylbutyrate film from Solutia
Inc. between two 2.3 mm thick layers of Solex 97 glass from PPG Industries, Inc. The
simulated windshield had a total thickness of 5.33 mm. Test results are recorded below
in Table 5.

The results of Table 5 show that Examples 1-6, when under behind the windshield
eyeglass wearer simulating conditions, retain from 22 to 28 percent of the AOD
measured under outdoor simulating conditions.
Part 7 - Photochromic Performance Tests including Polarization Efficiency and Optical
Response Measurements
Part 7A - Outdoor Simulation with polarization (OSP) Testing
Prior to response testing on an optical bench, the substrates were conditioned by
exposing them to 365 nm ultraviolet light for 10 minutes at a distance of 14 cm from the
source in order to pre-activate the photochromic molecules. The UVA irradiance at the
sample was measured with a Licor Model Li-1 800 spectroradiometer and found to be
22.2 watts per square meter. The samples were then placed under a high intensity
halogen lamp (500 W, 120 V) for approximately 10 minutes at a distance of 36 cm from
                                            110

the lamp in order to bleach, or inactivate, the photochromic compound in the samples.
The illuminance at the sample was measured with the Licor spectroradiometer and
found to be 21.9 Klux. The samples were exposed to yellow fluorescent lamps for 30
minutes to provide further visible light bleaching. The samples were then kept in a dark
environment for at least 1 hour prior to testing in order to cool and continue to fade back
to a ground state.
An optical bench was used to measure the optical properties of the coated substrates
and derive the dichroic ratio and photochromic properties. Each test sample was placed
on the optical bench with an activating light source (a Newport/Oriel Model 66485 300
Watt Xenon arc lamp fitted with a UNIBLITZ@ VS-25 high-speed computer controlled
shutter that momentarily closed during data collection so that stray light would not
interfere with the data collection process, a SCHOTT@ 3 mm KG-2 band-pass filter,
which removed short wavelength radiation, neutral density filter(s) for intensity
attenuation and a condensing lens for beam collimation) positioned at a 300 to 350 angle
of incidence to the surface of the test sample. The arc lamp was equipped with a light
intensity controller (Newport/Oriel model 68950).
A broadband light source for monitoring response measurements was positioned in a
perpendicular manner to a surface of the test sample. Increased signal of shorter visible
wavelengths was obtained by collecting and combining separately filtered light from a
100-Watt tungsten halogen lamp (controlled by a constant voltage powder supply) with a
split-end, bifurcated fiber optical cable. Light from one side of the tungsten halogen lamp
was filtered with a SCHOTT@ KG1 filter to absorb heat and a HOYA@ B-440 filter to
allow passage of the shorter wavelengths. The other side of the light was either filtered
with a SCHOTT@ KG1 filter or unfiltered. The light was collected by focusing light from
each side of the lamp onto a separate end of the split-end, bifurcated fiber optic cable,
and subsequently combined into one light source emerging from the single end of the
cable. A 4" or 6" light pipe was attached to the single end of the cable to insure proper
mixing. The broad band light source was fitted with a UNIBLITZ@ VS-25 high-speed
computer controlled shutter that momentarily opened during data collection.
Polarization of the light source was achieved by passing the light from the single end of
the cable through a Moxtek, PROFLUX@ Polarizer held in a computer driven, motorized
                                              111

rotation stage (Model M-061-PD from Polytech, PI or equivalent). The monitoring beam
was set so that the one polarization plane)(00 ) was perpendicular to the plane of the
optical bench table and the second polarization plane)(90') was parallel to the plane of
the optical bench table. The samples were run in air, at 230C0.1 C maintained by a
temperature controlled air cell.
To align each sample, a second polarizer was added to the optical path. The second
polarizer was set to 900 of the first polarizer. The sample was placed in an air cell in a
self-centering holder mounted on a rotation stage. A laser beam (Coherent-ULN 635
diode laser) was directed through the crossed polarizers and sample. The sample was
rotated (in 30 steps as coarse moves and in 0.10 steps as fine moves) to find the
minimum transmission. At this point the sample was aligned either parallel or
perpendicular to the Moxtek polarizer and the second polarizer as well as the diode laser
beam was removed from the optical path. The sample was aligned within 0.50 prior to
any activation.
To conduct the measurements, each test sample was exposed to 6.7 W/m 2 of UVA from
the activating light source for 10 to 20 minutes to activate the photochromic compound.
An International Light Research Radiometer (Model IL-1700) with a detector system
(Model SED033 detector, B Filter, and diffuser) was used to verify exposure at the
beginning of each day. Light from the monitoring source that was polarized to the 00
polarization plane was then passed through the coated sample and focused into a 1
integrating sphere, which was connected to an OCEAN OPTICS@ S2000
spectrophotometer or equivalent using a single function fiber optic cable. The spectral
information, after passing through the sample, was collected using OCEAN OPTICS@
OOlBase32 and OOIColor software, and PPG propriety software. While the
photochromic material was activated, the position of the polarizing sheet was rotated
back and forth to polarize the light from the monitoring light source to the 900 polarization
plane and back. Data was collected for approximately 600 to 1200 seconds at 5-second
intervals during activation. For each test, rotation of the polarizers was adjusted to
collect data in the following sequence of polarization planes: 00, 900, 900, 00, etc.
Absorption spectra were obtained and analyzed for each test sample using the Igor Pro
software (available from WaveMetrics). The change in the absorbance in each
                                              112

polarization direction for each test sample was calculated by subtracting out the 0 time
(i.e., unactivated) absorption measurement for the samples at each wavelength tested.
Average absorbance values were obtained in the region of the activation profile where
the photochromic response of the photochromic compound was saturated or nearly
saturated (i.e., the regions where the measured absorbance did not increase or did not
increase significantly over time) for each sample by averaging absorbance at each time
interval in this region. The average absorbance values in a predetermined range of
wavelengths corresponding Amax-vis+/-5 nm were extracted for the 00 and 900
polarizations, and the dichroic ratio for each wavelength in this range was calculated by
dividing the larger average absorbance by the small average absorbance. For each
wavelength extracted, 5 to 100 data points were averaged. The average dichroic ratio for
the photochromic compound was then calculated by averaging these individual dichroic
ratios.
The change in optical density (AOD) from the bleached state to the darkened state was
determined as described in Part 6A.
Polarization efficiency (PE) is calculated by taking the fully activated AOD values from
the 0 and 90 degree polarization orientations at the 90 degree lambda max (90 degree
peak absorption position), converting those delta absorbance values to transmission
(1/10A( AOD)) and then performing the following calculation:
PE = 100 * ( (To - Teo) / (To + To) )
Perfect polarization would be 100%, no polarization = 0%, and partial polarization
ranges from >0 to < 100% in this calculation. The basis for this calculation comes from
Optics, Eugene Hecht,     4 th Edition, Addison Wesley, 2002, Chapter 8. Transmission was
substituted for intensity in this calculation.
The fade half life (T%) is the time interval in seconds for the AOD of the activated form of
the photochromic compounds in the test samples to reach one half the AOD measured
after fifteen minutes, or after saturation or near-saturation was achieved, at room
temperature after removal of the source of activating light, e.g., by closing the shutter.

Part 7B - Behind the Windshield with polarization (BWSP) Response Testing
Behind the windshield response testing with polarization efficiency and optical response
is performed in a similar manner as Part 7A - Outdoor Simulation with polarization (OSP)
Testing, with the following modifications: The temperature of the temperature controlled
air cell was set to 27 +/- 0.20C. The temperature dwell time before exposure to UV-VIS
radiation was 2-3 minutes. The relative humidity in the air cell was 20-28% with some
variation within due to room humidity. The activation time was 15 minutes. The activation
exposure (irradiance level) was set to 1.00 +- 0.02 W/m 2 over an integrated wavelength
range of 380 to 420 nm using a WG295, KG-2 (3 mm), Solar Green/PVB windshield
filter, and various neutral density filters and lamp powers to obtain said exposure level.
The visible illuminance (380 to 780 nm) was measured at 4800 +/- 200 lux, though this
level was not controlled. The irradiance was measured using an ILT950 spectral
radiometer from International Light. The output data from the spectral radiometer was
post processed for wavelength correction, such that the wavelength accuracy of the
spectral radiometer was < +/- 1 nm. Test results are recorded below in Table 6.
