RELATED APPLICATIONS
The present application is a divisional application of Patent Application No. 2015205873 which is a
divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. 2010276586, which is the national
phase application in Australia of PCT/US2010/043200 filed 26 July 2010 and which claims priority
from US 12/512,532 filed 30 July 2009. The present application hereby incorporates the entire
contents of each of these named applications.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]            Aspects of the present invention relate to medical devices having a luer slip
mechanism for connection to a fluid storage container.
BACKGROUND
[0002]             Fluid storage containers, such as syringes, having a luer fitting or connection are
often assembled with hubs or luer fittings. Two common mechanisms used to connect the hubs to
the syringes include the "luer lock" and "luer slip" mechanisms.
[0003]            The luer lock mechanism generally includes a fluid storage container with a male
fitting in co-axial relation with an internally threaded collar. A cooperating hub or female luer lock
fittings have external lugs for engaging the internally threaded collar of the male conical fitting,
upon application of a twisting force or torque force to the hub.
[0004]            The luer slip fitting generally includes a fluid storage container with a male fitting
without a threaded collar. Cooperating hubs or female luer slip fittings typically have an internal
surface which slides over the external surface of the male fitting. The hub is attached to the male
fitting in a friction fit or interference fit relationship. To attach the hub to the male fitting, the user
must apply enough force when sliding the hub over the male fitting to create a fluid-tight
relationship between the hub and male fitting. Failure to securely connect the hub and medical
device can result in "pop offs," where the unsecured hub detaches from the male fitting during use.

[0005]           A medical device with a connection mechanism for securely connecting a hub to
fluid storage containers in a luer slip relationship, as defined herein, presents a viable solution to
these issues. In addition, there is a need for a mechanism that indicates such secure connection
between a hub and fluid container.
SUMMARY
[0006]           A first aspect of the present invention pertains to medical devices for use with fluid
storage containers. Medical devices have structure that forms line contact interactions between a
first indicating element of the hub and a second indicating element of the hub when the fluid storage
container is securely connected to the hub. As used herein, the term "line contact" shall include
contact between two surfaces at two or more points, wherein one or both

                                                       2
    of the surfaces are compressible and/or non-compressible. As used herein, the term "surface
    contact" or "point contact" shall include contact between two surfaces at a single point,
    wherein one or both of the surfaces are compressible and/or non-compressible. In one or more
    embodiments, the medical device includes a hub with a distal end with an opening, an open
  5 proximal end and a sidewall extending from the distal end to the proximal end forming a
    cavity. The medical device further includes a first indicating element attached to the distal end
    of the hub extending into the cavity and a second indicating element disposed within the
    cavity. In one or more embodiments, one of either the first indicating element or the second
    indicating element is flexible.
 10 [0007]           In one or more embodiments, the opening of the hub at the distal end is in fluid
    communication with the cavity. The hub may optionally include a needle cannula attached to
    its distal end and extending in the distal direction. The needle cannula used with one or more
    embodiments, includes a proximal end, a distal end and a lumen therethrough in fluid
    communication with the cavity. Alternative embodiments of the hub may include a safety cap
 15 covering the needle cannula. In a specific embodiment, the hub may include a coaxial wall
    extending from the distal end of the hub that forms a channel between the coaxial wall and the
    sidewall of the hub for receiving the safety cap.
    [00081           The first indicating element includes a distal end attached to the distal end of the
    hub and a proximal end that extends into the cavity of the hub. In one or more embodiments,
20  the distal end of the first indicating element surrounds the opening in the distal end of the hub.
    The first indicating element of one or more embodiments forms a recess with the sidewall of
    the hub. The first indicating element may also include an outwardly radially extending
    protrusion. In one or more embodiments the protrusion is disposed on the outside surface of
    the first indicating element and extends into the recess formed between the first indicating
25  element and the sidewall of the hub.
    [0009]           The second indicating element of one or more embodiments includes an open
    proximal end, an open distal end and a body extending from the open proximal end to the open
    distal end. The body includes an inside surface that defines a hollow interior. The body of one
    or more embodiments of the second indicating element may be hollow and cylindrical.
30  [0010]           In one or more embodiments, the hollow interior is sized and shaped to
    envelope or receive the first indicating element. In a more specific embodiment, the hollow
    interior allows the body of the second indicating element to enter the recess formed between

                                                      3
    the first indicating element and the sidewall of the hub. The body of the second indicating
    element enters the recess upon application of a distally directed force on the second indicating
    element. In one or more embodiments, the protrusion of the first indicating element prevents
    the body from entering the recess until a pre-determined distally-directed force is applied to the
  5 second indicating element. In a specific embodiment, the protrusion is shaped and/or adapted
    to advance proximally into the hollow interior of the second indicating element as the body of
    the second indicating element enters the recess.
    [0011]           In accordance with one or more embodiments the inside surface of the second
    indicating element or the cross-sectional width formed by the inside surface is contoured to
 10 form a line contact interaction with the first indicating element upon application of a force on
    the second indicating element in the distal direction. As used herein, the term "cross-sectional
    width" shall include the longest distance between two points on the circumference or edge of
    the cross-section of an object having a circular and non-circular cross-section. The two points
    may be located on the interior or exterior surface circumference or edge of the cross-section of
 15 the object. It should be recognized that "cross-sectional width" of objects having a circular
    cross-section may be referred to as the "diameter" of the object. The terms "cross-sectional
    width" and "diameter" may be used interchangeably for objects having a circular cross-section.
    [0012]           In a specific embodiment, the inside surface includes a first diameter portion
    adjacent to the open distal end of the second indicating element. The inside surface may also
20  include a second diameter portion having an axial length extending from the first diameter
    portion to the open proximal end. In one or more embodiments, the diameter of the inside
    surface increases along the second diameter portion from the first diameter portion toward the
    open proximal end of the second indicating element.
    [0013]           In accordance with one or more embodiments, the second indicating element
25  includes an inside surface defining a cross-sectional width. The inside surface includes a
    tapered portion adjacent to the open distal end of the body, a ramped portion distally adjacent
    to the tapered portion, an enlarged portion adjacent the open proximal end of the body. In one
    or more embodiments, the ramped portion has an axial length extending from the tapered
    diameter portion toward the enlarged portion. In a specific embodiment, the cross-sectional
30  width of the inside surface increases along the axial length of the ramped portion from the
    tapered portion toward the enlarged portion. The second indicating element of one or more
    embodiments is adapted to slide distally over the first indicating element, as will be described

                                                        4
    herein. In a specific embodiment, the ramped portion of the inside surface of the second
    indicating element forms a line contact interaction with the first indicating element as the
    second indicating element receives the first indicating element. In a more specific
    embodiment, the axial length of the ramped portion may be reduced to provide tactile feedback
  5 upon fluid-tight engagement of a fluid storage container and a hub.
    [0014]           The second indicating element with a tapered portion may be utilized with a
    first indicating element having a protrusion shaped and/or adapted to slide proximally past the
    tapered portion upon application of a pre-determined force on the second indicating element in
    a distal direction relative to the first indicating element. Alternatively, the protrusion may be
 [0 shaped and/or adapted to prevent the second indicating element from engaging the first
    indicating element or sliding distally over the first indicating element until a pre-determined
    force is applied to the second indicating element in a proximal direction relative to the first
    indicating element.
    [00151           The open distal end of one or more embodiments of the second indicating
 [5 element includes a continuous or solid perimeter. In one or more embodiments, the continuous
    or solid perimeter has a circular form that is maintained upon application of a distally directed
    force on the second indicating element until the hub and the fluid container are in fluid-tight
    engagement.
    [0016]           One or more embodiments of the medical devices described herein may
20  incorporate means for indicating application of a force on the hub sufficient to result in fluid
    tight engagement of the hub with a fluid storage device. In accordance with one or more
    embodiments, the means forms at least two contact points with the hub. For example, the hub
    may include a first indicating element at its distal end extending proximally into the cavity
    from the opening and the means forms at least two contact points with the second indicating
25  element during application of the force on the hub. In one or more embodiments the first
    indicating element may also include a radially extending protrusion and the means for
    indicating comprises a hollow cylindrical body having a proximal end, a distal end and an
    inside surface extending from the proximal end to the distal end that has a diameter that
    increases from the distal end to the proximal end. In a specific embodiment, the hollow
30  cylindrical body has a circular cross-section that maintains its circular shape during application
    of the required force on the hub. In a more specific embodiment, the means for indicating
    produces tactile feedback upon fluid-tight engagement of the hub and the fluid storage device.

                                                       5
    [0017]          A second aspect of the present invention pertains to a feature that includes a
    visual indicator. The visual indicator may be used with one or more embodiments of the
    medical device described herein. The visual indicator is disposed on a fluid storage device, for
    example, adjacent to the opening of the fluid storage device. In one or more embodiments, the
  5 fluid storage device includes a syringe barrel with a luer tip and the visual indicator is disposed
    on the tip. In alternative embodiments, the fluid storage device includes a male luer connector
    and the visual indicator is disposed on the male luer connector. The visual indicator is
    disposed at a location on the tip such that it is fully visible prior to fluid-tight engagement of
    the fluid-transfer device and the medical device or hub of the medical device. The first
 10 predefined portion of the visual indicator is also visible when the connection between the fluid
    storage device and the medical device is under tightened. In accordance with one or more
    embodiments, a second predefined portion which is less than the first predefined portion of the
    visual indicator is visible upon optimal lightening and/or fluid-tight engagement of the fluid
    storage device and the hub. In a specific embodiment, the visual indicator is not visible when
 15 the connection between the fluid storage device and the hub is over tightened. The fluid
    storage devices described herein may be utilized with one or more embodiments of the medical
    devices described herein regardless of whether the medical device utilizes the visual indication
    feature.

    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    [0042]            Before describing several exemplary embodiments of the invention, it is to be
    understood that the invention is not limited to the details of construction or process steps set
    forth in the following description. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being
  5 practiced or being carried out in various ways.
    [0043]            One aspect of the present invention provides for a medical device assembly that
    may be connected or attached in fluid-tight engagement with a fluid storage container. The
    medical device assembly of one or more embodiments may utilize a first indicating element
    and/or a second indicating element as a means for indicating fluid-tight engagement with a
 10 fluid storage container. One or more embodiments of the medical device assembly include a
    hub and means for indicating application of a force on the hub sufficient to result in fluid tight
    engagement with a fluid storage container. The means for indicating may be utilized during
    engagement of the medical device assembly and the fluid storage container in a luer slip
    configuration. The embodiments of the medical device assemblies described herein may be
 15 used with an optional needle cannula and/or an optional needle tip cap.
    [0044]            Figures 1-21 illustrate a medical device assembly according to one or more
    embodiments. It will be understood that medical device assembly may be used with fluid
    storage containers such as syringe barrels, needleless IV sets, or other devices that can be used
    to store and/or transfer medication or other liquid. In one or more embodiments, the fluid
20  storage container includes an opening providing access to the contents of the container, The
    opening may include a male luer fitting or may be otherwise configured for use with the
    medical device assembly.
    [0045]            Figures 1-21 illustrate a medical device assembly according to the invention,
    including a hub 160 having means for indicating application of a force on the hub sufficient to
25  result in fluid tight engagement with a fluid storage container 140. In one or more
    embodiments, the means for indicating application of such a force forms at least two contact
    points with the hub during application of the force. In one or more embodiments, the means
    for indicating application of such a force includes a first indicating element 170 attached to or
    integrally formed with the hub and/or a second indicating element 180 disposed within the hub
30  160.
    [0046]            Figures 1-7 show an embodiment of the medical device assembly that includes
    an optional needle cannula 132 attached to a hub 160. Figure 1-7 also show an optional fluid

                                                      8
    storage container 140 in the form of a syringe barrel attached to the hub to form a fluid
    delivery system 100. In one or more embodiments, the fluid storage container 140 has a
    sidewall 142 with an inside surface 144 that defines a chamber 146 for holding the contents of
    the container, which may include medication. The container 140 includes an open proximal
  5 end 141 and a distal end 149 and a distal wall 148. The distal wall 148 includes a luer tip 150
    having an opening 152 in fluid communication with the chamber 146. The fluid storage
    container 140 may include a plunger rod 120 inserted into the proximal end 141 of the fluid
    storage container 140. It is to be understood that the configuration shown is merely exemplary,
    and the components can be different in shape and size than shown.
 10 [0047]          The hub 160 shown more clearly in Figure 9A includes an open proximal end
    161 and a distal end 169 that includes the optional needle cannula 132 having a lumen 134
    therethrough. The hub 160 includes a sidewall 164 extending from the distal end 169 toward
    the open proximal end 161 and defining a cavity 166. The distal end 169 includes a
    passageway 130 therethrough in fluid communication with the lumen 134 of the optional
 15 needle cannula 132. As more clearly shown in Figure 10, a second indicating element 180 is
    disposed within the cavity 166 of the hub 160.
    [0048]          The distal end 169 of the hub 160 further includes a first indicating element 170
    having a distal end 179 attached to the distal end 169 of the hub 160 and a free proximal end
    171 extending proximally into the cavity 166. In a specific embodiment, the first indicating
20  element 170 is permanently attached to the distal end 169 of the hub. In a more specific
    embodiment, the first indicating element 170 is integrally formed with the hub 160. In an
    alternative embodiment, the first indicating element 170 is a separate component that may be
    attached or affixed to the distal end 169 of the hub. The first indicating element 170 of one or
    more embodiments is substantially free of threads and forms an interference fit engagement
25  with the second indicating element 180, as will be more fully described below. The first
    indicating element 170 forms a recess 163 with the sidewall 164. The recess 163 may extend
    from the distal end 169 of the hub to the free proximal end 171 of the first indicating element
    170. In one or more embodiments, the first indicating element may be in the form of a second
    sidewall formed coaxially with the sidewall 164 of the hub, forming peripheral recess with the
30  sidewall 164 of the hub. In a specific embodiment, the coaxially formed second sidewall may
    encircle or surround the passageway 130. In a more specific embodiment, the first indicating

                                                      9
    element may include a cantilevered beam attached to the distal end 169 of the hub adjacent to
    the passageway 130 and extending into the cavity 166.
    [0049]          The recess 163 is shaped to receive the second indicating element 180 when the
    hub is attached to a fluid storage container. The first indicating element 170 includes at least
  5 one protrusion 175 extending radially outwardly from the outer surface of the first indicating
    element 170 into the recess 163. The protrusion 175 may be a single extending portion or may
    be a ridge formed concentrically around the first indicating element 170. In one or more
    embodiments, the location of the protrusion may be modified to indicate fluid tight connection
    with fluid storage containers having different shapes and for use with second indicating
 10 elements 180 with different sizes and shapes.
    [00501          In the alternative embodiment shown in Figure 9B, the medical device of the
    invention may include a hub 260 with a needle cannula 132 wherein the hub 260 is configured
    to incorporate one or more components to prevent contamination and accidental sticking and/or
    to protect the needle cannula 132, such as a needle tip cap (not shown). The hub 260 includes
 15 a distal end 269 with a passageway 230 therethrough, an open proximal end 261, and a
    sidewall 264 extending from the distal end 269 and the proximal end 261 that defines a cavity
    266. The hub 260 includes first indicating element 270 for indicating fluid-tight engagement
    between the hub 260 and a fluid storage container. The hub 260 includes a coaxial wall 267
    formed around the sidewall 264 at the distal end 269. The coaxial wall 267 forms a channel
20  268 for receiving a needle tip cap (not shown).
    [0051]          The needle cannula 132 may be made of various materials known in the art,
    including metals such as stainless steel, and may be held in the hub 160 or 260 using known
    manufacturing methods. For example, adhesives may be used to hold the needle. The hub may
    be manufactured using known methods such as injection molding and may be made of
25  injection moldable plastic such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polycarbonate and
    combinations thereof. The needle cannula and hub may also be integrally formed of
    thermoplastic material. The sidewall 164 of the hub may also be shaped to attach to a variety
    of fluid storage containers.
    [0052]          The shape of the hub may be modified to form an interference fit with a selected
30  fluid storage container in a luer slip configuration. For example, the hub may be shaped to
    have a frusto-conical shape to form a luer slip configuration with the tip of a fluid storage
    container (as shown in Figures 9-17). The hub may also be shaped to be used with standard

                                                       10
    luer slip fittings or other luer fittings known in the art. In one or more embodiments, the
    sidewall 164 of the hub 160 may be free of any threads for engagement with the fluid storage
    container in a luer lock configuration.
    [0053]           As shown more clearly in Figures 10-17, the second indicating element 180 is
  5 disposed within the cavity 166 of the hub 160. Referring to Figures 4-7, the second indicating
    element 180 includes an open proximal end 181 and an open distal end 189. The second
    indicating element 180 also includes a hollow body 182 having an axial length and an inside
    surface 184 defining a hollow interior 186 extending from the distal end 189 to the proximal
    end 181. In one or more embodiments, the second indicating element 180 is shaped and
 10 positioned to ensure or to facilitate fluid-tight engagement of the hub 160 and a fluid storage
    container. In a specific embodiment, the second indicating element 180 is positioned within
    the cavity 166 of the hub 160 so that when the hub 160 is placed over the opening of a fluid
    storage container, for example, the tip 150 of a fluid storage container 140, the proximal end
    181 of the second indicating element 180 abuts the tip 150, while the distal end 189 of the
 15 second indicating element 180 is adjacent to and/or contacts the proximal end 171 of the first
    indicating element 170, as more clearly shown in Figures 10-11.
    [0054]           In one or more embodiments, during assembly, the tip 150 is disposed adjacent
    to the proximal end 181 of the second indicating element 180 and does not enter the hollow
    interior 186 of the second indicating element 180 during assembly of the fluid storage
20  container 140 and the hub 160. In accordance with one or more embodiments, the second
    indicating element 180 is shaped and configured to require a user to apply a pre-determined
    force on the hub 160 in the proximal direction toward the fluid storage container 140 or a pre
    determined force on the fluid storage container 140 in the distal direction toward the hub 160
    to allow the second indicating element 180 to advance distally over the first indicating element
25  170 and the protrusion 175 disposed on the outer surface of the first indicating element 170, as
    shown in Figures 10-17. Application of this pre-determined force results in the displacement
    of the second indicating element 180 within the cavity 166 into the recess 163, thereby
    indicating the point at which the hub 160 and the tip 150 form a fluid-tight engagement.
    [0055]           In accordance with one or more embodiments, the protrusion 175 is disposed on
30  the outer surface of the first indicating element 170 and may be modified in shape and location
    to adjust the pre-determined force required to form a fluid-tight engagement between the hub
    160 and the tip 150. For example, the height of the protrusion 175 may be increased to

                                                     11
    increase the total amount of force needed to be applied on the hub 160 and/or the fluid storage
    container 140 to form a fluid-tight engagement between the hub 160 and the tip 150. The
    increased height of the protrusion 170 increases resistance to advancement of the second
    indicating element 180 in the distal direction over the first indicating element 170. This
  5 increased resistance indicates to the user that more force is required to form such engagement
    between the hub 160 and the tip 150. Advancement of the second indicating element 180 into
    the recess 163 over the first indicating element 170 indicates sufficient force has been applied
    to the hub 160 and/or fluid storage container 140 to create fluid-tight engagement.
    [0056]          As more clearly shown in Figures 4-7, the second indicating element 180 is
 10 shaped to fit over the first indicating element 170 of the hub 160. The hollow body 182 of the
    second indicating element 180 may be elongate and solid. In one or more embodiments, the
    inside surface 184 of the hollow body 182 adjacent to the distal end 189 and/or the proximal
    end 181 of the second indicating element 180 includes a solid, continuous or uninterrupted
    perimeter 190 that defines the open distal end 189 and/or at the open proximal end 181. In a
 15 specific embodiment, the inside surface 184 and/or the outside surface of body 182 may be free
    of internal threads. In one or more embodiments, the inside surface 184 is shaped to form a
    hollow interior 186 that can envelope the first indicating element 170 as the second indicating
    element 180 advances distally over the first indicating element 170. It will be understood that
    the body 182 extending between the open proximal end 181 and the open distal end 189 of the
20  second indicating element 180 need not be solid and may include openings that allow access to
    the hollow interior 186 from the open distal end 189, open proximal end 181 or along the body
    182, however, the solid perimeter 190 formed by the inside surface 184 adjacent to the open
    distal end 189 and/or the proximal end 181 is continuous.
    [0057]          The second indicating element 180 is disposed within the cavity 166 of the hub
25  as a separate piece and is not attached or connected to the hub before engagement of the hub to
    a fluid storage container. In one specific embodiment, the second indicating element 180 may
    be shaped such that it fits inside the cavity 166 of the hub 160. In a more specific embodiment,
    the second indicating element 180 may be shaped so it is slidable and/or moveable within the
    cavity 166 of the hub 160. In a more specific embodiment, the second indicating element 180
30  may be shaped so that it is not rotatable in any direction within the cavity 166 of the hub 160.
    In an even more specific embodiment, the second indicating element 180 is shaped to allow

                                                       12
    rotation only around the axis extending from the open distal end 189 and the open proximal
    end 181.
    [0058]           In one or more embodiments, the outside surface of body 182 has a cross
    sectional width that permits the second indicating element 180 to fit within the cavity 166 of
  5 the hub 160 and the inside surface 184 at the perimeter has a cross-sectional width that permits
    the second indicating element 180 to slide distally over the first indicating element 170. In a
    more specific embodiment, the body 182 has a thickness that allows the second indicating
    element 180 to advance distally within the recess 163 of the hub 160. The body 182 shown
    more clearly in Figures 4-7 forms a cylinder having a solid circular cross-section along its
 10 entire length and includes a continuous solid perimeter 190 at the distal end 189 and the
    proximal end 181.
    [0059]           It will be understood that the first and second indicating elements may have
    cross-sections of any shape. In one or more embodiments, the first and/or second indicating
    element may have a cross-section such that the inside surface of the first and/or second
 15 indicating element forms a non-circular shape and the outside surface of the first and/or second
    indicating element forms a circular shape. In a specific embodiment, the first and/or second
    indicating element may have a cross-section such that the inside surface forms a circular shape
    and the outside surface forms a non-circular shape. In embodiments wherein the first and/or
    second indicating elements have a non-circular cross-section, it will be understood that the
20  medical device assembly may include a means to control orientation of the second indicating
    element with respect to the first indicating element.
    [0060]           In a more specific embodiment, the outside surface of the body 182 includes an
    outwardly radially extending lip 183 or projection disposed at one or more points along the
    length of the outside surface of the body 182. The lip 183 may be disposed near the distal end
25  181 and/or proximal end 189 of the second indicating element 180. Alternative embodiments
    may include a second indicating element 180 may include a plurality of lips disposed along the
    outside surface of the body 182. The lip 183 may be a single protruding point extending
    outwardly radially from the outside surface of the body 182 or may be peripherally formed
    around the outside surface of the body 182, as shown in Figures 4-7.
30  [0061]           In one or more embodiments, the lip 183 increases the thickness of the body
    182. In a specific embodiment, the cross-sectional width of the second indicating element 180
    at lip is greater than the cross-sectional width of the second indicating element 180 at the

                                                     13
    exterior surface of the second indicating element 180 at remaining portions of the body 182.
    As more clearly shown in the embodiment of Figure 10, the increased cross-sectional width
    formed by the lip 183 forms a interference or friction fit interaction with the sidewall 164 of
    the hub 160 so that the second indicating element 180 is retained within the cavity 166 of the
  5 hub 160 before engagement of the medical device assembly and a fluid storage container,
    when forming a fluid delivery system 100.
    [0062]           In one or more embodiments, the inside surface 184 has a cross-sectional width,
    which is measured at the inside surface 184, that forms an interference fit with the outside
    surface of the first indicating element 170. As will be described in greater detail, the inside
 10 surface 184 of one or more embodiments of the second indicating element 180 defines a
    gradually tapered cross-sectional width that forms a narrowed portion at one or more points
    along the length of the inside surface 184. More specifically, the inside surface 184 may be
    shaped to include a first cross-sectional region defining the narrowest cross-sectional width. In
    a more specific embodiment, the inside surface 184 may be shaped to include a second cross
 15 sectional region that defines a cross-sectional width measured at the inside surface 184 that is
    greater than the cross-sectional width at the first cross-sectional region that extends distally
    and/or proximally from the first cross-sectional region. In one or more embodiments, the
    second cross-sectional region may include a cross-sectional width that increases as it extends
    distally and/or proximally from the first cross-sectional region. In alternative embodiments,
20  the inside surface 184 may be shaped to include a third cross-sectional region that has a cross
    sectional width measured at the inside surface 184 that is greater than the cross-sectional width
    of the first and second cross-sectional regions. The third cross-sectional region may be
    disposed adjacent to the proximal end 181 and/or the distal end 189 of the second indicating
    element 180. In one or more embodiments, the third cross-sectional region may have a cross
25  sectional width that increases or decreases along its length. The third cross-sectional region
    may be disposed adjacent to the second cross-sectional region and the proximal end 181 and/or
    distal end 189 of the second indicating element 180.
    [0063]            In the embodiment shown in Figures 4-7, the second indicating element 180
    includes a circular cross-section and has an inside surface 184 defining a first diameter region
30  185 that may have a narrowed cross-sectional width or diameter measured along the
    circumference of the inside surface at one or more points along the axial length of the body
    182. In one or more embodiments, the first diameter region 185 is a tapered portion that has a

                                                     14
    cross-sectional width that gradually decreases, with respect to the cross-sectional width defined
    by the remaining portions of the inside surface 184 of the second indicating element 180. The
    second indicating element 180 may also include a second diameter region 187 at one or more
    points along the axial length of the inside surface 184 that extends from the first diameter
  5 region 185 toward the distal end 189 and/or the proximal end 181 of the second indicating
    element 180. In one or more embodiments, the inside surface 184 includes a first diameter
    region 185 adjacent the open distal end 189 of the second indicating element 180 and a second
    diameter region 187 having an axial length extending from the first diameter region 185 to the
    open proximal end 181 such that the diameter of the inside surface 184 increases along the
 10 second diameter region 187 from the first diameter region 185 toward the proximal end 181.
    In such embodiments, the second diameter region 180 forms a ramp or ramped portion having
    a proximally increasing diameter measured at the inside surface 184. In a specific
    embodiment, the first diameter region 185 is disposed adjacent to the proximal end 181 of the
    second indicating element 180 and the second diameter region 187 extends distally toward the
 15 distal end 189 of the second indicating element 180.
    [00641          The inside surface 184 of the second indicating element 180 may also include a
    third diameter region 188 that has a diameter greater than the diameter at the first diameter
    region 185 and the diameter at the second diameter region 187. In one or more embodiments,
    the third diameter region 188 has a diameter that is constant along its entire length. In a
20  specific embodiment, the third diameter region 188 has a diameter that increases along its
    length in the proximal or distal direction.
    [0065]          In embodiments which utilize a first diameter region 185, a second diameter
    region 187 and a third diameter region 188, the second diameter region 187 has a diameter that
    is greater than the diameter of the first diameter region 185 and a diameter that is smaller than
25  the diameter of the third diameter region 188. In one or more embodiments, the second
    indicating element 180 includes a first diameter region 185 disposed adjacent to the distal end
    189, second diameter region 187 disposed proximally adjacent to the first diameter region 185
    and a third diameter region 188 disposed proximally adjacent to the second diameter region
    187 and extending toward the proximal end 181. In a more specific embodiment, the diameter
30  of the second diameter region 187 increases as it extends from the first diameter region 185 to
    the third diameter region 188. In an even more specific embodiment, the third diameter region
    188 has a diameter that increases along its length in the distal or proximal direction.

                                                      15
    [0066]           In one or more embodiments, the third diameter region 188 has a diameter
    measured at the inside surface 184 that is sized to prevent the tip 150 of the fluid storage
    container 140 from entering or being inserted into the hollow interior 186 of the second
    indicating element. In embodiments of the second indicating element 180 that are composed
  5 of a plastic or polymeric material, the third diameter region 188 is sufficiently rigid to provide
    support to the second indicating element 180 to prevent deformation during use or, more
    specifically, upon application of a force on the hub and/or fluid storage container that causes
    the second indicating element 180 to advance distally over the first indicating element 170
    and/or the protrusion 175. The third diameter region 188 of a specific embodiment may also
 10 have a diameter equal to or larger than the diameter of the first indicating element 170 and/or
    the diameter formed by the protrusion 175 and the first indicating element 170. In one or more
    embodiments, the diameter of the third diameter region 188 is greater than the diameter formed
    by the protrusion 175 such that the third diameter region 188 is permitted to advance distally
    past the protrusion 175. In such embodiments, advancement of the third diameter region 188
 15 distally past the protrusion 175 indicates fluid tight engagement of the medical device and the
    fluid storage container and that no residual or additional force should be applied to the hub 160
    in the proximal direction toward the fluid storage container or to the fluid storage container
    140 in the distal direction toward the hub 160.
    [00671           The first diameter region 185 forms an entrance angle 178 at the distal end 189
20  of the second indicating element 180 that permits the second indicating element 180 to move
    distally over the first indicating element 170, while forming line contact with the first
    indicating element 170 and the protrusion 175. It will be understood that prior to activation,
    line contact may be formed between the entrance angle 178 and the first indicating element
    170. In a specific embodiment, the entrance angle 178 also forms line contact with the
25  protrusion 175. In a more specific embodiment, line contact may be formed between the
    entrance angle 178 and the first diameter region 185 and the first indicating element 170 and
    the protrusion 175.
    [0068]           As shown in the movements of the first and second indicating elements 170,
    180 in Figures10-17 , the second indicating element 180 forms one or more line contact
30  interactions with the first indicating element 180 and/or protrusion 175 as the second indicating
    element 180 enters the recess 163 and slides distally over the first indicating element 170. As
    shown in Figures 12-13, one or more line contact interactions are formed from the point at

                                                       16
    which the first indicating element 170 contacts the entrance angle 178 of the second indicating
    element 180. In one or more embodiments, the firsts indicating element 170 bends radially
    inwardly and permits the second indicating element 180 to further advance distally into the
    recess 163 while line contact is maintained between the first indicating element 170 and the
  5 second indicating element 180. As a proximally directed force is applied to the hub 160
    toward the fluid storage container 140 or a distally directed force is applied to the fluid storage
    container 140 toward the hub 160, the second indicating element 180 continues to advance
    distally past the first indicating element 170 and forms one or more line contact interactions
    when the first indicating element 170 and/or protrusion 175 contacts the first diameter region
 10 185 of the second indicating element 180, as shown in Figures 14-15. As the user continues to
    apply a proximally directed force to the hub 160 toward the fluid storage container 140 or a
    distally directed force is applied to the fluid storage container 140 toward the hub 160, one or
    more line contact interactions are formed as the first indicating element 170 and/or protrusion
    175 contacts the second diameter region 187 and/or the third diameter region 188 of the second
 15 indicating element 180, as shown in Figures 16-17. In one or more embodiments, as the
    second diameter region 187 advances distally past the protrusion 175 and the third diameter
    region 188 begins to advance distally past the protrusion 175, line contact is no longer
    maintained. According to one or more embodiments, once the second indicating element 180
    has moved distally past the protrusion 175 of the first indicating element, the protrusion 175
20  retains the second indicating element 180 within the recess 163 by preventing 180 and,
    specifically the first diameter portion 185, from moving in the proximal direction.
    [0069]           In a specific embodiment, the entrance angle 178 formed between first diameter
    region 185 at the distal end 189 of the second indicating element 180 has a radius that is larger
    than the height of the protrusion 185. In such embodiments, the larger radius of the second
25  indicating element ensures the second indicating element 180 advances smoothly distally past
    the protrusion 175
    [0070]           According to one or more embodiments, the solid perimeter 190 formed by
    inside surface 184 of the second indicating element at the distal end 189 and the proximal end
    181 maintains its shape or resists deformation as the second indicating element 180 moves
30  distally over the first indicating element 170 and protrusion 175. The solid perimeter 190 of the
    second indicating element 180 forms a contact area between the inside surface 184 and the
    outside surface of the first indicating element 170 and/or the protrusion 175. For example, in

                                                        17
    embodiments which utilize a cylindrical second indicating element 180, the solid perimeter
    190 maintains a circular shape as the second indicating element 180 moves distally over the
    first indicating element 170 and protrusion 175 and forms a circular contact area between the
    inside surface 184 and the outside surface of the first indicating element 170. In one or more
  5 embodiment, the rigidity of the solid perimeter 190 ensures that the second indicating element
    180 maintains its shape and thus allows use of the medical device assembly with fluid-storage
    containers that require higher or increased engagement force to form a fluid-tight engagement
    between the medical device assembly and the fluid storage container 140. Interruptions in the
    solid perimeter 190 formed by the inside surface 184 at the distal end 189 and/or proximal end
 10 181 of the second indicating element 180 cause the second indicating element 180 to deform as
    it moves distally over the first indicating element 170 and protrusion 175, causing variability in
    engagement forces required to connect the hub 160 and fluid storage container 140 in fluid
    tight engagement. For example, the presence of interruptions in the solid perimeter 190 formed
    by the inside surface 184 of a second indicating element 180 having a cylindrical shape may
 15 cause the body 182 to deform such that the cross-section of the body 182 changes from a
    circular shape to an ellipsoidal shape. In another example, where the second indicating
    element 180 has a regular polygonal shape, interruptions in the solid perimeter 190 formed by
    the inside surface 184 may deform the body such that the cross-section of the body 182
    changes from a regular polygonal to an irregular polygonal.
20  [0071j           Interaction between non-conformal surfaces creates either a line or surface
    contact. The tapered geometry of the embodiments of the second indicating element 180
    allows the formation of line contact interactions between the second indicating element 180
    and the first indicating element 170. Line contact interactions distribute the stress and pressure
    applied to both surfaces among more than one point or location. This reduces the stress
25  applied to any single point thereby reducing likelihood that a defect in one or both of the
    surfaces will result in a failure of the structural integrity of either part. Medical device
    assemblies which do not have a tapered second indicating element are likely to form only point
    or surface contacts with the first indicating element. In these assemblies the stress or force
    applied to both surfaces is not distributed According to one or more embodiments of the
30  present invention, the inside surface 184 of the second indicating element 180 is further
    contoured to maintain line-contact with the first indicating element 170 as the second
    indicating element 180 moves distally over the first indicating element 170 and the protrusion

                                                     18
    175. In one or more embodiments, once the second diameter region 187 advances distally past
    the protrusion 175, there is no contact between the protrusion 175 and second indicating
    element 180. Specifically, the entrance angle 178, first diameter region 185, second diameter
    region 187 and the third diameter region 188 are shaped to create line contact between the
  5 second indicating element 180 and the first indicating element 170 and the protrusion 175
    throughout the range of distal movement of the first diameter region 185 and second diameter
    region 187 distally past the protrusion 175 of the first indicating element
    [0072]          An alternative embodiment of the second indicating element 380 is shown in
    Figure 8. The second indicating element 380 has a body 382 extending from an open distal
 10 end 389 to an open proximal end 381. The body 382 includes an inside surface 384 defining a
    hollow interior 386 and a lip 383 outwardly radially extending from the outside surface of the
    body 382. The inside surface 384 includes a tapered portion 385 adjacent the open distal end
    389, a ramped portion 387 proximally adjacent to the tapered diameter portion 385, an
    enlarged portion 388 adjacent the open proximal end 381. The ramped portion 387 has an
 15 axial length extending from the tapered portion 385 toward the enlarged portion 388 such that
    the cross-sectional width measured at the inside surface 384 increases along the ramped
    portion 387 from the tapered portion 385 toward the enlarged portion 388. In this
    embodiment, the length of the ramped portion 387 is reduced in length such that the change in
    cross-sectional width measured at the inside surface 384 at the tapered portion 385 and the
20  enlarged portion 388 is more abrupt or less gradual. In such embodiments, fluid-tight
    engagement of the hub and the fluid storage device provides more noticeable tactile feedback,
    while maintaining one or more line contact interactions between the first indicating element
    and the second indicating element 380. For example, upon advancement of the tapered portion
    385 distally past the first indicating element and the protrusion creates a snappier or crisper
25  engagement. This enhanced tactile feedback is believed to be produced from the expansion of
    the cross-sectional width measured from the inside surface 384 upon advancement of the
    tapered portion 385 distally past the protrusion with more rapid alignment of the protrusion
    with the enlarged portion 388.
    [0073]          The second indicating element of one or more embodiments described herein
30  may be formed from a plastic material or from metal. In one or more embodiments, the second
    indicating element is injection molded using an injection moldable plastic such as
    polypropylene, polyethylene, polycarbonate or combinations thereof. As discussed above, the

                                                      19
    inside surface of the second indicating element forms one or more line contact interactions as
    the second indicating element advances distally over the first indicating element. It is believed
    that line contact interactions reduce sensitivity to molding defects on the protrusion and/or the
    first indicating element. The line contact interactions are also believed to reduce deformation
  5 of the inside surface of embodiments of second indicating element as it passes distally over the
    protrusion.
    [0074]           Previous attempts at providing a means for indicating fluid-tight engagement
    often utilize elements with abrupt changes in diameter, structural angles and contact
    interactions, to provide sufficient tactile feedback to the user. Such attempts discouraged the
 10 use of more gradual changes in diameter or other structural features. These attempts also
    utilize rigid materials to enhance tactile feedback and incorporate structural gaps in the body of
    the elements to accommodate for potential skiving and unpredictable engagement forces that
    may result from the rigidity and/or stiffness of the materials utilized. Further, the need to
    produce tactile feedback also limits the range of materials that can be used to produce the
 15 desired structures
    [0075]           Previous attempts at improving connection mechanisms for securely connecting
    a hub to fluid storage containers in fluid-tight engagement and mechanisms to indicate such
    engagement between a hub and fluid container have focused on modifying the type of
    materials utilized for the first and/or second indicating elements. Modifying materials was also
20  thought to result in additional benefits such as reducing the weight of the medical device
    assembly and allowing the use of other methods of production, such as molding, that can
    increase production capacity more easily than other methods of production, such as stamping
    used to form metallic components. The variation in production methods also permits a greater
    selection of materials. Specific attempts at modifying the materials used to form the first and/or
25  second indicating elements focused on using a more rigid plastic material to manufacture the
    first and/or second indicating elements. Such materials were believed to provide a better
    indicator of the engagement force needed to form fluid-tight engagement between the hub and
    the fluid storage container. In such attempts, however, the more rigid plastic did not have a
    direct consequence on the engagement forces needed for the fluid-tight engagement of the hub
30  to the fluid storage container. Further use of varying materials caused additional problems
    such as variability in engagement forces of the first indicating element and second indicating

                                                     20
    element, which prevented accurate indication of fluid-tight engagement between the hub and
    the fluid storage container.
    [0076]          Modifying the shape of the components, for example, by utilizing the tapered
    design for the second indicating element described herein, mitigated these problems. The solid
  5 perimeter 190 design of the second indicating element further improved manufacturability and
    allowed the selection and use of more elastic materials, which reduces the dependency on exact
    dimensions. Further, the surface finishes of the outside surface of the first indicating element
    and the inside surface of the second indicating element can be modified to ensure more
    consistent interaction between the first and second indicating elements.
 10 [0077]          In one or more embodiments, second indicating elements 180 manufactured by
    injection molding are substantially free of structural projections caused by other manufacturing
    methods that have limited application based on the material used. Such structural projections
    include projections that extend radially outwardly from the body at the distal end and/or
    proximal end, that may cause skiving of the hub or other increases in the engagement force
 15 required to form a fluid-tight engagement between the hub and tip.
    [0078]          In one or more embodiments, the sidewall 164 of the hub, the first indicating
    element 170 and/or the second indicating element 180 may also be shaped and configured to
    reduce dead space or unoccupied space between the tip 150 and the passageway 130. In
    previous attempts at a connection mechanism to indicate fluid-tight engagement between the
20  hub and the fluid-storage container, gaps were included in the perimeter at the openings of the
    second indicating element as a result of limited production means and materials. In such
    embodiments the open gaps resulted in increased dead space within the hub when attached to a
    fluid storage device. Embodiments of the second indicating element 180 which include a solid
    and continuous body 182 reduce dead space within the cavity when the hub is attached to the
25  fluid-storage device. In one or more embodiments, the length of the first indicating element
    170 may be adjusted to permit the distal end of one or more embodiments of the second
    indicating element described herein to advance into the recess 163 formed between the first
    indicating element 170 and the sidewall 164 until it contacts the distal end 169 of the hub 160.
    In such embodiments, the length of the first indicating element 170 and the movement of the
30  distal end of the second indicating element provide additional indication of fluid tight
    engagement between the hub 160 and the tip or fluid storage container by preventing the user
    from applying a force on the hub in the proximal direction or the fluid storage container in the

                                                      21
    distal direction. In an alternative embodiment, the length of the first indicating element 170
    may be adjusted to allow the use of second indicating elements having different lengths. In
    one or more embodiments, the length of the first indicating element 170 is sufficiently long to
    permit the second indicating element to advance distally past the protrusion 175 without
  5 interference or being blocked by the distal end 169 of the hub 160. Alternatively, the length of
    the body 182 of the second indicating element 180 may be reduced to reduce dead space
    between the tip 150 and the passageway 130 The sidewall 164 may also be adjusted or
    modified to reduce or increase the length and/or dimensions of the recess 163, however, the
    length of the recess 163 should permit the second indicating element 180 to advance distally
 10 past the protrusion 175.
    [00791           An alternative embodiment of the hub 360 is shown in Figures 18A and 18B.
    The hub 360 includes a sidewall 364 and a first indicating element 370 that is flexible and
    which forms a recess 363 with the sidewall 364. As the user applies the pre-determined force
    on the hub 360 to form a fluid-tight engagement between the hub 360 and a fluid storage
 15 container, the first indicating element 380 flexes inwardly toward the passageway 330 to
    permit the body 382 of the second indicating element to advance distally over the first
    indicating element 370 and/or protrusion 375 into the recess 363. The ability of the first
    indicating element 370 to resume its original shape creates a tactile feedback for the user of
    fluid-tight engagement between the hub 360 and the fluid storage container. As shown in
20  Figures 18B and A, the ramped portion 387 of the second indicating element 280 has a reduced
    length that results in a more dramatic increase in diameter or cross-sectional width measured at
    various points along the inside surface of the second indicating element. In such embodiments,
    the first indicating element is permitted to flex and relax more rapidly thereby producing
    enhanced tactile feedback for the user of fluid-tight engagement between the hub and the fluid
25  storage container.
    [0080]           According to an alternative embodiment, the body of the second indicating
    element may be flexible and may flex as the second indicating element advances distally over
    the first indicating element and/or protrusion. In such embodiments, the solid perimeter may
    be rigid and retains its shape as the second indicating element advances distally over the first
30  indicating element. In a more specific embodiment, one of the first indicating element and the
    second indicating element has greater flexibility that the other of the first indicating element
    and the second indicating element. In an even more specific embodiment, one of the first

                                                       22
    indicating element and second indicating element is flexible while the other of the two is
    relatively inflexible in comparison to the flexible element.
    [0081]           In embodiments where there is gradual increase in diameter or cross-sectional
    width measured at various points along the length of the inside surface of the second indicating
  5 element, the first indicating element and/or the second indicating element can provide tactile
    feedback through the use of different materials with different flexibility or rigidity that permit
    the flexed element to resume its original shape after the second indicating element advances
    distally past the protrusion of the first indicating element.
    [0082]           A second aspect of the present invention pertains to an indication system for use
 10 with the medical device assemblies described herein during attachment to a fluid storage
    container, for example, the fluid storage container 140 shown in Figure 1. The indication
    system provides visual indication of optimal engagement or optimal degree of press-fit or
    interference fit has been achieved during connection of the hub, for example, the hub 160
    shown in Figure 1, and the fluid storage container. Specifically, the indication system provides
 15 visual indication of over-tightening, under-tightening and optimal tightening of the luer slip
    connection between hub 160 and the fluid storage container 140. Over-tightening of the hub
    160 and fluid storage container luer slip may cause excessive compressive force at the joint or
    mating interface between the hub 160 and fluid storage container 140. This excessive
    compressive force can later require the user to apply a large amount of force to disassemble the
20  hub 160 from the fluid storage container 140. Under-tightening of the hub 160 and fluid
    storage container luer slip connection may compromise the effectiveness of the fluid-tight
    engagement or seal formed by the connection and may result in leakage of the medication
    being delivered from within fluid storage container through the hub 160 or even complete
    separation of the hub 160 from the fluid storage container 140.
25  [0083]           The indication system of the embodiment shown in Figures 19-22 includes a
    visual indicator 400 that is added to the fluid storage container 440, for example, along the
    circumference of the tip or opening of the fluid storage container 440. In one or more
    embodiments, the visual indicator is a colored region that is printed or over-molded onto the
    fluid storage container. Other means known in the art may be utilized to apply or form the
30  visual indicator on the fluid storage container 440. During attachment of the hub 460 to the
    fluid storage container 440, a force is applied to the hub 460 in the proximal direction relative
    to the fluid storage container 440. After application of the force, the position of the hub 460

                                                       23
    relative to the visual indicator 400 indicates whether adequate force has been applied to the
    hub to obtain optimal tightening. As shown more clearly in Figure 20, optimal engagement is
    indicated by alignment of the visual indicator 400 directly adjacent to the hub 460. Figure 21
    illustrates overlap of the visual indicator 400 and hub 460 indicating an over-tightened
  5 connection between the hub 460 and the fluid storage container 440. Figure 22 illustrates a
    space between the visual indicator 400 and the hub 460, indicating an under-tightened
    connection between the hub 460 and the fluid storage container 440.
    [0084]           In a specific embodiment, the visual indicator 400 includes three separate
    stripes (not shown) formed at three different locations from near the opening of the fluid
 10 storage container and proximally along the length of the fluid-storage. In a more specific
    embodiment, the three stripes may have different colors. In such embodiments, the first stripe
    disposed closest to the opening of the fluid storage container is the first stripe and may be red
    in color, the second stripe disposed proximally adjacent to the first stripe may be green in color
    and the third stripe disposed proximally adjacent to the second stripe may be yellow in color.
 15 As a force is applied to the hub in the proximal direction toward the fluid storage container or a
    force is applied to the fluid storage container in the distal direction toward the hub, visibility of
    the first, second and third stripes (or the red, green and yellow stripes) indicates under
    tightening and that additional force must be applied to the hub and/or fluid storage container.
    Visibility of the second and third stripes (or the green and yellow stripes) indicates optimal
20  tightening while visibility of only the third stripe (or the yellow stripe) indicates over
    tightening. In one or more embodiments, the indication system of Figures 19-22 may be useful
    in providing visual indication of fluid-tight engagement between the medical assemblies
    described herein that provide reduced tactile feedback of fluid-tight engagement. Examples of
    such embodiments assemblies with a second indicating element 180 that does not include a
25  third diameter region 188 or that includes a second diameter region 187 having a length
    sufficiently long enough that the change in diameter from the first diameter region and the
    remaining length of the second indicating element is gradual or less abrupt. Alternatively, the
    indication system of Figures 19-22 may also be utilized with embodiments with enhanced
    tactile feedback to provide an additional indication of fluid-tight engagement between the
30  medical device assembly and the fluid storage container.
    [0085]           A third aspect of the present invention pertains to methods of using the medical
    devices described herein. In one or more embodiments, the method includes providing a hub

                                                      24
    including a sidewall having an inside surface defining a cavity, an open proximal end, a distal
    end having an opening therethrough in fluid communication with the cavity and a second
    indicating element disposed within the cavity. The method further includes positioning the hub
    such that the open proximal end is aligned with the opening of a fluid storage container and
  5 applying a proximally directed force on the hub or applying a distally directed force on the
    fluid storage container such that the opening of the fluid storage container is disposed within
    the cavity and abuts the second indicating element. The method further includes applying a
    continuous force in the proximal direction on the hub and/or in the distal direction on the fluid
    storage container to force the second indicating element to advance distally further into the
 10 cavity and engage with the hub. In embodiments of the medical device which utilize a first
    indicating element extending from the distal end of the hub into the cavity, the method includes
    applying a continuous force on the hub in the proximal direction toward the fluid storage
    container and/or on the fluid storage container in the distal direction toward the hub such that
    the second indicating element envelopes the first indicating element and enters into the recess
 15 formed between the first indicating element and the hub, until the hub and fluid storage device
    are in fluid-tight engagement.
