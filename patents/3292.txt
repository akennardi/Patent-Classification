         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         The present invention relates to a method for pharmaceutical preparation which
 5 belongs to the field of organic synthesis, more particularly, relates to tranquilizer drug
   chlormezanone synthesis method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         Chlormethazone is an anxiolytic d with weak stability and muscle relaxation.
10 The site of action is mainly in the thalamus, brain basal nucleus, brain margin system,
   mesencephalic network structure. It has no effect plant nerve, nor anti-adrenaline
   effect and anticholinergic effect, no significant impact on the circulatory system. The
   inhibition of product on the spinal cord of the single-contact reflex is very small, the
   inhibition effect of complex synapses is very strong, which showed a central muscle
15 relaxation effect. It can improve the emotional state of moderate anxiety without
   awareness disorder. 30 minutes after oral administration of this product can be
   maintained for 8-10 hours, it is rapid oxidated in the body, water-soluble products
   obtained by hydrolysis, p-chlorobenzoic acid and p-chlorobenzoylamino acetic acid in
   the form of glycine discharge from the urine. Chlormethazone discharges with the
                                                                              4
20 trace of the original drug from the urine in the 24 hours, labeled by     1 C nuclide oral
   test, the metabolites in 24 hours and 48 hours by the urine discharge are the amount of
   70% and 74%         dose. Therefore, the synthesis of chlormethazone is of great
   significance. However, most of the existing synthetic methods are using the method
   that derived by p-chlorobenzaldehyde          condensed   with methylamine        solution,
25 mercaptopropionic acid cyclization, potassium permanganate solution oxidation, it is
   complicated and the final yield is not very high. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a
   new synthetic method for further improving the quality and yield of the product and
   reducing the byproduct content, it has important economic significance.
