                                          BACKGROUND
[0003]     Synucleinopathies also known as Lewy body diseases (LBDs), are characterized by
degeneration of the dopaminergic system, motor alterations, cognitive impairment, and
formation of Lewy bodies (LBs) and/or Lewy neurites. (McKeith et al., Neurology (1996)
47:1113-24).     Synucleinopathies include Parkinson's disease (including idiopathic Parkinson's
disease), Diffuse Lewy Body Disease (DLBD) also known as Dementia with Lewy Bodies
(DLB), Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease (LBV), Combined Alzheimer's and Parkinson
disease, pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy (MSA; e.g., Olivopontocerebellar
Atrophy, Striatonigral Degeneration and Shy-Drager Syndrome). Several nonmotor signs and
symptoms are thought to be harbingers for synucleinopathies in the prodromal phase of the
diseases (i.e, the presymptomatic, subclinical, preclinical, or premotor period). Such early signs
include, for example, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), loss of smell and constipation
(Mahowald et al., Neurology (2010) 75:488-489). Lewy body diseases continue to be a common
cause for movement disorders and cognitive deterioration in the aging population (Galasko et al.,
Arch. Neurol. (1994) 51:888-95).
[0004] Alpha-synuclein is part of a large family of proteins including beta- and gamma
synuclein and synoretin. Alpha-synuclein is expressed in the normal state associated with
synapses and is believed to play a role in neural plasticity, learning

and memory. Several studies have implicated alpha-synuclein with a central role in
PD pathogenesis. The protein can aggregate to form insoluble fibrils in pathological
conditions. For example, synuclein accumulates in LBs (Spillantini et al., Nature
(1997) 388:839-40; Takeda et al., J. Pathol. (1998) 152:367-72; Wakabayashi et al.,
Neurosci. Lett. (1997) 239:45-8). Mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene co-segregate
with rare familial forms of parkinsonism (Kruger et al., Nature Gen. (1998) 18:106-8;
Polymeropoulos, et al., Science (1997) 276:2045-7). Over expression of alpha
synuclein in transgenic mice (Masliah et al., Science (2000) 287:1265-9) and
Drosophila (Feany et al., Nature (2000) 404:394-8) mimics several pathological
aspects of Lewy body disease. In addition, it has been suggested that soluble
oligomers of synuclein may be neurotoxic (Conway KA, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci
USA (2000) 97:571-576; VollesMJ, Lansbury PT, Jr Biochemistry (2003) 42:7871
7878). The accumulation of alpha-synuclein with similar morphological and
neurological alterations in species and animal models as diverse as humans, mice, and
flies suggests that this molecule contributes to the development of Lewy body disease.

                                      DEFINITIONS
[0059]    Monoclonal antibodies are typically provided in isolated form. This means
that an antibody is typically at least 50% w/w pure of proteins and other
macromolecules arising from its production or purification but does not exclude the
possibility that the monoclonal antibody is combined with an excess of
pharmaceutical acceptable carrier(s) or other vehicle intended to facilitate its use.
Sometimes monoclonal antibodies are at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95 or 99% w/w
pure of proteins and other macromolecules from production or purification.
[00601    Specific binding of a monoclonal antibody to its target antigen means an
affinity of at least 106, 107 , 10 109, or 1010 M-. Specific binding is detectably higher
in magnitude and distinguishable from non-specific binding occurring to at least one
unrelated target. Specific binding can be the result of formation of bonds between
particular functional groups or particular spatial fit (e.g., lock and key type) whereas
nonspecific binding is usually the result of van der Waals forces. Specific binding
does not however necessarily imply that a monoclonal antibody binds one and only
one target.
[00611    The basic antibody structural unit is a tetramer of subunits. Each tetramer
includes two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one "light" (about
25 kDa) and one "heavy" chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of
each chain includes variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily
responsible for antigen recognition. This variable region is initially expressed linked
to a cleavable signal peptide. The variable region without the signal peptide is
                                              9

sometimes referred to as a mature variable region. Thus, for example, a light chain
mature variable region means a light chain variable region without the light chain
signal peptide. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region
primarily responsible for effector function.
10062]     Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are
classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as
IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable
and constant regions are joined by a "J"region of about 12 or more amino acids, with
the heavy chain also including a "D" region of about 10 or more amino acids. (See
generally, Fundamental Immunology (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y., 1989,
Ch. 7, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes).
[0063]     The mature variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody
binding site. Thus, an intact antibody has two binding sites. Except in bifunctional or
bispecific antibodies, the two binding sites are the same. The chains all exhibit the
same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by
three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or
CDRs. The CDRs from the two chains of each pair are aligned by the framework
regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. From N-terminal to C-terminal, both
light and heavy chains comprise the domains FRI, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3
and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the
definitions of Kabat, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 1987 and 1991), or Chothia & Lesk, J. Mol. Biol.
196:901-917 (1987); Chothia et al., Nature 342:878-883 (1989). Kabat also provides
a widely used numbering convention (Kabat numbering) in which corresponding
residues between different heavy chains or between different light chains are assigned
the same number (e.g., H83 means position 83 by Kabat numbering in the mature
heavy chain variable region; likewise position L36 means position 36 by Kabat
numbering in the mature light chain variable region).
[00641     The term "antibody" includes intact antibodies and binding fragments
thereof Typically, fragments compete with the intact antibody from which they were
derived for specific binding to the target including separate heavy chains, light chains
Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2, F(ab)c, diabodies, Dabs, nanobodies, and Fv. Fragments can be
produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical separation of
intact immunoglobulins. The term "antibody" also includes a bispecific antibody
                                              10

and/or a humanized antibody. A bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an artificial
hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding
sites (see, e.g., Songsivilai and Lachmann, Clin. Exp. Immunol., 79:315-321 (1990);
Kostelny et al., J. Immunol. 148:1547-53 (1992)). In some bispecific antibodies, the
two different heavy/light chain pairs include a humanized 9E4 heavy chain/light chain
pair and a heavy chain/light chain pair specific for a different epitope on alpha
synuclein than that bound by 9E4. Humanized antibodies are discussed generally
below in Section IV B.
 10065]    The term "epitope" refers to a site on an antigen to which an antibody binds.
An epitope can be formed from contiguous amino acids or noncontiguous amino acids
juxtaposed by tertiary folding of one or more proteins. Epitopes formed from
contiguous amino acids are typically retained on exposure to denaturing solvents
whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding are typically lost on treatment with
denaturing solvents. An epitope typically includes at least 3, and more usually, at
least 5 or 8-10 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation. Methods of determining
spatial conformation of epitopes include, for example, x-ray crystallography and 2
dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. See, e.g., Epitope Mapping Protocols, in
Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 66, Glenn E. Morris, Ed. (1996).
 [0066]    Antibodies that recognize the same or overlapping epitopes can be identified
in a simple immunoassay showing the ability of one antibody to compete with the
binding of another antibody to a target antigen. The epitope of an antibody can also
be defined by X-ray crystallography of the antibody bound to its antigen to identify
contact residues. Alternatively, two antibodies have the same epitope if all amino
acid mutations in the antigen that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce
or eliminate binding of the other. Two antibodies have overlapping epitopes if some
amino acid mutations that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or
eliminate binding of the other.
 [0067]    Competition between antibodies is determined by an assay in which an
antibody under test inhibits specific binding of a reference antibody to a common
antigen (see, e.g., Junghans et al., Cancer Res. 50:1495, 1990). A test antibody
competes with a reference antibody if an excess of a test antibody (e.g., at least 2x,
 5x, 1Ox, 20x or 100x) inhibits binding of the reference antibody by at least 50% but
preferably 75%, 90% or 99% as measured in a competitive binding assay. Antibodies
identified by competition assay (competing antibodies) include antibodies binding to
                                             11

the same epitope as the reference antibody and antibodies binding to an adjacent
epitope sufficiently proximal to the epitope bound by the reference antibody for steric
hindrance to occur.
 [00681    A "patient" includes a human or other mammalian subject that receives
either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment.
[00691     For purposes of classifying amino acids substitutions as conservative or
nonconservative, amino acids are grouped as follows: Group I (hydrophobic side
chains): met, ala, val, leu, ile; Group II (neutral hydrophilic side chains): cys, ser,
thr; Group III (acidic side chains): asp, glu; Group IV (basic side chains): asn, gln,
his, lys, arg; Group V (residues influencing chain orientation): gly, pro; and Group
VI (aromatic side chains): trp, tyr, phe. Conservative substitutions involve
substitutions between amino acids in the same class. Non-conservative substitutions
constitute exchanging a member of one of these classes for a member of another.
[00701     Percentage sequence identities are determined with antibody sequences
maximally aligned by the Kabat numbering convention. After alignment, if a subject
antibody region (e.g., the entire mature variable region of a heavy or light chain) is
being compared with the same region of a reference antibody, the percentage
sequence identity between the subject and reference antibody regions is the number of
positions occupied by the same amino acid in both the subject and reference antibody
region divided by the total number of aligned positions of the two regions, with gaps
not counted, multiplied by 100 to convert to percentage.
[00711     Compositions or methods "comprising" one or more recited elements may
include other elements not specifically recited. For example, a composition that
comprises antibody may contain the antibody alone or in combination with other
ingredients.
[00721     Designation of a range of values includes all integers within or defining the
range, and all subranges defined by integers within the range.
[00731     Unless otherwise apparent from the context, the term "about" encompasses
values within the SEM of a stated value.
100741     An individual is at increased risk of a disease if the subject has at least one
known risk-factor (e.g., genetic, biochemical, family history, situational exposure)
placing individuals with that risk factor at a statistically significant greater risk of
developing the disease than individuals without the risk factor.
                                             12

[0075]    The term "symptom" refers to a subjective evidence of a disease, such as
altered gait, as perceived by the patient. A "sign" refers to objective evidence of a
disease as observed by a physician.
[00761    Statistical significance means p<;0.05.
10077]     "Cognitive function" refers to mental processes such as any or all of
attention, memory, producing and understanding language, solving problems, and
making an interest in one's surroundings and self-care.
[0078]     "Enhanced cognitive function" or "improved cognitive function" refers to
improvement relative to a baseline, for example, diagnosis or initiation of treatment.
"Decline of cognitive function" refers to a decrease in function relative to such a base
line.
[0079]    In animal model systems such as rat or mouse, cognitive function may be
measured by methods using a maze in which subjects use spatial information (e.g,
Morris water maze, Barnes circular maze, elevated radial arm maze, T maze and
others), fear conditioning, active avoidance, illuminated open-field, dark activity
meter, elevated plus-maze, two-compartment exploratory test or forced swimming
test.
[00801    In humans, cognitive function can be measured by one or more of several
standardized tests. Examples of a test or assay for cognitive function were described
(Ruoppila, 1.and Suutama, T. Scand. J. Soc. Med. Suppl. 53,44-65, 1997) and include
standardized psychometric tests (e. g. Wechsler Memory Scale, the Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale, Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices, Schaie- Thurstone Adult
Mental Abilities Test), neuropsychological tests (e. g. Luria-Nebraska), metacognitive
self-evaluations (e. g. Metamemory Questionnaire), visual-spatial screening tests (e.
g. Poppelreuter's Figures, Clock Recognition, Honeycomb Drawing and
Cancellation), cognitive screening tests (e. g. Folstein's Mini Mental State Test) and
reaction time tests. Other standard tests for cognitive performance include the
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog); the clinical
global impression of change scale (CIBIC-plus scale); the Alzheimer's Disease
Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL); the Mini Mental
State Exam (MMSE); the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI); the Clinical Dementia
Rating Scale (CDR); the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery
                                            13

(CANTAB) or the Sandoz Clinical Assessment- Geriatric (SCAG), Stroop Test, Trail
Making, Wechsler Digit Span, and the CogState computerized cognitive test. In
addition, cognitive function may be measured using imaging techniques such as
Positron Emission Tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), or any other
imaging technique that allows one to measure brain function.
                             DETAILED DESCRIPTION
I.      General
[00811    The invention provides humanized 9E4 antibodies. The antibodies are
useful for treatment and diagnoses of a Lewy body disease.
II.     Target molecules
[00821    Natural human wildtype alpha-synuclein is a peptide of 140 amino acids
having the following amino acid sequence:
MDVFMKGLSK AKEGVVAAAE KTKQGVAEAA GKTKEGVLYV
GSKTKEGVVH GVATVAEKTK EQVTNVGGAV VTGVTAVAQK
TVEGAGSIAA ATGFVKKDQL GKNEEGAPQE GILEDMPVDP DNEAYEMPSE
EGYQDYEPEA (SEQ ID NO:12)
(Ueda et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1993) 90:11282-6).; GenBank accession
number: P37840). The protein has three recognized domains, a KTKE repeat domain
covering amino acids 1-61, a NAC (Non-amyloid component) domain running from
about amino acids 60-95, and a C-terminal acidic domain running from about amino
acid 98 to 140.
[0083]    Unless otherwise apparent from the context, reference to alpha-synuclein or
its fragments includes the natural human wildtype amino acid sequences indicated
above, and human allelic variants thereof, particularly those associated with Lewy
body disease (e.g., E46K, A30P and A53T, with the first letter indicates the amino
acid in SEQ ID NO:12, the number is the codon position in SEQ ID NO:12, and the
second letter is the amino acid in the allelic variant). Such variants can optionally be
present individually or in any combination in any of the aspect of the invention
described below. The induced mutations E83Q, A90V, A76T, which enhance alpha
synuclein aggregation, can also be present individually or in combination with each
other and/or human allelic variants E46K, A30P and A53T.

II.      Lewy Body Diseases
[00841     Lewy Body Diseases (LBD) are characterized by degeneration of the
dopaminergic system, motor alterations, cognitive impairment, and formation of
Lewy bodies (LBs). (McKeith et al., Neurology (1996) 47:1113-24). Lewy Bodies
are spherical protein deposits found in nerve cells. Their presence in the brain
disrupts the brain's normal function interrupting the action of chemical messengers
including acetylcholine and dopamine. Lewy Body diseases include Parkinson's
disease (including idiopathic Parkinson's disease), Diffuse Lewy Body Disease
(DLBD) also known as Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), Lewy body variant of
Alzheimer's disease (LBV), Combined Alzheimer's and Parkinson disease and as
multiple system atrophy (MSA; e.g., Olivopontocerebellar Atrophy, Striatonigral
Degeneration and Shy-Drager Syndrome). DLBD shares symptoms of both
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. DLBD differs from Parkinson's disease mainly
in the location of Lewy Bodies. In DLBD Lewy Bodies form mainly in the cortex. In
Parkinson's disease, they form mainly in the substantia nigra. Other Lewy Body
diseases include Pure Autonomic Failure, Lewy body dysphagia, Incidental LBD, and
Inherited LBD (e.g., mutations of the alpha-synuclein gene, PARK3 and PARK4).
IV.      Antibodies of the Invention
A.         Binding Specificity and Functional Properties
[00851     Humanized antibodies of the invention specifically bind to human alpha
synuclein.     The affinity of some humanized antibodies (i.e., Ka) is preferably within
a factor of five or two of that of the mouse antibody 9E4. Some humanized
antibodies have an affinity that is the same (within experimental error) or greater than
that of the mouse 9E4 antibody.      Preferred humanized antibodies bind to the same
epitope and/or compete with the mouse antibody 9E4 for binding to human alpha
synuclein.
[0086]     In some antibodies, humanized 9E4 forms one arm of a bispecific antibody,
the other arm of which is an antibody that binds to a receptor expressed on the blood
brain barrier, such as an insulin receptor, an insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor,
a leptin receptor, or a lipoprotein receptor, or preferably a transferrmin receptor (Friden
et al., PNAS 88:4771-4775, 1991; Friden et al., Science 259:373-377, 1993). Such a
bispecific antibody can be transferred cross the blood brain barrier by receptor
                                             15

mediated transcytosis. Brain uptake of the bispecific antibody can be further
enhanced by engineering the bi-specific antibody to reduce its affinity to the blood
brain barrier receptor. Reduced affinity for the receptor resulted in a broader
distribution in the brain (see, e.g., Atwal. et al. Sci. Trans. Med. 3, 84ra43, 2011; Yu
et al. Sci. Trans. Med. 3, 84ra44, 2011).
100871 Exemplary bispecific antibodies can also be (1) a dual-variable-domain
antibody (DVD-Ig), where each light chain and heavy chain contains two variable
domains in tandem through a short peptide linkage (Wu et al., Generation and
Characterization of a Dual Variable Domain Immunoglobulin (DVD-IgTM) Molecule,
In: Antibody Engineering, Springer Berlin Heidelberg (2010)); (2) a Tandab, which is
a fusion of two single chain diabodies resulting in a tetravalent bispecific antibody
that has two binding sites for each of the target antigens; (3) a flexibody, which is a
combination of scFvs with a diabody resulting in a multivalent molecule; (4) a so
called "dock and lock" molecule, based on the "dimerization and docking domain" in
Protein Kinase A, which, when applied to Fabs, can yield a trivalent bispecific
binding protein consisting of two identical Fab fragments linked to a different Fab
fragment; (5) a so-called Scorpion molecule, comprising, e.g., two scFvs fused to both
termini of a human Fc-region. Examples of platforms useful for preparing bispecific
antibodies include but are not limited to BiTE (Micromet), DART (MacroGenics),
Fcab and Mab2 (F-star) , Fc-engineered IgGl (Xencor) or DuoBody (based on Fab
arm exchange, Genmab).
B.         Humanized Antibodies
[00881 A humanized antibody is a genetically engineered antibody in which the
CDRs from a non-human "donor" antibody are grafted into human "acceptor"
antibody sequences (see, e.g., Queen et al., US5,530,101 and 5,585,089; Winter et al.,
US 5,225,539, Carter, US 6,407,213, Adair, US 5,859,205 6,881,557, Foote, US
6,881,557).    The acceptor antibody sequences can be, for example, a mature human
antibody variable region sequence, a composite of such sequences, a consensus
sequence of human antibody sequences (e.g., light and heavy chain variable region
consensus sequences of Kabat, 1991, supra), or a germline variable region sequence.
A preferred acceptor sequence for the heavy chain is the human mature heavy chain
variable region with NCBI accession code AAC50998 (GI: 1791009) or other mature
heavy chain variable region derived from germline IGHV3-7'01 or IGHV3-7'02
(clones name V3-7 or VH3-1 1) (Glas et al., Clin Exp Immunol. 107:372-80, 1997) or
                                             16

a mature heavy chain variable region sequence incorporating one of these germ line
sequences. For the light chain, a preferred acceptor sequence is the light chain mature
variable region with NCBI accession code AAY33350 (GI:63102889) or other mature
light chain sequence derived from the germline IGKV1D-39 or IGKVI-39 (clone
name 02 or 012) (Kramer et al., Eur J Immunol. 35:2131-45, 2005) or a light chain
mature variable region sequence incorporating one of these germ line sequences.
Thus, a humanized antibody of the invention is an antibody having three light chain
and three heavy chain CDRs as defined by Kabat from the donor 9E4 antibody and
mature variable region framework sequences and constant regions, if present, entirely
or substantially from human antibody sequences. Likewise a humanized heavy chain
is a heavy chain having three heavy chain CDRs as defined by Kabat from the heavy
chain of the 9E4 antibody, and a mature heavy chain variable sequence and heavy
chain constant region sequence, if present, entirely or substantially from human
antibody heavy chain sequence. Likewise a humanized light chain is a light chain
having three light chain CDRs as defined by Kabat from the light chain of the 9E4
antibody, and a mature light chain variable sequence and light chain constant region
sequence, if present, entirely or substantially from human antibody light chain
sequence. The mature variable region framework sequences of an antibody chain or
the constant region sequence of an antibody chain are substantially from a human
mature variable region framework sequence or human constant region sequence
respectively when at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% of
corresponding residues defined by Kabat are identical.
[0089]    Certain amino acids from the human mature variable region framework
residues can be selected for substitution based on their possible influence on CDR
conformation and/or binding to antigen. Investigation of such possible influences is
by modeling, examination of the characteristics of the amino acids at particular
locations, or empirical observation of the effects of substitution or mutagenesis of
particular amino acids.
[00901    For example, when an amino acid differs between a murine mature variable
region framework residue and a selected human mature variable region framework
residue, the human framework amino acid can be substituted by the equivalent
framework amino acid from the mouse antibody when it is reasonably expected that
the amino acid:
        (1)     noncovalently binds antigen directly,
                                             17

        (2)     is adjacent to a CDR region,
        (3)     otherwise interacts with a CDR region (e.g. is within about 6 A of a
                CDR region)
        (4)     mediates interaction between the heavy and light chains.
[0091]    The invention provides humanized forms of the mouse 9E4 antibody
including three exemplified humanized light chain mature variable regions
(Hu9E4VLvl-v3; SEQ ID NOs:3-5) and four exemplified humanized heavy chain
mature variable regions (Hu9E4VHv1-v4; SEQ ID NOs:8-1 1). SEQ ID NO:4
includes the three Kabat CDRs of the mouse 9E4 light chain and the mature variable
region frameworks of AAY33350. SEQ ID NOS. 3 and 5 include backmutations as
shown in Table 2. SEQ ID NO. 11 includes the three Kabat CDRs of mouse 9E4 and
the mature variable region frameworks of AAC50998. SEQ ID NOs:8-10 include
backmutations as shown in Table 3.
[00921    The invention provides variants of the humanized 9E4 antibody in which the
humanized heavy chain mature variable region shows at least 90%, 95% or 99%
identity to SEQ ID NOs:8-11 and the humanized light chain mature variable region
shows at least 90, 95 or 99% sequence identity to SEQ ID NOs:3-5, but in which any
variation from the designated SEQ ID NO. occurs in a mature variable region
framework rather than a Kabat CDR. In some such antibodies, position L36 is
occupied by Y or F, and/or position L83 is occupied by F or L, and/or position H73 is
occupied by N or D and/or position H93 is occupied by A or S (all positions here, as
elsewhere, in this application are by Kabat numbering). In some such antibodies,
some or all of the backmutations in Hu9E4VLv1 -v3 and Hu9E4VHv1-v4 are retained.
In other words, one or both of heavy chain positions H73 and H93 is occupied by D
and A respectively. Likewise in some antibodies one or both of light chain positions
L36 and L83 is occupied by F and L respectively. In some antibodies, 1, 2, 3 or all
four of positions H73, H93, L36 and L83 is/are occupied by D, A, F and L
respectively. In some antibodies, 0, 1, or 2 positions are changed in the heavy chain
mature variable region framework relative to SEQ ID NO: 11, and 0, 1, or 2 positions
are change in the light chain mature variable region framework relative to SEQ ID
NO:4.
[00931    Some antibodies comprise a humanized heavy chain comprising the three
Kabat CDRs of SEQ ID NO: 11 and a humanized light chain comprising the three
Kabat CDRs of SEQ ID NO:4 provided that position L36 (Kabat numbering) is
                                            18

13                 Y                 F               D                 A

[0094]    In some antibodies, the heavy chain mature variable region has an amino
acid sequence designated SEQ ID NO: 10. In some antibodies, the light chain mature
variable region has an amino acid sequence designated SEQ ID NO:5 or SEQ ID
NO:3. In some such antibodies, the heavy chain mature variable region has an amino
                                           20

acid sequence designated SEQ ID NO: 10, and the light chain mature variable region
has an amino acid sequence designated SEQ ID NO:5 or SEQ ID NO:3. In some such
antibodies, the heavy chain mature variable region has an amino acid sequence
designated SEQ ID NO:10, and the light chain mature variable region has an amino
acid sequence designated SEQ ID NO:5.
[0095]    Other amino acid substitutions can be made in the mature variable region
framework, for example, in residues not in contact with the CDRs. Often the
replacements made in the variant humanized sequences are conservative with respect
to the replaced amino acids. In some antibodies, replacements relative to
Hu9E4VLv1-v3 and Hu9E4VHv-v4 (whether or not conservative) have no
substantial effect on the binding affinity or potency of the resultant antibody relative
to Hu9E4VLv1-v3 and Hu9E4VHv1-v4, that is, its ability to bind human alpha
synuclein.
[00961    Variants typically differ from the heavy and light chain mature variable
region sequences of Hu9E4VLv1-v3 and Hu9E4VHvl-v4 by a small number (e.g.,
typically no more than 1, 2, 3, 5 or 10 in either the light chain or heavy chain mature
variable region framework, or both) of replacements, deletions or insertions.
C.        Selection of Constant Region
[0097]    The heavy and light chain variable regions of humanized antibodies can be
linked to at least a portion of a human constant region. The choice of constant region
depends, in part, whether antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, antibody
dependent cellular phagocytosis and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity are
desired. For example, human isotopes IgG 1 and IgG3 have complement-dependent
cytotoxicity and human isotypes IgG2 and IgG4 do not. Human IgG1 and IgG3 also
induce stronger cell mediated effector functions than human IgG2 and IgG4. Light
chain constant regions can be lambda or kappa. An exemplary human light chain
kappa constant region has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:13. Some such
light chain kappa constant regions can be encoded by a nucleic acid sequence. The
N-terminal arginine of SEQ ID NO: 13 can be omitted, in which case light chain
kappa constant region has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:28. Some such
light chain kappa constant regions can be encoded by a nucleic acid sequence. An
exemplary human IgG 1 heavy chain constant region has the amino acid sequence of
SEQ ID NO: 14 (with or without the C-terminal lysine). Some such heavy chain
constant regions can be encoded by a nucleic acid sequence. Antibodies can be
                                            21

expressed as tetramers containing two light and two heavy chains, as separate heavy
chains, light chains, as Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv, or as single chain antibodies in
which heavy and light chain mature variable domains are linked through a spacer.
[00981     Human constant regions show allotypic variation and isoallotypic variation
between different individuals, that is, the constant regions can differ in different
individuals at one or more polymorphic positions. Isoallotypes differ from allotypes
in that sera recognizing an isoallotype bind to a non-polymorphic region of a one or
more other isotypes. Thus, for example, another heavy chain constant region is of
IgG1 Glm3 allotype and has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:32. Yet another
heavy chain constant region has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:32 except
that it lacks the C-terminal lysine.
[0099]     One or several amino acids at the amino or carboxy terminus of the light
and/or heavy chain, such as the C-terminal lysine of the heavy chain, may be missing
or derivatized in a proportion or all of the molecules. Substitutions can be made in
the constant regions to reduce or increase effector function such as complement
mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC (see, e.g., Winter et al., US Patent No. 5,624,821; Tso
et al., US Patent No. 5,834,597; and Lazar et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
103:4005, 2006), or to prolong half-life in humans (see, e.g., Hinton et al., J. Biol.
Chem. 279:6213, 2004). Exemplary substitutions include a Gln at position 250 and/or
a Leu at position 428 (EU numbering is used in this paragraph for the constant region)
for increasing the half-life of an antibody. Substitution at any or all of positions 234,
235, 236 and/or 237 reduce affinity for Fcy receptors, particularly FcyRI receptor
(see, e.g., US 6,624,821). Some antibodies have alanine substitution at positions 234,
235 and 237 of human IgGI for reducing effector functions. Optionally, positions
234, 236 and/or 237 in human IgG2 are substituted with alanine and position 235 with
glutamine (see, e.g., US 5,624,821).
D.         Expression of Recombinant Antibodies
[01001     Antibodies can be produced by recombinant expression. Nucleic acids
encoding the antibodies can be codon-optimized for expression in the desired cell
type (e.g., CHO or Sp2/0). Recombinant nucleic acid constructs typically include an
expression control sequence operably linked to the coding sequences of antibody
chains, including naturally-associated or heterologous promoter regions. The
expression control sequences can be eukaryotic promoter systems in vectors capable
                                             22

of transforming or transfecting eukaryotic host cells. Once the vector has been
incorporated into the appropriate host, the host is maintained under conditions suitable
for high level expression of the nucleotide sequences, and the collection and
purification of the crossreacting antibodies. The vector or vectors encoding the
antibody chains can also contain a selectable gene, such as dihydrofolate reductase, to
allow amplification of copy number of the nucleic acids encoding the antibody chains.
[01011     E. coli is a prokaryotic host particularly useful for expressing antibodies,
particularly antibody fragments. Microbes, such as yeast are also useful for
expression. Saccharomyces is a preferred yeast host, with suitable vectors having
expression control sequences, an origin of replication, termination sequences and the
like as desired. Typical promoters include 3-phosphoglycerate kinase and other
glycolytic enzymes. Inducible yeast promoters include, among others, promoters
from alcohol dehydrogenase, isocytochrome C, and enzymes responsible for maltose
and galactose utilizations.
[01021     Mammalian cells can be used for expressing nucleotide segments encoding
immunoglobulins or fragments thereof. See Winnacker, From Genes to Clones,
(VCH Publishers, NY, 1987). A number of suitable host cell lines capable of
secreting intact heterologous proteins have been developed in the art, and include
CHO cell lines, various COS cell lines, HeLa cells, HEK293 cells, L cells, and non
antibody-producing myelomas including Sp2/0 and NSO. It can be advantageous to
use nonhuman cells. Expression vectors for these cells can include expression control
sequences, such as an origin of replication, a promoter, an enhancer (Queen et al.,
Immunol. Rev. 89:49 (1986)), and necessary processing information sites, such as
ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites, and transcriptional
terminator sequences. Suitable expression control sequences are promoters derived
from endogenous genes, cytomegalovirus, SV40, adenovirus, bovine papillomavirus,
and the like. See Co et al., J. Immunol. 148:1149 (1992).
[01031     Having introduced vector(s) encoding antibody heavy and light chains into
cell culture, cell pools can be screened for growth productivity and product quality in
serum-free media. Top-producing cell pools can then be subjected ot FACS-based
single-cell cloning to generate monoclonal lines. Specific productivities above 50 pg
or 100 pg per cell per day, which correspond to product titers of greater than 7.5 g/L
culture, can be advantageous. Antibodies produced by single cell clones can also be
tested for turbidity, filtration properties, PAGE, IEF, UV scan, HP-SEC, carboydrate
                                              23

oligosaccharide mapping, mass spectrometery, and bining assay, such as ELISA or
Biacore. A selected clone can then be banked in multiple vials and stored frozen for
subsequent use.
[01041     Once expressed, antibodies can be purified according to standard procedures
of the art, including protein A capture, column chromatography (e.g., hydrophobic
interaction or ion exchange), low-pH for viral inactivation and the like (see generally,
Scopes, ProteinPurification(Springer-Verlag, NY, 1982)).
[01051     Methodology for commercial production of antibodies including codon
optimization, selection of promoters, transcription elements, and terminators, serum
free single cell cloning, cell banking, use of selection markers for amplification of
copy number, CHO terminator, serum free single cell cloning, improvement of
protein titers (see, e.g., US 5,786,464, US 6,114,148, US 6,063,598, US 7,569,339,
W02004/050884, W02008/012142, W02008/012142, W02005/019442,
W02008/107388, and W02009/027471, and US 5,888,809).
V.      Nucleic Acids
[01061    The invention further provides nucleic acids encoding any of the heavy and
light chains described above. Typically, the nucleic acids also encode a signal peptide
fused to the mature heavy and light chains (e.g., signal peptides having amino acid
sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 22 and 24 that can be encoded by SEQ ID NOS: 23 and
25). Coding sequences on nucleic acids can be in operable linkage with regulatory
sequences to ensure expression of the coding sequences, such as a promoter,
enhancer, ribosome binding site, transcription termination signal and the like. The
nucleic acids encoding heavy and light chains can occur in isolated form or can be
cloned into one or more vectors. The nucleic acids can be synthesized by for
example, solid state synthesis or PCR of overlapping oligonucleotides. Nucleic acids
encoding heavy and light chains can be joined as one contiguous nucleic acid, e.g.,
within an expression vector, or can be separate, e.g., each cloned into its own
expression vector.
VI.     Therapeutic Applications
101071    The invention provides several methods of treating or effecting prophylaxis
of Lewy Body disease in patients suffering from or at risk of such disease. Patients
                                            24

amenable to treatment include individuals at risk of disease of a LBD but not showing
symptoms, as well as patients presently showing symptoms or the early warning signs
of synucleinopathies, for example, EEG slowing, neuropsychiatric manifestations
(depression, dementia, hallucinations, anxiety, apathy, anhedonia), autonomic
changes (orthostatic hypotension, bladder disturbances, constipation, fecal
incontinence, sialorrhea, dysphagia, sexual dysfunction, changes in cerebral blood
flow), sensory changes (olfactory, pain, color discrimination abnormal sensations),
sleep disorders (REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), restless legs syndrome/periodic
extremity movements, hypersomnia, insomnia) and miscellaneous other signs and
symptoms (fatigue, diplopia, blurred vision, seborrhea, weight loss/gain). Therefore,
the present methods can be administered prophylactically to individuals who have a
known genetic risk of a LBD. Such individuals include those having relatives who
have experienced this disease, and those whose risk is determined by analysis of
genetic or biochemical markers. Genetic markers of risk toward PD include
mutations in the alpha-synuclein or Parkin, UCHLI, and CYP2D6 genes; particularly
mutations at positions 30 and 53 of the alpha-synuclein gene. Individuals presently
suffering from Parkinson's disease can be recognized from its clinical manifestations
including resting tremor, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability.
[0108]    In asymptomatic patients, treatment can begin at any age (e.g., 10, 20, 30).
Usually, however, it is not necessary to begin treatment until a patient reaches 40, 50,
60 or 70. Treatment typically entails multiple dosages over a period of time.
Treatment can be monitored by assaying antibody, or activated T-cell or B-cell
responses to a therapeutic agent (e.g., a truncated form of alpha-synuclein peptide)
over time. If the response falls, a booster dosage is indicated.
[0109]    Antibodies can be used for treating or effecting prophylaxis of Lewy Body
disease in patients by administration under conditions that generate a beneficial
therapeutic response in a patient (e.g., reduction of neuritic and/or axonal alpha
synuclein aggregates, reduction of neuritic dystrophy, improving cognitive function,
and/or reversing, treating or preventing cognitive decline) in the patient. In some
methods, the areas of neuritic dystrophy in the neuropil of neocortex and/or basal
ganglia can be reduced by on average at least 10%, 20%, 30%, or 40% in treated
patients compared with a control population. .
                                             25

[0110]    Cognitive impairment, progressive decline in cognitive function, changes in
brain morphology, and changes in cerebrovascular function are commonly observed
in patients suffering from or at risk of Lewy Body disease. Administration of the
present antibodies can inhibit or delay decline of cognitive function in such patients.
[01111    The invention also provides methods of preserving or increasing synaptic
density and/or dentritic density. An index of changes in synaptic or dentritic density
can be measured by markers of synapse formation (synaptophysin) and/or dendrites
(MAP2). In some methods, the synaptic or dentritic density can be restored to the
level of synaptic or dentritic density in a healthy subject. In some methods, the mean
level of synaptic or dentritic density in treated patients can be elevated by 5%, 10%,
15%, 20%, 25%, 30% or more as compared to a population of untreated control
patients.
VII.    Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Treatment
[01121    In prophylactic applications, an antibody or agent for inducing an antibody
or a pharmaceutical composition the same is administered to a patient susceptible to,
or otherwise at risk of a disease in a regime (dose, frequency and route of
administration) effective to reduce the risk, lessen the severity, or delay the onset of at
least one sign or symptom of the disease. In some prophylactic applications, the
regime is effective to inhibit or delay accumulation of alpha synuclein and truncated
fragments in the brain, and/or inhibit or delay its toxic effects and/or inhibit/or delay
development of behavioral deficits. In therapeutic applications, an antibody or agent
to induce an antibody is administered to a patient suspected of, or already suffering
from a Lewy body disease in a regime (dose, frequency and route of administration)
effective to ameliorate or at least inhibit further deterioration of at least one sign or
symptom of the disease. In some therapeutic applications, the regime is effective to
reduce or at least inhibit further increase of levels of alpha synuclein and truncated
fragments, associated toxicities and/or behavioral deficits.
[01131 A regime is considered therapeutically or prophylactically effective if an
individual treated patient achieves an outcome more favorable than the mean outcome
in a control population of comparable patients not treated by methods of the
invention, or if a more favorable outcome is demonstrated in treated patients versus
                                             26

control patients in a controlled clinical trial (e.g., a phase II, phase II/III or phase III
trial) at the p < 0.05 or 0.0 1 or even 0.001 level .
[0114]      Effective doses vary depending upon many different factors, including
means of administration, target site, physiological state of the patient including type
of Lewy body disease, whether the patient is an ApoE carrier, whether the patient is
human or an animal, other medications administered, and whether treatment is
prophylactic or therapeutic.
[0115]      An exemplary dosage range for antibodies is from about 0.01 to 5 mg/kg,
and more usually 0.1 to 3 mg/kg or 0.15-2 mg/kg or 0.15-1.5 mg/kg, of patient body
weight. Antibody can be administered such doses daily, on alternative days, weekly,
fortnightly, monthly, quarterly, or according to any other schedule determined by
empirical analysis. An exemplary treatment entails administration in multiple
dosages over a prolonged period, for example, of at least six months. Additional
exemplary treatment regimes entail administration once per every two weeks or once
a month or once every 3 to 6 months.
[01161      Antibodies can be administered via a peripheral route (i.e., one in which an
administered or induced antibody crosses the blood brain barrier to reach an intended
site in the brain. Routes of administration include topical, intravenous, oral,
subcutaneous, intraarterial, intracranial, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, intranasal or
intramuscular. Some routes for administration of antibodies are intravenous and
subcutaneous. This type of injection is most typically performed in the arm or leg
muscles. In some methods, agents are injected directly into a particular tissue where
deposits have accumulated, for example intracranial injection.
[01171      Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration are can be sterile
and substantially isotonic and manufactured under GMP conditions. Pharmaceutical
compositions can be provided in unit dosage form (i.e., the dosage for a single
administration). Pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated using one or more
physiologically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients or auxiliaries. The
formulation depends on the route of administration chosen. For injection, antibodies
can be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible
buffers such as Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline or acetate
buffer (to reduce discomfort at the site of injection). The solution can contain
formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents.
                                              27

Alternatively antibodies can be in lyophilized form for constitution with a suitable
vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.
10118]    The present regimes can be administered in combination with another agent
effective in treatment or prophylaxis of the disease being treated. For example, in the
case of Parkinson's disease, immunotherapy against alpha synuclein
WO/2008/103472, Levodopa, dopamine agonists, COMT inhibitors, MAO-B
inhibitors, Amantadine, or anticholinergic agents can be used in combination with the
present regimes.
VIII.   Other Applications
[01191    The antibodies described above can be used for detecting alpha-synuclein in
the context of clinical diagnosis or treatment or in research. The antibodies can also
be sold as research reagents for laboratory research in detecting cells bearing alpha
synuclein and their response to various stimuli. In such uses, monoclonal antibodies
can be labeled with fluorescent molecules, spin-labeled molecules, enzymes or
radioisotypes, and can be provided in the form of kit with all the necessary reagents to
perform the assay for alpha-synuclein. The antibodies can also be used to purify
alpha-synuclein, e.g., by affinity chromatography.
[0120]    The antibodies can be used for detecting LBs in a patient. Such methods are
useful to diagnose or confirm diagnosis of PD, or other disease associated with the
presence of LBs in the brain, or susceptibility thereto. For example, the methods can
be used on a patient presenting with symptoms of dementia. If the patient has LBs,
then the patient is likely suffering from a Lewy body disease, such as Parkinson's
disease. The methods can also be used on asymptomatic patients. Presence of Lewy
bodies or other abnormal deposits of alpha-synuclein indicates susceptibility to future
symptomatic disease. The methods are also useful for monitoring disease progression
and/or response to treatment in patients who have been previously diagnosed with a
Lewy body disease.
[01211    The methods can be performed by administering an antibody and then
detecting the antibody after it has bound. If desired, the clearing response can be
avoided by using an antibody fragment lacking a full-length constant region, such as a
                                             28

Fab. In some methods, the same antibody can serve as both a treatment and
diagnostic reagent.
[01221    For diagnosis (e.g., in vivo imaging), the antibodies can be administered by
intravenous injection into the body of the patient, or directly into the brain by
intracranial injection or by drilling a hole through the skull. The dosage of reagent
should be within the same ranges as for treatment methods. Typically, the antibody is
labeled, although in some methods, the antibody is unlabelled and a secondary
labeling agent is used to bind to the antibody. The choice of label depends on the
means of detection. For example, a fluorescent label is suitable for optical detection.
Use of paramagnetic labels is suitable for tomographic detection without surgical
intervention. Radioactive labels can also be detected using PET or SPECT.
[0123]    Diagnosis is performed by comparing the number, size and/or intensity of
labeled loci to corresponding base line values. The base line values can represent the
mean levels in a population of undiseased individuals. Base line values can also
represent previous levels determined in the same patient. For example, base line
values can be determined in a patient before beginning treatment, and measured
values thereafter compared with the base line values. A decrease in values relative to
base line signals a positive response to treatment.
[0124]    The antibodies can be used to generate anti-idiotype antibodies. (see, e.g.,
Greenspan & Bona, FASEB J. 7(5) :437-444, 1989; and Nissinoff, J. Immunol.
147:2429-2438, 1991). Such anti-idiotype antibodies can be utilized in
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, biodistribution studies as well as in studies of
clinical human-anti-human antibody (HAHA) responses in individuals treated with
the antibodies. For example, anti-idiotypic antibodies bind specifically the variable
region of humanized 9E4 antibodies and therefore can be used to detect humanized
9E4 antibodies in pharmacokinetic studies and help to quantify human-anti-human
antibody (HAHA) responses in treated individuals.

practiced within the scope of the appended claims.
                                       EXAMPLES
EXAMPLE I.              Design of humanized 9E4 antibodies
[0126]    The starting point or donor antibody for humanization is the mouse antibody
9E4 produced by the hybridoma having ATCC Accession No. PTA-8221 and
described in U.S. Patent Application No. 11/710,248 (publication number
US2009/0208487). The variable kappa (VK) of 9E4 belongs to mouse Kabat
subgroup 1 which corresponds to human Kabat subgroup 1. The variable heavy (Vh)
of 9E4 belongs to mouse Kabat subgroup 3d which corresponds to human Kabat
subgroup 3 (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth
Edition. NIH Publication No. 91-3242, 1991). Kabat numbering is used throughout in
this Example.
[0127]    The 17-residue CDR-L1 belongs to canonical class 3, the 7-residue CDR-L2
belongs to class 1, and the 9-residue CDR-L3 belongs to class 1 in Vk (Martin &
Thornton, J Mol Biol. 263:800-15, 1996). The 5-residue CDR-H1 belongs to class 1,
and the 17-residue CDR-H2 belongs to class 2 (Martin & Thornton, J Mol Biol.
263:800-15, 1996). CDR-H3 has no canonical classes, but the 7 residue loop
probably has a kinked base according to the rules of Shirai et al. (FEBS Lett. 455:188
97, 1999).
                                             30

101281    A search was made over the protein sequences in the PDB database
(Deshpande et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 33: D233-7, 2005) to find structures which
would provide a rough structural model of 9E4. The crystal structure of dimeric
antibody X836 (pdb code 3MBX) (Teplyakov et al, Mol Immunol., 47(14):2422-6,
2010) was chosen for the VK structure since it had good resolution (1.6A) and overall
sequence similarity to 9E4 VK, retaining the same canonical structures for the loops.
1H3P (Pizarro et al., FEBS Lett. 509:463-8, 2001) was used for the Vh structure. It
had good overall sequence similarity and reasonable resolution (2.6A), but also had
the same length CDR-H3 with a kinked base. In addition, CDRs-H 1 and H2 had the
same canonical structures as 9E4 Vh. DeepView/Swiss-PdvViewer 3.7 (SP5) (Guex
and Peitsch, Electrophoresis 18: 2714-2723, 1997) was used structure modeling.
[0129]    A search of the non-redundant protein sequence database from NCBI
allowed selection of suitable human frameworks into which to graft the murine CDRs.
For VK, a human kappa light chain with NCBI accession code AAY33350
(GI:63102889) (Kramer et al., Eur J Immunol. 35:2131-45, 2005) was chosen. It has
the same canonical classes for CDR-L2 and L3 as 9E4, and belongs to human
germline IGKV1D-39 or IGKV1-39 (clone name 02 or 012) according to IMGT
convention. It is a member of Kabat human kappa subgroup 1. For Vh, human Ig
heavy chain with NCBI accession code AAC50998 (GI:1791009) (Glas et al., Clin
Exp Immunol. 107:372-80, 1997) was chosen, again with the same canonical classes
as 9E4 and belonging to human germline IGHV3-7'01 or IGHV3-7'02 (clones name
V3-7 or VH3-1 1). It is a member of Kabat human heavy subgroup 3.
[0130]    The following positions differing between the human acceptor and mouse
donor variable region frameworks were identified as being candidates for
backmutation. H73 is on the edge of the antigen binding site and interacts with CDR
H2. H93 is an interface residue that lies beneath the CDR-H1 and H3 loops. L36 is a
VK/Vh interface residue. L83 is in close proximity to the constant domain. In 9E4,
L83 is a leucine, whereas in human framework, L83 is a larger amino acid
phenylalanine.
[01311    Three humanized heavy chains and three humanized light chains are made
incorporating back mutations at different permutations of these positions (Figs. 1A, B,
sequence alignment, and Tables 2-3).

EXAMPLE II.              Passive Immunization with a-synuclein antibodies
[0142]     The goal of this experiment is to determine effectiveness of c-synuclein
antibodies in in vitro and in vivo studies as well as behavioral assays. We used a
synuclein transgenic (Line 61), x-synuclein knockout and wildtype female mice, 3-4
months old at initiation and n=14/group. Antibodies tested included 9E4 (IgG1,
epitope: amino acids 118-126 of alpha synuclein), 5CI (IgG1, epitope: amino acids
118-126 of alpha synuclein, c-linker), 5D12, IgG2 (SN118-126), 1H7, IgGI (SN 91
99) and an IgG 1 control antibody 27-1. Mice received a dosage of 10 mg/kg over a 5
month period, for a total of 21 injections. In addition, the animals were injected with
lentivirus (LV) expressing human ax-synuclein (wt) by unilateral introduction of
human a-synuclein (wt) into the hippocampus.
                                             34

[0143]    Readout antibodies include those from Chemicon (epitope: full-length alpha
synuclein), Millipore (epitope: full-length alpha synuclein), and Neotope, ELADW
105 (epitope: amino acids 121-124 of full-length alpha synuclein).
[0144]    Endpoints: Antibody titers were measured during the in life phase.
Behavioral assays include Morris Water Maze test (MWW) and horizontal beam test.
The round beam test is a test of motor balance, coordination and gait conducted using
two beams of varying diameter. Beam A is the larger diameter (easier, considered the
training beam) and Beam D is the smaller diameter (more difficult, considered the
testing beam). Data is presented as "errors" (number of slips/10cm) and "speed"
(time taken to travel IOcm/sec). Water maze performance was carried out at weeks
10 and termination. The following neuropathology measurements were taken: alpha
synuclein aggregation, synaptophysin, and MAP2. The following biochemistry
measurements were taken: alpha synuclein, PSD95, synaptophysin. Selected
multilabeling and confocal labeling were carried out using synaptic, neuronal and
glial markers.
[01451    The results showed that all antibodies, except 5D12, produced significant
reduction in o-syn accumulation and preservation of synaptic and dendritic densities,
as well as positive outcomes in MWM performance. The 9E4 antibody is effective in
in vitro and in vivo studies as well as behavioral assays. Readouts indicate antibody
may reduce neuritic/axonal alpha synuclein aggregates.
[01461    Behavioral Results: The 9E4 antibody improved water maze performance
in a-synuclein transgenic mice (Figures 3-4). In contrast, the 5D12 antibody did not
improve water maze performance in a-synuclein transgenic mice (Figure 4). The 9E4
and 1H7 antibodies improved performance on the beam test as measured both by
speed and errors, whereas the 5D12 and 5CI antibodies did not (Figure 4).
[0147]    Neuropathology Results: The 9E4, 1H7 and 5CI antibodies reduced
ELADW-105 positive neuritic dystrophy, whereas the 5D12 antibody did not. In
alpha synuclein transgenic mice, the 9E4 antibody reduced the area of neuropil by
43% in neocortex and by 40% in basal ganglia as compared to control. The 9E4
antibody also preserved synaptophysin and MAP2 in neocortex and basal ganglia.
EXAMPLE III.                    Immunoprecipitation
[0148]    Immunoprecipitation was performed to test the binding efficacy of various
versions of humanized 9E4 antibodies towards its antigen taken from diseased tissue
                                            35

(Figure 5). 150 Vig of Tris-soluble brain lysates from Dementia with Lewy Body
brains were immunoprecipitated with 5 [tg of each indicated antibody using Protein G
magnetic beads (New England Biolabs). Samples were washed 5 times with PBS/350
mM NaCl/0.5% NP-40, boiled, and the resulting samples resolved by SDS-PAGE.
After blotting, membranes were incubated with Ab5038 (Millipore), a polyclonal
antibody that detects total synuclein. The experiment was repeated three times to
confirm accuracy.
EXAMPLE IV.                      Western blot
10149]    Western blotting of recombinant human synuclein with mouse, chimeric and
humanized 9E4 antibodies is shown in Figure 6. Antibody dilution curves were
apparently similar for mouse, chimeric and humanized 9E4 antibodies. All antibodies
detected a band at 28 KDa and a second band at 49 kDa. The 49 kDa band is likely a
multimer of synuclein.
[01501    Indicated amounts of recombinant, bacterially-expressed human wild-type
synuclein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blotted with identical amounts of the
indicated form of 9E4. After washing, species-appropriate goat polyclonal antibodies
conjugated to the IRDye-800 fluorophor were applied, and the blot was washed.
Exposure times were identical for the different antibodies.
