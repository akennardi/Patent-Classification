   TITLE OF INVENTION
                  Medical Tablet, and Manufacturing Method and Manufacturing Apparatus for Medical
 5 Tablet
                  The entire content of the complete specification of Australian Patent Application
   No. 2013364943 as originally filed is incorporated herein by reference.
   TECHNICAL FIELD
                  The present invention relates to a medical tablet, and a manufacturing method and a
10 manufacturing apparatus for a medical tablet. More specifically, it relates to a medical tablet
   containing an IC chip, and a manufacturing method and manufacturing apparatus for the
   medical tablet.
   BACKGROUND ART
                  There is a core-containing tablet as a kind of a tablet for use in a medicine and the like.
15 This core-containing tablet includes a nucleated tablet and a covering portion in a periphery
   thereof. Generally, a nucleated tablet and a covering portion are composed of different kinds
   of medicines or pharmaceutical compositions each other, and a nucleated tablet is buried in a
   tablet center. When a nucleated tablet is not located at a center of a tablet, not only a loss or
   crack may occur in a covering portion, but also expression of an expected efficacy is disturbed,
20 or an unexpected side reaction may occur. As described above, the positioning of the
   nucleated tablet may greatly affect a quality of a core-containing tablet. As a tablet
   manufacturing apparatus which manufactures this kind of core-containing tablet, there is for
   example a rotational core-containing tablet manufacturing machine as disclosed in PTD 1.
                  This rotational core-containing tablet manufacturing machine has a basic configuration
25 to fill pharmaceutical powder into a plurality of die holes provided at predetermined intervals
   on a circumference along an outer edge portion of a rotating disk rotating at a high speed,
   supply a nucleated tablet onto pharmaceutical powder, further fill pharmaceutical powder onto
   the nucleated tablet, and thereafter compress and shape these pharmaceutical powders and
   nucleated tablet by means of a lower pestle and an upper pestle.
                                                                  -1 -

           In the apparatus disclosed in PTD 1, a supplying apparatus which supplies a
   nucleated tablet is devised for the purpose of positioning a nucleated tablet at a tablet
   center.   A plurality of plate springs (23) are radially or diagonally radially mounted on
   a transfer disk (14), and a nucleated tablet insertion pin (27) is attached to the free end
 5 thereof and located above a nucleated tablet holding portion (15) of transfer disk (14).
   A push-down roller (39) is provided which comes into contact with a head (29) of
   nucleated tablet insertion pin (27) and pushes down the same when nucleated tablet
   holding portion (15) of transfer disk (14) and die hole (4) of a rotating disk (5) overlap
   each other.    The nucleated tablet is forced by nucleated tablet insertion pin (27) at a
10 predetermined timing and then dropped and supplied.          As illustrated above, an
   operation timing of nucleated tablet insertion pin (27) is set to be a timing of
   overlapping nucleated tablet holding portion (15) and die hole (4), so that the dropped
   nucleated tablet is dropped onto a center of pharmaceutical powder already filling die
   hole (4).   It should be noted that the numbers in parenthesis are reference characters
15 disclosed in the publication of the patent document.

   SUMMARY OF INVENTION
   TECHNICAL PROBLEM
           Now, an IC chip-containing tablet having an IC chip buried in a tablet is
   considered.     The IC chip-containing tablet has a medicine at an outer peripheral wall
25 of the IC chip.    Assuming that this IC chip is a nucleated tablet, it is supposed that an
   IC chip is supplied so as to be positioned at a center of a tablet with use of the above
   described conventional apparatus.      In that case, it was indeed difficult to supply an IC
   chip with a high accuracy to a center within appropriately filled powder due to the
   following reasons.
                                                -2-

           In other words, for example, as disclosed in paragraph [00231 of PTD I "...
   nucleated tablet C is dropped onto pharmaceutical powder first layer P1 filled in said
   die hole 4" or paragraph [0024] "a failure is less likely to occur in a dropping
   mechanism itself, so that accuracy and reproducibility of the dropping position of
 5 nucleated tablet C are improved," a nucleated tablet is dropped and supplied to
   pharmaceutical powder.       Therefore, when a nucleated tablet is replaced with an IC
   chip, there is a likelihood that the IC chip is not dropped smoothly and is dropped at a
   position displaced from a center.
           Moreover, for example, when a form of an IC chip to be buried is not
10 configured as a single body of a rectangular chip main body but is configured such that
   the chip main body is mounted to a film having a predetermined shape, a resistance
   applied to a film at the time of dropping may become greater, and the chip may not fall
   while maintaining a horizontal state, so that it may be set on a surface of
   pharmaceutical powder in a slanted state.      Moreover, in the case of the IC chip of a
15 type having a film in such a manner, even when the IC chip is appropriately dropped to
   a center of a surface of pharmaceutical powder, the chip may slip on the surface of
   pharmaceutical powder during the subsequent movement and therefore is likely to
   cause a positional displacement.
           On the other hand, the present inventor was conceived of supplying an IC chip
20 in a downward manner to pharmaceutical powder.          However, since this kind of IC
   chip is provided such that it is set in an accommodation portion provided in a carrier
   tape, in an upward manner with a chip main body facing upward, and is accommodated
   in an accommodation tape in which an opening side of the accommodation portion is
   covered with a top tape, the IC chip is in an upward manner when the top tape is peeled
25 off to open.    Therefore, since the IC chip cannot be directly supplied to
   pharmaceutical powder in a downward manner, it is necessary to reverse upside down
   on the course.
           For example, PTDs 2 and 3 disclose the invention of a reversing apparatus for
   an electronic component.      The apparatus disclosed in PTD 2 has rotatable suction
                                                -3-

   means arranged to face each other and passes items in a state where suction portions
   thereof face each other.    However, the apparatus disclosed in PTD 2 needs a separate
   transfer mechanism for reversing the item.       Therefore, the configuration is
   complicated.
 5          PTD 3 reverses an item by rotation of a head provided with upper and lower
   cover members which are slidable in a forward and backward direction.         However,
   since the cover member needs to open/close and slide, it is not suitable for a high-speed
   processing.    Further, in the case of a fine electronic component of, for example,
   several millimeters, holding by suction means cannot be performed firmly.         Therefore,
10 since the passing cannot be performed smoothly, an item is likely to be dropped.
            Moreover, in the case of a type provided with the above-described film, outside
   dimensions become greater, so that a difference with respect to dimensions of a tablet
   becomes smaller.      Therefore, even a slight displacement of a supply position to
   pharmaceutical powder may cause an IC chip to be forced out of a tablet.         Higher
15 accuracy in the supply position is required as a problem.
            Moreover, the rotational core-containing tablet manufacturing machine
   disclosed in PTD I employs a configuration in which a tabletting machine measuring
   pharmaceutical powder, placing a desired quantity of the pharmaceutical powder in a
   die, pressing the pharmaceutical powder placed in the die from above and below to
20 form a predetermined shape of the tablet is integrated with a nucleated tablet supply
   apparatus supplying a nucleated tablet with respect to pharmaceutical powder, and,
   above a rotating plate equipped with the die, the nucleated tablet supply apparatus
   rotating together with rotation of the rotating plate is arranged.   On the other hand,
   when a nucleated tablet supply apparatus is provided separately from a tabletting
25 machine, a region in which an IC chip can be supplied into the die of the tabletting
   machine having pharmaceutical powder placed therein may be limited.          Consequently,
   it is necessary to supply an IC chip appropriately with use of a narrow space, and there
   is a likelihood that a space for mounting a inspection apparatus which performs
   inspection on whether or not an IC chip is located at a center of pharmaceutical powder
                                                -4-

   cannot be reserved.     In such a case, there is a problem that it would be necessary to
   supply the IC chip at a center position with higher accuracy.

   DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
          Fig. l is a front view representing a favorable one embodiment of a tablet
   manufacturing apparatus according to the present invention.     Figs. 2 and 3 are plan
                                              -15-

   views thereof    Figs. 4A to 4C are diagrams for explaining an IC chip to be supplied in
   the present embodiment.     Drawings subsequent to Fig. 4A are enlarged views of each
   portion of the apparatus and diagrams for explaining an effect.
            As shown in Figs. I to 3, tablet manufacturing apparatus according to the
 5 present embodiment includes a tabletting machine 2, and a supply apparatus 3 which
   conveys and supplies an IC chip to tabletting machine 2.        An IC chip 4 conveyed and
   supplied by the present embodiment       has a form in which a chip main body 6 is
   mounted at a center position of a circular base film 5 as shown in Figs. 4A to 4C.
   Base film 5, for example, has a disk-like outer diameter of 3.5 mm, and, for example,
10 includes a function for supporting chip main body 6, an antenna function for
   communicating information with outside, and the like.        Chip main body 6, for
   example, has a rectangular outer shape of 1 mm square, and an electronic circuit is
   incorporated therein.   Chip main body 6 includes, for example, a storage portion for
   storing information specifying a tablet into which IC chip 4 is buried, a function for
15 transmitting information stored in the storage portion at a predetermined timing, and
   the like.
            As shown in Figs. 4A and 4B, IC chips 4 having the above-described
   configuration are arranged in one line with predetermined intervals on a belt-like
   accommodation tape 7.      Accommodation tape 7 includes a carrier tape 8 having
20 accommodation recesses Sa formed at predetermined intervals and a top tape 9
   covering an upper surface carrier tape 8.     IC chip 4 is accommodated in
   accommodation recess 8a.      In Fig. 4B, as illustrated on the right side, an upper part of
   accommodation recess 8a is opened by peeling top tape 9 from carrier tape 8, so that
   accommodated IC chip 4 can be taken out.         IC chip 4 is accommodated in
25 accommodation recess 8a in a state of being in an upward manner where chip main
   body 6 is located above.   Further, accommodation tape 7 has feed holes 7a formed at
   even pitches along one side edge.     This accommodation tape 7 is reeled up by a supply
   reel 10.
                                               -16-

            Supply apparatus 3 includes a rotary support shaft II for freely rotatably
   bearing-supporting supply reel 10, which is configured to reel up accommodation tape
   7 described above in a rolled formed on its front face, and supply reel 10 is set on
   rotary support shaft 11.    Supply apparatus 3 includes various rollers 12 for defining
 5 conveying routes of accommodation tape 7, separated carrier tape 8, and top tape 9 on
   their front faces, accommodation tape opening portion 13 capable of peeling top tape 9
   from carrier tape 8 and taking out IC chip 4 accommodated in accommodation tape 7, a
   carrier tape collecting portion 14 for collecting carrier tape 8 from which IC chip 4 is
   taken out, and a top tape collecting portion 15 for collecting top tape 9.
10          Accommodation tape opening portion 13 includes a guide plate 17 constituting
   a conveying passage arranged in a horizontal direction at a predetermined position
   thereabove, a pair sprockets 18 arranged in front and back in the conveying direction of
   accommodation tape 7 of guide plate 17, and a peeling plate 19 arranged at a
   predetermined position above guide plate 17.
15          As shown in Figs. SA to 5C in enlargement, guide plate 17 has a concave
   groove extending in an axial direction in an upper surface.     A width of concave
   groove 17a is equal to or slightly larger than a tape width of accommodation tape 7.
   Therefore, accommodation tape 7 passes through concave groove 17a, so that it stably
   moves forward without any lateral displacement.       Further, as shown in Figs. 5A to 5C
20 and Fig. 6, in a section on an upstream side of guide plate 17, a slit 17b is provided in a
   bottom portion of concave groove 17a, and slit 17b is communicated to a connection
   pipe 17c mounted to a lower surface of guide plate 17.       Connection pipe 17c is
   coupled to a suction pump not illustrated in the drawings.     Accordingly, the part at
   which slit 17b is opened in the bottom surface of concave groove 17a causes a negative
25 pressure to suction accommodation tape 7, so that stable conveyance can be performed.
            Moreover, sprockets 18 have protrusions ISa at a predetermined pitch on its
   circumferential surface.    When accommodation tape 7 is placed over sprockets 18,
   protrusions 18a penetrate through feed holes 7a of accommodation tape 7 and protrudes
   above accommodation tape 7.       Accordingly, when sprockets 18 are rotated,
                                               -17-

   protrusions 18a within feed holes 7a gives a conveying force to accommodation tape 7,
   and accommodation tape 7 follows it and moves forward by a predetermined amount.
   When sprockets 18 are stopped, the forward movement of accommodation tape 7 is
   also stopped.     Sprockets 18 are in conjunction with an unillustrated drive motor such
 5 as a servo motor capable of controlling a rotational angle, and an intermittent driving is
   controlled at a predetermined timing.
            As schematically shown in Fig. 4B, a peeling plate 19 includes a reference
   surface 19a arranged in parallel with a conveyance surface of accommodation tape 7,
   and a slope surface 19b sloping in a diagonally rearward and upward direction from
10 reference surface 19a.    Accommodation tape 7 passes through sprocket 18 on an
   upstream side, and thereafter passes through a location between guide plate 17 and
   peeling plate 19, and top tape 9 is bent back from reference surface 19a to slope surface
    19b of peeling plate 19 and peeled from carrier tape 8.     Accordingly, carrier tape 8 is
   opened on an upper side of accommodation recess 8a.          Then, carrier tape 8 is guided
15 by guide plate 17 and moves horizontally.
            It should be noted that, carrier tape 8 passes through accommodation tape
   opening portion 13 and thereafter passes through a predetermined passage to reach
   carrier tape collecting portion 14, and is taken up and collected by a take-up reel.
   Similarly, peeled top tape 9 also passes through a predetermined passage to reach top
20 tape collecting portion 15, and is taken up and collected by a take-up reel.
            Above accommodation tape opening portion 13, IC chip take-out apparatus 20
   is provided.    This IC chip take-out apparatus 20 has a function of taking out IC chip 4
   accommodated in opened accommodation tape 7, reversing an manner up and down,
   and passing it to conveying apparatus 21 in a next stage.      In the present embodiment,
25 two front and back IC chips 4 accommodated in accommodation tape 7 are taken out
   collectively.    Therefore, sprockets 18 and the like are operated so as to intermittently
   convey accommodation tape 7 by a pitch corresponding to two IC chips 4, and
   performs a control of temporarily stopping IC chip 4 in a state of being located at a
   take-out position of take-out apparatus 20.
                                                -18-

           Then, IC chip take-out apparatus 20 includes a first suction and hold member 22
   for taking out IC chip 4 accommodated in accommodation tape 7 and reversing up and
   down of IC chip 4, and a second suction and hold member 23 for receiving IC chip 4
   taken out and reversed by first suction and hold member 22 and supplying it to
 5 conveying apparatus 21.
           First suction and hold member 22 has two first suction nozzle portions 22b
   formed to protrude at a leading end of an elongated belt-like main body 22a.       An
   arrangement interval of two first suction nozzle portions 22b matches with an
   arrangement pitch of IC chips 4 in accommodation tape 7.         The leading ends of first
10 suction nozzle portions 22b are opened, and the opened parts are in communication
   with main body 22a and suction passages 22c formed within first suction nozzle
   portions 22b, and connected to a suction pump not illustrated in the drawing.
           Moreover, this first suction and hold member 22 is configured to move up and
   down and rotate within a vertical plane.     As illustrated in enlargement in Figs. 5A to
15 5C, this first suction and hold member 22 is bearing-supported through a bearing 28
   with respect to a moving plate 26 moving up and down, and moves up and down with
   moving plate 26.      On a back side of moving plate 26, sliders 24 are attached which is
   mounted to two guide rails 25 extending upward and downward so as to be movable up
   and down.      Moving plate 26 is guided by guide rails 25 and sliders 24 to stably move
20 up and down.      A drive mechanism for allowing moving plate 26 to move up and down
   is configured such that one end of a belt plate-like coupling plate 31 is coupled to an
   eccentric position of a rotating plate 30 receiving a rotational force of drive motor 33 to
   rotate, and the other end of coupling plate 31 is coupled to moving plate 26.
   Accordingly, rotating plate 30 is rotated, so that coupling plate 31 and moving plate 26
25 move up and down.        Then, moving plate 26 reciprocates between the lifted position
   shown in Figs. I and SA to SC and a lowered position shown in Fig. 6.
           Moreover, on a back side of moving plate 26, a drive motor 32 as a drive source
   for rotating first suction and hold member 22 is attached, and drive motor 32 also
   moves up and down integrally with moving plate 26.         A rotational shaft 34
                                               -19-

   cooperating with an output shaft of drive motor 32 is mounted to bearing 28 arranged
   so as to protrude to a front side of moving plate 26, and first suction and hold member
   22 is fixed to a leading end of rotational shaft 34.    Accordingly, rotation of drive
   motor 32 causes first suction and hold member 22 to rotate.       First suction and hold
 5 member 22 temporarily stops rotation in a passing manner having a leading end facing
   upward as shown in Figs. I and SA to 5C, and a take-out posture having a leading end
   facing downward as shown in Fig. 6.
            Accordingly, when drive motors 32, 33 are controlled appropriately to allow
   first suction and hold member 22 to be moved downward in a state of a take-out
10 manner of facing downward and located at a lowered position, a leading end of first
   suction nozzle portion 22b comes into contact with IC chip 4 within accommodation
   tape 7 (Figs. 6, 7A, and 8A).     When first suction nozzle portion 22b communicates
   with an unillustrated suction pump in this state, suction is performed by first suction
   nozzle portion 22b, so that first suction nozzle portion 22b suctions and holds IC chip 4.
15          Next, when moving plate 26 is moved up while having first suction and hold
   member 22 in a state of a take-out manner facing downward, first suction nozzle
   portion 22b of first suction and hold member 22 is located above accommodation tape
   7 in a state of suctioning and holding IC chip 4.     Accordingly, an operation of taking
   out IC chip 4 from accommodation tape 7 is completed.          Then, moving plate 26 and
20 first suction and hold member 22 further moves up to reach the lifted position.      Before
   reaching this lifted position, first suction and hold member 22 receives driving of drive
   motor 32 to rotate by 180 degrees, and shifts to a passing manner facing upward.
   Accordingly, IC chip 4 suctioned by first suction nozzle portion 22b of first suction and
   hold member 22 is reversed up and down, an manner of facing downward is taken in
25 which chip main body 6 is located on a lower side of base film 5.
            As shown in Figs. 5A to 5C and 7B, a cylindrical guide 40 is arranged at an
   existing position of first suction nozzle portion 22b of first suction and hold member 22
   at the time when first suction and hold member 22 is in a passing manner of facing
   upward and located at the lifted position.     This cylindrical guide 40 is coupled to a
                                                - 20 -

   machine frame through a support plate 48 extending in a horizontal direction and is
   fixedly arranged at a desired position.    Cylindrical guide 40 includes two through
   holes 41 extending upward and downward.         Two through-holes 41 have parallel axis
   centers, and a pitch between axes matches with an arrangement pitch of first suction
 5 nozzle portion 22b.    Moreover, each through-hole 41 has an inlet region 41a at a lower
   end, a center region 41b, and an outlet region 41c at an upper end.      Inner diameter
   dimensions of inlet region 4 1a and outlet region 41 c are set to be sufficiently greater
   than outer shape dimensions of IC chip 4, and inner shape dimensions of center region
   41b are set to be substantially equal to or greater than outside dimensions of IC chip 4.
10 Further, an inner circumferential surface of center region 41b is a tapered surface
   having a narrowest center in an up/down direction.        Then, when first suction and hold
   member 22 moves up while being in a state of a passing manner facing upward, first
   suction nozzle portion 22b enters inlet region 41a from a lower end of cylindrical guide
   40 to reach a lifted position, a leading end of first suction nozzle portion 22b is located
15 within center region 41b.     More specifically, it is located near a narrowest center
   position within center region 41b.     Accordingly, the entering of IC chip 4 suctioned
   and held by first suction nozzle portion 22b into cylindrical guide 40 passes through
   inlet region 40a having a relatively large room and moves within center region 41b
   having a gradually reduced inner diameter, so that it can move smoothly to the lifted
20 position.
            On the other hand, second suction and hold member 23 includes a first main
   body 23a and a second main body 23b which come close to and separate from each
   other in a horizontal direction.   Leading ends of first and second main bodies      23a,
   23b respectively have second suction nozzle portions 23c.        An arrangement space of
25 two second suction nozzle portions 23c in a state where first main body 23a        and
   second main body 23b come close to each other matches with an arrangement space of
   first suction nozzle portion 22b of first suction and hold member 22.      Further, the
   leading end of second suction nozzle portion 23c is opened, and the opening part
   communicates with first and second main bodies 23a, 23b, and suction passages 23d
                                               -21 -

   formed within second suction nozzle portions 23c and is connected to an unillustrated
   suction pump.
            Moreover, this second suction and hold member 23 is configured to move
   within a three dimensional space.       This movement is performed by a first robot 49.
 5 In other words, first robot 49 includes an arm 44 of a SCARA robot moving within a
   horizontal plane, a support rod 43 attached to a lower surface of a leading end of arm
   44 so as to be movable upward and downward, and a base 42 attached to a lower end of
   support rod 43.     The horizontal movement of arm 44 of this SCARA robot and the up
   and down movement of support rod 43 causes base 42 to be movable to a desired
10 position within the three dimensional space.         Then, first main body 23a and second
   main body 23b constituting second suction and hold member 23 is movably attached
   through a slider 23e to guide rail 42a provided on a lower surface of base 42.         This
   movement of first main body 23a and second main body 23b is performed, for example,
   by cylinder driving.     Accordingly, base 42 and second suction and hold member 23
15 supported on the lower surface thereof move within the three dimensional space.
   Further, first main body 23a and second main body 23b come close to and separate
   from each other along guide rail 42a.
            Specifically, second suction and hold member 23 moves to a position
   overlapping with cylindrical guide 40 on a horizontal plane in accordance with an
20 operation of arm 44 of the SCARA robot, and moves downward while maintaining that
   state, so that second suction and hold member 23 reaches a lowered position.           At this
   time, first main body 23a and second main body 23b are close to each other.           In this.
   state, as shown in Figs. SA to 5C, 7B, and 8B, second suction nozzle portion 23c enters
   outlet region 41c from an upper end of cylindrical guide 40.         Then, having reached a
25 lowermost end position, the leading end of second suction nozzle portion 23c is located
   within center region 41b.     In this state, it is controlled to come close to a leading end
   of first suction nozzle portion 22b of first suction and hold member 22 located at the
   lifted position by a certain clearance (for example, about 0.5 mm).
                                                 -  22 -

            Accordingly, IC chip 4 suctioned and held by first suction nozzle portion 22b
   waits in a state of being located in a center region 41 b of through-hole 41 of cylindrical
   guide 40, and a lower end of second suction nozzle portion 23c of second suction and
   hold member 23 having entered from above comes in contact with or close to IC chip 4.
 5 Then, suction with second suction nozzle portion 23c is started, and suction with first
   suction nozzle portion 22b is stopped at an appropriate timing, so that suctioning and
   holding of IC chip 4 is shifted to the side of second suction and hold member 23.
            As can be seen, the present embodiment is characterized in performing a
   transfer of IC chip 4 from first suction and hold member 22 to second suction and hold
10 member 23 within cylindrical guide 40.         Since IC chip 4 has a thin shape of base film
   5 with a small diameter of 3.5 mm, it cannot be firmly held by the suction and hold
   member.      Therefore, if passing between first suction and hold member 22 and second
   suction and hold member 23 is performed in a state where IC chip 4 is exposed, there is
   a likelihood that passing cannot be performed smoothly and IC chip 4 is dropped.
15 However, according to the present embodiment, the passing process is performed inside
   of cylindrical guide 40, so that the passing can be performed assuredly.
            After that, first suction and hold member 22 moves down while maintaining a
   passing manner.      When first suction nozzle portion 22b goes out of cylindrical guide
   40, first suction and hold member 22 rotates by 180 degrees to take a take-out manner
20 and returns to a lowered position at an appropriate timing, and prepares for taking out
   next IC chip.    On the other hand, second suction and hold member 23 which has
   received IC chip 4 moves up with support rod 43 moving up, and second suction nozzle
   portion 24 is located above cylindrical guide 40.      After that, an operation of arm 44 of
   the SCARA robot         causes second suction and hold member 23 to move in a horizontal
25 direction to reach a conveying position of conveying apparatus 21.
            As shown in Figs. 9A and 9B, conveying apparatus 21 includes a first receiving
   portion 45 and a second receiving portion 46 for receiving two IC chips 4 conveyed by
   second suction and hold member 23 suctioning and holding IC chips 4, and a drive
   mechanism 47 for moving these first receiving portion 45 and second receiving portion
                                                -  23 -

   46 forward and backward.      As shown in Fig. lOA and 10B by enlargement, first
   receiving portion 45 includes recesses 45b for accommodating IC chip 4 in upper
   surfaces of two bifurcated pillar portions 45a facing upward.     A space between pillar
   portions 45a (recesses 45b) is in conformity with a tabletting machine in a next stage
 5 and set to be longer than an arrangement pitch (an arrangement space of first suction
   nozzle portion 22b and second suction and hold member 23) of IC chips 4 in
   accommodation tape 7.      Moreover, a bottom surface of recess 45b communicates with
   a suction passage 45 formed within pillar portion 45a and is connected to an
   unillustrated suction pump.    Accordingly, IC chip 4 set within recess 45b is suctioned
10 and held within recess 45b.    Even when first receiving portion 45 moves forward, IC
   chip 4 moves forward with first receiving portion 45 while being set within recess 45b.
            Similarly, second receiving portion 46 includes recesses 46b accommodating IC
   chip 4 in an upper surface of two bifUrcated pillar portions 46a facing upward.     A
   space between pillar portions 46a (recesses 46b) is in conformity with a tabletting
15 machine in a next stage and set to be longer than an arrangement pitch (an arrangement
   space of first suction nozzle portion 22b and second suction and hold member 23) of IC
   chip 4 in accommodation tape 7.      Moreover, a bottom surface of recess 46b
   communicates with a suction passage 46c formed within pillar portion 46a and is
   connected to an unillustrated suction pump.     Accordingly, IC chip 4 set within recess
20 46b is suctioned and held within recess 46b.      Even when second receiving portion 46
   moves forward, IC chip 4 moves forward with second receiving portion 46 while being
   set in recess 46b.
            Drive mechanism 47 of first receiving portion 45 and second receiving portion
   46 includes a drive motor 50, and a rack 51 and a pinion 52 receiving an output of drive
25 motor 50 and converting it into a reciprocal linear motion.    First receiving portion 45
   and second receiving portion 46 cooperate with rack 51 respectively through coupling
   plates 53, 54 and move in a reverse direction.     In other words, second receiving
   portion 46 moves backward when first receiving portion 45 moves forward, and second
   receiving portion 46 moves backward when first receiving portion 45 moves forward.
                                              - 24 -

   In other words, for example, second receiving portion 46 is at a conveying-out position
   when first receiving portion 45 is at a conveying-in position.   Moreover, for example,
   second receiving portion 46 is at a conveying-in position when first receiving portion
   45 is at a conveying-out position.    Moreover, sliders 55 are coupled to a lower surface
 5 of coupling plate 53 and an upper surface of coupling plate 54.    This sliders 55 are
   mounted respectively to corresponding guide rails 56 and guide a forward and
   backward movement of rack 51 and each receiving portion 45, 46 along with rotation
   of pinion 52.
            Second suction and hold member 23 having received IC chip 4 moves on a
10 horizontal plane by means of arm 44 of the SCARA robot and is located above first
   receiving portion 45 or second receiving portion 46 located at the conveying-in position.
   As described above, since first receiving portion 45 and second receiving portion 46
   move forward and backward in directions opposite to each other, first robot 49 controls
   an operation of arm 44 of the SCARA robot to allow second suction and hold member
15 23 to be positioned alternately above the conveying-in position of first receiving
   portion 45 and the conveying-in position of second receiving portion 46.
            As described above, since a space between pillar portions 45a (recesses 45b) of
   first receiving portion 45 and a space between pillar portions 46a (recesses 46b) of
   second receiving portion 46 are widened, first robot 49, during the horizontal
20 movement of second suction and hold member 23 by means of arm 44 of the SCARA
   robot or at the time of being located above the conveying-in position, controls first
   main body 23a and second main body 23b of second suction and hold member 23 to be
   separated from each other to widen the space of second suction nozzle portion 23c.
   The widened space of second suction nozzle portion 23c is set to be equal to the space
25 of recesses 45b, 46b.
            Then, in such a state where first main body 23a and second main body 23b are
   separated from each other, when support rod 43 is moved downward, as shown in Fig.
   1OA for example, a lower end of second suction nozzle portion 23c of second suction
   and hold member 23 enters recesses 45b of first receiving portion 45, so that IC chip 4
                                               - 25 -

   suctioned and held in a downward manner is set within the recess 45b.        Then, when
   the suction on the side of second suction and hold member 23 is released at an
   appropriate timing, IC chip 4 is transferred to recesses 45b of first receiving portion 45.
   Moreover, first receiving portion 45 starts suction in advance or at an appropriate
 5 timing, and suctions and holds IC chip 4 within recessed 45b.
            Second suction and hold member 23 having completed a supply of IC chip 4 to
   first receiving portion 45 in such a manner returns to a receiving position within
   cylindrical guide 40 by an operation of first robot 49, and supplies the next passed IC
   chip to recess 46b of second receiving portion 46.
10          On the other hand, first receiving portion 45 having received the supply of IC
   chip 4 moves forward and is located at a conveying-out position.       IC chip 4 within
   recess 45b of first receiving portion 45 having reached the conveying-out position is
   suctioned and held by second robot 70 and transferred to tabletting machine 2.
   Second robot 70 includes an arm 71 of the SCARA robot moving within a horizontal
15 plane, a support member 72 attached to a leading end lower surface of arm 71 so as to
   be movable upward and downward, and a pair of suction nozzle portions 73 attached to
   the lower end of support member 72.       A leading end of third suction nozzle portion 73
   is opened, and the opened part communicates with suction passage 73a formed within
   third suction nozzle portion 73 and is connected to an unillustrated suction pump.
20 Then, the horizontal movement of arm 71 of the SCARA robot and the upward and
   downward movement of support member 72 causes third suction nozzle portions 73 to
   be movable to a desired position within a three dimensional space.      Further, a space of
   the pair of third suction nozzle portions 73 is in conformity with an arrangement space
   between pillar portions 45a (recesses 45b) of first receiving portion 45 and an
25 arrangement space between pillar portions 46a (recesses 46b) of second receiving
   portion 46.
            Accordingly, suction by means of a suction pump is performed in a state where
   a lower end of third suction nozzle portion 73 has reached within recess 45b of first
   receiving portion 45 or recess 46b of second receiving portion 46 located at the
                                               - 26 -

   conveying-out position by means of an operation of second robot 70.           When the
   suction by means of a vacuum pump on the side of first receiving portion 45 or second
   receiving portion 46 is released, IC chip 4 is suctioned and held on the side of third
   suction nozzle portion 73 (refer to Fig. 10B).
 5          Next, when third suction nozzle portion 73 suctioning and holding IC chip 4 is
   moved upward, horizontally, and downward by an operation of second robot 70, as
   shown in Figs. 2 and 1 IB, it is located within an IC chip receiving portion 79 of a
   rotary table 75 of an IC chip supply apparatus 74 arranged on the conveying-in side of
   tabletting machine 2.      When the suction of third suction nozzle portion 73 is released
10 in this state, IC chip 4 is supplied to IC chip receiving portion 79.
            Tabletting machine 2 includes the above-described IC chip supply apparatus 74
   and a tabletting machine main body 76.         Tabletting machine main body 76 is similar
   to a conventionally existing tabletting machine which fills pharmaceutical powder into
   a plurality of die holes 78 arranged at predetermined intervals on a circumference along
15 an outer edge portion of rotating plate 77 and compresses and shapes the filled
   pharmaceutical powder by means of a lower pestle and an upper pestle to manufacture
   tablets.   In the present embodiment, to manufacture an IC chip-containing tablet, a
   function of supplying IC chip 4 by means of IC chip supply apparatus 74 onto a
   predetermined amount of pharmaceutical powder supplied into die hole 78, further
20 supplying pharmaceutical powder onto         IC chip 4, and compressing and shaping these
   pharmaceutical powder and IC chip from above and below function is provided.
   Details of manufacturing processes of tablets will be described later.
            IC chip supply apparatus 74 as a main part of the present invention includes
   rotary table 75 as described above, and aligns IC chips 4 supplied to rotary table 75
25 within die holes 78 of tabletting machine main body 76.          Rotary table 75 receives a
   rotational force of drive motor 60 to rotate.      In the present embodiment, it is controlled
   to rotate intermittently at 90 degrees intervals.      Moreover, rotary table 75 includes
   protruding parts 75b protruding outward at 90 degrees intervals on an outer
   circumference of a plate-like main body 75a.          This protruding part 75b is provided
                                                -  27  -

   with IC chip receiving portions 79.     From the side of supply apparatus 3, IC chips 4
   are supplied in increments of two, so that two IC chip receiving portions 79 are
   provided at each protruding part 75b.     In the present embodiment, a position rotated
   by 180 degrees from an IC chip receiving position from supply apparatus 3 on an
 5 upstream side is a supplying position of IC chips 4 to tabletting machine main body 76.
   Then, it is temporarily stopped at a position rotated by 90 degrees from the IC chip
   receiving position.   At this time, for example, it is favorable to provide an inspection
   apparatus which performs an inspection on whether or not IC chips are correctly
   supplied to IC chip receiving portion 59.
10         As shown in Fig. 12 by enlargement, a through-hole 75b' is provided which
   penetrates up and down at a specified position of protruding part 75b of rotary table 75,
   and a positioning guide 61 is mounted to through-hole 75b.        This positioning guide 61
   constitutes IC chip receiving portion 59.     Positioning guide 61 has a ring-like shape as
   a basic shape having a through hole penetrating up and down as also shown in Figs.
15 13A to 13C.
           Positioning guide 61 includes a flange portion protruding radially outward at an
   upper circumferential side surface of cylindrical main body 62, and a convex portion 63
   protruding upward is provided at a center of the upper surface of main body 62.
   Convex portion 63 includes a flat surface 63a on it side surface.     Convex portion 63 is
20 inserted into through-hole 75b' of protruding part 75b, and flange portion 63 is
   sandwiched and held by protruding part 75b and main body 75a.          Accordingly,
   movement in an axial direction of positioning guide 61, in other words, movement in
   an up/down direction is prevented, so that separation of positioning guide 61 from
   rotary table 75 is prevented.   Further, an inner circumferential surface shape of
25 through-hole 75b' of protruding part 75b is set to be substantially match with an outer
   circumferential surface shape of convex portion 63 of positioning guide 61.
   Accordingly, rotation of positioning guide 61 about an axis is prevented.      Therefore,
   positioning guide 61 is held at a correct position and in a correct manner by rotary table
   75.
                                               - 28 -

            Through-hole 66 provided in positioning guide 61 is         set to be a tapered
   surface 66a having a circular cross section in an upper region with a diameter gradually
   increasing as it goes upward.      This upper region is a region in which convex portion
   63 is mainly formed.      An inner diameter of through-hole 66 at an upper end of convex
 5 portion 63 is set to be larger than an outer diameter of IC chip 4.       IC chip 4 suctioned
   and held by third suction nozzle portion 73 enters into through-hole 66 of positioning
   guide 61 in accordance with a downward movement of third suction nozzle portion 73
   while tapered surface 66a guides the entering and prompts a smooth downward
   movement.
10          Moreover, the inner circumferential surface in the portion of main body 62 of
   through-hole 66 forms a plurality of protrusions 67 protruding toward a center.          In the
   present embodiment, five protrusions 67 are provided.          However, the number may be,
   for example, three, or other suitable number may be used.          The leading end position of
   protrusion 67 is set to be located on an imaginary circumference being concentric with
15 through-hole 66 and having a predetermined diameter.           This predetermined diameter
   is set be equal to or slightly smaller than a diameter of IC chip 4.       Accordingly, a
   circumferential edge of IC chip 4 inserted into through-hole 66 of positioning guide 61
   is supported by protrusion 67 and held in a state where a center of IC chip 4 and a
   center of positioning guide 61 (through-hole 66) are matched.          Accordingly, the
20 positioning is performed with a high accuracy.         Moreover, it is preferable to
   manufacture positioning guide 61 with an elastic body such as rubber since it can hold
   IC chip 4 more firmly.      Further, preferably, protrusion 67 is arranged at equal intervals
   in the circumferential direction.     It is preferable since IC chips 4 are supported evenly.
            Further, in the present embodiment, a push-in portion 64 protruding downward
25 is provided at a lower surface of main body 62.         A planar shape of this push-in portion
   64 is substantially elliptical as shown in Fig. 13C.      In this example, both ends on the
   large-diameter side of the elliptical shape is collapsed to be flat.      The planar shape of
   this push-in portion 64 is based on a shape of a tablet to be manufactured and is formed
   to be slightly smaller than that of the tablet.     In other words, it has a shape which is
                                                  - 29 -

   slightly smaller than a cross sectional shape of die hole 78 formed in tabletting machine
   main body 76.     Moreover, a circumferential surface of push-in portion 64 has a
   tapered surface 64a which is smaller on a lower side.      Further, in the present
   embodiment, protrusion 67 formed on the inner circumferential surface of through-hole
 5 66 is formed to a lower end of this push-in portion 64.
            Next, an operation of supplying IC chip 4 from supply apparatus 3 to IC chip
   supply apparatus 74 and an operation of supplying IC chip 4 to tabletting machine 2
   will be described, and a configuration of IC chip supply apparatus 74 will be described.
   Figs. 14A and 15A show a state where a leading end of third suction nozzle portion 73
10 of supply apparatus 3 is inserted into positioning guide 61 constituting IC chip
   receiving portion 59.    As shown in the drawings, second suction and hold member 23
   moves downward, and the leading end of third suction nozzle portion 73 in a state of
   suctioning and holding IC chip 4 enters into through-hole 66 of positioning guide 61
   and stops at an appropriate position of main body 62.      At this appropriate position, IC
15 chip 4 is supported by protrusion 67.     Since the suction by third suction nozzle portion
   73 is performed until reaching this stopping position, IC chip 4 moves downward while
   maintaining a horizontal state in a downward manner where chip main body 6 is
   located on a lower side, IC chip 4 is in contact with a plurality of protrusions 67 in a
   horizontal manner at a lower stopping position of third suction nozzle portion 73.
20          Next, the suction by third suction nozzle portion 73 is released, and third
   suction nozzle portion 73 moves upward and is separated from positioning guide 61 to
   take next IC chip.    On the other hand, IC chip 4 in a downward manner remaining in
   positioning guide 61 is supported in a state of maintaining a horizontal manner by
   protrusions 67 of positioning guide 61.     Moreover, as described above, taking of a
25 center position of IC chip 4 is also performed at a high accuracy.
            The drawings subsequent to Fig. 14B and 15B shows a supplying position to
   tabletting machine 2 at which rotary table 75 is rotated by 180 degrees from the states
   of Figs. 14A and 15A.      At this supplying position, two pushers 82 are formed to be
   suspended on a lower surface of the leading end of an L-shaped plate 81 which receives
                                               - 30 -

   driving of a first cylinder 80 and moves up and down.          Two pushers 82 are in
   conformity with the arrangement pitch of two positioning guides 61 which are adjacent
   in the circumferential direction, and are adjusted so that an axis center of each
   positioning guide 61 and an axis center of pusher 82 are matched at the time when the
 5 rotary table is temporarily stopped.
           Further, first cylinder 80, L-shaped plate 81, pusher 82, and rotary table 75 can
   move up and down integrally.       Then, the up and down movement is performed by
   receiving driving of second cylinder 83.
           Accordingly, the position of rotary table 75 or pusher 82 can be changed by
10 appropriately switching the reciprocating operation of first cylinder 80 and second
   cylinder 83.    For example, Figs. 14B and 15B shows a state where first cylinder 80, L
   shaped plate 81, pusher 82, and rotary table 75 are positioned at the lifted position by
   means of second cylinder 83, and where pusher 82 is also positioned at the lifted
   position by means of first cylinder 80.      In this state, rotary table 75 is separated from
15 an upper surface of rotating plate 77 of tabletting machine main body 76, and
   positioning guide 61 is also separated from an upper surface of rotating plate 77.
   Moreover, the lower surface of pusher 82 is located above positioning guide 61, and
   pusher 82 and IC chip 4 in a downward manner supported by positioning guide 61 are
   in a non-contact state.    This state is an initial state of rotary table 75 which is rotated,
20 reached the supplying position, and temporarily stopped.
           Next, only second cylinder 83 is operated to allow first cylinder 80, L-shaped
   plate 81, pusher 82, and rotary table 75 to be positioned at the lowered position.         Then,
   as shown in Figs. 14C and 15C, rotary table 75 comes close to an upper surface of
   rotating plate 77 of tabletting machine main body 76, and a lower surface of main body
25 62 of positioning guide 61 comes into contact with an upper surface of rotating plate 77.
   Further, push-in portion 64 enters die hole 78, and comes into contact with
   pharmaceutical powder filled in die hole 78.        Moreover, at this time, since first
   cylinder 80 remains in the initial state, the relative positional relationship between
   pusher 82 and positioning guide 61 does not change, and the lower surface of pusher 82
                                                 -31 -

   is located above positioning guide 61, and pusher 82 and IC chip 4 in a downward
   manner supported by positioning guide 61 remain in a non-contact state.
            After that, first cylinder 80 is operated while second cylinder 83 maintains the
   above-described state, and pusher 82 moves downward.           Then, as shown in Figs. 14D
 5 and 15D, the lower end of pusher 82 reaches the lower end of positioning guide 61, in
   other words, the lower end of push-in portion 64, so that IC chip 4 is forced downward
   by pusher 82 and pushed out from positioning guide 61 and pushed into pharmaceutical
   powder 90.      Also at this downward movement of IC chip 4 by pusher 82, IC chip 4
   moves while maintaining a horizontal state and taking out of a center position by means
10 of protrusions 67 of positioning guide 61.       Accordingly, when IC chip 4 is pushed out
   from positioning guide 61 and finally pushed into pharmaceutical powder 90 to be
   supplied, it is supplied at a high accuracy to a center of a surface of pharmaceutical
   powder 90 filled in die hole 78.      Moreover, since IC chip 4 is pushed into
   pharmaceutical powder 90 before being compressed by pusher 82 of the tabletting
15 machine main body, the positional displacement is suppressed.
            Further, since IC chip 4 is pushed into pharmaceutical powder 90 in a
   downward manner where chip main body 6 is located on a lower side, chip main body
   6 is further inserted into pharmaceutical powder 90 with respect to the surface of
   pharmaceutical powder 90 in contact with, for example, base film 5. Therefore, even
20 when IC chip 4 attempts to move in the horizontal direction, chip main body 6 serves as
   a wedge, so that the positional displacement due to the movement in the lateral
   direction can be suppressed assuredly.
            Further, in the present embodiment, as described above, the horizontal state and
   the taking of the center position is performed at a high accuracy by means of
25 protrusions 67 of positioning guide 61.       Thus, since IC chip 4 can be supplied
   assuredly to the center of pharmaceutical powder 90, the taking of the position is
   ensured without performing an inspection on whether or not IC chip 4 is supplied to a
   correct position after the supply.     Accordingly, even in the case where an inspection
   apparatus is provided, it may be for example a simple sensor which        confirms
                                                 - 32 -

   presence of supply, so that an apparatus which cannot reserve a space region for
   providing the inspection apparatus can be used.
            Figs. 16A to 20C represent an operation of a main body of tabletting machine 2.
   As shown in Fig. 16A, on the lower side of die hole 78, a lower pestle 92 is fitted from
 5 a lower side in a slidably upward and downward.         As shown in Fig. 20A, on an upper
   side of die hole 78, an upper pestle 93 is provided so as to be movable up and down.
   As shown in Fig. 16A, firstly, in a state where lower pestle 92 is lowered in die hole 78,
   pharmaceutical powder filling apparatus 94 fills pharmaceutical powder 90 into die
   hole 78.    Next, as lower pestle 92 moves upward, a supply by pharmaceutical powder
10 filling apparatus 94 is cut, and a certain amount of pharmaceutical powder 90 is filled
   in a leveled state into a space of die hole 78 formed in an upper side of lower pestle 92
   (Fig. 16B).     After that, lower pestle 92 is lowered by a predetermined quantity, so that
   the surface of pharmaceutical powder 90 is slightly lowered from an upper surface of
   rotating plate 75 (Fig. 17A).
15          In this state, with IC chip supply apparatus 74 described above, positioning
   guide 61 having IC chip 4 set in a downward manner enters die hole 78 (Fig. 17B), and
   pusher 82 pushes out IC chip 4 and pushes it into pharmaceutical powder 90 (Fig. I8A).
            Next, rotating plate 75 is rotated to allow the die hole located at the supplying
   position to shift to the next step (Fig. 18B), and pharmaceutical powder 90 is filled into
20 die hole 78 by pharmaceutical powder filling apparatus 94 in a state where lower pestle
   92 is positioned on a lower side within die hole 78 (Fig. 19A).      Next, lower pestle 92
   is lifted, and a supply by pharmaceutical powder filling apparatus 94 is cut, and a
   certain amount of pharmaceutical powder 90 is filled in a space of die hole 78 formed
   on an upper side of lower pestle 92 in a leveled state (Fig. 19B).
25          Next, upper pestle 93 is lowered, and pharmaceutical powder 90 is compressed
   between upper pestle 93 and lower pestle 92 (Fig. 20A).        Accordingly, pharmaceutical
   powder 90 is solidified, so that IC chip-containing tablet 95 is manufactured (Fig. 20B).
   After that, lower pestle 92 is further moved upward, so that manufactured tablet 95 is
   discharged (Fig. 20C).       In a pharmaceutical tablet 95 containing IC chip 4 equipped
                                                 - 33 -

   with an IC, tablet 95 includes a first surface 95a and a second surface 95b spaced from
   each other in the up/down direction.       An engraved stamp or cleavage line 95c which is
   deeper than second surface 95b is formed in         first surface 95a. IC chip 4 has base
   film 5 as a base plane, and a chip main body 6 as a convex portion protruding greater
 5 on one side than the other side with respect to base film 5, and chip main body 6 is
   arranged within tablet 95 while facing the side of second surface 95b (Fig. 20D).            It is
   not always necessary to form an engraved stamp or a cleavage line in second surface
   95b.
            A tablet 95 as a medicine is often formed to have an engraved stamp or a
10 cleavage line representing a kind or a bland name.         Generally, such an engraved stamp
   or cleavage line95c is formed on one or both of upper and lower sides of tablet 95.
   Taking into consideration the mold release characteristics from a tabletting machine at
   the time of manufacturing, a deeper engraved stamp/cleavage line 95c (engraved
   stamp/cleavage line 95c in a case where it is formed only on one side) is formed in an
15 upper pestle.     In the present embodiment, since IC chip 4 is inserted into a die of the
   tabletting machine in a downward manner, the convex portion in IC chip 4 faces a side
   opposite to a tablet surface applied with a deeper engraved stamp /cleavage line.
            In first surface 95a, an engraved stamp or cleavage line 95c is formed.          In
   second surface 95b, an engraved stamp or cleavage line is not formed, or an engraved
20 stamp or cleavage line shallower than first surface 95a is formed.         Chip main body 6 is
   arranged in a medical tablet while facing the side of second surface 95b.           Therefore,
   IC chip 4 is equipped without a positional displacement.          Consequently, a breakage or
   crack due to the positional displacement of IC chip 4 (for example, exposure of IC chip
   4 to the side surface of tablet 95) can be prevented.
25          Further, it is preferable that a center of IC chip 4 in a thickness direction is
   located at a center of tablet 95 in a thickness direction.      Specifically, it is preferable
   that a center of IC chip 4 in the thickness direction is located at an intermediate position
   between first surface 95a and second surface 95b.
                                                 - 34 -

            <Modified Example>
            Push-in portion 64 is not always necessary.      Without providing push-in portion
   64, IC chip 4 may be pushed out with a pusher in a state where a lower surface of main
   body 62 is in contact with an upper surface of rotating plate 75.      In this case, the
 5 pharmaceutical powder within the die hole may be filled to an upper end of the die hole
   to be in a leveled state.   In this case, IC chip 4 is not pushed into pharmaceutical
   powder 90 but is placed on pharmaceutical powder 90.
            Moreover, in a case where push-in portion 64 is provided as in the above
   described embodiment, push-in portion 64 may enter die hole 78 and further push in the
10 pharmaceutical powder filled in die hole 78.        Accordingly, on the surface of the
   pharmaceutical powder, an inner shape recess matching with an outer shape of push-in
   portion 64 is formed.     Therefore, since IC chip 4 is set in the recess, the positional
   displacement due to the movement in the lateral direction can be suppressed assuredly.
            Even in the case where the protrusion is provided, the protrusion is not always
15 necessary to be formed to a lower end of positioning guide 61, and it may be omitted at
   the lower end.     In such a case, for example, the protrusion may be formed only in the
   main body portion, and it may be omitted at all of or a part of the portion corresponding
   to the push-in portion.
            It should be noted that, although positioning guide 61 including protrusion 67 in
20 the inner circumferential surface is provided, and the pusher is pushed out in the state
   where IC chip 4 is set in positioning guide 61 in the above-described embodiment, the
   present invention is not limited to this.    For example, a positioning guide without a
   protrusion may be used.      Moreover, suction means may be used in place of the pusher,
   so that the IC chip suctioned by suction means is supplied so as to be pushed into the
25 pharmaceutical powder within the die hole.
            Moreover, although the IC chip is supplied to the pharmaceutical powder in a
   downward manner in the above-described embodiment, the IC chip may be supplied in
   an upward manner.

           Fig. 21 is a front view representing a favorable one embodiment of a tablet
   manufacturing apparatus according to the present invention.      Figs. 22 and 23 are plan
   views thereof     Figs. 24A to 24C are drawings for explaining an IC chip to be supplied
   in the present embodiment.     The drawings subsequent to Figs. 24A to 24C are
 5 enlarged views of each part of the apparatus and for explaining an effect.
           As shown in Figs. 21 to 23, a tablet manufacturing apparatus according to the
   present embodiment includes a tabletting machine 1002, and a supply apparatus 1003
   for conveying and supplying an IC chip to tabletting machine 1002.       As shown in Figs.
   24A to 24C, an IC chip 1004 which is conveyed and supplied in the present
10 embodiment is in a form having a chip main body 1006 mounted at a center position of
   a circular base film 1005.    Base film 1005 has, for example, a disk-like outer shape
   with a diameter of 3.5 mm, and includes, for example, a function for supporting chip
   main body 6 and an antenna function for performing transmission of information with
   outside.   Chip main body 1006 has, for example, a rectangular outer shape of 1 mm
15 square, and an electronic circuit is incorporated therein.   Chip main body 1006
   includes, for example, a storage portion for storing information specifying a tablet to
   which IC chip 1004 is buried, and a function for transmitting information stored in the
   storage portion at a predetermined timing.
           As shown in Figs. 24A and 24B, IC chips 1004 having the above-described
20 configuration are accommodated in a belt-like accommodation tape 1007 in one line at
   predetermined intervals.     Accommodation tape 1007 includes a carrier tape 8 having
   accommodation recesses 1008a formed at predetermined intervals, and a top tape 1009
   covering an upper surface of carrier tape 1008.     IC chips 1004 are accommodated
   within accommodation recesses 1008a.        In Fig. 24B, as shown on the right side, top
25 tape 1009 is peeled from carrier tape 1008, so that the upper side of accommodation
   recesses 1008a are opened, so that accommodated IC chips 1004 can be taken out.          IC
   chip 1004 are accommodated in a state of being in an upward manner where chip main
   body 1006 is located in an upper part of accommodation recess 1008a.        Further,
                                              -36-

   accommodation tape 1007 has feed holes 1007a formed at equal pitch along one side
   edge.   This accommodation tape 1007 is taken up by a supply reel 1010.
           Supply apparatus 1003 includes a rotary support shaft 1011 which freely
   rotatably bearing-supports supply reel 1010 configured to take up on its front face the
 5 above-described accommodation tape 1007 in a rolled form, and supply reel 1010 is set
   on rotary support shaft 1011.     Supply apparatus 1003 includes various rollers which
   define on their front faces conveying passages for accommodation tape 1007 or
   separated carrier tape 1008 and top tape 1009, an accommodation tape opening portion
   1013 which allows top tape 1009 to be peeled off from carrier tape 1008 and allows IC
10 chip 1004 accommodated in accommodation tape 1007 to be taken out, a carrier tape
   collecting portion 1014 which collects carrier tape 1008 from which IC chip 1004 is
   taken out, and atop tape collecting portion 1015 which collects top tape 1009.
           Accommodation tape opening portion 1013 includes a guide plate 1017
   constituting a conveying path arranged at a predetermined position on an upper side in
15 a horizontal direction, a pair of sprockets 1018 arranged on front and back sides in the
   conveying direction of accommodation tape 1007 of guide plate 1017, and a peeling
   plate 1019 arranged at a predetermined position on an upper side of guide plate 1017.
           As shown in Figs. 25A to 25C by enlargement, guide plate 1017 is provided
   with a recessed groove 101 7a extending in an axial direction on an upper surface.    A
20 width of recessed groove 1017a is equal to or slightly larger than a tape width of
   accommodation tape 1007.       Accordingly, accommodation tape 1007 passes through
   recessed groove 101 7a, so that it moves forward stably without any lateral
   displacement.    Further, as shown in Figs. 25A to 25C and 26, in a section on an
   upstream side of guide plate 1017, a slit 1017b is provided in a bottom portion of
25 recessed groove 1017a, and slit 1017b communicates with a connection pipe 101 7c
   mounted to a lower surface of guide plate 1017.     Connection pipe 101 7c cooperates
   with an unillustrated suction pump.     Accordingly, a part of the bottom portion of
   recessed groove 1017a at which slit 1017b is opened generates a negative pressure, so
   that accommodation tape 1007 can be suctioned and conveyed stably.
                                              - 37 -

            Moreover, sprocket 1018 has protrusions 1018a       on its circumferential surface
   at a predetermined pitch.    When accommodation tape 1007 is passed over sprockets
   1018, protrusion 101 8a penetrates through feed holes 1007a of accommodation tape
   1007 and protrudes above tape 1007.        Accordingly, when sprockets 1018 are rotated,
 5 protrusions 101 8a within feed holes 1007a gives a conveying force to accommodation
   tape 1007, and accommodation tape 1007 follows it and moves forward by a
   predetermined amount, and the forward movement of accommodation tape 1004 is
   stopped when sprockets 1018 are stopped.         Sprockets 1018 cooperates with a drive
   motor such as a servo motor, which is not illustrated in the drawings, for which a
10 rotational angle can be controlled, and an intermittent driving is controlled at a
   predetermined timing.
            As schematically shown in Fig. 24B, peeling plate 1019 includes a reference
   surface 101 9a arranged in parallel with a conveying surface of accommodation tape
   1007, and a slope surface 1019b which slopes toward a diagonally backward direction
15 from reference surface 101 9a.     Accommodation tape 1007 passes through sprocket
   1018 on an upstream side and thereafter passes through a location between guide plate
   1017 and peeling plate 1019, and top tape 1009 is folded back from reference surface
   1019a to slope surface 1019b of peeling plate 1019 and peeled off from carrier tape
   1008.     Accordingly, carrier tape 1008 is opened on an upper side of accommodation
20 recess 1008a.     Then, carrier tape 1008 is guided by guide plate 1017 and moves
   horizontally.
            It should be noted that carrier tape 1008 passes through accommodation tape
   opening portion 1013 and thereafter passes through a predetermined passage to reach
   carrier tape collecting portion 1014, and then is taken up and collected by a take-up reel.
25 Similarly, peeled top tape 1009 also passes through a predetermined passage to reach
   top tape collecting portion 1015, and is taken up and collected by a take-up reel.
            Above accommodation tape opening portion 1013, an IC chip take-out
   apparatus 1020 is provided.      This IC chip take-out apparatus 1020 has a function of
   taking out an IC chip 1004 accommodated in opened accommodation tape 1007,
                                                -38-

   reversing an manner upside down, and passing IC chip 1004 to a conveying apparatus
   21 in the next stage.    In the present embodiment, two front and back IC chips 1004
   accommodated in accommodation tape 1007 are taken out collectively.         Accordingly,
   sprockets 1018 and the like are operated so as to intermittently convey accommodation
 5 tape 1007 at a pitch for two IC chips 1004, and is controlled to temporarily stop in a
   state where IC chips 1004 are located at a take-out position of IC chip take-out
   apparatus 1020.
            Then, IC chip take-out apparatus 1020 includes a first suction and hold member
   1022 for taking out IC chip 1004 accommodated in accommodation tape 1007 and
10 reversing IC chip 1004 upside down, and a second suction and hold member 1023 for
   receiving IC chip 1004 taken out and reversed by first suction and hold member 1022
   and supplying IC chip 1004 to conveying apparatus 1021.
            First suction and hold member 1022 is formed to have two first suction nozzle
   portions 1022b protruding at a leading end of an elongated belt-like main body 1022a.
15 An arrangement space of two first suction nozzle portions 1022b matches with an
   arrangement pitch of IC chips 1004 in accommodation tape 1007.        The leading end of
   first suction nozzle portion 1022b is opened, and the opened part communicates with a
   suction passage 1022c formed within main body 1022a and first suction nozzle portion
   1022b and is connected to an unillustrated suction pump.
20          Moreover, this first suction and hold member 1022 is configured to move
   upward and downward and rotate within a vertical plane.      As shown in Figs. 25A to
   25C by enlargement, this first suction and hold member 1022 is bearing- supported
   through bearing 1028 with respect to moving plate 1026 moving upward and
   downward and it moves upward and downward with moving plate 1026.            On a back
25 side of moving plate 1026, sliders 1024 are attached which are movable in upward and
   downward directions with respect to two guide rails 1025 extending upward and
   downward.       Moving plate 1026 is guided by guide rails 1025 and sliders 1024 and
   moves upward and downward stably.         A drive mechanism for allowing this moving
   plate 1026 upward and downward is configured to couple one end of belt-like coupling
                                              - 39 -

   plate 1031 to an eccentric position of rotating plate 1030 which receives a rotational
   force of drive motor 1033 to rotate, and couple the other end of coupling plate 1031 to
   moving plate 1026.     Accordingly, rotation of rotating plate 1030 moves coupling plate
   1031 and moving plate 1026 upward and downward.           Then, moving plate 1026
 5 reciprocates between a lifted position shown in Figs. 21 and 25A to 25C and a lowered
   position shown in Fig. 26.
           Moreover, on a back side of moving plate 1026, a drive motor 1032 is attached
   which is a drive source for rotating first suction and hold member 1022, and drive
   motor 1032 also moves upward and downward integrally with moving plate 1026.            A
10 rotational shaft 1034 cooperating with an output shaft of drive motor 1032 is mounted
   to bearing 1028 arranged so as to protrude on the front face side of moving plate 1026,
   and first suction and hold member 1022 is fixed to a leading end of rotational shaft
   1034.    Accordingly, rotation of drive motor 1032 also rotates first suction and hold
   member 1022.       Then, first suction and hold member 1022 temporarily stops rotation in
15 two manners: a passing manner in which the leading end faces upward as shown in Figs.
   21 and 25A to 25C; and a take-out manner in which the leading end faces downward as
   shown in Fig. 26.
           Accordingly, when drive motors 1032, 1033 are appropriately controlled to
   allow first suction and hold member 1022 to be moved downward in a downward take
20 out manner and positioned at a lowered positioned, a leading end of first suction nozzle
   portion 1022b comes into contact with IC chip 1004 within accommodation tape 1007
   (Figs. 26, 27A, and 28A).      When first suction nozzle portion 1022b communicates
   with an unillustrated suction pump in this state, suction by first suction nozzle portion
   1022b is performed, so that first suction nozzle portion 1022b suctions and holds IC
25 chip 1004.
           Next, when moving plate 1026 is moved upward while maintaining first suction
   and hold member 1022 to be in a downward take-out manner, first suction nozzle
   portion 1022b of first suction and hold member 1022 is positioned above
   accommodation tape 1007 in a state of suctioning and holding IC chip 1004.
                                               -40  -

   Accordingly, taking out IC chip 1004 from accommodation tape 1007 is completed.
   Then, moving plate 1026 and first suction and hold member 1022 are further moved
   upward to reach the lifted position.    Before reaching this lifted position, first suction
   and hold member 1022 receives driving of drive motor 1032, so that it is rotated by 180
 5 degrees and shifted to an upward passing manner.        Accordingly, IC chip 1004
   suctioned by first suction nozzle portion 1022b of first suction and hold member 1022
   is reversed upside down, so that chip main body 1006 takes a downward manner of
   being located on a lower side of base film 1005.
            As shown in Figs. 25A to 25C and 27B, a cylindrical guide (guide member)
10 1040 is arranged at a position where first suction nozzle portion 1022b of first suction
   and hold member 22 is located when first suction and hold member 1022 is at a lifted
   position in a passing manner of facing upward.       This cylindrical guide 1040 is coupled
   to a machine frame through a support plate 1048 extending in a horizontal direction and
   is fixedly arranged at a desired position.   Cylindrical guide 1040 includes two
15 through-holes 1041 extending upward and downward.            Two through-holes 1041 have
   parallel axis centers, and a pitch between the axes matches with an arrangement pitch
   of first suction nozzle portion 1022b.    Moreover, each through-hole 1041 includes an
   inlet region 1041 a at a lower end, a center region 104 1b, and an outlet region 104 1c at
   an upper end.     Inner shape dimensions of inlet region 1041a and outlet region 1041c
20 are set to be sufficiently greater than outer shape dimensions of IC chip 1004, and inner
   shape dimensions of center region 1041 b are set to be substantially equal to or greater
   than outer shape dimensions of IC chip 1004.       Further, the inner circumferential
   surface of center region 104 1b is set to be a tapered shape having a narrowest center in
   the up/down direction.     Then, when first suction and hold member 1022 moves
25 upward while maintaining a passing manner of facing upward, first suction nozzle
   portion 1022b enters inlet region 1041a from a lower end of cylindrical guide 1040, and
   a leading end of first suction nozzle portion 1022b is positioned within center region
   1041b when it reaches a lifted position.     More specifically, it is positioned near a
   narrowest center position within center region 1041 b.      Accordingly, entering of IC
                                               -41-

   chip 1004 suctioned and held by first suction nozzle portion 1022b into cylindrical
   guide 1040 passes through relatively large inlet region 1040a and moves within center
   region 1041 b having a gradually reduced inner diameter, so that it can move to the
   lifted position smoothly.
 5         On the other hand, second suction and hold member 1023 includes a first main
   body 1023a and second main body 1023b which come close to and separate from each
   other in a horizontal direction.   The leading ends of first and second main bodies
   1023a, , 1023b respectively include second suction nozzle portions 1023c.        An
   arrangement space of two second suction nozzle portions 1023c in a state where first
10 main body 1023a and second main body 1023b come close to each other is set to mach
   with an arrangement space of first suction nozzle portion 1022b of first suction and
   hold member 1022.      Further, the leading ends of second suction nozzle portions 1023c
   are opened, and the opened parts communicate with suction passages 1023d formed
   within first and second main bodies 1023a, 1023b and second suction nozzle portions
15 1023c and are connected to an unillustrated suction pump.
           Moreover, this second suction and hold member 1022 is configured to move
   within the three-dimensional space.     This movement is performed by a first robot
   1049.    In other words, first robot 1049 includes an arm 1044 of a SCARA robot
   moving within a horizontal plane, a support rod attached to a leading end lower surface
20 of arm 1044 so as to be movable in upward and downward directions, and a base 1042
   attached to the lower end of support rod 1043.     The horizontal movement of arm 1044
   of the SCARA robot and the upward and downward movement of support rod 1043
   allows base 1042 to be moved to a desired position within a three dimensional space.
   Then, first main body 1023a and second main body 1023b constituting second suction
25 and hold member 1023 are movably attached to guide rails 1042a provided at a lower
   surface of base 1042 through sliders 1023e.     The movement of first main body 1023a
   and second main body 1023b is performed by, for example, a cylinder driving.
   Accordingly, second suction and hold member 1023 supported by base 1042 and its
   lower surface move within the three dimensional space.       Further, first main body
                                               -42 -

   1023a and second main body 1023b come close to and separate from each other along
   guide rails 1042a.
            Specifically, second suction and hold member 1023 follows the operation of
   arm 1044 of the SCARA robot and moves to a position overlapping with cylindrical
 5 guide 1040 in the horizontal plane, and support rod 1043 is lowered while maintaining
   that state, so that second suction and hold member 1023 reaches a lowered position.
   At this time, first main body 1023a and second main body 1023b are set to come close
   to each other.    In this state, as shown in Figs. 25A to 25C, 27B, and 28B, second
   suction nozzle portions 1023c enter outlet region 1041 c from an upper end of
10 cylindrical guide 1040.      Then, after having reached a lowest end position, the leading
   ends of the second suction nozzles 1023c are positioned within center region 1041b.
   In this state, a control is performed to come close to a leading end of first suction
   nozzle portion 1022b of first suction and hold member 1022 located at the lifted
   position with a certain clearance (for example, 0.5 mm).
15          Accordingly, IC chip 1004 suctioned and held by first suction nozzle portion
   1022b waits in a state of being located in center region 104 1b of through-hole 1040 of
   cylindrical guide 1040, and lower ends of second suction nozzle portions 1023c of
   second suction and hold members 1023 having entered the cylindrical guide 1030 from
   above comes into contact with or close to IC chip 1004.        Then, suction by second
20 suction nozzle portion 1023c is started and suction by first suction nozzle portion
   1022b is stopped at an appropriate timing, so that suctioning and holding of IC chip
   1004 is shifted to the side of second suction and hold member 1023.
            As can be seen, the present embodiment is characterized in performing the
   transfer of IC chip 1004 from first suction and hold member 1022 to second suction and
25 hold member 1023 within cylindrical guide 1040.         Since IC chip 1004 has a small
   diameter of, for example, 3.5mm, and has a thin shape of base film 1005, it cannot be
   firmly held by a suction and hold member.        Therefore, if the passing from first suction
   and hold member 1022 to second suction and hold member 1023 is performed in a state
   where IC chip 1004 is exposed, IC chip 1004 is displaced when suction by first and
                                                -43-

   second suction nozzle portion 1022b, 1023b is switched.       Accordingly, the passing
   cannot be performed smoothly, and IC chip 1004 may be dropped.          However,
   according to the present embodiment, since the passing process is performed inside of
   cylindrical guide 1040, passing can be performed assuredly.
 5         After that, first suction and hold member 1022 moves downward while
   maintaining the passing manner.       When first suction nozzle portion 1022b goes out of
   cylindrical guide 1040, first suction and hold member 1022 rotates by 180 degrees and
   returns to a lowered position at an appropriate timing, and prepares for next operation
   of taking out the IC chip.     On the other hand, second suction and hold member 1023
10 having received IC chip 1004 moves upward along with lifting of support rod 1043,
   and second suction nozzle portion 1024 is located above cylindrical guide 1040.      After
   that, by the operation of arm 1044 of the SCARA robot, second suction and hold
   member 1023 moves in a horizontal direction and reaches a conveying-in position of
   conveying apparatus 1021.
15         As shown in Figs. 29A and 29B, conveying apparatus 1021 includes a first
   receiving portion 1045 and a second receiving portion 1046 for receiving two IC chips
   1004 suctioned, held, and conveyed by second suction and hold member 1023, and a
   drive mechanism 1047 for allowing these first receiving portion 1045 and second
   receiving portion 1046 to move forward and backward.         As shown in Figs. 30A and
20 30B by enlargement, first receiving portion 1045 includes recesses 1045b for
   accommodating IC chips 1004 in upper surfaces of two pillar portions 1045a facing
   upward and separated into two legs.      A space between pillar portions 1045a (recesses
   1045b) is in conformity with the tabletting machine in the next stage, and is set to be
   longer than an arrangement pitch of IC chips 1004 in accommodation tape 1007 (an
25 arrangement interval of first suction nozzle portion 1022b and second suction and hold
   member 1023).      Moreover, a bottom surface of recess 1045b communicates with a
   suction passage 1045c formed within pillar portion 1045a and is connected to an
   unillustrated suction pump.      Accordingly, IC chip 1004 set within recess 1045b is
   suctioned and held within recess 1045b.       Even when first receiving portion 1045
                                                -44 -

   moves forward, IC chip 1004 moves forward with first receiving portion 1045 while
   being set within recess 1045b.
            Similarly, second receiving portion 1046 includes recesses 1046b for
   accommodating IC chips 1004 on an upper surface of two pillar portions 1046a
 5 separated to be two legs facing upward.      A space of pillar portions 1046a (recesses
   1046b) is in conformity with the tabletting machine in the next stage and set to be
   longer than an arrangement pitch of IC chips 1004 in accommodation tape 1007 (an
   arrangement space of first suction nozzle portion 1022b and second suction and hold
   member 1023).       Moreover, the bottom surface of recess 1046b communicates with a
10 suction passage 1046c formed within pillar portion 1046a and is connected to an
   unillustrated suction pump.    Accordingly, IC chip 1004 set within recess 1046b is
   suctioned and held by recess 1046b.     Even when second receiving portion 1046 moves
   forward, IC chip 1004 moves forward with second receiving portion 1046 while being
   set within recess 1046b.
15         Drive mechanism 1047 for first receiving portion 1045 and second receiving
   portion 1046 includes a drive motor 1050, and a rack 1051 and a pinion 1052 which
   receive an output of drive motor 1050 and converts it into a reciprocating linear motion.
   First receiving portion 1045 and second receiving portion 1046 cooperate with rack
   1051 through respective coupling plates 1053, 1054 and move in reverse directions.
20 In other words, when first receiving portion 1045 moves forward, second receiving
   portion 1046 moves backward.       When first receiving portion 1045 moves forward,
   second receiving portion 1046 moves backward.        For example, when first receiving
   portion 1045 is at a conveying-in position, second receiving portion 1046 is at a
   conveying-out position.     Moreover, for example, when first receiving portion 1045 is
25 at a conveying-out position, second receiving portion 1046 is at a conveying-in position.
   Moreover, sliders 1055 are coupled to a lower surface of coupling plate 1053 and an
   upper surface of coupling plate 1054.     Sliders 1055 are mounted respectively to
   corresponding guide rails 1056, and guides forward and backward movement of rack
   1051 and each receiving portion 1045, 1046 with the rotation of pinion 1052.
                                              -45-

            Second suction and hold member 1023 having received IC chip 1004 moves
   within a horizontal plane by arm 1044 of the SCARA robot, and is positioned above
   first receiving portion 1045 or second receiving portion 1046 located at the conveying
   in position.   As described above, since first receiving portion 1045 and second
 5 receiving portion 1046 move forward and backward in directions opposite to each other,
   first robot 1049 controls an operation of arm 1044 of the SCARA robot, and allows
   second suction and hold member 1023 to be alternately positioned above the
   conveying-in position of first receiving portion 1045 and above the conveying-in
   position of second receiving portion 1046.
10          As described above, since a space between pillar portions 1045a (recesses
   1045b) of first receiving portion 1045 and a space between pillar portions 1046a
   (recesses 1046b) of second receiving portion 1046 are set to be wide, first robot 1049
   controls first main body 1023a and second main body 1023b of second suction and
   hold member 1023 to be separated apart to widen the space of second suction nozzle
15 portion 1023c during the horizontal movement of second suction and hold member
   1023 by arm 1044 of the SCARA robot or at the time of being positioned above the
   conveying-in position.     This widened space of second suction nozzle 1023c is set to be
   equal to the space of recesses 1045b, 1046b.
            Then, when support rod 1043 is moved downward in a state where first main
20 body 1023a and second main body 1023b are separated apart, for example, as shown in
   Fig. 30A, the lower end of second suction nozzle portion 1023c of second suction and
   hold member 1023 enters recess 1045b of first receiving portion 1045, so that IC chip
   1004 suctioned and held in a downward manner is set within recess 1045b.        The, when
   the suction on the side of second suction and hold member 1023 is released at an
25 appropriate timing, IC chip 1004 is transferred to recess 1045b of first receiving portion
   1045.     Moreover, first receiving portion 1045 starts the suction in advance or at an
   appropriate timing, and suctions and holds IC chip 1004 within recess 1045b.
            Second suction and hold member 1023 having completed a supply of IC chip
   1004 to first receiving portion 1045 in such a manner returns to a passing position
                                              -46  -

   within cylindrical guide 1040 by the operation of first robot 1049 and supplies a next
   passed IC chip to recess 1046b of second receiving portion 1046.
           On the other hand, first receiving portion1045 having received a supply of IC
   chip 1004 moves forward and is positioned at a conveying-out position.        IC chip 1004
 5 within recess 1045b of first receiving portion 1045 having reached the conveying-out
   position is suctioned and held by second robot 1070 and transferred to tabletting
   machine 1002.     Second robot 1070 includes an arm 1071 of the SCARA robot moving
   within the horizontal plane, a support member 1072 attached movably upward and
   downward on the leading end lower surface of arm 1071, and a pair of third suction
10 nozzle portion 1073 attached to a lower end of support member 1072.         A leading end
   of third suction nozzle portion 1073 is opened, and the opened part communicates with
   suction passage 1073a formed within third suction nozzle portion 1073 and is
   connected to an unillustrated suction pump.     Then, by the horizontal movement of arm
   1071 of the SCARA robot, and the upward and downward movement of support
15 member 1072, third suction nozzle portion 1073 can move to a desired position within
   the three dimensional space.    Further, a space of the pair of third suction nozzle
   portion 1073 matches with an arrangement space of pillar portions 1045a (recesses
   1045b) of first receiving portion 1045 and pillar portions 1046a (recesses 1046b) of
   second receiving portion 1046.
20         Therefore, the suction by means of the suction pump is performed in a state
   where a lower end of third suction nozzle portion 1073 reaches recess 1045b of first
   receiving portion 1045 or recess 1046b of second receiving portion at the conveying
   out position by the operation of second robot 1070.     When the suction by the vacuum
   pump on the side of first receiving portion 1045 or second receiving portion 1046 is
25 released, IC chip 1004 is suctioned and held on the side of third suction nozzle portion
   1073 (refer to Fig. 30B).
           Next, by the operation of second robot 1070, third suction nozzle portion 1073
   suctioning and holding IC chip 1004 performs the upward movement, the horizontal
   movement, and the descending movement, so that, as shown in Figs. 22 and 31 B, it is
                                              -47-

   positioned within IC chip receiving portion 1079 of rotary table 1075 of IC chip supply
   apparatus 1074 arranged on the conveying-in side of tabletting machine 1002.         When
   the suction by third suction nozzle portion 1073 is released in this state, IC chip 1004 is
   supplied into IC chip receiving portion 1079.
 5         Tabletting machine 1002 includes IC chip supply apparatus 1074 and tabletting
   machine main body 1076 described above.          Tabletting machine main body 1076 is
   similar to the conventionally existing tabletting machine, and it fills pharmaceutical
   powder into a plurality of die holes 1078 provided at predetermined intervals on a
   circumference along the outer edge portion of rotating plate 1077 and compresses and
10 shapes the filled pharmaceutical powder by means of a lower pestle and an upper pestle
   to manufacture a tablet.    In the present embodiment, in order to manufacture an IC
   chip-containing tablet, a function of firstly supplying IC chip 1004 by means of IC chip
   supply apparatus 1074 onto a predetermined amount pharmaceutical powder supplied
   to die hole 1078, further filling pharmaceutical powder onto IC chip 1004, and
15 thereafter compressing and shaping these pharmaceutical powder and IC chip from
   above and below.     Details of the manufacturing processes for tablets will be described
   later.
           IC chip supply apparatus 1074 as a main part of the present invention includes
   rotary table 1075 described above, and aligns and supplies IC chip 1004 supplied to
20 rotary table 1075 within die hole 1078 of tabletting machine main body 1076.         Rotary
   table 1075 is rotated by a rotational force received from drive motor 1060.      In the
   present embodiment, it is controlled to rotate intermittently at 90 degrees intervals.
   Moreover, rotary table 1075 includes protruding parts 1075b protruding outward at 90
   degrees intervals on an outer circumference of plate-like main body 1075a.        IC chip
25 receiving portion 1079 is provided at protruding parts 1075b.     From the side of supply
   apparatus 1003, IC chips 1004 are supplied in two-pieces unit.      Therefore, two IC chip
   receiving portions 1079 are provided for each protruding part 1075b.       In the present
   embodiment, a position rotated by 180 degrees from the IC chip receiving position
   from supply apparatus 1003 on an upstream side is set to be a supplying position of IC
                                               -48-

   chip 1004 to tabletting machine main body 1076.      Then, it is temporarily stopped at a
   position rotated by 90 degrees from the IC chip receiving position.     At this time, it is
   favorable to provide, for example, an inspection apparatus for performing an inspection
   on whether or not the IC ship is correctly supplied to IC chip receiving portion 1059.
 5         As shown in Fig. 32 by enlargement, a through-hole 1075b' penetrating up and
   down is provided at a specified position of protruding part 1075 of rotary table 1075,
   and a positioning guide 1061 is mounted to through-hole 1075b'.       This positioning
   guide 1061 constitutes IC chip receiving portion 1059.     Positioning guide 1061 has a
   basic shape of a ring shape having a through hole penetrating up and down as also
10 shown in Figs. 33A to 33C.
           Positioning guide 1061 includes a flange portion radially protruding on an outer
   circumference of an upper circumferential side surface of a cylindrical main body 1062,
   and a convex portion 1063 protruding upward is provided at a center of an upper
   surface of main body 1062.     Convex portion 1063 includes a flat surface 1063a on its
15 side surface.   Convex portion 1063 is inserted to through-hole 1075b' of protruding
   part 1075b, and flange portion 1063 is sandwiched and held by protruding part 1075b
   and main body 1075a.      Accordingly, a movement in an axial direction, in other words,
   an up/down direction of positioning guide 1061 is prevented, so that separation of
   positioning guide 1061 from rotary table 1075 is prevented.      Further, an inner
20 circumferential surface shape of through-hole 1075b' of protruding part 1075b is set to
   substantially match with an outer peripheral surface shape of convex portion 1063 of
   positioning guide 1061.     Accordingly, rotation about an axis of positioning guide 1061
   is prevented.   Therefore, positioning guide 1061 is held at rotary table 1075 at a
   correct location and in a correct manner.
25         A through-hole 1066 provided in positioning guide 1061 has a tapered surface
   1066a in which a cross section of an upper region is circular and has a diameter
   gradually increasing as it goes upward.    This upper region is a region in which convex
   portion 1063 is mainly formed.     An inner diameter of through-hole 1066 at an upper
   end of convex portion 1063 is set to be larger than an outer diameter of IC chip 1004,
                                              -49-

   and IC chip 1004 suctioned and held by third suction nozzle portion 1073 enters
   through-hole 1066 of positioning guide 1061 in accordance with the lowering of third
   suction nozzle portion 1073.       The entering is guided by tapered surface 1066a to
   prompt a smooth downward movement.
 5          Moreover, an inner circumferential surface in a portion of main body 1062 of
   through-hole 1066 is provided with a plurality of protrusions 1067 protruding toward a
   center.    In the present embodiment, five protrusions 1067 are provided.      However,
   the number may be, for example, three, or any other number may be used.          A leading
   end position of protrusion 1067 is positioned on an imaginary circumference being
10 concentric with through-hole 1066 and having a predetermined diameter.          This
   predetermined diameter is set to be equal to or slightly smaller than a diameter of IC
   chip 1004.     Accordingly, a peripheral edge of IC chip 1004 inserted to through-hole
   1066 of positioning guide 1061 is supported by protrusions 1067, and IC chip 1004 is
   held in a state where a center of IC chip 1004 and a center of positioning guide 1061
15 (through-hole 1066) are matched.        Therefore, positioning is performed with a high
   accuracy.     Moreover, it is preferable to manufacture positioning guide 1061 with an
   elastic body such as rubber since it holds IC chip 1004 more firmly.       Furthermore,
   protrusions 1067 are preferably arranged at equal intervals in the circumferential
   direction.    It is preferable since IC chip 1004 is evenly supported.
20          Further, in the present embodiment, a push-in portion 1064 protruding
   downward is provided on a lower surface of main body 1062.           A planar shape of this
   push-in portion 1064 is set to be substantially elliptical as shown in Fig. 33C.     In this
   example, it has a shape of being collapsed flatly on both ends of a large-diameter side
   of the elliptical shape.    The planar shape of push-in portion 1064 is based on a shape
25 of a tablet to be manufactured, and is slightly smaller than that shape.    In other words,
   it has a shape which is slightly smaller than a cross-sectional shape of die hole 1078
   formed in tabletting machine main body 1076.         Moreover, push-in portion 1064 has a
   tapered shape 1064a having a peripheral surface becoming smaller as it goes downward.
   Further, in the present embodiment, protrusions 1067 formed on an inner
                                                - 50 -

   circumferential surface of through-hole 1066 is formed to a lower end of this push-in
   portion 1064.
            Next, a supply of IC chip 1004 from supply apparatus 1003 to IC chip supply
   apparatus 1074 and an operation of supplying IC chip 1004 to tabletting machine 1002
 5 will be described, and a configuration of IC chip supply apparatus 1074 will be
   described.    Figs. 34A and 35A represents a state in which a leading end of third
   suction nozzle portion 1073 of supply apparatus 1003 is inserted into positioning guide
   1061 constituting IC chip receiving portion 1059.      As shown in the drawings, second
   suction and hold member 1023 moves downward, and a leading end of third suction
10 nozzle portion 1073 suctioning and holding IC chip 1004 enters through-hole 1066 of
   positioning guide 1061, and stops at an appropriate position of main body 1062.       At
   this appropriate position, IC chip 1004 is supported by protrusions 1067.     Since the
   suction by third suction nozzle portion 1073 is performed until reaching this stopping
   position, IC chip 1004 moves downward while maintaining a horizontal state in a
15 downward manner in which chip main body 1006 is positioned below.           At the lower
   stopping position of third suction nozzle portion 1073, IC chip 1004 comes into contact
   with the plurality of protrusions 1067 in a horizontal manner.
            Next, the suction by third suction nozzle portion 1073 is released, and third
   suction nozzle portion 1073 moves upward, separates apart from positioning guide
20 1061, and proceeds to take next IC chip.      On the other hand, IC chip 1004 in a
   downward manner remaining in positioning guide 1061 is supported in a state of
   maintaining a horizontal manner by protrusions 1067 of positioning guide 1061.
   Moreover, the above-described positioning of IC chip 1004 at a center is performed
   with a high accuracy.
25          The drawings subsequent to Figs. 34B and 35B represent a supply position to
   tabletting machine 1002 with rotary table 1075 rotated by 180 degrees from the state of
   Figs. 34A and 35A.      At this supply position, two pushers 1082 are suspended on the
   leading end lower surface of an L-shaped plate 1081 which receives driving of first
   cylinder 1080 and moves upward and downward.          Two pushers 1082 are in
                                               -51 -

   conformity with an arrangement pitch of two positioning guides 1061 adjacent to each
   other in a circumferential direction, and are adjusted so that an axis center of each
   positioning guide 1061 and an axis center of pusher 1082 matches at the time when the
   rotary table is temporarily stopped.
 5           Further, first cylinder 1080, L-shaped plate 1081, pushers 1082, and rotary table
   1075 can be lifted and lowered integrally.       Then, the lifting and lowering operation is
   performed by receiving driving of second cylinder 1083.
             Therefore, positions of rotary table 1075 and pushers 1082 can be switched by
   appropriately switching the reciprocating operation of first cylinder 1080 and second
10 cylinder 1083.      For example, Figs. 34B and 35B represent a state in which first
   cylinder 1080, L-shaped plate 1081, pushers 1082, and rotary table 1075 are positioned
   at a lifted position by second cylinder 1083, and pushers 1082 are also positioned at a
   lifted position by first cylinder 1080.     In this state, rotary table 1075 is separated apart
   from an upper surface of rotating table 1077 of tabletting machine main body 1076, and
15 positioning guide 1061 is also separated apart from an upper surface of rotating plate
   1077.     Moreover, a lower surface of pusher 1082 is positioned above positioning
   guide 1061, and pushers 1082 and IC chip 1004 supported by positioning guide 1061 in
   a downward manner are in a non-contact state.          This state is an initial state when
   rotary table 1075 is rotated to reach a supplying position and temporarily stopped.
20           Next, only second cylinder 1083 is operated to position first cylinder 1080, L
   shaped plate 1081, pushers 1082, and rotary table 1075 at a lowered position.
   Accordingly, as shown in Figs. 34C and 35C, rotary table 1075 comes close to an upper
   surface of rotating plate 1077 of tabletting machine main body 1076, and a lower
   surface of main body 1062 of positioning guide 1061 comes into contact with an upper
25 surface of rotating plate 1077.      Further, push-in portion 1064 enters die hole 1078, and
   comes into contact with pharmaceutical powder filled in die hole 1078.             Moreover, at
   this time, since first cylinder 1080 remains in the initial state, a relative positional
   relationship between pusher 1082 and positioning guide 1061 does not change, and a
   lower surface of pusher 1082 is positioned above positioning guide 1061, and pushers
                                                 - 52  -

   1082 and IC chip 1004 in a downward manner supported by positioning guide 1061 are
   in a non-contact state.
           After that, while second cylinder 1083 maintains the above-described state, first
   cylinder 1080 is operated, and pushers 1082 are moved downward.          Accordingly, as
 5 shown in Figs. 34D and 3 5D, a lower end of pusher 1082 reaches a lower end of
   positioning guide 1061, in other words, to a lower end of push-in portion 1064, and IC
   chip 1004 is forced downward by pusher 1082, pushed out from positioning guide 1061,
   and pushed into pharmaceutical powder 1090.        Also during the downward movement
   of IC chip 1004 by pusher 1082, IC chip 1004 moves while maintaining a horizontal
10 state and a center position by means of protrusions 1067 of positioning guide 1061.
   Therefore, when IC chip 1004 is pushed out from positioning guide 1061 and finally
   pushed into and supplied to pharmaceutical powder 1090, it is supplied with a high
   accuracy to a center of a surface of pharmaceutical powder 1090 filled in die hole 1078.
   Moreover, since IC chip 1004 is pushed by pusher 1082 into pharmaceutical powder
15 1090 before being compressed by tabletting machine main body, a positional
   displacement is suppressed.
           Further, since IC chip 1004 is pushed into pharmaceutical powder 1090 in a
   downward manner in which chip main body 1006 is positioned below, chip main body
   1006 is further inserted into pharmaceutical powder 1090 with respect to a surface of
20 pharmaceutical powder 1090 in contact with base film 1005 for example.         Therefore,
   even when IC chip 1004 attempts to move in a horizontal direction, chip main body
   1006 serves like a wedge, so that a positional displacement due to a lateral movement
   can be suppressed assuredly.
           Further, in the present embodiment, as described above, a horizontal state and a
25 positioning at a center is performed with a high accuracy by protrusions 1067 of
   positioning guide 1061.     Thus, since it can be supplied to a center of pharmaceutical
   powder 1090 assuredly, positioning is secured without performing, after the supply, an
   inspection on whether or not it is supplied to a correct position.   Therefore, even in the
   case where an inspection apparatus is provided, it may be a simple sensor for
                                               - 53 -

   confirming presence of a supply, and an apparatus for which a space region for
   installation cannot be secured may be used.
            Figs. 36A to 39C represent an operation of tabletting machine main body 1005.
   As shown in Fig. 36A, a lower pestle 1092 is fitted to a lower side of die hole 1078
 5 from a lower side slidably upward and downward.         As shown in Fig. 39A, an upper
   pestle 1093 is provided on an upper side of die hole 1078 movably upward and
   downward.       As shown in Fig. 36A, firstly, pharmaceutical powder 1090 is filled into
   die hole 1078 by pharmaceutical powder filling apparatus in a state where lower pestle
   1092 is at a lowered position within die hole 1078.     Next, lower pestle 1092 is lifted,
10 and a supply by pharmaceutical powder filling apparatus 1094 is cut, and a certain
   amount of pharmaceutical powder 1090 is filled into a space of die hole 1078 formed
   on an upper side of lower pestle 1092 in a leveled state (Fig. 36B).     After that, lower
   pestle 1092 is lowered by a predetermined amount, so that a surface of pharmaceutical
   powder 1090 is slightly lowered from an upper surface of rotating plate 1075 (Fig.
15 37A).
            In this state, by means of IC chip supply apparatus 1074 described above,
   positioning guide 1061 having IC chip 1004 in a downward manner set therein enters
   die hole 1078 (Fig. 37B), and IC chip 1004 is pushed out and pushed into
   pharmaceutical powder 1090 by pusher 1082 (Fig. 37C).
20          Next, rotating plate 1075 rotates to allow the die hole positioned at the supply
   position to proceed to the next step (Fig. 3 8A).   In a state where lower pestle 1092 is
   lowered within die hole 1078, pharmaceutical powder 1090 is filled in die hole 1078 by
   pharmaceutical powder filling apparatus 1094 (Fig. 38B).        Next, lower pestle 1092 is
   lifted, and a supply by pharmaceutical powder filling apparatus 1094 is cut, and a space
25 of die hole 1078 formed on an upper side of lower pestle 1092 is filled with a certain
   amount of pharmaceutical powder 1090 in a leveled state (Fig. 38C).
            Next, upper pestle 1093 moves downward and compresses pharmaceutical
   powder 1090 between upper pestle1093 and lower pestle 1092 (Fig. 39A).
   Accordingly, pharmaceutical powder 1090 is solidified, so that an IC chip-containing
                                               - 54 -

   tablet 1095 is manufactured (Fig. 39B).       After that, lower pestle 1092 further moves
   upward to discharge manufactured tablet 1095.
            <Modified Example>
            Push-in portion 1064 is not always necessary.       Without providing push-in
 5 portion 1064, IC chip 1004 may be pushed with a pusher in a state where a lower
   surface of main body 1062 is in contact with an upper surface of rotating plate 1075.
   In this case, pharmaceutical powder within the die hole may be filled to an upper end of
   the die hole to be a leveled state.
            Moreover, when push-in portion 1064 is provided as in the above-described
10 embodiment, push-in portion 1064 may enter die hole 1078 and further push the
   pharmaceutical powder filled in die hole 1078.        Accordingly, a recess having an inner
   shape matching with an outer shape of push-in portion 1064 is formed on a surface of
   pharmaceutical powder.       Therefore, since IC ship 1004 is set within the recess, the
   positional displacement due to the lateral movement can be suppressed assuredly.
15          Even in the case where protrusions are provided, it may be omitted at a lower
   end rather than forming it to a lower end of positioning guide 1061.       In such a case,
   for example, protrusions may be formed only at the main body portion, and protrusions
   may be omitted at whole or a part of the portion corresponding to the push-in portion.
            It should be noted that, in the above-described embodiment, although
20 positioning guide 1061 including protrusions 1067 on the inner circumferential surface
   is provided, and IC chip 1004 set within positioning guide 1061 is pushed by the pusher,
   the present invention is not limited to this.    For example, a positioning guide without
   protrusions may be used.      Moreover, suction means may be used in place of the
   pusher to push an IC chip suction by the suction means into the pharmaceutical powder
25 within the die hole.
            Moreover, although the IC chip is supplied to the pharmaceutical powder in a
   downward manner in the above-described embodiment, it may be supplied in an
   upward manner.
                                               -  55 -

            Although IC chip 1004 is accommodated in accommodation tape 1007, and first
   suction and hold member 1022 takes out the IC chip from the accommodation tape in
   the above-described embodiment, the present invention is not limited to this.      For
   example, IC chips 1004 may be aligned by, for example, a parts feeder or the like.
 5          <Modified Example of Guide Member>
            In the above-described embodiment, an example is described in which a fixed
   cylindrical guide 1040 is used as an item constituting a guide member.       However, the
   present invention is not limited to this.  For example, it may include a plurality of
   moving guide members, and a drive mechanism for allowing the moving guide member
10 to come close to and separate from each other, and the plurality of moving guide
   members may come close to each other to form a through-hole.         For example, as
   shown in Figs. 40A and 40B, guide member 1098 is configured to allow two moving
   guide member 1096 to cooperate with cylinders 1097 as respective drive sources and
   come close to and separate from each other.
15          Moreover, at a leading end of moving guide member 1096, flat parts 1096a on
   both sides and recesses 1096b near a center are formed.      As shown in Fig. 40A, in a
   state where two moving guide members 1096 receive a driving force of cylinder 1097
   and are separated apart, a space between leading ends is widened.      First suction nozzle
   portion 1022b of first suction and hold member 1022 enters the space.       Next, when
20 moving guide members 1096 are moved to come close to each other, flat parts 1096a
   come into contact with each other, and a through-hole is formed between recesses
   1096b.     First suction nozzle portion 1022b is controlled so as to be positioned within
   the through-hole.     Moreover, the second suction nozzle portion is also positioned
   within this through-hole at an appropriate timing and holds IC chip 1004 suctioned and
25 held by first suction nozzle portion 1022b.
            Then, even in the case where a center of IC chip 1004 is displaced from a center
   of first suction nozzle portion 1022b when first suction member 1022 takes out IC chip
   1004 from accommodation tape 1007, if moving guide member 1096 is moved com
   close in a state where first suction and hold member 1022 (first suction nozzle portion
                                              -56-

   1022b) is positioned between moving guide member 1096 at a position of receiving IC
   chip 1004, recess 1096b come into contact with a side surface of IC chip 1004, so that
   IC chip 1004 is moved in the horizontal direction to a center of first suction nozzle
   portion 1022b, so that positioning can be performed.       It should be noted that inner
 5 shape dimensions of the through-hole formed by moving guide member 1096 coming
   close are greater than the outer shape dimensions of IC chip 1004, and IC chip 1004 is
   not sandwiched and gripped within recessed groove 1096b when both moving guide
   members 1096 come close to each other, and a smooth transfer from first suction
   nozzle portion 1022b to second suction nozzle portion 1023c is performed.
10          Further, moving guide members 1096 may be moved to come close to each
   other after first suction nozzle portion 1022b and second suction nozzle portion 1023b
   face and come close to each other.      In this manner, the IC chip can be passed
   assuredly in a state of being surrounded by the first nozzle portion, the second nozzle
   portion, and the moving guide surface.
15          Fig. 41 is a front view representing a favorable one embodiment of a tablet
   manufacturing apparatus according to the present invention.        Figs. 42 and 43 are plan
   views thereof      Figs. 44A to 44C are diagrams for explaining an IC chip to be supplied
   in the present embodiment.      Figs. 44A to 44C and subsequent drawings are enlarged
   views of each portion of an apparatus and an effect thereof
20          As shown in Figs. 41 to 43, a tablet manufacturing apparatus of the present
   embodiment includes a tabletting machine 2002 and a supply apparatus 2003 for
   conveying and supplying an IC chip to tabletting machine 2002.         IC chip 2004
   conveyed and supplied in the present embodiment has a formed in which a chip main
   body 2006 is mounted at a center position of a circular base film 2005 as shown in Figs.
25 44A to 44C.      Base film 2005 has a disk-like outer diameter having a diameter of, for
   example, 3.5 mm, and has, for example, a function of supporting chip main body 2006
   and an antenna function of communicating information with outside.          Chip main body
   2006 has a rectangular outer shape of, for example, 1 mm square, and an electronic
   circuit is incorporated inside.    Chip main body 2006 includes, for example, a storage
                                                - 57 -

   portion storing information for specifying a tablet into which IC chip 2004 is buried,
   and a function for transmitting the information stored in the storage portion at a
   predetermined timing.
            IC chip 2004s having the above-described configuration, as shown in Figs. 44A
 5 and 44B, are accommodated in line at predetermined intervals in a belt-like
   accommodation tape 2007.       Accommodation tape 2007 includes a carrier tape 2008
   having accommodation recesses 2008a formed at predetermined intervals, and a top
   tape 2009 covering an upper surface of carrier tape 2008.      IC chip 2004 is
   accommodated in accommodation recess 2008a.           In Fig. 44B, as illustrated on the
10 right side, top tape 2009 is peeled off from carrier tape 2008 to open an upper side of
   accommodation recess 2008a, so that accommodated IC chip 2004 can be taken out.
   IC chip 2004 is accommodated in accommodation recess 2008a in a state of being in an
   upward manner where chip main body 2006 is positioned on an upper side.            Further,
   accommodation tape 2007 has feed holes 2007a formed at even pitches along one side
15 edge.    This accommodation tape 2007 is taken up by a supply reel 2010.
            Supply apparatus 2003 includes, on it front face, a rotary support shaft 2011
   freely rotatably bearing-supporting supply reel 2010 configured to take up the above
   described accommodation tape 2007 in a rolled form, and supply reel 2010 is set on
   rotary support shaft 2011.    Supply apparatus 2003 includes, on its front face,     various
20 rollers 2012 for defining conveying routes of accommodation tape 2007 and separated
   carrier tape 2008 and top tape 2009, accommodation tape opening portion 2013 peeling
   off top tape 2009 from carrier tape 2008 to enable taking out IC chip 2004
   accommodated in accommodation tape 2007, a carrier tape collecting portion 2014 for
   collecting carrier tape 2008 after IC chip 2004 is taken out, and a top tape collecting
25 portion 2015 for collecting top tape 2009.
            Accommodation tape opening portion 2013 includes a guide plate 2017
   constituting a conveying passage arranged in a horizontal direction on an upper
   predetermined position, a pair of sprockets 2018 arranged on a front side and back side
                                              -58-

   in a conveying direction of accommodation tape 2007 of guide plate 2017, and a
   peeling plate 2019 arranged on an upper predetermined position of guide plate 2017.
            Guide plate 2017, as shown in Figs. 45A to 45C by enlargement, has a recessed
   groove 2017a extending in an axial direction on an upper surface.       A width of
 5 recessed groove 2017a is set to be equal to or slightly larger than a tape width of
   accommodation tape 2007.       Therefore, accommodation tape 2007 passes within
   recessed groove 2017a to move forward stably without a positional displacement.
   Further, as shown in Figs. 45A to 45C and Fig. 46, in a portion on an upstream side of
   guide plate 2017, a slit 2017b is formed on a bottom portion of recessed groove 2017a,
10 and slit 2017b communicates with a connection pipe 2017c mounted to a lower surface
   of guide plate 2017.    Connection pipe 2017c cooperates with an unillustrated suction
   pump.     Accordingly, a part having an opened slit 2017b on a bottom surface of
   recessed groove 2017a generates a negative pressure to suction accommodation tape
   2007, so that a stable conveyance can be performed.
15          Moreover, sprockets 2018 have protrusions 2018a on its circumferential surface
   at predetermined pitches.    When accommodation tape 2007 is passed on sprocket
   2018, protrusions 2018a penetrate through feed holes 2007a of accommodation tape
   2007 to protrude upward from accommodation tape 2007.           Accordingly, when
   sprockets 2018 are rotated, protrusions 2018a within feed holes 2007a give a conveying
20 force to accommodation tape 2007, so that accommodation tape 2007 follows it and
   moves forward by a predetermined quantity.        When sprockets 2018 are stopped, the
   forward movement of accommodation tape 2007 is also stopped.           Sprocket   2018
   cooperates with an unillustrated drive motor such as a servo motor capable of
   controlling a rotational angle, and an intermittent operation is controlled at a
25 predetermined timing.
            Peeling plate 2019, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 44B, includes a reference
   surface 2019a arranged in parallel with a conveyance surface of accommodation tape
   2007, and a slope surface 2019b sloped diagonally backward from reference surface
   2019a.    Accommodation tape 2007 passes through sprocket 2018 on an upstream side

   and thereafter passes through a position between guide plate 2017 and peeling plate
   2019, and top tape 2009 is folded back by slope surface 2019b from reference surface
   2019a of peeling plate 2019 and peeled off from carrier tape 2008.      Accordingly,
   carrier tape 2008 is opened on an upper side of accommodation recess 2008a.        Then,
 5 carrier tape 2008 is guided by guide plate 2017 and moves horizontally.
            It should be noted that carrier tape 2008 passes through accommodation tape
   opening portion 2013 and thereafter passes through a predetermined passage to reach
   carrier tape collecting portion 2014 and is taken up and collected by a take-up reel.
   Similarly, peeled top tape 2009 also passes through a predetermined passage to reach
10 top tape collecting portion 2015, and is taken up and collected by a take-up real and
   collected.
            On an upper side of accommodation tape opening portion 2013, a IC chip take
   out apparatus 2020 is provided.      This IC chip take-out apparatus 2020 has a function
   of taking out IC chip 2004 accommodated within opened accommodation tape 2007,
15 reversing an manner upside down, and passing IC chip 2004 to conveying apparatus
   2021 in a next stage.    In the present embodiment, two front and back IC chips 2004
   accommodated in accommodation tape 2007 are taken out collectively.         Therefore,
   sprockets 2018 and the like are operated to intermittently convey accommodation tape
   2007 at intervals of two IC chips 2004 and controlled to temporarily stopped in a state
20 where IC chip 2004 is positioned at a take-out position of IC chip take-out apparatus
   2020.
            Then, IC chip take-out apparatus 2020 includes a first suction and hold member
   2022 for taking out IC chip 2004 accommodated in accommodation tape 2007 and
   reversing IC chip 2004 upside down, and a second suction and hold member 2023 for
25 receiving IC chip 2004 taken out and reversed by first suction and hold member 2022
   and supplying IC chip 2004 to conveying apparatus 2021.
            First suction and hold member 2022 has two first suction nozzle portions 2022b
   formed to protrude on a leading end of main body 2022a having an elongated belt-like
   shape.     An arrangement interval of two first suction nozzle portion 2022b matches
                                                - 60 -

   with an arrangement pitch of IC chip 2004 in accommodation tape 2007.          A leading
   end of first suction nozzle portion 2022b is opened, and the opening part communicates
   with a suction passage 2022c formed within main body 2022a and first suction nozzle
   portion 2022b and is connected to an unillustrated suction pump.
 5          Moreover, this first suction and hold member 2022 is configured to move
   upward and downward and be rotated within a vertical plane.        As illustrated in Figs.
   45A to 45C by enlargement, first suction and hold member 2022 is bearing-supported
   through bearing 2028 with respect to moving plate 2026 moving upward and
   downward, and moves upward and downward with moving plate 2026.               On a back
10 side of moving plate 2026, sliders 2024 are attached which are mounted to be moved
   upward and downward with respect to two guide rails 2025 extending upward and
   downward.      Moving plate 2026 stably moves upward and downward while being
   guided by guide rails 2025 and sliders 2024.      A drive mechanism for moving this
   moving plate 2026 upward and downward is configured to couple one end of belt-like
15 coupling plate 2031 to an eccentric position of rotating plate 2030 which is rotated by a
   rotational force received from drive motor 2033 and couple the other end of coupling
   plate 2031 to moving plate 2026.      Accordingly, rotation of rotating plate 2030 causes
   coupling plate 2031 and moving plate 2026 to move upward and downward.             Then,
   moving plate 2026 reciprocates between a lifted position shown in Figs. 41 and 45A to
20 45C and a lowered position shown in Fig. 46.
            Moreover, on a back side of moving plate 2026, a drive motor 2032 is attached
   which is a drive source for rotating first suction and hold member 2022, and drive
   motor 2032 also moves upward and downward integrally with moving plate 2026.
   Rotational shaft 2034 cooperating with an output shaft of drive motor 2032 is mounted
25 to a bearing 2028 arranged to protrude on a front face side of moving plate 2026, and
   first suction and hold member 2022 is fixed to a leading end of rotational shaft 2034.
   Accordingly, rotation of drive motor 2032 causes first suction and hold member 2022
   to rotate.   Then, first suction and hold member 2022 temporarily stops its rotation in
   two manners of a passing manner having a leading end facing upward as shown in Figs.
                                               -61 -

   41 and 45A to 45C and a take-out manner having a leading end facing downward as
   shown in Fig. 46.
            Accordingly, when drive motors 2032, 2033 are appropriately controlled to
   move first suction and hold member 2022 downward in a state of being in a take-out
 5 manner of facing downward, a leading end of first suction nozzle portion 2022b comes
   into contact with IC chip 2004 within accommodation tape 2007 (Figs. 46, 47A, and
   48A).    When first suction nozzle portion 2022b communicates with an unillustrated
   suction pump in this state, suction by first suction nozzle portion 2022b is performed,
   so that first suction nozzle portion 2022b suctions and holds IC chip 2004.
10          Next, when moving plate 2026 is moved upward while maintaining first suction
   and hold member 2022 to be in the downward take-out manner, first suction nozzle
   portion 2022b of first suction and hold member 2022 is positioned above
   accommodation tape 2007 in a state of suctioning and holding IC chip 2004.
   Accordingly, taking out IC chip 2004 from accommodation tape 2007 is completed.
15 Then, moving plate 2026 and first suction and hold member 2022 further moves
   upward to reach a lifted position.    Before reaching the lifted position, first suction and
   hold member 2022 receives driving of drive motor 2032 and rotates by 180 degrees to
   shift to a passing manner of facing upward.      Accordingly, IC chip 2004 suctioned by
   first suction nozzle portion 2022b of first suction and hold member 2022 is reversed
20 upside down to be at a flat position in which chip main body 2006 is positioned on a
   lower side of base film 2005.
            As shown in Figs. 45A to 45C and 47B, a cylindrical guide 2040 is arranged at
   a position where first suction nozzle portion 2022b of first suction and hold member
   2022 when first suction and hold member 2022 is at a lifted position in a passing
25 manner of facing upward.      This cylindrical guide 2040 is coupled to a machine frame
   through a support plate 2048 and the like extending in a horizontal direction and
   fixedly arranged at a desired position.   Cylindrical guide 2040 includes two through
   holes 2041 extending upward and downward.          Two through-holes 2041 have parallel
   axes, and a pitch between axes is matched with an arrangement pitch of first suction
                                               - 62 -

   nozzle portion 2022b.    Moreover, each through-hole 2041 includes a inlet region
   2041a at a lower end, a center region 2041 b, and an outlet region 2041c at an upper end.
   Inner diameter dimensions of inlet region 2041a and outlet region 204 1c are set to be
   enough larger than outer shape dimensions of IC chip 2004, and inner shape
 5 dimensions of center region 204 lb are set to be substantially equal to or greater than
   outer shape dimensions of IC chip 2004.       Further, the inner circumferential surface of
   center region 2041 b is set to be a tapered surface having a narrowest center in the
   up/down direction.    Then, when first suction and hold member 2022 moves upward
   while maintaining a passing manner of facing upward, first suction nozzle portion
10 2022b enters inlet region 2041a from a lower end of cylindrical guide 2040.        After
   having reached the lifted position, a leading end of first suction nozzle portion 2022b is
   positioned within center region 2041b.      More specifically, it is positioned near a
   narrowest center position within center region 2041b.       Accordingly, the entering of IC
   chip 2004 suctioned and held by first suction nozzle portion 2022b into cylindrical
15 guide 2040 passes through inlet region 2040a having a relatively large size, and moves
   within center region 204 1b having a gradually reduced inner diameter, so that it can
   move smoothly to a lifted position.
           On the other hand, second suction and hold member 2023 includes a first main
   body 2023a and a second main body 2023b which come closest to and separate from
20 each other in a horizontal direction.    Second suction nozzle portions 2023c are
   provided respectively at leading ends of first and second main bodies 2023a, 2023b.
   An arrangement interval of two second suction nozzle portions 2023c in the state where
   first main body 2023a and second main body 2023b come close to each other is set to
   match with an arrangement interval of first suction nozzle portion 2022b of first suction
25 and hold member 2022.       Further, a leading end of second suction nozzle portion
   2023c is opened, and the opened part communicates with suction passage 2023d
   formed within first and second main bodies 2023a, 2023b and second suction nozzle
   portions 2023c, and are connected to an unillustrated suction pump.
                                               - 63 -

           Moreover, this second suction and hold member 2023 is configured to move
   within a three dimensional space.       This movement is performed by a first robot 2049.
   In other words, first robot 2049 includes an arm 2044 of a SCARA robot moving in a
   horizontal plane, a support rod 2043 attached to be movable in an upward and
 5 downward directions to a leading end lower surface of arm 2044, and a base 2042
   attached to a lower end of support rod 2043.          By the horizontal movement of arm
   2044 of the SCARA robot and the upward and downward movement of support rod
   2043, base 2042 can be moved to a desired position within a three dimensional space.
   Then, first main body 2023a and second main body 2023b constituting second suction
10 and hold member 2023 are movably attached through sliders 2023e to guide rails 2042a
   provided at a lower surface of base 2042.         The movement of first main body 2023a
   and second main body 2023b is performed for example by cylinder driving.
   Accordingly, base 2042 and second suction and hold member 2023 supported on the
   lower surface of base 2042 move within the three dimensional space.             Further, first
15 main body 2023a and second main body 2023b come close to and separate from each
   other along guide rails 2042a.
           Specifically, second suction and hold member 2023 moves to a position of
   overlapping with cylindrical guide 2040 within the horizontal plane in accordance with
   the operation of arm 2044 of the SCARA robot, and support rod 2043 moves
20 downward while maintaining that state, so that second suction and hold member 2023
   reaches a lowered position.     At this time, first main body 2023a and second main body
   2023b are in a state of being close to each other.        In this state, as shown in Figs. 45A
   to 45C, 47B, and 48B, second suction nozzle portion 2023c enters outlet region 2041c
   from an upper end of cylindrical guide 2040.          Then, after reaching a lowermost end
25 position, a leading end of second suction nozzle portion 2023c is positioned within
   center region 2041b.     In this state, it is controlled to come close with a certain
   clearance (for example, about 0.5 mm) to a leading end of first suction nozzle portion
   2022b of first suction and hold member 2022 positioned at a lifted position.
                                                  - 64 -

           Accordingly, IC chip 2004 suctioned and held by first suction nozzle portion
   2022b waits in a state of being positioned in center region 2041 b of through-hole 2041
   of cylindrical guide 2040, and a lower end of second suction nozzle portion 2023c of
   second suction and hold member 2023 entered into cylindrical guide 2040 from above
 5 comes into contact with or close to IC chip 2004.      Then, suction by second suction
   nozzle portion 2023c is started, and suction by first suction nozzle portion 2022b is
   stopped at an appropriate timing, so that suctioning and holding of IC chip 2004 is
   shifted to the side of second suction and hold member 2023.
           As can be seen, the present embodiment is characterized in performing a
10 transfer of IC chip 2004 from first suction and hold member 2022 to second suction and
   hold member 2023 within cylindrical guide 2040.        Since IC chip 2004 has, for
   example, a small diameter of 3.5 mm and has a thin shape of base film 2005, holding
   with the suction and hold member cannot be performed firmly.        Therefore, when
   passing from first suction and hold member 2022 to second suction and hold member
15 2023 is performed in a state where IC chip 2004 is exposed, there is a likelihood that
   the passing cannot be performed smoothly and IC chip 2004 is dropped.        However, in
   the present embodiment, since the passing process is performed inside of cylindrical
   guide 2040, the passing can be performed assuredly.
           After that, first suction and hold member 2022 moves downward while
20 maintaining the passing manner.       When first suction nozzle portion 2022b goes out of
   cylindrical guide 2040, it rotates by 180 degrees, takes a take-out manner, and returns
   to a lowered position at an appropriate timing, and prepares for the next operation of
   taking out the IC chip.     On the other hand, second suction and hold member 2023
   having received IC chip 2004 moves upward along with the lifting of support rod 2043,
25 and second suction nozzle portion 2023c is positioned on an upper side of cylindrical
   guide 2040.     After that, second suction and hold member 2023 is moved in a
   horizontal direction by the operation of arm 2044 of the SCARA robot to reach the
   conveying-in position of conveying apparatus 2021.
                                               - 65 -

            Conveying apparatus 2021, as shown in Figs. 49A to 49B, includes a first
   receiving portion 2045 and a second receiving portion 2046 for receiving two IC chips
   2004 suctioned and held and conveyed by second suction and hold member 2023, and a
   drive mechanism 2047 for moving first receiving portion 2045 and second receiving
 5 portion 2046 forward and backward.        As shown in Figs. 50A and 50B by enlargement,
   first receiving portion 2045 includes, on an upper surface of two pillar portions 2045a
   separated into two legs facing upward, a recess 2045b accommodating IC chip 2004.
   An interval of pillar portions 2045a (recesses 2045b) is inconformity with the tabletting
   machine in the next stage, and is set to be longer than an arrangement pitch of IC chips
10 2004 in accommodation tape 2007 (an arrangement interval of first suction nozzle
   portion 2022b and second suction and hold member 2023).          Moreover, a bottom
   surface of recess 2045b communicates with suction passage 2045c formed within pillar
   portion 2045a and is connected to an unillustrated suction pump.      Accordingly, IC
   chip 2004 set within recess 2045b is suctioned and held within recess 2045b.       Even
15 when first receiving portion 2045 moves forward, IC chip 2004 moves forward with
   first receiving portion 2045 while being set within recess 2045b.
            Similarly, second receiving portion 2046 includes, on an upper surface of two
   pillar portions 2046a separated into two legs facing upward, recess 2046b for
   accommodating IC chip 2004.        An interval of pillar portions 2046a (recesses 2046b) is
20 in conformity with a tabletting machine in the next stage, and is set to be longer than an
   arrangement pitch of IC chips 2004 in accommodation tape 2007 (an arrangement
   interval of first suction nozzle portion 2022b and second suction and hold member
   2023).    Moreover, a bottom surface of recess 2046b communicates with suction
   passage 2046c formed within pillar portion 2046a and is connected to an unillustrated
25 suction pump.      Accordingly, IC chip 2004 set within recess 2046b is suctioned and
   held within recess 2046b.     Even when second receiving portion 2046 moves forward,
   IC chip 2004 moves forward with second receiving portion 2046 while being set within
   recess 2046b.
                                               - 66 -

            A drive mechanism 2047 for first receiving portion 2045 and second receiving
   portion 2046 includes a drive motor 2050, and a rack 2051 and a pinion 2052 which
   receive an output of drive motor 2050 and converts it into a reciprocating linear motion.
   First receiving portion 2045 and second receiving portion 2046 cooperate with
 5 corresponding rack 2051 respectively through coupling plates 2053, 2054 and move in
   a reverse direction.    In other words, when first receiving portion 2045 moves forward,
   second receiving portion 2046 moves backward.         When first receiving portion 2045
   moves forward, second receiving portion 2046 moves backward.           In other words, for
   example, when first receiving portion 2045 is at a conveying-in position, second
10 receiving portion 2046 is at a conveying-out position.      Moreover, for example, when
   first receiving portion 2045 is at a conveying-out position, second receiving portion
   2046 is at a conveying-in position.     Moreover, sliders 2055 are coupled to a lower
   surface of coupling plate 2053 and an upper surface of coupling plate 2054.       Sliders
   2055 are mounted respectively to corresponding guide rails 2056 and guides forward
15 and backward movement of rack 2051 and each of receiving portions 2045, 2046 along
   with rotation of pinion 2052.
            Second suction and hold member 2023 having received IC chip 2004 moves
   within a horizontal plane by means of arm 2044 of the SCARA robot, and is positioned
   above first receiving portion 2045 or second receiving portion 2046 positioned at a
20 conveying-in position.      As described above, since first receiving portion 2045 and
   second receiving portion 2046 move forward and backward in reverse directions with
   each other, first robot 2049 controls an operation of arm 2044 of the SCARA robot to
   position second suction and hold member 2023 alternately above the conveying-in
   position of first receiving portion 2045 and above the conveying-in position of second
25 receiving portion 2046.
            As described above, since intervals of pillar portions 2045 (recesses 2045b) of
   first receiving portion 2045 and pillar portions 2046a (recesses 2046b) of second
   receiving portion 2046 are widened, first robot 2049 performs a control of separating
   first main body 2023a and second main body 2023b of second suction and hold
                                              - 67 -

   member 2023 each other and widening an interval of second suction nozzle portions
   2023c during the horizontal movement of second suction and hold member 2023 by
   arm 2044 of the SCARA robot or at the time of being positioned above the conveying
   in position.   This widened interval of second suction nozzle portion 2023c is set to be
 5 equal to an interval of recesses 2045b, 2046b.
            Then, when support rod 2043 is moved downward in a state where first main
   body 2023a and second main body 2023b are separated from each other, as shown in
   Fig. 50A, a lower end of second suction nozzle portion 2023c of second suction and
   hold member 2023 enters into recess 2045b of first receiving portion 2045, so that IC
10 chip 2004 suctioned and held in a downward manner is set within recess 2045b.         Then,
   when suction on the side of second suction and hold member 2023 is released at an
   appropriate timing, IC chip 2004 is transferred to recess 2045b of first receiving portion
   2045.    Moreover, first receiving portion 2045 starts suction in advance or at an
   appropriate timing to suction and hold IC chip 2004 within recess 2045b.
15          Second suction and hold member 2023 having completed a supply of IC chip
   2004 to first receiving portion 2045 returns to a passing position within cylindrical
   guide 2040 by an operation of first robot 2049 and supplies a next passed IC chip to
   recess 2046b of second receiving portion 2046.
            On the other hand, first receiving portion 2045 having received a supply of IC
20 chip 2004 moves forward and is positioned at a conveying-out position.      IC chip 2004
   within recess 2045b of first receiving portion 2045 having reached the conveying-out
   position is suctioned and held by a second robot 2070, and transferred to tabletting
   machine 2002.     Second robot 2070 includes an arm 2071 of the SCARA robot moving
   within the horizontal plane, a support member 2072 attached movably upward and
25 downward on a leading end lower surface of arm 2071, and a pair of third suction
   nozzle portions 2073 attached to a lower end of support member 2072.
            A leading end of third suction nozzle portions 2073 is opened, and the opened
   part communicates with suction passages 2073a formed within third suction nozzle
   portion 2073 and is connected to an unillustrated suction pump.     Then, by the
                                               - 68 -

   horizontal movement of arm 2071 of the SCARA robot and the upward and downward
   movement of support member 2072, third suction nozzle portions 2073 can move to a
   desired position within the three dimensional space.     Further, an interval of the pair of
   third suction nozzle portions 2073 is in conformity with arrangement intervals of pillar
 5 portions 2045a (recesses 2045b9 of first receiving portion 2045 and pillar portions
   2046a (recesses 2046b) of second receiving portion 2046.
           Accordingly, suction by the suction pump is performed when the lower end of
   third suction nozzle portions 2073 has reached recess 2045b of first receiving portion
   2045 or recess 2046b of second receiving portion 2046 at the conveying-out position by
10 the operation of second robot 2070.      When the suction by the vacuum pump on the
   side of first receiving portion 2045 or second receiving portion 2046 is released, IC
   chip 2004 is suctioned and held on the side of third suction nozzle portion 2073 (refer
   to Fig. 50B).
           Next, when third suction nozzle portion 2073 suctioning and holding IC chip
15 2004 moves upward, horizontally, and downward by the operation of second robot
   2070, as shown in Figs. 42 and 51B, it is positioned within IC chip receiving portion
   2079 of rotary table 2075 of IC chip supply apparatus 2074 arranged on a conveying-in
   side of tabletting machine 2002.     When the suction by third suction nozzle portion
   2073 is released in this state, IC chip 2004 is supplied to IC chip receiving portion 2079.
20         Tabletting machine 2002 includes IC chip supply apparatus 2074 described
   above and a tabletting machine main body 2076.        Tabletting machine main body 2076
   is similar to a conventionally existing tabletting machine, and it fills pharmaceutical
   powder into a plurality of die holes 2078 provided at predetermined intervals on a
   circumference along an outer edge portion of rotating plate 2077, and compresses and
25 shapes the filled pharmaceutical powder with a lower pestle and an upper pestle to
   manufacture a tablet.    In the present embodiment, in order to manufacture an IC chip
   containing tablet, a function of firstly supplying IC chip 2004 by means of IC chip
   supply apparatus 2074 onto a predetermined amount of pharmaceutical powder
   supplied into die hole 2078, further filing pharmaceutical powder onto IC chip 2004,
                                               - 69 -

   and compressing and shaping these pharmaceutical powder and the IC chip from above
   and below is provided.      Details of the manufacturing processes for a tablet will be
   described later.
           IC chip supply apparatus 2074 as a main part of the present invention includes
 5 rotary table 2075 described above, and supplies and aligns IC chips 2004 supplied to
   rotary table 2075 within die holes 2078 of tabletting machine main body 2076.           Rotary
   table 2075 is rotated by a rotational force received from drive motor 2060.        In the
   present embodiment, it is controlled to rotate intermittently at 90 degrees intervals.
   Moreover, rotary table 2075 includes protruding parts 2075b protruding outward on an
10 outer circumference of plate-like main body 2075a at 90 degrees intervals.         An IC
   chip receiving portion 2079 is provided at this protruding part 2075b.       Since IC chips
   2004 are supplied in two-pieces unit from the side of supply apparatus 2003, two IC
   chip receiving portions 2079 are provided at each protruding part 2075b.         In the
   present embodiment, a position rotated by 180 degrees from supply apparatus 2003 on
15 an upstream side is a position of supplying IC chip 2004 to tabletting machine main
   body 2076.     Then, it is temporarily stopped at a position rotated by 90 degrees from
   the IC chip receiving position.     However, at this time, it is favorable to provide, for
   example, an inspection apparatus for performing an inspection on whether or not an IC
   chip is correctly supplied to IC chip receiving portion 2059.
20         As shown in Fig. 52 by enlargement, through-hole 2075b' penetrating up and
   down at a specified position of protruding part 2075b of rotary table 2075 is provided,
   and positioning guide 2061 is mounted to through-hole 2075b'.         This positioning guide
   2061 constitutes IC chip receiving portion 2059.       As shown in Figs. 53A to 53C,
   positioning guide 2061 has a ring-like basic shape having a through-hole penetrating up
25 and down.
           Positioning guide 2061 includes a flange portion 2065 protruding radially
   outward on an upper circumferential side surface of a cylindrical main body 2062, and
   a convex portion 2063 protruding upward is provided at a center of an upper surface of
   main body 2062.     Convex portion 2063 includes on its side surface a flat surface
                                               - 70 -

   2063a.    Convex portion 2063 is inserted into through-hole 2075b' of protruding part
   2075b, and flange portion 2065 is sandwiched and held by protruding part 2075b and
   main body 2075a.      Accordingly, movement of positioning guide 2061 in an axial
   direction, in other words, an up/down direction is suppressed, so that separation of
 5 positioning guide 2061 from rotary table 2075 is prevented.      Further, the inner
   circumferential surface shape of through-hole 205b' of protruding part 2075b is set to
   be substantially matching with the outer circumferential surface shape of convex
   portion 2063 of positioning guide 2061.     Accordingly, rotation of positioning guide
   2061 about an axis is prevented.     Accordingly, positioning guide 2061 is held by
10 rotary table 2075 at a correct position and in a correct manner.
           Through-hole 2066 provided at positioning guide 2061 is a tapered surface
   2066a in which a cross section in an upper region is circular and has a larger diameter
   as it goes upward.    This upper region is a region in which convex portion 2063 is
   mainly formed.     An inner diameter of through-hole 2066 at an upper end of convex
15 portion 2063 is larger than an outer diameter of IC chip 2004, and IC chip 2004
   suctioned and held by third suction nozzle portions 2073 enters through-hole 2066 of
   positioning guide 2061 along with lowering of third suction nozzle portion 2073.       The
   entering is guided by tapered surface 2066a to promote a smooth downward movement.
           Moreover, the inner circumferential surface in a portion of main body 2062 of
20 through-hole 2066 has a plurality of protrusions 2067 formed to protrude toward a
   center.   In the present embodiment, five protrusions 2067 are provided.       However,
   the number may be three for example, or any other number may be used.          A leading
   end position of protrusion 2067 is positioned on an imaginary circumference which is
   concentric with through-hole 2066 and has a predetermined diameter.         This
25 predetermined diameter may be equal to or slightly narrower than a diameter of IC chip
   2004.    Accordingly, a circumferential edge of IC chip 2004 inserted to through-hole
   2066 of positioning guide 2061 is supported by protrusions 2067, and held in a state
   where a center of IC chip 2004 matches with a center of positioning guide 2061
   (through-hole 2066).     Accordingly, positioning is performed with a high accuracy.
                                              -71 -

   Moreover, it is preferable to manufacture positioning guide 2061 with an elastic body
   such as rubber since it holds ICchip 2004 more firmly. Furthermore, protrusions
   2067 are preferably arranged at equal intervals in the circumferential direction.       It is
   preferable since IC chip 2004 is evenly supported.
 5         Further, in the present embodiment, a push-in portion 2064 is provided on a
   lower surface of main body 2062.       A planar shape of this push-in portion 2064 is
   substantially elliptical as shown in Fig. 53C.     In this example, it has a flat collapsed
   shape on both ends of elliptical shape on the long diameter side.       The planar shape of
   this push-in portion 2064 is based on a shape of a tablet to be manufactured, and is
10 slightly smaller than the tablet.   In other words, it has a shape slightly smaller than a
   cross-sectional shape of die hole 2078 formed in tabletting machine main body 2076.
   Moreover, push-in portion 2064 has a tapered surface 2064a having a peripheral
   surface becoming smaller as it goes downward.         Further, in the present embodiment,
   protrusions 2067 formed on the inner circumferential surface of through-hole 2066 is
15 formed to a lower end of this push-in portion 2064.
           Next, a supply of IC chip 2004 from supply apparatus 2003 to IC chip supply
   apparatus 2074 and a supply operation of IC chip 2004 to tabletting machine will be
   described, and a configuration of IC chip supply apparatus 2074 will be described.
   Figs. 54A and 55A show a state where a leading end of third suction nozzle portion
20 2073 of supply apparatus 2003 is inserted into positioning guide 2061 constituting IC
   chip receiving portion 2059.      As shown in the drawings, second suction and hold
   member 2023 moves downward, and a leading end of third nozzle portion 2073 in a
   state of suctioning and holding IC chip 2004 enters through-hole 2066 of positioning
   guide 2061, and stops at an appropriate position of main body 2062.         At this
25 appropriate position, IC chip 2004 is supported by protrusions 2067.         Since suction by
   third suction nozzle portion 2073 is performed until reaching this stopped position, IC
   chip 2004 moves downward while maintaining a horizontal state in a downward
   manner having chip main body 2006 below, and at the lower stopping position of third
                                               - 72 -

   suction nozzle portion 2073, IC chip 2004 comes into contact with a plurality of
   protrusions 2067 in a horizontal manner.
           Next, suction by third suction nozzle portion 2073 is released, and third suction
   nozzle portion 2073 moves upward and separates from positioning guide 2061, and
 5 goes on to take next IC chip.     On the other hand, IC chip 2004 in a downward manner
   remaining in positioning guide 2061 is supported in a state of maintaining a horizontal
   manner by means of protrusions 2067 of positioning guide 2061.           Further, as
   described above, a centering of IC chip 2004 is also performed with a high accuracy.
           Drawings subsequent to Figs. 54B and 55B show a supply position to tabletting
10 machine 2002 in which rotary table 2075 is rotated by 180 degrees from the state of
   Figs. 54A and 55A.      At this supply position, two pushes 2082 are suspended and
   formed at a leading end lower surface of an L-shaped plate 2081 moving upward and
   downward with a driving of first cylinder 2080.      Two pushers 2082 are in conformity
   with an arrangement pitch of two positioning guides 2061 adjacent to each other in a
15 circumferential direction, and are adjusted so that an axis center of each positioning
   guide 2061 and an axis center of pusher 2082 matches when the rotary table is
   temporarily stopped.
           Further, first cylinder 2080, L-shaped plate 2081, pushers 2082, and rotary table
   2075 are movable upward and downward integrally.           Then, the upward and downward
20 movement is performed by receiving driving of second cylinder 2083.
           Therefore, by appropriately switching the reciprocating operation of first
   cylinder 2080 and second cylinder 2083, positions of rotary table 2075 and pushers
   2082 can be changed.       For example, Figs. 54B and 55B shows a state in which second
   cylinder 2083 allows first cylinder 2080, L-shaped plate 2081, pushers 2082, and rotary
25 table 2075 to be positioned at a lifted position, and first cylinder 2080 further allows
   pushers 2082 to be positioned at a lifted position.    In this state, rotary table 2075
   separates apart from an upper surface of rotating plate 2077 of tabletting machine main
   body 2076, and positioning guide 2061 also separates apart from an upper surface of
   rotating plate 2077.    Moreover, a lower surface of pusher 2082 is positioned on an
                                               - 73 -

   upper side of positioning guide 2061, and IC chip 2004 in a downward manner
   supported by pushers 2082 and positioning guide 2061 is in a non-contact state.         This
   state is an initial state in which rotary table 2075 is rotated to reach a supply position
   and temporarily stopped.
 5          Next, only second cylinder 2083 is operated to allow first cylinder 2080, L
   shaped plate 2081, pushers 2082, and rotary table 2075 to be positioned at a lowered
   position.    Accordingly, as shown in Figs. 54C and 55C, rotary table 2075 comes close
   to an upper surface of rotating plate 2077 of tabletting machine main body 2076, so that
   a lower surface of main body 2062 of positioning guide 2061 comes into contact with
10 an upper surface of rotating plate 2077.       Further, push-in portion 2064 enters die hole
   2078, and comes into contact with pharmaceutical powder filled in die hole 2078.
   Moreover, at this time, since first cylinder 2080 remains in the initial state, a relative
   positional relationship between pushers 2082 and positioning guide 2061 does not
   change, and a lower surface of pusher 2082 is positioned on an upper side of
15 positioning guide 2061, and pusher 2082 and IC chip 2004 in a downward manner
   supported by positioning guide 2061 are in a non-contact state.
            After that, first cylinder 2080 moves while second cylinder 2083 maintaining
   the above-described state, and pusher 2082 moves downward.            Accordingly, as shown
   in Figs. 54D and 55D, a lower end of pusher 2082 reaches a lower end of positioning
20 guide 2061, in other words, a lower end of push-in portion 2064, and IC chip 2004 is
   forced downward by pusher 2082 and pushed out from positioning guide 2061, and
   pushed into pharmaceutical powder 2090.          Also during this downward movement of
   IC chip 2004 by pusher 2082, IC chip 2004 moves while maintaining a horizontal state
   and centering by protrusions 2067 of positioning guide 2061.         Accordingly, when
25 being pushed out of positioning guide 2061 and finally pushed in and supplied to
   pharmaceutical powder 2090, it is supplied with a high accuracy to a center of a surface
   of pharmaceutical powder 2090 filled in die hole 2078.         Moreover, since IC chip 2004
   is pushed by pusher 2082 into pharmaceutical powder 2090 before being compressed
   by the tabletting machine main body, the positional displacement is suppressed.
                                                 - 74 -

           Further, since IC chip 2004 is pushed into pharmaceutical powder 2090 in a
   downward manner in which chip main body 2006 is positioned below, chip main body
   2006 is further inserted into pharmaceutical powder 2090 with respect to a surface of
   pharmaceutical powder 2090 to which, for example, base film 2005 comes into contact.
 5 Therefore, even when IC chip 2004 attempts to move in a horizontal direction, chip
   main body 2006 serves as a wedge, so that the positional displacement due to lateral
   movement can be suppressed assuredly.
           Further, in the present embodiment, as described above, the horizontal state and
   centering can be maintained with a high accuracy by protrusions 2067 of positioning
10 guide 2061.    Thus, since it can be supplied to a center of pharmaceutical powder 2090
   assuredly, positioning is ensured without performing an inspection after the supply on
   whether or not a supply to a correct position is performed.    Accordingly, even in a
   case where an inspection apparatus is provided, it may be, for example, a simple sensor
   which confirms presence of a supply, and it can be applied to an apparatus for which a
15 space cannot be reserved for installation.
           Figs. 56A to 56K shows an operation of tabletting machine main body 2076.
   As shown in Fig. 56A, in a lower side of die hole 2078, a lower pestle 2092 is fitted
   from below so as to be slidable up and down.      As shown in Fig. 561, in an upper side
   of die hole 2078, an upper pestle 2093 is provided movably upward and downward.
20 As shown in Fig. 56A, firstly, in a state where lower pestle 2092 is lowered within die
   hole 2078, pharmaceutical powder 2094 is filled in die hole 2078 by means of
   pharmaceutical powder filling apparatus 2094.      Next, as lower pestle 2092 is lifted, a
   supply by means of pharmaceutical powder filling apparatus 2094 is cut, so that a
   predetermined amount of pharmaceutical powder 2090 is filled in a leveled state in a
25 space of die hole 2078 formed on an upper side of lower pestle 2092 (Fig. 56B).       After
   that, lower pestle 2092 is lowered by a predetermined quantity, so that a surface of
   pharmaceutical powder 2090 is slightly lowered from an upper surface of rotating plate
   2077 (Fig. 56C).
                                              - 75 -

            In this state, by IC chip supply apparatus 2074 described above, positioning
   guide 2061 in which IC chip 2004 in a downward manner is set enters die hole 2078
   (Fig. 56D), pushes out IC chip 2004 by means of pusher 2082, and pushes it into
   pharmaceutical powder 2090 (Fig. 56E).
 5          Next, rotating plate 2077 rotates so that a die hole at the supply positions
   proceeds to the next step (Fig. 56F).      In a state where lower pestle 2092 is lowered
   within die hole 2078, pharmaceutical powder 2090 is filled and supplied into die hole
   2078 by means of pharmaceutical powder filling apparatus 2094 (Fig. 56G).           Next,
   lower pestle 2092 is lifted, and a supply by means of pharmaceutical powder filling
10 apparatus 2094 is cut, so that a predetermined amount of pharmaceutical powder 2090
   is filled in a leveled state in a space of die hole 2078 formed on an upper side of lower
   pestle 2092 (Fig. 56H).
            Next, upper pestle2093 moves downward, and pharmaceutical powder 2090 is
   compressed between upper pestle 2093 and lower pestle 2092 (Fig. 561).           Accordingly,
15 pharmaceutical powder 2090 is solidified to manufacture IC chip-containing tablet
   2095 (Fig. 56J).      After that, lower pestle 2092 further moves upward, so that
   manufactured tablet 2095 is discharged.
            <Modified Example>
   Push-in portion 2064 is not always necessary.         Without providing push-in portion
20 2064, in a state where a lower surface of main body 2062 is in contact with an upper
   surface of rotating plate 2077, IC chip 2004 may be pushed out with a pusher.         In this
   case, pharmaceutical powder in the die hole may be filled to an upper end of the die
   hole to be in a leveled state.
            Further, when push-in portion 2064 is provided as in the above-described
25 embodiment, push-in portion 2064 may enter die hole 2078 to further push in the
   pharmaceutical powder filled in die hole 2078.         Accordingly, a recess having an inner
   shape in conformity with an outer shape of push-in portion 2064 is formed on a surface
   of the pharmaceutical powder.        Accordingly, since IC chip 2004 is set within the
                                                 - 76 -

   recess, the positional displacement due to the lateral movement can be suppressed
   assuredly.
            Moreover, even in the case where push-in portion 2064 is provided, push-in
   portion 2064 may be set so as not to come into contact with pharmaceutical powder.
 5 For example, depending on a material of pharmaceutical powder, pharmaceutical
   powder may be attached to a surface of push-in portion 2064 by contact, or
   pharmaceutical powder may be dispersed to a periphery at the time of contact.       In
   such a case, providing push-in portion 2064 at a position not in contact with
   pharmaceutical powder may avoid the problem.
10          Moreover, in the above-described embodiment, IC chip 2004 is pushed into
   pharmaceutical powder 2090.        However, the present invention is not limited to this.
   For example, IC chip 2004 may remain on the surface of pharmaceutical powder 2090
   by a dropping supply,     For example, when IC chip 2004 is pushed into pharmaceutical
   powder 2090, the force of pushing-in may cause pharmaceutical powder 2090 to fly, so
15 that it may affect the detection of presence of an IC chip in the subsequent step,    By
   not pushing in the IC chip, the influence can be suppressed as soon as possible.
   Moreover, when the dropping supply is performed, it is favorable that the falling
   distance is small.
            Even in the case of providing protrusions, positioning guide 2061 may be
20 omitted at the lower end rather than forming it to the lower end.    In such a case, for
   example, protrusions may be formed only at the main body portion, and the protrusions
   may be omitted entirely or partially at the portion corresponding to the push-in portion.
            It should be noted that, in the above-described embodiment, positioning guide
   2061 including at its inner circumferential surface protrusions 2067 is provided, and it
25 is pushed by a pusher in a state where IC chip 2004 is set within positioning guide 2061.
   However, the present invention is not limited to this.    For example, suction means
   may be used in place of the pusher, and the IC chip suctioned by suction means may be
   pushed into the pharmaceutical powder within the die hole to supply the same.
                                                - 77 -

           Furthermore, in the above-described embodiment, a lower end of positioning
   guide 2061 (push-in portion 2064) enters die hole 2078 by upward and downward
   movement.      However, positioning guide 2061 and rotary table 2075 may be not
   moved upward and downward.         By omitting the step of moving upward and
 5 downward, a cycle time is shortened, and the process can be speeded up.        In this case,
   IC chip 2004 is supplied by dropping it into die hole 2078.
           Moreover, in the above-described embodiment, the IC chip is supplied into
   pharmaceutical powder in a downward manner.        However, it may be supplied in an
   upward manner,
10         The tablet manufacturing apparatus is (1) a tablet manufacturing apparatus,
   which manufactures an IC chip- containing tablet by supplying an IC chip on
   pharmaceutical powder filled in a die hole, further filling pharmaceutical powder onto
   the IC chip, and compressing these pharmaceutical powder and the IC chip from above
   and below, and it includes supply means which performs a supply of the IC chip by
15 pushing in the IC chip into pharmaceutical powder in a state where the IC chip is
   positioned above pharmaceutical powder within a die hole before being compressed.
           Since the IC chip is supplied by pushing into pharmaceutical powder before
   being compressed, it can be supplied to a desired position with a high accuracy, so that
   the positional displacement can be suppressed.
20          (2) The IC chip includes a convex portion on one surface, and it is favorable to
   supply the IC chip by pushing the convex portion into pharmaceutical powder in a
   downward manner with the convex portion provided on a lower side.          The convex
   portion corresponds to chip main body 6 in the embodiment.       It is not limited to attach
   chip main body 6 to base film 6 as in the embodiment.      For example, it can be applied
25 to various forms such as having a convex portion on a surface of the chip main body of
   the embodiment.     According to the present invention, the convex portion is further
   inserted into pharmaceutical powder.     Accordingly, for example, the convex portion
   serves as a wedge even when the IC chip attempts to move in the horizontal direction,
                                             - 78 -

   and the positional displacement due to the lateral movement can be suppressed
   assuredly.
             (3) The IC chip is set in the accommodation portion provided on a carrier tape
   in an upward manner with the convex portion on an upper side, and is accommodated
 5 in an accommodation tape having an opening side of the accommodation portion
   covered with a top tape, and it may be configured such that the IC chip in an upward
   manner is taken out from the accommodation portion, and the taken out IC chip may be
   reversed upside down to be in a downward manner, and may be supplied by supply
   means.     Accordingly, even with the one supplied in an upward manner, it can be
10 converted into a downward manner and supplied to the pharmaceutical powder.
             (4) The supply means may include a position guide holding an IC chip within
   a through-hole penetrating up and down, and pushing means which is arranged on an
   upper side of the positioning guide and pushes out the IC chip downward.
            Since the IC chip is pushed in and supplied to pharmaceutical powder before
15 being compressed, it can be supplied to a desired position with a high accuracy, so that
   the positional displacement can be suppressed.
            An manner position converting apparatus is (1) an manner converting apparatus
   which changes an manner of an electronic part by passing an electronic part suctioned
   and held by a first suction and hold member to a second suction and hold member
20 suctioning the same, and it is configured to perform the passing in a state where a
   suction portion of the first suction and hold member and a suction portion of the second
   suction and hold member are inserted into through-holes of a guide member having the
   through-holes at both ends.     The electronic part corresponds to the IC chip of the
   embodiment.      In the embodiment, the IC chip is provided in a tablet.   However, the
25 present invention can be applied not only to this but also to various electronic parts.
   Moreover, the through-holes of the present invention are opened at both ends, and the
   first suction and hold member and second suction and hold member enter into the
   through-holes respectively through the openings on both ends.       However, for example,
   a part of the side surface of the through-hole may be opened by a slit or other structure.
                                               - 79 -

   It should be noted that the manner converting apparatus may be used for any
   application other than the tablet manufacturing apparatus.
            Since the passing of electronic parts between the suction and hold members is
   performed within the guide members (through-holes), the passing can be performed
 5 assuredly without any influence from outside or peripheral atmosphere.
              (2) The cylindrical guide is may be configured so that inner shape dimensions
   of the through-hole is formed to be wide at both ends and narrow at an intermediate
   position, and passing is performed at the intermediate position.      In such a manner,
   since the both ends are wide, both suction and hold members can smoothly enter at the
10 leading end into the cylindrical guide, and the passing is performed at the narrow space,
   it is preferable.    The narrow space at the intermediate position may be formed to have
   an inner shape dimension shape corresponding to the outer dimension shape of the
   electronic part.     The corresponding inner shape dimensions shape may be set equal to
   or larger than the outer dimension shape.
15            (3) The electronic part is accommodated in an accommodation tape, and the
   first suction and hold member may be configured to suction and hold the electronic part
   within the accommodation tape, rotate it by a set angle, and insert the electronic part
   into a guide member.       (4) The set angle may be 180 degrees.    It is favorable since a
   reverse apparatus for reversing an electronic part upside down can be configured in a
20 simple manner.
             (5) It is favorable that the guide member is constituted of a fixed cylindrical
   guide.    This cylindrical guide is achieved in the embodiment.      It is favorable since it
   can be achieved with a simple configuration.        (6) The guide member includes a
   plurality of moving guide members and a drive mechanism for allowing the moving
25 guide members to come close to and separate from each other, and it is favorable to
   form through-holes by allowing the plurality of moving guide members to come close
   to each other.     In this manner, by separating the moving guide members, a space wider
   than the through-hole is reserved, and for example, even in a case where a positional
   displacement occurs at the time of suctioning and holding an electronic part by means
                                                - 80 -

   of the first suction and hold member, when the moving guide members are moved to
   come close to each other in the state where the first suction and hold member is
   positioned at the passing position of the electronic part to the second suction and hold
   member, a leading end of the moving guide members come into contact with a side
 5 surface of the electronic part to move to a center and position the same, so that it is
   favorable.
            Accordingly, passing of the electronic part can be performed assuredly.
   To solve the problem described above, an IC chip supply apparatus of the present
   invention is (1) an IC supply apparatus in a tablet manufacturing apparatus for
10 manufacturing IC chip-containing tablets by supplying an IC chip onto pharmaceutical
   powder filled in a die hole, further filling pharmaceutical powder onto the IC chip, and
   compressing these pharmaceutical powder and the IC chip from above and below, and
   it includes a positioning guide holding the IC chip within a through-hole penetrating up
   and down, and pushing-out means arranged on an upper side of the positioning guide
15 and pushing out the IC chip downward, and a plurality of protrusions protruding toward
   a center is included inside of the through-hole, and the IC chip is held by the
   protrusions.    The pushing-out means corresponds to pusher 2082 in the embodiment.
            According to the present invention, by the protrusions of the positioning guide,
   the IC chip is set and held with a high accuracy at a desired position in a cross section
20 within the through-hole.    Thus, the IC chip can be supplied at a desired position within
   a die hole corresponding to the set position.    Accordingly, for example, it can be
   assuredly supplied to a center of pharmaceutical powder, positioning can be secured
   without performing an inspection on whether or not a supply is performed to a correct
   position after the supplying operation.     Accordingly, for example, even in the case
25 where the inspection apparatus is provided, it may be a simple sensor which confirms
   presence of a supply, and an apparatus which cannot reserve a space for installation can
   be used.
             (2) The plurality of protrusion may be convex threads extending along an axial
   direction of the through-hole.    (3) The convex threads may be formed to a lower end
                                                -81 -

   of the through-hole.    In such a manner, the positioning can be performed until
   immediately before pushing out from a lower end of the positioning guide, thus it is
   preferable.
             (4) The positioning guide may be provided with a push-in portion protruding
 5 downward at a lower surface, and the push-in portion may enter the die hole.          In such
   a manner, since the push-in portion enters the die hole, the IC chip can be supplied to a
   desired position within the die hole.
             (5) The positioning guide may be provided at a rotation member, and may
   have a function of holding with the protrusions the IC chip by inserting the IC chip
10 from above with respect to the positioning guide located at the receiving position, and
   the positioning guide holding the IC chip may rotate with the rotation of the rotation
   member and positioned on an upper side of the die hole of the tabletting machine, and
   the IC chip held by the pushing-out means may allow an IC chip to be supplied into a
   die hole.    The passing of the IC chip from an apparatus on an upstream side, and a
15 supply of an IC chip to a tabletting machine can be performed simultaneously, so that
   the productivity is improved.
             (6) A tablet manufacturing apparatus of the present invention may include
   means for filling pharmaceutical powder into a die hole, the IC chip supply apparatus
   according to any one of (1) to (5) supplying an IC chip onto the pharmaceutical powder,
20 means for filling pharmaceutical powder from above the supplied IC chip, and means
   for manufacturing an IC chip-containing tablet by compressing these pharmaceutical
   powder and the IC chip from above and below.
           By the plurality of protrusions provided at the positioning guide, the IC chip is
   held at a desired position, and supplied into the die hole in that state, so that it can be
25 supplied to a desired position with a high accuracy, and the positional displacement can
   be suppressed.
