   Field of the Invention
 5 The present invention relates to a food scoring implement
   for scoring food such as but not limited to squid,
   calamari or other food prior to cooking to obtain a
   crosshatched pattern.
10 Background
   One of the most popular ways of preparing squid for
   consumption involves partially scoring the inside surface
   of a squid or calamari tube with a series of diagonal cuts
15 to produce a crosshatched pattern or "pineapple cut"                squid
   or calamari. The pineapple cuts are typically done by hand
   with a very sharp filleting knife;                however, this technique
   is time consuming and requires a high degree of knife
   skills to achieve good results. The technique may involve
20 up to 100 knife cuts per average-sized squid.
   Summary of the Invention
   The present invention provides a food scoring implement
25 comprising:
            a body portion having a guiding edge;
            a handle portion extending from the body portion;
            a plurality of blades extending from the body
   portion, wherein each blade has a cutting edge that is at
30 least partially convexly curved;
            wherein the guiding edge is spaced apart from and
   positioned relative to the blades                such that the guiding
   edge is contactable with a surface of the food and capable
   of supporting the implement on the surface when the
35 cutting edges of the blades cut through at least a portion
   of the food.

   a second direction that is different from or opposite to
   the first direction. At least                    some of the blades may be
   parallel to each other. The blades may extend between 20
   30mm from the body portion.
25
   The handle portion may extend from a rear surface of the
   body portion opposite a front surface of the body portion.

   Detailed Description
30
   Figures 1 to 5 show a food scoring implement           10 according
   to an embodiment of the invention. The implement           10
   comprises a body portion 12 having a guiding or supporting
   edge 18.       The implement 10 also has a handle portion 14
35 extending in a first direction from the body portion 12.
   The implement           10 also has a plurality of blades 16
   extending in a second direction from the body portion 12.
   9634291_1 (GHMatters) P104390.AU.1 8/11/2017

                                                - 5
   Each blade 16 has a cutting edge 31 that is at least
   partially convexly curved.
   The guiding edge 18 is spaced apart from the blades 16 and
 5 positioned relative to the blades                 16 such that the guiding
   edge 18 is contactable with a surface 20                 (such as a flat
   surface) of the food 22 when the blades                 16 cut through at
   least a portion of the food. The guiding edge 18                 supports
   the implement           10 on the surface of the food 22       during
10 cutting. Thus, with particular reference to Figure 2, a
   user of the implement 10 may rest the guiding edge 18 on
   the surface 20 of the food, press the cutting edges of the
   blades to a desired depth into the food, and glide the
   implement across the surface 20 while the guiding edge 18
15 remains in contact with the surface. In this manner, the
   guiding edge 18             can be used to assist in maintaining a
   constant depth of cut.               Further, the depth of the cuts can
   be varied simply by pivoting the implement about the
   guiding edge 18.
20
   The implement           10 is particularly useful for creating a
   crosshatched pattern in squid or calamari so as to produce
   "pineapple cut calamari". However it will be appreciated
   that the implement may also be useful to prepare other
25 types of        food for consumption. In addition to an aesthetic
   purpose of preparing a squid or calamari with "pineapple
   cuts", these cuts may also increase the surface area of
   the squid or calamari for sauces to adhere to.
30 A user may create the crosshatched pattern by gripping the
   handle portion             (or "handle") 14, placing the blades 16 on
   a surface 20 of a flattened sheet of calamari or other
   food 22,       applying pressure to partially cut into the
   calamari with the blades                 16, and traversing the blades 16
35 across the sheet 22 to create a series of linear, parallel
   cuts. The implement may therefore allow a user to prepare
   pineapple cut calamari more efficiently and neatly than
   9634291_1 (GHMatters) P104390.AU.1 8/11/2017

                                                  - 6
   when using a single-blade knife. For comparison, as
   previously mentioned preparing a squid with "pineapple
   cuts" using a single blade knife may involve up to 100
   cuts or more, whereas using the food scoring implement                         10
 5 may only involve 5 cuts                  for a squid of average size.
   In this embodiment, the body portion 12 has a generally
   rectangular prism or cuboid shape with six substantially
   flat faces or           surfaces: a front surface 24a, a rear
10 surface 24b, side surfaces 24c and 24d, a top surface 24e
   and a bottom surface 24f. The body portion 12                      is
   preferably made from cast polyurethane, but may be formed
   from any other suitable material. Additionally, the body
   portion 12 has a cavity 32 opening up to the front surface
15 24a    for receiving the blades                  16, which will be described
   in more detail below. The guiding edge 18 is contiguous
   with at least the front                  face 24a of the body portion. In
   this example, the guiding edge 18 comprises a peripheral
   edge of the front face 24a that is positioned in front of
20 the cutting edges 31 of the blades                     16.
   In a specific example and with particular reference to
   Figures 3 and 4, the body portion 12 has the following
   dimensions:          a length "L"          of between 20mm-40mm, such as
25 30mm;     a width "W"          of between 90mm-110mm, such as           98mm;  and
   a   depth "D"        of between 15mm-30mm,            such as 25mm.   In  this
   example, the blades                16 extend altogether      in the same
   direction away from the front surface 24a of the body
   portion 12,          more specifically, perpendicularly from the
30 front surface 24a. The handle 14 extends also
   perpendicularly, but from the rear surface 24b, which is
   opposite the front               surface 24a. The handle 14 and the
   blades 16 therefore project in opposite directions with
   respect to the body portion 12.
35
   The implement           10 preferably comprises 15-20 blades 16,
   specifically 18 blades in this embodiment. However, it
   9634291_1 (GHMatters) P104390.AU.1   8/11/2017

                                                  - 7
   will be appreciated that in other embodiments any suitable
   number of blades 16 may be provided. Each blade 16 forms
   part of a respective cutting element 26 having a support
   end portion 28a and an oppositely disposed cutting end
 5 portion featuring 28b the blade 16.                    In this embodiment,
   the cutting edge 31 of each blade is convexly curved and
   taper towards a tip 29 of the blade 16. The blades 16 may
   be partially or fully curved. In this example, the
   curvature of the blades                  16 decreases closer towards the
10 tip.
   The curved nature of the blades 16 may provide the
   advantage of a smoother, streamline and more effortless
   traverse of the blades 16 across the food surface compared
15 to a straight blade. This                    is due to the curved edge
   allowing for a more gradual introduction of the cutting
   edge in the material being cut, whereas straight blades
   may experience stalling through the material. Moreover, as
   illustrated in Figures                  6 and 7, when cutting through a
20 material a leading edge portion A of a curved blade 16 has
   less      surface area in contact with the material being cut,
   and thus less            friction, compared to a leading edge portion
   B of a straight blade 44.                    Further, as more depth to the
   cuts is required, the implement 10 can be pivoted about
25 the guiding edge 18,                resulting in the curved blades
   rolling into the material more easily. The blades                    16  (and
   cutting elements 26) are preferably formed from surgical
   stainless steel, which can be made very sharp, but can
   comprise or consist of any suitable material.
30
   In this embodiment, the blades 16 are fixed in position
   relative to each other and the body portion 12.                    The
   cutting elements 26 are disposed parallel to one another
   and in one row. In this regard, the support end portions
35 28a of each cutting element 26 are embedded in a block 30,
   such as a solid resin block. The cutting elements 26 and
   block 30 may be referred to as a cutting assembly. The
   9634291_1  (GHMatters) P104390.AU.1  8/11/2017

                                                 - 8
   block 30 is in turn received and secured in the cavity 32
   of the body portion 12.                 The cutting end portions 28b
   project from the block 30                   (and thus also from the body
   portion 12)          by a length "P", preferably by 20-30mm.
 5 According to a specific example, the length "P"                    is 27mm.
   This length of blade provides an advantage that if
   desired, a user may cut the calamari                    (or other meat) into
   separate strips by pressing the implement 10 to a
   sufficient extent so that the blades cut right through the
10 calamari, thus producing spaghetti-like pieces.
   The block 30 is removably insertable into the cavity 32 of
   the body portion 12.               The cavity 32 opens up to the front
   surface 24a when unoccupied by the block 30.                    The block 30
15 and the cavity 32 are sized such that when the block 30
   occupies the cavity 32,                 an exposed surface 34 of the block
   30 is flush with the front surface 24a. To secure the
   block 30 to the body portion 12,                   one or more fastening
   elements        such as bolts 33 may be used. The bolts             33 in
20 this example extend through the top surface 24e of the
   body portion and into the block 30.                   The bolts 33 can be
   stainless steel retaining screws.
   To remove the block 30,                 for instance for cleaning or
25 replacement purposes, a user can unscrew or otherwise
   remove the bolts 33 and pull out the block 30.                    The cutting
   elements 26 and respective block 30                   can be interchanged
   with other cutting elements embedded in another block. It
   is contemplated that a user may own several different
30 blocks 30 embedded with different numbers and/or types of
   blades to be used interchangeably as needed. For example,
   a user may have a kit of blocks including a block with the
   18 blades described above for scoring calamari, and
   another block with only 10 blades that are more spaced
35 apart from each other for scoring pork skin.
   The handle 14 in this embodiment comprises an elongate
   9634291_1 (GHMatters) P104390.AU.1  8/11/2017

                                                 -  9
   structure 36 that is bent or otherwise shaped into a
   suitable non-linear form for the purposes of a handle. The
   elongate        structure 36 comprises metal that is bent into a
   desirable handle shape. Preferably, the elongate metal
 5 structure 36 is a 3-5mm diameter stainless steel wire. The
   elongate        structure 36 comprises two ends              38a and 38b that
   are    symmetrically fixed               (and in this example, embedded) to
   substantially opposite end portions of the rear surface
   24b of the body portion 12. A middle portion 40 of the
10 elongate        structure 36 is, during manufacturing,
   manipulated into a projected handle shape including a
   gripping portion 42.               Using an elongate metal wire for the
   handle 14 provides the advantage of being easy and cost
   effective to manufacture, while potentially also
15 minimising the weight of the implement                     10.
   The guiding edge 18 in this embodiment is in proximity to
   a position from which the blades 16 project from the body
   portion, but spaced apart from the blades 16 by a distance
20 "S",     as shown in Figure             5. Specifically, the guiding edge
   18 is spaced apart from the blades                     16 by portions of the
   block 30 and front               face 24a situated between the blades 16
   and edge 18.          In this embodiment, the guiding edge 18 is
   also substantially parallel to the row of blades                      16. A
25 shortest distance between the guiding edge 18 and the row
   of blades         (i.e. the distance "S")             may be about  6-10mm.
   As described above, in this embodiment, an edge of the
   front surface 24a provides or is the guiding edge 18. More
30 specifically, when the implement 10                     is in a position for
   use     (as shown in Figure 2),                 the guiding edge 18 is
   positioned below the cutting elements 26.                      Therefore, the
   guiding edge 18             is a substantially straight edge at the
   junction of the front surface 24a and the bottom surface

   The guiding edge 18 can be used by placing the edge 18 on

                                                 - 10
   the food surface 20,                rocking or pivoting the implement        10
   about the edge 18 to contact the food surface 20 with the
   blades 16, and pressing down on the blades 16 to cut into
   the food to a desired depth. Thus the edge 18 may assist
 5 in making an accurate first cut. A user may also better
   control the implement 10 if while gripping the handle                       14
   the user places their forefinger on the top surface 24e of
   the implement           10.    The user may also continue to use the
   guiding edge 18             for depth control when traversing the
10 blades 18 across the food surface to make the parallel
   cuts.     In that case,            since a substantially straight edge
    (such as the guiding edge 18,                    as opposed to a guiding
   surface) has minimal surface contact area with the food
   surface 20 while cutting, there is little friction with
15 the food surface 20. This allows for a smoother cutting
   experience.
   Another advantage of embodiments of the food scoring
   implement        10 herein described its lightweight and simple
20 construction. For instance, the embodiment shown in
   Figures 1-5 may be constructed with only 5 pieces:                      the
   block 30        (embedded with places);              the body portion 12;   the
   blades 16;         the handle portion 14;             and the bolts 33.
   Accordingly, the implement 10 can be easily manufactured
25 and transported. Furthermore, constructing the handle
   portion 14         from an elongate element minimises its weight.
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
30 departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For
   example, according to another embodiment of the invention
   the body portion 12 and the handle portion 14 may be
   integrally formed as one piece. Further, the handle
   portion 14 may extend in a different direction and may
35 indeed have different forms to those discussed above, such
   as an arch attached to the body portion 12.
