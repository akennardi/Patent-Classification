   Field
15
   The present invention relates to a gaming system, a method
   of gaming and a game controller.
   Background
20
   Current electronic gaming machines allow a player to place
   a wager or bet, in return for which a play of the game
   provided by the gaming machine is conducted. Many gaming
   machines implement a base game and a feature game which is
25 triggered from the base game if one or more trigger
   conditions are met. Normally, the feature game has some
   different rules to the base game: for example, a sequence
   of free base games or a completely different game.                        A
   typical trigger condition is the occurrence of a
30 particular symbol combination in the base game. In some
   games, a player must place an additional, ante bet to be
   eligible for the feature  (or for a particular variant of
   the feature).
35 While such gaming machines provide users with enjoyment, a
   need exists for alternative gaming systems in order to
   maintain or increase player enjoyment.

   General construction of gaming system
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
   a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
 5 wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
10 the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
15 gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
20 and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
25 wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.         For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
30 depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system comprises
35 several core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
                                          10153925_1 (GHMatters) P76814.AU.5 12/04/2018

                               - 10
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions and play the game.
 5
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
10 mechanism 56 comprising one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions                  (e.g. to
   place bets),  and one or more speakers 58.
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
15 player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play instructions are stored
   as program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
20 Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:                   a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
25  (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
30 displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
35 mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
                                           10153925_1 (GHMatters) P76814.AU.5 12/04/2018

                               - 11
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   A player marketing module  (not shown) having a
   reading device may also be provided for the purpose of
   reading a player tracking device, for example as part of a
 5 loyalty program.   The player tracking device may be in the
   form of a card, flash drive or any other portable storage
   medium capable of being read by the reading device.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
10 pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.             Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.    A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
15 from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
20 crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.    The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
25 type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
30
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102.   Instructions and data to control
   operation of the processor 102 are stored in a memory 103,
   which is in data communication with the processor 102.
35 Typically, the gaming machine 100 will include both
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
   type of memory, with such memories being collectively
                                            10153925_1 (GHMatters) P76814.AU.5 12/04/2018

                              - 12
   represented by the memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
 5 player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.  The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
10 for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.              Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
15
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 comprise one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107, a card and/or ticket reader
20 108, a printer 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input
   mechanism 110 and a coin output mechanism 111.                 Additional
   hardware may be included as part of the gaming machine
   100, or hardware may be omitted as required for the
   specific implementation. For example, while buttons or
25 touch screens are typically used in gaming machines to
   allow a player to place a wager and initiate a play of a
   game any input device that enables the player to input
   game play instructions may be used. For example, in some
   gaming machines a mechanical handle is uses to initiate a
30 play of the game.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.

   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
 5 103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                    The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                    The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
10 103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
15 It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
20 Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
25 network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
30 machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
35 The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
                                          10153925_1 (GHMatters) P76814.AU.5 12/04/2018

   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
 5 202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
10 and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.          A loyalty
15 program server 212 may also be provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
20 provides only the player interface.  With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
25 display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
30 client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
35 administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
                                          10153925_1 (GHMatters) P76814.AU.5 12/04/2018

   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
 5 The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
10 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.     For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
15 separate server may be provided.    For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
20 provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   Further Detail of Gaming System
25
   Referring to Figure 6, in the embodiment, the player
   operates game play mechanism 56 to specify their win
   entitlement and whether they want to play the base game or
   purchase direct entry into a feature game triggerable from
30 the base game at a trigger rate   (t).  Game play mechanism
   56provides a series of buttons  (either physical buttons or
   depictions of buttons on a touch screen) that allows the
   player to make the selections. The selections include a
   first class of selection that specifies the player's win
35 entitlement and a second class that indicates whether that
   win entitlement will be evaluated in a base game or a
   feature game and hence whether a initiate base game or
                                             10153925_1 (GHMatters) P76814.AU.5 12/04/2018

                               - 16
   initiate feature game instruction will be communicated
   from the game play mechanism 56 to the game controller 60.
   Parts of the player's selection may be combined in a
   single button. For example, a player's indication that
 5 they want to play five lines may also provide an initiate
   base game instruction to the game controller Depending on
   the embodiment, not all win entitlements available for
   entering the base game may be available when entering the
   feature game. For example, direct entries to the feature
10 game may be restricted to the player choosing to play all
   win lines.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a player's
   win entitlement will vary from game to game and may or may
15 not be dependent on player selections. In most spinning
   reel games, it is typical for the player's entitlement to
   be affected by the amount they wager and selections they
   make  (i.e. the nature of the wager). For example, a
   player's win entitlement may be based on how many lines
20 they will play in each game - i.e. a minimum of one line
   up to the maximum number of lines allowed by the game
   (noting that not all permutations of win lines may be
   available for selection, for example, 1, 5, 10 and 20
   lines may be offered).   Such win lines are typically
25 formed by a combination of displayed symbol positions, one
   from each reel, the symbol positions being located
   relative to one another such that they form a line.
   In many games, the player's win entitlement is not
30 strictly limited to the lines they have selected, for
   example, "scatter" pays are awarded independently of a
   players selection of pay lines and are an inherent part of
   the win entitlement.
35 Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, the player may obtain a win entitlement by
   selecting a number of reels to play. Such games are
                                           10153925_1 (GHMatters) P76814.AU.5 12/04/2018

                              - 17
   marketed under the trade name "Reel Power" by Aristocrat
   Leisure Industries Pty Ltd. The selection of the reel
   means that each displayed symbol of the reel can be
   substituted for a symbol at one or more designated display
 5 positions. In other words, all displayed symbol positions
   of a selected reel can be used to form symbol combinations
   with designated, displayed symbol positions of other
   reels.
10 In other embodiments a player win entitlement may be
   affected by purchasing access to particular pay tables
   e.g. a first bet amount entitles the player to wins
   including cherries and a second amount entitles them to
   wins including plums.
15
   Figure 7 shows a game play mechanism 56 of an embodiment
   where the player selects win lines. Six buttons
   711,712,721,722,731,732 are available to the player A
   player has a choice of whether they will bet 1 credit per
20 line 711 or 5 credits per line. The player completes the
   specification of their win entitlement by selecting one of
   buttons 721,722,731,732 which correspond respectively to
   playing 1 line of the base game, playing 9 lines of the
   base game, playing 1 line of the feature game and playing
25 9 lines of the feature game. Each button 721,722,731,732
   also provides either an initiate base game play
   instruction 721,722 or an initiate feature game
   instruction 731,732 to game controller 60.         In some
   embodiments, the options for direct entry into the feature
30 game may be limited, for example only available if the
   player is playing the maximum base play option, such as
   the maximum number lines.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that typically
35 feature games are triggered occasional or rarely and with
   a prize offering significant return to the player.                       Many
   features require no additional bet. Accordingly, in order
                                          10153925_1 (GHMatters) P76814.AU.5 12/04/2018

                              - 18
   that the gaming system provide the same return to players
   who enter the base game as enter the feature game. This is
   achieved by deducting credits for direct entry into the
   feature game at a multiplier of the amount of credits
 5 required for an equivalent base game based on the relative
   return to player provided by the feature game as described
   in further detail in the accompanying examples. Factors
   used in determining the multiplier, or ante-bet for
   entering the feature game directly include the rate at
10 which the feature triggers, whether a multiplier is
   applied in the feature and whether the feature can be
   retriggered.
   When game controller 60 receives an initiate play
15 instruction, credit controller 624 ensures that the
   correct amount of credits will be deducted in dependence
   on whether the game is to be a base or feature game.
   Usually, the credits are not deducted from the credit
   enter specified by meter data 643 until the play has been
20 completed and the win(s) from the player are known so that
   a nett adjustment of the credit meter may be made.
   Game controller then initiates either base game controller
   622 of feature game controller 623 which implement the
25 base or feature games respectively based on base game data
   642 or feature game data 641. Both controllers 622,623
   employ random number generator 621 to generate game
   outcomes which are evaluated to determined whether an
   award of credits is to be made. If the base game triggers
30 a feature game, base game controller 622 passes control to
   feature game controller 623 to carry out the triggered
   feature game before returning control to base game
   controller 622.
35 The method provided by the embodiment is summarised in
   Figure 8. Initially the game controller 60 waits 810 for
   an initiate play instruction. It determines 820 whether
                                          10153925_1 (GHMatters) P76814.AU.5 12/04/2018

                               - 19
   the initiate play instruction is a base game instruction.
   If it is, a base game is played 840 and it is determined
   850 whether a feature game is triggered. If a feature game
   is triggered, the method involves playing the feature 860
 5 before returning to a waiting 810 state. If a base game is
   not selected at 820, then the instruction will be a
   feature game selection 830 and the feature game is played
   860 via direct entry.
10 Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate that the
   method of the embodiment could be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a computer readable medium, such as a
   disc or a memory  (for example, that could replace part of
15 memory 103) or as a data signal  (for example, by
   downloading it from a server).
   The game can be a spinning reel game, a poker game, a pin
   and ball game, a keno or bingo game, dice game or card
20 game or any other game known in the art. Further the base
   and feature games can be different.
   In the above examples, the player can at any time purchase
   the feature game. If the feature game is already in play,
25 then the commencement of the purchased feature game
   commences at the conclusion of the purchased feature game.
   In an alternative, embodiment one or more rules specify,
   when the feature game is eligible to be purchased, for
   example, the initiate play instruction may need to be in
30 respect of a bet amount per line of a certain value.
   Example 1
   In this example a feature with average pay of 36 times the
35 total bet may be awarded on average once every 100 games
   thus contributing an average of 36% return to player.                             In
   between features the player may play a 54% base with a
                                           10153925_1 (GHMatters) P76814.AU.5 12/04/2018

                                - 20
   total bet per game of 254.     The total return to the player
   is 54% + 36% = 90%.   Thus, on average between each
   feature,
 5 the player spends    100 x 254   =     $25.00
   the player wins      100 x 54% x 254 =        $13.50
   the player loses     100 x  (1 -   54%) x 254 =           $11.50
   The feature of 36 times the bet is a reward of
10
   feature pay     36 x 254  =      $9.00
   Hence the $11.50 lost in the base game buys back a $9.00
   feature, on average.    The net loss of $25 bet - $13.40
15 base win -  $9.00 feature win = $2.50 from $25 bet reflects
   the 90% return to the player.
   Instead of playing 100 base games to get the feature, the
   player may be offered the chance to buy the feature for an
20 appropriate price.   In this case a feature of 36 times the
   normal bet may be offered to the player for 40 times the
   normal bet, the return is unchanged as 36 /             40 = 90%.                    A
   25 line game on a 14 denomination with a feature of 36 x
   total bet can offer a feature for a cost of 40 x 254 =
25 $10.00. That is, the ante bet multiplier, E             =         (Feature
   RTP% *100)/RTP%
   A general expression for the ante bet E as a multiplier of
   the normal bet for this bought feature is as follows:
30
   expected base win (per base game in $)                    B
   expected feature win   (per feature in $)                 F
   trigger rate ( in number of games)                        t
35                             E=
                                   B 1
                                   F   t
                                              10153925_1 (GHMatters) P76814.AU.5 12/04/2018

                               - 21
   Note that the feature win will be in addition to any base
   win in the game from which it is triggered, so that for
   each t games there will be t base games + 1 feature game.
 5 The above expression can be re-written as:          E=         Ft
                                                              Bt+F
   The numerator represents the return that can be expected
   over the number of trigger games if each game if it is
   played as a feature game, whereas the denominator
   represents the return that would normally be expected from
10 that number of games and hence, E represents the ration of
   increased return.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the above
   equations can be applied to both units of currency or
15 units of credits.
   Example 2 -  free games with multiplier
   In games, where there the feature is a series n of free
20 base games. F=nB and if a multiplier m is applied during
   the free games, then F=nMB. So that E= nmt
                                            t+nm
   Example 3 - retriggerable feature
25 In some games, the feature is retriggerable, if the
   trigger occurs during the free games, a retriggerable free
   game feature with
   free games      n

 5
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that, it is
   possible to have multiple features such that the feature
   F 1 , bought with bet Elmay be part      of the underlying game
   or may not.       Further features F 2 , F3 , F4 , ... may be created
10 such that    F 2 occasionally  triggered with ante bet El upon
   buying F1 , but F2 may be bought by a further ante bet E 2
   etc.
   Example 4
15
   The feature game is usually triggered by the occurrence of
   an event. The event can be a game event (e.g. a certain
   set of symbols on a pay line),        a machine event (e.g. a
   random number is selected by the machine),                 a system event
20 or a player tracking system event.
   The feature game usually contributes x% to the total
   return to player. The feature game has a probability of
   occurrence of p      (where O<p<l)
25
   In a spinning reel game with a free game feature, the free
   game feature normally commences when 3 scattered cats
   appear anywhere in the window. The free game feature
   consists of 10 free games playing the lines and bet per
30 line which were in play when the feature was triggered.
   The feature game returns on average 15 times the bet which
   was in play when the feature was triggered. The total
   return to player is 90%.
35 The player is offered the option at any time that the
   feature game is not already in play, to purchase the
                                                   10153925_1 (GHMatters) P76814.AU.5 12/04/2018

                               - 23
   feature game feature.
   The price of the feature game is calculated as 15/.9 = 17
   credits  (with rounding to the nearest credit) multiplied
 5 by the number of lines to be purchased and multiplied by
   the bet per line -  i.e. P=(RR/RTP)*NL*BL, where: P is the
   price in credits; RM is the ratio of the return from the
   feature game to the return from the base game; RTP is the
   average return to player; NL is the number of lines
10 played; and BL is the bet per line.
   The player chooses to purchase 20 lines at 2 credits per
   line, so the cost is 17*2*20=680 credits. The player
   presses the purchase "feature game" button and the credit
15 meter decrements by 680 credits. The player is advised
   that a feature game is now in progress and the feature
   game commences. At the conclusion of the purchased feature
   game, we expect the player to receive 15 * 2* 20 = 600
   credits. This gives an expected player return of 88.2%.
20
   Example 5
   A spinning reel game is provided with 2 types of feature
   games. Feature game A is a hold and re-spin game, feature
25 game B is as per the feature game in example 4 and can be
   purchased in the same manner. In this example, either
   feature game can be purchased at any time provided a
   feature game is not already in play. The total game has a
   return to player of 90%.
30
   Feature game A is a game in which the feature usually
   commences whenever a pair of "wild" symbols occurs on the
   first 2 reels. The first 2 reels are held and the player
   pays the originating bet and the remaining reels are spun.
35 Any win is paid and the player pays the originating bet
   again, the first 2 reels are held and the remaining reels
   are spun. At the conclusion of the 2 re-spins, the game
                                           10153925_1 (GHMatters) P76814.AU.5 12/04/2018

   returns to the usual game. Feature A is expected to return
   10 credits for each credit bet at the time the feature
   commences.
 5 In this game, the player is playing the game and chooses
   to purchase feature game A.   The price for feature game A
   is 10/.9= 11 credits times the total bet (with rounding to
   the nearest credit).
10 The player selects to purchase feature A with 10 lines
   played at 5 credits per line. The credit meter is
   decremented by 550 credits and the player is advised that
   the feature re-spin game is now in play. If necessary, the
   screen and reel strips change and the player sees the
15 reels spin and a pair of "wild" symbols land on the first
   2 reels. Any prize is paid. The player then bets 550
   credits again and the first 2 reels are held and the
   remaining reels are spun. Any prizes are paid. The player
   then bets 550 credits and the first 2 reels are held and
20 the remaining reels are spun. Any prizes are paid.
   It is expected that 10*5*10 = 500 credits will be paid on
   each of the 3 spins. The total return to player is
   500+500+500 for an investment of 3*550. This is a return
25 to player of 90.9%.
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In
30 particular, features of the above embodiments and examples
   can be employed to form further embodiments.
   It is to be understood that, if any prior art publication
   is referred to herein, such reference does not constitute
