FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0003]         The present invention relates to the fields of medical diagnosis, patient
monitoring, treatment efficacy evaluation, nucleic acid and protein delivery, and blood
transfusion.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0004]         Glioblastomas are highly malignant brain tumors with a poor prognosis despite
intensive research and clinical efforts (Louis et al., 2007). The invasive nature of this tumor
makes complete surgical resection impossible and the median survival time is only about 15
months (Stupp et al., 2005). Glioblastoma cells as well as many other tumor cells have a
remarkable ability to mold their stromal environment to their own advantage. Tumor cells
directly alter surrounding normal cells to facilitate tumor cell growth, invasion, chemo
resistance, immune-evasion and metastasis (Mazzocca et al., 2005; Muerkoster et al., 2004;
Singer et al., 2007). The tumor cells also hijack the normal vasculature and stimulate rapid
formation of new blood vessels to supply the tumor with nutrition (Carmeliet and Jain, 2000).
Although the immune system can initially suppress tumor growth, it is often progressively
blunted by tumor activation of immunosuppressive pathways (Gabrilovich, 2007).
[0005]         Small microvesicles shed by cells are known as exosomes (Thery et al., 2002).
Exosomes are reported as having a diameter of approximately 30-100 nm and are shed from
many different cell types under both normal and pathological conditions (Thery et al., 2002).
These microvesicles were first described as a mechanism to discard transferrin-receptors
                                                 1

    WO 2009/100029                                                           PCT/US2009/032881
from the cell surface of maturing reticulocytes (Pan and Johnstone, 1983). Exosomes are
formed through inward budding of endosomal membranes giving rise to intracellular
multivesicular bodies (MVB) that later fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing the
exosomes to the exterior (Thery et al., 2002). However, there is now evidence for a more
direct release of exosomes. Certain cells, such as Jurkat T-cells, are said to shed exosomes
directly by outward budding of the plasma membrane (Booth et al., 2006). All membrane
vesicles shed by cells are referred to herein collectively as microvesicles.
[0006]        Microvesicles in Drosophilamelanogaster,so called argosomes, are said to
contain morphogens such as Wingless protein and to move over large distances through the
imaginal disc epithelium in developing Drosophilamelanogasterembryos (Greco et al.,
2001). Microvesicles found in semen, known as prostasomes, are stated to have a wide range
of functions including the promotion of sperm motility, the stabilization of the acrosome
reaction, the facilitation of immunosuppression and the inhibition of angiogenesis (Delves et
al., 2007). On the other hand, prostasomes released by malignant prostate cells are said to
promote angiogenesis. Microvesicles are said to transfer proteins (Mack et al., 2000) and
recent studies state that microvesicles isolated from different cell lines can also contain
messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) and can transfer mRNA to other cell
types (Baj-Krzyworzeka et al., 2006; Valadi et al., 2007).
[0007]        Microvesicles derived from B-cells and dendritic cells are stated to have potent
immuno-stimulatory and antitumor effects in vivo and have been used as antitumor vaccines
(Chaput et al., 2005). Dendritic cell-derived microvesicles are stated to contain the co
stimulatory proteins necessary for T-cell activation, whereas most tumor cell-derived
microvesicles do not (Wieckowski and Whiteside, 2006). Microvesicles isolated from tumor
cells may act to suppress the immune response and accelerate tumor growth (Clayton et al.,
2007; Liu et al., 2006a). Breast cancer microvesicles may stimulate angiogenesis, and
platelet-derived microvesicles may promote tumor progression and metastasis of lung cancer
cells (Janowska-Wieczorek et al., 2005; Millimaggi et al., 2007).
[0008]        Cancers arise through accumulation of genetic alterations that promote
unrestricted cell growth. It has been stated that each tumor harbors, on average, around 50-80
mutations that are absent in non-tumor cells (Jones et al., 2008; Parsons et al., 2008; Wood et
al., 2007). Current techniques to detect these mutation profiles include the analysis of biopsy
samples and the non-invasive analysis of mutant tumor DNA fragments circulating in bodily
fluids such as blood (Diehl et al., 2008). The former method is invasive, complicated and
                                                2

    WO 2009/100029                                                           PCT/US2009/032881
possibly harmful to subjects. The latter method inherently lacks sensitivity due to the
extremely low copy number of mutant cancer DNA in bodily fluid (Gormally et al., 2007).
Therefore, one challenge facing cancer diagnosis is to develop a diagnostic method that can
detect tumor cells at different stages non-invasively, yet with high sensitivity and specificity.
It has also been stated that gene expression profiles (encoding mRNA or microRNA) can
distinguish cancerous and non-cancerous tissue (Jones et al., 2008; Parsons et al., 2008;
Schetter et al., 2008). However, current diagnostic techniques to detect gene expression
profiles require intrusive biopsy of tissues. Some biopsy procedures cause high risk and are
potentially harmful. Moreover, in a biopsy procedure, tissue samples are taken from a
limited area and may give false positives or false negatives, especially in tumors which are
heterogeneous and/or dispersed within normal tissue. Therefore, a non-intrusive and
sensitive diagnostic method for detecting biomarkers would be highly desirable.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0009]         In general, the invention is a novel method for detecting in a subject the
presence or absence of a variety of biomarkers contained in microvesicles, thereby aiding the
diagnosis, monitoring and evaluation of diseases, other medical conditions, and treatment
efficacy associated with microvesicle biomarkers.
[0010]         One aspect of the invention are methods for aiding in the diagnosis or
monitoring of a disease or other medical condition in a subject, comprising the steps of: a)
isolating a microvesicle fraction from a biological sample from the subject; and b) detecting
the presence or absence of a biomarker within the microvesicle fraction, wherein the
biomarker is associated with the disease or other medical condition. The methods may
further comprise the step or steps of comparing the result of the detection step to a control
(e.g., comparing the amount of one or more biomarkers detected in the sample to one or more
control levels), wherein the subject is diagnosed as having the disease or other medical
condition (e.g., cancer) if there is a measurable difference in the result of the detection step as
compared to a control.
[0011]         Another aspect of the invention is a method for aiding in the evaluation of
treatment efficacy in a subject, comprising the steps of: a) isolating a microvesicle fraction
from a biological sample from the subject; and b) detecting the presence or absence of a
biomarker within the microvesicle fraction, wherein the biomarker is associated with the
treatment efficacy for a disease or other medical condition. The method may further

    WO 2009/100029                                                           PCT/US2009/032881
comprise the step of providing a series of a biological samples over a period of time from the
subject. Additionally, the method may further comprise the step or steps of determining any
measurable change in the results of the detection step (e.g., the amount of one or more
detected biomarkers) in each of the biological samples from the series to thereby evaluate
treatment efficacy for the disease or other medical condition.
[0012]         In certain preferred embodiments of the foregoing aspects of the invention, the
biological sample from the subject is a sample of bodily fluid. Particularly preferred body
fluids are blood and urine.
[0013]         In certain preferred embodiments of the foregoing aspects of the invention, the
methods further comprise the isolation of a selective microvesicle fraction derived from cells
of a specific type (e.g., cancer or tumor cells). Additionally, the selective microvesicle
fraction may consist essentially of urinary microvesicles.
[0014]         In certain embodiments of the foregoing aspects of the invention, the biomarker
associated with a disease or other medical condition is i) a species of nucleic acid; ii) a level
of expression of one or more nucleic acids; iii) a nucleic acid variant; or iv) a combination of
any of the foregoing. Preferred embodiments of such biomarkers include messenger RNA,
microRNA, DNA, single stranded DNA, complementary DNA and noncoding DNA.
[0015]         In certain embodiments of the foregoing aspects of the invention, the disease or
other medical condition is a neoplastic disease or condition (e.g., glioblastoma, pancreatic
cancer, breast cancer, melanoma and colorectal cancer), a metabolic disease or condition
(e.g., diabetes, inflammation, perinatal conditions or a disease or condition associated with
iron metabolism), a post transplantation condition, or a fetal condition.
[0016]         Another aspect of the invention is a method for aiding in the diagnosis or
monitoring of a disease or other medical condition in a subject, comprising the steps of a)
obtaining a biological sample from the subject; and b) determining the concentration of
microvesicles within the biological sample.
[0017]         Yet another aspect of this invention is a method for delivering a nucleic acid or
protein to a target cell in an individual comprising the steps of administering microvesicles
which contain the nucleic acid or protein, or one or more cells that produce such
microvesicles, to the individual such that the microvesicles enter the target cell of the
individual. In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention, microvesicles are
delivered to brain cells.

[0018]         A further aspect of this invention is a method for performing bodily fluid
transfusion (e.g., blood, serum or plasma), comprising the steps of obtaining a fraction of
donor body fluid free of all or substantially all microvesicles, or free of all or substantially all
microvesicles from a particular cell type (e.g., tumor cells), and introducing the microvesicle
free fraction to a patient. A related aspect of this invention is a composition of matter
comprising a sample of body fluid (e.g., blood, serum or plasma) free of all or substantially
all microvesicles, or free of all or substantially all microvesicles from a particular cell type.
[0019]         Another aspect of this invention is a method for performing bodily fluid
transfusion (e.g., blood, serum or plasma), comprising the steps of obtaining a microvesicle
enriched fraction of donor body fluid and introducing the microvesicle-enriched fraction to a
patient. In a preferred embodiment, the fraction is enriched with microvesicles derived from
a particular cell type. A related aspect of this invention is a composition of matter
comprising a sample of bodily fluid (e.g., blood, serum or plasma) enriched with
microvesicles.
[0020]         A further aspect of this invention is a method for aiding in the identification of
new biomarkers associated with a disease or other medical condition, comprising the steps of
obtaining a biological sample from a subject; isolating a microvesicle fraction from the
sample; and detecting within the microvesicle fraction species of nucleic acid; their
respective expression levels or concentrations; nucleic acid variants; or combinations thereof.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0023]         Microvesicles are shed by eukaryotic cells, or budded off of the plasma
membrane, to the exterior of the cell. These membrane vesicles are heterogeneous in size
with diameters ranging from about 10nm to about 5000 nm. The small microvesicles
(approximately 10 to 1000nm, and more often 30 to 200 nm in diameter) that are released by
exocytosis of intracellular multivesicular bodies are referred to in the art as "exosomes". The
methods and compositions described herein are equally applicable to microvesicles of all
sizes; preferably 30 to 800 nm; and more preferably 30 to 200 nm.
[0024]         In some of the literature, the term "exosome" also refers to protein complexes
containing exoribonucleases which are involved in mRNA degradation and the processing of
small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs
(rRNA) (Liu et al., 2006b; van Dijk et al., 2007). Such protein complexes do not have
membranes and are not "microvesicles" or "exosomes" as those terms are used here in.
                       Exosomes As Diagnostic And/Or Prognostic Tools
[0025]         Certain aspects of the present invention are based on the surprising finding that
glioblastoma derived microvesicles can be isolated from the serum of glioblastoma patients.
This is the first discovery of microvesicles derived from cells in the brain, present in a bodily
fluid of a subject. Prior to this discovery it was not known whether glioblastoma cells
produced microvesicles or whether such microvesicles could cross the blood brain barrier
into the rest of the body. These microvesicles were found to contain mutant mRNA
associated with tumor cells. The microvesicles also contained microRNAs (miRNAs) which
                                                 13

    WO 2009/100029                                                         PCT/US2009/032881
were found to be abundant in glioblastomas. Glioblastoma-derived microvesicles were also
found to potently promote angiogenic features in primary human brain microvascular
endothelial cells (HBMVEC) in culture. This angiogenic effect was mediated at least in part
through angiogenic proteins present in the microvesicles. The nucleic acids found within
these microvesicles, as well as other contents of the microvesicles such as angiogenic
proteins, can be used as valuable biomarkers for tumor diagnosis, characterization and
prognosis by providing a genetic profile. Contents within these microvesicles can also be
used to monitor tumor progression over time by analyzing if other mutations are acquired
during tumor progression as well as if the levels of certain mutations are becoming increased
or decreased over time or over a course of treatment
[0026]        Certain aspects of the present invention are based on the finding that
microvesicles are secreted by tumor cells and circulating in bodily fluids. The number of
microvesicles increases as the tumor grows. The concentration of the microvesicles in bodily
fluids is proportional to the corresponding tumor load. The bigger the tumor load, the higher
the concentration of microvesicles in bodily fluids.
[0027]        Certain aspects of the present invention are based on another surprising finding
that most of the extracellular RNAs in bodily fluid of a subject are contained within
microvesicles and thus protected from degradation by ribonucleases. As shown in Example
3, more than 90% of extracellular RNA in total serum can be recovered in microvesicles.
[0028]        One aspect of the present invention relates to methods for detecting, diagnosing,
monitoring, treating or evaluating a disease or other medical condition in a subject by
determining the concentration of microvesicles in a biological sample. The determination
may be performed using the biological sample without first isolating the microvesicles or by
isolating the microvesicles first.
[0029]        Another aspect of the present invention relates to methods for detecting,
diagnosing, monitoring, treating or evaluating a disease or other medical condition in a
subject comprising the steps of, isolating exosomes from a bodily fluid of a subject, and
analyzing one or more nucleic acids contained within the exosomes. The nucleic acids are
analyzed qualitatively and/or quantitatively, and the results are compared to results expected
or obtained for one or more other subjects who have or do not have the disease or other
medical condition. The presence of a difference in microvesicular nucleic acid content of the
subject, as compared to that of one or more other individuals, can indicate the presence or
                                               14

    WO 2009/100029                                                            PCT/US2009/032881
absence of, the progression of (e.g., changes of tumor size and tumor malignancy), or the
susceptibility to a disease or other medical condition in the subject.
[0030]         Indeed, the isolation methods and techniques described herein provide the
following heretofore unrealized advantages: 1) the opportunity to selectively analyze disease
or tumor-specific nucleic acids, which may be realized by isolating disease- or tumor-specific
microvesicles apart from other microvesicles within the fluid sample; 2) significantly higher
yield of nucleic acid species with higher sequence integrity as compared to the yield/integrity
obtained by extracting nucleic acids directly from the fluid sample; 3) scalability, e.g. to
detect nucleic acids expressed at low levels, the sensitivity can be increased by pelleting more
microvesicles from a larger volume of serum; 4) purer nucleic acids in that protein and lipids,
debris from dead cells, and other potential contaminants and PCR inhibitors are excluded
from the microvesicle pellets before the nucleic acid extraction step; and 5) more choices in
nucleic acid extraction methods as microvesicle pellets are of much smaller volume than that
of the starting serum, making it possible to extract nucleic acids from these microvesicle
pellets using small volume column filters.
[0031]         The microvesicles are preferably isolated from a sample taken of a bodily fluid
from a subject. As used herein, a "bodily fluid" refers to a sample of fluid isolated from
anywhere in the body of the subject, preferably a peripheral location, including but not
limited to, for example, blood, plasma, serum, urine, sputum, spinal fluid, pleural fluid,
nipple aspirates, lymph fluid, fluid of the respiratory, intestinal, and genitourinary tracts, tear
fluid, saliva, breast milk, fluid from the lymphatic system, semen, cerebrospinal fluid, intra
organ system fluid, ascitic fluid, tumor cyst fluid, amniotic fluid and combinations thereof.
[0032]         The term "subject" is intended to include all animals shown to or expected to
have microvesicles. In particular embodiments, the subject is a mammal, a human or
nonhuman primate, a dog, a cat, a horse, a cow, other farm animals, or a rodent (e.g. mice,
rats, guinea pig. etc.). The term "subject" and "individual" are used interchangeably herein.
[0033]         Methods of isolating microvesicles from a biological sample are known in the
art. For example, a method of differential centrifugation is described in a paper by Raposo et
al. (Raposo et al., 1996) , and similar methods are detailed in the Examples section herein.
Methods of anion exchange and/or gel permeation chromatography are described in US
Patent Nos. 6,899,863 and 6,812,023. Methods of sucrose density gradients or organelle
electrophoresis are described in U.S. Patent No. 7,198,923. A method of magnetic activated

    WO 2009/100029                                                             PCT/US2009/032881
cell sorting (MACS) is described in (Taylor and Gercel-Taylor, 2008). A method of
nanomembrane ultrafiltration concentrator is described in (Cheruvanky et al., 2007).
Preferably, microvesicles can be identified and isolated from bodily fluid of a subject by a
newly developed microchip technology that uses a unique microfluidic platform to efficiently
and selectively separate tumor derived microvesicles. This technology, as described in a
paper by Nagrath et al. (Nagrath et al., 2007), can be adapted to identify and separate
microvesicles using similar principles of capture and separation as taught in the paper. Each
of the foregoing references is incorporated by reference herein for its teaching of these
methods.
[0034]        In one embodiment, the microvesicles isolated from a bodily fluid are enriched
for those originating from a specific cell type, for example, lung, pancreas, stomach,
intestine, bladder, kidney, ovary, testis, skin, colorectal, breast, prostate, brain, esophagus,
liver, placenta, fetus cells. Because the microvesicles often carry surface molecules such as
antigens from their donor cells, surface molecules may be used to identify, isolate and/or
enrich for microvesicles from a specific donor cell type (Al-Nedawi et al., 2008; Taylor and
Gercel-Taylor, 2008). In this way, microvesicles originating from distinct cell populations
can be analyzed for their nucleic acid content. For example, tumor (malignant and non
malignant) microvesicles carry tumor-associated surface antigens and may be detected,
isolated and/or enriched via these specific tumor-associated surface antigens. In one
example, the surface antigen is epithelial-cell-adhesion-molecule (EpCAM), which is specific
to microvesicles from carcinomas of lung, colorectal, breast, prostate, head and neck, and
hepatic origin, but not of hematological cell origin (Balzar et al., 1999; Went et al., 2004). In
another example, the surface antigen is CD24, which is a glycoprotein specific to urine
microvesicles (Keller et al., 2007). In yet another example, the surface antigen is selected
from a group of molecules CD70, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), EGFR, EGFRvIII and
other variants, Fas ligand, TRAIL, tranferrin receptor, p38.5, p97 and HSP72. Additionally,
tumor specific microvesicles may be characterized by the lack of surface markers, such as
CD80 and CD86.
[0035]        The isolation of microvesicles from specific cell types can be accomplished, for
example, by using antibodies, aptamers, aptamer analogs or molecularly imprinted polymers
specific for a desired surface antigen. In one embodiment, the surface antigen is specific for
a cancer type. In another embodiment, the surface antigen is specific for a cell type which is
not necessarily cancerous. One example of a method of microvesicle separation based on cell
                                                 16

    WO 2009/100029                                                          PCT/US2009/032881
surface antigen is provided in U.S. Patent No. 7,198,923. As described in, e.g., U.S. Patent
Nos. 5,840,867 and 5,582,981, WO/2003/050290 and a publication by Johnson et al.
(Johnson et al., 2008), aptamers and their analogs specifically bind surface molecules and can
be used as a separation tool for retrieving cell type-specific microvesicles. Molecularly
imprinted polymers also specifically recognize surface molecules as described in, e.g., US
Patent Nos. 6,525,154, 7,332,553 and 7,384,589 and a publication by Bossi et al. (Bossi et al.,
2007) and are a tool for retrieving and isolating cell type-specific microvesicles. Each of the
foregoing reference is incorporated herein for its teaching of these methods.
[0036]         It may be beneficial or otherwise desirable to extract the nucleic acid from the
exosomes prior to the analysis. Nucleic acid molecules can be isolated from a microvesicle
using any number of procedures, which are well-known in the art, the particular isolation
procedure chosen being appropriate for the particular biological sample. Examples of
methods for extraction are provided in the Examples section herein. In some instances, with
some techniques, it may also be possible to analyze the nucleic acid without extraction from
the microvesicle.
[0037]         In one embodiment, the extracted nucleic acids, including DNA and/or RNA,
are analyzed directly without an amplification step. Direct analysis may be performed with
different methods including, but not limited to, the nanostring technology. NanoString
technology enables identification and quantification of individual target molecules in a
biological sample by attaching a color coded fluorescent reporter to each target molecule.
This approach is similar to the concept of measuring inventory by scanning barcodes.
Reporters can be made with hundreds or even thousands of different codes allowing for
highly multiplexed analysis. The technology is described in a publication by Geiss et al.
(Geiss et al., 2008) and is incorporated herein by reference for this teaching.
[0038]         In another embodiment, it may be beneficial or otherwise desirable to amplify
the nucleic acid of the microvesicle prior to analyzing it. Methods of nucleic acid
amplification are commonly used and generally known in the art, many examples of which
are described herein. If desired, the amplification can be performed such that it is
quantitative. Quantitative amplification will allow quantitative determination of relative
amounts of the various nucleic acids, to generate a profile as described below.
[0039]         In one embodiment, the extracted nucleic acid is RNA. RNAs are then
preferably reverse-transcribed into complementary DNAs before further amplification. Such
                                                17

reverse transcription may be performed alone or in combination with an amplification step.
One example of a method combining reverse transcription and amplification steps is reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which may be further modified to be
quantitative, e.g., quantitative RT-PCR as described in US Patent No. 5,639,606, which is
incorporated herein by reference for this teaching.
[0040]        Nucleic acid amplification methods include, without limitation, polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) (US Patent No. 5,219,727) and its variants such as in situ polymerase
chain reaction (US Patent No. 5,538,871), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (US Patent
No. 5,219,727), nested polymerase chain reaction (US Patent No. 5,556,773), self sustained
sequence replication and its variants (Guatelli et al., 1990), transcriptional amplification
system and its variants (Kwoh et al., 1989), Qb Replicase and its variants (Miele et al., 1983),
cold-PCR (Li et al., 2008) or any other nucleic acid amplification methods, followed by the
detection of the amplified molecules using techniques well known to those of skill in the art.
Especially useful are those detection schemes designed for the detection of nucleic acid
molecules if such molecules are present in very low numbers. The foregoing references are
incorporated herein for their teachings of these methods.
[0041]        The analysis of nucleic acids present in the microvesicles is quantitative and/or
qualitative. For quantitative analysis, the amounts (expression levels), either relative or
absolute, of specific nucleic acids of interest within the microvesicles are measured with
methods known in the art (described below). For qualitative analysis, the species of specific
nucleic acids of interest within the microvesicles, whether wild type or variants, are identified
with methods known in the art (described below).
[0042]        "Genetic aberrations" is used herein to refer to the nucleic acid amounts as well
as nucleic acid variants within the microvesicles. Specifically, genetic aberrations include,
without limitation, over-expression of a gene (e.g., oncogenes) or a panel of genes, under
expression of a gene (e.g., tumor suppressor genes such as p53 or RB) or a panel of genes,
alternative production of splice variants of a gene or a panel of genes, gene copy number
variants (CNV) (e.g. DNA double minutes) (Hahn, 1993), nucleic acid modifications (e.g.,
methylation, acetylation and phosphorylations), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
chromosomal rearrangements (e.g., inversions, deletions and duplications), and mutations
(insertions, deletions, duplications, missense, nonsense, synonymous or any other nucleotide
changes) of a gene or a panel of genes, which mutations, in many cases, ultimately affect the

activity and function of the gene products, lead to alternative transcriptional splicing variants
and/or changes of gene expression level.
[0043]         The determination of such genetic aberrations can be performed by a variety of
techniques known to the skilled practitioner. For example, expression levels of nucleic acids,
alternative splicing variants, chromosome rearrangement and gene copy numbers can be
determined by microarray analysis (US Patent Nos. 6,913,879, 7,364,848, 7,378,245,
6,893,837 and 6,004,755) and quantitative PCR. Particularly, copy number changes may be
detected with the Illumina Infinium II whole genome genotyping assay or Agilent Human
Genome CGH Microarray (Steemers et al., 2006). Nucleic acid modifications can be assayed
by methods described in, e.g., US Patent No. 7,186,512 and patent publication
WO/2003/023065. Particularly, methylation profiles may be determined by Illumina DNA
Methylation OMA003 Cancer Panel. SNPs and mutations can be detected by hybridization
with allele-specific probes, enzymatic mutation detection, chemical cleavage of mismatched
heteroduplex (Cotton et al., 1988), ribonuclease cleavage of mismatched bases (Myers et al.,
1985), mass spectrometry (US Patent Nos. 6,994,960, 7,074,563, and 7,198,893), nucleic acid
sequencing, single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) (Orita et al., 1989), denaturing
gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)(Fischer and Lerman, 1979a; Fischer and Lerman,
1979b), temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) (Fischer and Lerman, 1979a;
Fischer and Lerman, 1979b), restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) (Kan and

gene expression levels may be determined by the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE)
technique (Velculescu et al., 1995). In general, the methods for analyzing genetic aberrations
are reported in numerous publications, not limited to those cited herein, and are available to
skilled practitioners. The appropriate method of analysis will depend upon the specific goals
of the analysis, the condition/history of the patient, and the specific cancer(s), diseases or
other medical conditions to be detected, monitored or treated. The forgoing references are
incorporated herein for their teachings of these methods.
[0044]         A variety of genetic aberrations have been identified to occur and/or contribute
to the initial generation or progression of cancer. Examples of genes which are commonly
up-regulated (i.e. over-expressed) in cancer are provided in Table 4 (cancers of different
                                                19

types) and Table 6 (pancreatic cancer). Examples of microRNAs which are up-regulated in
brain tumor are provided in Table 8. In one embodiment of the invention, there is an increase
in the nucleic acid expression level of a gene listed in Table 4 and/or Table 6 and/or of a
microRNA listed in Table 8. Examples of genes which are commonly down-regulated (e.g.
under-expressed) in cancer are provided in Table 5 (cancers of different types) and Table 7
(pancreatic cancer). Examples of microRNAs which are down-regulated in brain tumor are
provided in Table 9. In one embodiment of the invention, there is a decrease in the nucleic
acid expression level of a gene listed in Table 5 and/or Table 7 and/or a microRNA listed in
Table 9. Examples of genes which are commonly under expressed, or over expressed in
brain tumors are reviewed in (Furnari et al., 2007) , and this subject matter is incorporated
herein by reference. With respect to the development of brain tumors, RB and p53 are often
down-regulated to otherwise decrease their tumor suppressive activity. Therefore, in these
embodiments, the presence or absence of an increase or decrease in the nucleic acid
expression level of a gene(s) and/or a microRNA(s) whose disregulated expression level is
specific to a type of cancer can be used to indicate the presence or absence of the type of
cancer in the subject.
[0045]         Likewise, nucleic acid variants, e.g., DNA or RNA modifications, single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mutations (e.g., missense, nonsense, insertions,
deletions, duplications) may also be analyzed within microvesicles from bodily fluid of a
subject, including pregnant females where microvesicles derived from the fetus may be in
serum as well as amniotic fluid. Non-limiting examples are provided in Table 3. In yet a
further embodiment, the nucleotide variant is in the EGFR gene. In a still further
embodiment, the nucleotide variant is the EGFRvIII mutation/variant. The terms
"EGFR","epidermal growth factor receptor" and "ErbB 1 "are used interchangeably in the art,
for example as described in a paper by Carpenter (Carpenter, 1987). With respect to the
development of brain tumors, RB, PTEN, p16, p21 and p53 are often mutated to otherwise
decrease their tumor suppressive activity. Examples of specific mutations in specific forms
of brain tumors are discussed in a paper by Furnari et al. (Furnari et al., 2007), and this
subject matter is incorporated herein by reference.
[0046]         In addition, more genetic aberrations associated with cancers have been
identified recently in a few ongoing research projects. For example, the Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) program is exploring a spectrum of genomic changes involved in human
cancers. The results of this project and other similar research efforts are published and
                                                20

    WO 2009/100029                                                           PCT/US2009/032881
incorporated herein by reference (Jones et al., 2008; McLendon et al., 2008; Parsons et al.,
2008; Wood et al., 2007). Specifically, these research projects have identified genetic
aberrations, such as mutations (e.g., missense, nonsense, insertions, deletions and
duplications), gene expression level variations (mRNA or microRNA), copy number
variations and nucleic acid modification (e.g. methylation), in human glioblastoma,
pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and/or colorectal cancer. The genes most frequently mutated
in these cancers are listed in Table 11 and Table 12 (glioblastoma), Table 13 (pancreatic
cancer), Table 14 (breast cancer) and Table 15 (colorectal cancer). The genetic aberrations in
these genes, and in fact any genes which contain any genetic aberrations in a cancer, are
targets that may be selected for use in diagnosing and/or monitoring cancer by the methods
described herein.
[0047]        Detection of one or more nucleotide variants can be accomplished by
performing a nucleotide variant screen on the nucleic acids within the microvesicles. Such a
screen can be as wide or narrow as determined necessary or desirable by the skilled
practitioner. It can be a wide screen (set up to detect all possible nucleotide variants in genes
known to be associated with one or more cancers or disease states). Where one specific
cancer or disease is suspected or known to exist, the screen can be specific to that cancer or
disease. One example is a brain tumor/brain cancer screen (e.g., set up to detect all possible
nucleotide variants in genes associated with various clinically distinct subtypes of brain
cancer or known drug-resistant or drug-sensitive mutations of that cancer).
[0048]        In one embodiment, the analysis is of a profile of the amounts (levels) of
specific nucleic acids present in the microvesicle, herein referred to as a "quantitative nucleic
acid profile" of the microvesicles. In another embodiment, the analysis is of a profile of the
species of specific nucleic acids present in the microvesicles (both wild type as well as
variants), herein referred to as a "nucleic acid species profile." A term used herein to refer to
a combination of these types of profiles is "genetic profile" which refers to the determination
of the presence or absence of nucleotide species, variants and also increases or decreases in
nucleic acid levels.
[0049]        Once generated, these genetic profiles of the microvesicles are compared to
those expected in, or otherwise derived from a healthy normal individual. A profile can be a
genome wide profile (set up to detect all possible expressed genes or DNA sequences). It can
be narrower as well, such as a cancer wide profile (set up to detect all possible genes or
nucleic acids derived therefrom, or known to be associated with one or more cancers).
                                                21

    WO 2009/100029                                                           PCT/US2009/032881
Where one specific cancer is suspected or known to exist, the profile can be specific to that
cancer (e.g., set up to detect all possible genes or nucleic acids derived therefrom, associated
with various clinically distinct subtypes of that cancer or known drug-resistant or sensitive
mutations of that cancer).
[0050]         Which nucleic acids are to be amplified and/or analyzed can be selected by the
skilled practitioner. The entire nucleic acid content of the exosomes or only a subset of
specific nucleic acids which are likely or suspected of being influenced by the presence of a
disease or other medical condition such as cancer, can be amplified and/or analyzed. The
identification of a nucleic acid aberration(s) in the analyzed microvesicle nucleic acid can be
used to diagnose the subject for the presence of a disease such as cancer, hereditary diseases
or viral infection with which that aberration(s) is associated. For instance, analysis for the
presence or absence of one or more nucleic acid variants of a gene specific to a cancer (e.g.
the EGFRvIII mutation) can indicate the cancer's presence in the individual. Alternatively,
or in addition, analysis of nucleic acids for an increase or decrease in nucleic acid levels
specific to a cancer can indicate the presence of the cancer in the individual (e.g., a relative
increase in EGFR nucleic acid, or a relative decrease in a tumor suppressor gene such as
p53).
[0051]         In one embodiment, mutations of a gene which is associated with a disease such
as cancer (e.g. via nucleotide variants, over-expression or under-expression) are detected by
analysis of nucleic acids in microvesicles, which nucleic acids are derived from the genome
itself in the cell of origin or exogenous genes introduced through viruses. The nucleic acid
sequences may be complete or partial, as both are expected to yield useful information in
diagnosis and prognosis of a disease. The sequences may be sense or anti-sense to the actual
gene or transcribed sequences. The skilled practitioner will be able to devise detection
methods for a nucleotide variance from either the sense or anti-sense nucleic acids which may
be present in a microvesicle. Many such methods involve the use of probes which are
specific for the nucleotide sequences which directly flank, or contain the nucleotide
variances. Such probes can be designed by the skilled practitioner given the knowledge of
the gene sequences and the location of the nucleic acid variants within the gene. Such probes
can be used to isolate, amplify, and/or actually hybridize to detect the nucleic acid variants, as
described in the art and herein.
[0052]         Determining the presence or absence of a particular nucleotide variant or
plurality of variants in the nucleic acid within microvesicles from a subject can be performed
                                                22

    WO 2009/100029                                                           PCT/US2009/032881
in a variety of ways. A variety of methods are available for such analysis, including, but not
limited to, PCR, hybridization with allele-specific probes, enzymatic mutation detection,
chemical cleavage of mismatches, mass spectrometry or DNA sequencing, including
minisequencing. In particular embodiments, hybridization with allele specific probes can be
conducted in two formats: 1) allele specific oligonucleotides bound to a solid phase (glass,
silicon, nylon membranes) and the labeled sample in solution, as in many DNA chip
applications, or 2) bound sample (often cloned DNA or PCR amplified DNA) and labeled
oligonucleotides in solution (either allele specific or short so as to allow sequencing by
hybridization). Diagnostic tests may involve a panel of variances, often on a solid support,
which enables the simultaneous determination of more than one variance. In another
embodiment, determining the presence of at least one nucleic acid variance in the
microvesicle nucleic acid entails a haplotyping test. Methods of determining haplotypes are
known to those of skill in the art, as for example, in WO 00/04194.
[0053]        In one embodiment, the determination of the presence or absence of a nucleic
acid variant(s) involves determining the sequence of the variant site or sites (the exact
location within the sequence where the nucleic acid variation from the norm occurs) by
methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), chain terminating DNA sequencing (US
Patent No. 5547859), minisequencing (Fiorentino et al., 2003), oligonucleotide hybridization,
pyrosequencing, Illumina genome analyzer, deep sequencing, mass spectrometry or other
nucleic acid sequence detection methods. Methods for detecting nucleic acid variants are
well known in the art and disclosed in WO 00/04194, incorporated herein by reference. In an
exemplary method, the diagnostic test comprises amplifying a segment of DNA or RNA
(generally after converting the RNA to complementary DNA) spanning one or more known
variants in the desired gene sequence. This amplified segment is then sequenced and/or
subjected to electrophoresis in order to identify nucleotide variants in the amplified segment.
[0054]        In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of screening for nucleotide
variants in the nucleic acid of microvesicles isolated as described herein. This can be
achieved, for example, by PCR or, alternatively, in a ligation chain reaction (LCR) (Abravaya
et al., 1995; Landegren et al., 1988; Nakazawa et al., 1994). LCR can be particularly useful
for detecting point mutations in a gene of interest (Abravaya et al., 1995). The LCR method
comprises the steps of designing degenerate primers for amplifying the target sequence, the
primers corresponding to one or more conserved regions of the nucleic acid corresponding to
the gene of interest, amplifying PCR products with the primers using, as a template, a nucleic
                                               23

    WO 2009/100029                                                          PCT/US2009/032881
acid obtained from a microvesicle, and analyzing the PCR products. Comparison of the PCR
products of the microvesicle nucleic acid to a control sample (either having the nucleotide
variant or not) indicates variants in the microvesicle nucleic acid. The change can be either
an absence or presence of a nucleotide variant in the microvesicle nucleic acid, depending
upon the control.
[0055]        Analysis of amplification products can be performed using any method capable
of separating the amplification products according to their size, including automated and
manual gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and the like.
[0056]        Alternatively, the amplification products can be analyzed based on sequence
differences, using SSCP, DGGE, TGGE, chemical cleavage, OLA, restriction fragment
length polymorphisms as well as hybridization, for example, nucleic acid microarrays.
[0057]        The methods of nucleic acid isolation, amplification and analysis are routine for
one skilled in the art and examples of protocols can be found, for example, in Molecular
Cloning: A LaboratoryManual (3-Volume Set) Ed. Joseph Sambrook, David W. Russel, and
Joe Sambrook, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 3rd edition (January 15, 2001), ISBN:
0879695773. A particular useful protocol source for methods used in PCR amplification is
PCR Basics: From Background to Bench by Springer Verlag; 1st edition (October 15, 2000),
ISBN: 0387916008.
[0058]        Many methods of diagnosis performed on a tumor biopsy sample can be
performed with microvesicles since tumor cells, as well as some normal cells are known to
shed microvesicles into bodily fluid and the genetic aberrations within these microvesicles
reflect those within tumor cells as demonstrated herein. Furthermore, methods of diagnosis
using microvesicles have characteristics that are absent in methods of diagnosis performed
directly on a tumor biopsy sample. For example, one particular advantage of the analysis of
microvesicular nucleic acids, as opposed to other forms of sampling of tumor/cancer nucleic
acid, is the availability for analysis of tumor/cancer nucleic acids derived from all foci of a
tumor or genetically heterogeneous tumors present in an individual. Biopsy samples are
limited in that they provide information only about the specific focus of the tumor from
which the biopsy is obtained. Different tumorous/cancerous foci found within the body, or
even within a single tumor often have different genetic profiles and are not analyzed in a
standard biopsy. However, analysis of the microvesicular nucleic acids from an individual
presumably provides a sampling of all foci within an individual. This provides valuable
                                                 24

    WO 2009/100029                                                           PCT/US2009/032881
information with respect to recommended treatments, treatment effectiveness, disease
prognosis, and analysis of disease recurrence, which cannot be provided by a simple biopsy.
[0059]         Identification of genetic aberrations associated with specific diseases and/or
medical conditions by the methods described herein can also be used for prognosis and
treatment decisions of an individual diagnosed with a disease or other medical condition such
as cancer. Identification of the genetic basis of a disease and/or medical condition provides
useful information guiding the treatment of the disease and/or medical condition. For
example, many forms of chemotherapy have been shown to be more effective on cancers
with specific genetic abnormalities/aberrations. One example is the effectiveness of EGFR
targeting treatments with medicines, such as the kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib.
Such treatment have been shown to be more effective on cancer cells whose EGFR gene
harbors specific nucleotide mutations in the kinase domain of EGFR protein (U.S. Patent
publication 20060147959). In other words, the presence of at least one of the identified
nucleotide variants in the kinase domain of EGFR nucleic acid message indicates that a
patient will likely benefit from treatment with the EGFR-targeting compound gefitinib or
erlotinib. Such nucleotide variants can be identified in nucleic acids present in microvesicles
by the methods described herein, as it has been demonstrated that EGFR transcripts of tumor
origin are isolated from microvesicles in bodily fluid.
[0060]         Genetic aberrations in other genes have also been found to influence the
effectiveness of treatments. As disclosed in the publication by Furnari et al. (Furnari et al.,
2007), mutations in a variety of genes affect the effectiveness of specific medicines used in
chemotherapy for treating brain tumors. The identification of these genetic aberrations in the
nucleic acids within microvesicles will guide the selection of proper treatment plans.
[0061]         As such, aspects of the present invention relate to a method for monitoring
disease (e.g. cancer) progression in a subject, and also to a method for monitoring disease
recurrence in an individual. These methods comprise the steps of isolating microvesicles
from a bodily fluid of an individual, as discussed herein, and analyzing nucleic acid within
the microvesicles as discussed herein (e.g. to create a genetic profile of the microvesicles).
The presence/absence of a certain genetic aberration/profile is used to indicate the
presence/absence of the disease (e.g. cancer) in the subject as discussed herein. The process
is performed periodically over time, and the results reviewed, to monitor the progression or
regression of the disease, or to determine recurrence of the disease. Put another way, a
change in the genetic profile indicates a change in the disease state in the subject. The period
                                                 25

of time to elapse between sampling of microvesicles from the subject, for performance of the
isolation and analysis of the microvesicle, will depend upon the circumstances of the subject,
and is to be determined by the skilled practitioner. Such a method would prove extremely
beneficial when analyzing a nucleic acid from a gene that is associated with the therapy
undergone by the subject. For example, a gene which is targeted by the therapy can be
monitored for the development of mutations which make it resistant to the therapy, upon
which time the therapy can be modified accordingly. The monitored gene may also be one
which indicates specific responsiveness to a specific therapy.
[0062]         Aspects of the present invention also relate to the fact that a variety of non
cancer diseases and/or medical conditions also have genetic links and/or causes, and such
diseases and/or medical conditions can likewise be diagnosed and/or monitored by the
methods described herein. Many such diseases are metabolic, infectious or degenerative in
nature. One such disease is diabetes (e.g. diabetes insipidus) in which the vasopressin type 2
receptor (V2R) is modified. Another such disease is kidney fibrosis in which the genetic
profiles for the genes of collagens, fibronectin and TGF-P are changed. Changes in the
genetic profile due to substance abuse (e.g. a steroid or drug use), viral and/or bacterial
infection, and hereditary disease states can likewise be detected by the methods described
herein.

[0064]         Selection of an individual from whom the microvesicles are isolated is
performed by the skilled practitioner based upon analysis of one or more of a variety of
factors. Such factors for consideration are whether the subject has a family history of a
specific disease (e.g. a cancer), has a genetic predisposition for such a disease, has an
increased risk for such a disease due to family history, genetic predisposition, other disease or
physical symptoms which indicate a predisposition, or environmental reasons. Environmental
reasons include lifestyle, exposure to agents which cause or contribute to the disease such as
in the air, land, water or diet. In addition, having previously had the disease, being currently
diagnosed with the disease prior to therapy or after therapy, being currently treated for the
disease (undergoing therapy), being in remission or recovery from the disease, are other
reasons to select an individual for performing the methods.
[0065]         The methods described herein are optionally performed with the additional step
of selecting a gene or nucleic acid for analysis, prior to the analysis step. This selection can
be based on any predispositions of the subject, or any previous exposures or diagnosis, or
therapeutic treatments experienced or concurrently undergone by the subject.
[0066]         The cancer diagnosed, monitored or otherwise profiled, can be any kind of
cancer. This includes, without limitation, epithelial cell cancers such as lung, ovarian,
cervical, endometrial, breast, brain, colon and prostate cancers. Also included are
gastrointestinal cancer, head and neck cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, cancer of the
nervous system, kidney cancer, retina cancer, skin cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer,
genital-urinary cancer and bladder cancer, melanoma, and leukemia. In addition, the methods
and compositions of the present invention are equally applicable to detection, diagnosis and

prognosis of non-malignant tumors in an individual (e.g. neurofibromas, meningiomas and
schwannomas).
[0067]         In one embodiment, the cancer is brain cancer. Types of brain tumors and cancer
are well known in the art. Glioma is a general name for tumors that arise from the glial
(supportive) tissue of the brain. Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors.
Astrocytomas, ependymomas, oligodendrogliomas, and tumors with mixtures of two or more
cell types, called mixed gliomas, are the most common gliomas. The following are other
common types of brain tumors: Acoustic Neuroma (Neurilemmoma, Schwannoma.
Neurinoma), Adenoma, Astracytoma, Low-Grade Astrocytoma, giant cell astrocytomas, Mid
and High-Grade Astrocytoma, Recurrent tumors, Brain Stem Glioma, Chordoma, Choroid

Neurofibromatosis, Oligodendroglioma. Optic Nerve Glioma, Pineal Region Tumors,
Pituitary Adenoma, PNET (Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor), Spinal Tumors,
Subependymoma, and Tuberous Sclerosis (Bourneville's Disease).
[0068]         In addition to identifying previously known nucleic acid aberrations (as
associated with diseases), the methods of the present invention can be used to identify
previously unidentified nucleic acid sequences/modifications (e.g. post transcriptional
modifications) whose aberrations are associated with a certain disease and/or medical
condition. This is accomplished, for example, by analysis of the nucleic acid within
microvesicles from a bodily fluid of one or more subjects with a given disease/medical
condition (e.g. a clinical type or subtype of cancer) and comparison to the nucleic acid within
microvesicles of one or more subjects without the given disease/medical condition, to
identify differences in their nucleic acid content. The differences may be any genetic
aberrations including, without limitation, expression level of the nucleic acid, alternative
splice variants, gene copy number variants (CNV), modifications of the nucleic acid, single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and mutations (insertions, deletions or single nucleotide
changes) of the nucleic acid. Once a difference in a genetic parameter of a particular nucleic
acid is identified for a certain disease, further studies involving a clinically and statistically
significant number of subjects may be carried out to establish the correlation between the
                                                 28

                                  Exosomes As Delivery Vehicles
[0069]        Aspects of the present invention also relate to the actual microvesicles described
herein. In one embodiment, the invention is an isolated microvesicle as described herein,
isolated from an individual. In one embodiment, the microvesicle is produced by a cell
within the brain of the individual (e.g. a tumor or non-tumor cell). In another embodiment,
the microvesicle is isolated from a bodily fluid of an individual, as described herein.
Methods of isolation are described herein.
[0070]        Another aspect of the invention relates to the finding that isolated microvesicles
from human glioblastoma cells contain mRNAs, miRNAs and angiogenic proteins. Such
glioblastoma microvesicles were taken up by primary human brain endothelial cells, likely
via an endocytotic mechanism, and a reporter protein mRNA incorporated into the
microvesicles was translated in those cells. This indicates that messages delivered by
microvesicles can change the genetic and/or translational profile of a target cell (a cell which
takes up a microvesicle). The microvesicles also contained miRNAs which are known to be
abundant in glioblastomas (Krichevsky et al, manuscript in preparation). Thus microvesicles
derived from glioblastoma tumors function as delivery vehicles for mRNA, miRNA and
proteins which can change the translational state of other cells via delivery of specific mRNA
species, promote angiogenesis of endothelial cells, and stimulate tumor growth.
[0071]        In one embodiment, microvesicles are depleted from a bodily fluid from a donor
subject before said bodily fluid is delivered to a recipient subject. The donor subject may be a
subject with an undetectable tumor and the microvesicles in the bodily fluid are derived from
the tumor. The tumor microvesicles in the donor bodily fluid, if unremoved, would be
harmful since the genetic materials and proteins in the microvesicle may promote unrestricted
growth of cells in the recipient subject.
[0072]        As such, another aspect of the invention is the use of the microvesicles
identified herein to deliver a nucleic acid to a cell. In one embodiment, the cell is within the
body of an individual. The method comprises administering a microvesicle(s) which contains
the nucleic acid, or a cell that produces such microvesicles, to the individual such that the
                                                29

    WO 2009/100029                                                           PCT/US2009/032881
microvesicles contacts and/or enters the cell of the individual. The cell to which the nucleic
acid gets delivered is referred to as the target cell.
[0073]         The microvesicle can be engineered to contain a nucleic acid that it would not
naturally contain (i.e. which is exogenous to the normal content of the microvesicle). This
can be accomplished by physically inserting the nucleic acid into the microvesicles.
Alternatively, a cell (e.g. grown in culture) can be engineered to target one or more specific
nucleic acid into the exosome, and the exosome can be isolated from the cell. Alternatively,
the engineered cell itself can be administered to the individual.
[0074]         In one embodiment, the cell which produces the exosome for administration is
of the same or similar origin or location in the body as the target cell. That is to say, for
delivery of a microvesicle to a brain cell, the cell which produces the microvesicle would be a
brain cell (e.g. a primary cell grown in culture). In another embodiment, the cell which
produces the exosome is of a different cell type than the target cell. In one embodiment, the
cell which produces the exosome is a type that is located proximally in the body to the target
cell.
[0075]         A nucleic acid sequence which can be delivered to a cell via an exosome can be
RNA or DNA, and can be single or double stranded, and can be selected from a group
comprising: nucleic acid encoding a protein of interest, oligonucleotides, nucleic acid
analogues, for example peptide-nucleic acid (PNA), pseudo-complementary PNA (pc-PNA),
locked nucleic acid (LNA) etc. Such nucleic acid sequences include, for example, but are not
limited to, nucleic acid sequences encoding proteins, for example that act as transcriptional
repressors, antisense molecules, ribozymes, small inhibitory nucleic acid sequences, for
example but are not limited to RNAi, shRNA, siRNA, miRNA, antisense oligonucleotides,
and combinations thereof.
[0076]         Microvesicles isolated from a cell type are delivered to a recipient subject. Said
microvesicles may benefit the recipient subject medically. For example, the angiogenesis and
pro-proliferation effects of tumor exosomes may help the regeneration of injured tissues in
the recipient subject. In one embodiment, the delivery means is by bodily fluid transfusion
wherein microvesicles are added into a bodily fluid from a donor subject before said bodily
fluid is delivered to a recipient subject.
[0077]         In another embodiment, the microvesicle is an ingredient (e.g. the active
ingredient in a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation suitable for administration to the
                                                 30

    WO 2009/100029                                                            PCT/US2009/032881
subject (e.g. in the methods described herein). Generally this comprises a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier for the active ingredient. The specific carrier will depend upon a number
of factors (e.g.. the route of administration).
[0078]         The "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" means any pharmaceutically
acceptable means to mix and/or deliver the targeted delivery composition to a subject. This
includes a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or
solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent or encapsulating material, involved in carrying or
transporting the subject agents from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or
portion of the body. Each carrier must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with
the other ingredients of the formulation and is compatible with administration to a subject, for
example a human.
[0079]         Administration to the subject can be either systemic or localized. This includes,
without limitation, dispensing, delivering or applying an active compound (e.g. in a
pharmaceutical formulation) to the subject by any suitable route for delivery of the active
compound to the desired location in the subject, including delivery by either the parenteral or
oral route, intramuscular injection, subcutaneous/intradermal injection, intravenous injection,
buccal administration, transdermal delivery and administration by the rectal, colonic, vaginal,
intranasal or respiratory tract route.

methodologies, protocols and reagents, described herein and as such may vary. The
terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is

EXAMPLES
Examples 1-7. Tumor cells shed microvesicles, which contain RNAs, including mRNAs
and microRNAs, and that microvesicles contain more than 90% of the extracellular
RNA in bodily fluids.
Example 1: Microvesicles are shed from primary human glioblastoma cells.
[0082]        Glioblastoma tissue was obtained from surgical resections and tumor cells were
dissociated and cultured as monolayers. Specifically, brain tumor specimens from patients
diagnosed by a neuropathologist as glioblastoma multiforme were taken directly from surgery
and placed in cold sterile Neurobasal media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The
specimens were dissociated into single cells within 1 hr from the time of surgery using a
Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotech, Berisch Gladbach, Germany) and plated in
DMEM 5% dFBS supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin (10 IU ml-1 and 10 Vg ml-1,
respectively, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). Because microvesicles can be found in
the fetal bovine serum (FBS) traditionally used to cultivate cells, and these microvesicles
contain substantial amounts of mRNA and miRNA, it was important to grow the tumor cells
in media containing microvesicle-depleted FBS (dFBS). Cultured primary cells obtained
from three glioblastoma tumors were found to produce microvesicles at both early and later
passages (a passage is a cellular generation defined by the splitting of cells, which is a
common cell culture technique and is necessary to keep the cells alive). The microvesicles
were able to be detected by scanning electronmicroscopy (FIGS la and 1b) and transmission
electronmicroscopy (FIG If). Briefly, human glioblastoma cells were placed on ornithine
coated cover-slips, fixed in 0.5x Karnovskys fixative and then washed 2x5min (2 times with
5 min each) with PBS. The cells were dehydrated in 35% EtOH 10 min, 50% EtOH 2x 10
min, 70% EtOH 2x 10 min, 95% EtOH 2x 10 min, and 100% EtOH 4 x 10 min. The cells
were then transferred to critical point drying in a Tousimis SAMDR1-795 semi-automatic
Critical Point Dryer followed by coating with chromium in a GATAN Model 681 High
Resolution Ion Beam Coater. As shown in FIGS. la and 1b, tumor cells were covered with
microvesicles varying in size from about 50 - 500 nm.
Example 2: Glioblastoma microvesicles contain RNA.
[0083]        To isolate microvesicles, glioblastoma cells at passage 1-15 were cultured in
microvesicle-free media (DMEM containing 5% dFBS prepared by ultracentrifugation at
110,000 x g for 16 hours to remove bovine microvesicles). The conditioned medium from 40
                                               32

    WO 2009/100029                                                          PCT/US2009/032881
million cells was harvested after 48 hours. The microvesicles were purified by differential
centrifugation. Specifically, glioblastoma conditioned medium was centrifuged for 10 min at
300 x g to eliminate any cell contamination. Supernatants were further centrifuged for 20
min at 16,500 x g and filtered through a 0.22    rm filter. Microvesicles were then pelleted by
ultracentrifugation at 110,000 x g for 70 min. The microvesicle pellets were washed in 13 ml
PBS, pelleted again and resuspended in PBS.
[0084]        Isolated microvesicles were measured for their total protein content using DC
Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
[0085]        For the extraction of RNA from microvesicles, RNase A (Fermentas, Glen
Burnie, MD, USA) at a final concentration of 100 Vg/ml was added to suspensions of
microvesicles and incubated for 15 min at 37 0 C to get rid of RNA outside of the
microvesicles and thus ensure that the extracted RNA would come from inside the
microvesicles. Total RNA was then extracted from the microvesicles using the MirVana
RNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin TX, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
After treatment with DNAse according to the manufacturer's protocol, the total RNA was
quantified using a nanodrop ND-1000 instrument (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Wilmington,
DE, USA).
[0086]        Glioblastoma microvesicles were found to contain RNA and protein in a ratio of
approximately 1:80 (jag RNA:Vg protein). The average yield of proteins and RNAs isolated
from microvesicles over a 48-hour period in culture was around 4 jag protein and 50 ng
RNA/million cells.
[0087]        To confirm that the RNA was contained inside the microvesicles, microvesicles
were either exposed to RNase A or mock treatment before RNA extraction (FIG. Ic). There
was never more than a 7% decrease in RNA content following RNase treatment. Thus, it
appears that almost all of the extracellular RNA from the media is contained within the
microvesicles and is thereby protected from external RNases by the surrounding vesicular
membrane.
[0088]        Total RNA from microvesicles and their donor cells were analyzed with a
Bioanalyzer, showing that the microvesicles contain a broad range of RNA sizes consistent
with a variety of mRNAs and miRNAs, but lack 18S and 28S the ribosomal RNA peaks
characteristic of cellular RNA (FIGS. Id and le).
Example 3: Microvesicles contain DNA.
                                               33

    WO 2009/100029                                                       PCT/US2009/032881
[0089]        To test if microvesicles also contain DNA, exosomes were isolated as
mentioned in Example 2 and then treated with DNase before being lysed to release contents.
The DNase treatment step was to remove DNA outside of the exosomes so that only DNA
residing inside the exosomes was extracted. Specifically, the DNase treatment was
performed using the DNA-free kit from Ambion according to manufacturer's
recommendations (Catalog#AM 1906). For the DNA purification step, an aliquot of isolated
exosomes was lysed in 300I1 lysis buffer that was part of the MirVana RNA isolation kit
(Ambion) and the DNAs were purified from the lysed mixture using a DNA purification kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation.
[0090]        To examine whether the extracted DNA contains common genes, PCRs were
performed using primer pairs specific to GAPDH, Human endogenous retrovirus K,
Tenascin-c and Line-1. For the GAPDH gene, the following primers were used:
Forw3GAPDHnew (SEQ ID NO: 1) and Rev3GAPDHnew (SEQ ID NO: 2). The primer pair
amplifies a 112bp amplicon if the template is a spliced GAPDH cDNA and a 216bp amplicon
if the template is an un-spliced genomic GAPDH DNA. In one experiment, isolated
exosomes were treated with DNase before being lysed for DNA extraction (FIG. 3a). The
112bp fragments were amplified as expected from the exosomes from the tumor serum (See
Lane 4 in FIG. 3a) and the primary tumor cells (See Lane 6 in FIG. 3a) but not from the
exosomes from normal human fibroblasts (See Lane 5 in FIG. 3a). The 216bp fragment
could not be amplified from exosomes of all three origins. However, fragments of both
112bp and 216bp were amplified when the genomic DNA isolated from the glioblastoma cell
was used as templates (See Lane 3 in FIG. 3a). Thus, spliced GAPDH DNA exists within
exosomes isolated from tumor cells but not within exosomes isolated from normal fibroblast
cells.
[0091]        In contrast, in another experiment, isolated exosomes were not treated with
DNase before being lysed for DNA extraction (FIG. 3b). Not only the 112bp fragments but
also the 216bp fragments were amplified from exosomes isolated from primary melanoma
cells (See Lane 3 in FIG. 3b), suggesting that non-spliced GAPDH DNA or partially spliced
cDNA that has been reverse transcribed exists outside of the exosomes.
[0092]        For the Human Endogenous Retrovirus K (HERV-K) gene, the following
primers were used: HERVK_6Forw (SEQ ID NO: 3) and HERVK_6Rev (SEQ ID NO: 4).
The primer pair amplifies a 172bp amplicon. DNA was extracted from exosomes that were
isolated and treated with DNase, and used as the template for PCR amplification. As shown
                                               34

    WO 2009/100029                                                          PCT/US2009/032881
in FIG. 3c, 172bp fragments were amplified in all tumor and normal human serum exosomes
but not in exosomes from normal human fibroblasts. These data suggest that unlike exosomes
from normal human fibroblasts, tumor and normal human serum exosomes contain
endogenous retrovirus DNA sequences. To examine if tumor exosomes also contain
transposable elements, the following LINE-I specific primers were used for PCR
amplifications: LinelForw (SEQ ID NO: 5) and LinelRev (SEQ ID NO: 6). These two
primers are designed to detect LINE-I in all species since each primer contains equal
amounts of two different oligos. For the LinelForw primer, one oligo contains a C and the
other oligo contains a G at the position designated with "s". For the LinelRev primer, one
oligo contains an A and the other oligo contains a G at the position designated with "r". The
primer pair amplifies a 290bp amplicon. The template was the DNA extracted from
exosomes that were treated with DNase (as described above). As shown in FIG. 3e, 290bp
LINE-I fragments could be amplified from the exosomes from tumor cells and normal
human serum but not from exosomes from the normal human fibroblasts.
[0093]        To test if exosomes also contain Tenascin-C DNA, the following primer pair
was used to perform PCR: Tenascin C Forw (SEQ ID NO: 7) and Tenascin C Rev (SEQ ID
NO: 8). The primer pair amplifies a 197bp amplicon. The template was the DNA extracted
from exosomes that were isolated and then treated with DNase before lysis. As shown in
FIG. 3d, 197bp Tenascin C fragments were amplified in exosomes from tumor cells or
normal human serum but not in exosomes from normal human fibroblasts. Thus, Tenascin-C
DNA exists in tumor and normal human serum exosomes but not in exosomes from normal
human fibroblasts.
[0094]        To further confirm the presence of DNA in exosomes, exosomal DNA was
extracted from D425 medulloblastoma cells using the method described above. Specifically,
the exosomes were isolated and treated with DNase before lysis. Equal volumes of the final
DNA extract were either treated with DNase or not treated with DNase before being
visualized by Ethidium Bromide staining in 1% agarose gel. Ethidium Bromide is a dye that
specifically stains nucleic acids and can be visualized under ultraviolet light. As shown in
FIG. 3f, Ethidium Bromide staining disappeared after DNase treatment (See Lane 3 in FIG.
3f) while strong staining could be visualized in the un-treated aliquot (See Lane 2 in FIG. 3f).
The DNase treated and non-treated extracts were also analyzed on a RNA pico chip (Agilent
Technologies). As shown in FIG. 3g, single stranded DNA could be readily detected in the
                                               35

    WO 2009/100029                                                         PCT/US2009/032881
DNase-non-treated extract (See upper panel in FIG. 3g) but could barely be detected in the
DNase-treated extract (See lower panel in FIG. 3g).
[0095]        To test whether the extracted DNA was single-stranded, nucleic acids were
extracted from the treated exosomes as described in the previous paragraph and further
treated with RNAse to eliminate any RNA contamination. The treated nucleic acids were then
analyzed on a RNA pico Bioanalyzer chip and in a DNA 1000 chip. The RNA pico chip only
detects single stranded nucleic acids. The DNA 1000 chip detected double stranded nucleic
acids. As shown in FIG. 3h, single stranded nucleic acids were detected (See upper panel)
but double stranded nucleic acids were not detected (See lower panel). Thus, the DNA
contained within tumor exosomes are mostly single stranded.
[0096]        To demonstrate that single stranded DNA exists in tumor cells but not in normal
human fibroblasts, nucleic acids were extracted from exosomes from either glioblastoma
patient serum or normal human fibroblasts. The exosomes were treated with DNase before
lysis and the purified nucleic acids were treated with RNase before analysis. As shown in
FIG. 3i, exosomal nucleic acids extracted from glioblastoma patient serum could be detected
by a RNA pico chip. In contrast, only a very small amount of single stranded DNA was
extracted from normal human fibroblasts.
[0097]        Accordingly, exosomes from tumor cells and normal human serum were found
to contain contain single-stranded DNA. The single-stranded DNA is a reverse transcription
product since the amplification products do not contain introns (FIG. 3a and FIG. 3b). It is
known that tumor cells as well as normal progenitor cells/stem cells have active reverse
transcriptase (RT) activity although the activity in normal progenitor cells/stem cells is
relatively much lower. This RT activity makes it plausible that RNA transcripts in the cell
can be reverse transcribed and packaged into exosomes as cDNA. Interestingly, exosomes
from tumor cells contain more cDNAs corresponding to tumor-specific gene transcripts since
tumor cells usually have up-regulated reverse transcriptase activity. Therefore, tumor
specific cDNA in exosomes may be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis or prognosis of
different tumor types. The use of cDNAs as biomarkers would skip the step of reverse
transcription compared to the used of mRNA as biomarkers for tumors. In addition, the use
of exosomal cDNA is advantageous over the use of whole serum/plasma DNA because
serum/plasma contains genomic DNA released from dying cells. When testing amplified
whole serum/plasma DNA, there will be more background.

    WO 2009/100029                                                            PCT/US2009/032881
Example 4: Most extracellular RNA in human serum is contained within exosomes.
[0098]         To determine the amount of RNA circulating in serum as "free RNA"/RNA
protein complex versus the amount of RNA contained within the exosomes, we isolated
serum from a healthy human subject, and evenly split the serum into two samples with equal
volume. For sample 1, the serum was ultracentrifuged to remove most microvesicles. Then
the serum supernatant was collected and RNA left in the supernatant was extracted using
Trizol LS. For sample 2, the serum was not ultracentrifuged and total RNA was extracted
from the serum using Trizol LS. The amount of RNA in the sample 1 supernatant and sample
2 serum was measured. As a result, it was found that the amount of free RNA in sample 1
supernatant was less than 10% of the amount of total RNA isolated from the serum sample 2.
Therefore, a majority of the RNA in serum is associated with the exosomes.
Example 5:       High efficiency of serum extracellular nucleic acid extraction is achieved by
                 incorporating a serum exosome isolation step.
[0099]         Whole serum and plasma contain large amounts of circulating DNA and
possibly also RNA protected in protein complexes, while free RNA have a half-life of a few
minutes in serum. Extracellular nucleic acid profiles in serum vary between normal and
diseased mammals and thus may be biomarkers for certain diseases. To examine the profiles,
nucleic acids need to be extracted. However, direct extraction of nucleic acids from serum
and plasma is not practical, especially from large serum/plasma volumes. In this case, large
volumes of Trizol LS (a RNA extraction reagent) are used to instantly inactivate all serum
nucleases before extracting the exosomal nucleic acids. Subsequently, contaminants
precipitate into the sample and affect subsequent analyses. As shown in Example 4, most
extracellular RNAs in serum are contained in serum exosomes. Therefore, we tested whether
it is more efficient to isolate extracellular nucleic acids by isolating the serum exosomes
before nucleic acid extraction.
[00100]        Four milliliter (ml) blood serum from a patient was split into 2 aliquots of 2 ml
each. Serum exosomes from one aliquot were isolated prior to RNA extraction. The methods
of exosome isolation and RNA extraction are the same as mentioned in Example 2. For the
other aliquot, RNA was extracted directly using Trizol LS according to manufacturer's
recommendation. The nucleic acids from these two extractions were analyzed on a
Bioanalyzer RNA chip (Agilent Technologies). As shown in Figure 4, the amount of RNA
extracted with the former method is significantly more than that obtained from the latter
                                                 37

    WO 2009/100029                                                         PCT/US2009/032881
method. Further, the quality of RNA extracted with the latter method is relatively poor
compared to that with the former method. Thus, the step of exosome isolation contributes to
the efficiency of extracellular RNA extraction from serum.
Example 6: Microarray analysis of mRNA.
[00101]       Microarray analysis of the mRNA population in glioblastoma cells and
microvesicles derived from them was performed by Miltenyi Biotech (Auburn, CA, USA)
using the Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarray, 4x44K, two color array. The
microarray analysis was performed on two different RNA preparations from primary
glioblastoma cells and their corresponding microvesicles RNA preparations prepared as
described in Examples 1 and 2. The data was analyzed using the GeneSifter software
(Vizxlabs, Seattle, WA, USA). The Intersector software (Vizxlabs) was used to extract the
genes readily detected on both arrays. The microarray data have been deposited in NCBI's
Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO series accession number
GSE13470.
[00102]       We found approximately 22,000 gene transcripts in the cells and 27,000 gene
transcripts in the microvesicles that were detected well above background levels (99%
confidence interval) on both arrays. Approximately 4,700 different mRNAs were detected
exclusively in microvesicles on both arrays, indicating a selective enrichment process within
the microvesicles. Consistent with this, there was a poor overall correlation in levels of
mRNAs in the microvesicles as compared to their cells of origin from two tumor cell
preparations (FIGS. 2a and 2b). In contrast, there was a good correlation in levels of mRNA
from one cell culture (A) versus the second cell culture (B) (FIG. 2c) and a similar correlation
in levels of mRNA from the corresponding microvesicles (A) and (B) (FIG. 2d).
Accordingly, there is a consistency of mRNA distribution within the tumor cells and
microvesicles. In comparing the ratio of transcripts in the microvesicles versus their cells of
origin, we found 3,426 transcripts differentially distributed more than 5-fold (p-value <0.01).
Of these, 2,238 transcripts were enriched (up to 380 fold) and 1,188 transcripts were less
abundant (up to 90 fold) than in the cells (FIG. 5). The intensities and ratios of all gene
transcripts were documented. The ontologies of mRNA transcripts enriched or reduced more
than 10-fold were recorded and reviewed.
[00103]       The mRNA transcripts that were highly enriched in the microvesicles were not
always the ones that were most abundant in the microvesicles. The most abundant transcripts
                                               38

would be more likely to generate an effect in the recipient cell upon delivery, and therefore
the 500 most abundant mRNA transcripts present in microvesicles were divided into different
biological processes based on their ontology descriptions (FIG. 6a). Of the various
ontologies, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, immune response, cell migration and histone
modification were selected for further study as they represent specific functions that could be
involved in remodeling the tumor stroma and enhancing tumor growth. Glioblastoma
microvesicle mRNAs belonging to these five ontologies were plotted to compare their levels
and contribution to the mRNA spectrum (FIG. 6b). All five ontologies contained mRNAs
with very high expression levels compared to the median signal intensity level of the array.
[00104]       A thorough analysis of mRNAs that are enriched in the microvesicles versus
donor cells, suggests that there may be a cellular mechanism for localizing these messages
into microvesicles, possibly via a "zip code" in the 3'UTR as described for mRNAs
translated in specific cellular locations, such as that for beta actin (Kislauskis et al., 1994).
The conformation of the mRNAs in the microvesicles is not known, but they may be present
as ribonuclear particles (RNPs) (Mallardo et al., 2003) which would then prevent degradation
and premature translation in the donor cell.
[00105]       Microarray analysis of the mRNA populations in glioblastoma cells and
microvesicles derived from glioblastoma cells, melanoma cells, and microvesicles derived
from melanoma cells was performed by Illumina Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA) using the
Whole-Genome cDNA-mediated Annealing, Selection, Extension, and Ligation (DASL)
Assay. The Whole-Genome DASL Assay combines the PCR and labeling steps of Illumina's
DASL Assay with the gene-based hybridization and whole-genome probe set of Illumina's
HumanRef-8 BeadChip. This BeadChip covers more than 24,000 annotated genes derived
from RefSeq (Build 36.2, Release 22). The microarray analysis was performed on two
different RNA preparations from primary glioblastoma cells, microvesicles from
glioblastomas cells (derived with the method as described in Examples 1 and 2), melanoma
cells, and microvesicles from melanoma cells (derived with the method as described in
Examples 1 and 2).
[00106]       The expression data for each RNA preparation were pooled together and used to
generate a cluster diagram. As shown in FIG. 7, mRNA expression profiles for glioblastoma
cells, microvesicles from glioblastomas cells, melanoma cells, and microvesicles from
melanoma cells are clustered together, respectively. Expression profiles of the two primary
glioblastoma cell lines 20/3C and 11/5c are clustered with a distance of about 0.06.

    WO 2009/100029                                                         PCT/US2009/032881
Expression profiles of the two primary melanoma cell lines 0105C and 0664C are clustered
with a distance of about 0.09. Expression profiles of exosomes from the two primary
melanoma cell lines 0105C and 0664C are clustered together with a distance of around 0.15.
Expression profiles of exosomes from the two primary glioblastomas cell lines 20/3C and
11/5c are clustered together with a distance of around 0.098. Thus, exosomes from
glioblastoma and melanoma have distinctive mRNA expression signatures and the gene
expression signature of exosomes differs from that of their original cells. These data
demonstrate that mRNA expression profiles from microvesicles may be used in the methods
described herein for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancers.
Example 7: Glioblastoma microvesicles contain miRNA
[00107]       Mature miRNA from microvesicles and from donor cells was detected using a
quantitative miRNA reverse transcription PCR. Specifically, total RNA was isolated from
microvesicles and from donor cells using the mirVana RNA isolation kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Using the TaqMan@ MicroRNA Assay kits (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 30 ng total RNA was converted into cDNA using
specific miR-primers and further amplified according to the manufacturer's protocol.
[00108]       A subset of 11 miRNAs among those known to be up-regulated and abundant in
gliomas was analyzed in microvesicles purified from two different primary glioblastomas
(GBM 1 and GBM 2). These subset contained let-7a, miR-15b, miR-16, miR-19b, miR-21,
miR-26a, miR-27a, miR-92, miR-93, miR-320 and miR-20.          All of these miRNA were
readily detected in donor cells and in microvesicles (FIG. 8). The levels were generally
lower in microvesicles per ig total RNA than in parental cells (10%, corresponding to
approximately 3 Ct-values), but the levels were well correlated, indicating that these 11
miRNA species are not enriched in microvesicles.
[00109]       Microarray analysis of the microRNA populations in glioblastoma cells and
microvesicles derived from glioblastoma cells, melanoma cells, and microvesicles derived
from melanoma cells was performed by Illumina Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA) using the
MicroRNA Expression Profiling Panel, powered by the DASL Assay. The human MicroRNA
Panels include 1146 microRNA species. The microarray analysis was performed on two
different RNA preparations from primary glioblastoma cells, microvesicles from
glioblastomas cells (derived using the method described in Examples 1 and 2), melanoma

    WO 2009/100029                                                         PCT/US2009/032881
cells, and microvesicles from melanoma cells (derived using the method described in
Examples 1 and 2).
[00110]       The expression data for each RNA preparation were pooled together and used to
generate a cluster diagram. As shown in FIG. 9, microRNA expression profiles for
glioblastoma cells, microvesicles from glioblastomas cells, melanoma cells, and
microvesicles from melanoma cells are clustered together, respectively. Expression profiles
of the two primary melanoma cell lines 0105C and 0664C are clustered with a distance of
about 0.13. Expression profiles of the two primary glioblastomas cell lines 20/3C and 11/5c
are clustered with a distance of about 0.12. Expression profiles of exosomes from the two
primary glioblastomas cell lines 20/3C and 11/5c are clustered together with a distance of
around 0.12. Expression profiles of exosomes from the two primary melanoma cell lines
0105C and 0664C are clustered together with a distance of around 0.17. Thus, exosomes
from glioblastoma and melanoma have distinctive microRNA expression signatures and that
the gene expression signature of exosomes differs from that of their original cells.
Furthermore, as demonstrated herein, microRNA expression profiles from microvesicles may
be used in the methods described herein for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancers.
[00111]       The finding of miRNAs in microvesicles suggests that tumor-derived
microvesicles can modify the surrounding normal cells by changing their
transcriptional/translational profiles. Furthermore, as demonstrated herein, miRNA
expression profile from microvesicles may be used in the methods described herein for the
diagnosis and prognosis of cancers, including but not limited to glioblastoma.
Examples 8-15. These examples show that nucleic acids within exosomes from bodily
fluids can be used as biomarkers for diseases or other medical conditions.
Example 8:      Expression profiles of miRNAs in microvesicles can be used as sensitive
                biomarkers for glioblastoma.
[00112]       To determine if microRNAs within exosomes may be used as biomarkers for a
disease and/or medical condition, we examined the existence of a correlation between the
expression level of microRNA and disease status. Since microRNA-21 is expressed at high
levels in glioblastoma cells and is readily detectable in exosomes isolated from serum of
glioblastoma patients, we measured quantitatively microRNA-21 copy numbers within
exosomes from the sera of glioblastoma patients by quantitative RT-PCR. Specifically,
exosomes were isolated from 4 ml serum samples from 9 normal human subjects and 9
                                               41

    WO 2009/100029                                                            PCT/US2009/032881
glioblastoma patients. The RNA extraction procedure was similar to the RNA extraction
procedure as described in Example 2. The level of miR-21 was analyzed using singleplex
qPCR (Applied Biosystems) and normalized to GAPDH expression level.
[00113]         As shown in FIG. 10, the average Ct-value was 5.98 lower in the glioblastoma
serum sample, suggesting that the exosomal miRNA-21 expression level in glioblastoma
patients is approximately 63 fold higher than that in a normal human subject. The difference
is statistically significant with a p value of 0.01. Therefore, there is a correlation between
microRNA-21 expression level and glioblastoma disease status, which demonstrates that
validity and applicability of the non-invasive diagnostic methods disclosed herein. For
example, in one aspect, the method comprised the steps of isolating exosomes from the
bodily fluid of a subject and analyzing microRNA-21 expression levels within the exosomes
by measuring the copy number of microRNA-21 and comparing the number to that within
exosomes from a normal subject or to a standard number generated by analyzing micro
RNA-21 contents within exosomes from a group of normal subjects. An increased copy
number indicates the existence of glioblastoma in the subject; while the absence of an
increased copy number indicates the absence of glioblastoma in the subject. This basic
method may be extrapolated to diagnose/monitor other diseases and/or medical conditions
associated with other species of microRNAs.
Example 9: mRNAs in microvesicles can be used as sensitive biomarkers for diagnosis
[00114]         Nucleic acids are of high value as biomarkers because of their ability to be
detected with high sensitivity by PCR methods. Accordingly, the following tests were
designed and carried out to determine whether the mRNA in microvesicles could be used as
biomarkers for a medical disease or condition, in this case glioblastoma tumors. The
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mRNA was selected because the expression of the
EGFRvIII mutation is specific to some tumors and defines a clinically distinct subtype of
glioma (Pelloski et al., 2007). In addition, EGFRvIII mutations traditionally cannot be
detected using tissues other than the lesion tissues since these mutations are somatic
mutations but not germ line mutations. Therefore, a biopsy from lesion tissues such as glioma
tumor is conventionally required for detecting EGFRvIII mutations. As detailed below,
nested RT-PCR was used to identify EGFRvIII mRNA in glioma tumor biopsy samples and
the results compared with the mRNA species found in microvesicles purified from a serum
sample from the same patient.
                                                  42

    WO 2009/100029                                                        PCT/US2009/032881
[00115]       Microvesicles were purified from primary human glioblastoma cells followed by
RNA extraction from both the microvesicles and donor cells (biopsy). The samples were
coded and the PCRs were performed in a blind fashion. Gli-36EGFRvIII (human glioma cell
stably expressing EGFRvIII) was included as a positive control. The microvesicles from 0.5
2 ml of frozen serum samples were pelleted as described in Example 2 and the RNA was
extracted using the MirVana Microvesicles RNA isolation kit. Nested RT-PCR was then
used to amplify both the wild type EGFR (1153 bp) and EGFRvIII (352 bp) transcripts from
both the microvesicles and donor cells using the same set of primers. Specifically, the RNA
was converted to cDNA using the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. GAPDH primers were GAPDH
Forward (SEQ ID NO: 9) and GAPDH Reverse (SEQ ID NO: 10). The EGFR/EGFRvIII
PCR1 primers were SEQ ID NO: 11 and SEQ ID NO: 12. The EGFR/EGFRvIII PCR2
primers were SEQ ID NO: 13 and SEQ ID NO: 14. The PCR cycling protocol was 94 'C for
3 minutes; 94 'C for 45 seconds, 60 'C for 45 seconds, 72 'C for 2 minutes for 35 cycles; and
a final step 72 'C for 7 minutes.
[00116]       We analyzed the biopsy sample to determine whether the EGFRvIII mRNA was
present and compared the result with RNA extracted from exosomes purified from a frozen
serum sample from the same patient. Fourteen of the 30 tumor samples (47%) contained the
EGFRvIII transcript, which is consistent with the percentage of glioblastomas found to
contain this mutation in other studies (Nishikawa et al., 2004). EGFRvIII could be amplified
from exosomes in seven of the 25 patients (28%) from whom serum was drawn around the
time of surgery (FIG. 11 and Table 1). When a new pair of primers EGFR/EGFRvIII PCR3:
SEQ ID NO: 15 and SEQ ID NO: 16, were used as the second primer pair for the above
nested PCR amplification, more individuals were found to harbor EGFRvIII mutations (Table
1). EGFRvIII could be amplified from exosomes in the six patients who was identified as
negatives with the old pair of primers EGFRvIII PCR2: SEQ ID NO: 13 AND SEQ ID NO:
14. Notably, exosomes from individual 13, whose biopsy did not show EGFRvIII mutation,
was shown to contain EGFRvIII mutation, suggesting an increased sensivity of EGFRvIII
mutation detection using exosomes technology. From the exosomes isolated from 52 normal
control serum samples, EGFRvIII could not be amplified (FIG. 12). Interestingly, two
patients with an EGFRvIII negative tumor sample turned out to be EGFRvIII positive in the
serum exosomes, supporting heterogeneous foci of EGFRvIII expression in the glioma tumor.
Furthermore, our data also showed that intact RNAs in microvesicles were, unexpectedly,

able to be isolated from frozen bodily serum of glioblastoma patients. These blind serum
samples from confirmed glioblastoma patients were obtained from the Cancer Research
Center (VU medical center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and were kept at -80'C until use.
The identification of tumor specific RNAs in serum microvesicles allows the detection of
somatic mutations which are present in the tumor cells. Such technology should result in
improved diagnosis and therapeutic decisions.
[00117]       The RNA found in the microvesicles contains a "snapshot" of a substantial array
of the cellular gene expression profile at a given time. Among the mRNA found in
glioblastoma-derived microvesicles, the EGFR mRNA is of special interest since the
EGFRvIII splice variant is specifically associated with glioblastomas (Nishikawa et al.,
2004). Here it is demonstrated that brain tumors release microvesicles into the bloodstream
across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), which has not been shown before. It is further
demonstrated that mRNA variants, such as EGFRvIII in brain tumors, are able to be detected
by a method comprising the steps of isolating exosomes from a small amount of patient
serum and analyzing the RNA in said microvesicles.
[00118]       Knowledge of the EGFRvIII mutation in tumors is important in choosing an
optimal treatment regimen. EGFRvIII-positive gliomas are over 50 times more likely to
respond to treatment with EGFR-inhibitors like erlotinib or gefitinib (Mellinghoff et al.,
2005).
Example 10: Diagnosis of iron metabolism disorders
[00119]       The exosome diagnostics method can be adapted for other purposes as shown by
the following example.
[00120]       Hepcidin, an antimicrobial peptide, is the master hormonal regulator of iron
metabolism. This peptide is produced mainly in mammalian liver and is controlled by the
erythropoietic activity of the bone-marrow, the amount of circulating and stored body iron,
and inflammation.     Upon stimulation, hepcidin is secreted into the circulation or urine where
it may act on target ferroportin-expres sing cells. Ferroportin is the sole iron exporter
identified to date and when bound to hepcidin, it is internalized and degraded. The resulting
destruction of ferroportin leads to iron retention in ferroportin expressing cells such as
macrophages and enterocytes. This pathophysiological mechanism underlies anemia of
chronic diseases. More specifically, inappropriately high levels of hepcidin and elevated iron
content within the reticuloendothelial system characterize anemia. Indeed, anemia may be
                                                44

    WO 2009/100029                                                          PCT/US2009/032881
associated with many diseases and/or medical conditions such as infections (acute and
chronic), cancer, autoimmune, chronic rejection after solid-organ transplantation, and chronic
kidney disease and inflammation (Weiss and Goodnough, 2005). On the other hand, in a
genetic iron overload disease such as hereditary hemochromatosis, inappropriately low
expression levels of hepcidin encourage a potentially fatal excessive efflux of iron from
within the reticuloendothelial system. So, hepcidin is up-regulated in anemia associated with
chronic disease, but down-regulated in hemochromatosis.
[00121]        Currently, there is no suitable assay to quantitatively measure hepcidin levels in
circulation or urine (Kemna et al., 2008) except time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF MS),
which needs highly specialized equipment, and therefore is not readily accessible. Recently,
the method of Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) has been proposed to
quantitatively measure hepcidin hormone levels but this method is not consistent because of
the lack of clear correlations with hepcidin (Kemna et al., 2005; Kemna et al., 2007) and
other iron related parameters (Brookes et al., 2005; Roe et al., 2007).
[00122]        Hepcidin mRNA was detected in exosomes from human serum, as follows.
Exosomes were first isolated from human serum and their mRNA contents extracted before
conversion to cDNA and PCR amplification. PCR primers were designed to amplify a 129
nucleotide fragment of human Hepcidin. The sequences of the primers are SEQ ID NO: 57
and SEQ ID NO: 58. A hepcidin transcript of 129 nucleotides (the middle peak in FIG. 13D)
was readily detected by Bioanalyzer. As a positive control (FIG. 13B), RNA from a human
hepatoma cell line Huh-7 was extracted and converted to cDNA. The negative control (FIG.
13C) is without mRNA. These Bioanalyzer data are also shown in the pseudogel in FIG. 13A.
[00123]        Hepcidin mRNA in microvesicles in circulation correlates with hepcidin mRNA
in liver cells. Hence, measuring hepcidin mRNA within microvesicles in a bodily fluid
sample would allow one to diagnose or monitor anemia or hemochromatosis in the subject.
[00124]        Thus, it is possible to diagnose and/or monitor anemia and hemochromatosis in
a subject by isolating microvesicles from a bodily fluid and comparing the hepcidin mRNA in
said microvesicles with the mRNA from from a normal subject. With an anemic subject, the
copy number of mRNA is increased over the normal, non-anemic level. In a subject
suffering from hemochromatosis, the copy number is decreased relative to the mRNA in a
normal subject.

Example 11:      Non-invasive transcriptional profiling of exosomes for diabetic nephropathy
                 diagnosis
[00125]        Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a life threatening complication that currently lacks
specific treatments. Thus, there is a need to develop sensitive diagnostics to identify patients
developing or at risk of developing DN, enabling early intervention and monitoring.
[00126]        Urine analysis provides a way to examine kidney function without having to
take a biopsy. To date, this analysis has been limited to the study of protein in the urine.
This Example sets forth a method to obtain from urine transcriptional profiles derived from
cells that normally could only be obtained by kidney biopsy. Specifically, the method
comprises the steps of isolating urine exosomes and analyzing the RNAs within said
exosomes to obtain transcriptional profiles, which can be used to examine molecular changes
being made by kidney cells in diabetic individuals and provide a 'snap shot' of any new
proteins being made by the kidney. State-of-the-art technologies to obtain exosomal
transcription profiles include, but are not limited to, contemporary hybridization arrays, PCR
based technologies, and next generation sequencing methods. Since direct sequencing does
not require pre-designed primers or spotted DNA oligos, it will provide a non-biased
description of exosomal RNA profiles. An example of next generation sequencing
technology is provided by the Illumina Genome Analyzer, which utilizes massively parallel
sequencing technology which allows it to sequence the equivalent of 1/3 a human genome per
run. The data obtainable from this analysis would enable one to rapidly and comprehensively
examine the urinary exosomal transcriptional profile and allow comparison to the whole
kidney. Using such a method, one could obtain much needed information regarding the
transcription profile of urinary exosomes. A comparison of transcripts in control versus
diabetes-derived urinary exosomes could further provide one with a comprehensive list of
both predicted and new biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy.
[00127]        In order to prove the feasibility of the diagnostic method described above, an
experiment was designed and carried out to isolate urinary exosomes and to confirm the
presence of renal specific biomarkers within these exosomes. In this experiment, a fresh
morning urine sample of 220 ml was collected from a 28-year old healthy male subject and
processed via differential centrifugation to isolate urinary exosomes. Specifically, urine was
first spun at 300 x g spin for 10 minutes to remove any cells from the sample. The
supernatant was collected and then underwent a 20-minute 16,500 x g spin to bring down any
cell debris or protein aggregates. The supernatant was then passed through a 0.22 uM
                                                 46

    WO 2009/100029                                                        PCT/US2009/032881
membrane filter to remove debris with diameters larger than 0.22uM. Finally, the sample
underwent ultra-centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 1 hour to pellet the exosomes (Thery et al.,
2006). The pellet was gently washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and RNA was
extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy kit pursuant to the manufacturer's instructions. The
isolated RNA was converted to cDNA using the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen) followed by
PCR amplification of renal specific genes.
[00128]       The renal specific genes examined and their corresponding renal area where the
gene is expressed are as follows: AQP1 - proximal tubules; AQP2 - distal tubule (principal
cells); CUBN - proximal tubules; LRP2 - proximal tubules; AVPR2 - proximal and distal
tubules; SLC9A3 (NHE-3) - Proximal tubule; ATP6V1B1 - distal tubule (intercalated cells);
NPHS1 - glomerulus (podocyte cells); NPHS2 - glomerulus (podocyte cells); and CLCN3
Type B intercalated cells of collecting ducts. The sequences of the primers designed to
amplify each gene are AQP1-F (SEQ ID NO: 17) and AQP1-R (SEQ ID NO: 18); AQP2-F
(SEQ ID NO: 19) and AQP2-R (SEQ ID NO: 20); CUBN-F (SEQ ID NO: 21) and CUBN-R
(SEQ ID NO: 22); LRP2-F (SEQ ID NO: 23) and LRP2-R (SEQ ID NO: 24); AVPR2-F
(SEQ ID NO: 25) and AVPR2-R (SEQ ID NO: 26); SLC9A3-F (SEQ ID NO: 27) and
SLC9A3-R (SEQ ID NO: 28); ATP6V1B1-F (SEQ ID NO: 29) and ATP6V1B1-R (SEQ ID
NO: 30); NPHS1-F (SEQ ID NO: 31) and NPHS1-R (SEQ ID NO: 32); NPHS2-F (SEQ ID
NO: 33) and NPHS2-R (SEQ ID NO: 34); CLCN5-F (SEQ ID NO: 35) and CLCN5-R (SEQ
ID NO: 36).
[00129]       The expected sizes of the PCR products for each gene are AQP1-226bp, AQP2
208bp, CUBN-285bp, LRP2-220bp, AVPR2-290bp, SLC9A3-200bp, ATP6V1B1-226bp,
NPHS1-201bp, NPHS2-266bp and CLCN5-204bp. The PCR cycling protocol was 95 'C for
8 minutes; 95 'C for 30 seconds, 60 'C for 30 seconds, 72 'C for 45 seconds for 30 cycles;
and a final step 72 'C for 10 minutes.
[00130]       As shown in FIG. 14a, kidney tubule cells contain multivesicular bodies, which
is an intermediate step during exosome generation. Exosomes isolated from these cells can
be identified by electron microscopy (FIG. 14b). Analysis of total RNA extracted from
urinary exosomes indicates the presence of RNA species with a broad range of sizes (FIG.
14c). 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs were not found. PCR analysis confirmed the presence
of renal specific transcripts within urinary exosomes (FIG. 14d). These data show that
kidney cells shed exosomes into urine and these urinary exosomes contain transcripts of renal

    WO 2009/100029                                                        PCT/US2009/032881
origin, and that the exosome method can detect renal biomarkers associated with certain renal
diseases and/or other medical conditions.
[00131]       To further confirm the presence of renal specific mRNA transcripts in urinary
exosomes, an independent set of experiments were performed using urine samples from six
individuals. Exosomal nucleic acids were extracted from 200ml morning urine samples from
each indivisual following a procedure as mentioned above. Specifically, urine samples
underwent differential centrifugation starting with a 1000 xg centrifugation to spin down
whole cells and cell debris. The supernatant was carefully removed and centrifuged at 16,500
xg for 20 minutes. The follow-on supernatant was then removed and filtered through a
0.8pm filter to remove residual debris from the exosome containing supernatant. The final
supernatant then underwent ultracentrifugation at 100,000 xg for 1hr 10min. The pellet was
washed in nuclease free PBS and re-centrifuged at 100,000 xg for 1hr 10min to obtain the
exosomes pellet which is ready for nucleic acid extraction. Nucleic acids were extracted
from the pelleted exosomes using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA Isolation kit and the nucleic
acid concentration and integrity was analyzed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) Pico chip. As
shown in FIG. 14e, nucleic acids isolated from urinary exosomes vary from individual to
individual. To test whether the presence of renal biomarkers also varies from individual to
individual, PCR amplifications were carried out for AquaporinI, Aquaporin2 and Cubilin
gene using a new set of primer pairs: AQP1 new primer pair: SEQ ID NO: 37 and SEQ ID
NO: 38; AQP2 new primer pair: SEQ ID NO: 39 and SEQ ID NO: 40; CUBN new primer
pair: SEQ ID NO: 41 and SEQ ID NO: 42. These primer pairs were designed specifically to
amplify the spliced and reverse transcribed cDNA fragments. Reverse transcription was
performed using the Qiagen Sensiscript kit. As shown in FIG. 14f, no amplification was seen
in individual 1, probably due to failed nucleic acid extraction. AQP1 was amplified only in
individual 2. CUBN was amplified in indivisual 2 and 3. And AQP2 was amplified in
individual 2, 3, 4 and 5. In comparison actin gene (indicated by "House" in FIG. 14f) was
amplified in individual 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. These data provide more evidence that urinary
exosomes contain renal specific mRNA transcripts although the expression levels are
different between different individuals.
[00132]       To test the presence of cDNAs in urinary exosomes, a 200ml human urine
sample was split into two 100ml urine samples. Urinary exosomes were isolated from each
sample. Exosomes from one sample were treated with DNase and those from the other
sample were mock treated. Exosomes from each sample were then lysed for nucleic acid
                                               48

    WO 2009/100029                                                          PCT/US2009/032881
extraction using PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Acturus). The nucleic acids were used as
templates for nested-PCR amplification (PCR protocols described in Example 9) without
prior reverse transcription. The primer pairs to amplify the actin gene were Actin-FOR (SEQ
ID NO: 43) and Actin-REV (SEQ ID NO: 44); Actin-nest-FOR (SEQ ID NO: 45) and Actin
nest-REV (SEQ ID NO: 46) with an expected final amplicon of 100bp based on the actin
gene cDNA sequence. As shown in FIG. 14g, the 100bp fragments were present in the
positive control (human kidney cDNA as templates), DNase treated and non-treated
exosomes, but absent in the negative control lane (without templates). Accordingly, actin
cDNA is present in both the DNase treated and non-treated urinary exosomes.
[00133]       To test whether most nucleic acids extracted using the method were present
within exosomes, the nucleic acids extracted from the DNase treated and non-treated
exosomes were dissolved in equal volumes and analyzed using a RNA Pico chip (Agilent
Technologies). As shown in FIG. 14h, the concentration of the isolated nucleic acids from
the DNase treated sample was 1,131 pg/ul and that from the non-treated sample was 1,378
pg/ul. Thus, more than 80% nucleic acids extracted from urinary exosomes using the above
method were from inside exosomes.
[00134]       To identify the content of urinary exosomes systematically, nucleic acids were
extracted from urinary exosomes and submitted to the Broad Institute for sequencing.
Approximately 14 million sequence reads were generated, each 76 nucleotides in length.
These sequence reads correspond to fragments of DNA/RNA transcripts present within
urinary exosomes. Using an extremely strict alignment parameter (100% identity over full
length sequence), approximately 15% of the reads were aligned to the human genome. This
percentage would likely increase if less stringent alignment criteria was used. A majority of
these 15% reads did not align with protein coding genes but rather with non-coding genomic
elements such are transposons and various LINE & SINE repeat elements. Notably, for those
reads that are not aligned to the human genome, many are aligned to viral sequences. To the
extent that the compositions and levels of nucleic acids contained in urinary exosomes
change with respect to a disease status, profiles of the nucleic acids could be used according
to the present methods as biomarkers for disease diagnosis.
[00135]       This example demonstrates that the exosome method of analyzing urine
exosomes can be used to determine cellular changes in the kidney in diabetes-related kidney
disease without having to take a high-risk, invasive renal biopsy. The method provides a new
and sensitive diagnostic tool using exosomes for early detection of kidney diseases such as
                                               49

    WO 2009/100029                                                             PCT/US2009/032881
diabetic nephropathy. This will allow immediate intervention and treatment. In sum, the
exosome diagnostic method and technology described herein provides a means of much
needed diagnostics for diabetic nephropathy and other diseases which are associated with
certain profiles of nucleic acids contained in urinary exosomes.
Example 12: Prostate cancer diagnosis and urinary exosomes
[00136]        Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men today. The risk of prostate
cancer is approximately 16%. More than 218,000 men in the United States were diagnosed
in 2008. The earlier prostate cancer is detected, the greater are the chances of successful
treatment. According to the American Cancer Society, if prostate cancers are found while
they are still in the prostate itself or nearby areas, the five-year relative survival rate is over
98%.
[00137]        One established diagnostic method is carried out by measuring the level of
prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the blood, combined with a digital rectal examination.
However, both the sensitivity and specificity of the PSA test requires significant
improvement. This low specificity results in a high number of false positives, which generate
numerous unnecessary and expensive biopsies. Other diagnostic methods are carried out by
detecting the genetic profiles of newly identified biomarkers including, but not limited to,
prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) (Groskopf et al., 2006; Nakanishi et al., 2008), a fusion gene
between transmembrane protease serine 2 and ETS-related gene (TMPRSS2-ERG) (Tomlins
et al., 2005), glutathione S-transferase pi (Goessl et al., 2000; Gonzalgo et al., 2004), and
alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase (AMACR) (Zehentner et al., 2006; Zielie et al., 2004) in
prostate cancer cells found in bodily fluids such as serum and urine (Groskopf et al., 2006;
Wright and Lange, 2007). Although these biomarkers may give increased specificity due to
overexpression in prostate cancer cells (e.g., PCA3 expression is increased 60- to 100-fold in
prostate cancer cells), a digital rectal examination is required to milk prostate cells into the
urine just before specimen collection (Nakanishi et al., 2008). Such rectal examinations have
inherent disadvantages such as the bias on collecting those cancer cells that are easily milked
into urine and the involvement of medical doctors which is costly and time consuming.
[00138]        Here, a new method of detecting the genetic profiles of these biomarkers is
proposed to overcome the limitation mentioned above. The method comprises the steps of
isolating exosomes from a bodily fluid and analyzing the nucleic acid from said exosomes.
The procedures of the method are similar to those detailed in Example 9. In this example, the
                                                  50

    WO 2009/100029                                                            PCT/US2009/032881
urine samples were from four diagnosed prostate cancer patients. As shown in FIG. 15c, the
cancer stages were characterized in terms of grade, Gleason stage and PSA levels. In
addition, the nucleic acids analyzed by nested-RT-PCR as detailed in Example 7 were
TMPRSS2-ERG and PCA3, two of the newly identified biomarkers of prostate cancer. For
amplification of TMPRSS2-ERG, the primer pair for the first amplification step was
TMPRSS2-ERG F1 (SEQ ID NO: 47) and TMPRSS2-ERG RI (SEQ ID NO: 48); and the
primer pair for the second amplification step was TMPRSS2-ERG F2 (SEQ ID NO: 49) and
TMPRSS2-ERG R2 (SEQ ID NO: 50). The expected amplicon is 122 base pairs (bp) and
gives two fragments (one is 68 bp, the other is 54 bp) after digestion with the restriction
enzyme HaeII. For amplification of PCA3, the primer pair for the first amplification step
was PCA3 F1 (SEQ ID NO: 51) and PCA3 RI (SEQ ID NO: 52); and the primer pair for the
second amplification step was PCA3 F2 (SEQ ID NO: 53) and PCA3 R2 (SEQ ID NO: 54).
The expected amplicon is 152 bp in length and gives two fragments (one is 90 bp, the other is
62 bp) after digestion with the restriction enzyme Scal.
[00139]        As shown in FIG. 15a, in both patient 1 and 2, but not in patient 3 and 4, the
expected amplicon of TMPRSS2-ERG could be detected and digested into two fragments of
expected sizes. As shown in FIG. 15b, in all four patients, the expected amplicon of PCA3
could be detected and digested into two fragments of expected sizes. Therefore, PCA3
expression could be detected in urine samples from all four patients, while TMPRSS2-ERG
expression could only be detected in urine samples from patient 1 and 2 (FIG. 15c). These
data, although not conclusive due to the small sample size, demonstrate the applicability of
the new method in detecting biomarkers of prostate cancer. Further, the exosome method is
not limited to diagnosis but can be employed for prognosis and/or monitoring other medical
conditions related to prostate cancer.
Example 13: Microvesicles in non-invasive prenatal diagnosis
[00140]        Prenatal diagnosis is now part of established obstetric practice all over the
world. Conventional methods of obtaining fetal tissues for genetic analysis includes
amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, both of which are invasive and confer risk to
the unborn fetus. There is a long-felt need in clinical genetics to develop methods of non
invasive diagnosis. One approach that has been investigated extensively is based on the
discovery of circulating fetal cells in maternal plasma. However, there are a number of
barriers that hinder its application in clinical settings. Such barriers include the scarcity of
fetal cells (only 1.2 cells/ml maternal blood), which requires relatively large volume blood
                                                 51

    WO 2009/100029                                                            PCT/US2009/032881
samples, and the long half life of residual fetal cells from previous pregnancy, which may
cause false positives. Another approach is based on the discovery of fetal DNA in maternal
plasma. Sufficient fetal DNA amounts and short clearance time overcome the barriers
associated with the fetal cell method. Nevertheless, DNA only confers inheritable genetic
and some epigenetic information, both of which may not represent the dynamic gene
expression profiles that are linked to fetal medical conditions. The discovery of circulating
fetal RNA in maternal plasma (Ng et al., 2003b; Wong et al., 2005) may be the method of
choice for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis.
[00141]        Several studies suggest that fetal RNAs are of high diagnostic value. For
example, elevated expression of fetal corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) transcript is
associated with pre-eclampsia (a clinical condition manifested by hypertension, edema and
proteinuria) during pregnancy (Ng et al., 2003a). In addition, the placenta-specific 4
(PLAC4) mRNA in maternal plasma was successfully used in a non-invasive test for
aneuploid pregnancy (such as trisomy 21, Down syndrome) (Lo et al., 2007). Furthermore,
fetal human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) transcript in maternal plasma may be a marker of
gestational trophoblastic diseases (GTDs), which is a tumorous growth of fetal tissues in a
maternal host. Circulating fetal RNAs are mainly of placenta origin (Ng et al., 2003b). These
fetal RNAs can be detected as early as the 4th week of gestation and such RNA is cleared
rapidly postpartum.
[00142]        Prenatal diagnosis using circulating fetal RNAs in maternal plasma,
nevertheless, has several limitations. The first limitation is that circulating fetal RNA is
mixed with circulating maternal RNA and is not effectively separable. Currently, fetal
transcripts are identified, based on an assumption, as those that are detected in pregnant
women antepartum as well as in their infant's cord blood, yet are significantly reduced or
absent in maternal blood within 24 or 36 hours postpartum (Maron et al., 2007). The second
limitation is that no method is established to enrich the circulating fetal RNA for enhanced
diagnostic sensitivity since it is still unknown how fetal RNA is packaged and released. The
way to overcome these limitations may lie in the isolation of microvesicles and the analysis
of the fetal RNAs therein.
[00143]        Several facts suggest that microvesicles, which are shed by eukaryotic cells, are
the vehicles for circulating fetal RNAs in maternal plasma. First, circulating RNAs within
microvesicles are protected from RNase degradation. Second, circulating fetal RNAs have
been shown to remain in the non-cellular fraction of maternal plasma, which is consistent
                                                 52

    WO 2009/100029                                                         PCT/US2009/032881
with the notion that microvesicles encompassing these fetal RNAs are able to be filtered
through 0.22 um membrane. Third, similar to tumorous tissues which are know to shed
microvesicles, placental cells, which are a pseudo-malignant fetal tissue, are most likely
capable of shedding microvesicles. Thus, a novel method of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis
is comprised of isolating fetal microvesicles from maternal blood plasma and then analyzing
the nucleic acids within the microvesicles for any genetic variants associated with certain
diseases and/or other medical conditions.
[00144]       A hypothetical case of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis is as follows: peripheral
blood samples are collected from pregnant women and undergo magnetic activated cell
sorting (MACS) or other affinity purification to isolate and enrich fetus-specific
microvesicles. The microvesicular pellet is resuspended in PBS and used immediately or
stored at -20'C for further processing. RNA is extracted from the isolated microvesicles
using the Qiagen RNA extraction kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. RNA content is
analyzed for the expression level of fetal human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) transcript.
An increased expression level of hCG compared to the standard range points to the
development of gestational trophoblastic diseases (GTDs) and entail further the need for
clinical treatment for this abnormal growth in the fetus. The sensitivity of microvesicle
technology makes it possible to detect the GTDs at a very early stage before any symptomatic
manifestation or structural changes become detectable under ultrasonic examination. The
standard range of hCG transcript levels may be determined by examining a statistically
significant number of circulating fetal RNA samples from normal pregnancies.
[00145]       This prenatal diagnostic method may be extrapolated to the prenatal diagnosis
and/or monitoring of other diseases or medical conditions by examining those transcripts
associated with these diseases or medical conditions. For example, extraction and analysis of
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) nucleic acid from microvesicles of fetus origin from
maternal blood is a non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of neuroblastoma, which is closely
associated with mutations within the kinase domain or elevated expression of ALK (Mosse et
al., 2008). Accordingly, the microvesicle methods and technology described herein may lead
to a new era of much-needed, non-invasive prenatal genetic diagnosis.
Example 14: Melanoma diagnosis
                                               53

    WO 2009/100029                                                        PCT/US2009/032881
[00146]       Melanoma is a malignant tumor of melanocytes (pigment cells) and is found
predominantly in skin. It is a serious form of skin cancer and accounts for 75 percent of all
deaths associated with skin cancer. Somatic activating mutations (e.g. V600E) of BRAF are
the earliest and most common genetic abnormality detected in the genesis of human
melanoma. Activated BRAF promotes melanoma cell cycle progression and/or survival.
[00147]       Currently, the diagnosis of melanoma is made on the basis of physical
examination and excisional biopsy. However, a biopsy can sample only a limited number of
foci within the lesion and may give false positives or false negatives. The exosome method
provides a more accurate means for diagnosing melanoma. As discussed above, the method
is comprised of the steps of isolating exosomes from a bodily fluid of a subject and analyzing
the nucleic acid from said exosomes.
[00148]       To determine whether exosomes shed by melanoma cells contain BRAF mRNA,
we cultured primary melanoma cells in DMEM media supplemented with exosome-depleted
FBS and harvested the exosomes in the media using a similar procedure as detailed in
Example 2. The primary cell lines were Yumel and M34. The Yumel cells do not have the
V600E mutation in BRAF, while M34 cells have the V600E mutation in BRAF. RNAs were
extracted from the exosomes and then analyzed for the presence of BRAF mRNA by RT
PCR. The primers used for PCR amplification were: BRAF forward (SEQ ID NO: 55) and
BRAF reverse (SEQ ID NO: 56). The amplicon is 118 base pairs (bp) long and covers the
part of BRAF cDNA sequence where the V600E mutation is located. As shown in FIG. 16a,
a band of 118 bp was detected in exosomes from primary melanoma cells (Yumel and M34
cells), but not in exosomes from human fibroblast cells or negative controls. The negative
detection of a band of 118 bp PCR product is not due to a mistaken RNA extraction since
GAPDH transcripts could be detected in exosomes from both melanoma cell and human
fibroblast cells (FIG. 16b). The 118 bp PCR products were further sequenced to detect the
V600E mutation. As shown in FIGS. 16c and 16d, PCR products from YUMEL cells, as
expected, contain wild type BRAF mRNA. In contrast, PCR products from M34 cells, as
expected, contain mutant BRAF mRNA with a T-A point mutation, which causes the amino
acid Valine (V) to be replaced by Glutamic acid (E) at the amino acid position 600 of the
BRAF protein. Furthermore, BRAF mRNA cannot be detected in exosomes from normal
human fibroblast cells, suggesting the BRAF mRNA is not contained in exosomes of all
tissue origins.

    WO 2009/100029                                                            PCT/US2009/032881
[00149]        These data suggest that melanoma cells shed exosomes into the blood
circulation and thus melanoma can be diagnosed by isolating these exosomes from blood
serum and analyzing the nucleic acid therefrom for the presence or absence of mutations
(e.g., V600E) in BRAF. The method described above can also be employed to diagnose
melanomas that are associated with other BRAF mutations and mutations in other genes. The
method can also be employed to diagnose melanomas that are associated with the expression
profiles of BRAF and other nucleic acids.
Example 15:      Detection of MMP levels from exosomes to monitor post transplantation
                 conditions.
[00150]        Organ transplants are usually effective treatments for organ failures. Kidney
failure, heart disease, end-stage lung disease and cirrhosis of the liver are all conditions that
can be effectively treated by a transplant. However, organ rejections caused by post
transplantation complications are major obstacles for long-term survival of the allograft
recipients. For example, in lung transplantations, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is a
severe complication affecting survival rates. In kidney transplants, chronic allograft
nephropathy remains one of the major causes of renal allograft failure. Ischemia-reperfusion
injury damages the donor heart after heart transplantation, as well as the donor liver after
orthotopic liver transplantation. These post-transplantation complications may be
ameliorated once detected at early stages. Therefore, it is essential to monitor post
transplantation conditions in order to alleviate adverse complications.
[00151]        Alterations in the extracellular matrix contribute to the interstitial remodeling in
post-transplantation complications. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in both
the turnover and degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. MMPs are a family of
proteolytic, zinc-dependent enzymes, with 27 members described to date, displaying
multidomain structures and substrate specificities, and functioning in the processing,
activation, or deactivation of a variety of soluble factors. Serum MMP levels may indicate
the status of post-transplantation conditions. Indeed, circulating MMP-2 is associated with
cystatin C, post-transplant duration, and diabetes mellitus in kidney transplant recipients
(Chang et al., 2008). Disproportional expression of MMP-9 is linked to the development of
bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after lung transplantation (Hubner et al., 2005).
[00152]        MMP mRNAs (MMP1, 8, 12, 15, 20, 21, 24, 26 and 27) can be detected in
exosomes shed by glioblastoma cells as shown in Example 4 and Table 10. The present
                                                 55

   WO 2009/100029                                                          PCT/US2009/032881
exosome method, isolating exosomes from a bodily fluid and analyzing nucleic acids from
said exosomes, can be used to monitor transplantation conditions. The exosome isolation
procedure is similar to that detailed in Example 2. The present procedures to analyze nucleic
acid contained within exosomes are detailed in Example 9. A significant increase in the
expression level of MMP-2 after kidney transplantation will indicate the onset and/or
deterioration of post-transplantation complications. Similarly, a significantly elevated level
of MMP-9 after lung transplantation, suggests the onset and/or deterioration of bronchiolitis
obliterans syndrome.
[00153]       Therefore, the exosome method can be used to monitor post-transplantation
conditions by determining the expression levels of MMP proteins associated with post
transplantation complications. It is also expected that the method can be extrapolated to
monitor post-transplantation conditions by determining the expression of other marker genes
as well as monitor other medical conditions by determining the genetic profile of nucleic
acids associated with these medical conditions.
Examples 16-18. Microvesicles can be therapeutic agents or delivery vehicles of
therapeutic agents.
Example 16:     Microvesicle proteins induce angiogenesis in vitro.
[00154]       A study was designed and carried out to demonstrate glioblastoma microvesicles
contribute to angiogenesis. HBMVECs (30,000 cells), a brain endothelial cell line, (Cell
Systems, Catalogue #ACBRI-376, Kirkland, WA, USA) were cultured on Matrigel-coated
wells in a 24-well plate in basal medium only (EBM) (Lonza Biologics Inc., Portsmouth, NH,
USA), basal medium supplemented with glioblastoma microvesicles (EBM+ MV) (7
pg/well), or basal medium supplemented with a cocktail of angiogenic factors (EGM;
hydrocortisone, EGF, FGF, VEGF, IGF, ascorbic acid, FBS, and heparin; Singlequots (EBM
positive control). Tubule formation was measured after 16 hours and analyzed with the
Image J software. HBMVECs cultured in the presence of glioblastoma microvesicles
demonstrated a doubling of tubule length within 1 6 hours. The result was comparable to the
result obtained with HBMCECs cultured in the presence of angiogenic factors (FIG. 18a).
These results show that glioblastoma-derived microvesicles play a role in initiating
angiogenesis in brain endothelial cells.
[00155]       Levels of angiogenic proteins in microvesicles were also analyzed and
compared with levels in glioblastoma donor cells. Using a human angiogenesis antibody
                                              56

    WO 2009/100029                                                        PCT/US2009/032881
array, we were able to detect 19 proteins involved in angiogenesis. Specifically, total protein
from either primary glioblastoma cells or purified microvesicles isolated from said cells were
lysed in lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and added to the human angiogenesis
antibody array (Panomics, Fremont CA, USA) according to manufacturer's
recommendations. The arrays were scanned and analyzed with the Image J software. As
shown in FIG. 18b, of the seven of the 19 angiogenic proteins were readily detected in the
microvesicles, 6 (angiogenin, IL-6, 1L-8, TIMP-I, VEGF and TIMP-2) were present at higher
levels on a total protein basis as compared to the glioblastoma cells (FIG. 18c). The three
angiogenic proteins most enriched in microvesicles compared to tumor cells were angiogenin,
IL-6 and 1L-8, all of which have been implicated in glioma angiogenesis with higher levels
associated with increased malignancy (25-27).
[00156]       Microvesicles isolated from primary glioblastoma cells were also found to
promote proliferation of a human U87 glioma cell line. In these studies, 100 000 U87 cells
were seeded in wells of a 24-well plate and allowed to grow for three days (DMEM-5%FBS)
or DMEM-5%FBS supplemented with 125 Vg microvesicles isolated from primary
glioblastoma cells. After three days, untreated U87 cells (FIG. 19a) were found to be fewer
in number as determined using a Burker chamber, than those supplemented with
microvesicles (FIG. 19b). Both non-supplemented and supplemented U87 cells had
increased 5-and 8-fold in number over this period, respectively (FIG. 19c). Thus,
glioblastoma microvesicles appear to stimulate proliferation of other glioma cells.
Example 17: Glioblastoma microvesicles are taken up by HBMVECs.
[00157]       To demonstrate that glioblastoma microvesicles are able to be taken up by
human brain microvesicular endothelial cells (HBMVECs), purified glioblastoma
microvesicles were labeled with PKH67 Green Fluorescent labeling kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO, USA). The labeled microvesicles were incubated with HBMVEC in culture (5
Vg/50,000 cells) for 20 min at 4'C. The cells were washed and incubated at 37 0 C for 1 hour.
Within 30 min the PKH67-labeled microvesicles were internalized into endosome-like
structures within the HBMVECs (FIG. 17a). These results show that glioblastoma
microvesicles can be internalized by brain endothelial cells.
[00158]       Similar results were obtained when adding the fluorescently labeled
microvesicles to primary glioblastoma cells.

Example 18: mRNA delivered by glioblastoma microvesicles can be translated in recipient
cells.
[00159]       To determine whether glioblastoma-derived microvesicles mRNA could be
delivered to and expressed in recipient cells, primary human glioblastoma cells were infected
with a self-inactivating lentivirus vector expressing secreted Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) using a
CMV promoter at an infection efficiency of >95%. The cells were stably transduced and
generated microvesicles during the subsequent passages (2-10 passages were analyzed).
Microvesicles were isolated from the cells and purified as described above. RT-PCR
analysis showed that the mRNA for Gluc (555 bp) as well as GAPDH (226 bp) were present
in the microvesicles (FIG. 17b). The level of Gluc mRNA was even higher than that for
GAPDH as evaluated with quantitative RT-PCR.
[00160]       Fifty micrograms of the purified microvesicles were added to 50,000 HBMVE
cells and incubated for 24 hrs. The Gluc activity in the supernatant was measured directly
after microvesicle addition (0 hrs), and after 15 hrs and 24 hrs. The Gluc activity in the
supernatant was normalized to the Gluc protein activity associated with the microvesicles.
The results are presented as the mean ± SEM (n=4). Specifically, the activity in the recipient
HBMVE cells demonstrated a continual translation of the microvesicular Gluc mRNA. Thus,
mRNA incorporated into the tumor microvesicles can be delivered into recipient cells and
generate a functional protein.
[00161]       The statistical analyses in all examples were performed using the Student's t
test.

Table 1. RNA in glioblastoma microvesicles can be used as sensitive biomarkers.
Nested RT-PCR was used to monitor EGFRvIII mRNA in glioma biopsy tissue as well as
exosomes purified from a frozen serum sample from the same patient. Samples from 30
patients were analysed in a blinded fashion and PCR reactions were repeated at least three
times for each sample. No EGFRvIII mRNA was found in serum microvesicles from 30
normal controls. PPI refers to primer pair composed of SEQ ID NOs: 13 and 14. PP2 refers
to primer pair composed of SEQ ID NOS: 15 and 16. "-" refers to "not available".
