   Cross-Reference to Related Applications
 5
   This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/815,549, filed
   April 24, 2013, which application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
   The disclosure of the complete specification of Australian Patent Application No.
10 2014257660, as originally filed and as amended, is incorporated herein by reference.
   Field of the Invention
   The present invention relates to an optical fiber distribution system, including a rack,
15 and elements which populate the rack, including fiber terminations, patching, fiber
   splitters, and fiber splices.
   Background of the Invention
20 Optical fiber distribution systems include fiber terminations and other equipment which
   is typically rack mounted.      Various concerns exist for the optical fiber distribution
   systems, including density, ease of use, and cable management. There is a continuing
   need for improvements in the optical fiber distribution area.
25 Summary of the Invention
   One implementation of a system in accordance with the examples of the disclosure
   includes a building block element mountable to a rack or other structure. The element
                                                1

   includes a chassis and a movable tray. The tray is movably mounted to chassis with a
   slide mechanism that allows the tray to slide relative to the chassis.          The slide
   mechanism includes a synchronized movement feature for managing the cables
   extending to and from the tray, such that cable pull at the entry and exit locations is
 5 reduced or eliminated as the tray is moved.
   One synchronized movement feature includes gears, including a rack and pinion
   system. Another synchronized movement feature includes wheels and wires.
10 The tray preferably includes mounting structures for holding cable terminations,
   splitters, and/or splices.   One mounting structure includes an open shaped frame
   member for connector access. In one example, two frame members are provided, one
   positioned over the other.     For improved access, the frame members are hingedly
   mounted to the tray. In a termination arrangement, the adapters are arranged so that the
15 connector axes are horizontal and extend in a perpendicular direction to the direction of
   travel for the tray.
   Each frame member can be populated with adapter blocks. Pathways guide cables to
   the adapter ports of the adapter blocks for fiber optic cables terminated with connectors
20 to be received therein. The cables follow a general S-shaped pathway from a side of
   each element to the adapter blocks. The S-shaped pathway includes two levels inside of
   the tray to segregate cables between the two frame members.          Various flanges and
   radius limiters can be provided to assist with cable management.
25 The elements can be stacked in a column with each tray mounted horizontally, or used
   in a group or block mounted vertically. In the case of a column of elements, a selected
   tray is pulled outward to access the desired tray, and then the frame members on the
   tray can be pivoted as needed.
                                                2

   One side of each element can be for patch cables, and the opposite side can be for cable
   termination of an incoming cable, such as a distribution cable or a feeder cable.
   Because of the synchronized movement feature, cables can be secured along the sides of
   the elements and still allow for sliding movement of the trays without a need for large
 5 amounts or any cable slack.
   The tray and the frame members allow for easy top and bottom access to connectors on
   either side of the adapters. Openings are provided in the tray bottom for hand access if
   desired.
10
   The cable mounts for the distribution cables or feeder cables can be snap mounted to the
   elements and/or mounted in a longitudinal slide mount, and include strength member
   clamps and cable clamps.
15 Groupings of loose cables can be managed with cable wraps or other cable guides such
   as flexible troughs.
   The elements can be configured as desired and form building blocks for an optical fiber
   distribution system (ODF).
20
   When the elements are mounted in a column in a rack, the cables can be placed in
   vertical cable guides to enter and exit the selected element.
   The example rack is front accessible, however, the elements can be used in other racks,
25 frames, cabinets or boxes including in arrangements where rear access is desirable or
   useful.
   According to another aspect, the disclosure is directed to a universal mounting
   mechanism       configured   for   mounting      a  telecommunications   chassis  to   a
30 telecommunications fixture, the mounting mechanism comprising a mounting bracket
                                                 3

   defining a rear portion configured for mounting to the telecommunications fixture and a
   front portion configured to slidably receive the telecommunications chassis, the front
   portion including a latch opening, a locking spring configured to be mounted to the
   telecommunications chassis, the locking spring defining a portion configured to flex
 5 laterally to snap in to the latch opening, a release handle configured to be slidably
   mounted to the telecommunications chassis, the release handle defining a deflection tab
   for moving the locking spring out of the latch opening of the mounting bracket when
   the release handle is slid along a rearward to forward direction with respect to the
   telecommunications      chassis, and a     cover  configured   to be mounted      to the
10 telecommunications chassis, the cover defining a deflection ramp configured to interact
   with the deflection tab of the release handle for moving the deflection tab laterally to
   contact the locking spring when the release handle is slid with respect to the
   telecommunications chassis.
15 According to another aspect, the disclosure is directed to a telecommunications system
   that includes the universal mounting bracket mounted between the telecommunications
   chassis and the telecommunications fixture.
   According to yet another aspect, the disclosure is directed to a method of releasably
20 mounting a telecommunications chassis to a telecommunications rack.          The method
   comprises mounting a mounting bracket to the telecommunications fixture, the
   mounting bracket defining a front portion including a latch opening, sliding the front
   portion of the mounting bracket into a bracket channel defined on at least one side of
   the telecommunications chassis, laterally flexing a locking spring to snap-fit at least a
25 portion of the locking spring into the latch opening, and pulling a release handle on the
   telecommunications chassis along a rearward to forward direction to deflect the locking
   spring out of the latch opening.

   Detailed Description
   Referring now to Figures 1-16, various embodiments of an optical fiber distribution
   element 10, or element 10, are shown. The elements 10 can be individually mounted as
15 desired to telecommunications equipment including racks, frames, or cabinets.      The
   elements 10 can be mounted in groups or blocks 12 which form a stacked arrangement.
   In one embodiment, a vertical stack of elements 10 populates an optical fiber
   distribution rack.
20 Each element 10 holds fiber terminations, or other fiber components including fiber
   splitters and/or fiber splices.  In the case of fiber terminations, incoming cables are
   connected to outgoing cables through connectorized cable ends which are connected by
   adapters, as will be described below.
25 Each element includes a chassis 20 and a movable tray 24. Tray 24 is movable with a
   slide mechanism 30 including one or more gears 32 and a set of two toothed racks or
   linear members 34.
   Slide mechanism 30 provides for synchronized movement for managing the cables
30 extending to and from tray 24. Entry points 36 on either side of chassis 20 allow for
                                                7

   fixation of the input and output cables associated with each element 10.      The radius
   limiters 38 associated with each slide mechanism 30 move in synchronized movement
   relative to chassis 20 and tray 24 to maintain fiber slack, without causing fibers to be
   bent, pinched, or pulled.
 5
   Each tray 24 includes mounting structure 50 defining one or more fiber terminations,
   fiber splitters, fiber splices, or other fiber components. As shown, mounting structure
   50 holds adapters 52 which allow for interconnection of two connectorized ends of
   cables. Each tray 24 includes one or more frame members 56. In the example shown,
10 two frame members 56 are provided.            As illustrated, each frame member 56 is T
   shaped.     Also, each tray 24 includes two frame members 56 which are hingedly
   mounted at hinges 58. A top frame member 62 is positioned above a bottom frame
   member 64. The mounting structure 50 associated with each frame member 62, 64
   includes one or more integrally formed adapter blocks 70. Adapter blocks 70 include a
15 plurality of adapter ports for interconnecting to fiber optic connectors. A pathway 76
   defines a generally S-shape from radius limiters 38 to adapter blocks 70. As shown,
   pathway 76 includes an upper level 78 and a lower level 80 in the interior. A portion 84
   of pathway 76 is positioned adjacent to hinges 58 to avoid potentially damaging cable
   pull during pivoting movement of frame members 56. Flanges 86 and radius limiters 90
20 help maintain cables in pathways 76.
   Tray 24 includes openings 96 to allow for technician access to the cable terminations at
   adapter blocks 70. In addition, the T-shapes of frame members 56 further facilitate
   technician access to the connectors.
25
   Cables extending to and from element 10 can be affixed with a cable mount 100 as
   desired. Additional protection of the fiber breakouts can be handled with cable wraps
    102. Radius limiters 106 can be additionally used to support and protect the cables.
                                                  8

   Referring now to Figures 17-29, various examples of cable routings are illustrated for
   element 10.
   If desired, more than one feeder cable can supply cabling to more than one element 10.
 5
   Referring now to Figures 30-41, various additional embodiments of elements 210 are
   shown. Element 210 includes a chassis 220 in a movable tray 224 mounted with a slide
   mechanism 230 which promotes synchronized movement of radius limiters 238. Each
   tray 224 includes two hingedly mounted frame members 256. Each frame member 256
10 has a middle portion 260 separated by openings 262 from side portions 264. Middle
   portion 260 can hold fiber terminations. Side portions 264 include radius limiters 270.
   Cover 266 goes over tray 224. Latches 268 latch tray 224 to cover 266 in the closed
   position.
15 A pathway 276 extends from either side of tray 224 to supply cables to each of trays
   224. An upper level 278 and a lower level 280 supply the respective frame members
   256 with cabling. A general S-shaped pathway 276 is defined wherein the pathway 276
   passes close to hinges 258.
20 A dovetail 288 is used to hold cable mounts 286 and radius limiters 284.
   An opening 290 in tray 224 allows for connector access by the technician. Similarly,
   openings 262 on each frame member 256 allow for technician access to the individual
   connectors.
25
   To form a block 292 of plural elements 210, bars 294 and fasteners 296 are used. Bars
   294 give a small spacing between each element 210.
   Referring now to Figures 42-45, an alternative slide mechanism 330 is shown in
30 alternative element 310. Slide mechanism 330 allows for movement of the trays and
                                               9

   related radius limiters and synchronized movement similar to slide mechanism 30, 230.
   Alternative slide mechanism 330 includes two wheels 332 and two wires 334, 336. The
   wheels 332 are located on second part 342. The wires are looped in opposite directions
   and are connected to the first part 340 and the third part 344.
 5
   Referring now to Figures 46 and 47, an alternative radius limiter 420 is shown on
   alternative element 410. Radius limiter 420 includes friction members 430 which limit
   the amount of sliding movement of cables passing through radius limiter 420, to assist
   with cable management.       Friction members 430 include flexible fingers which press
10 lightly on the cables in radius limiter 420 to reduce or eliminate sliding movement of
   the cables in the radius limiter 420.
   Referring now to Figures 48-52, a universal mounting mechanism 500 for releasably
   mounting a telecommunications chassis to a telecommunications fixture, such as an
15 optical fiber distribution rack, is illustrated. In Figures 48-52, the universal mounting
   mechanism 500 is shown as having been adapted for and being used on an optical fiber
   distribution element 510 having features similar to those elements 210, 410 shown in
   Figures 30-47 of the present disclosure. With the universal mounting mechanism 500
   of Figures 48-52, telecommunications chassis or elements such as elements 210, 410,
20 and 510 can be mounted as desired to telecommunications fixtures or equipment such as
   racks, frames, or cabinets.
   It should be noted that although the universal mounting mechanism 500 of the present
   disclosure has been shown as being used on a piece of telecommunications equipment
25 such as the optical fiber distribution element 510 (which has similar features to those
   elements 210 and 410 of Figures 30-47), the optical fiber distribution element 510 is
   simply one example of telecommunications equipment or chassis on which the
   mounting mechanism 500 may be used for mounting to equipment such as
   telecommunications racks, frames, or cabinets.       For use with the universal mounting
30 mechanism 500 of Figures 48-52, the element 510 has been adapted to receive certain
                                                  10

   portions of the mounting mechanism 500. However, it should be understood that the
   mounting mechanism 500 of the present disclosure includes features having inventive
   aspects in isolation and can be used on other types of optical fiber distribution elements
   as long as the elements or chassis thereof are adapted to receive portions of the
 5 mounting mechanism 500.
   Still referring to Figures 48-52, the universal mounting mechanism 500 will now be
   described in further detail.
10 Figure 48 shows a cross-sectional view of a portion of the universal mounting
   mechanism 500, wherein the mounting mechanism 500 is in a locked state or position.
   Figure 49 illustrates the universal mounting mechanism 500 in an unlocked position.
   Figure 50 illustrates a partially exploded perspective view of a portion of the universal
   mounting mechanism 500 being used with the optical fiber distribution element 510,
15 which is similar to the elements 210, 410 shown in Figures 30-47, as noted above.
   Figure 51 illustrates the universal mounting mechanism 500 with the universal
   mounting brackets 502 of the mechanism 500 mounted to the element 510. Figure 51A
   is a close-up view of a portion of the universal mounting mechanism 500, illustrating a
   locking spring 504 of the mechanism 500 in a locked position with respect to the
20 universal mounting bracket 502 of the mechanism 500. Figure 52 is a cross-sectional
   view of a portion of the universal mounting mechanism 500 showing the positional
   relationship between the universal mounting bracket 502 and a release handle 506 of the
   mounting mechanism 500 when the mechanism 500 is in a locked state.
25 The universal mounting mechanism 500 generally includes the right and left universal
   mounting brackets 502, release handles 506 for each of the mounting brackets 502, a
   cover 508 for each of the mounting brackets 502, and the locking spring 504 for each of
   the mounting brackets 502.
                                               11

   In the depicted embodiment, each of the universal mounting brackets 502 is designed
   for mounting two stacked elements 510.        Thus, each of the right and left mounting
   brackets 502 includes two latch openings 512 adjacent the front 514 of the mounting
   bracket 502 (one for each element 510) and upper and lower mounting tabs 516 at the
 5 rear 518 of the bracket 502.
   In the given embodiment, the mounting tabs 516 at the rear 518 of the mounting
   brackets 502 are designed to slidably mount the brackets 502 to fixtures such as
   telecommunications racks along a sideway or lateral direction. As such, in mounting
10 elements 510 to a rack, the universal mounting brackets 502 are initially slid into
   openings provided on the rack using the mounting tabs 516. Once the brackets 502 are
   secured on a rack, the elements 510 can be slid onto the brackets 502 in a sliding
   fashion, as will be described in further detail. The latch openings 512 of the brackets
   502 are then used to lock the elements 510 in place.
15
   In using the universal mounting mechanism 500 of the present disclosure, each element
   510, on each of the right and left sides thereof, defines a bracket channel 520. The
   channel 520 is configured to slidably receive the front portions 514 of the mounting
   brackets 502.    The cover 508 closes the bracket channel 520 to the exterior of each
20 element 510. The cover 508 defines a deflection ramp 522 at the inner face thereof, the
   purpose of which will be discussed in further detail below. The locking spring 504 is
   mounted to each element 510 such that an end portion 524 of the locking spring 504 can
   flex in and out of the latch opening 512 of the universal mounting bracket 502. As
   shown in the cross-sectional views of Figures 48 and 49 and in Figures 51 and 51A, the
25 end portion 524 of the locking spring 504 defines a perpendicular locking face 526 and
   an angular insertion face 528. When an element 510 is initially being slidably mounted
   on the mounting bracket 502, the angled insertion face 528 rides over the front end 530
   of the front portion 514 of the mounting bracket 502 until the end portion 524 of the
   locking spring 504 flexibly snaps into the latch opening 512.
30
                                               12

   The element 510, at this point, is prevented from being pulled out forwardly.        The
   locking spring 504 abuts an inner front face 532 defined by the latch opening 512 of the
   mounting bracket 502 to prevent removal of the chassis from a rack.
 5 The release handle 506 is positioned between the locking spring 504 and the cover 508.
   The release handle 506 has a grip portion 534 for pulling the release handle 504
   forwardly to release the chassis for removal from the mounting brackets 502.          The
   release handle 504 also defines a deflection tab 536 at the rear end 538. The deflection
   tab 536 is configured to ride over the deflection ramp 522 of the cover 508 when the
10 grip portion 534 is pulled forwardly. The interaction of the deflection tab 536 and the
   deflection ramp 522 causes lateral inward movement of the deflection tab 536, which in
   turn, pushes the spring 504 laterally inwardly, clearing the end portion 524 of the
   locking spring 504 from the latching opening 512. In this manner, when the release
   handle 506 is pulled forwardly, the interaction of the deflection tab 536 and the
15 deflection ramp 522 causes the release of the spring 504, and thus the entire element
   510, from the mounting bracket 502. The chassis and the entire element 510 can be
   pulled forwardly from the mounting bracket 502.
   In using the universal mounting mechanism 500 on the element 510, a tray of the
20 element 510 has to be pulled from its chassis to allow enough room for gripping the
   release handle 506 as seen in Figure 52, to pull it forwardly. In initially mounting the
   element 510 to a rack using the universal mounting mechanism 500, the release handle
   506 has to be either pushed rearwardly by the user to allow the spring 504 to be
   positioned in its locking position or the user can simply push a tray of the element 510
25 rearwardly to contact the grip portion 534 of the release handle 506 to push the release
   handle 506 rearwardly. Thus, when the element 510 is mounted to a rack using the
   universal mounting mechanism 500, the release handle 506 must be in its rearward
   position to allow the spring 504 to be in its locking position. Otherwise, if the release
   handle 506 is in its forward position, the element 510 can simply slide out of the
30 brackets 502.
                                               13

   The release handle 506 defines a positive stop 540 that is configured to abut a stop face
   542 defined by a portion of a slide mechanism 544 within the element 510.               The
   abutment of the stop 540 with the stop face 542 prevents further forward pulling of the
 5 release handle 506.
   The universal mounting mechanism 500 includes a design that may be retrofitted on a
   number of telecommunications chassis. As long as a bracket channel 520 is provided in
   the chassis and the chassis includes enough spacing on the sides thereof for receiving a
10 locking spring 504, a release handle 506, and a cover 508 for interacting with the
   release handle 506 and closing the mounting mechanism 500 to the exterior of the
   chassis, the universal mounting mechanism 500 can be utilized on a given chassis.
   Also, as noted above, the rear portion 518 of the mounting brackets 502 may be
15 modified to fit different types of mounting configurations on different types of
   telecommunications racks, frames, or cabinets.        The mounting arrangement of the
   brackets 502 of the present disclosure that utilizes the tabs 516 for lateral slide-locking
   is simply one example of a mounting arrangement.         Also, even though the mounting
   mechanism 500 of the present disclosure has been shown with mounting brackets 502
20 that can accommodate two vertically stacked elements 510, the mounting brackets 502
   can be modified to receive other number of chassis, including a single chassis per
   bracket 502.
   In the given embodiment, the locking spring 504 is fixed to the chassis with fasteners
25 545, allowing the end portion 524 of the locking spring 504 to be flexible. Other fixing
   methods may be used for the locking spring 504 in other types of telecommunications
   equipment.
