                    Pipe Fitting, Pipe System & associated Method
Technical Field
[001]    The invention relates to a pipe fitting, a piping system and method, in
particular, the method relates to using a coloured indicia applied to pipe fittings and
an associated method to match a particular size of pipe fitting with an matching pipe
size.
Background
[002]   Pipe fittings are commonly used to connect pipes. Pipe fittings and the pipes to
which they connect may be made from brass, stainless steel, other metals and also
plastics. One type of piping is formed from a cross-linked polyethylene, commonly
referred to as a "PEX" material. These types of PEX pipes are commonly connected
using a pipe fitting having an internal bore and a ribbed end that is fitted into the PEX
pipe. A metal crimp or sleeve is used to compress and secure PEX pipe onto the
ribbed end of the pipe fitting. In use, a fluid, typically water or gas, flows from the
PEX pipe through the internal bore of the fitting.
[003]   A problem with these pipe fittings relates to the use of an incorrectly sized
pipe being fitted with a fitting (or vice versa) that may result in the fitting and pipe
becoming dissociated causing leakage and safety problems. Moreover, if an
incorrectly sized tool is used on wrong fittings for the size pipe being crimped or
compressed then the tools used to join the fitting and pipe, such as crimping jaws,
may become damaged.
[004]    The invention disclosed herein seeks to overcome one or more of the above
identified problems or at least provide a useful alternative.

Detailed Description
[0023] Referring to Figures 1 to 4b, there is shown a fitting 10 for connecting with
one or more pipes, such as cross-linked polyethylene "PEX" pipes 11, using a crimp
to compress the one or more PEX pipes onto the fitting 10. It is noted that the fitting
10 shown herein is a straight fitting. However, the fitting 10 may be provided in other
forms such as, but not limited to, elbows, reducing fittings, loose nut elbows, male
lugged elbows etc.
[0024] The fitting 10 includes an elongate body 12 having opposing open ends 14, an
intermediate section 16 and first and second portions 18, 20 extending from either
side of the intermediate section 16 toward respective ones of the opposing open ends
14. The elongate body 12 including an internal bore 13 extending between the open
ends 14. At least one of the opposing ends 14 is arranged to be received by and fit
with the pipe 11 of a predetermined size. The fitting includes indicia 21 configured to
associate the fitting with the one or more pipes of predetermined sizes.
[0025] In this example, one of the opposing ends 14, more specifically the first
portion 18, includes a plurality of annular ridges 22 extending from outer surfaces 24
thereof for fitting within the pipe 11 and the other of the opposing ends 14 include a

                                            -5
coupling 26 and nut 28 to connect with another complimentary threaded fitting.
However, of course, many variations of the pipe fitting ends 14 are possible.
[0026] In this example, the intermediate portion 16 includes an intermediate annular
ridge 27 provided by the nut 28. The intermediate annular ridge 27 stands proud of the
plurality of annular ridges 22 so as to a provide a backing 30 for a plastic isolating
washer or collar 34 and a spacer between adjacently fitted one or more pipes.
[0027] In this example, the indicia 21 may be provided on or by the plastic isolating
washer or collar 34. For example, the isolating washer or collar 34 may be coloured
such as being green, blue, orange etc and this colour may form part of or be associated
with a colour code linked to a predetermined size of pipe via a lookup table such as
Table 1 below. However, it is noted that the indicia 21 may also be, but not limited to,
a symbol, marking, or letter. In some example, a coloured or multi coloured marking
may be directly painted or applied to the fitting 10. Table 1 may be physical table or
digital table 30 displayable on a screen (not shown).

Table 1: Example Colour Code Table
[0028] The pipe fitting 10 may be provided as part of a system 100 that includes one
or more of the pipe fittings 10, one or more of the pipes 11 and the look up table 30.
The system 100 may also further include a crimping collar 40, and the crimping collar
40 in some examples may include further likewise indicia 42 such as, but not limited
to a colour marking, to associate a particular sized collar 40 with the appropriate pipe
fitting 10 and pipe 11. It is noted that the pipe 11 itself may also include an indicia 13
to correspond with that the of fitting 11 and collar 42

                                            -6
[0029] In use, a method of fitting the pipe fitting 10 with the pipe 11 may include the
following steps: inspecting the indicia 21 of the pipe fitting 10. Comparing the indicia
21 to the lookup table 30 to identify the size of the fitting 10 and determine a correctly
sized associated pipe 11. Selecting the pipe fitting 10, pipe 11 and a collar 40.
Connecting the pipe fitting 10 and the associated pipe by fitting the crimping collar 40
over the associated pipe 11, inserting a hollow end 14 of the fitting 10 into the
associated pipe 11, and crimping the crimp 40, typically with the crimping tool 44 to
secure the pipe 11 and the associated fitting 10.
[0030] In some examples, the method further includes the step of: inspecting indicia
42 of crimping collar 40 to ensure the size of the crimping collar 40 is correctly
associated with the pipe fitting 10 and associated pipe 11.
[0031] Advantageously, there has been described a pipe fitting, system and method
that allows the size of the fitting, pipe and collar to be easily selected and matched
with one another thereby reducing errors, damage to fittings or tools, and saving
labour time as a result of sizing mismatching.

requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" and
"comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or
group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of
integers or steps.

publication is not, and should not be taken to be, an acknowledgment or admission or
suggestion that the known matter or prior art publication forms part of the common
general knowledge in the field to which this specification relates.
