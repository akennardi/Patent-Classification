10       1-(2,6-dimethoxy)-2-acetone       is  mainly     used  as   an   intermediate    for
   anti-arrhythmias and mexiletine drug synthesis intermediates. Most of the existing
   synthesis    methods    are    using   the  process     that hydroxypropylated    by    2,
   6-dimethylphenol and epoxy propane under the influence of the sodium hydroxide,
   producing (2,6-dimethylphenol) isopropyl alcohol. It is oxidized with sulphuric and
15 sodium dichromate to generate the product. This method of production requires
   sodium dichromate and sulfuric acid solution as the reactant, it has highly risk during
   the reaction process, sodium dichromate solution makes environmental pollution, and
   the process is more complicated. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new synthetic
   method.
