Technical Field
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a drill chuck guard. In particular, the present
invention relates to a drill chuck guard for use in underground drilling such as roof drilling in
mining applications.
Background of the Invention
[0002] Various types of rock anchors are used in mining and civil applications to stabilise a
geological formation to reduce the risk of collapse. In recent years, in the coal mining
industry, there has been a trend towards the use of cable anchors in place of conventional
rigid bolts. A cable anchor may be in the form of a multi-wire tendon, a single strand of
cables or a number of strands.
[0003] In order to prepare the roof for the cable bolt insertion, a hole must firstly be drilled
into the coal strata, and the drilling process is known to suffer from several problems.
[0004] During drilling, the height of the mine from floor to ceiling is typically around 3.2
metres and this dimension dictates the maximum length of drill string which can be used. In
practice, up to 8 or 10 drill string steels may be required to achieve the desired drilling
depth. In this way, drill strings are interconnected end to end to achieve increased drill
depths, until the required drill depth is reached.
[0005] In order to achieve the extension of the drill string, the drill steels each have a
threaded, male leading end, and a female trailing end, having a corresponding internal
thread. Once a first drill steel has been drilled, and is located in the coal strata, the leading
end of a second drill steel can be secured to the trailing end of the first drill steel. The
second drill steel is then mounted to the drill chuck, and drilling continues until the second
drill steel is also in the strata. The process can be continued as many times as necessary to
achieve the desired total length of steels for a given hole depth.
[0006] Typically in order to conduct the drilling process, a short drive bit is inserted into the
chuck of a mobile bolter. In one common arrangement, the drive bit has a base having a
square cross-sectional profile which is seated inside a corresponding square recess in the
chuck. Such a square drive arrangement enables the chuck to rotate the drive bit without
requiring tightening or loosening of the chuck.

                                                   3
[0007] The leading end of the drive bit has a male threaded projection which corresponds
with the size of the female threaded portion at the trailing end of each drill steel.
[0008] Once the drilling process is completed, the drill steels may be removed if required
so that a cable anchor or other such fastener can be inserted into the hole to secure the
mine roof.
[0009] One significant drawback associated with the interconnection of the drill steels
concerns the risk of the steels rupturing or splitting at the trailing end, due to the thinner
wall thickness of the drill steels in the vicinity of the female threaded portion. If the trailing
end of the drill string splits, the operator of the mobile roof bolter could be injured or even
killed.
[0010] A further problem with the above described roof drilling process concerns possible
snapping or torsional failure of the drill steel. Again, this is likely to occur near the trailing
end, due to the thinner wall thickness of the drill steel in the vicinity of the female threaded
portion.
[0011] The risk of failure of the drill steel dictates that the drilling process can not normally
be conducted within certain predetermined distances in respect of certain pieces of
infrastructure such as high tension cables, which may be undesirable.
Object of the Invention
[0012] It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least
ameliorate one or more of the above disadvantages, or to provide a useful alternative.
Summary of the Invention
[0013] In a first aspect, the present invention provides a drill chuck guard comprising:
          a body portion having a proximal end and a distal end, an aperture located at the
proximal end being configured to receive a drill chuck into an internal receptacle; and
          a stem extending away from the body portion distal end, the stem having a central
void configured to be located on a rotational axis of the drill chuck;
          wherein a distal end of the stem includes an opening configured to receive a drill
steel.
[0014] The stem preferably includes at least one lateral liquid egression hole.

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments
[0036] A drill chuck guard 10 is disclosed herein. The chuck guard 10 is used with drilling
equipment such as underground mobile bolters. However, it will be appreciated by those
skilled in the art that the chuck guard 10 may be used with other drilling equipment.
[0037] The drill chuck guard 10 includes a body 20 having a proximal end 25 and a distal
end 27. As shown in Fig. 1, the distal end 27 is tapered, and has a frusto-conical profile. The
body 20 is machined from mild steel or another suitable engineering material such as
stainless steel, aluminium or an engineering polymer.
[0038] The body 20 is generally tubular, and defines an internal receptacle 30 which is
adapted to receive and house a drill chuck (not shown) of the mobile bolter or other drilling
machine. The drill chuck is inserted into the receptacle 30 through an aperture 40 formed in
the base of the body 20, at the proximal end 25.
[0039] The drill chuck guard 10 includes a stem or sheath 50. The stem 50 is tubular and is
secured to a leading end of the body 20. The stem 50 has a central void 60 which is
contiguous with the receptacle 30. At least one slot 70 is formed in the side wall of the stem
50. Preferably there are several such slots 70 formed along the length of the stem 50. The
slots 70 provide a fluid flow passage which enables water or other cutting fluids to exit from
within the void. As such, during drilling, water or other cutting fluid which runs down the drill
steel is able to exit through the slots 70 along with any debris. In addition, the slots 70
provides the drill operator with visual reference within the void 60 if required.

                                                6
[0040] A leading end 80 of the receptacle 30 defines a bearing seat surface 80. The
bearing seat surface 80 is used to seat a rubber seal washer or gasket or O-ring 90. The
gasket or O-ring 90 may be seated on a dedicated annular groove or other formation formed
in the bearing surface 80. Alternatively, the gasket or O-ring 90 may be held in the desired
location due to the structure of the leading end 80 of the receptacle 30 and the internal side
wall of the receptacle 30.
[0041] The gasket or O-ring 90 provides a barrier between the drill chuck and the leading
end 80 of the receptacle 30. This reduces wear of the metal components of the chuck, and
reduces noise.
[0042] The stem 50 may be secured to the body 20 by welding. Alternatively, the stem 50
may be fitted to the body 20 with corresponding male and female threaded portions. In an
alternative embodiment, the stem 50 and the body 20 may be integrally formed, for example
by die casting.
[0043] Referring to Fig. 1, the body 20 includes a restriction formation 100 configured to
adjust the size of the aperture 40. Furthermore, the aperture 40 may include a retainer ring
42 in the form of an annular insert which locally reduces the size of the receptacle 30. The
retainer ring 42 may be permanently fitted to the aperture 40, for example by welding.
Alternatively, the retainer ring 42 may be removable.
[0044] The restriction formation 100 may include screws or other such fasteners 110 which
extend through the wall of the body 20 radially inwardly. The screws of fasteners 110 are
configured to then abut against the chuck, or a shaft located beneath and connected to the
chuck. In this manner, the restriction formation 100 is intended to secure the drill chuck
guard 10 relative to the chuck. Accordingly, the drill chuck guard 10 when secured rotates
with the chuck, and at the same rotational speed as the chuck. However, the drill chuck
guard 10 may alternatively be rotationally free relative to the chuck.
[0045] In one embodiment, the restriction formation 100 may be provided in the form of
one or more ball bearings seated on a spring, such as a ball spring plunger, or ball bearing
loaded set screws. The restriction formation 100 is intended to prevent or at least inhibit the
drill chuck guard 10 from being unintentionally removed from the chuck.
[0046] Referring to Fig. 2, a bottom view of the drill chuck guard 10 is depicted. In this
embodiment, the aperture 40 in the base of the body 20 has a generally circular profile with
two flat, diametrically opposed surfaces 45. This configuration permits the drill chuck guard

                                                  7
10 to be inserted over a similar shaped chuck, and then rotated, for example 90 degrees to
prevent the drill chuck guard 10 from being axially removed from the drill chuck.
[0047] The operation of the drill chuck guard 10 will now be described. The drill chuck (not
shown) is fitted with the required drill bit, which typically has a square drive shaft.
[0048] The drill chuck guard 10 is placed over the drill chuck, such that the drill chuck and
drill bit enter the aperture 40. The drill chuck guard 10 slides downwardly until the drill bit is
located within the stem 50. The drill chuck guard 10 comes to rest when the gasket or 0
ring 90 comes into abutment with the upper surface of the chuck. The drill operator or
another technician may now secure the restriction formation 100, for example by securing
the screws of fasteners 110.
[0049] The stem 50 is between about 100mm and 300mm in length, and preferably around
165mm in length. The distal end 120 of the stem 50 extends beyond the end of the drill bit,
and the interface between the drill bit and the drill steel. Accordingly, if the base of the drill
steel ruptures, tears or otherwise fails, the drill steel is unlikely to be ejected from the chuck
in the direction of the drill operator. This is because the distal end 120 of the stem 50
defines a collar or sheath around the base of the drill steel.
[0050] Fig. 3 discloses a further embodiment of the drill chuck guard 10 in which the body
20 is fabricated from two independent components. Specifically, the body 20 includes a
lower body portion 25 and an upper body portion 35. The lower and upper body portions 25,
35 are separable and are connected with a corresponding male thread 45 and a female
thread 55. In this embodiment, the lower body portion 25 and the upper body portion 35
can be separated as desired. For example, if the drill operator wishes to change the drill bit,
the lower body portion 25 and an upper body portion 35 are unthreaded. The lower body
portion 25 remains beneath the chuck, and the upper body portion 35 can be removed along
with the stem 50, thereby providing access to the chuck. In this embodiment, the lower
body portion 25 can be provided with an aperture 40 corresponding with the size of the
shaft that the chuck is seated on, and the lower body portion 25 is seated on the shaft
before the chuck is added.
[0051] A second embodiment of a drill chuck guard 200 is depicted in Figs. 4 to 9. The drill
chuck guard 200 is similar to the first embodiment with some minor variations. Only the
points of difference are discussed below, and like reference numerals are used to identify
like features.

                                                 8
[0052] In the second embodiment, in order to prevent the chuck from being unintentionally
withdrawn from the drill chuck guard 200, poppets 210 are located on each of the flat
surfaces 220, as depicted in Figs 4 to 7. It will be appreciated that other systems may be
used to prevent the chuck from being unintentionally withdrawn from the drill chuck guard
200.
[0053] The drill chuck guard 200 includes a stop ring 250. The stop ring 250 is attached by
welding or otherwise secured to the end of the stem 50 which is furthest from the chuck.
The stop ring 250 prevents the stem 50 from entering the drilled hole, to avoid the drill
chuck guard 200 becoming jammed. The stop ring 250 also strengthens the stem 50,
increasing longevity of the drill chuck guard 200.
[0054] The drill chuck guard 200 of the second embodiment has slots 70 which are
reduced in length.
[0055] Furthermore, the drill chuck guard 200 of the second embodiment has a dedicated
seat 240 machined or otherwise formed in the body 20 for seating the seal washer 230. The
seal washer may be fabricated from a suitable polymer such as Acetal.
[0056] In the second embodiment, the restriction formation of the drill chuck guard 200
includes a poppet fabricated from a suitable material such as 4140 alloy steel which exhibits
good impact resistance, abrasion resistance and fatigue strength. The poppet 210 is seated
in a passage along with a steel ball bearing and a spring.
[0057] Advantageously, a proximal end of the body portion 20, adjacent to the gasket or
O-ring 90 includes additional steel which can be removed by machining in the event that the
inside of the body 20 is damaged.
[0058] Advantageously, in the event of a failure at the base of the drill steel, the stem 50
provides a sheath which protects the drill operator and nearby workers from injury.
[0059] Advantageously, the gasket or O-ring 90 may be replaced for maintenance and
servicing purposes.
[0060] Although the invention has been described with reference to specific examples, it
will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many
other forms.
