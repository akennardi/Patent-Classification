   ABSTRACT
   An explosive booster (10) shaped to fit into a blasthole adjacent a main
   explosive charge is provided. The booster (10) comprises a body (12)
   containing a charge of an explosive substance (22) with a passage (24)
 5 extending inwardly of the body (12) to receive a detonator (26) therein. The
   booster (10) is configured to alter the shape of a detonation wave generated
   upon initiation of the detonator (26). In an embodiment, the booster (10)
   includes a first (32) and a second explosive substance (34), with the first
   explosive substance (32) being shaped and selected to cause an outer
10 portion of the detonation wave to accelerate relative to the remainder of the
   wave thereby altering the shape of the wave from a generally spherical wave
   to a generally planar wave. In an embodiment, the booster includes an
   internal member capable of altering the shape of the detonation wave.

                              AN EXPLOSIVE BOOSTER
   CROSS-REFERENCE(S) TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
   This application claims priority to South African provisional patent application
   number 2014/05775 filed on 6 August 2014, which is incorporated by
 5 reference herein.
   TECHNICAL FIELD
   This disclosure relates to explosives and, more particularly, it relates to
   explosive boosters for initiating a secondary main explosive charge.
   TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
10 In order to provide for safety consideration of conventional explosives used
   for open cast or strip mining, quarry blasting or construction blasting, such
   explosives typically comprise explosive compounds which are insensitive to
   initiation by a detonator. In order to be capable of initiating the explosive
   material, a principle known as the "explosives train" is employed, wherein
15 energy released by a detonator is transferred to an intermediate charge or
   "booster", which is sufficiently sensitive to be initiated by the detonator, and
   which then amplifies the energy so as to initiate the explosive compound of
   the main charge or blasting agent.
   Various boosters have been proposed in the prior art and generally comprise
20 an elongate hollow body, typically of a plastics or cardboard material, which
   is filled with an explosive material that is more sensitive than that of the main
   charge. The body commonly includes an appropriate formation, also known
   as a detonator well, for receiving a detonator such that the detonator is
   positioned appropriately so as to ensure reliable initiation of the explosives
25 material of the booster.
   Effectiveness of explosives is largely dependent on the rate at which the
   potential energy contained in the explosive material can be released. Thus, in
                                            I

   order for an explosive to function optimally, a maximum amount of explosive
   material should be initiated in the shortest possible time.
   In this specification, "detonator" shall have its widest meaning and shall
   include any suitable form of initiation commonly used for commercial blasting
 5 including, but not limited to, non-electric detonators such as shock tube
   detonators or fuse caps, electric detonators such as instantaneous electrical
   detonators (IED) or exploding foil detonators (EFI), and electronic detonators.
   Further, "detonation cable" shall have the widest meaning and shall include
   any suitable means of transmitting a detonating signal to the detonator,
10 including, but not limited to, detonation cord, electronic or electric wire, shock
   tube, optic fibre cable, electric conductor and the like.
   The term "comprising" as used in this specification and claims means
   "consisting at least in part of'. When interpreting statements in this
   specification and claims which include the term "comprising", other features
15 besides the features prefaced by this term in each statement can also be
   present. Related terms such as "comprise" and "comprised" are to be
   interpreted in a similar manner.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE DRAWINGS
   Embodiments described herein provide an explosive booster which may be
 5 used as a bridge between a conventional detonator and a main explosive
   charge having a relatively low sensitivity to initiation. The main explosive
   charge may include any suitable charge commonly used in commercial
   blasting and may include, but is not limited thereto, ammonium nitrate-fuel oil
   (ANFO), emulsion explosives and mixtures thereof, watergels or slurry
10 explosives, trinitrotoluene (TNT), nitrocellulose, nitroglycerine and the like.
   Boosters are typically placed at the bottom of a blasthole, the booster may be
   surrounded by dust from the drilling process or water, mud or debris all of
   which have a detrimental influence on the initial detonation of the charge. It is
   therefore essential that the maximum explosive output of the booster is
15 achieved so as to ensure that the booster is capable of initiating the main
   explosive charge as efficiently as possible as the location of booster
   placement.
   Customary cast boosters such as pentolite boosters overcome these
   drawbacks due to the high detonation pressure of the pentolite explosive
20 relative to that of the main explosive charge. However, in some markets,
   pentolite boosters are typically expensive or are not readily available due to
   regulatory restrictions which may inhibit readily sourcing thereof, or their
   storage, distribution and generally their use. In such cases, emulsion or
   boosters comprising a binary explosive, often referred to as two component
25 boosters, are commonly used. Nevertheless, since the booster is initiated by
   a generally spherical detonation wave generated by the detonator, the
   booster will generate a generally spherical detonation wave which is typically
   of relatively low intensity. This results in a slow or inefficient initiation of the
   main explosive charge. Furthermore, with currently available two component
30 boosters, this effect is further pronounced due to side initiation of the main
                                            5

   booster charge by the detonator. In addition, the detonation pressure of two
   component boosters is also typically fairly low.
   Embodiments of the explosive booster herein may provide a number of
   advantages over two part or emulsion boosters. For example, by altering the
 5 shape of the detonation wave from a generally spherical to a generally planar
   wave, the output of the booster is made significantly more efficient due to the
   planar wave initiating the main charge over a wider surface. This ensures
   that a steady planar detonation wave transitions from the booster to the main
   explosive charge, thereby reducing the run-up distance, thus resulting in a
10 faster steady detonation of the main charge. This will have the effect that the
   overall energy release from the main explosive charge is improved when
   compared to using currently available emulsion or two-part booster of the
   same weight. Alternatively, the detonation is focused on a central point or
   axis, which results in overdrive of the main explosive charge thereby causing
15 the main explosive charge to fully detonate within a short period of time.
   Figures 1 and 2 illustrate an embodiment of an explosives booster (10) in
   accordance with the technology. The booster (10) has a cylindrical body (12)
   having a blind first end (14) with a closure (16) provided at an opposite
   second end (18). The closure (16) includes a skirt (20) which secures to the
20 body (12) by means of a friction fit. However, it will be appreciated that any
   suitable attachment arrangement to secure the closure (16) to the body (12)
   may be used, including a screw thread arrangement, a bayonet fitting, a rib
   and groove type arrangement for a snap fit or an adhesive. The body (12)
   and closure (16) are preferably manufactured from a cardboard type material
25 or a plastics material such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC),            high-density
   polyethylene (HDPE) or polypropylene, but any suitable material may be
   used.
   The body (12) includes an explosive substance (22) which is introduced into
   the body (12) prior to securing the closure (16) thereto. In addition, the body
30 (12) includes a passage (24) which extends into the body (12) from the first
                                           6

   end (14) and is surrounded by the explosive substance (22). Of course, the
   passage may also extend from the closure. The passage (24) is shaped to
   receive a detonator (26) therein for initiating the explosive substance (22).
   The free or output end (28) of the passage (24) is closed so as to ensure that
 5 the explosive substance (22) does not spill out during filling of the body (12).
   The passage (24) and body (12) are integrally formed, however, it will be
   appreciated that the free end (28) of the passage (24) could also be open
   and then closed prior to filling the body (12) by securing a lid or cap (28) over
   the free end (28) of the passage (24). The cap may then be secured to the
10 free end (28) by an adhesive or other suitable means. In addition, the
   thickness of the passage and cap, if appropriate, is selected such that the
   detonation wave generated by the detonator can easily penetrate so as to
   ensure efficient initiation of the explosive substance in the booster.
   In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1 and 2, the explosive substance (22)
15 comprises a first explosive substance (32) and a second explosive substance
   (34). The first explosive substance (32) is selected to have different explosive
   properties, such as a higher velocity of detonation (VOD), a higher brisance
   or a higher density, to the second explosive substance (34).
   The first explosive substance (32) may include pentolite, plastic explosive
20 (e.g. C4), octogen (HMX), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), trinitrotoluence
   (TNT) or the like. The second explosive substance (34), on the other hand,
   may include any suitable ammonium nitrate explosive including, but not
   limited to, a watergel explosive, an emulsion explosive, crystalline ammonium
   nitrate, preferably prilled crystalline ammonium nitrate, liquid ammonium
25 nitrate, or any one of the above which includes an additive such as diesel, oil,
   a suitable surfactant such as sulfonates or amines, liquid or solid molecular
   explosives, microballoons or any combinations thereof and the like.
   It will be appreciated that since the first explosive substance (32) is selected
   to have different explosive properties than the second explosive substance
                                             7

   (34), initiation of the first explosive substance (32) will be at a higher rate
   than of the second explosive substance (34). The significance thereof will be
   described in more detail further below.
   The first explosive substance (32) is located in close proximity to the free end
 5 (28) of the passage (24) to ensure that it is initiated shortly after initiation of
   the detonator (26). In this regard, retaining means may be provided to retain
   the first explosive substance (32) at a desired location within the body (12)
   during filling thereof with the second explosive substance (34). Furthermore,
   the first explosive substance (32) is shaped to define a hollow therein which
10 ensures that, once initiated, the detonation wave thereof spreads evenly
   across the entire cross-sectional area of the body (12). In addition, since the
   hollow will be filled with the secondary explosive substance (34), once the
   detonation wave reaches the hollow, the central portion thereof will
   decelerate due to the different explosive properties of the second explosive
15 substance, with the outer portions travelling at the same velocity and
   gradually decreasing as the remaining          portions reach the secondary
   explosive substance (34). This effectively permits the outer portions of the
   detonation wave to catch up with the central portion, thereby altering the
   shape of the detonation wave from generally spherical to generally planar.
20 The weight of the booster (10) may be in the range of about 50 grams to
   about 2 kilograms, preferably in the range of about 50 grams to about 500
   grams.
   In use, and as illustrated in Figure 3, a detonator (26) attached to a
   detonation cable (36) is inserted into the passage (24) of the booster (10),
25 and the booster (10) is then inserted into a blasthole (38). The booster (10) is
   inserted into the blasthole (38) with closure (16) or output end facing
   upwardly toward the bulk of the main explosive charge (42) as will be
   described in more detail further below. Since the booster (10) is inserted into
   the blasthole (38) with the detonator (26) being in the bottom of the hole (38),
30 the detonation cable (36) is bent upwardly and extends along the outside
                                            8

   surface of the booster (10). During insertion of the booster (10) into the
   blasthole (38), the booster (10) may need to be pushed downwardly or
   inwardly, as the case may be, by means of a rod or the like and since the
   detonation cable (36) extends along the outer surface of the booster (10), the
 5 cable (36) may be damaged while pushing the booster (10) into the hole. In
   order to ensure that the detonation cable (36) is not damaged, the booster
   (10) may include a channel, sleeve or tube (40) externally of the body (12)
   and through which the detonation cable (36) may pass. The channel or
   sleeve (40) will protect the detonation cable (36) from being damaged during
10 insertion of the booster (10) into the blasthole (38). Of course, the channel or
   tube may also be internally of the body or in any other suitable manner to
   ensure that the detonation cable is not damaged during insertion of the
   booster into the blasthole, provided that the channel (40) should be separate
   from the explosive substance (22) so as to ensure that it does not interfere
15 with the detonation wave or otherwise negatively affect the energy output of
   the booster through interference of partial sympathetic initiation.
   Once the booster (10) has been inserted into the blasthole (38), a main
   explosive charge (42), typically in a flowable form, is introduced into the
   blasthole (38). It will of course be appreciated that the main explosive charge
20 may also be in the form or a cartridge or semi-liquid or free flowing crystalline
   explosive. The detonator (26) is then initiated by means of the detonation
   cable (36) and generates a detonation wave having a generally spherical
   shape around the detonator base charge. The detonation wave penetrates
   the passage (24) and then initiates the first explosive substance (32). Since
25 the first substance (32) is selected to either have a higher VOD or higher
   brisance than the second substance (34), it detonates at a greater rate than
   the second substance (30).
   This increased rate of detonation as well as the shape of the first explosive
   substance (32), causes the detonation wave to rapidly spread across the
30 entire cross-sectional area of the body (12) as well as affectively accelerate
                                           9

   the outer portion of the wave relative to the central portion thus changing the
   shape or geometry of the wave from a generally spherical wave to generally
   planar wave. The planar shaped detonation wave subsequently initiates the
   remainder of the second substance (34) across the entire cross-sectional
 5 area of the body (12) and subsequently initiates the main explosive charge
   (42).
   It will be appreciated that the generally planar detonation wave generated by
   the first substance (32) will substantially increase the area of the detonation
   wave as well as the VOD thereby increasing the overall explosive output of
10 the booster (10). This increased explosive output provides for an increased
   rate and efficiency at which the potential energy of the explosive substance
   (22) can be released and transferred to the main explosive charge (42), and
   thus improves the detonation performance of the booster (10).
   Figure 4 illustrates a further embodiment of an explosive booster (60) in
15 accordance with the technology. The booster (60) is similar to the booster
   (10) illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, except that in this embodiment the first
   explosive substance (62) is located remote from the passage (64) and
   preferably adjacent the closure (66). Initiation of the detonator will again
   generate a generally spherical detonation wave, which penetrates the
20 passage (64) and initiates the second explosive substance (68). The second
   explosive substance (68) initiates as it is reached by the detonation wave
   generated by the detonator and generates a detonation wave having a
   generally spherical shape.
   When the detonation wave reaches the first explosive substance (62), the
25 rate of initiation will increase causing the wave to rapidly spread across the
   entire cross-sectional area of the booster (60). In addition, due to the shape
   of the first explosive substance, the central portion of the wave will decelerate
   relative to the outer portion, thereby altering the shape of the wave from
   generally spherical to generally planar extending over the entire cross
30 sectional area of the booster (60).
                                           10

   It will be appreciated that the high rate of initiation as well as detonation of
   the explosive substance across the entire cross-sectional area of the booster
   (60) will significantly improve the output of the booster (60) when compared
   to a booster which does not include a charge similar to the first explosive
 5 substance (62). This will again result in a more efficient energy impartation to
   the main explosive charge in the blasthole.
   Figure 5 illustrates still a further embodiment of an explosive booster (80) in
   accordance with the technology. The booster (80) again has a cylindrical
   body (82) that contains an explosive substance (84) and includes an inwardly
10 extending passage (86) into which a detonator (not shown) can be inserted.
   Similarly to the previous embodiments, a closure (88) is provided at an end
   (90) opposite the end (92) from which the passage (86) extends.
   The booster (80) further includes an internal member (94) having a frusto
   conical shape and which is manufactured from any suitable non-explosive
15 material that is capable of decelerating          a detonation wave passing
   therethrough, as will be described further below. As such, the internal
   member (94) may be manufactured from high density polymers, low density
   polymers     such    as    expanded    polystyrene,   bound   plastic  or  glass
   microballoons, any suitable metal, wood or the like. In addition, in some
20 embodiments, the internal member (94) may also simply be a thin walled
   hollow body in which the cavity is simply filled with air, thus being
   manufactured from one of the above materials with a hollow cavity.
   The internal member (94) is spaced from the passage (86) by a distance
   dependent on the shape, size and material used for the internal member
25 (94). Any suitable means of spacing the internal member within the body of
   the booster may be employed, as will be described in more detail further
   below, but the body may also simply be partially filled with the explosive
   substance, the internal member then place into or onto the substance, and
   then the remainder of the body filled.
                                            11

   Figure 6 illustrates yet a further embodiment of an explosives booster (100)
   in accordance with the technology. The booster (100) is substantially similar
   to the booster (80) illustrated in Figure 5, provided that in this embodiment,
   the internal member (102) includes a set of legs (104) to effectively space the
 5 internal member from the end (106) to which the closure (108) is secured. In
   this embodiment, and as best illustrated in Figure 7, the internal member
   (102) includes three legs (104).
   Applicant has found that the use of legs (104) works particularly well to
   ensure that the internal member (102) is appropriately spaced, however, it
10 will be appreciated that any other suitable means could be used. For
   example, a ring which engages inner surfaces of the body in a friction fit and
   which includes a number of protrusions to connect the internal member to the
   ring could also be used. Alternatively, a further tube which fits into the body
   and includes similar protrusions to hold the internal member could also be
15 used. It will of course also be appreciated that the internal member may be
   manufactured integrally with the body.
   Upon initiation of the detonator, the detonator will generate a generally
   spherical detonation wave. This detonation wave then proceeds to initiate the
   explosive substance (110), which will also generate a detonation wave being
20 generally spherical in shape. When the detonation wave reaches the internal
   member (102), the portion of the wave travelling through the internal member
   (102), thus the central portion, will be decelerated with respect to the
   remainder of the detonation wave generated by the explosive substance
   (110). Thus, the central portion of the detonation wave, or shock wave
25 resulting from the detonation wave, is decelerated while the remainder of the
   detonation wave continues at its normal velocity of detonation (VOD).
   Selecting the shape, material and spacing of the internal member (102)
   relative to the detonator correctly, permits the shape of the detonation wave
   or shock wave, as the case may be, to be altered from generally spherical to
30 generally planar across the axial cross-sectional area of the booster (100).
                                          12

   Once the detonation wave has been altered to a generally planar wave, the
   remainder of the explosive substance (110) continues to initiate across the
   entire cross-sectional area of the booster (100). Similarly to the embodiments
   described with reference to Figures 1 and 2, the conversion or alteration of
 5 the detonation wave from a generally spherical shape to a generally planar
   shape will increase the booster's (100) explosive output and hence also its
   effectiveness in initiating the main explosive charge in the blasthole.
   Where the booster includes legs to appropriately space the internal member
   or first explosive substance within the body of the booster, the closure of the
10 booster may include specifically designed grooves or formations into which
   the legs are inserted and which are capable of retaining the legs. The body
   may then be filled with the explosive substance or second explosive
   substance, as the case may be, which is typically in a liquid or gel form, and
   the closure is then simply secured to the body. Since the legs are attached to
15 the closure, the leg and internal member or first explosive substance will
   simply be forced into the liquid or gel and thereby locate in the appropriate
   location within the body. Alternatively, where other means for spacing the
   internal member or first explosive substance are used, these may first be
   introduced into the body and the remainder of the body then filled with the
20 explosive substance or second explosive substance as the case may be.
   Further alternatively, the explosive substance including the internal member
   or first explosive substance may of course also be appropriately cast and
   then simply placed into the body. Various other ways of manufacture and/or
   assembly may also be employed.
25 It will be appreciated that although the passage extends centrally into the
   body in the embodiments illustrated in Figures 1, 2, and 4 to 6, it may also be
   offset from the centre, however, in such a case the shape of the first
   explosive substance or the shape of the internal member will require
   adjustment so as to ensure that the detonation wave is appropriately altered
30 to a generally planar wave.
                                           13

   Figures 8 and 9 illustrate yet an even further embodiment of an explosive
   booster (200) in accordance with the technology. The booster (200) has a
   cylindrical body (202) that contains an explosive substance (204). The body
   (202) has an open end (206) to permit the explosive substance (204) to be
 5 introduced into the body (202), and which can then be closed by securing a
   closure (208) thereto. A passage (210) extends from the closure (208) into
   which a detonator (211) can be inserted, and which extends into the body
   (202) when secured thereto. The free or output end (212) of the passage
   (210) is closed, but it may of course also be open and then closed by
10 securing a closure or cap thereto prior to securing the closure (208) to the
   body (202).
   In addition, a wall (214) of the body (202) opposite the open end (206) is
   shaped to define a hollow (216). The wall (214) defining the hollow (216) is
   symmetrical about a central axis (218) through the detonator (211) and is
15 configured to impart a lateral component of movement to the detonation
   wave generated by the explosive substance (204). The hollow (216) in this
   embodiment has a conical shape, but it may have any suitable generally
   symmetrical configuration such as a pyramidal, spherical or the like.
   In use, when the detonator (211) is initiated, it generates a generally
20 spherical detonation wave which commences             initiating the explosive
   substance (204) held within the body (202). The explosive substance (204) in
   turn produces a similarly shaped generally spherical detonation wave. The
   spherical detonation wave propagates through the explosive substance (204)
   until it reaches the conically shaped wall (214), at which stage the wall (214)
25 imparts a lateral component of movement to the wave, as illustrated in Figure
   9. This is a result of detonation waves always exiting a surface at right
   angles. Due to the conical shape of the wall (214), the wave will be focussed
   on a central axis (220) thereby significantly increasing the degree of
   detonation along that axis (220). Clearly other shapes or configurations of
                                         14

   hollows may result in the detonation wave being concentrated on a common
   focal point.
   It will be appreciated that the focused detonation wave generated by the
   booster will significantly increase the booster's performance due to the
 5 substantial increase in temperature and pressure along the axis or point of
   focus generated by a focused detonation. The increased temperature and
   pressure in the focused region causes the main explosive charge to
   overdrive, thus increasing the explosive output and effectiveness of the
   booster.
10 Also, it will be appreciated that instead of having a body having a wall which
   defines the hollow, the explosive substance of the booster could be cast in
   such a way so as to define the hollow and the explosive substance then
   simply be placed into a tube having an open end where the hollow locates.
   It will further be appreciated that many other embodiments of a booster exist
15 which fall within the scope of the technology, particularly regarding the shape
   and configuration thereof. For example, the booster may be provided without
   a body such that the body is in effect made from the explosive or second
   explosive material, particularly where the explosive material comprises a
   crystalline or polymerized mass. In addition, the booster may have any
20 suitable shape.
   It is also envisaged that in cases where the body is manufactured from a
   plastics material, that the body is manufactured through a blow-moulding or
   injection-moulding process and that the plastics material may be reinforced
   with carbon, glass or other fibres, according to requirement, to ensure that it
25 has adequate strength. Of course, many other methods of manufacturing the
   body from a plastics material may also be employed.
   Furthermore, the body, closure and detonator passage may all form a unitary
   body with the explosive material being introduced into the body through the
   passage. Also, the booster could have a suitably shaped rib on an outer
                                           15

   surface thereof to enable the booster to be secured to another like booster or
   an explosive cartridge by means of a snap fit attachment. In addition, in the
   embodiments illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 4 to 6 extends from the end
   opposite the closure. The passage may of course also extend from the
 5 closure in which case the body is filled with the explosive substance and the
   closure then secured to the open end by inserting the passage into the
   explosive substance.
   Similarly and with reference to Figures 1, 2 and 4, in order to ensure that the
   first explosive substance is maintained at a desired height or location within
10 the body of the booster, a set of legs similarly to those employed for the
   internal member illustrated in Figure 6 and 7 may be employed. Alternatively,
   where the first explosive substance is remote from the detonator, as
   illustrated in Figure 4, the closure of the body may be provided with suitable
   attachment formations capable of holding the first explosive substance in
15 position relative to the second explosive substance.
