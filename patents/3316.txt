BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]                       The use of natural products is becoming increasingly popular with
humans and companion animals. Some of these natural products are being
incorporated into dietary supplements and medical foods. There is a need in the art
for supplements which are useful as chemoprotective and/or antioxidant agents. In
addition, there is a need in the art for pharmaceutical compositions and dietary
supplements which are useful for conditions and disorders associated with the
breast.
                                                           1

    WO 2014/008353                                                  PCT/US2013/049248
[0004]         Chemoprotection through the use of natural products is evolving as a
safe, effective, inexpensive, easily accessible, and practical means to prevent or
reduce the occurrence of many conditions affecting humans and domesticated
animals. It is known that carcinogens which can damage cells at the molecular level
are often ingested and inhaled as non-toxic precursors. These non-toxic precursors
may then convert into carcinogenic substances in the body. Chemoprotective
agents, such as natural substances which can activate detoxifying enzymes or their
co-factors, can counteract and allow for the elimination or potentiate the other
naturally existing defenses such as the immune system.
[0005]         Some natural products have antioxidant activity. Oxidative stress plays
a major role in aging, the progression of neurodegenerative diseases as well as
physiological trauma, such as ischemia. Antioxidant agents can reduce or inhibit the
oxidation of vital biomolecules and may play a role in treating, preventing, or
reducing the occurrence of cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, and
neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's Disease, dementia, and stroke are
examples of conditions affected by oxidative stress.
[0006]         Cancers are largely thought to be a consequence of exposure to
environmental challenges - whether from within (i.e. - estrogen, progesterone
hormones) or externally (i.e. - bisphenol A (BPA) from plastic) - and chronic
inflammation. Fortunately, the damage from environmental challenges can be
negated via a complex network of Phase II chemoprotective enzymes found in many
cell types of our body. It is well known that estrogens and their metabolites can lead
to the proliferation of breast tissue and tumors. Worse, the quinone estrogen
metabolites have the capacity to enter the breast tissue and migrate into the nucleus
of ductal and glandular epithelial cells. There, they bind to DNA forming quinone
estrogen DNA adducts which lead to downstream mutations. These mutations are
thought to be responsible for the very foundation of a tumor: cancer initiation.
Fortunately, a particular phase II enzyme,NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1)
can take dangerous and highly reactive quinone estrogens and metabolize them to
inert chemicals that can readily be removed from the body. Thus, a major
mechanism to decrease cancer incidence is to induce protective Phase II enzymes
including NQO1. Increased levels of NQO1 can be effective at treating, preventing,
repairing, reducing the occurrence of, decreasing the symptoms associated with any
                                             2

    WO 2014/008353                                                       PCT/US2013/049248
conditions which are resulting from high levels of quinone estrogens. Examples of
quinone estrogens include, but are not limited to catechol quinones of estrogen.
Quinone estrogens are described in the following references, each of which is
incorporated by reference in its entirety: Nutter et al. Chem Res Toxicol, 1994, 7:23
28; Cavalieri et al. Ann N YAcad Sci, 2006; 1089:286-301; Bolton et al. Chem Res
Toxicol, 2008, 21(1):93-101; and Cavalieri et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta,
2006, 1766:63-78.
[0007]         An example of a natural product thought to have chemoprotective and
antioxidant properties is sulforaphane. Sulforaphane is an organosulfur compound
which is also known as 1-isothiocyanato-4-methylsulfinylbutane. The sulforaphane
precursor, glucoraphanin, can be obtained from vegetables of the Brassicaceae
family, such as broccoli, brussels sprouts, and cabbage. However, copious amounts
of vegetables must be consumed in order to obtain levels adequate for
chemoprevention. Glucoraphanin is converted into sulforaphane by a
thioglucosidase enzyme called myrosinase, which occurs in a variety of exogenous
sources such as Brassicaceae vegetables and endogenously in the gut microflora.
However, upon ingestion of glucoraphanin, not all animals are capable of achieving
its conversion to sulforaphane, most likely due to variations in microflora populations
and overall health. In addition, in acidic environments such as the stomach,
glucoraphanin can be converted to inert metabolites. The active metabolite,
sulforaphane induces nuclear erythroid-2-related factor (Nrf2) which, in turn,
upregulates the production of Phase II detoxification enzymes and cytoprotective
enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase
(NQO1), and heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Sulforaphane has been thought to induce
the production of these enzymes without significantly changing the synthesis of P
450 cytochrome enzymes. The upregulation of Phase II enzymes is thought to play
a role in a variety of biological activities, including the protection of the brain from
cytotoxicity, the protection of the liver from the toxic effects of fat accumulation, and
the detoxification of a variety of other tissues.
[0008]         Sulforaphane and its precursor glucoraphanin have been studied
extensively. Shapiro et al. (Nutrition and Cancer, (2006), Vol. 55(1), pp. 53-62)
discuss a clinical Phase I study determining the safety, tolerability, and metabolism
of broccoli sprout glucosinolates and isothiocyanates. Shapiro et al. discuss a

placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical study of sprout extracts
containing either glucosinolates such as glucoraphanin or isothiocyanates such as
sulforaphane in healthy human subjects.        The study found that administration of
these substances did not result in systematic, clinically significant, adverse effects.
Ye et al., (Clinica Chimica Acta, 200, 316:43-53) discuss the pharmacokinetics of
broccoli sprout isiothiocyanates in humans.
[0009]          A number of mushrooms have been used or studied for their medicinal
effects. These "medicinal mushrooms" are thought to have beneficial properties,
such as antiviral, antimicrobial, anticancer, antihyperglycemic, and/or anti
inflammatory activity. Examples of medicinal mushrooms include maitake, shiitake,
reishi, cremini, almond, chestnut, wood ear, cloud ear, porcini, ink cap, yarta gunbu,
enokitake, shemeji, tiger milk, morel, bamboo, golden oyster, pink oyster, king
oyster, hiratake, cauliflower, white jelly, golden jelly, matsutake, Mexican truffle, and
straw mushrooms.
[00010]         Maitake mushrooms (Grifola frondosa) are edible mushroom
consumed widely as food and used in traditional medicine to enhance immune
function and to treat cancer. Maitake mushrooms, which contain glucans, are
thought to have beneficial properties, such as antitumor and immunomodulatory
effects. There exist standardized extracts from maitake mushroom that contain as
active ingredients glucans such as protein-bound beta-glucans. Beta 1,6-glucan, a
protein bound polysaccharide, has been identified as an active constituent in maitake
mushrooms. Maitake mushrooms have been demonstrated to have antitumor
effects, inhibiting tumor metastasis in vitro. In one study, tumor regression or
significant improvements in symptoms were observed in half of the subjects using
maitake extract. In a study of postmenopausal breast cancer patients, oral
administration of maitake extract was shown to have immunomodulatory effects.
[00011]         Shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes ) are edible mushrooms native
to East Asia. Shiitake mushrooms contain mycochemicals, which are postulated to
have antiviral, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive and anticarcinogenic
effects. This is thought to be largely a result of glucans, both alpha and beta
glucans. Some shiitake mushroom extracts have alpha glucan content greater than
40%. Additionally, lentinan (1,3 beta-D-glucan), a polysaccharide isolated from
shiitake, has been well studied and is thought to play a role in shiitake's beneficial
                                              4

effects. It has been shown to have anticancer effects in colon cancer cells, which
may be due to its ability to suppress cytochrome P450 1A enzymes that are known
to metabolize pro-carcinogens to active forms. Lentin, the protein component, has
strong antifungal properties and has been found to inhibit proliferation of leukemic
cells and suppress the activity of human immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse
transcriptase.
[00012]         Reishi mushrooms (Ganoderma lucidum), also known as lingzki
mushrooms, are edible mushrooms found in East Asia. Reishi mushrooms are
thought to have anti-tumor, anti-cancer, immunomodulatory, and immunotherapeutic
effects. Reishi mushrooms have a number of components which are thought to
contribute to its activity, including glucan, such as beta-glucan, canthaxanthin,
sterols, coumarin, ganoderic acid, and mannitol.
[00013]         Baker's yeast (Saccaromyces cerevisiae) can be a source of glucans,
in particular, beta-glucans. The active components of Baker's yeast can be
extracted in a number of ways, such as the methods described in Bacon et al.

emulsion, a soft gel/chew capsule, a chewable bar, or other convenient dosage form
known in the art. In preferred embodiments, the composition comprises a tablet,
capsule, or soft chewable treat. The orally administrable dosage forms may be
formulated for immediate release, extended release or delayed release.
[00066]        In some embodiments, at least the sulforaphane precursor, the
enzyme, and the enzyme potentiator are provided in a dosage form which allows for
the release in an area of the gastrointestinal tract having a pH of at least 4 and
preferably at least 5, such as the small intestine, preferably the duodenum. In some

embodiments, at least the sulforaphane or derivative thereof and/or the broccoli
extract or powder are provided in a dosage form which allows for the release in an
area of the gastrointestinal tract having a pH of at least 4 and preferably at least 5,
such as the small intestine, preferably the duodenum. In some embodiments, the
mushroom extract or powder and/or any optional additional components are also
released in an area of the gastrointestinal tract having a pH of at least 4 and
preferably at least 5, such as the small intestine, preferably the duodenum. The
small intestine includes the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.
[00067]        In some embodiments, each of these components (i.e, sulforaphane
precursor, enzyme, enzyme potentiator, sulforaphane or a derivative thereof,
broccoli extract or powder, mushroom extract or powder, and/or additional
components) are released simultaneously or concomitantly (i.e., within a short period
of time of each other). This provides benefits over glucoraphanin-containing
compositions formulated to release the glucoraphanin in an area of the
gastrointestinal tract having a pH below 4, such as the stomach. In low pH
environments such as this, the acidic environment may divert conversion of
sulforaphane precursor to other, physiologically inactive end products, such as
sulforaphane nitrile and epithionitrile.
[00068]        In some embodiments, the compositions may comprise orally
administrable compositions which comprise enteric coated dosage forms or any
dosage form which is resistant to degradation in an area of the gastrointestinal tract
having pH below 4, such as the stomach. For example, the orally administrable
composition may comprise a tablet or capsule comprising an enteric coating. The
enteric coating may comprise materials including, but not limited to cellulose acetate
phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate,
methacrylic acid copolymer, methacrylic acid:acrylic ester copolymer, hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose acetate succinate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose trimellitate, shellac,
cellulose acetate trimellitate, carboxymethylethylcellulose, and mixtures thereof. The
enteric coating may comprise any suitable enteric polymers known in the art. In
some embodiments, one or more of the components in the composition may be
embedded in a matrix of enteric polymers. In some embodiments, the orally
administrable compositions comprise a capsule that dissolves slowly in gastric acid

and travels to the small intestine, such as DRCAPSTM acid resistant capsules, which
are marketed by CAPSUGEL* or any other acid resistant capsules.
[00069]         In the most preferred form, the orally administrable composition is
surrounded by a coating that does not dissolve unless the surrounding medium is at
a pH of at least 4, and more preferably at least 5. Alternatively, a coating may be
employed which controls the release by time, as opposed to pH, with the rate
adjusted so that the components are not released until after the pH of the
gastrointestinal tract has risen to at least 4, and more preferably at least 5. Thus, a
time-release formulation may be used to prevent gastric presence of the
sulforaphane precursor, the enzyme capable of converting the sulforaphane
precursor to sulforaphane, and the enzyme potentiator, or of the sulforaphane. The
coating layer(s) may be applied onto orally administrable composition using standard
coating techniques. The enteric coating materials may be dissolved or dispersed in
organic or aqueous solvents.      The pH at which the enteric coat will dissolve can be
controlled by a polymer, or combination of polymers, selected and/or ratio of pendant
groups. For example, dissolution characteristics of the polymer film can be altered
by the ratio of free carboxyl groups to ester groups. Enteric coating layers also
contain pharmaceutically acceptable plasticizers such as triethyl citrate, dibutyl
phthalate, triacetin, polyethylene glycols, polysorbates or other plasticizers.
Additives such as dispersants, colorants, anti-adhering and anti-foaming agents may
also be included.
[00070]         The compositions may contain one or more non-active pharmaceutical
ingredients (also known generally as "excipients"). Non-active ingredients, for
example, serve to solubilize, suspend, thicken, dilute, emulsify, stabilize, preserve,
protect, color, flavor, and fashion the active ingredients into an applicable and
efficacious preparation that is safe, convenient, and otherwise acceptable for use.
The excipients are preferably pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Examples of
classes of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include lubricants, buffering
agents, stabilizers, blowing agents, pigments, coloring agents, flavoring agents,
fillers, bulking agents, fragrances, release modifiers, adjuvants, plasticizers, flow
accelerators, mold release agents, polyols, granulating agents, diluents, binders,

a synergistic effect. Synergy refers to the effect wherein a combination of two or
more components provides a result which is greater than the sum of the effects
produced by the agents when used alone. In preferred embodiments, the synergistic

[00092]        Consumption of Glucoraphanin as a Function of the Ascorbic Acid
Concentration.
[00093]        About 250 mg of broccoli seed extract containing about 12% (w/w)
glucoraphanin were subjected to hydrolysis by a fixed concentration of broccoli
sprout-derived myrosinase in the presence of variable concentration of ascorbic acid,
ranging from 0 to 600 pmoles/Liter. The reaction mixtures were thermostated at
38 0C; aliquots were withdrawn every 15 minutes for 60 minutes, and concentration of
glucoraphanin determined chromatographically. The rate of glucoraphanin
consumption was interpreted as the rate its conversion to sulforaphane. Graphical
representation of glucoraphanin content reduction as a function of increasing
ascorbic acid concentration results in a series of linear plots; the slopes of the linear
regression lines reflect the rate of glucoraphanin consumption, in pmoles/minute. It
is apparent that in the presence of 600 pmoles/Liter concentration of ascorbic acid,
the reaction rate increased 13-fold relative to that which proceeded in the absence of
modulatory effects of ascorbic acid.

[000941         Equimolar Conversion of Glucoraphanin to Sulforaphane.
[00095]         A two-part experiment was conducted to further elucidate the role of
ascorbic acid in modulating myrosinase activity. All solutions were prepared in 20
mM Tris-buffered saline, at pH 7.5, previously identified as an optimal for myrosinase
activity; each sample tube had 100 mg of freeze-dried broccoli powder accurately
weighed in as a source of myrosinase. Experiment was conducted at 38              OC for 2
hours, with sample aliquots removed in 30-minute increments, and both
glucoraphanin and sulforaphane content assessed by HPLC. A strongly acidic "stop"
solution was utilized to instantaneously inhibit further myrosinase activity in the
removed aliquots. A control sample contained no ascorbic acid, and the enzymatic
conversion proceeded unassisted by a co-factor.
[00096]         PART 1. In the presence of the fixed concentration of ascorbic acid, 1
mmol/Liter, an increasing amount of broccoli seed extract (about 12% glucoraphanin,
w/w) was added, ranging from 250 mg to 500 mg.
[00097]         PART 2. While keeping the amount of broccoli seed extract fixed at
250 mg, the concentration of ascorbic acid was varied from 0.4 mmol/Liter to 3.8
mmol/Liter.
[00098]         The table below presents glucoraphanin and sulforaphane expressed
in pmoles. It is apparent that within the first 30 minutes in almost all the reaction
mixtures, conversion of glucoraphanin to sulforaphane was complete. However,
careful examination of the enzymatic conversion occurring in the control sample,
without the stimulating effects of ascorbic acid, reveals an equimolar conversion of

[00099]           In the Part 2 of the experiment, the modulatory effect of the increasing
concentration of ascorbic acid on the activity of myrosinase was assessed. An initial,
apparently linear, increase in myrosinase-promoted conversion of glucoraphanin to
sulforaphane is observed to about 2 mmol/L of ascorbic acid concentration, followed
subsequently by a considerable leveling off.
[000100]          Finally, examination of sulforaphane yield of after 30 minutes within the
PART 1 of the experiment, reveals that in the presence of 1 mmol/Liter of ascorbic
acid, the fixed amount of myrosinase contained in 100 mg of freeze-dried broccoli
sprout powder is capable of generating at least 200 pmoles of sulforaphane, in a
predictably linear fashion. FIG. 1, 2, 3, and 4 demonstrate the results of this study.

[000102]       Conversion of Glucoraphanin to Sulforaphane in the Presence of
Simulated Intestinal Fluid.
[000103]       Simulated Intestinal Fluid (SIF) powder, a commercially supplied
concentrate closely approximating the human intestinal content in terms of
composition, pH and ionic strength, was used. The experiment utilized a USP
Dissolution Apparatus 2 (paddles), where into six dissolution vessels 500 mL of
Simulated Intestinal Fluid was dispensed, along with 150 mg of freeze-dried broccoli
sprout powder as a source of myrosinase. In vessels 1-4, the concentration of
ascorbic acid was varied from 0.25 to 1.00 mmol/Liter; in vessel 5, in addition to 1
mmol/Liter ascorbic acid, 3.125 g of pancreatin (8x USP) was suspended; in vessel
6, in addition to 1 mmol/Liter ascorbic acid, and 3.125 g of pancreatin (8x USP), a
doubled amount of freeze-dried broccoli sprout powder (300 mg) was added. After
vessels were brought to 38 C, 250 mg of glucoraphanin-rich (12%, w/w) broccoli
seed extract was added to each, and the resulting suspensions were stirred at 75
RPM for 2 hours. Aliquots were withdrawn every 15 minutes, and assayed for
sulforaphane. FIG. 4 shows direct correlation between larger yield of sulforaphane
and higher concentrations of ascorbic acid, especially at the earlier stages of the
experiment.
[000104]       Example 6
[000105]       The following study was conducted to determine the effect of the
combination of sulforaphane and a maitake mushroom extract containing 20% b
glucans on gene expression of Nad(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1). NQO-1
encodes a protein that is able to metabolize estrogen quinones, preventing them
from forming DNA adducts that cause mutations and ultimately carcinogenesis. An
increase in NQO-1 expression is favorable for breast, colon, liver, lung, skin and
prostate health.
[000106]       In the study, the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was treated with
DMSO (vehicle control), sulforaphane (SFN), maitake mushroom extract having
about 20% beta-glucan content (Maitake), or the combination of sulforaphane and
maitake mushroom extract, for 24 hours.      In particular, the cells were treated with
one of the following: (i) DMSO (vehicle control), (ii) 0.5 pM SFN, (iii) 250 pg/mL
