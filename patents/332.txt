   TECHNICAL FIELD
   [0001]    The invention relates to bed care, such as in medical or other patient settings.
   BACKGROUND ART
 5 [0002]    Those who are injured, or disabled, or elderly and infirm are often of
   compromised mobility, and can have difficulties negotiating simple tasks of daily living
   that the more able-bodied take for granted. Various aids have in particular been devised
   to assist those having trouble getting in and out of bed.
   [0003]    A bed stick or bed rail is used to assist to roll over in bed, or sit from a lying
10 position. A bed stick or bed rail can also assist with getting in and out of bed, or help a
   patient steady themselves when standing.
   [0004]    There are some different styles of bed sticks in existence, though often the
   entire structure consists essentially of a bent length of tubing, part of which underlies a
   mattress where it is placed to anchor the aid, and another part of which projects up the
15 side of the mattress for use by the patient. Bed sticks of this type are recommended for
   use with domestic beds only. It should also be noted that this style of equipment is not
   designed or intended to prevent someone falling out of bed.
   [0005]    Occupational therapists are usually the professionals tasked with prescribing
   aids such as bed sticks to assist with a patient's mobility.
20 [0006]    Increasingly, the risks of improperly using bed sticks are recognised and warned
   against by occupational therapists. As is appreciated by therapists, a patient risks falling if
   the bed stick comes loose from the bed, and so a daily check should be made. Also, the
   bed stick itself can represent a choking risk should a patient become trapped between
   the mattress and bed stick. This has happened, and the dangers have been highlighted
25 following coronial inquiry.
   [0007]    The described style of bed sticks suitable for domestic beds are in a different
   category to related aids used with hospital beds. This style of aid typically uses a 'clamp
   on' mechanism to affix to a side rail of the hospital bed. Bed sticks for domestic beds
   should not be used with hospital beds, and vice versa.
                                                   1

   [0008]    There exists in light of the foregoing a need for an improved form of bed aid that
   at least attempts to address limitations associated with existing aids, or to at least
   attempt to provide a useful alternative.
 5 SUMMARY OF INVENTION
   [0009]    The present invention arises from a recognition that an improved form of
   patient assist rail can serve to mitigate choking risk while maintaining the convenience of
   bed sticks typically used for domestic beds.
   [0010]    According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a patient assist rail
10 comprising a looped handrail presenting a vertical profile in use and a base attached at
   opposed sides of the looped handrail and oriented in use in a horizontal plane, generally
   orthogonal to the vertical profile of the looped handrail, the looped handrail fitted with a
   barrier spanning across at least part of the profile presented by the looped handrail.
   [0011]    The looped handrail advantageously has a stepped profile, which presents a
15 horizontal section at mid height. The looped handrail, when the patient assist rail is fitted,
   thus presents an L-shaped profile.
   [0012]      The barrier is advantageously provided in the form of a screen, more
   particularly a plate, which is generally profiled to match the profile of the looped
   handrail, and attached at intervals by tack welding along its periphery to the looped rail.
20 [0013]    The plate is advantageously attached to the looped handrail at its side sections
   rather than along a top section. A hand clearance (of, for example, an indicative 45mm) is
   maintained between a top section of the looped handrail and the plate.
   [0014]    The patient assist rail can be formed from lengths of tubing, bent to an angle and
   orientation where necessary to form the necessary configuration, and a plate fitted as
25 required to form a barrier. Advantageously, though, the base can be removably attached
   as a discrete component from the looped handrail component. This is advantageously by
   simple boltset ensuring secure attachment, which can be disassembled when required, or
   by alternative means such as via interference fit, or positive locking fit for additional
   safety.
30 [0015]    The barrier is in the preferred embodiment a screen, though may be
   alternatively fitted as a grid or mesh, or a series of stringers: such configurations serve to
                                                   2

   allow different aesthetic or decorative treatments, and provides mechanical obstruction
   while avoiding complete visual obstruction. This can prove useful when mobility is
   limited.
   [0016]    The base is advantageously a looped base which has a footprint sufficient to
 5 ensure stability in use.
   [0017]     Preferred embodiments of the present invention have manifold advantages, as
   will be apparent to those skilled in the art, some of which are described herein.
   [0018]    Using a barrier, in particular, mitigates chocking risk or related injury by
   removing the opportunity for the head or limbs to extend into the vertical profile of the
10 looped rail.
   [0019]    Segmented construction permits a considerably condensed packing volume,
   which is desirable for transport and storage purposes.

   DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
25 [0024]    The drawings cumulatively demonstrate a patient assist rail 100 having looped
   handrail 200 presenting a vertical profile and a looped base 300 formed in simple U
   shaped configuration.
   [0025]    The looped base 300 comprises two spaced apart legs 310, each attached at a
   proximal end to opposed sides of the looped rail 200, and spanned at their far end by a
30 crossbar 320.
                                                    3

   [0026]    FIGS 1 and 2 depict the patient assist rail 100 in assembled configuration, ready
   for use, whereas FIG 3 depicts the same patient assist rail 100 in exploded view, which
   conveys its disassembled configuration, ready for storage or transport.
   [0027]    Orientational terms are used herein for convenience, and generally reference
 5 the typical orientation of the patient assist rail 100 during use, and in an assembled
   configuration.
   [0028]    As is evident from the drawings, the looped base 300 is oriented in a common
   horizontal plane generally orthogonal to the vertical profile of the looped handrail 200
   in other words, an arrangement which is generally orthogonal.
10 [0029]    The looped handrail 200 is fitted with a plate 400 spanning across at least part of
   the vertical profile presented by the looped handrail 200, thereby forming a barrier. The
   plate 400 is tack welded to the looped handrail 200 along its two vertical side segments
   210, 220.
   [0030]    As is apparent, the looped handrail 200 is stepped, forming an irregular vertical
15 profile, which can be characterised as L-shaped. Intermediate the vertical side segments
   210, 220 is an intervening vertical segment 230. There is a horizontal segment 240
   between one vertical side segment 210 and the intervening vertical segment 230, which
   permits for a horizontal grip by a patient on this side of the looped handrail 200.
   [0031]    The opposite side of the looped handrail 200 features instead of a horizontal
20 segment an arched segment 250. An arched segment 250 is disposed between the
   intervening vertical segment 230 and the other vertical side segment 220. This
   configuration of the looped rail 200 provides a multiplicity of grips for a patient, at
   different heights and orientations.
   [0032]    As is evident from FIG 3, a segmented construction is adopted in the preferred
25 embodiment, to provide for a compact footprint when not in use. The looped base 300
   can be detached from the looped handrail 200, which is provided as a separate and
   unitary component.
   [0033]    The looped base 300 comprises a unitary tubed section, which is bent into two
   spaced legs 310, and crossbar 330 joining the legs 310, and at terminal ends of the legs
30 310 respective connecting segments 330. The legs 310 and crossbar 320 lie in a common
   horizontal plane, though the connecting segments 330 are spaced and oriented vertically
                                                  4

   to engage telescopically with ends of the looped handrail 200. The legs 310 splay away
   from each other as the legs 310 extend from the looped rail 200 towards the crossbar
   320. This arrangement provides for stability and strength in use.
   [0034]    The connecting segments 330 of the legs 300 are oriented in the vertical plane of
 5 the looped rail 200, and moreover are adapted to telescopically engage the looped rail
   200 and more particularly the vertical side segments 210, 220. Fixture of the connecting
   segments 330 to the looped handrail 200 is by a simple boltset 500 comprising a screw
   threaded bolt and nut, preferably a domed or cup-shaped bolt as depicted, and matching
   nut. Other fastening arrangements may be used, or arrangements involving interference
10 fit or snap fit, for example. As is evident, the connecting segments 330 of the looped base
   300, and vertical side segments 210, 220 of the looped handrail 200 feature aligned bores
   for fastening the boltset 500 to connect these components 200, 300.
   [0035]    The looped handrail 200 in its preferred form has an indicative height of about
   600mm, and width of 360mm. The legs in their preferred form have an indicative reach of
15 about 700mm. The looped handrail 200 is preferably of tubing having a diameter of
   25.4mm, at 1.2mm wall thickness. The looped base 300 by contrast is of tubing having a
   diameter of 22mm, at 1.6mm wall thickness. This permits the looped base 300, or more
   particularly the connecting segments 330 to fit inside terminal ends of the looped
   handrail 200 without interference. The connecting segment 330 has a longitudinal extent
20 of about 100mm where it fits inside the vertical side segments 210, 220 of the looped
   handrail 200 to ensure firm structural engagement.
   [0036]     FIG 4 depicts for the purpose for further illustration an alternative embodiment
   100' which shares a similar construction as regards the looped handrail 200 and plate
   400. The construction is however unitary (non-detachable), and the base is of an
25 alternative construction.
   [0037]     It will be appreciated that the patient assist rail of the invention can provide a
   sturdy and safe device suitable for hospital use. It may be shipped in a disassembled
   form, reducing shipping and storage costs, yet easily assembled for use.
   [0038]    A range of other modifications may be adopted, as would be apparent to those
30 skilled in the relevant art, without departing from the spirit and scope of the present
   invention.
