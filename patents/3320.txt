CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]          This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent
Application No. 62/016,242, filed June 24, 2014, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated
herein by reference.
FIELD OF THE DISCLOSED SUBJECT MATTER
[0002] The present invention relates to the field of agrochemical compositions and formulations.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]          Many growers do not apply starter fertilizer, insecticide, or other beneficial
agricultural treatments at the time of planting because the amount of additional transportation,
handling, and labor required for such application.
[0004]          Applying active ingredients to a large field requires the transport of large volumes
of water. The water is commonly carried on a tractor, which has a limited capacity.
Additionally, in some regions water in large quantities is unavailable. Many agricultural actives
are applied to crops or soil as sprays. The active ingredient is typically added to a tank and mixed
with a diluent such as water before being sprayed on the field or crop. The active ingredient may
be in one of many known formulation types, for example, an emulsion concentrate, an
emulsifiable solution, a microencapsulate, or a suspension concentrate. After dilution, using
currently-known formulations and techniques, a typical application rate is approximately 9
gallons/acre.   Application to 500 acres at a typical rate thus requires 4500 gallons of liquid. A
tractor carrying a full load of seeds or other plant-generative material cannot accommodate such
                                                   1

                                                                                           115111.00148
                                                                                             60979 PCT
a high volume of liquid, so fertilizer, insecticide, or other treatment at time of planting requires
multiple trips to refill the tractor's tanks.
[0005]           Rather than make these trips, most growers prefer to load seed once and plant
uninterrupted. Although this saves valuable planting time, it would be beneficial if a grower
could load both seed and fertilizer, insecticide, or other beneficial treatments once and plant
interrupted while applying a planting-time treatment.
[0006]           Thus the field of agriculture is in need of new techniques and for formulating and
applying agricultural active ingredients such as insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, pesticides,
fertilizers, and plant nutrients. In particular, advances are needed that can reduce the volume of
agricultural formulation needed to treat a particular area of field. This includes advances
increasing the efficacy of a given volume of an agricultural formulation, as well as advances that
allow more precise delivery of an agricultural formulation to the area where it can be most
effective. Such high-precision, ultra-low-volume application techniques allow greater areas to
be covered while using lower amounts of active ingredient and lower volumes of water. This
results in greater resource efficiency, as well as time savings for the grower efficiency. Such
techniques also reduce the amount of active ingredient applied to areas where such application
may be either wasteful or actively harmful.
SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSED SUBJECT MATTER
[00071           At least one aspect of the present invention is directed to an emulsifiable foaming
concentrate having (a) an organic phase comprising an agriculturally active ingredient, and an
organic solvent, and optionally at least one surfactant, and (b) a second phase comprising at least
a foaming agent and optionally a foam stabilizer and (c) a surfactant phase. In another, the
second phase is an aqueous phase. In another embodiment, the concentrate is substantially free of

the context of emulsion formulations, the term "stable" also includes the ability of the
formulation to produce foam after being stored for at least 90 days at a temperature of 50 0
Celsius and stay free of crystal residues.
[0025]          The term "substantially free" means that the formulations of interest, either as a
concentrate or as an emulsion, contain less than about 10% of the recited ingredient. As such, the
phrase "a formulation substantially free of water" means a formulation that contains less than
10% weight per volume of water.
[0026]          The term "effective amount" means an amount necessary to produce an
observable effect on unwanted plant growth, including one or more of the effects of necrosis,
death, growth inhibition, reproduction inhibition, inhibition of proliferation, and removal,
destruction, or otherwise diminishing the occurrence and activity of unwanted plants.
[00271          More particularly, the present disclosure meets the needs for ultra-low-volume,
high-precision application of agricultural active ingredients by providing a formulation capable
of being foamed and applied in-furrow during planting. The foamable formulations of the
present disclosure can be applied at between 0.25-1.00 gallons/acre, much lower than the

volumes at which conventional methods are effective. This reduces by a factor of between 9 and
36 of the volume of liquid that is required to be carried on the tractor.
[00281           In addition, the foam generated by the formulations of the present disclosure may
be applied directly in-furrow to seeds as they are being planted. This direct, precise application
of the active ingredient to where it is most needed further reduces the amount of active ingredient
that must be applied, further reducing the weight carried on the tractor.

poured into container or tank, diluted and mixed with sufficient amount of a carrier such as water
to form an emulsion. In another embodiment, the resulting emulsion may be administered
through an adapter, for example a "Y" adapter, suitable for admixing a gas, such as air, with the
emulsion at a suitable pressure in a mixing chamber or tank. In a preferred embodiment, foam is
generated upon the mixing of air and the emulsion at suitable air pressure. The volume of foam
can respectively be measured. The expansion may further be calculated on a volume/weight
basis.
