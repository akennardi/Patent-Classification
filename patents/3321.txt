Description of Embodiments
[0025] The present disclosure describes access devices and methods for providing a second
entry point to a vessel, the second entry point remote from a first entry point. The devices and
methods of the present disclosure may be used to treat occlusive peripheral vascular disease by
facilitating subintimal angioplasty. In some embodiments, access devices within the scope of
this disclosure include systems comprising: a vascular catheter having first and second lumens,
the first lumen being adapted to receive a vascular guidewire; a guide tube disposed in the
second lumen, the guide tube having a distal end with a preformed curve; a stylet disposed in the
guide tube, the stylet having a sharp distal tip configured to pierce vascular tissue; a guide tube
actuator operatively connected to the guide tube or vascular catheter, the guide tube actuator
configured to produce relative movement between the guide tube and the vascular catheter; and

                                                   4
a stylet actuator operatively connected to the stylet, the stylet actuator having a stylet
advancement mechanism. Access devices within the scope of this disclosure may provide a
system for accessing an artery beyond an occlusion and forming a blood flow lumen through
subintimal space along the occlusion.
[0026] Embodiments may be understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like parts are
designated by like numerals throughout. It will be readily understood by one of ordinary skill in
the art having the benefit of this disclosure that the components of the embodiments, as
generally described and illustrated in the figures herein, could be arranged and designed in a
wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of
various embodiments, as represented in the figures, is not intended to limit the scope of the
disclosure, but is merely representative of various embodiments. While the various aspects of
the embodiments are presented in drawings, the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale
unless specifically indicated.
[0027] In the following disclosure, various features are sometimes grouped together in a single
embodiment, figure, or description thereof for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure. Many
of these features may be used alone and/or in combination with one another. The phrases
"coupled to" and "in communication with" refer to any form of interaction between two or more
entities, including mechanical, electrical, magnetic, electromagnetic, fluid, and thermal
interaction. Two components may be coupled to or in communication with each other even
though they are not in direct contact with each other. For example, two components may be
coupled to or in communication with each other through an intermediate component.
[0028] The directional terms "distal" and "proximal" are given their ordinary meaning in the art.
That is, the distal end of a medical device means the end of the device furthest from the
practitioner during normal use. The proximal end refers to the opposite end, or the end nearest
the practitioner during use. As specifically applied to the access device of the present
disclosure, the proximal end of the access device refers to the end nearest the handle and the
distal end refers to the opposite end, the end nearest the tip of the catheter. Further, if at one or
more points in a procedure a physician changes the orientation of an access device, as used
herein, the term "proximal end" always refers to the handle end of the access device (even if the
distal end is temporarily closer to the physician).

                                                   5
[0029] References to approximations are made throughout this specification, such as by use of
the term "substantially." For each such reference, it is to be understood that, in some
embodiments, the value, feature, or characteristic may be specified without approximation. For
example, where qualifiers such as "about" and "substantially" are used, these terms include
within their scope the qualified words in the absence of their qualifiers. For example, where the
term "substantially perpendicular" is recited with respect to a feature, it is understood that in
further embodiments, the feature can have a precisely perpendicular configuration.
[0030] Figures 1-5C show various embodiments of devices for treating an occlusion in a blood
vessel. For example, the devices disclosed in Figures 1-6B may be used in performing
subintimal angioplasty. The devices shown in Figures 1-5C and described in the present
disclosure are similar to those shown in U.S. Patent No. 9,220,874, the disclosure of which is
incorporated herein by reference. As indicated above, Figures 1-5C are not necessarily drawn
to scale.
[0031] Referring to Figure 1, an access device 10 may comprise a vascular access catheter or
first catheter 42, a handle or actuator 44, a guide tube or cover tube 60, and a stylet 58. The
access catheter 42 may be coupled to and extend from the handle 44. The length and diameter
of the access catheter 42 may depend on a treatment or anatomy for which the access catheter 42
is intended for use. For example the length of the access catheter may be configured to traverse
the distance between a desired entry point into an artery and the location of an occluded portion
of the artery. In some embodiments, the length of the access catheter 42 may range from 20 cm
to 150 cm, including from 50 cm to 100 cm. The diameter of the access catheter 42 may range
from 5 Fr to 9 Fr, including from 6 Fr to 8 Fr.
[0032] Referring to Figures 2A-3B, which illustrate a portion of the access device 10
comprising a distal portion of the access catheter 42 in Figures 2A and 2B and an analogous
portion of an alternative embodiment of an access catheter 42' in Figures 3A and 3B. The
access catheters 42 and 42' are shown in cross-section, while the elements disposed within the
access catheters are not in cross-section for clarity. The access catheter 42' of Figures 3A and
3B is identical to access the catheter 42 of Figures 2A and 2B except that access catheter 42'
does not comprise a ramped surface as further detailed below. Accordingly, other elements of
the access device of Figure 1 as shown in Figures 3A and 3B (such as guidewire 30) retain the
same numerals as the embodiment of Figures 1, 2A and 2B. Disclosure recited in connection

                                                   6
with access catheter 42 of Figures 2A and 2B may be analogously applied to access catheter 42'
of Figures 3A and 3B.
[0033] With continued reference to Figures 2A-3B as well as the access device of Figure 1, the
access catheter 42 may comprise a guidewire lumen 46 and a stylet lumen 50. In some
embodiments, the guidewire lumen 46 and the stylet lumen 50 may be configured as a single
lumen. The guidewire lumen 46 may be sized to receive any suitably sized guidewire, such as
0.014 inch, 0.018 inch, 0.035 inch, etc. The guidewire lumen 46 may be configured as a rapid
exchange (RX) guidewire lumen for receiving a guidewire 30. For example, the guidewire
lumen 46 may comprise a port adjacent a proximal portion that is configured to receive the
guidewire 30. In other embodiments, a wall of the guidewire lumen 46 may be slit adjacent the
proximal portion such that the guidewire 30 can be slipped into the guidewire lumen 46 via the
slit. Further, in certain embodiments, the guidewire lumen 46 may extend to a proximal end of
the access catheter 42 and the guidewire 30 may be advanced through a port (not shown) of the
handle 44 into the guidewire lumen 46. Additionally, the guidewire 30 can be introduced into
the guidewire lumen 46 using an introducer kit (not shown).
[0034] The stylet lumen 50 may extend from the handle 44 to an opening 54 adjacent the distal
end of the access catheter 42. In some embodiments, the stylet lumen 50 curves or is ramped at
its distal end to form a camming surface 56 as shown in the embodiment of Figures 2A and 2B.
The camming surface 56 can provide additional structural support and curving guidance to the
guide tube 60 when the guide tube 60 is advanced into an extended position. In some
embodiments the stylet lumen 50 does not have a curved camming surface. For example, the
stylet lumen 50 can be substantially straight adjacent its distal end as illustrated in the
embodiment of Figures 3A and 3B.
[0035] The access catheter 42 comprises a catheter tip 47 at the distal end of the access catheter
42. The catheter tip 47 may be tapered, beveled, conical, or comprise other shapes or structures.
In some embodiments the catheter tip 47 includes a radiopaque marker configured to be visible
under fluoroscopy. The radiopaque marker can be embedded in the catheter tip 47. In some
embodiments the shape of the radiopaque marker can be selected to facilitate fluoroscopic
identification of the location and orientation of the catheter tip 47. Examples of radiopaque
marker materials include gold, platinum, platinum-iridium, and other biocompatible radiopaque
materials.

                                                  7
[0036] The guide tube 60 may be concentrically disposed within the stylet lumen 50 of the
access catheter 42. The guide tube 60 may be operatively coupled to the handle 44 and extend
from the handle 44 toward the distal end of the access catheter 42. A distal end of the guide
tube 60 may be positioned adjacent the catheter tip 47 prior to actuation of the handle 44 as
illustrated in the configurations of Figures 2B and 3B. In some embodiments, the guide tube 60
may extend beyond the catheter tip 47 following actuation of the handle 44, such as in the
configurations shown in Figures 2A and 3A. In other embodiments, the guide tube 60 may not
extend beyond the catheter tip 47 following actuation of the handle 44, such as embodiments
wherein the stylet 58 extends beyond the catheter tip 47 (as further detailed below) but the guide
tube 60 remains within the stylet lumen 50 after actuation.
[0037] As illustrated in Figures 2A and 3A, in some embodiments, the guide tube 60 comprises
a preformed curve or bend of substantially 90 degrees at the distal end of the guide tube 60. The
range of the angle of the curve or bend may be from 15 degrees to 120 degrees, including 75
degrees to 105 degrees. In some embodiments, a camming surface 56 of the stylet lumen 50
(see the embodiment of Figures 2A and 2B) can promote the curvature of the guide tube 60.
[0038] The guide tube 60 may be formed of any suitable material such as nickel titanium, shape
memory metal, superelastic metal, stainless steel, thermal plastic, etc. The outside diameter of
the guide tube 60 may be configured such that the guide tube 60 can be slidably disposed within
the stylet lumen 50. The inside diameter of the guide tube 60 may be configured such that a
stylet 58 can be slidably disposed within the guide tube 60. For example, the guide tube 60 may
be a nitinol hypotube having an outer diameter of 0.025 inch and an inside diameter greater than
0.0 14 inch such that an 0.0 14 inch diameter stylet can be disposed with the guide tube 60.
[0039] In some embodiments, the stylet 58 may be concentrically disposed within the guide
tube 60. The stylet 58 may be operatively coupled to the handle 44 and extend from the handle
44 toward the distal end of the access catheter 42. A distal end of the stylet 58 may be
positioned adjacent the distal end of the guide tube 60 prior to actuation of the handle 44 as
illustrated in Figures 2B and 3B. In some embodiments, the stylet 58 may extend beyond the
distal end of the guide tube 60 following actuation of the handle 44 as illustrated in Figures 2A
and 3A.

                                                   8
[0040] The stylet 58 may comprise a sharp distal point 62 adapted to penetrate tissue and other
material, such as blood vessel walls and occlusions. The sharp distal point 62 may comprise any
suitable design, such as faceted, pencil point, etc. The stylet 58 may be formed of any suitable
material such as nickel titanium, shape memory metal, superelastic metal, stainless steel,
thermal plastic, etc. The outside diameter of the stylet 58 may be configured such that the stylet
58 can be slidably disposed within the guide tube 60. For example, the stylet 58 may be a
nitinol wire having an outer diameter of 0.014 inch.
[0041] Referring to Figures 4A-4C, in some embodiments the handle 44 can comprise a top
portion 45A, a bottom portion 45B, a slide button 51, and a stylet actuator 59. Figure 4A is a
bottom view of the handle 44 with the bottom portion 45B removed to show internal
components and the inside of the top portion 45A. Figure 4B illustrates top view of the handle
44 configured with the guide tube 60 and stylet 58 advanced. Figure 4C illustrates the bottom
portion 45B of the handle 44.
[0042] The top portion 45A and bottom portion 45B can engage to form the handle 44. The
handle 44 may comprise wings 48 on opposing sides of the handle 44. The wings 48 can be
used to apply a distal force to the access catheter 42 from the handle 44 and/or to otherwise
manipulate the device.
[0043] In some embodiments, a proximal end of the access catheter 42 may be operatively
coupled to the slide button 51 via a catheter slide 57. In use, the slide button 51 and catheter
slide 57 may be displaced proximally causing the access catheter 42 to be displaced proximally
such that the distal end of the guide tube 60 extends from the distal end of the access catheter 42
and assumes a curved shape. (As noted above, the guide tube 60 may be shape-set or otherwise
biased to form a curved shape and assume that curved shape when unconstrained by the access
catheter 42.) In other embodiments, a proximal end of the guide tube 60 may be operatively
coupled to the slide button 51. In such embodiments, the slide button 51 may be displaced
distally causing the guide tube 60 to be displaced distally such that the distal end of the guide
tube 60 extends from the distal end of the access catheter 42 and assumes its curved shape as
illustrated in Figure 4B.
[0044] Referring to Figures 5A-5C as well as the components shown in Figure 4, in certain
embodiments, a proximal portion of the stylet 58 may be operatively coupled to the stylet

                                                    9
actuator 59. The stylet actuator 59 may comprise a spring release button 53, a spring loading
mechanism 52, and a spring 55 as illustrated in Figure 4A. The stylet actuator 59 may be
configured to displace the stylet 58 such that the distal end of the stylet 58 is displaced through
vessel wall tissue and into a vessel lumen. In use, the stylet actuator 59 can be loaded by
displacing the spring loading mechanism 52 proximally such that the spring 55 is compressed
and the spring loading mechanism 52 is releasably locked in a proximal position. The slide
button 51 may cover the spring release button 53 when the access device 10 is in a pre-ready
configuration as illustrated in Figure 5A. The slide button 51 may be displaced proximally, as
described previously, such that the spring release button 53 is exposed, such as the configuration
shown in Figure 5B. The spring release button 53 may be positioned either proximal to or distal
to the slide button 51. Displacement of the spring release button 53 causes the spring 55 to
decompress. The spring loading mechanism 52 is displaced distally as the spring 55 is
decompressed. The stylet 58, which is coupled to the spring loading mechanism 52, is displaced
distally such that the distal end of the stylet 58 extends from the distal end of the guide tube 60
as illustrated in Figure 5C.
[0045] The access device 10 may be used to perform a variety of vascular procedures, such as
transjugular vein carotid artery access, retrograde jugular vein access, bypass graft placement,
subintimal angioplasty, etc.
[0046] One exemplary procedure shown in Figures 6-71 is a subintimal angioplasty procedure
to treat an occluded artery 105. Figures 7A-71 show the artery in cross-section with the
elements of the access device disposed in various locations during the procedure. The access
device is not shown in cross-section for clarity. The cross-sectional plane for Figures 7A and
7C-71 is a plane that includes the longitudinal axis of the artery, while the cross-sectional plane
of Figure 7B is a cross-sectional plane that cuts laterally across the artery, perpendicular to the
plane of Figures 7A and 7C-71.
[0047] Subintimal angioplasty procedures may be performed in various portions of the
vasculature, including vasculature within a leg of a patient. As illustrated in Figure 6 the wall of
the artery to be treated is comprised of three layers. The inner layer is the tunica intima I. The
middle layer is the tunica media T, which is the thickest layer. The outer layer is the tunica
adventia A. These layers are labeled using the same designations in Figures 7A-71.

                                                  10
[0048] As shown in Figures 7A-7B during the procedure, a guidewire 30 is inserted into a
lumen 102 of the occluded artery 105 under fluoroscopic guidance. The guidewire 30 is
directed to penetrate the tunica intima I and is advanced into a subintimal space 106 through a
subintimal access site 104. The guidewire 30 is advanced further to reach beyond an occlusion
100, to the position shown in Figure 7A. As illustrated in Figure 7B the guidewire 30 creates
and is disposed within a subintimal space 106 between the tunica intima I and tunica media M
layers.
[0049] Referring to Figure 7C, the access catheter 42 of the access device 10 may then be
advanced over the guidewire 30 and positioned such that the catheter tip 47 is beyond the
occlusion 100. In some embodiments, the guidewire 30 is removed through the guidewire
lumen 46 of the access catheter 42. In other embodiments, the guidewire 30 remains in place.
[0050] Prior to advancing the guide tube 60, the access catheter 42 may be oriented such that the
guide tube 60 will be directed toward the tunica intima I of the occluded artery 105. To help
ensure that the guide tube 60 will be directed toward the tunica intima I and a portion of a lumen
101 beyond the occlusion 100, the orientation of the extended guide tube 60 can be determined
based on the orientation of the handle 44. For example, in the illustrated embodiment of Figures
1 and 4A, the slide button 51 is substantially perpendicular to a plane defined by the opposing
wings 48 that extends along a length of the handle 44 (the plane defined by the curve where the
top portion 45A of the handle 44 contacts the bottom portion 45B of the handle 44). The guide
tube 60 may be directed to curve in the same orientation as the slide button 51 when the guide
tube 60 extends from the distal end of the access catheter 42 (see Figure 4A). For example, if
the slide button 51 is oriented upwards, the guide tube 60 will be oriented upwards as it extends
from the access catheter 42. In certain embodiments, the orientation of the guide tube 60 may
be visually verified. For example, fluoroscopy may be used to verify orientation of the guide
tube 60. Further, as noted above, a radiopaque marker or other indicia may be used to verify the
orientation of the access catheter 42.
[0051] With the access catheter disposed as shown in Figure 7A, the slide button 51 is displaced
proximally as shown in Figure 5B, such that the guide tube 60 is displaced distally and extends
from the access catheter 42. This results in the configuration shown in Figure 7D. In some
embodiments, the slide button 51 may be displaced proximally such that the access catheter 42
is displaced proximally and the guide tube 60 extends from the access catheter 42 in the pre-

                                                     11
formed curve shape. As illustrated in Figure 7D, the guide tube 60 may thus be directed toward
the tunica intima I by the pre-formed curve at the distal end of the guide tube 60. In some
embodiments, the guide tube 60 may be directed toward the tunica intima I by the camming
surface 56 of the access catheter 42. In some embodiments, the distal end of the guide tube 60 is
positioned adjacent the tunica intima I. In other embodiments, the distal end of the guide tube
60 may be disposed within the lumen 101.
[0052] The stylet actuator 59 may be loaded by proximally displacing the spring loading
mechanism 52. The stylet actuator 59 may be activated by depressing the spring release button
53 of the handle 44. After actuation, the stylet 58 may then be disposed in the configuration
shown in Figure 7E. As shown in Figure 7E, the distal end of the stylet 58 may penetrate the
tunica intima I creating a subintimal exit site 107 and is displaced into the lumen 101.
[0053] The subintimal exit site 107 may be understood as second arterial access site with the
first arterial access site being the site the artery 105 is accessed for insertion of the first catheter
42 into the artery 105. In some procedures, the distal end of the stylet 58 may penetrate the wall
of the occluded artery 105 opposite the access catheter 42 such that the distal end of the stylet 58
may be disposed within tissue surrounding the occluded artery 105.
[0054] Referring to Figure 7F, the stylet 58 may be decoupled from the handle 44 and the access
catheter 42, and guide tube 60 may be withdrawn from the occluded artery 105 over the stylet
58. The stylet 58 is shown to enter the subintimal space 106 through the subintimal access site
104, extend through the subintimal space 106, and exit the subintimal space 106 through the exit
site 107.
[0055] A second catheter 120 may be advanced over the stylet 58 such that the distal end of the
second catheter 120 is disposed within the lumen 101 as shown in Figure 7G. The second
catheter 120 may be coupled to a syringe 122 such that blood may be aspirated through a lumen
of the second catheter 120. The aspiration of blood through the second catheter 120 may be
utilized to confirm that the distal end of the stylet 58 and the second catheter 120 are disposed
within the lumen 101. In certain embodiments, an X-ray contrast dye may be injected through
the second catheter 120 into the lumen 101 and visualized using fluoroscopy to show blood
movement and thereby confirm proper placement of the stylet 58 and end of the second catheter
120. In some embodiments, the distal end of the stylet 58 may be disposed within tissue outside

                                                    12
of the occluded artery 105. In such embodiments, the second catheter 120 may be partially
withdrawn until blood is aspirated through the second catheter 120. The second catheter 120
may be withdrawn over the stylet 58 from the occluded artery 105.
[0056] Referring to Figure 7H, a balloon catheter 125 comprising a stent 126 may be advanced
into the occluded artery 105 over the stylet 58 such that a distal end of the balloon catheter 125
is disposed in the lumen 101. The proximal end of the stent 126 may be positioned within the
lumen 102, a middle portion of the stent 126 may be within the subintimal space 106 and
adjacent the occlusion 100, and a distal end of the stent 126 may be positioned within lumen
101.
[0057] Referring now to Figure 71, the stent 126 may be expanded such that a blood flow lumen
103 is formed through the expanded stent 126 from the lumen 101 to lumen 102 within the
subintimal space 106. The occlusion 100 may be bypassed by the lumen 103 such that blood
flows freely from the lumen 102 to the lumen 101. In some embodiments, the occlusion 100
may be at least partially compressed as the stent 126 is expanded.
[0058] Access to the lumen 101 as shown in Figures 7F and 7G can be used to perform various
procedures, including inflation of an angioplasty balloon to compress the occlusion, deployment
of stents in other locations, and/or access and therapies at locations beyond the occlusion.
