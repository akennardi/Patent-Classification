       A LOW FLOW EMITTER WITH ECHELON SHAPED TEETH
                                  TECHNICAL FIELD
[001]            The present subject matter described herein, in general, relates to
drip irrigation, and more particularly to an emitter used in the drip irrigation.
                                    BACKGROUND
[002]            Conventionally, achieving low       flow in an emitter involves
minimizing the cross sectional area of the flow path. There are two ways to reduce
the cross sectional area of the flow path, i.e. either by lowering the ceiling or by
minimizing teeth gap. The flow in the flow path is disrupted by inserting teeth.
The problem with the above methods of reducing the cross sectional area of flow
path is increasing the likelihood of the flow path clogging. Clogging happens
when small particles entering from the inlet gets accumulated in microscopic
openings. The end result is that water no longer flows in the flow path, rendering
the emitter un-usable. It is desired to address this or at least provide a useful
alternative.
                                      SUMMARY
[003]            This summary is provided to introduce aspects related to an emitter
and the aspects are further described below in the detailed description. This
summary is not intended to identify essential features of the claimed subject
matter nor is it intended for use in determining or limiting the scope of the

comprise of an echelon shaped teeth portion. The echelon shaped teeth portion
may at least partially extend between a first side of the emitter and a second side
of the emitter. The echelon shaped teeth may run parallel to the first edge, and the

                               DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0021]          The present subject matter discloses an emitter configured to allow
for low flow rate of water in a drip irrigation system.
[0022]          In the proposed invention, the echelon shaped teeth allows the
emitter to better disrupt the flow of fluid, thus creating more vectors in the flow
path which results in a lower flow when compared to the same emitter using the
typical straight tooth design.
[00231          In addition to lower flow, the echelon shaped teeth enables opening
up the flow path by raising the ceiling and creating more distance between teeth.
                                           3

This provides the advantages of reducing the flow rate and a lesser chance of
clogging due to the increased cross-sectional area of the flow path.
[0024]            Referring to Figure 1, a perspective view of an emitter 100, in
accordance with an embodiment of the present subject matter. The emitter 100
may comprise of a plurality of holes 106, running along a first edge 102 and a
second edge 104 of the emitter. The plurality of holes 106 may act has additional
filter for filtration of slits and/or impurities. Further, the plurality of holes 106
may run along periphery of the emitter 100. The plurality of holes may extend on
entire length of the emitter 100 or at least partial length of the emitter 100,
between a first side 110 and a second side 112. The emitter 100 may further
comprise of an echelon shaped teeth portion 114. The echelon shaped teeth
portion may run parallel to the first edge 102 and the second edge 104. Further the
echelon shaped teeth portion 114 at least partially extends between the first side
110 and the second side 112. According to an exemplary embodiment creating
more distance between two consecutive teeth' si.e. a gap between two consecutive
teeth of the echelon teeth shaped portion may be substantial to provide increased
cross-section.

TT 17 x 15 complete 3 up" and "8 inch TT Deluxe 17x15" flow model, which
have their own flow rates. The two embodiments can be implemented in different
situations based on the flow-rate required.
