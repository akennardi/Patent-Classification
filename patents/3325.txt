ABSTRACT
The present invention relates to a milk crate including: a four-sided base; four sidewalls, each
upstanding from each side of the base at an upwardly outwardly diverging angle, preferably in
the range of about 92 to 95 degrees, to allow nesting of a like milk crate; an opening defined
between upper portions of the four sidewalls; and at least a pair of load bars, each associated
with an opposed pair of side walls, movable between an undeployed position and a deployed
position. The load bars obstruct at least part of the opening when in the deployed position and
thereby provide a surface for a like milk crate to be stacked thereon and the load bars do not
substantially obstruct the opening to allow nesting of a like milk crate when in the undeployed
position. Preferably, the load bars are each releasably engageable with their respective sidewall
when in the undeployed position via a snap-engage fitting. Preferably, the load bars are also
releasably engageable with their respective adjacent sidewalls in the deployed position via a
snap-engage fitting.

A MILK CRATE
Field of the Invention
[0001] The present invention relates to a milk crate.
Background of the Invention
[0002] Milk crates are well-known products used in the delivery of bottles or other containers of
milk. To date, commonly used milk crates are generally cube shaped containers with an open
top that are stackable on each other when full or empty. They therefore occupy large amounts of
space, even when empty. As a result, milk crates are often stored in unsecured areas, (e.g.
outside a shop), leading to theft and damage.
[0003] A bread crate is known, which is both nestable and stackable. However, the mechanism
providing both nestability and stackability is difficult to reliably operate and the nesting ratio is
too low to significantly reduce space requirements when stacking empty crates.
Object of Invention
[0004] It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least ameliorate the
above disadvantages, or at least provide a useful alternative.

Description of Embodiments
[0032] Figs. 1-4 show an embodiment of a milk crate 10 including a square base 12 and four
sidewalls 14, each with a webbed structure. As seen in Fig. 1, the base 12 also has a webbed
structure and includes a perimeter cavity 13, as best seen in Fig. 4. The milk crate 10 is injection
moulded from plastics material. The sidewalls 14 include a lower portion 14a, an upper portion
14b and an uppermost edge 14c. As shown in Fig. 4, the sidewalls 14 project at an upwardly
outwardly diverging angle 15 of 93.5 degrees from the base 12.
[0033] As best seen in Figs. 1 and 2, an opening 26 into the interior of the milk crate 10 is
defined between the upper portions 14b of the sidewalls 14. Four columns 18 are located on the
adjoining edges between two adjacent sidewalls 14 and are formed in a V-shape. As shown in
Fig. 3, the columns 18 include an upper column portion 18b and several stacking ribs 16. The
stacking ribs 16 are located at the upper column portion 18b and are outwardly facing.
[0034] Two load bars 20 are associated with the sidewalls 14, which each include a load bar
surface 21 and a side ribbing 22. As best seen in Fig. 7, one side of each of the loads bars 20
includes an elongate flange 23a extending along their distal edges. As best seen in Fig. 8, the
other side of each of the load bars 20 includes a pair of tabs 23b at each transverse edge. As
shown in Fig. 1, the load bars 20 also include a steel load bar rod 25, embedded therein during
injection moulding. The load bars 20 are mounted at the uppermost sidewall edge 14c by hinges

                                                   6
24 that allow the load bars 20 to pivot from an undeployed position, as shown in Figs. 2 and 4, to
a deployed position, as shown in Figs. 1 and 3.
[0035] The use of the milk crate 10 will now be described.
[0036] Figs. 1 and 3 show the milk crate 10 with the load bars 20 in the deployed position. In
this position the load bars 20 partially obstruct the opening 26. The tabs 23b of the load bars 20
snap-engage with the uppermost edge 14c of their respective adjacent sidewalls 14 to retain the
load bars 20 in the deployed position.
[0037] Figs. 2 and 4 show the milk crate 10 with the load bars 20 in the undeployed position. In
this position the opening 26 is unobstructed by the load bars 20. The elongate flanges 23a of the
load bars 20 snap-engage with their respective sidewalls 14 to retain the load bars 20 in the
undeployed position.
[0038] As seen in Fig. 5, several like milk crates 10, with their load bars 20 in the undeployed
position, can be nested within one another. The stacking ribs 16 transfer the load of a nested
milk crate 10 to the next milk crate 10 in a nested stack. As the load bars 20 are locked into the
undeployed position by the elongate flange 23a snap-engaging with the sidewalls 14, they
remain in this nestable position during handling or transport.
[0039] As shown in Fig. 6, several like milk crates 10, with their load bars 20 in the deployed
position, can be stacked atop one another. The load bars 20 distribute the load of a stacked milk
crate 10 to the columns 18 of the milk crate 10. In this stacked configuration, the side ribbing 22
and elongate flange 23a of the load bar 20 engage with the perimeter cavity 13 of the base 12.
As the load bars 20 are locked into the deployed position by the tabs 23b snap-engaging with the
uppermost sidewall edge 14c of their respective adjacent sidewalls 14, they remain in this
stackable position during handling or transport.
[0040] The milk crate 10 has several advantages.
[0041] In the nested configuration, as shown in Fig. 5, the snap engagement of the elongate
flanges 23a with their respective sidewalls 14 ensures the load bars 20 do not move during
handling thereby improving the logistics, particularly ease of use, of nesting and stacking like

                                                   7
milk crates 10. Handling is further improved by the stacking ribs 16, which transfer the load of a
stacked like milk crate 10 to the next in a nested stack. As the load is transferred using edge
contacts, rather than surface contacts, wedging (e.g. jamming or locking together) of nested like
milk crates 10 is far less likely to occur.
[0042] In the stacked configuration, as shown in Fig. 6, the engagement of the side ribbing 22
and the elongate flange 23a with the perimeter 13 prevent translation of stacked like milk crates
10, particularly for secure storage and transport during use. The snap-engagement between tabs
23b and uppermost sidewall edges 14c prevent unwanted movement of the load bars 20 from the
deployed to an undeployed position, improving handling. The load bar rod 25 improves the load
carrying capacity of the milk crate 10 by further distributing the load of a stacked like milk crate
10 to the V-shaped columns 18.
[0043] The upwardly outwardly diverging angle 15 is chosen to allow for a nesting ratio of about
3.5. The reduction in necessary storage space thereby achieved is a significant economic
incentive to purchase and use the milk crate 10, and provides for empty storage in more secure
locations.
[0044] The V-shape of columns 18 increases their structural strength and thus reduces the
material required to produce the milk crate 10. Similarly, the webbed structure of the sidewalls
14 increases rigidity and structural strength while reducing material usage. The webbed
structure of the base 12 also provides support to the goods contained in the milk crate 10 while
reducing the material used to produce the milk crate 10.
[0045] Notwithstanding the provision of the load bars 20, which provide for stackability, and the
upwardly outwardly diverging angle 15, providing nestability, the overall dimensions of the milk
crate 10 are advantageously compatible with existing infrastructure.
[0046] Although the invention has been described with reference to specific examples, it will be
appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many other forms.
[0047] The upwardly outwardly diverging angle can also be in the range of 92 to 95 degrees.
Although the milk crate has been described as having a square base with four sidewalls, other

                                                8
variations including more or fewer sidewalls with a corresponding base can also be conceived.
Further load bars may also be associated with the upper portion of the columns.
