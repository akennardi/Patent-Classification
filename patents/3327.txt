                                             ABSTRACT
   The invention relates to an hydrofoil section (401) comprising upper (4014) and lower (4015,
   4018, 4017) cambered profiles and a reference line in which the reference line is drawn
 5 between the trailing edge (307) of the section and the leading edge (304) or a point close to
   and below such leading edge. Both profiles have a positive camber and a substantial part of
   the lower profile lies above such reference line. The area bounded by such reference line and
   by such lower profile lying above such reference line is greater than any area lying below
   such reference line.

                          Section profiles for planinq hydrofoils and hydrofoils
                                 operating close to a free water surface
 5 This application is a divisional application of Australian patent application 2013340744, the
   contents of which are incorporated herein by this reference.
   This invention relates to a new form of sections for hydrofoils for high-speed marine craft. The
   sections are configured such that they provide both high lift coefficients and high ratios of lift
10 to drag over a wide range of craft speeds, whether running submerged in close proximity to
   the free surface of the water or planing thereon. In this context the expression "running
   submerged in close proximity to the free surface of the water" means a hydrofoil which is
   designed to operate at a depth/chord ratio preferably of less than one.
15 The invention has particular application to the use of high speed catamarans and other
   surface craft which can benefit from the greatly reduced power consumption and improved
   ride and handling provided.
   Whilst the majority of applications are likely to be for faster craft, the lift and drag
20 characteristics of the new sections are such that significant reductions in hull resistance have
   been recorded at displacement Froude numbers only a little above 1.0 such that the new
   sections also have application to relatively heavy commercial and workboats.
   Once fully planing the lift to drag ratio increases steadily with speed such that the power
25 requirement remains relatively constant over a wide speed range, essentially only increasing
   due to the increasing wind resistance.
   The displacement Froude number Fnv is given by the following expression:
           Fnv = VN(g - A%)
30
   where V is the velocity of the craft, A is the volume of water displaced by the hull when it is at
   rest and g is the rate of acceleration due to gravity (all in consistent units).

   Referring to Figure 1 curves 1 show a rapid reduction in lift coefficient for sub-cavitating
   sections as the hydrofoil nears the water surface. Although not shown on this figure the
   lift/drag ratio also falls away due to an increasing effect of the friction drag. Initially this
35 reduction is quite slow, but as the value of d/c approaches 0.25 the reduction in the lift/drag
   ratio becomes increasingly marked. Curve 11 shows the variance of the lift coefficient with the

                                                    5
   depth/chord ratio for an efficient hydrodynamic section with a slightly concave under surface.
   Curve 12 shows the variance for a more classic aerofoil section which a slightly convex under
   surface. The difference is due to the increasing reliance on the pressure distribution on the
   lower surface as a cavitation bubble increasingly grows on the upper surface which becomes
 5 fully ventilated at some point. Both sections have a 2D lift coefficient of 0.63 when deeply
   immersed.
   Referring to Figure 2 the opposite effect is evident for cavitating sections. For the flat plate
   shown by curve 2 the lift coefficient doubles between deep immersion and zero immersion
10 with most of this occurring when the hydrofoil is very close to the surface. The curve for more
   efficient cavitating sections follows the same trend although the overall increase in lift
   coefficient is reduced from 100% to generally 25% to 50%. The lift/drag ratio for a cavitating
   section tends to improve as the surface is approached. The frictionless value tends to be little
   changed but the friction coefficient has a reducing effect as the lift coefficient increases close
15 to the surface.
   Referring to Figures 3 and 4 it is evident that the lift coefficient is increasingly reduced as the
   depth/chord ratio reduces, particularly in the region around a chord Froude number of 1,
   where the chord Froude number is given by the expression
20
            Fe = V/(g - C)
   where V is the velocity of the craft, C is the chord of the hydrofoil section and g is the rate of
   acceleration due to gravity (all in consistent units).
25
   Line 4 of Figure 4 shows the variation of F. with craft speed for a chord of one metre from
   which it can be seen that a significant reduction in lift coefficient is to be expected as the
   hydrofoil section approached the surface, particularly in the range of speeds from 5 to 10
   m/sec at which a high lift coefficient may be required to get a craft foil borne.
30
   It will be evident from Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 that the design of a suitable section is highly
   dependent on the range of immersion depth intended, particularly if operation within the range
   of immersion depths between 0.5 and zero is expected.
35 Referring to Figures 5 and 6 the benefit is shown of using a planing hydrofoil section arranged
   for constant wetted span in which the chord reduces and by consequence the aspect ratio

                                                  6
   increases as the speed increases. Figure 5 shows the rapid improvement in the lift/drag ratio
   as the aspect ratio is improved. It also shows that the camber and associated value of the lift
   coefficient based on span must be carefully selected to lie within a desired range of lift/drag
   values. Figure 6 shows values of CL and the lift/drag ratio for hydrofoils having aspect ratios
 5 of 5 and 10 with the same section with the lift coefficient varied by changing the angle of
   attack. These curves show the importance of maintaining an optimum angle of attack with the
   performance dropping away rapidly as the angle of attack is increased. The aspect ratio is
   equally of key importance.
10 Referring to Figure 7 and Figure 8 a hydrofoil section 401 is shown together with details 300
   for designing such profile. An upper section 4014 may be created by drawing a conic between
   points 302, 305 and 306 in which a weight may be assigned to curve point 305. A straight line
   may be drawn between points 306 and the trailing edge point 307. An aft lower section 4017
   may be created by drawing a further conic between points 307, 308 and 309 and a weight
15 assigned to the curve point 308. A mid lower section 4018 may be created by drawing a
   further conic between points 309, 310 and 311 and a weight assigned to the curve point 310.
   A line may be drawn between points 311 and 303 to create the forward underside section
   4015. Referring to Figure 8 a leading edge section 4012 may be created by drawing a conic
   between points 303, 301 and 302 which passes through the leading edge point 304.
20 Alternatively the leading edge section 4012 may be created by drawing two conics between
   points 303, 3031 and 304 and between 304, 3021 and 302 and weights assigned to curve
   points 3021, 3031. In order to fine tune the pressure distribution around the leading edge it is
   sometimes beneficial to move the leading edge point 304 upwards or downwards along the
   line between points 3021 and 3031 and to consider assigning different weights to curve points
25 3021 and 3031 in order to provide a local inflexion in the mean camber line in the leading
   edge section 4012. Straight lines and conical sections are preferentially arranged to be
   tangent continuous other than at the curve or apex points of the conical sections and at the
   trailing edge.
30 Referring to Figures 9 and 10, a mixture of conics and lines may be used to create sections
   402 and 403 using the above techniques.
   Referring to Figure 11, the selection of curve points and weights and feeding the resulting
   profiles into a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis software package the pressure
35 distribution and other sectional attributes may be produces for deeply immersed, shallowly
   immersed or planing conditions. Figure 11 shows pressure distribution curves 100 acting on

                                                     7
   the upper surface and 110 acting on the lower surface of hydrofoil sections produced using
   figure 9 with curves 101, 102, 103 and 104 produced by assigning different curve point
   weights to points 3021, 3031 and 305 and by omitting or including point 306. By combining a
   point creation code and a CFD code sections conforming to particular design criteria may be
 5 produced and optimised automatically providing much faster and much smoother sectional
   profiles than have been heretofore possible. This is particularly the case for shallowly
   immersed sections and for planing sections for which neither software nor standard profiles
   are available. Whilst planing profiles have not heretofore existed, shallowly immersed
   sections for use with hydrofoil assisted catamarans and other hydrofoil craft have generally
10 been poorly specified.
   Referring to Figures 12 and 13 profiles 401 of Figure 7 and 402 of Figure have been
   extracted. Figure 12 shows a new profile for planing or shallow immersion characterised by a
   pronounced 'bustle' 4017 at the aft end of the lower surface an inflexion curve 4018 ahead of
15 the 'bustle', a flat or slightly convex forward section 4015 and a relatively sharp leading edge
   4012. For some applications a more curved leading edge similar to curve 4022 of Figure 13
   may be applied. Figure 13 is more similar to classical aerofoils but with key differences which
   are described below. This profile is generally better suited to slower craft and relatively
   deeper immersion. Flaps 4011, 4021 (not illustrated) may be applied to the sections shown.
20
   Referring to Figures 14 to 17 section 401 of Figure 12 is shown at generally increasing speed
   and decreasing immersion. In Figure 14 the section is fully immersed and fully wetted. The
   leading edge is shown at a depth d below the free surface 201. The water surface 202
   immediately ahead of the hydrofoil 401 and for some distance (not shown) aft of the hydrofoil
25 is distorted by the thickness of the hydrofoil and by the lift it generates. In the submerged
   state the camber line 502 shows a significant camber 503 from the chord reference line 500.
   Although the mean camber line 502 is shown following aeronautic practice it is generally
   more useful for hydrodynamic purposes to consider the camber of the upper and lower lifting
   surfaces separately. Figure 15 shows a cavitation bubble 205 starting to form at the leading
30 edge. Figure 16 shows the upper surface of hydrofoil 401 fully ventilated with an upper
   ventilation boundary 203 and a low ventilation boundary 204. Figure 17 shows a reduced
   immersion depth d, with a trailing edge flap 4011 deflected downward increasing the camber
   503, This would correspond generally to a'lift-off ' condition for a craft.
35 Referring to Figures 18 to 20 which show hydrofoil profile 401 operating in a fully planing
   state. In Figure 18 the profile is just fully planing with the free surface water level 201 at or

                                                    8
   close to the leading edge. The camber 501 is now defined by the lower surface of profile 401
   and reference line 500 drawn between the trailing edge 4013 and a point tangential to the
   lower curved leading edge section 4012 or to the intersection between the lower surface of
   the leading edge section 4012 and the forward underside section 4015 of Figure 12. The
 5 camber is much reduced relative to the camber 503 of the immersed section of Figure 14
   indicating a large reduction in lift coefficient compared to the fully immersed section.
   However, as above noted for hydrofoil sections it is more useful to consider the cambers of
   the upper and lower sections separately rather than the shape of the mean camber line 502
   usually considered in aeronautic practice. If so considered there is less significance between
10 the camber of the lower immersed surface and the planing surface of the section 401. The
   camber to effective chord ratio is given by the length of line 501 divided by the length of the
   effective chord line 500 and is 2.15% in this condition for this section 401.The maximum
   camber point is well aft being situated 82.4% from the front of the effective chord line. By
   reference the maximum camber of the lower surface of a NACA 67A 709 section measured in
15 the same manner is 0.64% at 80.2% chord. Figure 19 shows the profile at or close to its
   design condition in which the forward end of the chord is now defined by the spray root
   generated by the planing section. The camber 501 is somewhat increased in this condition
   such that the camber/chord ratio is substantially increased to 4.5% positioned 65.5% along
   the effective chord line indicating a significant increase in lift coefficient. In this condition the
20 angle of attack is substantially reduced such that the lift/drag ratio is substantially increased.
   Figure 20 shows the hydrofoil profile 401 with a trailing edge flap deflected downwards
   resulting in a further increase in camber 501 to 3.6% of the effective chord positioned 84.4%
   along the effective chord line. This condition corresponds to the status immediately post
   becoming foil-borne for a preferred case where a flap is fitted.
25
   Figures 21 and 22 refer to section 402 of Figure 13 without and with the presence of a
   downwardly deflected flap 4021 and in the fully planing state. For the unflapped case the
   camber 501 is very small for this section with a camber/effective chord ratio of 1.11% at
   83.5% of chord. Due to the relatively larger leading edge thickness of section 402 compared
30 to section 401 it can be expected that the spray root point will form at a point 515 some
   distance aft of the leading edge. With a downward flap deflection of 10 degrees these figure
   become respectively 3.8% and 80.7%.
   Figures 23 and 24 correspond to the hydrofoil profile of Figure 13 in the fully immersed and
35 fully wetted condition and show the high camber 513 for this section in this condition.

                                                     9
   Referring to Figure 25 which shows the pressure distribution for the hydrofoil profile 401 of
   Figure 12, the upper line 101 shows a relatively high negative pressure extending across
   virtually the whole chord. A High negative pressure spike just aft of the leading edge will
   result in the early formation of a cavitation bubble in the area and assists the transition to fully
 5 ventilated flow. The key feature of this profile is the high positive pressure acting on the
   underside of the profile particularly ahead of the trailing edge and the complete absence of
   areas of negative pressure at all expected angles of attack as shown by curve 111 S. About
   33% of the total lift is due to the positive pressure acting on the underside of the hydrofoil
   section. At slow speed the high lift coefficient has the effect of lifting the craft. As the speed
10 builds the upper part of the section start to ventilate, but the positive pressure acting on the
   underside increases in line with curve 2 of Figure 2.
   Referring to Figure 26, line 111 P shows the positive pressure distribution acting on the
   underside of section 410 in the design planing state. Under this condition the effective chord
15 is designed to reduce to about 55% of the total chord as the section lifts partially out of the
   water. The figure of 55% will vary from section to section and depends on the ratio of foil
   borne speed to maximum design speed for the craft in question. Comparing curve 111 P with
   the aft 55% of curve 111S of Figure 25 it can be seen that the pressure distributions are
   virtually the same except that in the planing state the pressure coefficient tends to zero rather
20 than unity. The section characteristics show q relatively high lift coefficient and an extremely
   high lift/drag ratio compared to other planing or cavitating sections. This is due to the fact that
   a higher 'bustle' can be used for this innovative planing section than would be possible for a
   cavitating submerged section in that the upper cavity is ventilated and consequently higher
   than for a submerged section and that the extended chord increases the height under the
25 cavity boundary. Also, once planing there is no flow over the hydrofoil section other than,
   perhaps, under wave conditions so any notion of cavity thickness fall away.
   Referring to Figure 27, pressure distribution curves are shown for the hydrofoil profile 402 of
   Figure 13 and for a NACA 67A 709 section under deep immersion conditions. It can be seen
30 that curve 102 showing the computed negative pressure for profile 402 is more constant and
   extends over a greater area than for the NACA profile consequently increasing the lift with
   little or no effect on cavitation or ventilation inception. The greater differences are however
   between curves 112 and 113 showing the pressure distribution on the underside of the
   sections. Here it will be seen that the positive pressure is higher for curve 113 right across the
35 chord, but particularly so towards the trailing edge. This has a major impact on the lift/drag
   ratio. Additionally, the NACA section has a negative pressure zone on the underside which

                                                     10
   will result in cavitation on this surface at higher speeds which will have a very negative impact
   on performance at higher speeds. The new section 402 shows no negative pressure zone on
   the underside all normal angles of attack.
 5 With reference to Figures 28 and 29 shown for the much studied sections according to US
   patent US3946688, whilst Figure 28 shows a moderately advantageous pressure distribution,
   the distribution calculated for the case of Figure 29 is very poor with large areas of negative
   pressure on the underside both in the region of the leading edge and the flap pivot. The lift
   would fall away very quickly for this section as it approached the free surface.
10
   With reference to Figure 30, the pressure distribution is shown for a much used Speer H105
   hydrofoil section. This section was designed specifically for use with hydrofoils but is very
   unsuited to shallow immersion operation. Lines 104 and 114 show the pressure distribution
   for the upper surface and the lower surface of the profile respectively. The large negative
15 pressure extending over much of the lower surface will result in a sharp fall in lift as the
   section approaches the water surface. Even for normal operation the fact that both the upper
   and the lower surface produce negative lift with only a small pressure differential means that
   the lift/drag ratio is poor. The peak negative pressure on the upper surface is not high, but it is
   high relative to the lift coefficient.
20
   With reference to Figure 31, section data for the new profiles 401/4011, 402/4021 is shown
   together with NACA 67A 709 profile 403/4031 and Speer H1 05 sections 404/4041.
   With reference to Figure 32 it is shown that the new sections not only exhibit much improved
25 pressure distribution, but also higher lift coefficients and very much higher lift/drag ratios. The
   overall thickness for the sections is similar other than for the thicker Speer section. Critically,
   the positive lift generated by the underside of the section is significantly higher for the new
   sections.
30 Whilst the figures show two particular preferred embodiments of the current invention it will be
   clear that the methodology of the present invention may be used to design optimised hydrofoil
   profiles for any condition of depth, speed and required lift coefficient.

   4.     A hydrofoil section according to claim 1 in which a significant part of the lower profile
          extending from the leading edge of the section is made up of a generally straight or
          slightly curved line which is generally parallel to the reference line.
25 5.     A hydrofoil section according to claim 4 in which the generally straight line extends
          over a length exceeding 10% of the length of the reference line.
   6.     A hydrofoil section according to claim 1 which comprises at least one conic such that
          the section pressure and velocity characteristics may be varied by adjusting the
30        position of such conic or conics and by the adjusting the weight assigned to the any
          vertex or curve point thereof.
   7.     A hydrofoil section according to claims 1 and 6 entirely created from conics and
          straight lines.
35

                                           12
  8. A hydrofoil section according to claims 1 and 7 in which lines are arranged to be
     tangent continuous other than at any vertex or curve point of any conic section and at
     the trailing edge.
5 9. A hydrofoil section according to claims 1 and 7 in which the section shape and
     hydrodynamic characteristics are optimised by alteration of the points and conic vertex
     or curve point weights within a computer programme.
