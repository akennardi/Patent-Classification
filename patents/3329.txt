 TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001] The present invention relates generally to wireless beacon technology. More
particularly, this invention relates to a wireless beacon system installed in a funerary urn
or a similar receptacle.
BACKGROUND
[0002] There are countless statues, memorials, memorial stones and other remembrance
devices throughout history which are used to remember the deceased. These memorials
can range from personalised plaques to monuments. These are generally static objects
which are not designed to be moved, or may be objects to remember the deceased.
[0003] While these memorials are generally used to remember a person or other
significant person or object, these memorials are generally static and do not allow others
to see moments with a deceased person.
[0004] Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons can be utilised for the display of
multimedia using in-range electronic handheld devices. For example, BLE beacons may
be placed at museum exhibits wherein electronic devices, utilised by visitors, are able to
scan for BLE broadcast from such beacons to display information for each exhibit.
[0005] . The present invention may provide a system, which will overcome or
substantially ameliorate at least some of the deficiencies of the prior art, or to at least
provide an alternative.
[0006] Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
general knowledge in the field.
SUMMARY
[0007] PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0030] Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to
the accompanying drawings and non-limiting examples.
[0031] Figure 1 shows an electronic device 100. The electronic device 100 comprises a
microprocessor 101 for processing digital data. The microprocessor 101 (also referred to
herein as processor 101 )may take the form of a central processing unit (CPU), graphical
processing unit (GPU) and the like including a combination of these. The electronic
device may be adapted to be mounted in the receptacle as illustrated in Figures 4 to 6.
[0032] The electronic device may be operably coupled to the processor 101 across a
system bus is a memory device 108. The memory device 108 may be configured for
storing digital data including computer program code instructions and associated program
data. During execution, the processor 101 retrieves computer code instructions and
computer program data from the memory 108 for execution. The memory 108 may also
include at least one multimedia file, a media file, a photograph, text file or any other
desired record.
[0033] The electronic device 100 may comprise a digital display 103 for the display of
digital data. A user interface touch controller 104 may be overlaid the display device 103
so as to allow for receipt of user interface haptic input. Optionally, the digital display
103 may be disposed on an outer surface of the receptacle. It will be appreciated that
while the device 100 may comprise a digital display, data may be sent to and received by
a user device. The user device may be a laptop, smart phone, a notebook, a tablet, a
computer, or any other electronic device adapted to display data to a user.
[0034] The electronic device 100 may comprise a wireless processor 105 for wireless
network connectivity and communication. In embodiments, the wireless processor 105 is

                                              -6
a wireless processor which may receive beacon broadcasts (such as BLE broadcasts).
Additionally the wireless processor 105 may comprise an 802.11 Wi-Fi or GSM data
processor for communicating across a data network. Other wireless communications may
be received and/or sent by the electronic device.
[0035] The electronic device 100 may comprise a power controller 106 for controlling
the power management of the electronic device 100. The power controller may also be
adapted to issue alerts to nearby devices regarding low power status or any other desired
power alert.
[0036] The electronic device 100 may further comprise a GPS processor 107 for
ascertaining the location of the electronic device 100. Other position location means may
be associated with the electronic device 100, such that the relative position of the device
can be known. This may be of particular advantage for public locations in which local
devices may wish to interact with the electronic device 100.
[0037] The electronic device 100 may further comprise image sensors 102 for the capture
of visual media. Image sensors may include cameras, video recording hardware, and
light detectors. These image sensors may capture and store data in the memory.
[0038] For illustrative convenience, the computer code instructions of the memory device
108 have been shown as having been divided into logical computer code instructions
modules.
[0039] Preferably, the computer code instructions modules may comprise a background
scanner controller module 110 for performing continuous wireless scanning as a
background process so as to be able to receive beacon broadcasts. Beacon broadcasts
may be transmitted by a user device (not shown). In one example, a smart phone, tablet
or computer is the user device.

                                             -7
[0040] Upon receipt of a beacon broadcast, the background scanner controller 110 may
be configured for identifying a beacon unique identifier (UID) 109 from the beacon
broadcast.
[0041] The modules may further comprise a query controller 111 configured for querying
a database of multimedia associated with the UID 109.
[0042] Furthermore, the modules may comprise a display controller 112 configured for
the display of any retrieved multimedia utilising the display device 103 or the display of
the user device.
[0043] Turning now to Figure 2, there is shown a multimedia beacon system 200. As is
shown, the system 200 comprises a plurality of wireless beacons 204, which
embodiments, take the form of BLE beacons. These wireless beacons 204 periodically
broadcast wireless beacon broadcasts, such as every 1OOms which may be received by the
electronic device 100. It will be appreciated that any predetermined period of time may
be used as the periodic broadcast time interval.
[0044] The electronic device 100 may be in operable communication with a hosted
database 201 across a data network 203 such as the Internet. In this way, multimedia
stored in the memory may be uploaded, downloaded or modified. This is of particular
advantage for public beacons which may be installed in statues or in locations which may
be difficult or not practical to access.
[0045] The data base 201 may comprise multimedia 202 stored in relation to a plurality
of wireless beacon UIDs 109. If the data base 201 is stored in multiple beacon UIDs 109,
the UIDs preferably communicate with each other such that data may be transferred
between UIDs to be provided to a user device, or displayed on a display screen.
[0046] As such, upon receipt of a wireless beacon broadcast, the electronic device 100 is
able to extract a UID therefrom and if the UID is an identified type of UID, the electronic
device 100 may query the database 201 for associated multimedia 202.

                                             -8
[0047] However, should no such associated multimedia 202 exist, the system 200 may
associate the UID 109 with the electronic device 100 so as to allow the electronic device
100 to upload multimedia 202 to the database 201 or associate existing multimedia with
the UID 109 which may then be retrieved by further electronic devices 100 in the usual
manner, which may be then transmitted to a user device.
[0048] Having described the above technical architecture, there will now be described
exemplary processing 300 of the system 200 with reference to Figure 3.
[0049] The electronic device 100 may execute a software application comprising the
aforedescribed background scanner controller 110, query controller 111 and display
controller 112.
[0050] Now, a plurality of consumer objects may be provided, each comprising a
wireless beacon 204 and associated power supply so as, for example, allow the wireless
beacon 204 to broadcast wireless beacons for several years.
[0051] In embodiments, only wireless beacons 204 having system-identifiable UIDs 109
are used to discriminate against other unrelated wireless beacons and avoid unnecessary
querying of the hosted database 201.
[0052] As such, these provided consumer objects and associated wireless beacons 204
periodically broadcast 301 wireless beacons as is shown in Figure 3.
[0053] Simultaneously, the background scanner controller 110 of the electronic device
100 continually scans 302 for wireless beacon broadcasts.
[0054] Upon receipt of a wireless beacon broadcast, the query controller 111 is
configured for identifying 303 a wireless beacon UID 109 from the broadcast.
[0055] In yet another embodiment, the query controller 111 may initially check whether
the received UID is a system UID so as to discriminate against other unrelated wireless

                                               -9
beacons. In this way, the unrelated UIDs may be disregarded and therefore the device is
less likely to be subject to abuse or security breaches. Further, the electronic device may
have at least one security means, such as encryption algorithms, cryptographic algorithms
or the like. In one embodiment, the security means is a disabled by the use of a private
key and a public key being hashed. The security hash may be any standard hashing
algorithm or any desired hashing algorithm to improve the security of the device and
reduce the potential for data breaches of the device. It will be appreciated that any other
desired software encryption or security means may be used such as; Triple DES, RSA,
Blowfish, Twofish, AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
[0056] For example, the beacon UIDs 109 employed by the system 200 may be restricted
to a particular range such that, should the query controller 111 identify that a received
wireless beacon UID 109 falls within this range, then the further functionality may be
invoked, else the UID is discarded. Alternatively, the wireless beacon broadcast may
comprise a data payload comprising a system identifier indicative of the present
application.
[0057] Discriminating the UID 109 in this manner avoids unnecessary network
communication between the electronic device 100 and the data base 201. Further,
avoiding additional communications may conserve battery power and therefore the
device may remain active for a longer period of time, before being recharged or a power
source being replaced.
[0058] If the query controller 111 determines that the received UID 109 is associated
with the system 200, the processing 300 may further comprise the electronic device 100
querying the hosted database 204 with the UID 109 across the data network 203.
[0059] Specifically, the database 201 is queried with the UID 109 to determine whether
there is any associated multimedia 202 stored in relation to the UID 109.
[0060] If a matching multimedia record is found, the processing 300 may comprise the
notification 305 of such utilising the display device 103 such as by way of on-screen

                                            -10
prompt or the like. The on-screen prompt may inform the user of the electronic device
that a proximate consumer product has been identified and that multimedia associated
with the consumer product is available for display. If confirmed by the user, the
electronic device 100 may retrieve 306 the related multimedia 202 from the database 204
and display 307 the multimedia utilising the display device 103.
[0061] Multimedia may be provided in differing formats, including text format, audio
format, image format, video format and the like.
[0062] Conversely, should no related multimedia 201 be found within the database 201 in
relation to the UID 109, a notification 305 may be displayed by the display device 103
that a proximate consumer device has been found without having associated multimedia.
[0063] As such, the users choosing, the UID 109 may be associated 310 with the
electronic device 100. Associating the electronic device 100 with the UID 109 may
comprise associating a user account ID with the UID 109. Specifically, during the initial
installation and execution of the software application, the user may be required to create a
user account having an associated user account UID. As such, by associating the UID
109 with the user account ID, the user may interact with the multimedia 202 associated
with the UID 109 utilising other electronic devices.
[0064] Having associated the electronic device 100 (or more specifically the user account
ID) with the UID 109, the processing 300 may further comprise the uploading or
associating 311 multimedia with the UID 109.
[0065] For example, utilising the electronic device 100, the user may upload various
multimedia, including by recording such in substantial real-time utilising the image
sensors 102, microphone (not shown) of the electronic device 100 and the like.
[0066] Such multimedia may be transmitted by the electronic device 100 across a data
network 203 to the database 201 for storage as the multimedia 202 in relation to the UID
109.

                                              -11
[0067] Alternatively, the user may have already recorded such multimedia within the
database 201 wherein, as opposed to uploading the multimedia as above, the existing
multimedia within the database 201 is associated with the UID 109.
[0068] As such, the system 200 may be adapted to allow users to view multimedia
associated with a wireless beacon, but also to upload such multimedia for wireless
beacons 204 which have not already been associated with multimedia so as to allow
further electronic devices 100 to subsequently view the uploaded multimedia.
[0069] Furthermore, in yet anotehr embodiment, the processing 300 may comprise a user
of the electronic device 100 further updating 312 the multimedia, such as at a later time.
In this manner, various multimedia 202 may be uploaded to the database 201 over time.
Such iteratively provided multimedia 272 may be time stamped so as to allow for time
period display thereof.
[0070] In another embodiment, processing 300 may comprise the sending of push
notification alerts to other associated electronic devices 100 upon the uploading,
association or updating of multimedia utilising the electronic device 100. Other
notifications may also be issued and location information from a device may be received
by the electronic device 100. A server push (push notification), may be issued via a
wireless communication means, and a request for a given transaction may be initiated by
the electronic device 100. Alternatively, the electronic device 100 may allow for a
pull/get, where the request for the transmission of information is initiated by the receiver
or client.
[0071] By way of example, for a first electronic device 100 having been associated 310
with a wireless beacon and having uploaded associated multimedia 202, for a further
electronic device 100 having retrieve the multimedia, the system 200 may make a record
of such retrieval by the further electronic device 100 such that any further updates to the
multimedia 202 by the first electronic device 100 will cause the system 200 to send a
push notification for/alert 308 to the further electronic device 100 indicative of the update

                                               -12
of the multimedia. Such updated multimedia may then be downloaded to the further
electronic device 100, or user device, for display and/or replay of audio.
[0072] In at least one embodiment, the multimedia 202 may be associated with date
availability metadata. For example, when uploading imagery, text, audio and the like, the
user of the electronic device 100 may additionally specify that such media is only
accessible after a certain date.
[0073] As such, for any further electronic device 100 having retrieved multimedia
utilising the beacon 204, the system 200 may the monitor the availability metadata such
that, at the time that a certain date as is specified by the availability metadata is reached,
the system 200 is able to send an electronic notification 309 to the further electronic
device 100 indicative of the availability of such further multimedia.
[0074] Referring to Figures 4 to 6 there is illustrated a receptacle 10 in which the
electronic device may be mounted. The receptacle 10 may be any predetermined shape,
but may be preferably any desired polyhedral with a predetermined number of faces 12.
Each of the faces 12 is preferably planar to allow for the receptacle to rest of any face 12.
However, any predetermined faces 12 may be formed with a non-planar face or be
formed with a texture. The shape or texture may provide for a tactile property or a visual
property to be imparted to the receptacle. In one embodiment, the receptacle 10 may be
an urn, a funerary urn or other receptacle which stores or houses ashes or another
particulate or fluid material. In yet another embodiment, the receptacle is a data
receptacle (or data depository) which can capture and store personal moments for later
viewing. In yet another embodiment, the data captured by the image sensor (if an image
sensor is provided) may be used to record interactions at a location, similar to that of a
nanny cam.
[0075] Any of the face(s) 12 of the receptacle 10 may be used as a base for the receptacle
to rest on a surface. However, it may be preferred that the base face 404 comprises an
access plate 16 which may be adapted to receive a power source, and/or the electronic

                                               -13
device 100. The access plate 16 may be any predetermined shape which is mountable in
an aperture (not shown) formed in the bottom face 14 of the receptacle 10.
[0076] The access plate 16 may have a seal or gasket on the side which mates with the
inside of the recess. The seal preferably prevents fluids from entering into the recess
holding the electronics. Securing apertures are preferably disposed on the access plate 16
which can receive a securing means to removably fix the access plate 16 to the bottom
face recess. The plate may have a depression or formation 20 which assists with
removing the access plate 16. Optionally, the securing means may be fixed with a
predetermined securing means which has a unique key or specialised head which receives
a star key, an allen key, a hex key, barrel key, or any other desired head shape.
[0077] The head 13 (also referred to as cap 13) of the receptacle is shown in Figures 4
and 5, and may be removably mounted thereon. The head 13 may be a seal or stopper
used to cover a chamber (not shown) of the receptacle 10. The chamber may be used to
store ashes, or any other desired material. Preferably, the chamber is provided with at
least one of; a hermetic seal, an air-tight seal and/or a fluid-tight seal. The head 13 may
have an engagement means and a corresponding engagement means is disposed on the
receptacle body 11. Together the head 13 and the receptacle body 11 may be used to
form a sealed receptacle 10. It will be appreciated that the receptacle may not be adapted
to receive an object or material, and may be ornamental, but may still have the electronic
device 100 installed therein. It will be appreciated that the receptacle 10 has a battery or
other power source, and may be charged or powered via conventional cords connected to
power outlets, or may be wirelessly rechargeable, or wirelessly powered.
[0078] The receptacle may be formed from at least one material selected from the
following group of; a metal, a polymer, a composite and an organic material. The metal
may be a pure metal, such as titanium, or may be a metal alloy. The polymer may be at
least one selected from the group of; phenol formaldehyde resin (Bakelite), neoprene,
