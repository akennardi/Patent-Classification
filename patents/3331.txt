10001] The present application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2014366217,
the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Australian Patent
Application No. 2014366217 is related to PCT Application No. PCT/US2014/070331, the content

BACKGROUND
[0002] The invention relates to a method and system for estimating the cost of constructing
a hydrocarbon fluid production and/or processing facility.
[0003] Complex construction and other capital cost estimation procedures are generally
required to assess investments required for planned hydrocarbon fluid production and/or
processing activities and to assess associated financial risks.
[0004] Aspentech offers an automated capital project estimating tool that reduces cost
estimating uncertainties by using a model-based approach.
[0005] US patent application US2012/0271673 discloses a system and method for offering
facility managers the ability to manage and track information, associated services and bids
from vendors for capital projects relating to the facilities.
10006] There is a need for further improvement of Capital Cost Estimating Tools (CCET) because
increasing global energy demand accelerates the pace of change in the oil and gas industry.
Regulatory rules and competitive landscapes are constantly in movement and new emerging
technologies are pushing the boundaries of what is physically possible. Furthermore, the demand
for mega-projects, both up- and downstream, is increasing rapidly. Achieving first quartile
performance in this dynamic environment is demanding. Making the right decisions fast and
accurate becomes evidently more important to retain a leading position in the industry. To achieve
project excellence a strong alignment is required amongst businesses. As part of corporate strategy
the up- and downstream project disciplines like planning and estimating have been merged.
[0007] Currently multiple estimating systems are used to create a single estimate. These
systems are operating using different estimating methodologies. Some are quantity based
and others are parametric. In addition, the type of detail differs between the various
systems.

SUMMARY
10008] It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least ameliorate one
or more of the above disadvantages.
10009] An aspect of the present disclosure provides an improved Capital Cost Estimating Tool

system using a single standardized approach and methodology.
[0010] In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a method

                                                    3
aggregate quantities of components, other materials and associated transportation, installation and
other labor, required to construct the facility and which database further comprises financial data
regarding the components, other materials and labor, which financial data include the estimated
cost for manufacturing or purchasing, transporting and installing the components and other

uncertainty, including inflation, allowances, market factors, taxes and contingencies; and
- providing a dashboard that presents to the user:

data derived from the engineering and procurement database; and
b) the associated financial uncertainty as a chance that the actual cost, in money of the day, for
constructing the facility will deviate from the presented cost estimate.
10013] Optionally, the database is configured to calculate the aggregate cost of the components,
materials and labor required to construct the facility in accordance with the following 14 steps:
1) estimate aggregate quantities of the components and equipment of the facility and of materials,
labor and construction equipment required to construct the facility;
2) update each aggregate quantity using a quantity allowance for each of the aggregate quantities;
3) further update each aggregate quantity by providing a loss factor for each of the aggregate
quantities;
4) estimate sourcing cost for each aggregate quantity, which sourcing cost estimate includes
application of a sourcing profile and a productivity factor that depends on geographic location of
the facility;
5) update the sourcing cost estimate using a location factor that depends on the geographic location
of the facility;
6) further update the sourcing cost estimate updated in accordance with step (5) for each of the
aggregate quantities using a sourcing cost allowance factor that depends on the geographic location
of the facility;
7) further update the sourcing cost estimate updated in accordance with step (6) by estimating cost
for transportation, tax and duties of each of components, materials and labor;
8) further update the sourcing cost estimate updated in accordance with step (7) using an estimated

11) further update the sourcing cost estimate updated in accordance with step (10) using an
estimated contingency factor;

                                                    4
12) further update the sourcing cost estimate updated in accordance with step (11)using an inflation
correction factor that is associated with the moment on which the cost are expected to be made;
13) further update the sourcing cost estimate updated in accordance with step (12) by accumulating
the sourcing cost estimates for all components, other materials and labor cost and expressing the
accumulated sourcing cost estimate in a reporting currency; and
14) inducing the dashboard to present to the user the accumulated sourcing cost estimate as the cost
estimate for constructing the facility updated in accordance with step (13) together with the
associated financial uncertainty.
10014] The associated financial uncertainty may be expressed as chance that the actual cost for
constructing the plant will deviate from the cost estimate, which chance is adjustable from 1%to
99%, and may in a default setting of the dashboard be set at about 50%.
10015] The hydrocarbon fluid production and/or processing facility may be an onshore or offshore
crude oil and/or natural gas production facility, comprising crude oil and/or natural gas production
wells and transportation pipelines, an oil refinery, a chemical plant in which hydrocarbon fluids are
converted into marketable chemical products or a natural gas processing facility, such as a Gas To
Liquids (GTL) production plant in which natural gas is converted into marketable liquid products
or a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) processing facility.
10016] Furthermore, the hydrocarbon fluid production and/or processing facility may comprise a
series of standard scalable components, such as pumps, vessels, pipelines, columns, columns,
support structures and power supply, safety and control systems of which the designs and cost
estimates are stored in the database and the engineering and procurement database may comprise a
scope tree with a Work Breakdown Schedule (WBS) that groups the hydrocarbon fluid processing
facility into the groups of onshore, offshore and deepwater hydrocarbon fluid processing facilities
and associated wells, pipelines and terminals and which groups the components into e.g.; hardware
items, system groups, equipment accessories, derived items, etc. The database may comprise a user
interface which allows a user to generate a design of the hydrocarbon fluid production and/or
processing facility by selecting in the database components which the user identifies to be suitable
for a given flux, composition, pressure and/or other physical characteristics of the hydrocarbon
fluid to be processed in the facility.
10017] Optionally the hydrocarbon fluid production and/or processing facility is constructed if the
cost estimate does not exceed a selected limit.
This limit may be determined by envisaged economic benefits from exploitation of the processing
facility.
10018] In accordance with the invention there is furthermore provided a system for performing the
method according to the invention, which the system comprises a computer readable medium,

which when connected to a computer, causes the computer to execute the method according to the
invention.
10019] These and other features, embodiments and advantages of the method and/or system
according to the invention are described in the accompanying claims, abstract and the following
detailed description of non-limiting embodiments depicted in the accompanying drawings, in which

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DEPICTED EMBODIMENTS
10027] Achieving first quartile performance in the current oil and gas industrial environment is
challenging. The ability to make the right decision fast and accurate in the early phases of a project
becomes evidently more important. The Capital Cost Estimating Tool (CCET) according to the
present invention is capable of providing project estimates even when minimal information is
known. By means of mathematical models describing engineering scope, quantities are calculated.
A framework for cost calculations provides an end-to-end approach to estimate project cost.
10028] The CCET according to the invention provides the following benefits:
V        Cost consistency throughout the project funnel
         Better ranking of project portfolio
         Improvement in cost estimating performance
P235302D1_13949543_1

                                               6
         Higher productivity in estimate generation
         Better benchmarking capabilities
[0029] Cost estimating is the calculated approximation of cost which is usable even if
input data may be incomplete or uncertain. Estimating in a construction engineering
context describes the process of forecasting the total cost of the engineering project taking
into account various factors amongst:
-        Scope uncertainties
-        Location influences
-        World market conditions
-        Project schedule
-        Project management.
[0030] The estimated cost can encourage investment in the project if the cost is
economically acceptable. Since a decision to invest is not an instance based decision,
several iterations are required in which both scope and estimated cost are further refined.
The process of maturing business opportunities from initial idea to value realisation is
shaped in an over-arching framework. The framework divides the realisation of a business
opportunity into logical phases. A decision gate punctuates each phase and decisions drive
all activities and deliverables.
[0031] Table 1 provides an overview of four phases of project development currently
identified. The accuracy of the project cost estimate increases with each subsequent phase
as scope definition improves and assumptions are reduced. The estimate type indicator
shows implicitly the maturity of the project in terms of scope definitions and the quality of
engineering data available.

[0032] Typically an estimate will progress from a Type 0 to a Type 4 estimate as
alternatives are discarded and more information becomes available.
[0033] The CCET system and method according to the invention are currently capable of
providing Type 0 - Type 3 estimates whereas Type 4 is still under development.
a.       The CCET system according to the invention, also abbreviated as CCET is a quantity based
estimating system.
b.       By means of scope input quantities are calculated which are priced to generate estimate
cost. The high level process from scope to cost in CCET is depicted in Figure 1.
10034] The approach to calculate estimated cost is identical for every Type 0-3 assuring
consistency of the estimate over the various phases. The CCET system according to the invention
works on the basis that early in the project design not all scope components are known in detail.
The CCET system according to the invention solves this by generating a complete detailed scope
by means of mathematical models pre-set with best-practice default values. Estimated cost only
changes when new scope information becomes available and scope is added or changed and initial
pre-set default values are replaced with actual values. Changing the estimate Type has no effect on
estimated cost because the flow of calculations and the mathematic models in place remain
identical.
[0035] In the following paragraphs four subsequent steps I-IV to come from input scope to
cost are described.
I. Input Scope
10036] Creating an estimate in CCET starts with the definition of the project. This includes
locations of construct (sourcing), project environment or any special conditions applicable.
Secondly scope input is required. Since CCET is designed to be the single source of estimates for
capital expenditure it covers the full range of scope required in the oil and gas industry. At the
highest level the following scope is covered in CCET:
-        Process facilities on- and offshore
-        Pipelines
-        Wells
-        Substructures floating and fixed
P235302D1_13949543_1

                                                   8
-       Deepwater
-       Terminals
10037] These scope items are further differentiated in smaller scope items and are eventually
providing the differentiation in scope and cost elements required for Type 3 estimates.
II. Estimate Scope
10038] CCET facilitates the generation of a complete detailed scope by means of mathematical
models logically connecting scope items, making it easier and faster for the user to create an
estimate.
10039] In general there are two distinct types of models in CCET:
-       Cost engineering models (EM)
A set of algorithms that describe the mapping of input variables to output variables of a
specific piece of scope. Some output variables are quantities.
-       Configuration models (CM)
A configurationmodel describes relations between engineeringmodels.
10040] Figure 2 illustrates the connection between cost engineering and configuration models
which together form the model landscape of CCET covering all types of scope required in the oil
and gas industry.
10041] To logically constrain the ordering of scope in CCET a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
has been brought into place.
10042] The levels of the WBS are shown in Figure 3.
10043] The top level in the WBS shown in Figure 3 is the hardware item level (HI). As an
example, the hardware item level represents an entire offshore production facility with the
following underlying scope breakdown:
-        SG: gas separation
-        S: gas compression
-       E: compressors
-       DI: structural steel
10044] The WBS is a logical hierarchy of scope in an oil and gas engineering project and acts as a
backbone on the model landscape. By means of configuration models the CCET system constructs
a scope tree out of cost engineering models thereby defining pieces of the project scope. Figure 4
shows the hierarchical CCET scope tree which is defined by means of connected engineering
models over the WBS structure. At any level the user is allowed to influence the scope making
CCET very flexible.

                                                    9
III. Quantities
[00451 At any level in the WBS structure, cost engineering models are calculating quantities for a
base project location. In CCET a quantity is used to refer to any type of quantitative properties of a
cost element. Some examples on quantity items:
-        Man-hours electrical labor
-        Weight stainless steel pipe 8 inch (~ 20 cm diameter)
[00461 A quantity item has a Unit of Measurement in which the quantity is expressed. The
specifications of the quantity are called qualifiers and are important for price determination.
[00471 Within CCET every quantity is connected to the CCET Cost Breakdown Structure (CBS)
which provides adequate detailing for Type 3 estimating. By means of the CBS coding system
quantity allowances and adjustments are applied on the quantities in a flexible and standardized
approach. Both the allowances and adjustment factors are depending on location settings of the
project defined during estimate creation.
[00481 A major benefit of quantity based estimating is that the calculated quantities provide a
transparent basis for benchmarking versus internal / external KPI's of estimated project scope.
Estimated quantities are used in comparison with contractor proposals, schedules, risk profiles and
cost control (management).
IV. Cost
[00491 The quantity amount and governing qualifiers determine the cost of the quantity by means
of a unit rate. The unit rate is the price for a certain amount of the quantity and qualifier
combinations. This price is valid in a base reference location, expressed for an applicable currency
and date. Multiplication of all quantities and their governing unit rates results in identified cost at
standard location expressed in a single currency. Hereafter by means of the CBS; identical to the
quantity allowances; cost allowances are applied.
[00501 Location settings are used to change perspective from standard location to the locations of
construction and implementation. Depending on the execution strategy of the project this results in
a multi-currency estimate.
[00511 The unit rates in CCET are kept up-to-date by means of an indexation and feedback
strategy taking into account volatile components of nowadays market.            Indexation models are
utilised to enable incorporations of direct market intelligence (normalised cost data for bulk
materials, commodities and construction equipment) and / or more generic cost indexes.
[00521 All location settings in CCET are captured in a tabular format providing transformation of
quantities and cost from standard location to project locations. This table is created on estimate
P235302D113949543_1

                                                  10
initiation and is pre-filled with default values applicable for the selected countries and regions.
When required, the estimator is able to overwrite these default values with project related values.
Amongst the location settings are:
-         Source of equipment and bulk materials split by region or country
-         Duties and handling charges, transport insurance and freight
-         Labor / staff rates (direct and indirect) based on crew compositions
-         Indirect cost ratios (supervision, profits, erection equipment, sundries, local
expenses, temporarily facilities, scaffolding)
-         Labor / staff productivities
-         Location cost factor (generic cost ratio's)
10053] By means of location surveys and benchmarking the default location settings are kept up
to-date.
10054] To effectively capture and re-use the knowledge and quality put into place by the estimator
when creating an estimate, CCET uses the concept of library items. A library item is effectively a
hardware item, system group or a system, which has re-usable and assured scope. A library item is
kept in a separate repository and can be used by the estimator as a quick start instead of starting
from scratch. The user can modify the scope of the library item as required by overwriting scope
values and by applying scaling rules. The decision of constructing an estimate from scratch or
using library items is entirely up to the CCET user.
10055] CCET is designed as an end-to-end system meaning all calculation routines and options to
create a capital cost estimate are included, amongst:
-         Market Factor integration
Incorporating the flexibility to cover future market movements.
-         Contingencies
Covering cost for changes as a result of further definition and variations emerging in the
subsequent phases. Contingency values are determined by a risk module fully integrated in
CCET.
-         Inflation and Phasing
Uplifting the estimated cost by taking into account Rate of Exchange variations of
currencies of spend and local country inflation rates in the phasing of cost.
-         Purchase Orders
Application of PO orders for either individual scope items or bulk materials.
-         Overwrites
P235302D1_13949543_1

                                                  11
A significant number of outputs calculated by the engineering models or intermediate cost
results can be overwritten allowing the user full control of the calculated quantities and
cost.
-        Scaling
Scaling is a general term for re-defining an already completed scope by changing one or
more of the key properties. An example of scaling may be the changing of the throughput
of a particular process configuration
-        Import features
Various import features for data exchange purposes like equipment and process parameters
and upload of base financial information like exchange rates, inflation numbers and market
factors.
[00561 CCET being an end-to-end system minimizes the need for additional compilations and
assures quality, consistency of the estimate.
[00571 CCET is facilitating the maturing and detailing of a project. The approach to calculate
estimated cost is identical for every project phase assuring consistency of the estimate over the
various phases. CCET works on the basis that early in the project design phase not all scope
components are known in detail. CCET facilitates the generation of a complete scope by means of
mathematical models, calculating all required scope quantities. Costs are calculated by means of
applying unit rates. Location settings allow estimation of projects all over the globe.
[00581 Being and end-to-end system CCET provides the ability to adequately respond to today's
project and economical environment.
[00591 Figure 5 shows the 14 steps of CCET to estimate cost of mechanical labor required to build
a hydrocarbon processing facility.
[00601 Figure 6 shows the 14 steps of CCET to estimate cost of mechanical labor required to build
a hydrocarbon processing facility.
[00611 Details of the 14 steps of CCET shown in Figure 6 are described in more detail below.
Step 1: Aggregate Quantities
In step 1 of CCET all quantity information is gathered and aggregated.
Table 2 gives all necessary input for this step.

[00621 All quantities are aggregated on CBS (NORSOK) code level. The quantities are based on
these CBS (NORSOK) codes, divided in CBS (NORSOK) groups. Only similar CBS (NORSOK)
codes can be added up to a single quantity; like mechanical labor (50 hours + 100 hours + 10
hours).
[00631 Labor related quantity contains an additional calculation; each quantity is multiplied with a
location productivity factor. This factor accounts for the difference in productivity between various
parts of the world. For example, when certain labor takes place at locations with high temperatures,
productivity will be less than for locations with lower temperatures.

[00651 Assuming the productivity rates provided by Table 3A are correct, the calculation for the
Netherlands will be as follows: 500 hrs * 1,05 = 525 hrs
[00661 Calculations for non-labor related quantities, will not be multiplied with a productivity
factor (or this factor is always equal to 1).
[00671 Columns and piping, while having a different unit rate will have to be listed separately.
[00681 After step 5 (where quantities are multiplied with their unit rate) all costs can be aggregated
per CBS group.
[00691 Table 3B gives an example of the level on which quantities can be aggregated for columns.
In this example Carbon steel columns have a different unit rate (cost curve) than Stainless steel and
Alloy columns. Therefore these groups cannot be aggregated, before step 5, where the quantities
are translated to costs.

[00711 After all quantities are aggregated, the user has the option to change the value of the
quantities, or the value of the primary qualifier, when this is defined for a certain quantity. This
leads to the final quantities and primary qualifiers, which will be used in step 2.
Step 2: Quantity allowances
[00721 In step 2 quantity allowances are added to each quantity or primary qualifier. Necessary
input for this step is given by Table 3D.

         Implementation Method                        Stick build            Modular
[00731 As indicated before, there are three categories I-III of quantity allowances:
P235302D113949543_1

                                                  14
I)       Base Quantity Allowance: a factor used for indicating the difference between the
Base Quantities that results from step 1 (Aggregated Quantities) and the quantity
including:
- MTO Allowance: this covers materials that are usually not shown on drawings or
specifically defined at the time the estimate is prepared. Examples are minor utility piping,
steel gusset plates, etc.
- Development Design Allowance: this covers equipment adjustments that occur through
the normal evolution of engineering, i.e. from initial diagrams, layouts and specifications
to final design. Examples are changes to design details, nozzles and manholes, locations,
clips, etc.
These allowances depend on the estimate type. A type 1 estimate will receive a higher
quantity allowance than a type 2 estimate.
II)      Implementation method quantity allowance: a factor used for adding additional
quantities in case the implementation method is Modular. This reflects the fact that the
CEM's do not incorporate this. This allowance therefore depends on whether the
implementation method is stick build or modular.
III)     Project execution strategy quantity allowance: a factor used for adding quantities
in case the project execution strategy calls for this. Also, this reflects the fact that the
CEM's do not incorporate this. The allowances depends on the whether the project
execution strategy is greenfield or brownfield.
10074] These last two allowances are added because both implementation method and project
execution strategy might have an impact on: integrity of existing facilities / utilities, life cycle cost
for existing main equipment, reuse of existing equipment and materials, correctness of existing
drawings, disruption of operating units, timing / scheduling consequences, Risks, HSSE, etc.
[0075 FurtherCalculationsof step 2:
Each of the three allowances is added to the quantity or primary qualifier.
Table 3E gives an example of quantity allowances which may be used for Carbon Steel
Columns.

[00761 The group Carbon steel has a primary qualifier of 3000 kg. Quantity allowances will
therefore be added to the primary qualifier instead of the quantity. If the user has indicated that the
Estimate type is type 1, the implementation method is stick build and the project execution strategy
is greenfield, the quantity including quantity allowance will be calculated as follows:
3.000 kg*(1OX%)*(1OY%)*(1OZ%)                     =   3.000 kg*1OQ%                   =   3.XYZ kg.
For step 2 equals the cost calculation for non-labor related quantities to the labor related
quantities.
Step 3: Loss factors
[00771 In step 3 quantities are adjusted based on construction location depended loss. Input for
step 3 is given by:
                                                        Input step 3
                                             Construction location
[00781 The construction location dependent loss is designed to translate installed (or nett)
quantities to purchased (gross) quantities. Construction dependent loss includes weather downtime,
theft, etc. For some bulk materials an extra allowance is added: cut and waste allowance.
[0079] Further calculations of step 3 are described below.

                                                    16
[00801 Table 3F gives an example of cut & waste allowances and loss factors which may be used
for pipework. Assume that the amount of pipework equals 2000 kg. If the user has indicated that
the construction location is the Netherlands, the calculations for step 3 will look as follows:
2000 kg*(102%)*(101%) = 2000 kg *105% = 2101 kg.
[00811 For quantities which do not require cut and waste allowance, the cut & waste allowance
will be 0%. Step 3 is not necessary for labor related quantities. All percentages can be set to 0% for
these quantities.
Step 4: Sourcingprofile and productivity
[00821 For every construction location there is a default sourcing profile. This profile assigns
which percentage of cost of each quantity. The sourcing location is the location where certain
quantities are purchased, or where certain labor takes place, in case of labor related quantities.
Input for step 4a (Sourcing) is given in Table 3G.
                                                Table 3G

                                       EFA Applicable
[00831 As stated before for Enterprise Framework Agreements(EFA) there will be a separate
profile.
If EFA Applicable has the value 'yes' for a certain Hardware Item Group, the EFA sourcing profile
will be used instead of the construction location sourcing profile, for all quantities part of this
Hardware Item.
[00841 Because step 4 divides quantities per location, all further calculation will have to be done
per location.
Step 5: Cost at location
[00851 In step 5 all quantities are translated to cost. For all CBS group cost curves are defined,
which map the unit rate (cost/uom quantity) against the uom of the quantity. As stated before, each
quantity has a base cost curve (unit rate), dated on the EDM date: 1 July 2011. This cost curve is
related to a base location. Per quantity is for each sourcing location a cost at location factor defined,
to translate the base cost curve to the sourcing location cost curve. Because cost curves are given
P235302D113949543_1

                                                   17
in the local currency, exchange rates are necessary to set the curves to the correct currency. Input
for step 5 is given by:
                                              Input step 5
                                      Sourcing locations
[00861 At the end of step 5 is each quantity per sourcing location is multiplied with its cost rate,
resulting in cost per quantity per location.
[0087] Further calculations of step 5 are described below.
[00881
[00891
[00901 Table 3 H gives all information gathered from previous steps, necessary for step 5.
There are 3 columns, with an adjusted weight of 3.309 kg. The sourcing profile states that 25 % of
column cost is related to Italy, 50% to the Netherlands and the last 25% to Malaysia.

[00911 In step 4 it is determined that the total weight of columns is divided over the sourcing
locations.
[00921
[00931 Table 31 gives these results for the example.
                      Table 31: Quantities Columns per sourcing location
       3*X%*3.309 kg =A kg                 3*Y%*3.309 kg =B kg               3*Z%*3.309 kg =C kg

[00941 These are not the weights that should be used to determine cost per kg for columns,
because this is not the actual weight of the column. This weight is given by the value of the primary
qualifier after step 3 (i.e. 3309 kg).
[00951 Assume that the base location for columns is Italy. The base cost curve for columns in
Euro/mT is given by the following formula:
y = 56,913x - 1104,7x + 6457,1
[00961 Table 3J gives all further information necessary to determine cost curves for the
Netherlands and Malaysia, and to give a view of these in both local currency and USD dollar.

[00971 To determine the cost per location the following calculations are necessary:
Cost/mT Italy     =  56,913*(3.309/1.000)2     -  1104,7*(3.309/1.000)+ d =
e euro/mT
Cost/mT Netherlands= 62,604*(3.309/1.000)2-            1215,1*(3.309/1.000)+ f = g euro/mT
Cost/mT Malaysia = 99,841(3.390/1.000)2 - 1937,9*(3.309/1.000) + h =j MYR/mT
Total cost Italy =                  2,482 mT * e euro/mT = k euro
Total cost Netherlands =            4,964 mT * g euro/mT = 1 euro
Total cost Malaysia =               2,482 mT * j MYR/mT = m MYR
[00981 Because the primary qualifier has UOM kilogram, and the cost is given in metric tonnes,
the value 3.309 needs to be divided by 1.000.
P235302D113949543_1

                                                    19
[00991 The cost of a column depends on the weight of a column. As indicated earlier, the
cost/UOM quantity for several other quantities depend on the value of the quantity (or primary
qualifier). But there are also quantities where the cost/UOM quantity may be independent of the
value of the quantity, for example, mechanical labor. For generality these cost are also given by a
curve, but this has a constant value. For example, if at location the Netherlands 450 hours of
mechanical labor takes place, and the cost of this labor is given by 55 euro/hr, the cost calculation
will be straightforward:
450 hr * 55 euro/hr = 24.750 euro.
Step 6: Cost allowances
[001001 As noted before, is step 6, cost allowances, similar to step 2, quantity allowances. Both
steps require the same input as illustrated in table 3K.

        Implementation Method                 Stick build           Modular
[001011 The cost allowances are also divided in three categories:
IV)      Base cost allowances: this factor indicates that the cost in reality will differ from
the calculated cost.
V)       Implementation method cost allowances: this factor adds cost in case the
implementation method is Modular. This reflects the fact that the CEM's do not incorporate
this.
VI)      Project execution strategy cost allowances:             this factor adds cost in case the
project execution strategy calls for this. This reflects the fact that the CEM's do not
incorporate this.

                                                   20
The calculations in this step are also similar to the calculations in step 2. An example of
these calculations can, therefore, be found in section
Further Calculations of step 2'.
Step 7: Transportationand duties
[00991 Each CBS Group that needs to be transported from its sourcing location to the construction
location receives additional transportation costs. These costs depend on the weight of the quantity
and on the distance between the sourcing location and the construction location. Necessary input
for step 6 can be found in table 3L.
                                              Table 3L

                                       Weight quantity
[001001 A transportation cost curve is determined based on historical project data, and is given in
USD at the EDM date. As mentioned earlier, a distance table is necessary to determine the distance
between sourcing and construction location. After calculating the transportation costs, these are
converted from USD to the local currency of the sourcing location.
[001011 Since labor takes place at the sourcing location, no additional transportation costs are
calculated, for labor related quantities.
[001021 Duties apply to both labor and non-labor related quantities. For each quantity, an additional
percentage is added to the costs.
[001031           Further calculations for step 7 are described below.
[001041 Continuing the example of the previous section, transportation costs for columns from
Malaysia will be calculated. The distance table indicates that Malaysia lies approximately 15.000
km from the Netherlands.
[001051 The amount of columns transported from here is 2,482 mT
(see Table 31). Transportation costs are:
  -0,65 ln(15.000) + 6,5 = 0,25 USD/km/mT
[001061 This brings the total transportation cost on
P235302D113949543_1

                                                   21
0,25 USD/km/mT*15.000km*2,482 mT= 9.308 USD= 28.175 MYR
[001071 Duties apply to the costs which are the result of step 6.
Assume that the columns which are procured in Malaysia cost 160.400 MYR after step 6, and that
duties are 5% if columns are brought from Malaysia to the Netherlands.
Total cost including duties will then become:
160.400 MYR * 105% = 170.220 MYR.
Total cost after step 7 will be:
28.175 MYR + 170.220MYR = 198.404MYR.
Step 8: Cost Phasing
[001081 Step 9 phases the cost per sourcing locations over the years by means of a phasing profile
(S-Curve). This profile specifies how much of the cost will be incurred between the start date and
end date of the activity. Each hardware item will be using the same S-curve. Generally there are
different S-curves for Engineering, Procurement and Construction. The user can indicate the
phasing profile that should be used. If the user does not indicate this, the default phasing profile
will be used. Necessary input for this step is given by Table 3M.

Let a phasing profile be selected by the user. Three S-curves given in percentages may be

After step 8 costs will be divided per location, and for each location they will be divided
per monthly period.
Step 9: Market Outlook
[00111] Market escalation is the increase in costs in real terms (i.e. cost increase over and above
inflation). This escalation is for the specific purpose of producing estimates for economic analysis,
business planning and portfolio analyses and reflect the expected market movements within the oil
and gas capital project industry. The market outlook document is published annually and is based
on Shell scenarios. The current scenarios are referred to as SV (Screening Value), RV (Ranking
Value) and HV (High Value).
[001121 All costs need to be escalated from the EDM date (1-7-2011) to period the amount is
spend.
Steps 10 & 11: Contingency and tenderingadjustment
[00113] With TECOP (Technical, Economic, Commercial, Organisational,
(Socio-)Political) Deterministic Risk Analysis the contingency of a project is determined. Because
the calculations of the tendering adjustment require similar inputs, these steps will be combined.
Input will either be determined in previous steps; or added by the user. For example the
construction location, project execution strategy, and tendering adjustment period could provide
input for several topics of the TECOP and tendering adjustment table.

A. Step 12: Inflation
[001141 In step 12 inflation is taken into account. The inflation depends on the sourcing location
and the phasing profile.
