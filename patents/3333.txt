CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]        This       application             is    a   divisional              application
of Australian application number 2014271335, the entire
disclosure          of       which         is         incorporated                  herein           by
reference.
BACKGROUND OF         THE     INVENTION
[0002]        The present invention relates to the field of
mining    machines.             Specifically,               the      present           invention
relates     to      a     dipper         door        and       a    dipper           door        trip
assembly on a mining machine, such as a rope shovel.
[0003]        Industrial            mining         machines,           such        as    electric
rope  or    power         shovels,         draglines,             etc.,         are       used       to
execute    digging          operations             to    remove         material             from       a
bank   of   a    mine.            On     a    conventional                rope        shovel,          a
dipper    is     attached           to     a    handle,           and      the       dipper          is
supported     by a       cable,       or     rope,       that      passes          over       a  boom
sheave.         The       rope       is      secured           to     a      bail        that        is
pivotably      coupled         to    the      dipper.            The     handle          is     moved
along   a   saddle         block        to     maneuver           a     position             of    the
dipper.     During a hoist phase, the rope is reeled in by
a  winch   in     a    base      of    the      machine,          lifting           the       dipper
upward through the bank and liberating the material to
be dug.
[0004]        To     release         the      material           disposed           within         the
dipper,    a     dipper         door        is      pivotally            coupled            to     the
dipper.       When       not      latched          to    the      dipper,           the       dipper
door  pivots       away       from a        bottom of            the      dipper,           thereby
freeing    the        material           out        through         a      bottom           of     the
dipper.         Current           shovels            use      a     dipper           door        trip
mechanism      to    unlatch         and      release         the      dipper         door       from
                                                                        10229216_1  (GHMatters) P98789.AU.1

                                               -    2
the dipper.                The     dipper door trip mechanism includes a
latch        bar that         is     moved in       and out           of    an     opening          in     a
latch keeper on the dipper.                            Movement of the latch bar
generates           significant           amounts         of     friction           and      wear       on
surfaces of the latch bar and latch keeper as the latch
bar      slides         in     and      out   of     the       latch         keeper.              Thus,
current          dipper          door     trip      mechanisms                employ          use       of
expensive, exotic, high strength materials on the latch
bar     and/or         latch        keeper    to     try       and      withstand            some       of
the high amounts of friction and wear.

dipper          door       75.         In     some     constructions                the     upper        link
arm 135 is pivotally coupled to the dipper door 75.
[0024]                With      continued             reference             to     FIGS.       2    and      3,
the linkage assembly                          130 includes              a connecting rod 140

the latch bar 150.                      The       latch keeper 160                     is coupled to
the       dipper          70,        and       includes              an       opening             165       for
receiving the latch bar 150.                                  The latch keeper 160 is a
separate,            removable,             and         replaceable              element            on      the
machine         10,       although          in       some       constructions                  the      latch
keeper 160 is integrally formed with the dipper 70.

latch       keeper        160   and      free        the      dipper       door        75     from the
dipper 70,            the trip motor 120 is activated.                                   Activation
of the trip motor 120                     causes movement of the lever bar
145,       which pulls the latch bar 150 away                                   from the latch
keeper        160.        As   the      latch          bar      150    is    moved         away      from
the latch keeper                160,      the end 175 of the latch bar 150
slides          along        the        roller             170.            The         roller          170
facilitates             a    low-friction,                  sliding         movement             of    the
latch       bar      150,    making        it      easier         to   pull      the       latch       bar
50       away    from      the      latch          keeper         160     than        without          the
roller        170.       Without        the       roller         170,     the     latch         bar    150
would       rub      against      and      frictionally                engage         one      or    more
inner        surfaces         in      the        latch         keeper        160,        generating
significant            amounts         of      friction            and wear          on      both      the
latch       bar      150    and the         latch         keeper       160,       and       requiring
significant            more     activation               force       from the           trip       motor
120       to   pull       the     latch          bar       150      away       from       the      latch
keeper         160.         Additionally,                  without          the       roller         170,
mechanical            stresses on the latch bar 150 would increase
exponentially as the latch bar 150 is pulled out of the
latch       keeper        160,      due       to      the      constant          weight          of    the
material          in    the    dipper           70     pressing         down       on      the     latch
bar       150   and     the    decreasing               area       of   frictional              contact
between the latch bar                     150 and the                surface of the latch
keeper        160      upon     which          the       latch       bar       150      is      rubbing
across.
                                                                            10229216_1  (GHMatters) P98789.AU.1

 [0032]            Use       of     the       roller          170     eliminates            significant
amounts         of     friction            and wear              on   the     latch        bar     150       and
the      latch       keeper           160,        and        eliminates           the       exponential
increase          in     mechanical                stresses           described           above.             The
roller         170     provides             a    low       friction         rolling           surface          as
the latch bar 150 is removed from the latch keeper 160.
The      roller          170       reduces            friction            and      wear,        and       also
alleviates              or       reduces             the         need      for       expensive               and
exotic, high-strength materials to be used in the latch
bar     150      (e.g.,         in      the      insert          180)     or    the      latch        keeper
160.
 [0033]            FIG.        5     illustrates                 another        dipper         door       trip
assembly 215 for unlatching the dipper door 75 from the
dipper 70.               As with the dipper                         door trip assembly 115,
the dipper            door trip assembly 215                             also includes a                  trip
motor 220            (illustrated schematically in FIG. 5) powered
by     an     electrical               power          source          225      (also        illustrated
schematically in FIG. 5) with its own motor controller.
The trip motor 220                       and the electrical power source 225
are located, for example, along the handle                                                85,     the boom
35,     the     frame        30,       or other             locations          on the         shovel         10.
In     some     constructions                   the       trip      motor       220     is     driven          in
response           to       control              signals            sent       from         a     remotely
located controller on the shovel 10.
 [0034]            With        reference                to      FIG.      5,     the      dipper          door
trip        assembly            215        includes               a   linkage           assembly             230
coupled         to      the      trip        motor          220.         The     linkage          assembly
230      is    disposed             at     least          partially          within          the      dipper
door 70,          and includes an                     upper link arm 235 coupled to
the     trip       motor         220       (e.g.,           with      a   rope,        chain,         etc.).
The      upper        link         arm       235       is      pivotally           coupled           to      the
dipper door 75 at a pivot point 238.

 [0036]               The       link      member          243         includes            a    stop       member
248.          The       stop member              248      is      a     wedge       or      other       similar
structure              that       engages         and       contacts              an    inner        wall       249
of      the      dipper            door       75    in       a      first,          latched           position

inner wall 249 in a second, unlatched position.
 [0037]              With         reference           to       FIG.          5,    the       link       members
242,        243,        244       are      coupled           to       a     latch       bar       250.          The
latch bar 250 is                      disposed partially within a                                   latch bar
housing 255 that receives                               and guides the latch bar 250
as the latch bar 250 moves.                                     The latch bar housing 255
is       disposed             within           the      dipper              door        75.           In      some
constructions                  the     latch        bar housing                  255     includes           guide

[0039]              As    illustrated             in      FIG.       5,   the       latch        bar      250
and     the     latch         bar     housing          255      are      angled         at     an     angle
257 relative to the inner wall 249, such that the latch
bar 250 is biased toward a position away from the latch
keeper          160      and        the       roller           170        (i.e.,           toward           an
unlatched position).
[0040]              In    the       latched          position            (as     illustrated                in
FIG.      5),      the     latch       bar     250       is    engaged         with        the      roller
170     and     is     disposed          within         the      latch       keeper          160,       such
that       the       dipper         door      75      is      locked         relative             to      the
dipper        70.       In     the      latched          position,           the       link       members
243,      244      are     angled        toward         one      another,           such       that       the
stopper         member         248     engages           the      inner       wall        249      of     the
dipper door 75,                 and provides a wedging force that helps
to     keep       the       link      members            243,       244      locked           in      their
angled position.
[0041]              To    release          the      wedge         force,        the       trip        motor
220     is     activated.                Activation              of     the     trip        motor         220
causes movement of the upper link arm 235,                                             which causes
movement          of    the       connecting             rod      240.         Movement            of     the
connecting rod 240                    causes movement                   of the link members
(e.g.,        pivoting           of    the     link        members         243,        244      relative

the inner wall                 249, thereby allowing the                             latch bar 250
to slide           down and away               from the latch                  keeper          160.         In
some constructions one or more ends of the link members
242,      243,       244 are         fixed within the dipper door 75.                                       In
some      constructions               the     link        members         242,        243,        244     all

 [0042]            As      discussed             above,          the        latch         bar        250       is
naturally biased away from the                                   latch keeper 160                     due to
the orientation                of the latch bar                      250 within the                   dipper
door       75.       Thus,       the       activation             force        required             to    pull
the      latch       bar     250       away        from       the      latch         keeper          160       is
reduced          as     compared            to     a    latch        bar       250       that        is     not
orientated             and     naturally               biased         away        from        the       latch
keeper 160.
 [0043]            While       the       illustrated              construction                 in     FIG.        5
utilizes          link      members           242,       243,      244      and       a    stop       member
248      to    help      inhibit           the       biased,         angled          latch         bar      250
from       sliding         away        in      the      latched          position,               in     other
constructions different structures,                                       such as pins, cams,
plungers,            etc.      may         be      used        to     inhibit             the       biased,
angled latch bar 250                       from sliding away.
 [0044]             FIG.      6    illustrates                 a     latch        bar        350       and       a
latch        bar     housing          355       for      use      in     a    dipper           door       trip
assembly          such      as dipper            door       trip       assemblies               115,      215.
The      latch bar          350     includes an                end 375 that is disposed
within        the     latch       keeper          160      (illustrated                schematically
in     FIG.      6).        The     end       375      includes           a    flat        portion           376
and      a    tapered        portion             377      adjacent            the       flat        portion
376.        The end 375 engages the roller 170 when the latch
bar 350 is in a latched position                                    (i.e., when the dipper
door 75 is locked relative to the dipper 70).                                                     When the
latch bar 350 has been pulled a certain distance out of
the latch keeper 160 from the latched position, the end
375 becomes biased away from the latch keeper 160.                                                          For
example,          when      the      trip       motor         120      (or      other         activation
force)        begins        to pull           the      latch       bar       350      away        from      the

contact          with        the     flat       portion            376.           The      flat        portion
276       slides        along       the      roller          170,        until         the      roller         170
reaches           a     transition              point         378         (in       the       illustrated

When        the     roller        170       reaches          the       transition               point        378,

tapered          portion           377,        in      conjunction                 with        the       roller
170,       pushes         and biases the                 latch bar 350                    away from the
latch         keeper         160.         The      tapered            portion            377      makes        the
activation               force        (e.g.,        from         trip        motor          120       or     220)
less than that which would otherwise be needed to pull
the latch bar 350 away from the latch keeper 160 if the
latch bar 350 did not include the tapered portion 377.
