                         SENSOR ASSEMBLY AND METHOD
                    FOR MEASURING FORCES AND TORQUES
         [0001]          The entire contents of U.S. Provisional Patent Application
No. 61/777,596, filed on March 12, 2013, and the complete specification of Australian
Patent Application No. 2014249548 as originally filed and as accepted are hereby
incorporated by reference.
         [0002]          The disclosure relates generally to a force/torque sensor assembly
and a method for measuring forces and torques. In some embodiments, the force/torque
sensor assembly and method are employed in a robotic system comprising an instrument
and a manipulator used to position the instrument.
         [0003]          Medical practitioners have found it useful to use robotic systems to
assist in the performance of surgical procedures. Such robotic systems typically include a
manipulator having a moveable arm comprising one or more links. A surgical instrument
is attached to a free end of the arm. The instrument is designed to be applied to a surgical
site. A controller regulates movement of the arm to position the instrument with a high
degree of accuracy at the surgical site.
         [0004]          A component of many robotic systems is a force/torque sensor
assembly. The force/torque sensor assembly is attached between the free end of the arm
and the instrument. The force/torque sensor assembly monitors forces and torques that are
applied to the instrument. These may be forces and torques that are applied to the
instrument as a consequence of the instrument pressing against tissue. These also may be
forces and torques a practitioner applies in order to set a position and/or orientation of the
instrument. Signals output by the force/torque sensor assembly are received by the
controller. The controller uses these signals to determine a target position for the
instrument. Based on the determined target position, the controller actuates the arm in
order to advance the arm so that the instrument is moved to the target position.
         [0005]          In order to ensure all forces and torques applied to the instrument
                                               1

are measured, it is common practice to provide a six component force/torque sensor
assembly. This type of force/torque sensor assembly measures forces applied to the
instrument along three axes and torques applied to the instrument around the three axes.
         [0006]           One type of six component force/torque sensor assembly comprises
a set of strain gauges. These gauges include a static member to which a plurality of beams
are flexibly mounted. Typically one or more strain gauges are associated with each beam.
Each strain gauge acts as a transducer that is used to convert a force or torque into an
electrical signal. Each strain gauge generates an electrical signal proportional to the
flexure of the beam with which the strain gauge is associated. The output signals from the
strain gauges are input variables into an algorithm that yields the measured forces and
torques.
         [0007]           In force/torque sensor assemblies employing strain gauges, thermal
drift is a common problem. Thermal drift occurs when a change in temperature causes a
contraction or expansion of parts. Thermal drift can result in inaccurate placement of the
instrument at the surgical site. It is also common for these types of force/torque sensor
assemblies to take force and torque measurements at a single resolution. In some cases it
may be desirable for the force/torque sensor assembly to be capable of measuring forces
and torques at multiple resolutions.
         [0008]           Thus, there is a need in the art for a force/torque sensor assembly
and method of measuring forces and torques that overcomes one or more of these
deficiencies.
         [0008A]         According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is
provided a sensor assembly comprising:
         a base plate;
         a sensor member displaceable relative to said base plate;
         a light sensitive transducer having a plurality of pixels; and
         a light source configured to provide light directed in a plurality of light beams
onto said light sensitive transducer so that the light beams strike different pixels of said
                                                2

light sensitive transducer to sense displacement of said sensor member relative to said
base plate.
        [0008B]          In one embodiment of the invention, the sensor assembly includes a
spring arrangement which operates in successive first and second stages in response to
displacement of the sensor member relative to the base plate. Different resolutions of
force and torque measurements are associated with the first and second stages. A light
sensitive transducer may sense displacement of the sensor member relative to the base
plate and generates corresponding output signals.
        [0009]           According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is
provided a method of assessing forces and torques using a sensor including a light
sensitive transducer having a plurality of pixels, said method comprising the steps of:
        operating the sensor to direct a plurality of light beams onto the light sensitive
transducer;
        applying a load on the sensor so that each of the plurality of light beams move on
the light sensitive transducer; and
        determining forces and torques based on differences in locations of pixels lighted
by the light beams as the light beams move in response to the applied load.
        [0010]           According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is
provided a robotic system comprising:
        a linkage assembly;
        an instrument attached to said linkage assembly;
        a sensor assembly acting between said instrument and said linkage assembly, said
sensor assembly including:
                 a base plate;
                 a sensor member displaceable relative to said base plate;
                 a light sensitive transducer having a plurality of pixels configured to
        generate output signals; and
                 a light source configured to provide light directed in a plurality of light
        beams onto said light sensitive transducer so that the light beams strike different
                                             3

        pixels of said light sensitive transducer to sense displacement of said sensor
        member relative to said base plate; and
        a controller in communication with said light sensitive transducer to receive the
output signals and determine forces and torques based on the output signals.
        [0011]          According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is
provided a method of assessing forces and torques in a robotic system including a
manipulator and an instrument coupled to the manipulator, said method comprising the
steps of:
        providing a sensor including a light sensitive transducer having a plurality of
pixels;
        operating the sensor to direct a plurality of light beams onto the light sensitive
transducer;
        applying a load on the instrument so that each of the plurality of light beams move
on the light sensitive transducer; and
        determining forces and torques based on differences in locations of pixels lighted
by the light beams as the light beams move in response to the applied load.
        [0012]           Robotic systems and methods employing these sensor assemblies
and methods for assessing forces and torques are also provided.
        [0013]           One advantage of the sensor assemblies and methods according to
the preferred embodiments of the invention is that the sensor assemblies are capable of
determining forces and torques at different resolutions for certain applications. Another
advantage is that the sensor assemblies operate optically to avoid potential thermal drift
issues associated with strain gauges.
        [0014]           The invention will now be described, by way of non-limiting
example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

I.      OVERVIEW
        [0045]         Figure 1 illustrates a robotic surgical system including a
manipulator 30 and a surgical instrument 32. The surgical instrument 32 is supported by
the manipulator 30 for movement with respect to a patient P. In some embodiments, the
manipulator 30 functions in manual and semi-autonomous modes to position the
instrument 32 with respect to a target site on the patient P.
        [0046]         The manipulator 30 includes an instrument mount 36 to which the
                                             7

instrument 32 is rigidly attached. In some embodiments, the instrument 32 is also
removably attached to the instrument mount 36. Manipulator 30 moves the instrument
mount 36 to position and orient the instrument 32 so that the instrument 32 performs the
intended medical/surgical procedure on the patient P.
        [0047]          A surgical navigation system 220 monitors the position and/or
orientation of the instrument 32 relative to the target site. The surgical navigation system
220 communicates position and/or orientation data to the manipulator 30 so that the
manipulator 30 can properly position the instrument 32.
        [0048]           Manipulator 30 includes a mobile cart 38. A linkage assembly 40
moveably connects the instrument 32 to the cart 38. In the illustrated embodiment this
linkage assembly 40 comprises first and second parallel four bar link assemblies 42, 44.
The position of each joint of each link assembly is set by a plurality of actuators 46. In
Figure 1, one of the actuators 46 associated with link assembly 42 is identified.
        [0049]          A manipulator controller 48, (partially shown as a phantom box in
Figure 1) is mounted to the cart 38. The manipulator controller 48 transmits the control
signals that cause the actuators 46 to appropriately set the links of the link assemblies 42,
44. The manipulator controller 48 sets the positions of the links based on a number of
input signals. These input signals include signals from the surgical navigation system 220.
        [0050]           The structure of the manipulator 30, including the manipulator
controller 48, and the instrument 32 are set forth in more detail is U.S. Patent Application
No. 13/958,070, filed August 2, 2013, entitled, "Surgical Manipulator Capable of
Controlling a Surgical Instrument in Multiple Modes," the disclosure of which is hereby
incorporated by reference.
        [0051]          In some embodiments the instrument 32 includes a power
generating unit (not shown). The power generating unit converts electrical signals into a
form of energy that is applied to the patient P. This energy may be mechanical, sonic,
thermal, RF, EM or photonic. When the instrument 32 includes a power generating unit,
the energy is applied to the target site through an energy applicator 50. In the illustrated
                                              8

embodiment, the instrument 32 includes an energy applicator 50 in the form of a cutting
bur for cutting tissue such as bone. The bur extends from a handpiece of the instrument
32.
I.      FORCE/TORQUE SENSOR ASSEMBLY
        [0052]          As shown in Figure 2, a force/torque sensor assembly 52 is
provided to react to loads applied to the instrument 32. The loads may include resistive
forces and torques to which the instrument 32 is exposed as a result of the instrument 32
being pressed against tissue. The loads may also include forces and torques applied to the
instrument 32 by a user when the user desires to set a position and/or orientation of the
instrument 32. Manipulator controller 48 sets the position of the links, and thus the
instrument 32, based on the forces and torques measured by the force/torque sensor
assembly 52.
        [0053]          The force/torque sensor assembly 52, as shown in Figures 3 and 4,
acts between the linkage assembly 40 and the instrument 32. The force/torque sensor
assembly includes a head plate 54, a diverter plate 56 and a base plate 58. These plates 54,
56, 58 support the force/torque sensor assembly 52 for operation between the linkage
assembly 40 and the instrument 32. In Figure 3, the widths of the plates 54, 56 and 58 are
exaggerated for purposes of illustration.
        [0054]          Referring to Figure 4, the head plate 54 is disc shaped so as to have
opposed proximally and distally directed faces that are planar and parallel to each other.
Head plate 54 is formed from a single piece of stainless steel or other metal alloy. Head
plate 54 has a thickness of approximately 6.5 mm. In some embodiments, head plate 54
has a diameter of between about 4.5 and 6.5 mm. Head plate 54 is attached to a
proximally directed face of a mounting plate 60. The mounting plate 60 is fixed to the
instrument mount 36. (Here "proximal" is understood to be towards the manipulator cart
38, away from the target site to which the instrument 32 is to be applied and "distal" is
understood to be away from manipulator cart 38, towards the target site to which the
instrument 32 is to be applied).
                                             9

         [0055]          Sets of first and second throughbores 62, 64 extend between the
opposed faces of the head plate 54. The first throughbores 62 are located radially outward
from the center of the head plate 54. The first throughbores 62 are equally spaced from
each other. A proximal opening of first throughbores 62 is defined by a tapered recess 66
that is angled inwardly toward the center of first throughbores 62. Second throughbores
64 are spaced radially outwardly from first throughbores 62 so as to be located a small
distance inwardly from an outer perimeter of head plate 54. The second throughbores 64
are also equally spaced from each other, yet not radially aligned with the adjacent first
throughbore 62. Head plate 54 is further formed to define a side bore 68 that extends
radially inwardly from a side surface of the head plate 54. Threaded fasteners (not shown)
extend through second throughbores 64 to hold the head plate 54 to the mounting plate
60.
         [0056]           Diverter plate 56 is located between the head plate 54 and the base
plate 58. Diverter plate 56 includes inner and outer sensor members. In the embodiment
shown, the inner and outer sensor members are inner and outer hubs, 70 and 72,
respectively. Inner hub 70 extends distally forward of the outer hub 72. Inner hub 70 is
connected to and able to move relative to the outer hub 72. Outer hub 72 is statically
secured to base plate 58. The inner hub 70 is statically secured to head plate 54. The hubs
70, 72 are both formed out of a single piece of hardened stainless steel.
         [0057]          Inner hub 70 has a generally circular outer shape. Inner hub 70 is
disposed within the outer hub 72. An outer perimeter of the inner hub 70 is defined, in
part, by three flat surfaces 74 that are arcuately and equally spaced from each other. A
curved surface 76 is located between each adjacent pair of flat surfaces 74.
         [0058]          Tines 78 extend radially outwardly from each curved surface 76.
Tines 78 are equiangularly spaced apart from each other and extend from the centers of
curved surfaces 76. Along the axes that extend between the opposed proximally and
distally directed faces of the tines 78, the tines 78 have a depth that is from about 0.25
mm to about 1.0 mm less than the depth of inner hub 70. The proximal faces (not
numbered) of the tines 78 are flush with the proximal face of the inner hub 70. The
distally directed faces (not numbered) of the tines are thus recessed relative to the
                                               10

adjacent distally directed face of inner hub 70.
         [0059]         Three hub throughbores 80 are located a short distance inward from
the outer perimeter of inner hub 70. Hub throughbores 80 have openings with a diameter
approximately equal to the diameter of first throughbores 62 in head plate 54. Each hub
throughbore 80 aligns with a separate first throughbore 62. Inner hub 70 has a centrally
located central throughbore 82. Central throughbore 82 is larger in diameter than hub
throughbores 80. A cylindrical step 84 projects radially from an inner surface that defines
the central throughbore 82. Step 84 is recessed proximally away from the distal face of
the inner hub 70. Step 84 extends inwardly approximately 0.75 mm from the inner surface
of central throughbore 82. A groove 86 extends radially outwardly from central
throughbore 82. Groove 86 is recessed relative to the distal face of inner hub 70. The base
of groove 86 is coplanar with step 84.
         [0060]         As shown in Figure 5, outer hub 72 is generally ring-like in shape.
Outer hub 72 has a diameter approximately equal to that of head plate 54. The outer hub
72 has the same proximal face-to-distal face depth as the tines 78. Thus the depth of the
outer hub 72 is less than that of inner hub 70. The distal face of inner hub 70 is raised
above the distal face of outer hub 72, as seen in Figure 3. In Figure 3, the extent to which
the inner hub 70 projects forward from the outer hub 72 is exaggerated for purposes of
illustration.
         [0061]         Outer hub 72 has three inwardly directed tabs 88. Tabs 88 are
equiangularly spaced apart from each other. Each tab 88 has side surfaces 90 that taper
inwardly towards each other. Each tab 88 has an arcuately shaped inner surface 92. Inner
surfaces 92 extend around a common circle that is concentric with the center axis of outer
hub 72. Each tab 88 is bisected by a tine slot 94. Each tine slot 94 extends radially
outwardly from the inner surface 92. Each tab 88 also has a tab throughbore 96. Tab
throughbores 96 are spaced circumferentially apart along the outer hub 72. Outer hub 72
is further shaped so that there is planar inner surface, a flat 98, between each adjacent pair
of tabs 88.
         [0062]         Each tine 78 extends into a separate one of the tine slots 94. Tine
                                               11

slots 94 have a width that is approximately 0.1 mm to 0.75 mm greater than the width of
tines 78. Diverter plate 56 is further dimensioned so that when the outer hub 72 is in the
neutral position, the outer end of each tine 78 is spaced approximately 0.1 mm to 0.75 mm
from the adjacent inwardly directed surfaces of the tab 88 that defines the associated tine
slot 94.
         [0063]          As seen in Figures 4 and 5, a spring arrangement movably attaches
the inner hub 70 to the outer hub 72. The spring arrangement includes three spring
devices 102. Each spring device 102 extends outwardly from a separate one of the flat
surfaces 74. Each spring device 102 includes a serpentine spring 104 and a leaf spring 106
arranged in series.
         [0064]          Each serpentine spring 104 includes a head 108, a torso 110 and a
leg 112. The head 108 is the portion of the serpentine spring 104 connected to the inner
hub 70. The head 108 projects radially outwardly from the flat surface 74.
         [0065]          The torso 110 extends from the head 108. Each torso includes a
plurality of U-shaped folds 114 and pleats 116 extending from the U-shaped folds 114. In
one embodiment, the torso 110 is formed from plural pleats 116 and folds 114. The pleats
 116 are parallel to each other. Folds 114 are generally semi-circular in shape. A first one
of the folds 114 connects one pleat 116 to the head 108. A second one of the folds 114
connects two pleats 116 together. A third one of the folds 114 connects another pleat 116
to the leg 112. Folds 114 are flexible. The flexibility of the folds 114 allows the
longitudinal axes of the pleats 116 to shift positions.
         [0066]          Each leg 112 comprises a relatively thick base. This base of the leg
 112 is the portion of the leg 112 from which the adjacent fold 114 extends. Two feet 118
extend outwardly from the outer end of each leg 112. Each foot 118 is in the form of a
thin strip having a thickness of approximately 0.25 to 0.75 mm. The feet 118 forming a
pair of feet 118 are coplanar. Each foot 118 has an end that merges into the side surface of
an adjacent tab 88. The feet 118 merge into the tabs 88 at locations inwardly radially from
the flats 98. Thus, each pair of feet 118 is parallel with and spaced inwardly from the
adjacent flat 98. In some embodiments, this spacing is between approximately 0.25 mm
                                              12

and 0.75 mm. Given that feet 118 are formed from flexible material and the feet 118 of
each pair of feet 118 are coplanar, each pair of feet 118 defines one of the leaf springs
 106.
         [0067]          Each spring device 102 can thus be considered to be a plural stage
spring device. One spring stage is the serpentine spring 104 formed by folds 114 and
pleats 116. The second spring stage is the leaf spring 106 formed by feet 118. Figure 5A
illustrates how these first and second stages affect the resolution of force/torque
measurements enabled by the force/torque sensor assembly 52.
         [0068]          Referring to Figures 6-9, each serpentine spring 104 accommodates
a plurality of pins 120. Each pin 120 is generally cylindrical in shape. Each pin 120 is
comprised of hardened stainless steel. Each pin 120 has a length such that the pin 120 can
extend across the entire width of the adjacent torso 110. The pins 120 have a radius that is
approximately 0.625 mm to 2.5 mm less than the radius of circles defined by the adjacent
folds 114. In one embodiment, pins 120 are approximately 6.25 mm in length and 1.168
mm in diameter. A first one of the pins 120 extends between the head 108 and the
adjacent pleat 116. A second of the pins 120 is located between the two pleats 116. A
third of the pins 120 is located between the radially outermost pleat 116 and the leg 112.
         [0069]          Each set of three pins 120 is seated in a pin housing 122. Pin
housing 122 is comprised of a cap 124 and a pin housing base 126. Pins 120 are
positioned between the cap 124 and the pin housing base 126. Cap 124 includes a panel
 128, and two opposed side walls 130. Panel 128 is rectangular in shape. Each side wall
 130 extends downward from side edges of panel 128. A panel bore 132 extends through
the center of panel 128. Pin housing base 126 is generally block-like in shape. A base
groove 134 extends through the middle of pin housing base 126. Base groove 134 is
dimensioned to accept torso 110. A pin groove 136 extends through the center of pin
housing base 126. Pin groove 136 intersects and is perpendicular to the base groove 134.
The pin groove 136 is of shallower depth than the base groove 134.
         [0070]          Referring to Figures 4 and 10, base plate 58 is attached to a distal
end component 138 of the linkage assembly 40 of the manipulator 30. This component
                                              13

 138 may be a coupler, robot flange, wrist or other component. The base plate 58 is formed
from hardened stainless steel. Base plate 58 is generally disc like in shape and has an
outer diameter equal to that of the outer diameter of outer hub 72. The base plate 58 has
an inner circular section 140 and an outer rim 142. Rim 142 extends circumferentially
around the outer edge of circular section 140. Rim 142 has a distally directed top face that
is raised above and parallel with the distally directed face of inner circular section 140.
Rim 142 is formed to have a plurality of first openings 144 and second openings 146 that
extend between the opposed proximally and distally directed faces of the rim 142. There
are three first openings 144 that are equiangularly spaced apart from each other. There are
three second openings 146 that are equiangularly spaced apart from each other.
         [0071]          A plurality of recesses 148 are located on the distal face of rim 142.
The recesses 148 are open along the inner surface of rim 142. Each recess 148 is generally
in the form of a rectangle. Each recess 148 is defined by a pair of opposed side surfaces
and a bottom surface. Each recess 148 is shaped so the distance across the opposed side
surfaces are equal to the width across tine slots 94. Three recesses 148 are equally spaced
apart on the distal face of rim 142. The recesses 148 are positioned so that when
force/torque sensor assembly 52 is assembled, each recess 148 is in registration with one
of the tine slots 94 in the diverter plate 56.
         [0072]          Fasteners (not shown) extend through the first openings 144 to hold
the base plate 58 to the distal end component 138 of the linkage assembly 40. Fasteners
(not shown) extend through the second openings 146 and tab throughbores 96 to hold the
diverter plate 56 to the base plate 58.
         [0073]          The force/torque sensor assembly 52 is an optically-based sensor
assembly that includes a light source 154 mounted to the base plate 58. Light from the
light source 154 is directed through a collimator 156 onto a light sensitive transducer 158.
The collimator 156 converts the light into a plurality of light beams. As loads are applied
on the instrument 32, the collimator 156 is displaced relative to the light sensitive
transducer 158 so that the light beams strike different pixels of the light sensitive
transducer 158. This movement of the light beams effectively senses the forces and
torques applied to the instrument 32 and can be correlated into force and torque
                                               14

measurements.
         [0074]         The light source 142 is located adjacent to the outer edge of the
distal face of inner circular section 140. Light source 142 is thus adjacent and may be
coplanar with the inwardly directed face of rim 142. In some embodiments, light source
142 is an LED light source that includes one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs). Two
LEDs are shown in Figure 4.
         [0075]         A light pipe 160 is mounted to a distal face of inner hub 70. The
light pipe 160 receives light emitted by the light source 142 and directs it to the collimator
156. Light pipe 160 is shaped to have a cylindrical stem 162. The proximal end of the
stem 162 is located above light source 142 to receive light emitted from the light source
142. A branch 164 extends perpendicularly from a distal end of stem 162. Branch 164 is
dimensioned to seat in inner hub groove 86. A circular head 166 extends from a free end
of the branch 164. Head 166 is formed to have a disc shaped lens. Head 166 is
dimensioned to seat in a counterbore to central throughbore 82. Upon assembly of the
force/torque sensor assembly 52, the light pipe
160 is positioned so that the head 166 is disposed in the counterbore above the collimator
156.
         [0076]         The light pipe 160 is formed of plastic, glass or other material that
is able to convey light emitted by light source 142 to the collimator 156. In some
embodiments, the light pipe 160 is a fiber optic conduit or an injection molded light pipe
comprised of a single piece of plastic. In other embodiments the light pipe 160 is
eliminated altogether and the LEDs are instead positioned directly above the collimator
156 or other light focusing device.
         [0077]         Collimator 156 is fixed to the inner hub 70. The collimator 156
may be fixed by adhesive, tape, welding or other methods. Collimator 156 is seated in the
counterbore beneath the light pipe 160. Collimator 156 is disc shaped and has a diameter
approximately equal to counterbore so that the outer perimeter of collimator 156 seats on
step 84 formed in inner hub 70. In one embodiment collimator 156 has a diameter of
approximately 7.5 mm. The collimator 156 is formed from quartz or alternatively is built
                                              15

into the diverter plate 56 (e.g., machined to be a part of the diverter plate 56).
         [0078]          As seen in Figure 11, collimator 156 is formed to have a plurality
of light openings. Four of the light openings are shown as normal bores 172, 174, 176,
178. Normal bores 172, 174, 176, 178 are throughbores formed normally to opposed top
and bottom surfaces of the collimator 156, i.e., normal bores 172, 174, 176, 178 extend
through collimator 156 along axes perpendicular to the opposed top and bottom surfaces
of the collimator 156. The normal bores 172, 174, 176, 178 are arranged in a square
pattern and spaced equidistantly from a center of collimator 156.
         [0079]          The plurality of light openings also include two angled bores 180,
182, as seen in Figures 11, 13A and 13B. Angled bores 180, 182 are angled in that they
extend through the collimator 156 along axes that are arranged at an acute angle to the
normal axes between the top and bottom surfaces of the collimator 156. Angled bores
180, 182 are spaced equally away from the center of the collimator 156. Angled bores
180, 182 angle inwardly towards the center of collimator 156. In some embodiments,
bores 172, 174, 176, 178, 180, 182 are square-shaped. In other embodiments, bores 172,
174, 176, 178, 180, 182 are circular in shape.
         [0080]          The light sensitive transducer 158 is located centrally on a printed
circuit board 184. The printed circuit board 184 is seated on the distally directed face of
circular section 140 and is thereby fixed with respect to the base plate 58. The printed
circuit board 184 has a shape and size approximately equal to that of the distal face of
circular section 140. In the illustrated embodiment, the light sensitive transducer 158 is an
image sensor. The image sensor may be a CMOS image sensor or any other light sensitive
transducer. In one version the image sensor is the LUPA 1300A sensor available from
Cypress Semiconductor of San Jose, CA.
         [0081]          The light sensitive transducer 158 contains a number of individual
light sensitive elements such as pixels. The pixels are arranged in a row-by-column
format or matrix. Each pixel outputs a signal representative of the strength of the light
striking the pixel. In some embodiments, light sensitive transducer 158 has a pixel size of
25 microns or less. In certain embodiments, the light sensitive transducer 158 has a
                                               16

resolution of 1280 x 1024 pixels. Each pixel is approximately 14 microns by 14 microns
in this embodiment.
         [0082]          A voltage regulator 186 is mounted to printed circuit board 184.
Voltage regulator 186 supplies a constant voltage signal to light sensitive transducer 158.
In the illustrated embodiment light sensitive transducer 158 is shown mounted to an
exposed face of voltage regulator 186.
         [0083]          The bores 172, 174, 176, 178, 180, 182 of the collimator 156 divide
the light from the light pipe 160 into a number of separate light beams. The light beams
strike a face of the light sensitive transducer 158. Light sensitive transducer 158 outputs
signals representative of the locations that the light beams strike on the light sensitive
transducer 158. These signals may be sent to a local controller (not shown) for processing.
The signals are processed to ultimately yield forces and torques. The manipulator
controller 48 utilizes the forces and torques to control movement of the actuators 46 and,
thus, the instrument 32. It should be appreciated that the output signals from the light
sensitive transducer 158 could also be sent directly to the manipulator controller 48 in
other embodiments.
         [0084]          During surgery, loads applied to the instrument 32 cause at least
miniscule displacement of the instrument 32. This displacement of the instrument 32 is
transmitted through the instrument mount 36 and the mounting plate 60 to the head plate
54 and inner hub 70 -all being considered a single rigid body. The displacement of the
inner hub 70 results in a shift of the position and/or orientation, i.e., movement, of the
collimator 156 relative to the light sensitive transducer 158. As a result, the light beams
from the bores 172, 174, 176, 178, 180, 182 also move thereby enabling the determination
of forces and torques.
III.     DETERMINING FORCES AND TORQUES
         [0085]          Force/torque sensor assembly 52 is considered to be in a loaded
state when loads are applied to the instrument 32. When loads (e.g., forces and/or torques)
are applied to the force/torque sensor assembly 52, the inner hub 70 can engage in six
                                              17

types of movement relative to the outer hub 72. Three of the movements are translation.
The inner hub 70 can move along the x-axis, arbitrarily, the horizontal axis through the
inner hub 70 in Figure 5. Inner hub 70 can engage in movement along the y-axis,
arbitrarily the vertical axis through the inner hub 70 in Figure 5. The inner hub can engage
in movement along the z-axis, arbitrarily the axis through the center of the inner hub 70
that extends in and out of the plane of Figure 5. Inner hub 70 can also engage in at least
some rotational movement around each of the aboveidentified axes. Typically as a result
of the application of forces and torques to the force/torque sensor assembly 52, the inner
hub 70 engages in several of these movements.
         [0086]           When there is an application of force and/or torque to the
instrument 32, the collimator 156 and light pipe 160, consequently, equally move with the
inner hub 70. This displacement of the collimator 156 causes light emitted by the light
source 154 to strike different pixels of the light sensitive transducer 158. The light
sensitive transducer 158 outputs signals that show the movements of the collimated light
which is directly related to the forces and torques applied to the instrument 32.
         [0087]           In the absence of the application of any forces or torques to the
force/torque sensor assembly 52, the force/torque sensor assembly 52 is considered in the
unloaded state. When the manipulator 30 is in use, even in the absence of other forces,
gravity imposes forces and torques on the force/torque sensor assembly 52. It should be
understood that a major component of this gravitation force is the force gravity places on
the instrument 32 and energy applicator 50. This gravitational force causes some
displacement of the inner hub 70 relative to the outer hub 72 when inner hub 70 is in the
pure unloaded state. Given the nominal nature of this force, and nominal displacement of
the inner hub 70, the locations of the light beams are considered to be in their gravity
offset unloaded state.
         [0088]           During operation of manipulator 30, the light emitted by the light
source 154 (represented by numeral 155 in the Figures) extends through bores 172, 174,
 176, 178, 180, 182 as light beams. These light beams strike different clusters of pixels on
the surface of the light sensitive transducer 158. More specifically, each light beam strikes
a different cluster of pixels in the unloaded state and in the loaded state. The shifts in the
                                              18

positions/locations of the clusters of pixels from the unloaded state to the loaded state,
e.g., from a start of a time frame (initial cluster) to an end of the time frame (final cluster),
are used to determine the forces and torques.
         [0089]            Figures 12A and 12B depict two of the light beams that pass
through two of the normal bores, bores 172 and 176 in the unloaded and loaded states.
Figures 13A and 13B depict how two light beams pass through the angled bores 180, 182
in the unloaded and loaded states. Notably, the light beams that pass through the angled
bores 180, 182 strike the light sensitive transducer 158 as ellipses.
         [0090]           During manufacture, the collimator 156 is arranged with respect to
the light sensitive transducer 158 so that for the maximum range of motion of each light
beam (for all six degrees of freedom) each light beam is constrained to separate sectors S
(or windows) on the light sensitive transducer 158, so that the pixels in each sector S can
be separately electronically processed to determine a location of a centroid of the light
beam on the light sensitive transducer 158. See, for example, the light beams 172B, 174B,
 176B, 178B shown in Figure 11 A from normal bores 172, 174, 176, 178 that strike the
light sensitive transducer 158 in separate sectors Sl-S4 and the light beams 180B, 182B
from angled bores 180, 182 that strike the light sensitive transducer 158 in separate
sectors S5-S6. For the full range of displacement of the force/torque sensor assembly 52,
each of the light beams are constrained to remain fully in their corresponding sectors SI
S6.
         [0091]           The light sensitive transducer        158 continually outputs to
manipulator controller 48 the signals emitted by each pixel in each sector S 1-S6. Each
pixel has a specific row/column location on the light sensitive transducer 158. The signals
received by manipulator controller 48 are proportional to the quantity of light that strikes
the pixel at that location. For purposes of understanding the illustrated embodiment, the
pixel at the lower left of Figures 14A and 14B is considered to be the pixel at row/column
location (0, 0) 188.
         [0092]           As mentioned above, each light beam strikes a cluster of pixels in
each sector S1-S6. Accordingly, the controller 48 receives from the light sensitive
                                                19

transducer 145 signals that make up an image that includes six sets of pixels, each set
comprising output signals from multiple pixels that are exposed to light. For each of these
sets of pixels, the controller 48 determines the centroid of the light beams.
         [0093]          The centroids can be determined by processing the signal strengths
in each set using conventional processing techniques, as shown in Figures 15, 15A, and
 15B. For example, the light beams 172B, 174B, 176B, 178B shown in Figure 15, which
pass through the normal bores 172, 174, 176, 178, strike distinct clusters of pixels. These
clusters are processed by summing the signal strengths, for each set of pixels associated
with sectors Sl-S4, along all the columns of pixels, and all the rows of pixels, in each
sector and identifying the peak signal strengths along the columns and rows to identify the
centroid in x, y coordinates. The peak signal strengths may be associated with a specific
pixel location, but interpolation or other processing of the summed output signal values
may result in the location of the peak signal strengths along the columns and rows not
necessarily being bound by physical location of a single pixel. See an example of this
processing in Figures 15A and 15B.
         [0094]          Controller 48 assigns the location of the centroid in the x-y
coordinate system of the light sensitive transducer 158 to be on the on-sensor location to
which the light beam is applied. Controller 48 performs the above processes six times,
once for each light beam and sector. This process is repeated in each frame of operation of
the force/torque sensor assembly 52. Therefore, for each frame of operation, twelve x, y
coordinates are provided in the embodiment in which the collimator 156 has four normal
bores 172, 174, 176, 178 and two angled bores 180, 182. The minimum frequency with
which a complete set of signals for all the pixels is output is 1 Hz. In some embodiments,
the frequency in which a complete set of signals for all pixels is output is at least 10 Hz or
greater. Each set of signals can be considered to represent the positions of the light beams
at the end of a single time frame.
         [0095]          It has been shown that in other embodiments fewer coordinates are
needed to provide adequate input information to determine the forces and torques. See, for
example, the light beams shown in Figure 16. Here, only two light beams through two
normal bores 216, 218 are shown along with the two light beams through the two angled
                                             20

bores 180, 182. In this case, eight coordinates xl, yl, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are calculated
by the controller 48 based on the centroids of the light beams. Still, only six of those
coordinates are needed to solve for the forces and torques. These coordinates include xl,
y2, x3, y3, x4, y4.
         [0096]           The basis for the selection of these coordinates xl, y2, x3, y3, x4,
y4 comes from understanding how the light beams shift under each of the different
force/torque conditions, e.g., for each of the six forces/torques being determined. These
shifts are illustrated in Figure 16.
         [0097]           As shown in Figure 16, when a force F, is applied along the x-axis,
each of the light beams shift equally along the x-axis, and therefore, Fx can be correlated
to a shift in one of the x coordinates of the light beams, such as by a shift in xl, x3, and/or
x4. Similarly, when a force Fy is applied along the y-axis, each of the light beams shift
equally along the y-axis, and therefore, Fy can be correlated to a shift in one of the y
coordinates of the light beams, such as by a shift in y2, y3, and/or y4.
         [0098]           When a force Fz is applied along the z-axis, the angled nature of the
angled bores 180, 182 yields a change in the positions of their light beams on the light
sensitive transducer 158 while the light beams through the normal bores 216, 218 remain
unchanged (e.g., the centroids are unchanged although there may be small changes in the
cluster of pixels affected by the light beam). This is a result of displacement of the
collimator 156 toward or away from the light sensitive transducer 158 in the z-axis when
force Fz is applied. Owing to this displacement, the distance between the two angled light
beams on the light sensitive transducer 158 changes. In Figure 13A, this distance is
depicted as distance ZADJ. The value of distance ZADJu is scalar and constant
throughout operation of force/torque sensor assembly 52 as representing the distance in
the unloaded state. In Figure 13B, ZADJE shows how the distance changes in the loaded
state. Therefore, since the angled bores 180, 182 direct their light beams radially inwardly
along the x-axis toward the center, Fz can be correlated to a shift in the x coordinates of
the light beams through the angled bores, such as by a shift in x1 and x3, as illustrated in
Figure 16.
                                               21

         [0099]          When a torque T, is applied about the x-axis, causing a pivoting of
the collimator 156 about the x-axis, each of the light beams shift along the y-axis, but not
all equally. As shown in Figure 16, when the torque T, is applied, the shift of the light
beam from normal bore 216 along the y-axis is less than the shift from normal bore 218
along the y-axis. The shift of the light beams from the angled bores 180, 182 along the y
axis falls somewhere in between. The pivoting of the collimator 156 about the x-axis
causes one half of the collimator 156 to move closer to the light sensitive transducer 158
and the other half moves away from the light sensitive transducer 158 thereby resulting in
different shift distances. As a result, T, can be correlated to a shift in the y coordinates of
the light beams, such as by a shift in y2, y3, and/or y4.
         [0100]          Similarly, when a torque Ty is applied about the y-axis, causing a
pivoting of the collimator 156 about the y-axis, each of the light beams shift along the x
axis, but not all equally. As shown in Figure 16, when the torque Ty is applied, the shift of
the light beam from angled bore 180 along the x-axis is less than the shift from angled
bore 182 along the x-axis. The shift of the light beams from the normal bores 216, 218
along the x-axis falls somewhere in between. The pivoting of the collimator 156 about the
y-axis causes one half of the collimator 156 to move closer to the light sensitive
transducer 158 and the other half moves away from the light sensitive transducer 158
thereby resulting in different shift distances. As a result, Ty can be correlated to a shift in
the x coordinates of the light beams, such as by a shift in xl, x3, and/or x4.
         [0101]           When a torque Tz is applied about the z-axis, causing a rotation of
the collimator 156 about the z-axis, each of the light beams shift equally clockwise or
counterclockwise. As a result, Tz can be correlated to a shift in the slope of a line between
any two centroids. Thus, for example, Tz can be correlated to the x, y coordinates of any
pair of light beams, including x3, y3 and x4, y4.
         [0102]          Ultimately, the controller 48 is able to compute the three forces Fx,
Fy, Fz and the three torques Tx, Ty, Tz applied to the force/torque sensor assembly 52
based on these six coordinates associated with displacement of the centroids of the light
beams, e.g., xl, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4. Computation of the forces and torques relies upon a
multiple linear regression model and prior calibration of the force/torque sensor assembly
                                              22

52.
        [0103] Calibration of the force/torque sensor assembly 52 includes applying sets
of known forces and torques on the force/torque sensor assembly 52. This includes
collecting values for each of the six coordinates xl, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 for each applied
force and torque, which yields a plurality of data sets for each of Fx, Fy, Fz, Tx, Ty, Tz.
Data arrays of force/torque outputs can then be created for each axis with the outputs
zeroed out in the orthogonal axes to constrain the solution. The multiple linear regression
is then computed to solve for the row of A values for the particular axis using a least
squares method -for example, Ax = (XTX)-lXT FX.. This computation is conducted for all
three axes for force and torque to yield six values in total. Once the force/torque sensor
assembly 52 is calibrated, the following calibration matrix can be used to compute the
forces and torques (where o is a small offset term):
  F                -a
                    11     a12    a13    a14     a15     a16          -xO             -i
  F9               a 21    a 22   a 23   a 24    a 25    a 26         Y2              02
  F                a3 1    a 32   a 33   a3 4    a 3s    a3 6         X3              03
           =Ta      41     a42    a4 3   a4 4    a 45    a 46        Y3         +     04
                   a5 1    a 52   a 53   a 54    a5 5    a 56         X4              05

 _Tz
        [0104]          Thus, controller 48 is able to determine the three forces Fx, Fy, Fz
and the three torques Tx, Ty, Tz applied to the force/torque sensor assembly 52 using
linear algebra and centroid values. These force and torque values are then forwarded to
other modules integral with the manipulator controller 48. These other modules employ
the force and torque data to regulate the operation of the manipulator 30.
IV.     MULTI-STAGE RESOLUTION
        [0105]          The force/torque sensor assembly 52 provides two stages of
sensitivity in a single transducer, as shown in Figure 5A. Sensitivity is defined as the
resolution of mechanical force/torque data measurements. For example, in one
embodiment a first stage captures forces with a minimum and maximum range of zero (0)
                                            23

to five (5) pounds with the maximum upper range being no greater than ten (10) pounds.
A second stage captures forces with a minimum and maximum range of five (5) pounds to
fifty (50) pounds with the maximum upper range being no greater than one hundred (100)
pounds.
         [0106]          Each spring device 102 is dimensioned and configured within the
diverter plate 56 to achieve the two levels of sensitivity for determining force and/or
torque applied to the instrument 32 thereby providing different resolutions of force/torque
measurements.
         [0107]          In one embodiment, when relatively low forces and torques are
applied to the force/torque sensor assembly 52, initially, it is the leaf spring components,
i.e., the feet 118, that flex in the first stage of spring displacement. Folds 114 are not
flexed. The flexures of the leaf springs 106 are linearly proportional to the magnitude of
composite forces and torques applied to the force/torque sensor assembly 52 and thus
provide the first stage of sensitivity of the force/torque sensor assembly 52, as illustrated
in Figure 5A.
         [0108]          Once the magnitude of the applied forces and torques reach the
maximum of the first stage, at least one pair of feet 118 is flexed outwardly to such an
extent that the feet 118 abut the adjacent flat 98 so that further flexure is prevented
thereby ending the first stage of spring displacement. The application of still larger forces
and torques results in the flexure of the serpentine spring 104 in a second stage of spring
displacement. It should be appreciated that when this event occurs one or two of the
spring torsos 110 expands, i.e., is placed in tension, while the other torso(s) 110 is placed
in compression. Owing to the structure of the spring arrangement, these spring expansions
and compressions are again linearly proportional to the magnitude of the composite forces
and torques applied to the force/torque sensor assembly 52 and thus provide the second
stage of sensitivity of the force/torque assembly 52 shown in Figure 5A.
         [0109]          It should be appreciated that the first and second stages of
sensitivity are related to the serpentine springs 104 and leaf springs 106 having different
                                               24

spring rates. In some embodiments, the leaf springs 106 could be configured to provide
the second stage of sensitivity while the serpentine springs 104 provide the first stage of
sensitivity, i.e., by switching which of the serpentine springs 104 or leaf springs 106 have
the larger spring rate. In such an embodiment, when one torso 110 is compressed so that
all of the pins 120 are fully pinched between elements of the serpentine spring 104,
further flexing of the serpentine spring 104 is stopped thereby ending the first stage of
displacement of the serpentine spring 104. Thereafter, the associated leaf spring 106 is
compressed in the second stage of displacement until one or more of the tines 78 bottom
out in the tine slots 94 to stop any further displacement.
          [0110]          As previously discussed, the manipulator controller 48 utilizes the
forces and torques generated by the force/torque sensor assembly 52 to control movement
of the actuators 46 and, thus, the instrument 32. These two different resolutions of
force/torque measurements could be utilized by the manipulator controller 48 for various
purposes.
V.       ASSEMBLY
          [0111]          Force/torque sensor assembly 52 is first assembled by seating the
second of the pins 120 within pin groove 136. The pin housing base 122 is then positioned
so that the torso 110 seats in base groove 134. Next, adjacently located pins 120 are
seated. Cap 124 is then placed on pin housing base 122 to secure the pins 120 in position.
Side walls 130 extend over the ends of the adjacent pins 120 and the sides of the pin
housing base 122. This process is repeated until each serpentine spring 104 is fitted with
pins 120 secured in position by a pin housing 122. The pins 120 and serpentine springs
 104 are sized so that when the serpentine springs 104 are at rest (i.e., before expansion or
compression) there exists some spacing in which the serpentine springs 104 can flex
before the pins 120 stop further spring actuation.
          [0112]          Once pins 120 are seated within pin housing 122, collimator 156
and light pipe 160 are seated within the inner hub 70 of diverter plate 56. Collimator 156
is first seated on the step 84. Light pipe 160 is next seated within groove 86. Light pipe
 160 is seated so that head 166 of light pipe 160 is spaced distally away from collimator
                                              25

 156.
        [0113]          The printed circuit board 184 is seated within circular section 140.
The printed circuit board 184 is attached to circular section 140 using fasteners (not
shown). Voltage regulator 186, light sensitive transducer 158 and light source 154 are
then seated on a distal face of the circular section 140. Voltage regulator 186 and light
sensitive transducer 158 are located centrally on the circular section 140. Light sensitive
transducer 158 is attached to the distal face of voltage regulator 186. Once these
components are secured to the base plate 58, outer hub 72 is fastened and fixed to base
plate 58.
        [0114]          Once diverter plate 56 is secured to base plate 58, head plate 54 is
attached to inner hub 70. Specifically, threaded fasteners enter through first throughbores
62 and complimentary hub throughbores 80. This completes the assembly of force/torque
sensor assembly 52.
        [0115]          As shown in Figure 3, once force/torque sensor assembly 52 is
assembled, the base plate 58 is mounted to the manipulator 30. Mounting plate 60 is then
fixed to the head plate 54 and the instrument 32 is mounted onto the instrument mount 36.
VI.     OTHER EMBODIMENTS
        [0116]          In some embodiments, the centroid coordinates can be utilized in
an alternative manner to compute the forces and torques. The basic principle, however,
remains the same, namely that movement of the centroids of the light beams on the light
sensitive transducer 158 as loads are applied to the instrument 32 correlate to the six
components of force and torque applied to the force/torque sensor assembly 52. One such
embodiment is described below.
        [0117]          Referring to Figure 17, as part of an initialization of manipulator
30, a memory integral with manipulator controller 48 is provided with data defining a
distance R. The distance R is the distance from the center C of the force/torque sensor
assembly 52 to the energy applicator 50. More specifically, the distance R is the distance
                                             26

from the center C of the force/torque sensor assembly 52 to the distal end tip of any tool
or cutting accessory of the instrument 32. Here, the distal end tip is understood to be a bur
of the energy applicator 50. For the bur, the distance R is the distance from the center C of
force/torque sensor assembly 52 to the centroid 51 of the bur. Distance R can be
determined using a navigation pointer (not illustrated) the position and orientation of
which is tracked by the navigation system 220.
         [0118]          Manipulator controller 48 breaks down distance R into its x, y, and
z-axis components, respectively, into distances r, r, and r,. These distance components
are stored in the memory. The above processes can be considered part of the step of
providing and storing in the memory the sensor initial state data, step 260 of Figure 18A.
         [0119]          The locations of the centroids of the light beams emitted through
the normal bores 172, 174, 176, 178 when the force/torque sensor assembly 52 is in the
unloaded state are represented as points 190, 192, 194, 196, respectively, in Figure 14A.
For reasons of simplicity, the points associated with the light beams that pass through
angled bores 180, 182 are not shown in either Figure 14A or Figure 14B.
         [0120]          In a step 262 of Figure 18A controller 48 determines the on-sensor
unloaded state location of each light beam that extends through the normal bores 172,
 174, 176, 178. Each of these locations is defined as a location (STRXu, STRYu). Through
this document, superscript "U "represents the unloaded location of the variable. Subscript
"m" identifies which one of the four light beams is specified.
         [0121]         Also, in step 262, controller 48 determines the on-sensor location
of the light beams that extend through the individual angled bores 180, 182 when the
force/torque sensor assembly 52 is in the unloaded state. These locations are the locations
of the centroids of the light beams through the angled bores 180, 182, ANGX,        ANGYu.
Subscript "p" identifies which one of the two light beams is specified.
         [0122]          In a step 264 of Figure 18A, controller 48, calculates the distance
between the on-sensor location between the two angled light beams, the distance between
the two points ANGX,      ANGYu . This distance, depicted in Figure 13A, is referred to as
                                              27

distance ZADJu.
         [0123]          The controller 48 assigns each light beam an initial start of frame
location based on the location of the centroid of each light beam (initial centroid). For
each light beam this is location (STRXs, STRYs). Here, superscript " S " represents the
start of time frame location. For the first time frame, the start of frame location for each
beam is set to the unloaded state on-sensor location of the light beam. In other words:
                         STRXs    =  STRXu                (1)
and                       STRYs    = STRYu                (2)
          [0124]        Manipulator controller 48, in a step 266, calculates the slope of the
line between the centroid locations of two of the light beams through the normal bores
 172, 174, 176, 178. Often, the controller 48 determines the slopes of two lines that extend
between centroid locations of the beams. Thus, the controller 48 determines the slope of
lines 198 and 200 in Figure 14A. Line 198 is the line between points 190 and 196, which
identify the centroids of light beams through normal bores 172 and 178. Line 200 is the
line between points 192 and 194 which identify the centroids of light beams through
normal bores 174 and 174. Arbitrarily, slope Ssis the angle of the slope of line 198 and
slope Ss is the angle of the slope of line 200. Slope is defined as the rise/run based on
change in x/y from point 190 to point 196 in Figure 14A.
         [0125]          Based on the signals from light sensitive transducer 158, controller
48 determines the end-of-frame on-sensor locations of the light beams, e.g., final centroid
locations, in a step 268. As mentioned above, when the force/torque sensor assembly 52 is
in the loaded state, the collimator 156 is in a shifted positioned relative to when in the
unloaded state since the shifting of the inner hub 70 results of a like shifting of the
position of the collimator 156. This means the light beams that pass through the
collimator 156 strike different locations on the light sensitive transducer 158 than when
the force/torque sensor assembly 52 is in the unloaded state.
         [0126]          In Figure 14B, point 202 represents the shift of a centroid of a first
                                              28

beam from point 190. Point 204 represents the shift of a centroid of a second beam from
the location of point 192. Point 206 represents the shift of a centroid of a third beam from
the location of point 194. Point 208 represents the shift of a centroid of a fourth beam
from the location of point 196.
         [0127]           Step 268 is performed using the same processes that are employed
to perform step 262. Therefore, as a consequence of the execution of step 268, controller
48 has location data (STRXE,, STRYE) for each of the four light beams associated with the
normal bores 172, 174, 176, 178. In this document, superscript "E " indicates an end-of
frame location data or variable associated with the light beam or beams.
         [0128]           As a consequence of the collimator 156 shifting position, the
onsensor locations of the light beams that extends through the angled bores 180, 182 also
shift position. The change in these positions is represented by the differences between
Figures 13A and 13B. Therefore, as part of step 268, based on the end-offrame signals
from the light sensitive transducer 158, controller 48 determines the end-of-frame on
sensor location of the light beams that extend through each of the angled bores 180, 182.
Each of these centroid locations is a point (ANGXp, ANGYPE
         [0129]            In a step 270, controller 48 determines the value of distance
ZADJE in the now loaded state. Step 270 is performed using the same processes that are
employed to perform step 264. As shown in Figure 13B, distance ZADJE is the distance
between the on-sensor locations of the light beams that extend through angled bores 180,
 182. In contrast to distance ZADJU,, which is a constant, the value of distance ZADJE is
variable throughout the operation of force/torque sensor assembly 52.
         [0130]           In a step 272, controller 48 then calculates new slopes of the lines.
With reference to Figure 14B, this means the slope of line 210, the shifted orientation of
line 198 and the slope of line 212, the shifted orientation of line 200 are calculated.
Arbitrarily, slope SE is the angle of the slope of line 210; slope S2 is the angle of the
slope of line 212.
         [0131]           In a step 278, manipulator controller 48 calculates the differences
                                               29

in on-sensor locations of the light beams through one of the angled bores 180, 182. These
differences, XSUP, and YSUPp, for the light beam, are the shifts along the x and y axes,
of the location of the centroid of the light beam through the one of the angled bore 180,
182 on light sensitive transducer 158 between the unloaded state position of the light
beam and the end-of-frame position. Differences XSUPp, and YSUPp, are calculated
according to the following formulas:
             XSUP,    =  ANGXI     - ANGX                   (3)
              YSUP,   =  ANGYpu - ANGYP                     (4)
         [0132]          In a step 280, manipulator controller 48 calculates a second set
of differences representative in the shifts of the light beams that extend through
normal bores 172, 174, 176, 178. These are differences in positions of the light beams
(i.e., positions of centroids) between the start and end of the frame on-sensor beam
locations. These differences are XSFR for the frame position shift along the x-axis
and YSFR for the frame position shift along the y-axis. These differences are
calculated according to the formulas:
              XSFRm   =   STRXs     -  STRX.                (5)
               YSFRm   =  STRYs      - STRY4                (6)
         [0133]          Again, for the first frame of sensor operation, the unloaded state
onsensor locations (STRXu , STRYu ) are employed as the minuends in Equations (5)
and (6), respectively.
         [0134]          A further part of the shifted position calculations of step 280 is the
calculation of the change in slope of at least one of the lines that extends between the on
sensor locations of light beams through the two of the normal bores 172, 174, 176, 178.
This shift, SSFR, is unit less and is calculated according to the formula:
                           SSFRn   =   Ss - SE             (7)
         [0135]          Subscript "n" identifies which of the two lines the shift in angle is
                                               30

associated. As shown in Figures 14A and 14B, the slopes of lines 198 and 200 have
shifted to the slopes of lines 210 and 212, respectively.
        [0136]           Angle delta theta (AO)     is the measured angle shift between the
slope of at least one of the lines measured from the initial frame and the end frame. Angle
delta theta is measured in degrees.
                AO       =       tan-I(SSFRa)               (8)
        [0137]            Controller 48 calculates location differences XSUPp, YSUPp, for
the position shifts of the centroids of the light beams through the angled bores 180, 182.
Location differences XSFR, and YSFR, are calculated for the shifts in position of the
centroids of the light beams through the normal bores 172, 174, 176, 178. Also changes in
slope SSFRn, is calculated. In one construction of the force/torque sensor assembly 52,
four light beams pass through the collimator 156 to the light sensitive transducer 158.
Specifically, these four light beams are beams defined by both angled bores 180, 182 and
one pair of either set of opposed bores 172 and 178, or 174 and 176.
        [0138]            Manipulator controller 48, based on the above differences in beam
locations, inter-beam location distance ZADJ, and shifts in slope between the beam
locations determines the forces and torques that are applied to the force/torque sensor
assembly 52.
        [0139]           In one embodiment, as illustrated in step 282, based on differences
XSFR, and YSFR, and the angle difference SSFRn, the controller first determines
torques T,, Ty and Tz that are applied to the force/torque sensor assembly 52. These three
differences are a function of the torques applied to the force/torque sensor assembly 52.
More specifically, as previously described, it has been shown that Tx, correlates to a shift
in the centroids of the light beams along the y-axis and those shifts are indicated by
YSFR. Ty correlates to a shift in the centroids of the light beams along the x-axis and
those shifts are indicated by XSFR.       Tz correlates to angle difference SSFRn.
        [0140]            Controller 48 executes step 282 by applying the set of these
                                               31

differences as input values into a torque look-up table to which the controller has access.
Each set of these three differences corresponds to a set of torques T,, Ty and Tz stored in
the table. The torques may also be determined using the linear algebra methods described
above based on a multiple linear regression model. The torques from the look-up table or
multiple linear regression model are then used to calculate the forces applied to the
instrument 32. More specifically, the forces applied to the instrument 32 are determined
based on the well known relationship T        = F*r*sinO. These forces can then be translated
to the coordinate system of the force/torque sensor assembly 52 since the instrument 32 is
considered to be part of the same rigid body as the inner hub 70 of the force/torque sensor
assembly 52. The relationship between the forces and torques is such that when forces are
applied along the x, y, or z axes, a torque is always generated at the force/torque sensor
assembly 52 given the configuration of the instrument 32 and its spatial relationship to the
force/torque sensor assembly 52. Sample calculations of the forces in one embodiment are
shown below.
         [0141]         In a step 284 controller 48 first calculates the force Fz. ForceFz is
determined as a function of torque Tz, the position of the instrument 32 relative to the
force/torque sensor assembly 52, and Delta angle theta:
                              F           Tz                (9)
                                     rz sin(AO)
         [0142]         Here, distance rz is the z-axis component of vector R. Delta angle
theta (AO) is the measured angle shift between at least one of the measured lines, as
previously described. Delta angle theta is determined using Equation (8).
         [0143]          In a step 288, the force Fx is calculated. This force is determined by
initially calculating an angle Tx, an x-axis collimator deflection angle. Deflection angle
T, is the angular rotation about the x-axis of the collimator 156 from when the
force/torque sensor assembly 52 is in the unloaded state to the end-of-frame state.
This is the rotation of the x-axis in the y-z plane. In a step 286, deflection angle Tx is
determined according to the formula:
                                                32

                 =   ZADJ  +   ZADj;   - ZADJ                      10)
        S= tan-                XSUPp
         [0144]             Owing to the shift of the collimator 156 along substantially the z
axis, ZADJE        is a variable that is measured after every frame of force/torque sensor
assembly 52 operation. Once deflection angle T, is calculated, force Fx, is determined in
step 288 according to the following formula:
                                      F=       T                   (11)
                                           rxsin(Tx)
         [0145]             In a step 292 the force Fy, is calculated. This force is determined by
initially determining deflection angle            , a y-axis collimator deflection angle. Deflection
angle     , is the angular rotation about the y-axis of the collimator 156 from when the
force/torque sensor assembly 52 is in the unloaded state to the end-of-frame state. This is
the rotation of the y-axis in the x-z plane. In a step 290, deflection angle Ty is determined
according to the formula:
                               ZADJ      - ZADJ
                                                                   (12)
            =t        ZADJ
                                 YSUPp
         [0146]              ZADJE is the same value determined by controller 124 in step
286.
Here, YSUP, is the shift along the y-axis of the location of a light beam through a single
angled bore 180, 182 on light sensitive transducer 158 between the unloaded position and
end-of-frame position. Once Ty is calculated, force Fy, is determined according to the
following formula:
                                 F    -        TY                  (13)
                                           rysin(Ty)
         [0147]             Thus, upon execution of step 292, controller 124 has determined
six variables, the three torques Tx, Ty and Tz, and the three forces Fx, Fy and Fz, applied to
the force/torque sensor assembly 52. The force and torque data are then forwarded to
other modules integral with the manipulator controller 48, step not shown. These other
modules employ the force and torque data to regulate the operation of the manipulator 30.
                                                      33

        [0148]          In a step 300, controller 48 then defines the start-of-frame light
beam locations for the next time frame. These are the start of frame locations XSUP,
YSUP for the light beams through two of the normal bores 172, 174, 176, 178. In step
300, end-of-frame on-sensor light beam locations (STRX, STRY) of each normal bore
light beam for the current frame become the new start-of-frame locations (STRX, STRY)
for the next frame.
        [0149]          In a step 302, end-of-frame inter-beam slopes are set to define a
next frame start-of-frame inter-beam slope. Controller 48 then proceeds to reexecute step
268, to determine the end-of-frame light beam locations for the next frame, now the
current frame. Once step 268 is reexecuted the steps following step 268 are also
reexecuted. Controller 48 thus continually outputs the data describing in essentially real
time the forces and torques that are applied to the force/torque sensor assembly.
        [0150]          In some embodiments, the locations of the light beams for the
normal bores 172, 174, 176, 178 and angled bores 180, 182 in the loaded state, for each
frame, are compared to their locations in the unloaded state to determine forces and
torques, as opposed to being compared to their locations at the end of the last time frame.
Thus, the start-of-frame locations of the light beams for each computation are the
locations of the light beams in the unloaded state with all determinations of forces and
torques during operation being considered from the unloaded state to determine total
forces and torques applied relative to the unloaded state as opposed to measuring
incremental forces and torques applied in each time frame.
        [0151]          In other embodiments, a torque sensor assembly is provided where,
based on differences XSFR, and YSFR, and the angle difference SSFRn, the controller
only determines torques Tx, Ty and Tz that are applied to the torque sensor assembly
wherein the torque sensor assembly has the same features as the force/torque sensor
assembly 52 with the only difference being that only torques are measured.
        [0152]          Figures 20 and 21 depict an alternative collimator 156A with
multiple sets of angled bores 180A, 182A.
                                            34

         [0153]         Figures 22-24 depict alternative embodiments of the diverter plate
56. These alternative diverter plates are substantially the same as diverter plate 56, but
with different spring arrangements. For example, in Figure 22, the serpentine springs
 104A have been rotated ninety degrees. As a result, the inner hub 70A is movably coupled
to the outer hub 72A by three spring devices 102A including three serpentine springs
 104A and three leaf springs 106A. Pins 120A are also positioned to act as stops for the
serpentine springs 104A.
         [0154]         In Figure 23, three spring devices 120B are shown that include leaf
springs 106B similar to the leaf springs 106, but the serpentine springs 104 have been
replaced with cylindrical hollow resilient members surrounding elongated pins 120B that
act as stops for the cylindrical hollow resilient members. In this embodiment, the first
stage of spring displacement is to compress the cylindrical hollow resilient member
against the pin 120B. This stops the first stage and then the second stage continues by
flexing the leaf spring 106C. Thus, the leaf spring 106C is configured to have a spring
rate that prevents substantially flexing until the first stage is complete.
         [0155]         In Figure 24, three spring devices 120C are shown that include leaf
springs 106C similar to the leaf springs 106, but the serpentine springs 104 have been
replaced with two cylindrical hollow resilient members arranged in series. Elongated pins
 120C act as stops for these cylindrical hollow resilient members.
         [0156]         In some embodiments, structural members other than the disclosed
diverter plate may serve as the transducer that, in response to the application of force and
torque, selectively direct the light emitted towards the light sensitive transducer 158. In
other words, structural sensor members other than the inner hub 70 may move relative to
the base plate 58 to selectively direct the light emitted towards the light sensitive
transducer 158.
         [0157]          The tines 78 may number less than three or more than three. In
other versions, tines 78 may be dimensioned to inhibit unnecessary flexure of the inner
hub 70 within the force/torque sensor assembly 52.
                                              35

         [0158]         In some embodiments, the force/torque sensor assembly 52 is part
of the manipulator 30. In other embodiments, the force/torque sensor assembly 52 is a
separate assembly acting between the manipulator 30 and the instrument 32.
         [0159]         In some embodiments, the outer hub 72 is fixed directly to the
distal end component 138 of the linkage assembly 40 and acts as the base plate for the
force/torque sensor assembly. In this embodiment, the light sensitive transducer 158 may
be recessed in a pocket in the distal end component 138 of the linkage assembly 40.
         [0160]         In some embodiments, collimator is square in shape. In these
embodiments, inner hub bore 80 is configured to be square in shape so that a
squareshaped collimator may seat within inner hub.
         [0161]         In some embodiments, the abutment of folds 114 against the pins
 120 prevents plastic deformation of the pleats 116. Consequently when forces and/or
torques are removed and then new forces and/or torques applied, the serpentine springs
 104 will again undergo expansion or compression that is linearly related to the magnitude
of the applied forces and torques in the first or second stage of spring displacement.
         [0162]         Several embodiments have been discussed in the foregoing
description. However, the embodiments discussed herein are not intended to be
exhaustive or limit the invention to any particular form. The terminology which has been
used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than of limitation. Many

         [0163]         Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless
the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises"
and "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or
group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of
integers or steps.
