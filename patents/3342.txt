         AN INTRODUCER FOR INTRODUCTION OF A PROSTHESIS INTO A LUMEN
                                               OF A PATIENT
FIELD
[0001] The present disclosure relates generally to the field of medical devices. Particular embodiments
are related to medical devices that are deployable into bodily lumens including vascular systems.
BACKGROUND
[0002] A variety of medical devices have been developed for endovascular repair. For instance, various
methods and devices have been developed to repair aneurysmal or occluded branches of the aorta. Many
such devices include tubular introducers having internal passages, sometimes referred to as introducer
catheters, that include a seal and/or valve to retard or stop blood flow through their internal passages. For
instance, introducer catheters are known to employ Captor T M valves. Introducers are typically designed to
track along a guide wire and some introducers are designed to seal against both small diameter guide
wires and larger diameter portions of delivery devices.
[0003] Existing introducers and their seals/valves suffer a number of shortcomings. For instance, they
leak blood more than is desirable. With some devices, this can be exacerbated or caused by storage before
use. This is because seals are subject to "taking a set" or being deformed during prolonged storage. Where
seals are deformed during storage, they may take a significant period of time to (or never) recover their
optimum condition.
[0004] Another characteristic of many existing introducers and their seals or valves is the level of both
static and dynamic sliding friction that resists relative movement between the introducers and delivery
devices passing through them. In many applications it may be desirable to minimise or at least provide a
low level of static and/or dynamic friction so as to assist a surgeon with fine manipulations of a delivery
device passing through an introducer.
[0005] There is a need to minimise blood leakage through introducers, especially blood leakage around
guide wires used in endovascular procedures. There is also a need to provide introducers that facilate easy
manipulation of delivery devices passing through them.

[0006] Throughout this specification, the term "distal" with respect to a portion of the aorta, a
deployment device or an endograft means the end of the aorta, deployment device or endograft further
away in the direction of blood flow from the heart and the term "proximal" means the portion of the aorta
deployment device or end of the endograft nearer to the heart in the direction of blood flow. When
applied to other vessels, similar terms such as caudal and cranial should be understood.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0033] Referring to Figures 1 and 2, an introducer 10 for introduction of a prosthesis, such as the
prosthesis 5 shown in Figure 6, into a lumen of a patient is shown. The introducer 10 comprises a sheath
20, most clearly shown in Figure 1, having a proximal end 22 and a distal end 28. A housing 30 is
mounted to the distal end 28 of the sheath 20. The housing has a passage 35 therethrough as is most
clearly shown in Figure 2. The passage 35 is adapted to receive a delivery assembly, such as the delivery
assembly 100 shown in Figure 6. A port 34 is provided for introducing flushing fluid. The port 34
communicates with the passage 35. The housing 30 shown in Figure 2 is made from a plurality of parts,
including a distal housing portion 38. In other embodiments, more or less component parts may be used to
form a suitable housing 30.
[0034] A liquid absorbing seal 50 can be seen in Figure 2. The liquid absorbing seal 50 for sealably
receiving a delivery assembly, such as the delivery assembly 100 referred to above. The liquid absorbing
seal 50 is disposed within the housing 30 distally of the port 34. In use, introduction of a flushing fluid
through the port 34 into the passage 35 results in absorption of a portion of the flushing fluid into the
liquid absorbing seal, thereby swelling the liquid absorbing seal.

                                                       6
[0035] The liquid absorbing seal 50 comprises a hydrogel. More specifically, the hydrogel comprises a
lubricious polymer. A suitable lubricious polymer may include a hydrophilic thermoplastic polyurethane
elastomer. The flushing fluid, blood, or other fluids containing water, improve the lubricity of the seal
promoting a low coefficient of friction.
[0036] In other embodiments, others suitable materials having the liquid-absorbing properties that result
in expansion may include, but are not limited to the following: hydrocolloids that are polymer
compositions of substantially water-insoluble, slightly cross-linked, partially neutralized polymers
prepared from unsaturated polymerizable acid group-containing monomers and cross-linking agents; or
any other suitable liquid absorbing materials known in the art.
[0037] Referring to Figures 3A and 3B, it can be seen that the housing 50 includes a fluid receiving
chamber hole 55 which has a larger internal diameter than the external diameter of the pusher 110. This
allows flushing fluid entering the port 34 via a tube 33 to reach the liquid absorbing seal 50. Once the
liquid absorbing seal 50 has absorbed flushing fluid, it expands and becomes more lubricious. This results
in the liquid absorbing seal 50 sealing effectively against the outer diameter of the pusher 110, while at
the same time allowing relative movement between the pusher 110 and the seal 50.
[0038] A cap 60 is provided to retain the liquid absorbing seal 50, as illustrated in Figures 3A and 3B.
The cap 60 snaps into place within the housing 30. The cap 30 presents a holed disc shaped face to the
liquid absorbing seal 50 as can be seen in Figure 2. Hole 54 through the holed disc shaped face allows
access through the seal 50 to the fluid receiving chamber hole 55.
[0039] In another embodiment of the invention, illustrated in Figures 4, 5A and 5B, an introducer 10
further comprises a compression assembly 70. The compression assembly 70 is operable to compress the
liquid absorbing seal 50. The compression assembly 70 comprises an actuator 71 and a compression
segment 80. The actuator 71 comprises a rotatable body. The rotatable body is threadably connected to
the housing 30. Rotation of the rotatable body pushes the compression segments 80 against the liquid
absorbing seal 50 thereby compressing the liquid absorbing seal 50.
[0040] The compression segment 80 is a separate component to the rotatable body. The compression
segment and the rotatable body are mutually arranged and constructed to allow relative rotation.

                                                       7
[0041] With the embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 4, 5A and 5B, the compression
assembly 70 allows in the surgeon or another member of the surgical team to manually adjust the level of
compression of the seal 50. For instance, manual adjustment may be desirable when sealing over a fine
guide wire such as the guide wire 7 illustrated in Figure 6. Depending on the characteristics of the seal 50
and on the hydrogel employed, the compression assembly 70 may be of assistance.
[0042] Turning now to Figure 6, an introducer according to either the first embodiment of the invention
described above with reference to Figures 2, 3A and 3B or with reference to the second embodiment of
the invention described above with reference to Figures 4, 5A and 5B is shown as part of a delivery
assembly according to the invention. The delivery assembly 100 comprises a guide wire catheter 120
having a tip 130 mounted to a proximal end 122 thereof. A distal delivery member 110, which could be
referred to as a pusher, is mounted around the guide wire catheter 120 and is located distal of the tip 130.
A prosthesis receiving portion 140 is provided between the tip 130 and the distal delivery member 110.
The delivery assembly 100 is slidably mounted through the introducer 10. A handle 150 is manipulable to
slide the distal delivery member (pusher) 110 through the introducer 10.
[0043] An example of the use of embodiments of the invention will now be described.
[0044] An introducer 10, together with a delivery assembly 100, as illustrated in Figure 6 read in
conjunction with Figures 2, 3A and 3B, is provided packaged and ready for delivery to a hospital.
[0045] As a first step, the introducer 10 together with the delivery assembly 100 is unpackaged ready for
use. A flushing fluid is then delivered via the tube 33 to the introducer 10. The flushing fluid displaces air
within the introducer 10 and the delivery device 100. The flushing fluid is also able to reach the seal 50
through the passage 35, the fluid receiving chamber 32 within the housing 30 and the fluid receiving
chamber hole 55. The flushing fluid travels through the fluid receiving chamber hole 55 and wets the seal
50. The flushing fluid also pushes air out of the assembly through to the proximal end 22 of the introducer
10.
[0046] At this stage, the seal 50 will tend to absorb some of the flushing fluid and will become more
lubricious promoting a lower coefficient of friction.

                                                       8
[0047] The introducer 10 can then be introduced to an artery of a patient for instance. For example, the
introducer may be inserted through an incision in the femoral artery using the Seldinger method.
[0048] Once in position adjacent the target site within the patient (for instance the prosthesis 5 shown in
Figure 6 may be positioned to repair an aneurysmal portion of the aorta), the surgeon may manipulate the
handle 150 so as to slide the pusher 110 through the introducer 10.
[0049] The liquid absorbing seal 50 described above provides for a very low coefficient of friction
between an outer surface of the pusher 110 and an inner surface of the seal 50. This assists the surgeon in
fine manipulations and generally facilitates use of the introducer 10 and the delivery assembly 100.
[0050] With some procedures, it may be necessary or desirable to leave the introducer 10 in place while
extracting the delivery device 100. After the delivery device 100 has been removed, the seal 50 seals
against the guide wire 7, as illustrated in Figure 3B. The ability of the seal 50 to seal against the relatively
large diameter pusher 110 and against the relatively small diameter guide wire 7, as is shown respectively
in Figures 3A and 3B, is important to minimise blood loss.
[0051] Blood in contact with the seal 50 contains fluid that is absorbable by the seal 50. This ensures that
the seal 50 remains in an expanded and lubricous state during an endovascular procedure.
[0052] A further delivery device, or the same delivery device, may be slid along the guide wire 7 so as to
enter and pass through the introducer 10. Figure 3B shows a tip 130 of an introducer just before or after
insertion.
[0053] Throughout this specification various indications have been given as to the scope of this invention
but the invention is not limited to any one of these but may reside in two or more of these combined
together. The examples are given for illustration only and not for limitation.
[0054] Throughout this specification and the claims that follow unless the context requires otherwise, the
words 'comprise' and 'include' and variations such as 'comprising' and 'including' will be understood to
imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or
