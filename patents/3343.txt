                                  BOX LUBRICATION PUMP
                                         BACKGROUND
             Box lubrication pumps are modular pumps that provide pump-to-point lubrication,
 5 allowing consumers to adapt a lubrication system to an already existing system or
   machine without replacing or overhauling the system or machine. Box lubrication pumps
   are commonly used in manufacturing, refining, and gas transmission applications to
   lubricate piston assemblies and high speed bearings. They are also used in the lumber
   industry to lubricate and cool blades, guides, edgers, planers, and band saws. They have
10 also been used in the rubber industry to lubricate dust stop seals on mixers. Box
   lubrication pumps are cost-effective and robust due to their simple, self-lubricating
   design.
             In the prior art, box lubrication pumps are available in three different
   configurations: pressure fed, gravity fed, and suction fed. Each configuration includes as
15 many as one to twenty four individual pumps mounted to a reservoir box, each pump
   having a rocker arm assembly located inside of the reservoir box. A motor-driven
   camshaft assembly located inside of the reservoir box actuates the rocker arm assembly,
   which in turn actuates a piston inside of each pump. The camshaft assembly, the rocker
   arm assembly, and the interface between the rocker arm assembly and piston are
20 submerged in and lubricated by fluid housed inside the reservoir box. As the piston inside
   each pump is actuated by the rocker arm assembly, the piston pushes the fluid through a
   discharge outlet of each pump. In pressure fed configured pumps, fluid is pressure fed to
   the piston through an inlet line connected to a second reservoir separate from the reservoir
   box to which each pump is mounted. In gravity fed configured pumps, fluid is gravity fed
25 to the piston through an inlet line connected to a second reservoir located above the
   pumps and separate from the reservoir box to which each pump is mounted. In a suction
   fed configured pump, the piston of each pump draws fluid from the reservoir box to
   which the pumps are mounted through a suction tube which extends from each pump into
   the reservoir box and into the fluid housed inside the reservoir box. In summary, gravity
30 fed configured or a pressure fed configured pumps are attached to a reservoir box that
   lubricates their respective rocker arm assemblies yet they pump fluid that is located in a
   second and separate reservoir, while suction fed configured pumps pump fluid from the
   same reservoir that lubricates their rocker arm assemblies.

             While the rocker arm assemblies of each pump configuration are lubricated by the
   fluid inside of the reservoir box, the pistons in each pump configuration are lubricated by
   the fluid that the pistons pump. In the suction fed configured pumps, the pistons are
   lubricated by fluid housed inside the reservoir box as they pump the same fluid out of the
 5 reservoir box. In pressure fed configured or gravity fed configured pumps, the pistons are
   lubricated by the same fluid that they pump out of the second reservoir. In all three pump
   configurations, the fluid lubricating the pistons leaks off the pistons and drains into the
   reservoir box. Because the fluid lubricating the pistons leaks into the reservoir box, the
   fluid inside the reservoir box must be the same kind of fluid as the fluid pumped by the
10 pistons. Thus, in the case of the pressure fed configured or gravity fed configured pumps,
   the second reservoir must house the same kind of lubricating fluid as the reservoir box to
   which the pumps are mounted.
             Because prior art box lubrication pumps must house the same kind of fluid inside
   their reservoir boxes that they pump, the fluid selected and housed is the fluid with the
15 properties that meets the lubrication needs of the end activity to which the fluid is
   pumped by the box lubrication pumps. In many cases, the lubricating needs required by
   the end activity are different from the lubrication needs of the box lubrication pumps
   themselves, yet the box lubrication pumps must make due self-lubricating themselves
   with the fluid needed by the end activity, even when that fluid is less-than-ideal for the
20 lubrication needs of the box lubrication pumps. Because the box lubrication pumps in
   these cases are self-lubricating with less-than-ideal fluid, they experience reduced
   performance, increased wear, and reduced life.
                                             SUMMARY
             According to the present invention, a box lubricator that includes a pump with a
25 piston housing and piston. The piston housing extends from a first end to a second end,
   and includes a bore extending through the piston housing from the first end of the piston
   housing to the second end of the piston housing. The piston housing also includes a recess
   disposed at the second end of the piston housing, the recess being concentric with the
   bore and comprising a diameter larger than a diameter of the bore. The piston is disposed
30 inside the bore of the piston housing. At least one elastomeric seal may be disposed inside
   the recess of the piston housing and around the piston.
             In another embodiment of the present invention, a piston assembly includes a
   piston housing with a first end opposite a second end, a bore extending completely
   through the piston housing from the first end to the second end of the piston housing, and
                                                  2

   a piston housing inlet intersecting the bore between the first end and the second end of the
   piston housing. The piston housing also includes an outlet disposed at the second end of
   the piston housing and in fluid communication with the bore. A piston is disposed inside
   the bore of the piston housing and has a first end opposite a second end. The piston also
 5 has a fluid passage formed inside the piston that fluidly connects the piston housing inlet
   with the piston housing outlet. A first recess is formed inside the first end of the piston
   and is in fluid communication with the fluid passage. The first recess has a diameter
   smaller than a diameter of the piston yet larger than a diameter of the fluid passage. A
   check ball and a retaining guide are disposed inside the first recess. The retaining guide
10 limits displacement of the check ball to the first recess.
             In another embodiment of the present invention, a pump includes a support post
   with a first end opposite a second end, and a piston housing that also includes a first end
   to a second end. The piston housing also includes a bore extending through the piston
   housing from the first end to the second end of the piston housing. A piston is disposed
15 inside the bore of the piston housing and includes a first end opposite a second end. The
   pump also includes a rocker arm assembly extending from the second end of the support
   post to the second end of the piston. The rocker arm assembly is pivotally connected to
   the second end of the support post and is also connected to the second end of the piston
   by a ball and socket joint.

15 38, first endwall 42, second endwall 44 in an open box geometry such that first sidewall
   36 is parallel to second sidewall 38 and first endwall 42 is parallel to second endwall 44.
   Fluid reservoir 20 top plate 32 is joined to first sidewall 36, second sidewall 38, first
   endwall 42, and second endwall 44 opposite bottom surface 40 to form fluid reservoir 20
   in a closed box geometry. Top plate 40 of fluid reservoir 20 includes cap 46 which can be
20 removed to fill fluid reservoir 20 with fluid and replaced once fluid reservoir 20 carries
   the desired amount of fluid. Sight gauge 50 is disposed on first sidewall 36 and permits
   visual inspection of the level of fluid inside fluid reservoir 20. Drain plug 48 may be
   connected to first sidewall 36, second sidewall 38, bottom surface 40, first endwall 42, or
   second endwall 44 of fluid reservoir 20. In the embodiment of FIGS. 1 and 2, drain plug
25 48 is connected to second endwall 44. Fluid inside of fluid reservoir 20 can be drained
   from fluid reservoir 20 by removing drain plug 48 from second endwall 44.
             Openings 34 (shown in FIGS. 3 and 4) are formed in top plate 32 of fluid
   reservoir 20 and sized to receive pumps 24 and permit pumps 24 to extend into fluid
   reservoir 20. Pumps 24 are mounted to top plate 32 of fluid reservoir 20 by bolts 26. In
30 the embodiment of FIGS. 1 and 2, six openings 34 are formed into top plate 32 and six
   pumps 24 are mounted to top plate 32 of fluid reservoir 20. Though the embodiments of
   FIGS. 1 and 2 show six pumps 24, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that top
   plate 32 may include less than six openings 34 or more than six openings 34, and that less
   than six pumps 24 or more than six pumps 24 may be mounted to top plate 32 of fluid

   Torque transmitter 14 and gear reducer 16 may also be mounted onto mounting base 22
   inline with motor 12 and fluid reservoir 20.
             As described below in the description of FIGS. 3, 4, 9 and 10, camshaft 18
10 contacts pumps 24 inside fluid reservoir 20 and rotation of camshaft 18 by motor 12
   actuates pumps 24. Lubrication lines 28 fluidly connect pumps 24 to lubrication points 30
   such that pumps 24, when actuated by motor 12 and camshaft 18, may deliver fluid to
   lubrication points 30 through lubrication lines 28. Each pump 24 is individually
   connected to one lubrication line 28, and each lubrication line 28 is connected to one or
15 more lubrication points 30. Pumps 24 may pump fluid from inside reservoir 20 to
   lubrication points 30, or pumps 24 may pump fluid from a different reservoir than the
   fluid reservoir 20 to lubrication points 30. The fluid in the different reservoir may be
   different in composition from the fluid inside fluid reservoir 20.

   Camshaft 18 extends horizontally into fluid reservoir 20. Cam 52 is disposed on camshaft
    18 inside fluid reservoir 20 and adjacent pump 24. When pump 24 is mounted onto top
   plate 32, second surface 84 of main body 56 of pump 24 is next to top plate 32 and covers
   opening 34 of top plate 32 of fluid reservoir 20. Main body 56 of pump 24 extends
 5 outside of fluid reservoir 20 from second surface 84 to first surface 82. Main body 56
   may be a bracket. Bolts 26 extend through first surface 82 and second surface 84 of main
   body 56 and through top plate 32 of fluid reservoir 20 and anchor main body 56 of pump
   24 to top plate 32 of fluid reservoir 20. In the embodiment of FIG. 3, there are two bolts
   26 anchoring main body 56 of pump 24 to top plate 32 of fluid reservoir 20. Support post
10 58 extends from second surface 84 of main body 56, through opening 34 formed in top
   plate 32 of fluid reservoir 20, to support post second end 88 inside fluid reservoir 20.
    Support post 58 also extends outside of fluid reservoir 20, past first surface 82 of main
   body 56, to support post first end 86. Support post 58 may be integral with main body 56
   or support post 58 may be manufactured separate from main body 56 and subsequently
15 connected to main body 56. Support post 58 may be cylindrical.
             Piston housing 60 is in close proximity to support post 58 and extends from
   second surface 84 of main body 56, through opening 34 formed in top plate 32 of fluid
   reservoir 20, to piston housing second end 92 inside fluid reservoir 20. Piston housing
   second end 92 is disposed inside fluid reservoir 20 directly above camshaft 18 and cam
20 52. Piston housing 60 also extends outside of fluid reservoir 20, past first surface 82 of
   main body 56, to piston housing first end 90. Piston housing 60 may be integral with main
   body 56 or piston housing 60 may be manufactured separate from main body 56 and
   subsequently connected to main body 56. Piston housing 60 may be cylindrical.
   Adjustment screw 74 extends through first surface 82 and second surface 84 of main body
25 56, through opening 34 of top plate 32 of fluid reservoir 20, and into fluid reservoir 20.
   Adjustment screw 74 is in close proximity to support post 58 opposite piston housing 60.
             Piston 62 is disposed inside piston housing 60 and partially extends from piston
   housing second end 92 into fluid reservoir 20. Pivot joint 66 connects rocker arm
   assembly 64 to support post second end 88. Rocker arm assembly 64 extends from pivot
30 joint 66 and support post second end 88 towards piston housing 60 and extends between
   piston housing second end 92 and cam 52 of camshaft 18. Rocker arm assembly 64 also
   extends from pivot joint 66 and support post second end 88 towards adjustment screw 74.
   The distance between second surface 84 of main body 56 and piston housing second end
   92 is generally shorter than the distance between second surface 84 of main body 56 and
                                                  6

   support post second end 88, thereby allowing rocker arm assembly 64 the ability to rotate
   on pivot joint 66 and support post second end 88. Support post second end 88 also
   extends into fluid reservoir 20 further than adjustment screw 74 so that rocker arm
   assembly 64 is capable of rotating on pivot joint 66 and support post second end 88. Ball
 5 and socket joint 68 connects piston 62 to rocker arm assembly 64 between piston housing
   second end 92 and cam 52. Spring 80 is disposed around piston housing 60 and extends
   between second surface 84 of main body 56 and rocker arm assembly 64. When cam shaft
   18 is rotated, cam 52 and spring 80 move piston 62 between a down stroke position and
   an up stroke position. Adjustment screw 74 regulates the distance in which spring 80 may
10 push piston 62 down towards cam 52 by limiting the distance rocker arm assembly 64
   may rotate on support post second end 88.
             Pump inlet tube 70 is connected to support post second end 88 and extends away
   from support post second end 88 further into fluid reservoir 20. Pump inlet strainer 72 is
   connected to pump inlet tube 70 opposite support post second end 88 and strains fluid 54
15 that enters pump 24. Fluid 54 is disposed inside fluid reservoir 20 and typically
   maintained at a level sufficient to submerge pump inlet strainer 72, most of pump inlet
   tube 70, camshaft 18, cam 52, and rocker arm assembly 64. As described below in FIG. 4,
   pump inlet tube 70 fluidly communicates with piston housing 60 and piston 62 through
   support post 58 thereby providing fluid 54 a path to travel from fluid reservoir 20 to
20 piston housing 60. Sight well 76 is connected to support post first end 86 and permits
   visual inspection of fluid 54 traveling through support post 58 to piston housing 60. Pump
   outlet assembly 78 is connected to piston housing first end 90. In the embodiment of FIG.
   3, piston 62 pumps fluid 54 from fluid reservoir 20, through pump inlet strainer 72, pump
   inlet tube 70, support post 58, and piston housing 60, and into pump outlet assembly 78.
25 Pump outlet assembly directs fluid 54 away from pump 24.

10 assembled as discussed above with reference to FIG. 3. Pump inlet passage 98 is formed
   inside support post 58 and extends through support post 58 from support post second end
   88 to support post first end 86. Pump inlet tube 70 is connected to support post second
   end 88 and extends away from support post second end 88 further into fluid reservoir 20.
   Pump inlet strainer 72 is connected to pump inlet tube 70 opposite support post second
15 end 88 and strains fluid 54 that enters pump 24. Fluid pathway 100 is also formed inside
   support post 58 and extends from support post first end 86 towards support post second
   end 88, exiting support post 58 between first surface 82 and second surface 84 of main
   body 56 of pump 24. Drip tube 94 is connected inside pump inlet passage 98 at support
   post first end 86 and extends away from support post first end 86 while curving back in a
20 candy-cane fashion towards support post first end 86 and fluid pathway 100 without
   contacting fluid pathway 100. Sight well 76 is connected to support post first end 86 and
   covers support post first end 86 and drip tube 94. Sight well 76 includes window 116
   which is transparent and permits visual inspection of fluid 54 traveling through support
   post 58 and drip tube 94 to piston housing 60. When fluid 54 enters pump 24, fluid 54
25 travels into pump inlet tube 70 through pump inlet strainer 72. Fluid 54 passes from pump
   inlet tube 70 into support post 58 through pump inlet passage 98. Fluid 54 then travels
   through pump inlet passage 98 and up into drip tube 94 where it will exit drip tube 94 and
   fall back into support post 58 through fluid pathway 100. Fluid pathway 100 directs fluid
   54 towards piston housing 60.
30           Bore 102 is formed in piston housing 60 and extends from piston housing second
   end 92 through piston housing first end 90. Piston housing inlet 104 is formed in piston
   housing 60 between piston housing first end 90 and piston housing second end 92, and
   intersects bore 102. When piston housing 60 is attached to main body 56 of pump 24,
   piston housing inlet 104 is disposed on piston housing 60 between first surface 82 and
                                                 8

   second surface 84 of main body 56 adjacent to fluid pathway 100 of support post 58 and
   fluidly communicates with fluid pathway 100 through a passage within main body 56. In
   the embodiment of FIG. 4, fluid pathway 100 may extend into main body 56 between
   support post 58 and piston housing 60 to connect with piston housing inlet 104. Piston
 5 housing outlet 106 is disposed on piston housing first end 90 and may be integral with
   bore 102 at piston housing first end 90. Pump outlet assembly 78 is connected to piston
   housing first end 90. Pump outlet passage 118 extends through pump outlet assembly 78
   and is next to and concentric with piston housing outlet 106. Second check valve 120 and
   third check valve 122 are disposed inside pump outlet passage 118 of pump outlet
10 assembly 78.
             Piston 62 is disposed inside bore 102 of piston housing 60 and extends in a
   generally cylindrical geometry from piston first end 108 to piston second end 110. Piston
   first end 108 is disposed inside bore 102 proximate piston housing first end 90 and piston
   second end 110 extends out of bore 102 through piston housing second end 92 into fluid
15 reservoir 20. Fluid passage 112 is formed in piston 62 and extends from piston first end
   108 towards piston second end 110, exiting piston 62 into bore 102 between first surface
   82 and second surface 84 of main body 56 of pump 24. First check valve 114, which is
   discussed in greater detail below with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7, is formed inside piston
   first end 108 and is aligned with and fluidly communicates with fluid passage 112 inside
20 piston 62. Seal assembly 96 is disposed inside piston housing 60 and around piston 62
   between piston housing inlet 104 and piston housing second end 92. Seal assembly 96,
   which is discussed in greater detail below with reference to FIG. 8, fluidly seals piston
   housing 60 and piston 62 such that fluid 54 travels through pump 24 without leaking back
   into fluid reservoir 20 through piston 62 and piston housing 60.
25           When piston 62 in the embodiment of FIG. 4 actuates between an up and down
   stroke, fluid 54 in fluid reservoir 20 enters pump 24 through pump inlet strainer 72 and
   pump inlet tube 70. Fluid 54 passes from pump inlet tube 70 into support post 58 through
   pump inlet passage 98. Fluid 54 then travels through pump inlet passage 98 and up into
   drip tube 94 where it will exit drip tube 94 and fall back into support post 58 through fluid
30 pathway 100. Fluid pathway 100 directs fluid 54 into piston housing 60 through piston
   housing inlet 104, and piston housing inlet 104 directs fluid 54 into bore 102. When
   piston 62 is in a down stroke position, check valve 114 opens and fluid 54 travels through
   fluid passage 112 inside piston 62 where it crosses first check valve 114 and exits piston
   62, thereby being trapped between first check valve 114 and second check valve 120.

   3447701vl

   When piston 62 moves to an up stroke position, first check valve 114 closes so that fluid
   54 may not pass back into fluid passage 112. Fluid 54 then travels through piston housing
   outlet 106, into pump outlet passage 118 of pump outlet assembly 78 where fluid 54
   opens and passes across second check valve 120 and third check valve 122. When piston
 5 62 moves back to a down stroke position, second check valve 120 and third check valve
   122 close, thereby preventing fluid 54 that has traveled outside of pump 24 from
   reentering pump 24 through pump outlet passage 112.
             Adjustment screw 74 extends through first surface 82 and second surface 84 of
   main body 56, through opening 34 of top plate 32 of fluid reservoir 20, and into fluid
10 reservoir 20. Adjustment screw 74 is in close proximity to support post 58 opposite piston
   housing 60. Pivot joint 66 connects rocker arm assembly 64 to support post second end
   88. Rocker arm assembly 64 extends from pivot joint 66 and support post second end 88
   towards piston housing 60 and extends between piston housing second end 92 and cam 52
   of camshaft 18. Rocker arm assembly 64 also extends from pivot joint 66 and support
15 post second end 88 towards adjustment screw 74. Pivot joint 66 permits rocker arm
   assembly 64 to rotate on support post second end 88. Ball and socket joint 68, which is
   discussed in greater detail below with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10, connects piston
   second end 110 to rocker arm assembly 64 between piston housing second end 92 and
   cam 52. Spring 80 is disposed around piston housing 60 and extends between second
20 surface 84 of main body 56 and rocker arm assembly 64. When cam shaft 18 is rotated,
   cam 52 and spring 80 move piston 62 between a suction position and a discharge position.
   Adjustment screw 74 regulates the distance in which spring 80 may pull piston 62 down
   towards cam 52 by limiting the distance rocker arm assembly 64 may rotate on support
   post second end 88. Regulating the distance in which spring 80 may pull piston 62 down
25 towards cam 52 regulates the maximum displacement of piston 62 inside piston housing
   60 and amount of fluid 54 piston 62 pulls into pump 24 per unit measure of time.
             Fluid 54 inside fluid reservoir 20 is typically maintained at a level sufficient to
   submerge pump inlet strainer 72, most of pump inlet tube 70, camshaft 18, cam 52, and
   rocker arm assembly 64. As described above, the embodiment of pump 24 in FIG. 4
30 pumps fluid 54 out fluid reservoir 20. As pump 24 pumps fluid 54 out of fluid reservoir
   20, pump 24 self lubricates piston 62 with fluid 54. Because pump 24 as embodied in
   FIG. 4 pumps fluid 54 out of fluid reservoir 20, pump 24 is a suction fed pump. Pump 24
   may also be configured to be a gravity fed pump or a pressure fed pump. In a gravity fed
   configuration or a pressure fed configuration, pump 24 would pump a fluid other than
                                                 10
   3447701vl

   fluid 54 in fluid reservoir 20. This different fluid would be gravity delivered or pressure
   delivered to pump 24 from some other reservoir and not fluid reservoir 20. This different
   fluid would be fed directly into fluid pathway 100 at support post first end 86. Because
   this different fluid would be fed directly into fluid pathway 100 at support post first end
 5 86, pump 24 in a gravity fed configuration or a pressure fed configuration will not include
   pump inlet strainer 72, pump inlet tube 70, and pump inlet passage 98, and may not
   include drip tube 94. Seal assembly 96 fluidly seals piston housing 60 and piston 62 such
   that this different fluid from some other reservoir travels through pump 24 without
   leaking into fluid reservoir 20 through piston 62 and piston housing 60 and mixing with
10 fluid 54. Thus, camshaft 18, cam 52, and rocker arm assembly 64 of pump 24 are able to
   lubricate in fluid 54 inside fluid reservoir 20 while pump 24, in a gravity fed or pressure
   fed configuration, pumps a fluid different from fluid 54 without the two fluids mixing and
   contaminating one another.
             FIG. 5 is an enlarged cross sectional view of pump 24 of FIG. 4 at support post
15 first end 86 and piston housing first end 90. Pump 24 pumps fluid 54 and includes main
   body 56, support post 58, piston housing 60, piston 62, sight well 76, pump outlet
   assembly 78, and drip tube 94. In the embodiment of FIG. 5, main body 56 includes first
   surface 82 and second surface 84 (shown in FIG. 4). In the embodiment of FIG. 5,
   support post 58 includes support post first end 86, support post second end 88 (shown in
20 FIG. 4), pump inlet passage 98, and fluid pathway 100. In the embodiment of FIG. 5,
   piston housing 60 includes piston housing first end 90, piston housing second end 92
   (shown in FIG. 4), bore 102, piston housing inlet 104, and piston housing outlet 106. In
   the embodiment of FIG. 5, piston 62 includes piston first end 108, piston second end 110
   (shown in FIG. 4), fluid passage 112, fluid passage inlet 113, first check valve 114,
25 reduced diameter portion 124, and first recess 126. In the embodiment of FIG. 5, sight
   well 76 includes window 116. In the embodiment of FIG. 5, pump outlet assembly 78
   includes pump outlet passage 118, second check valve 120, and third check valve 122.
             Components of like numbering as the components disclosed in FIG. 4 are
   assembled as discussed above with reference to FIG. 4. In the embodiment of FIG. 5,
30 piston 62 is in a down stroke position. First recess 126 is formed in piston first end 108
   and has a diameter larger than a diameter of fluid passage 112 yet smaller than a diameter
   of piston 62. First recess 126 fluidly communicates with fluid passage 112 and piston
   housing outlet 106. First check valve 114 is disposed inside first recess 126 and permits
   fluid 54 to flow out of piston first end 108 into piston housing outlet 106 while preventing
                                                  11

   fluid 54 from reentering fluid passage 112 through piston first end 108. Reduced diameter
   portion 124 is formed on piston 62 between piston first end 108 and piston second end
   110, and intersects fluid passage 112 at fluid passage inlet 113. As piston 62 moves from
   a down stroke position to an upstroke position and back again, reduced diameter portion
 5 124 ensures that fluid passage 112 remains fluidly connected at all times to piston
   housing inlet 104 by providing a constant fluid path between piston housing inlet 104 and
   fluid passage inlet 113 inside piston 62. When piston 62 strokes downward, piston 62
   creates a vacuum inside piston housing outlet 106. The vacuum created by piston 62 in
   the down stroke position opens first check valve 114 inside piston first end 108 and pulls
10 fluid 54 into pump inlet passage 98 inside support post 58, then across drip tube 94, then
   across fluid pathway 100 inside support post 58 and main body 56. The vacuum the pulls
   fluid 54 across piston housing inlet 104, then between bore 102 and reduced diameter
   portion 124 of piston 62, then into fluid passage inlet 113 and across fluid passage 112,
   then across first check valve 114 where fluid 54 exits piston 62 and accumulates inside
15 piston housing outlet 106. Once fluid 54 has finished accumulating inside piston housing
   outlet 106, first check valve 114 closes and piston 62 begins to stroke upward. As piston
   62 strokes upward, piston first end 108 pushes accumulated fluid 54 out of piston housing
   outlet 106, into pump outlet passage 118 of pump outlet assembly 78. The force of fluid
   54 entering pump outlet passage 118 opens second check valve 120 and third check valve
20 122 such that fluid 54 travels across second check valve 120 and third check valve 122
   where it exits pump 24. As piston 62 strokes downward again, the vacuum created by
   downward stroking piston 62 closes second check valve 120 and third check valve 122
   such that fluid 54 that has exited pump 24 will not be pulled back into pump 24.
             FIGS. 6A-7 will now be discussed concurrently. FIG. 6A is an enlarged cross
25 sectional view of piston first end 108 from the embodiment of FIG. 5, showing first check
   valve 114 in a closed position. FIG. 6B is another enlarged cross sectional view of piston
   first end 108 from the embodiment of FIG. 5 showing first check valve 114 in an open
   position.    FIG. 7 is an exploded perspective view of piston first end 108 from the
   embodiment of FIGS. 6A and 6B. Piston 62 includes piston first end 108, piston second
30 end 110 (shown in FIG. 4), fluid passage 112, first check valve 114, first recess 126, and
   chamfered surface 128. In the embodiments of FIGS 6A-7, first check valve 114 includes
   check ball 130 and retaining guide 132. Retaining guide 132 includes outer cylindrical
   surface 134, inner cylindrical surface 136, retaining guide first end 138 and retaining
                                                12

   guide second end 140. In the embodiments of FIGS 6A-7, first recess 126 includes
   channels 142 and ribs 144. Piston 62 pumps fluid 54.
             First recess 126 is formed in piston first end 108 and has a diameter larger than a
   diameter of fluid passage 112 yet smaller than a diameter of piston 62. First recess 126 is
 5 next to fluid passage 112 and is fluidly connected to fluid passage 112. Ribs 144 are
   formed inside first recess 126 and extend substantially the entire depth of first recess 126
   into piston first end 108. Channels          142 are disposed between ribs       144, which
   circumferentially space apart channels 142 inside first recess 126. Each channel 142 is
   disposed between two ribs 144. In the embodiment of FIGS. 6A and 6B, three channels
10 142 and two ribs 144 are visible. Check ball 130 is disposed inside first recess 126 and
   has a diameter larger than a diameter of fluid passage 112 yet small enough to allow
   check ball 130 to move up and down inside first recess 126 along ribs 144 without check
   ball 130 binding against ribs 144. Chamfered surface 128 may be disposed between fluid
   passage 112 and first recess 126 and may provide a seat for check ball 130 and aid check
15 ball 130 in closing off fluid passage 112 when first check valve 114 is in a closed
   position.
             Retaining guide 132 is shaped as an annular cylindrical pipe, with outer
   cylindrical surface 134 on the outside, inner cylindrical surface 136 on the inside, and two
   opposing ends defined by retaining guide first end 138 and retaining guide second end
20 140. When retaining guide 132 is inserted into first recess 126, outer cylindrical surface
   134 of retaining guide 132 abuts against ribs 144 in a press fit, with retaining guide first
   end 138 disposed at piston first end 108 and retaining guide second end 140 extending
   into first recess 126 towards check ball 130. Inner cylindrical surface 136 of retaining
   guide 132 is smaller in diameter than check ball 130 such that check ball 130 may not
25 pass through retaining guide 132. First recess 126 accommodates both check ball 130 and
   retaining guide 132 because the depth first recess 126 extends into piston 62 is equal to or
   deeper than the length of retaining guide 132 combined with the diameter of check ball
   130. Once installed, retaining guide 132 leaves enough space within first recess 126 that
   check ball 130 may move inside first recess 126 between open and closed positions. As
30 discussed above in the description of FIG. 5, first check valve 114 closes as piston 62
   strokes upward and first check valve 114 opens as piston 62 strokes downward. In the
   closed position, check ball 130 rests against chamfered surface 128 and blocks fluid
   passage 112 such that fluid 54 that has already crossed first check valve 114 may not
   reenter fluid passage 112. In the open position, check ball 130 is raised above chamfered
                                                  13

   surface 128 and fluid passage 112 such that fluid 54 enters first recess 126, flows into
   channels 142, flows past retaining guide 132 through channels 142, and exits piston first
   end 108. While the retaining guide 132 is described as an annular cylindrical pipe press
   fitted inside first recess 126, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that retaining
 5 guide 132 may be threaded or snap fitted into first recess 126, or that retaining guide 132
   may include a geometry that is different from an annular cylindrical pipe yet still capable
   of allowing fluid 54 to exit first recess 126 while retaining check ball 130 within first
   recess 126. Because retaining guide 132 is generally formed as a single component,
   retaining guide 132 provides an effective, inexpensive, and simple solution for retaining
10 check ball 130 inside recess 126.
             FIG. 8 is an enlarged cross sectional view of piston seal assembly 96 from the
   embodiment of pump 24 described in FIG. 4. Pump 24 includes main body 56, support
   post 58, piston housing 60, piston 62, rocker arm assembly 64, pivot joint 66, ball and
   socket joint 68, pump inlet tube 70, spring 80, and seal assembly 96. In the embodiment
15 of FIG. 8, support post 58 includes support post first end 86 (shown in FIG. 4), support
   post second end 88, and pump inlet passage 98. In the embodiment of FIG. 8, piston
   housing 60 includes piston housing first end 90 (shown in FIG. 4), piston housing second
   end 92, piston housing inlet 104 (shown in FIG. 4), and bore 102. Piston housing 60
   further includes second recess 146. In the embodiment of FIG. 8, piston 62 includes
20 piston first end 108 (shown in FIG. 4), and piston second end 110. In the embodiment of
   FIG. 8, seal assembly 96 includes first elastomeric seal 148, second elastomeric seal 150,
   spacer 152A, spacer 152B, spacer 152C and snap ring 154. First elastomeric seal 148 and
   second elastomeric seal may be U-cup seals that include fringes 156. Pump 24 is
   lubricated by fluid 54 and may pump fluid 54.
25           In FIG. 8, components of like numbering with the components of FIG. 4 are
   assembled as discussed above with reference to FIG. 4. Second recess 146 is formed in
   piston housing 60 at piston housing second end 92 and extends from piston housing
   second end 92 towards piston housing inlet 104 without reaching piston housing inlet
   104. Second recess 146 has a diameter larger than a diameter of bore 102 so as to
30 accommodate seal assembly 96 and second recess 146 is approximately concentric with
   bore 102 and piston 62. First elastomeric seal 148 and second elastomeric seal 150 are
   each disposed around piston 62 inside second recess 146. In the embodiment of FIG. 8,
   both first elastomeric seal 148 and second elastomeric seal 150 are U-cup seals. First
   elastomeric seal 148 is oriented inside second recess 146 and around piston 62 such that
                                                   14
   3447701vl

   its U-cup geometry and fringes 156 face towards piston housing first end 90. Second
   elastomeric seal 150 is oriented inside second recess 146 and around piston 62 such that
   its U-cup geometry and fringes 156 face towards piston housing second end 92. As piston
   62 actuates inside pump 24 and pumps fluid 54, pressure builds-up inside pump 24 and
 5 pushes fringes 156 of first elastomeric seal 148 and second elastomeric seal 150 against
   piston 62 and the walls of second recess 146 thereby creating a tight seal that prevents
   fluid 54 from leaking out of pump 24 along piston 62 and second recess 146 at piston
   housing second end 92. Spacer 152A and spacer 152B are disposed inside second recess
   146 between first elastomeric seal 148 and second elastomeric seal 150. Along with
10 spacing first elastomeric seal 148 from second elastomeric seal 150, spacer 152A and
   spacer 152B provide backing and support to first elastomeric seal 148 and second
   elastomeric seal 150 to ensure first elastomeric seal 148 and second elastomeric seal 150
   engage piston 62 and second recess 146 evenly. Snap ring 154 is disposed inside second
   recess 146 between piston housing second end 92 and first elastomeric seal 148 and
15 second elastomeric seal 150. Spacer 152C is disposed between snap ring 154 and first
   elastomeric seal 148 and second elastomeric seal 150. Spacer 152C prevents pinching of
   first elastomeric seal 148 by snap ring 154 and ensures that first elastomeric seal 148
   engages piston 62 and second recess 146 evenly. Snap ring 154 retains first elastomeric
   seal 148, second elastomeric seal 150, space 152A, spacer 152B, and spacer 152C inside
20 second recess 146. Because of snap ring 154 and spacers 152A, 152B, and 152C, seal
   assembly 96 is easily installed inside second 146 and is easy to replace.
             As discussed above in the description of FIG. 4, seal assembly 96 fluidly seals
   piston housing 60 and piston 62 such that pump 24 can pump fluid 54 without fluid 54
   leaking out of pump 24 between piston housing 60 and piston 62. Seal assembly 96 is
25 especially useful when pump 24 is configured as a gravity fed pump or a pressure fed
   pump. When pump 24 is a gravity fed pump or a pressure fed pump, pump 24 pumps a
   fluid other than fluid 54. This different fluid is pressure fed or gravity fed directly into
   fluid pathway 100 of pump 24 from a reservoir different from fluid reservoir 20 which
   houses fluid 54 and to which pump 24 is mounted. After this different fluid is fed into
30 fluid pathway 100 of pump 24, pump 24 pumps it away from pump 24. While pump 24 is
   pumping this different fluid, fluid 54 lubricates rocker arm assembly 64, pivot joint 66,
   and ball and socket joint 68. As pump 24 pumps this different fluid and fluid 54 lubricates

   54. Preventing the contamination of fluid 54 by the different fluid in pump 24 ensures the
   quality of fluid 54 which is selected to optimize the performance of pump 24. Meanwhile,
   pump 24 is able to deliver a different fluid that meets the requirements of the end to
   which it is delivered though pump 24 is lubricated by fluid 54 which is selected to

             FIGS. 9 and 10 will now be discussed concurrently. FIG. 9 is an enlarged cross
   sectional view of ball and socket joint 68 connecting rocker assembly 64 to piston second
   end 110 of piston 62 of pump 24 shown in FIG 4. FIG. 10 is a partial exploded view of
   the embodiment of FIG. 9. Pump 24 includes main body 56 with second surface 84,
10 support post 58, piston housing 60, piston 62, rocker arm assembly 64, pivot joint 66, ball
   and socket joint 68, adjustment screw 74, and spring 80. In the embodiment of FIG. 9,
   support post 58 includes support post second end 88, and pump inlet passage 98. In the
   embodiment of FIG. 9, piston housing 60 includes piston housing second end 92, bore
    102 (shown in FIG. 4), and second recess 146. In the embodiment of FIG. 9, piston 62
15 includes piston second end 110, rounded surface 158, and annular groove 160. In the
   embodiment of FIG. 9, rocker arm assembly 64 includes arm 162, roller 164, roller joint
    166, seat 168, and coupler 170. Arm 162 includes arm first end 172 and arm second end
    174. Seat 168 includes side plates 176 and top plate 178; top plate 178 including dimple
    180. Coupler 170 includes prongs 182, sides 184, platform 186, slot 188, and spring
20 guards 190.
             In FIGS. 9 and 10, components of like numbering with the components of FIGS. 4
   and 8 are assembled as discussed above with reference to FIGS. 4 and 8. Rounded surface
    158 of piston 62 is formed on piston second end 110, and annular groove 160 is formed
   on piston 62 between piston first end 108 and piston second end 110 on a portion of
25 piston 62 that extends outside of piston housing second end 92 after piston 62 is installed
   inside piston housing 60. Pivot joint 66 connects arm 162 of rocker arm assembly 64 to
   support post second end 88 and allows arm 162 to rotate. Arm first end 172 extends from
   pivot joint 66 towards piston 62 while arm second end 174 extends from pivot joint 66
   towards adjustment screw 74. Roller joint 166 connects roller 164 to arm first end 172
30 and allows roller 164 to spin on arm first end 172. Seat 168 has two side plates 176 that
   extend from top plate 178 of seat 168 to form a U-shaped yoke that connects to roller
   joint 166 such that roller 164 is disposed between the two side plates 176 and beneath the
   top plate of seat 168. Because seat 168 is connected to roller joint 166, seat 168 is also
   connected to arm first end 172. In the embodiment of FIG. 9, only one of the two side
                                                 16
   3447701vl

   plates 176 is shown because FIG. 9 is a cross sectional view. Dimple 180 is centered on
   top plate 178 of seat 168 and mates with rounded surface 158 of piston 62. Together,
   rounded surface 158 of piston 62 and dimple 180 of seat 168 form ball and socket joint
   68.
 5           Coupler 170 connects top plate 178 of seat 168 to piston 62 and maintains the
   joint between rounded surface 158 of piston 62 and dimple 180 of seat 168. Slot 188 is
   formed in platform 187 of coupler 170 and mates with annular groove 160 of piston 62
   such that platform 187 extends into annular groove 160 of piston 62, connecting coupler
    170 to piston 62. Coupler 170 is a C-clip with sides 184 extending down from platform
10  186 away from piston 62 and past top plate 178 of seat 168. Prongs 182 extend
   perpendicularly from sides 184 between top plate 178 and arm first end 172, thereby
   connecting coupler 170 to seat 168. Spring 80 is disposed around piston housing 60 and
   extends between second surface 84 of main body 56 and platform 186 of coupler 170.
    Spring guards 190 extend from platform 186 toward piston housing first end 90 and
15 prevent spring 80 from slipping off of platform 186.
             As described above, pump 24 is actuated by camshaft 18 with a cam 52 as shown
   in FIG. 4. Cam 52 of camshaft 18 rotates against roller 164, causing roller 164 to
   essentially travel over an arc. As cam 52 rotates against roller 164, cam 52 periodically
   pushes roller 164, arm first end 172, seat 168, piston 62, and coupler 170 towards piston
20 housing first end 90, compressing spring 80 in the process. Between the periods where
   cam 52 is pushing roller 164, arm first end 172, seat 168, piston 62, and coupler 170
   towards piston housing first end 90, spring 80 decompresses and pushes coupler 170,
   piston 62, seat 168, arm first end 172, and roller 164 away from piston housing first end
   90 and towards cam 52. As cam 52 and spring 80 move roller 164, arm first end 172, seat
25  168, piston 62, and coupler 170 back and forth, ball and socket joint 68 and coupler 170
   ensure that piston 62 remains aligned with bore 102 of piston housing 60 by preventing
   piston second end 110 from shifting laterally on seat 168.
             In a prior art pump, the piston has a flat second end which has a tendency to slip
   laterally against the rocker arm assembly actuating it. This slipping action in the prior art
30 pump places a bending moment on the second end of the piston which increases the wear
   between the piston and the piston housing, thereby reducing the tolerances between the
   piston and the piston housing, and reducing the life of the pump. Because ball and socket
   joint 68 and coupler 170 prevents piston second end 110 from slipping, piston 62 and
   piston housing 60 are able to maintain tolerances as tight as .00045 inches to .00025
                                                  17
   3447701vl

   inches. Such tight tolerances increase the efficiency of pump 24 by reducing fluid leakage
   between piston 62 and piston housing 60.
             FIG. 11 is an enlarged cross sectional view of another embodiment of ball and
   socket joint 68 connecting rocker assembly 64 to piston second end 110 of piston 62 of
 5 pump 24. In FIG. 11, components of like numbering with the components of FIGS. 4, 9,
   and 10 are assembled as discussed above with reference to FIGS. 4, 9, and 10. In the
   embodiment of FIG. 11, coupler 170 further includes clip 192, and washer 194.
             As discussed above, coupler 170 connects top plate 178 of seat 168 to piston 62
   and maintains the joint between rounded surface 158 of piston 62 and dimple 180 of seat
10 168. Slot 188 is formed in platform 187 of coupler 170 and mates with annular groove
   160 of piston 62 such that platform 187 extends into annular groove 160 of piston 62.
   Washer 194 and clip 192 are disposed around piston 62 inside annular groove 160 and
   between platform 187 and seat 168. Washer 194 and clip 192 assist in connecting piston
   62 to coupler 170 by preventing platform 187 of coupler 170 from slipping out of annular
15 groove 160 of piston 62.
             In view of the foregoing description, it will be recognized that the present
   disclosure provides numerous advantages and benefits.            For example, the present
   disclosure allows box lubricator 10 to pump a fluid different from fluid 54 used to
   lubricate pump 24 of box lubricator 10. Moreover, the present disclosure maintains
20 tolerances as tight as .00045 inches to .00025 inches between piston 62 and piston
   housing 60 by reducing the lateral movement of piston second end 110. Additionally, the
   present disclosure provides an effective, inexpensive, and simple retaining guide 132 for
   retaining check ball 130 inside recess 126 formed in piston first end 108.
