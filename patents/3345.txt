ABSTRACT
     With the increasing booming population, use of transportation vehicles and the
establishment of factories, the society is moving forward at an unprecedented rate.
These advancement and innovation have greatly improved the lives of those who live in
the 21" century, while many serious environmental and health issues emerged, one of
which is PM2.5 or also known as atmospheric particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5
micrometers. This article present an invention that relates to a method for correcting
PM 2.5 sensors based on linear regression algorithm. Based on accurate data received
from PM 2.5 monitoring station near the proximity of the PM 2.5 sensor, the method
uses linear regression algorithm to correct the PM 2.5 output value of the sensor,
making the output value of the sensor consistent with the accurate value of PM 2.5 from
the monitoring station, and therefore achieving the purpose of making the PM 2.5
sensor more accurate and reliable. This method is simple and has high precision and
strong practicability.

DESCRIPTION
Title
      A correction method based on linear regression algorithm for PM2.5 sensors
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
      This invention belongs to the field of detection equipment technology, and especially, it is
a method of correcting and adjusting PM2.5 sensors using linear regression algorithm.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
     With the spread of industrialization, one problem that we are always obsessed by is the
increment of haze. Peculiarly, in the north of China, many citizens have suffered from the
hazards brought by haze. According to the analysis of China meteorological administration, an
area of over 101 million square kilometers in the north of China, the Yellow river-huai river
valley and Changjiang-huaihe basin were covered by haze in December, 2016, and 23 cities
including Beijing and Tianjin started Red alert to this situation. What's more, nearly 50
expressways had been suspended. Fortunately, Chinese government has implemented the
regulation that PM2.5 which is the main cause of haze should be included in daily air quality
monitoring.
     This also brings another problem to the public. Mostly, due to the paucity of accurate and
precise devices, ordinary people can hardly pinpoint the amount of PM2.5 with general
detection equipment. Humidity, temperature, sunlight and many other factors can affect the
result of the detection. For these reasons, it is highly necessary to apply a method to correct
these gears to acquire a relatively precise index. One way to finish this job is using the data
collected at nearby monitoring station as true index. This patent utilizes equation of linear
regression to set a connection between the data from detection equipment and data of
monitoring station. Hence, with the help of Linear Regression, we can correct the following
data.

     Compared to other methods, Linear Regression is not only convenient but also valid.
Though it is a speculation, once we have enough data, it can foretell the index accurately as well.
Data from monitoring station is open to the public and it is convenient for everyone to acquire
huge amount of data to foresee the true index.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
     We start with pretreatment to the data of PM2.5 collected by the sensor and the real data
of PM2.5 collected by the monitoring station. We suppose that a sample of data from i -th
PM2.5 sensor. The sample is represented asxoi). For any i=1,2,...,n,x              =    0
                                                                                      x...-x.
 n is the data amount of the sample, m is the number of features and we assume that
 X0    1.
Besides, we construct a linear-regression model h (x)                ,x,   x, where       =[601...6 .
                                                                i=O
  i is the parameter of i -th feature, xi is the value of i -th feature and h (x) is the value
predicted by the linear-regression algorithm. We also construct a cost function that is
J(   ) i     (h (x(')) y(i))
                              2
                                 . The aim of the cost function is to minimize the value of J( )and
then find the value of      .   y( is the value of the real data of the i -th sample.
By gradient descent, we get a function             i=               where     is the step size. From
this function, we can calculate          (h                            (xA) y". We can get the
                                           j       =1

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
      The invention patent of the haze sensor was placed in Wanliu, Beijing. Its sampling
period is 15 seconds and the original data is shown in Fig. 1. Real haze data is collected from
Wanliu, Beijing. Wanliu monitoring station and is shown in Fig. 2. Concrete implementation
steps are as follows:
Step1: The data pre-processing stage, as shown in Fig. 3, can be divided into three steps. In
step 1.1 and 1.2, we process the PM2.5 sensor data and Wanliu station data, and then in step
1.3 we integrate the processed data. Specific steps are as follows:
                                                    3

      Step 1.1 This step is called the PM2.5 sensor data processing. The sensor data is shown in
Fig. 1. It processes the data of October 20 to 31 collected by the sensor and gets the hourly
haze average value of October 20 to October 31. Specific steps are as follows:
      Define function ReadData(month, day, min, max), in which month, day, min and max
represent the month, day, hour upper limit and hour lower limit when the data was collected.
      Set the sum of PM25 PM25_sum=0,counter num=0
      Open       the    original   sensor   data    m3_y201710.txt      which     is  stored     in
Data/OriginalSampleData, the data form is shown in figure 1.
      Store the original data in different files according to its months and dates. For every line
of the original data, open or cerate the corresponding files under the catalog /Data/PM25 in a
form of monthday.
      In order to figure out the everyday hourly haze value and store the data in the
corresponding file month day, we split every line in the data according to the space character,
take the second term and get the string of year/month/date. Then we split the string according
to the '/', take the third term and use int function to get value of the data. Judging the data, if
the date value equals to the value of day and the value of hours is greater than or equal to min,
less than max, gets into the next step. If the value of the data is not 0, add the value to
PM25_sum, add 1 to num. If the data is not within the set range, there are two situations. In
the first case, num is not equal to 0, it shows that the data has been processed. Work out the
average value of PM25 PM25_sum/num and write it into the file monthday. Break the loop.
In the second case, num is equal to 0, it shows that the data of this period is missing or no
eligible data has been read. Continue the loop. The code is shown below.
def ReadData(month, day, min, max):
     PM25_sum= 0
     num   = 0
     Originaldata = open("../Data/OriginalSampleData/m3   y201710.txt")
     for line in Original data:
                                                  4

           NewFile = open("../Data/PM25/"+str(month)+'_'+str(day),'a')
           if (int(line.splito[1].split('/')[2]) == day and min <= int(line.splito[2].split(':')[0]) < max):
                 if (float(line.splito[0]) != 0):
                       num += 1
                       PM25_sum += float(line.splito [0])
                       print(num)
           else:
                 if(num != 0):
                       PM25 = PM25_sum / num
                       New File.write(str(max) + '\t' + str(PM25) +'\n')
                       break
                       #num = 0
                 else:
                       continue
Step 1.2 This step is called the Wanliu station data processing. The data in Wanliu station
refers to the inaccurate data. The data is stored in csv files. From Fig2 we have noticed that
there are several lines about PM1O or AQI, and there is also information in the areas other
than Wanliu.
       Therefore, the main task of Step 1.2 is to collect the information of only PM2.5 from Oct
2 1 " to Oct 3 1", which is called, screening. Specific steps are as follows.
       We defined a function called Wanliupm25, the parameters of which are month, dmin and
dmax. Dmin and dmax refer to the earliest and the latest date, and are not included in the date
in which we want to collect the data. In our case, we use Wanliupm25(10,20,32), meaning we
want to operate the files from Oct 21st to Oct 31".
       According to the date we have set, the appropriate csv files are opened one by one in a
loop. The first line of the csv file is the header, including the name of the locations. By using
the function of islice in the itertools library, we have cut the header of the charts, making the
loop start from the second line of the chart.
       We have created another loop which scans all the lines in the file. Using the split
function, we are able to ignore the comma character, and collect the rest elements in the line
as a list called mm.
       The third column of the file is the type of pollution, and the tenth column stores the
                                                           5

information in Wanliu area. If mm[2], the third element of a certain line, equals to "PM2.5"
and mm[9], the tenth element of the line, is not empty, it means we have found the target
information. We write mm[9] and mm[1], the time of the day, into a newly created file
according to the date. Therefore, there will be 11 files, referring to thel 1 different dates.
The code is shown below.
from itertools import islice
def Wanliupm25(month,dmin,dmax):
     for j in range(dmin,dmax):
           original file = open(r'Data\Wanliu\beijing_all_201710' + str(j) + '.csv','r',encoding='UTF-8')
           f = open('Data/WanliuPM25/'+str(month)+'_'+str(j),'a')
           for line in islice(originalfile,1,None):
                 mm = line.split(',')
                 for i in range(25):
                       if(int(mm[1]) == i and mm[2] == 'PM2.5' and mm[9]
                             f.write(mm[ 1]+'\t'+mm[9]+'\n')
if name ==' main__
Wanliupm25(10,20,32)
Step 1.3 This step is called the combination of the data. Through step 1.1 and step 1.2, we
have got 11 files of original data and 11 files of Wanliu station data. The files are divided
according to the date. However, when operating the data, the input information is made up of
two files: the training set and the testing set. The main task of this step is to create a
combination of the two groups of the data.
      We collected the original and station data from Oct 21" to Oct                3 0 th as the training set,
and the data from the date of Oct 31" serve as the testing set. There are two newly created
files called "com" and "test" to respectively store the training data and the testing data, by
using alternative statement.
      In the loop which scans the whole 11 days, for each day, we open the appropriate files in
original and Wanliu folder. We set two empty list called t and m, to store the information of
the two files. During the process, we use the split function to ignore the space character and
make the rest elements a list. We use the function of append to add new element, in this case,
the time and the numerical value of the PM2.5, into a list.
                                                         6

       After storing the list t and m, we create a nested loop which scans both the elements in
list t and those in list m. The parameter i and j respectively range from the number of lines in
list t and list m. When m[j].split('\t')[0], the time in original data, equals to t[i].split('\t')[0], the
time in Wanliu data, we write them into the appropriate file. According to the date, we choose
to write them in the training set, or the testing set.
       The form of a signal line when we write information into the file is: the number "1"
followed by the number in Wanliu data, then the original data. The three numbers are divided
by space. It is shown in Fig.4.
The code is shown below.
f_corn = open(r'Data\COMData\com','a')
f test = open(r'Data\COMData\test','a')
for filename in range(20,32):
      if filename != 31:
             sampledata = open(r'Data\PM25\PM2510_'+str(filename))
            wanliudata = open(r'Data\WanliuPM25\l0_'+str(filename))
            t=   []
            m=[]
             for sampleline in sampledata:
                    sample = sampleline.split('\t')
                    t.append(samplem[O]+'\t'+samplem[ 1])
             for wanliuline in wanliudata:
                    wanliu m = wanliuline.split('\t')
                    m.append(wanlium[O]+'\t'+wanlium[ 1])
             for i in range(len(t)):
                    for j in range(len(m)):
                          if(m[j].split('\t')[0] == t[i].split('\t')[0]):
                                f_com.write('1'+'\t'+t[i].split('\t')[1].strip('\n')+'\t'+m[i].split('\t')[1])
      else:
             sampledata = open(r' \Data\PM25\PM2510_'+str(filename))
            wanliudata = open(r'Data\WanliuPM25\l0 '+str(filename))
            t = []
            m=[]
             for sampleline in sampledata:
                    sample = sampleline.split('\t')
                    t.append(samplem[O]+'\t'+samplem[ 1])
             for wanliuline in wanliudata:
                    wanliu m = wanliuline.split('\t')
                    m.append(wanlium[O]+'\t'+wanliu_m[ 1])
             for i in range(len(t)):
                    for j in range(len(m)):
                          if (m[j].split('\t')[0] == t[i].split('\t')[0]):
                                f test.write('l' + '\t' + t[i].split('\t')[1].strip('\n')+'\t'+ m[i].split('\t')[1])
Step 2       Use preceding gradient descent method to figure out parameters of linear regression
model. Specific steps are as follows:
                                                                   7

Step 2.1 Read the data, define function loadDataSet(fileName):
      Split the first line of the file with '\t', get the number of the elements. Set numFeat as the
number of the elements minus 1 to get the number of fields.
      Set three empty matrix dataMat, labe/Mat and lineArr. Split every single line with '\t' ,
CurLine are the elements of every single line. Append every line's first to No.numFeat-1
element's value to lineArr. Then append lineArr to dataMat. Datamat contains the haze data
collected from the haze sensor.
      Append the value of the last element of each line float(curLine[-1])to labe/Mat then we
get a matrix which contains the haze data form wanliu haze monitoring station. The code is
shown below:
def loadDataSet(fileName):            #general function to parse tab -delimited floats
     numFeat = len(open(fileName).readlineo.split('\t')) - 1 #get number of fields
     print(numFeat)
     dataMat = []; labelMat = []
     fr = open(fileName)
     for line in fr.readlineso:
           lineArr =[]
           curLine = line.stripo.split('\t')
           for i in range(numFeat):
                 lineArr.append(float(curLine[i]))
           dataMat.append(lineArr)
           labelMat.append(float(curLine[-1]))
     return dataMat,labelMat
Step2.2 Use gradient descent method to solve the model parameters, as is shown in figure 5.
Define the gradient descent function gradAscent(dataMatIn,classLabels):
      DataMatIn and classLabels are the dataMat and labe/Mat which is obtained from the
loadDataSet(fileName)respectively.
      Set DataMatrix and labe/Mat as dataMatIn matrix and the transpose of classLabels
respectively. Create n X 1 all 1 matrix weights, n is the number of columns in the dataMatrix.
      Execute the loop for MaxCycles times:
      Calculate the predicted value of haze h=linearFunc(dataMatrix,               weights)=dataMatrixX
weights. Calculate the error error=labelMat-h. Update the parameter weights=weights+alpha
                                                        8

 XdataMatrix Xerror, in which, alpha is the learning rate. The code is shown below:
def gradAscent(dataMatln, classLabels):
     dataMatrix = mat(dataMatln)
     labelMat = mat(classLabels).transpose()
     m, n = shape(dataMatrix)
     weights = ones((n, 1))
     print(weights)
     print(shape(dataMatrix))
     for k in range(maxCycles):
           h = linearFunc(dataMatrix, weights)
           error = (labelMat - h)
           weights = weights + alpha * dataMatrix.transpose() * error
     return weights
Step3 For a new set of sensor data, firstly we use Step 1.1 to process the data, then we can call
our linear regression model and easily get the corrected value of this measuring value. That is
to say the haze sensor is corrected. Step 3 can be shown in Fig. 6.
