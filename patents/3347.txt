   DOOR PANEL AND A                 STILE THEREOF
   The       present           invention          relates         to    a     customizable                door
   panel       and      a    stile     thereof         for     example         particularly,               but
 5 not        exclusively,              a    door         panel        with        stile          that      is
   customizable in shape and size.
   BACKGROUND OF THE                  INVENTION
10 Wooden         doors       are beautiful             and      sturdy but           it     falters        in
   comparison            to     metal     or plastic           door      in    its     necessity           for
   upkeep.          Overtime,         wood       is    prone      to    warping          and      rotting.
   The expenses               for    maintenance            add to      the      overall          costs     in
   having a wooden door.
15
   Owing        to     the       many    benefits          with      uPVC       doors,        they        have
   become          the      preferred         option          for    houses          and      commercial
   buildings.               They     are      proven          to     be     good        solution           for
   affordable              and     durable        doors.       However         one      of    the       major
20 drawbacks            of      uPVC     doors        is    the      issue        of     strength          and
   security.            They       are    not     as    durable        and      robust         as     wooden
   doors.          Also,        the    shape         and     size      is     pre-determined                at
   manufacture and alteration is not intended.
25 The      invention           seeks     to    eliminate          or at       least       to     mitigate
   such shortcomings                  for    more       strength         and      security          without
   a     substantial              increase        in    costs       by     providing            a    new    or
   otherwise improved customizable door panel and stile.

 5 elongated            ribs         105     that          runs      along        whole         length       of    the
   interior.            The       ribs        105       define         a    plurality              of     elongated
   spaces        in     the       form of channels                      107 that            run parallel             to
   one       another           along         the        entire          length         of       the       interior.
   These         ribs           provide              foundation               for         installing             door

   Relative          positions              between            the     stiles         101       and      the    skins
   103        and       104        are        fixed          by      way        of       engagement             means
   106/103A/104A. The engagement means 106/103A/104A include
15 male        and       female          engagement                members          106/103A/104A.                 The
   male       engagement              member          is      in    the      form       of     a    hook     103A       /
   104A       extending              from      one         end      of   the      respective               skin     103
   and       104.     The       female         engagement              member         is     in      the    form of
   grooves          106      provided            on       respective            front        and       rear     sides

   Referring            to     Figure          3,      the        groove        106      is     slanted.         More
   specifically                the      parallel              side      walls        of      the      groove        106
   are slanted             at     an angle of about                      50-100 with respect to                      an

   door       panel         100       presses            against          an     upper         corner        of    the
   hook       103A       or     104A       in      a     fluid       tight        manner          to     produce       a
   perfect          finishing              and        prevent           liquid          from        entering         or
30 exiting         there         through.             Gap       is    created          between           the    walls
   of     the     groove            106      and       rest         of    the     hook         103A       or    104A.
   Adhesive          is      retained            in     the       gap     and     those         in     excess      are
   forced into any space between the skin 103 or 104 and the
   stile        101.       The tight              fitting           between         the       side wall          106A
35 of the groove 106 and the corner of the hook 103A or 104A
   prevents          any excess               adhesive             from leaving               the groove            106
   there       through.            This       contributes               to     the overall               clean     and

   and     4B.     By    cutting          through         the      ribs       105,      an     aperture         is
   created         for     installing            the mortise.                The    connection            plate
   of      a     door       hinge          can      be       screwed           directly             onto      the
   varnished             portion             102      and          adjacent            ribs          105       for
10 anchorage.
   Referring             to       Figure          5,      there          is      shown           a     further
   embodiment           of the          invention.           To adjust            the      overall        width
   of    the      door      panel         100,     the      stile        101     together            with     the
15 skin      103      and     104      are     trimmed          resulting            in     a    raw     opened
   end. The opened end is closed by a                                    further separate stile
   300.         The      stile           300      is       a      T-shaped             separate           piece
   attachable to the trimmed stile 101 by way of adhesive. A
   stem       302      protrudes            from     an      underside           301       of      the    stile
20 300. As shown in Figure 5, the stile 300 is sandwiched by
   two      undersides              301      that       tapers          towards           the       stem      302
   forming an angle of about                         400 with a            side wall of the stem
   302.      An     outer       portion          of    each        of    the      slanted           underside
   presses         onto       the      free      end     of      the     respective              skins      103A
25 and      104A       to     form        a   fluid        tight         engagement.               A   gap      is
   formed between                rest       of the       slanted          surface          and the        stile
   101      for       accommodating               excessive             adhesive            therein.          The
   fluid         tight        engagement             prevent            adhesive            from       passing
   therethrough              to      maintain          the        overall         clean         and      smooth
30 finishing of the door panel 100.
   Noteworthy,              a      void       105A       is       formed         in       the       varnished
   portion         102 of the stile                  101 which            is    useful         to    mitigate
   any     distortion             resulting          in     uneven         cooling          of     the    stile
35 101.       It     also       decreases           the      thickness            of      the       varnished
   portion          102      without          affecting             the       external            appearance
   thereof         to     permit          more     even        cooling          of     the      member         101

   after extrusion.
   Referring       to Figure       6,   top rail       and bottom rail              400 are
   assembled       to the door panel            100    after     the stile          101/300
 5 and the skin are in place. The rail 400 includes two sets
   of protrusions         400A and 400B.          A first       set    of protrusions
   400A    are       provided      adjacent        the       left    and       right      end
   portions       of the     rail     400 dimensioned           for    insertion        into
   the  channels        107     defined by       the     ribs     105    in     the   stile
10 101.   A    second      set    of    protrusion          400B    is    preferably          a
   single     piece     structure        extending       into     the      interior       109
   defined by the          left     and right       stiles       101    and the       front
   and  rear skins         103    and    104.   The     rail     400    is     secured      in
   position       by   way    of adhesive        applied       on the         protrusions
15 400A and/or 400B. Each of the protrusions 400A is conical
   in  shape       without      a  pointed      end.      It   tapers        towards      its
   free end for easy insertion which                       is  guided by the ribs
   105 defining the channel 107. Once the stile 101/300, the
   skins 103 and 104 and the rails 400 are in place, filling
20 material      is   injected to fill          the interior           109.      The cured
   foam secures the skins 103 and 104, the stile 101 as well
   as the rails 400 together.
   The invention has been given by way of example only,                                   and
25 various     other modifications             of and/or alterations to the
   described        embodiment       may be     made      by   persons         skilled      in
   the art without departing from the scope of the invention
   as specified in the appended claims.
