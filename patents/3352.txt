       The   present     disclosure        relates       to a   method    for     removing
carbon    dioxide      from     hydrocarbons,          the  method     comprising        the
steps   of:   (a) contacting a feed stream comprising hydrocarbons

                                         Technical Field
         The    present       invention         relates         to     a    method       and     a    system
for removing carbon dioxide from a hydrocarbon                                      stream.
                                             Background
         Natural      gas     is    an     important         source        of   light       hydrocarbon
fuel       comprising         predominantly              methane,          and     is     increasingly
used        in    place        of     conventional              fuels         due      to       its      wide
availability           and       relative        ease        of      extraction           compared           to
conventional          fuels      refined from crude oil.                        However, a           lot     of
natural        gas   reservoirs           contain        a   substantially              high      fraction
of    impurities,         such      as    carbon      dioxide         (C02)   .   Some      natural        gas
reservoirs         may     contain         C02   content          of     higher       than       30%,      for
instance        50%   to    60%,     and up to          70%-90%.            Other      impurities may
include       compounds        such as hydrogen               sulfide        (H 2 S),    nitrogen          (N2 )
and      carbon     monoxide           (CO).      In     most       reservoirs           however,           C02
usually forms           the main         impurity component of                   the extracted raw
natural gas. Hence, there is                      a need to process the raw natural
gas to remove          the C02 before            the natural             gas can be efficiently
employed        for    energy        generation.              Therefore,           there       have      been
numerous        methods      proposed        in    the     art     to     remove      C02    from a        raw
hydrocarbon         stream such as natural gas.
One known method relates to a gas separation method wherein
the raw natural gas is                  caused to flow through a membrane. As
the different gaseous components                          in the natural gas will
permeate the membrane at rates distinct from the permeation
rate of methane, the raw natural gas

                                                    2
   stream     becomes          separated        into a         methane-rich           stream     and
   an impurity-rich              stream.        However,           one   drawback of such a
   method       is      that        the    primary           driving         force       for     the
   separation        is      the difference             in    partial       pressure         of  the
 5 permeating         component          in      the       permeate         stream        and    the
   retentate stream.                 As such, the efficiency of separation
   decreases with time as lesser impurities remain entrained
   in the natural gas stream.                        Furthermore, as some methane
   is   expected         to permeate          through          the    membrane        along     with
10 the     impurities,             there     can       be       significant           losses       in
   methane      yield of          up to 20%.          Yet      another       drawback        of  the
   gas    separation           technique        is    that        impurities        such     as   CO 2
   are separated in gaseous form. Since acidic gases such as
   CO 2   and      H2 S       cannot       be      discharged            directly          to    the
15 environment,              there      is       a     need         to     provide          storage
   facilities           for       the     C0 2 ,      which         usually         requires         a
   compression         step       to convert          the     gaseous       CO 2 to      a   highly
   pressurized          state       for   optimal          storage.        This      compression
   step     is    energy         intensive          and      results         in    high      energy
20 consumption and costs.
          Another            known       method            for       removing          CO 2     from
   hydrocarbons           is    gas   scrubbing          wherein        the    natural       gas   is
   contacted        with          a    suitable           absorbent           medium         in    an
   absorption            column,         such         as       a      packed-bed            column.
25 Typically,         amine         absorbents            such        as    monoethanolamine
   (MEA),     diethanolamine              (DEA)       methyldiethanolamine                  (MDEA),
   diisoproylamine               (DIPA)      are       used        because        they      readily
   absorb      acidic         gases     such       as     C0 2  .   However,        one     of   the
   drawbacks        of       gas     scrubbing           is       that    it      requires       the
30 procurement           of      expensive          amine          absorbents         and     which
   require       constant           regeneration             by      stripping        with      high
   temperature gases               (e.g. steam) to regenerate a lean-amine
   stream that is recycled back to the absorption column for
   further      scrubbing.             The     regeneration             process       inevitably

                                                    3
     results     in     some      amine        loss        and       there      is      a   need        to
    periodically         top up        the      amine        absorbent.              Furthermore,
     absorption      columns        are known to experience                        problems         such
     as  flooding,        foaming        and     entrainment              and     are     costly        to
  5  install and maintain.
           Therefore, there is a need to provide a method and a
     system   for    removing         C02     from hydrocarbons                 that      overcomes
    or    at   least        ameliorates             the       disadvantages               disclosed
    above.     In    particular,           there        is   need to provide                a method
 10 or   system      for     producing           a     product          natural         gas     stream
    having    no   more       than     10%,       preferably             less     than     5%,      more
    preferably        less       than      3%     carbon         dioxide,           from      a     feed
    stream     containing            high       concentrations                 of      C02,       which
    overcomes       or      ameliorates              the        disadvantages               provided
15  above.
                                              Summary
           In   one      aspect,          there         is    provided           a     method         for
    removing      carbon         dioxide        from        hydrocarbons,              the     method
20  comprising       the     steps       of:       (a)      contacting          a     feed      stream
    comprising       hydrocarbons             and      carbon         dioxide        with     one       or
    more   gas-separation             membranes            to    produce        a    hydrocarbon
    rich retentate          gas stream           and a       permeate gas             stream        rich
    in   carbon     dioxide,         the      retentate            gas     stream        containing
25  less   carbon dioxide            relative          to the         feed stream;           and       (b)
    passing    at    least       one    of the         retentate           gas    stream       or     the
    permeate gas stream through an absorption unit to produce
    a hydrocarbon-rich             gas phase and a                 liquid     absorbent phase
    containing said carbon dioxide.
30         The feed stream may contain a majority amount of                                            C02
    relative      to    hydrocarbons.               In     one       embodiment,           the      feed
    stream may contain up                 to    95%      C02.     In    another        embodiment,
    the feed stream may contain at least about 80%                                     C02.

                                                        4
            The       hydrocarbons             in     the      feed         stream        may       contain
   light        Cl-C   4   hydrocarbons,                with        a      majority          amount       of
   methane          (CH4)     relative           to    other         light        hydrocarbons.           In
   one     embodiment,            the     feed       stream          may       contain         about     30%
 5 hydrocarbons,            of which about                29%     is    CH 4 and the remaining
   1% is      C 2 -C 4   hydrocarbons.
            Advantageously,               in      the      disclosed             method,         at    least
   one       of      the      effluent            permeate            or       retentate            streams
   separated           out   by the gas-separation membranes                                 is     further
10 passed           into       an       absorption                unit,            increasing            the
   effectiveness             of    CO 2   removal           from       the      natural        gas     while
   maintaining overall yield of CH 4 .
             In     one     embodiment             of      the       disclosed            method,        the
   permeate          gas     stream,         which        is     rich        in     CO 2   and       low  in
15 pressure          and CH 4 content,              is     brought          into      contact         with a
   liquid absorbent.                  The permeate gas stream and the liquid
   absorbent           may    be     separated            by    a      permeable          membrane        to
   prevent direct mixing of the two phases.                                       The CO 2 entrained
   within the            permeate       gas       stream may be                 absorbed          into   the
20 liquid        absorbent         and      is     removed          from        the    permeate         gas,
   resulting           in   the_ formation               of    a     low      pressure,           methane
   rich       gas       phase.          Advantageously,                    this       low       pressure,
   methane-rich            gas phase           may be         employed as              a   utility       gas
   and      can       be    used       to      generate           energy           on-site.             More
25 advantageously,- this-                absorption step is                      able to -recover a
   substantial            amount       of     CH 4    that      co-permeated               through       the
   gas     separation           membrane           along       with         the      CO 2   during       the
   upstream          separation         step,        thereby          increasing           the      overall
   yield of CH 4 in            the product             stream.
30          In       an    alternative              embodiment                of      the       disclosed
   method,          the    high       pressure,             methane-rich               retentate         gas
   stream        is    brought       into       contact        with the            liquid absorbent
   instead          of     the      C0 2 -rich         permeate              gas      stream.            One
   advantage of doing so is that it would allow the membrane

                                                   5
     separation        step to be operated in                    a manner          such    that   CH 4
     loss        due     to       permeation            is        minimized.             In     this
     configuration,          while     the    retentate            gas     obtained       from the
    gas    separation        step     would      contain          significant quantities
  5 of     C0 2 ,   the    entrained        CO 2     can      be      effectively           removed
    during the         subsequent absorption step.                          For     instance, in
    one embodiment, the first membrane separation step may be
    a    single-stage         membrane       separation,             where        although      less
    CO 2    is     removed       from    the       feed       natural          gas,      there     is
10  advantageously reduced hydrocarbon loss due to its single
    stage configuration.                This improves the overall CH 4 yield.
    Furthermore,           as     the    effectiveness                 of     gas       separation
    decreases        with the        concentration            of    CO   2  remaining        in  the
    natural        gas   feed,      having      a    single         stage       gas     separation
15  step       also    serves       to   optimize            CO 2    removal         as   the    gas
    separation unit can be designed to be smaller                                     (minimizing
    unit footprint) and utilize less energy                                (cost savings).
             In   another      aspect,       there        is     provided         a    system    for
    removing        carbon      dioxide       from       hydrocarbons,              said     system
20  comprising:           (a)      one    or       more         gas        separation          units
    configured           to       receive         a      feed          stream           comprising
    hydrocarbons            and      carbon         dioxide,             wherein         the     gas
    separation         unit    is    configured          to produce             a   hydrocarbon
    rich retentate           gas    stream and a permeate                     gas stream rich
25  in    carbon dioxide;            and   (b)     one      or more         absorption         units
    located        downstream         of   said       gas       separation            units,     the
    absorption         units      configured         to     receive         at    least     one    of
    the retentate          gas stream or the permeate                         gas    stream,     and
    wherein       the   absorption units              are configured               to produce a
30  hydrocarbon-rich            gas    phase      and      a    liquid        absorbent        phase
    containing carbon dioxide.
            The feed stream may comprise a majority amount of CO
                                                                                                      2
    relative to the hydrocarbons. In one embodiment,                                      the feed
    stream may contain up to 95% CO 2 relative                               to hydrocarbons.

                                                      6
             The      hydrocarbons           in     the    feed      stream         may     contain
   light        C 1 -C 4    hydrocarbons,             with     a    majority           amount      of
   methane         (CH 4 ) relative        to other light           hydrocarbons.
            Advantageously,              the disclosed system couples                       the gas
 5 separation            unit    with      a   membrane        contactor           unit     located
   downstream,            which     greatly       increases        the overall            yield of
   CH 4    and     enhances         the    effectiveness           of     CO 2    removal.         In
   another advantageous aspect of the present invention, the
   disclosed             system       provides           flexibility           in      design      by
10 configuring             the    membrane         contactor        unit       to     receive      at
   least       one       of    the     permeate          effluent        or     the     retentate
   effluent          exiting        the    gas     separation         unit.       As    discussed
   with        reference           to      the      abovementioned               method,         this
   flexibility             allows      the    design       of    the     gas     separation        to
15 assume       either        single-stage           or   multi-stage          configurations
   to     balance          an   operator' s          needs       for     minimizing            system
   footprint,             optimal       CO 2    removal       and     while        concurrently
   maximizing CH 4 yield.

10                    Detailed Description of Drawings
         Referring          to     Fig.      1,    there      is     shown       an   exemplary
   embodiment       of     the      disclosed          system      10    in      a   simplified
   process flow diagram.
         Raw natural gas                feed 12 comprising methane                     gas    (CH 4 )
15 and   a   majority            concentration             (up     to     95%)       of    carbon
   dioxide     (C0 2 )    is     first       routed       from      a   natural        gas     pre
   treatment       unit        or     directly         from      the    raw        natural       gas
   source    and       transmitted              at     high      pressures           towards        a
   membrane     separator           unit     14.     The    raw    natural gas           feed     12
20 may  be   transmitted             at    a    pressure       ranging       from about           20
   bars to about 70 bars.
         Membrane         separator           unit      14    comprises          one     or    more
   sheets   of     separation             membrane        46     arranged         in   a   spiral
   wound    configuration                or     a    plurality          of     hollow        fiber
25 membranes      arranged           in    a    bundle      configuration.             The     high
   pressure,       natural          gas      feed      12    is    passed          through       the
   "shell"    side       of     the     separation         membrane        46.        As   CO 2   is
   more permeable          to the membrane 46 relative                       to CH 4 ,     a   high
   pressure,      retentate            stream       28    forms      within        the    "shell"
30 side and which becomes                  concentrated with              CH 4 .    Conversely,
   the  "lumen"        side      of     the     membrane        forms     a   low     pressure,
   permeate     stream         32    which       becomes       concentrated           with      CO 2.
   The permeate stream 32 typically is at lower pressures of

                                                     9
    from about            1 bar    to   about       30    bars.          At    this       stage,         the
   retentate           stream     28   exiting         the      membrane          separator            unit
    14    contains less CO 2 relative                    to the raw natural                     gas    feed
    12, and typically in the range of about 20%                                     to 40%.
 5          The      low     pressure,         permeate           stream        32      exiting          the
   membrane           separator        unit       14      may       be     passed          through            a
   compressor            34   to be re-pressurized                  for optimized                 storage
   in a storage unit 38.                    Alternatively, the permeate stream
   32       may        be      passed         to      post-processing                    units           for
10 sequestration of the CO 2 .
            The         high      pressure,             retentate              stream             28       is
   subsequently passed towards a membrane contactor unit 16.
   Membrane           contactor         unit        16      comprises             at       least        one
   membrane          44      disposed       within         the        contactor            and       which
15 partitions           ,the membrane          contactor           unit     to      form       at    least
   one     gas    flow region and at                least        one    liquid         flow       region.
   More       than       one   membrane         44    can      be      provided          within          the
   membrane         contactor        unit      16,     for     example,          a    plurality            of
   membranes          44     can   be    provided          in     a    hollow         fiber        bundle
20 configuration.
            Membrane         contactor        unit      16    is    configured            to receive
   an     incoming         liquid     absorbent           stream        22    into        its      liquid
   flow region.               Liquid      absorbent          stream        22    is     selected           to
   be any       liquid        medium     that      exhibits          preferential              affinity
25 towards         CO 2     and    which       does       not       wet      the       membrane            44
   readily.         In     one   embodiment,            the      liquid       absorbent             22     is
   sea      water.         However,       other       liquid          absorbents              are     also
   contemplated             within     the      scope       of     the     disclosed              system,
   including          amine      absorbents          such       as    MEA,      MDEA,         and     DEA.
30 However,          sea     water     is     presently            preferred            due       to    its
   availability             and   negligible           costs.        The     liquid          absorbent
   stream 22          is routed to the membrane contactor unit 16 via
   a pump system 18.

                                                   10
            Membrane contactor unit                    16    is    further configured               to
   receive the retentate stream 28 into its gas flow region.
   In this embodiment, the gas flow and the liquid absorbent
   flow are arranged countercurrent to each other but cross
 5 flow      and    co-current         flow      configurations               are    also    within
   the      scope       of     the    disclosed           system           10.     Typically,         a
   hydrophobic,             microporous           membrane,              such       as    but     not
   limited        to,      polypropylene             (PP),        polytetrafluroethylene
    (PTFE),         polyvinylidene               fluoride            (PVDF),          polysulfone
10  (PSf),      polyethylenimine              (PEI)      membranes,            is    selected       to
   form      the     permeable        barrier         between          the     gas     and   liquid
   flow regions.            The    pore     size     of     the membrane             may be     in    a
   range from 0.01 pm to about                       4   pm.     In     one embodiment,            the
   pore size of the membrane is selected such that it can be
15 readily       filled        up   by    CO 2    molecules           to    maximize       surface
   area     for absorption            of    CO 2   into the          liquid        absorbent      22.
   The CO 2 entrained within the retentate                              stream 28 dissolves
   into     the adjacent           liquid absorbent                stream       22,    forming      an
   effluent        liquid stream            24    containing            high concentrations
20 of CO 2 . The effluent              liquid       stream 24 exits                the contactor
   unit       16    and       is   passed        to     a     treatment            unit    26      for
   treatment /          processing.
            The     effluent        gas     stream        42     exiting          the    contactor
   unit     16   is     a   high pressure           gas     rich       in    CH 4   and contains
25 little       or    negligible         amounts        of    CO 2 .     In   one     embodiment,
   the      effluent          gas    stream        42     contains           less       than    10%,
   preferably          less     than    5%,    even more preferably,                     less than
   3%     C02.   The      CO 2 concentration            in     the     effluent        gas   stream
   42      may     be      suitably        varied          to     meet        the      sales      gas
30 specification.
              One     advantage         of     this       configuration               is   that       a
   single-stage membrane separation can be used for membrane
   separator          unit      14.    This       minimizes           overall        hydrocarbon

                                                       11
     loss as it         is    expected that at least                 a portion of CH 4 will
     also      permeate         through        membrane        46   to      form       part     of     the
     permeate stream               (although at a            slower     rate       than C0 2 .)         By
     having       a   single-stage             membrane        separation           unit,      the     CH 4
  5  loss can be minimized with a                         trade-off       that some           CO 2 will
     remain         entrained            within          the     retentate              stream         28.
    Advantageously,                by coupling           the membrane            separation         unit
     with a contactor unit 16 downstream,                            the entrained CO 2 can
     still      be    effectively           removed such          that        the     effluent        gas
 10  stream          42       attains           a      desired         CO  2       concentration.
     Furthermore,             as      the     retentate         stream         28      has     already
    undergone         a first-pass             separation,        the     absorption load of
     the membrane contactor unit 16 is advantageously reduced.
    Finally, by utilizing sea water as                             the       liquid       absorbent,
15  the      disclosed         system       10    is    highly     cost-effective               due     to
    the       availability             of     sea     water      and      further          does       not
    require           installation              of       separate         amine-regeneration
    units.       In another embodiment, the liquid absorbent may be
    distilled          water.         In  yet      another       embodiment,             the     liquid
20  absorbent may be water containing additives that serve to
    improve CO 2 absorption.
              Now      referring           to      Fig.       2,    there           is     shown        an
    alternative             embodiment           of     a   system       50      for      processing
    natural        gas     according          to    the    present       invention.           In    this
25  embodiment,           a    high pressure,             raw natural            gas     feed     52    is
    passed       through         a    membrane        separation        unit         54   to    form      a
    CH 4 -rich       retentate           stream         56    and    a     C0 2 -rich        permeate
    stream       58.        In    this     embodiment,          the    membrane           separation
    unit      54    may     comprise        a   plurality        of    membrane          modules        84
30  and     is    suitably          configured          for multi-stage               membrane        gas
    separation.              For       instance,           the    membrane             modules          84
    disposed         within        the    membrane          separation          unit      54   may      be
    arranged          in      a     cascaded         configuration              such       that       the
    natural gas           feed      52 has to undergo two or more                          stages of

                                                 12
   gas separation.             It would be apparent                  that the number                of
   cascades     and     stages       can      be    suitably        selected         such       that
   the     retentate           stream           56     contains             an      acceptable
   concentration          of       CO 2      to    meet      sales         or      consumption
 5 requirements.        In     one      embodiment,        the       number of         membrane
   modules     84    is     selected           such    that      retentate           stream         56
   contains      less    than       or     equal     to   about        10%     of    CO 2.        The
   retentate stream 56 may be pressurized by passing through
   a compressor 62 and sold directly                       as sales          gas 64.
10        Due      to      the        multi-stage             separation              performed
   upstream,      a significant             fraction      (up to      15%)     of the CH 4 in
   the    natural      gas      feed       52    may    be    lost       to    the     permeate
   stream     58.      As    a    result,        the    permeate          stream       58     still
   contains        a     significant               quantity           of       the        product
15 hydrocarbon         CH 4 .    Accordingly,            permeate            stream         58      is
   thereafter sent to an membrane-contactor unit 86, whereby
   it  is    configured         to    flow      counter-current              to an adjacent
   liquid     absorbent          stream         72    separated           by     a    permeable
   membrane 82.        Other flow configurations                      such as cross-flow
20 or   co-current         flow      are       also    utilized          in    the     membrane
   contactor      unit     86.      The     permeable       membrane          82    partitions
   the membrane        contactor          unit     86 to define            a region of gas
   flow and a region of liquid flow.                         It     is to be understood
   that more than one membrane 82 may be provided within the
25 absorption       unit     86.     The      membranes       82    may be        provided          as
   one    or   more     bundles           of    hollow      fiber       membranes            or     as
   cascaded      sheet-membranes               disposed       within         the    absorption
   unit.
          After      most      of    the       remaining        CO 2     in    the     permeate
30 stream 58 has been absorbed into the liquid absorbent 72,
   a  low    pressure,        effluent          gas   stream        66    is    formed        which
   contains substantially CH 4 and a low concentration of CO 2 .
   In one embodiment, the effluent gas stream 66 contains no

                                                       13
   more than 10%             CO 2 . Effluent gas stream                      66    is     typically         at
   about 1 to 30 bars.                    Advantageously,                most of the CH 4 lost
   as   permeate          in     the     membrane            separation           unit       54     can     be
   recovered         by    the     membrane          contactor unit                 86     as    effluent
 5 gas   stream        66.      Further         advantageously,                  the     effluent         gas
   stream       66    can       be    directly            utilized          as     utility          gas     to
   generate         energy          on-site,            which          reduces          the      external
   energy      consumption            of     the     disclosed           system.             The     liquid
   absorbent          exiting          the      membrane              contactor           unit       86     as
10 liquid effluent               stream 76          is     rich in        CO   2  and may be             sent
   directly           to        storage            78          in       the        liquid            phase.
   Alternatively,               the      liquid          effluent           stream          76     may      be
   passed      to    post-treatment               units          for    sequestration               of    the
   CO 2  contained           therein.         Advantageously,                  the     absorbed          CO 2 ,
15 being     in    liquid         form,      is    easy        to transport              and does         not
   require        costly          compression                steps       to       render         the       CO 2
   storage-friendly.
                            Disclosure of Optional Embodiments
20        Exemplary,              non-limiting                embodiments             of     the      above
   method      for producing               natural          gas       according         to the        first
   aspect will now be disclosed.
          In     the      disclosed           method,           either        the     retentate           gas
   stream or the permeate                     gas      stream or both may be                       further
25 subjected         to    an     absorption             step       to   remove         CO 2 contained
   within      those       streams.             In      a    preferred           embodiment,            only
   the retentate             gas     stream is            subjected          to absorption              with
   a  liquid absorbent.                   In yet another embodiment,                            only the
   permeate        gas      stream        is     further           subjected          to     absorption
30 with a liquid absorbent.
          The contacting step                     (a)      may      further        comprise         a   step
   of   selecting             a    gas-separation                  membrane           that       is     more
   permeable         to     CO  2   relative           to      CH 4 .      The      gas      separation

                                           14

   or   as   a   bundle       of    hollow       fibers       disposed     within     a
   membrane    separator        unit.        In    one      embodiment,      the   gas
   separation membrane          is   made of cellulose acetate.                  Other
 5 suitable    gas    separation        membranes         may    be   selected    from
   the group including, but are not limited to, polysulfone,
   polyethylenimine,            and       polyamide/polimide               copolymer
   membranes.      In    another       embodiment,           the    gas   separation
   membrane      may       be      a    polyamide/polyimide               co-polymer
10 membrane.     An    example       of    such     polyamide/polyimide            co
   polymer    membranes        would     be     the     commercially       available
   Torlono membranes.
         The contacting step (a) may comprise a single stage,
   dual-stage or multi-stage gas separation step wherein the
15 feed natural      gas stream is           flowed through           the tube side
    (or  "lumen"~    side)      of   the     gas    separation         membrane    and
   wherein at least a fraction of the CO2 present within the
   feed    natural    gas     stream permeates             through     the  membrane
   into the "shell"         side to form a low pressure permeate gas
20 stream or vice versa.              In   this respect,           the pressure     of
   the permeate gas stream may -be from.about 1 bar -to about
   30 bars
         Where    the      contacting       step     (a)      is   a   single    stage
   membrane    separation        step,     the     CO 2    concentration      in   the
25 retentate stream may be in a range of about 20 % to about
   40   %.  Where    the     contacting        step      (a)   comprises     dual   or
   multi-stage membrane separation, the CO 2 concentration in
   the retentate stream may be in a range of from about 20 %
   to   about    10    %..       Additionally,            the    pressure     of   the
30 retentate stream may be from about about 20 bars to about
   100 bars     The passing         step    (b)   may comprise providing at
   least     one    permeable          membrane          disposed       within     the
   absorption     unit     to define       at    least one gas          flow   region

   and at      least      one liquid           flow region.              In one embodiment,
   the absorption unit may be a membrane contactor unit.
           The       permeable          membrane            may       be     composed         of      a
   substantially             microporous                 and       hydrophobic              polymer
 5 material.          The polymer material of the permeable membrane
   may       be      selected           from         the       group         consisting            of,
   polypropylene,                            polyvinylidene                              fluoride,
   polytetrafluoroethylene,                       polysulfone,             polyethylenimide,
   polyamide/polyimide,                  cellulose            acetate          or     co-polymers
10 thereof.          More    than one           membrane        may be        provided       within
   the    absorption        unit      in     a    spiral       wound,      cascade        sheet     or
   hollow fiber configuration.                         Each membrane may be made of
   the    same or different               polymer         material.            Preferably, the
   selected membrane             should exhibit. a large                    surface area and
15 should        be     substantially               compatible            with        the    liquid
   absorbent         to   minimize         membrane           fouling       or    wetting.          In
   one embodiment, the permeable membrane is a PVDF membrane
           The     passing       step       (b)      may     further        comprise        passing
   either      one     of   the     retentate            gas    stream       or    the    permeate
20 gas    stream       along     the      gas      flow      region      of     the    absorption
   unit.       The passing          step        (b)    may further          comprise        passing
   a   liquid absorbent             along        the     liquid flow region adjacent
   to the gas flow region,                   during which the CO 2 contained                        in
   the    retentate        gas     or     permeate          gas    is    absorbed         into     the
25 liquid       absorbent          through          the      pores       of      the    permeable
   membrane.          In one embodiment, the liquid absorbent stream
   and the adjacent gas stream may be passed counter-current
   with     respect       to   each       other        to    generate         maximal      partial
   pressure         difference           of       CO 2    between         the       two    phases.
30 Advantageously,            this       improves           the   mass       transfer        of    CO 2
   into     the     liquid     absorbent.                In    another        embodiment,          the
   liquid      absorbent         stream          may     be    passed       in     a   co-current
   configuration with respect to the gas stream.

                                                      16
              The passing step               (b)    may further             comprise        a   step of
    providing a liquid absorbent that is capable of absorbing
     CO 2    and    which      is      substantially              inert        to     the      membrane
    material.           In one embodiment, the liquid absorbent is sea
  5 water.          Advantageously,               using       sea      water       as    the       liquid
    absorbent         is    cost-effective             due     to its         wide     availability
    and negligible costs.
              In   one      embodiment,            the      retentate            stream        obtained
    directly        from      the     contacting           step       (a)     may     contain         less
 10 than      or   equal      to    10%    C0 2 , preferably               less     than      5%,     even
    more      preferably          less      than       3%    C0 2 .     Where       the     retentate
    stream       obtained         directly           from     the       contacting           step        (a)
    contains        less     than       10%    C0 2 , the        contacting           step      (a)     may
    comprise a multi-stage gas separation step.
 15          In    another        embodiment,            the      methane-rich             gas       phase
    obtained        directly         from      the     passing        step       (b)    may contain
    less      than    or equal          to    10%     C0 2 , preferably             less      than      5%,
    even more preferably less than 3% C0 2 .
             In one embodiment, where the retentate gas stream is
20  subjected to passing step                      (b),     the methane-rich gas phase
    may      be   pressurized,             having        pressures            in    the      range        of
    about 20        bars to about             100 bars.            In another embodiment,
    where       the    permeate          gas     stream        is    subjected           to     passing
    step       (b),     the    methane-rich              gas      phase        may     have        a    low
25  pressure, in the range of about 1 bar to about 30 bars

   permeate      gas     stream         may      be      routed       to      one      or   more
   absorption     units      to     recover a          low pressure,            methane-rich

          The above         disclosure provides an efficient,                            flexible
   and cost-effective method and system for                            removing CO 2 from
   high-CO 2         concentration                hydrocarbon           streams,               while
10 overcoming        the     known      technical         problems      in     the     state         of
   the art. For instance, the combination of one or more gas
   separation        units       with one         or more      downstream          absorption
   units     substantially            reduces         or   negates     hydrocarbon               loss
   during      the     separation          procedure,         thereby        improving             the
15 yield       of     CH 4      for      the      overall        method        and         system.
   Furthermore,          the use        of     membrane      contactor        units         as     the
   absorption           units         further          obviates        known          technical
   problems       associated           with      absorption       columns        as       the      gas
   and liquid phases do not mix directly.
20        Even      more        advantageously,             the    present         disclosure
   provides       a    flexible        and      customizable         method       and       system
   wherein         the       system          may       be     operated          to         produce
   substantially           low CO 2 content             natural     gas    directly            after
   an  initial        gas     separation          process      with a      trade-off             that
25 more     hydrocarbon            loss      will      be    experienced          during           gas
   separation          (but      which      is     recoverable        via     a    downstream
   absorption step).                 In the alternative,              the system may be
   operated       to minimize           hydrocarbon         loss    in   the     initial           gas
   separation         step      with      the     trade-off       that      more       CO 2     will
30 remain      entrained          in    the     retentate       gas,    which         is      to     be
   removed      during        a    further       absorption        step     in    a     membrane
   contactor        unit.         Such     flexibility         is   undoubtedly             useful
   in   plant        design         where        space      constraints          and        energy
