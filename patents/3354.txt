                                             BACKGROUND
   [0003]        It has been shown that high frequency forces, even at low magnitude, are able to

                                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [000441     Described herein are dental devices. The dental devices have or include a mouthpiece
   with a biteplate configured to sit over all or a portion of the occlusal surfaces of a patient's teeth.
 5 The dental devices can be configured to vibrate at a frequency between 60 and 120 HZ and an
   acceleration between 0.03G and 0.06G such that the mouthpieces places an axial vibratory force
   on the occlusal surfaces of the patient's teeth, thereby enhancing tooth growth.
   [000451      Referring to FIGS. IA-IC, a dental device 100 includes a mouthpiece 102 having an
   attached base 104. The mouthpiece 102 can be separable from the base 104. The mouthpiece
10 102 can include a biteplate 114 (with or without a separate mouthguard thereover, as described
   further below) and a mouthpiece extension 110 configured to connect with the base 104. In one
   embodiment (as shown in FIGS. IA-IC), the biteplate 114 can be approximately U-shaped so as
   to cover the occlusal surfaces of all or nearly all of the patient's teeth. Further, a motor 106 can
   be located in the mouthpiece 102 and configured to vibrate the mouthpiece 102. The base 104
15 can include the electronics necessary to run the motor 106. Contacts 108 can electrically connect
   the base 104 with the mouthpiece 106.
   [000461     As shown in FIG. 2, the motor 106 can be a counter-weighted motor extending in-line
   with the extension 110 (i.e. lay horizontal with its longitudinal axis parallel to the longitudinal
   axis of the extension 110). The motor 106 can include a counterweight 212 that is off-axis from
20 the longitudinal axis of the motor 106. As a result, when the motor 106 rotates, as shown by the
   arrow 111 in FIG. 2, the counterweight 212 moves up and down, causing the mouthpiece 102 to
   vibrate up and down, as shown by the arrows 11 3a-d in FIG. 2. Accordingly, referring to FIG.
   3C, when the mouthpiece 102 is placed in a patient's mouth and the dental device is 100 turned
   on, the vibration of the mouthpiece 102 will place axial vibratory force on the occlusal surface
25 320 of the teeth, i.e., the biteplate 114 (and any guard placed thereover, as described below) will
   move axially away from the occlusal surface 320 of the teeth and then back onto the occlusal
   surface 320 of the teeth repetitively. This "smacking" up and down motion can simulate the
   chewing motion. By simulating the chewing motion, bone in the mouth (e.g., teeth), can be
   strengthened through the body's natural mechanisms, i.e., bone growth can occur due to the
30 smacking motion.
    [00047]    In other embodiments, as shown in Figures 23A-23B, the motor 106 can be replaced
   with a pancake motor 2306 that includes a drum 2307 that moves up and down (shown by the
   arrows 2313a,b in FIG. 23B). The drum 2307 can be attached to two leads 2309a,b that can
   connect the drum 2307 with a power source 2311. The pancake motor 2306 can be placed in an
35 extension 2320 on the base 2304, as shown in FIG. 23A (the motor 2306 in an extension of the
                                                     -6-

     WO 2013/154737                                                               PCT/US2013/031225
   base is also shown in FIGS. 27A-C) or can be located with an extension on the mouthpiece.
   Further, in some embodiments, the pancake motor 2306 can be placed such that the motor
   extends just inside the teeth, as shown in FIG. 28. Similar to the motor 106, the motor 2306 can
   place axial vibratory force on the occlusal surface of the teeth, i.e., the mouthpiece can move
 5 axially away from the occlusal surface and then back onto the occlusal surface repetitively in a
   "smacking" motion.
   [00048]     It is to be understood that other types of motors can be used in place of motor 106 or
   motor 2306 to similarly cause the biteplate 114 to smack the teeth. For example, the motor could
   be a piezoelectric motor, a linear motor, or an electromagnetic motor. Further, it is to be
10 understood that the motors 106 and 2306 can be interchanged for any of the embodiments
   described herein. The motors used for the devices described herein can advantageously be small
   and lightweight. For example, the motor can be less than 2 grams, such as less than 1.5 grams,
   such as less than or equal to 1.2 grams. Further, the motor can be configured to require low
   current such that the power requirements are low. For example, the voltage required for the
15 motor to run can be less than 5 volts, such as less than 4 volts, less than 3 volts, or less than 2
   volts. In some embodiments, the motor requires between 0.5 and 4 volts, such as approximately
    1.5 volts. Further, the motor can advantageously consume less than 250mW of power, such as
   less than 200mW of power and/or can have an operating current of less than 1OOmA, such as less
   than 75mA, such as less than 65mA. As a result, the overall device (including the mouthpiece
20 and the base) can advantageously be less than 100 grams, such as less than 75 grams, less than
   50 grams, less than 40 grams, or less than 35 grams.
   [00049]     The motor 106 and/or motor 2306 can be configured to vibrate the mouthpiece 102 at
   frequencies between 60 HZ and 130 HZ, such as between 100 HZ and 120 HZ and at
   accelerations of 0.035 G to 0.100 G, such as 0.050 G to 0.060 G. These frequencies and
25 accelerations can advantageously increase bone growth in the mouth. The motors 106, 2306 can
   further be configured to oscillate between various vibration settings. For example, the motor 106
   can oscillate between four predetermined frequencies. In one embodiment, the motor 106
   oscillates between 60hz at 0.035G, 60hz at 0.060G, 120hz at 0.035G, and 120hz at 0.060G.
   Advantageously, by oscillating between frequency and acceleration settings, a patient's teeth will
30 be less likely to adapt to a particular vibration setting and will continue to strengthen and grow
   over time.
    [00050]     In some embodiments, as shown in FIGS. 3A-3B, the device 100 can include sensors
    118, such as piezoelectric sensors, configured to detect the acceleration or frequency of the
   vibration just proximate to the occlusal surfaces of the teeth. The sensors 118 can be placed, for
35 example, on the outside or the inside of the biteplate. The sensors 108 can be connected to
                                                     -7-

     WO 2013/154737                                                              PCT/US2013/031225
   circuitry that includes a feedback loop for running the motor 106. That is, when the mouthpiece
   102 touches the teeth, the surface contact and/or force between the mouthpiece 102 and the teeth
   can dampen the vibrations and/or slow the motor down. The feedback loop can therefore be
   used to compensate for the slowed motor.
 5 [00051]      Referring to FIG. 3D, a feedback loop can thus include applying vibration to the teeth
   with a dental device (such as device 100 or any device described herein) at step 371. The
   acceleration or frequency of the vibration can be sensed or measured at step 373 at or near the
   teeth, such as with the sensors 118. The sensed acceleration or frequency can be compared to the
   desired acceleration or frequency at step 375. At step 375, it can be determined whether the
10 frequency or acceleration is too low. If so, then the frequency or acceleration can be increased at
   step 377. If not, then it can be determined whether the sensed frequency or acceleration is too
   high at step 379. If so, then the frequency or acceleration can be decreased at step 381. The
   feedback loop can then repeat. Thus, the acceleration or frequency of the vibration at the motor
   can be adjusted to obtain the desired acceleration or frequencies at the mouthpiece 102 regardless
15 of the dampening effect caused by interaction with the teeth.
   [00052]      In one embodiment, shown in FIGS. 3A-3B, the motor 106 can be located within the
   extension 110 of the mouthpiece 102. Thus, for example, the extension 110 can have a pocket
    116 to house the motor 106. The motor 106 can be placed close to the biteplate 114, such as
   within 1mm of the biteplate 114, so that the motor 106 is located at least partially within the
20 patient's mouth, i.e., is located intraorally (see FIG. 3C). For example, the counterweight 212
   causing the vibration can be positioned so as to be located within the patient's mouth when the
   dental device 100 is in use. Having the motor 106 located intraorally advantageously both
   increases the ability of the mouthpiece 212 to smack against the occlusal surfaces of the patient's
   teeth and avoids having the device extend too far outside of the mouth, which can cause
25 discomfort to the patient if the base is intended to be used without hands.
   [000531      Although the motor has been described as inside of and inline with the extension 410
   of the mouthpiece 102, other configurations are possible. For example, referring to FIGS. 4A
   4B, in one embodiment, a dental device 400 can have a motor 406 that is located inside of the
   biteplate 414. Further, the motor 406 can lay horizontal within the extension 410, but be placed
30 such that its longitudinal axis extends perpendicular to the long-axis of the extension 410. The
   horizontal configuration of the motor still allows the counterweight 212 to provide a smacking
   motion while the perpendicular configuration allows the motor 406 to be located inside the teeth
   of a patient's mouth, for example sitting up against the roof of the mouth.
    [000541     Likewise, referring to FIGS. 5A-5B, the dental device 500 can have a motor 506 that
35  is located inside of the extension and that lays horizontal and perpendicular to extension 510. As
                                                      -8-

    WO 2013/154737                                                              PCT/US2013/031225
   described above, the horizontal configuration of the motor allows the counterweight 212 to
   provide a smacking motion, thereby enhancing tooth growth.
   [00055]     In some embodiments, the motors described herein can include an insulator
   theraround, such as a ceramic sleeve.
 5 [00056]     Referring to FIGS. 21 A-2 ID and 24A-26C, the devices described herein need not
   include a mouthpiece configured to cover all of the teeth. Rather, mouthpieces specifically
   targeting particular teeth can be used. It is to be understood that the mouthpieces shown and
   described with respect to FIGS. 21 A-21 D and 24A-26C can be used with any of the motors,
   bases, and guards described herein.
10 [00057]     For example, referring to FIGS. 24A-C, a mouthpiece 2402 can have a crescent shape
   biteplate 2414 configured to cover the social six teeth. Such a design can be advantageous, for
   example, for treating crowding in the social six teeth.
   [00058]     As another example, referring to FIGS. 25A-25C, a mouthpiece 2502 can have a
   double-hammer-shaped biteplate 2514 configured to cover only the molars. Such a design can
15 be advantageous, for example, for treating molar protraction or retraction. The biteplate 2514
   can thus include a narrow central portion 2482 configured to rest on the tongue and two
   elongated edge portions 2484a,b configured to rest on the occlusal surfaces of the molars.
   Further, the central portion 2482 can include a convex section 2499 configured to sit over the
   lounge for comfort and ease of use.
20 [00059]     As another example, referring to FIGS. 26A-26C, a mouthpiece 2602 can have an
   elongate biteplate 2614. The elongate biteplate 2614 can be configured to be placed on one side
   of the mouth and/or one quadrant of the teeth.
   [00060]     As another example, in one embodiment, shown in FIGS. 21A-21D, the device 211
   can include a rounded end or nub 213. The nub 213 can include the motor 215 therein, which
25 can be configured similarly to the motors described above. As shown in FIG. 21C-21D, by
   having only a nub 213 rather than a full mouthpiece, specific individual teeth in need of
   treatment can be targeted. Variations on the nub are possible. For example, referring to FIG. 22,
   the nub 2213 on device 2211 can include a brush 2207 on the end configured to provide a more
   gentle vibratory force on the teeth.
30 [00061]     Referring to FIGS. 7A and 7B, the biteplate 714 for any of the mouthpieces described
   herein can include raised dimples 732, or outward extensions. There can be approximately one
   dimple 732 for each tooth intended to be treated. Further, the dimples 732 can be spaced apart in
   such a manner as to approximately align with the center of some or all of the occlusal surfaces of
   a patient's teeth when the mouthpiece is in use. The dimples 732 can advantageously help the
35 mouthpiece effectively smack the teeth by providing an extended point of contact to ensure that
                                                     -9-

    WO 2013/154737                                                                  PCT/US2013/031225
   contact is made with each tooth. In some embodiments, the dimples 732 can be customized to a
   patient's tooth alignment. Each dimple 732 can have a peak that has a surface area of less than
   70%, such as less than 50%, of the surface area of the corresponding tooth so as to place pressure
   on less than 75% or less than 50% of each tooth.
 5 [000621      Referring to FIG. 8, the mouthpiece 802 (which can correspond to any mouthpiece
   described herein) can include two separable parts, the biteplate 814 and a mouthguard 834. The
   biteplate 814 can be made of a hard material, such as metal. The mouthguard can be made of a
   softer material such as a polymer.
   [00063]      In some embodiments, the mouthguard 834 can be custom fit to the patient's mouth.
10 By having a custom fit mouthguard 834, the mouthpiece 802 can be more efficient and effective
   in applying the vibratory smacking force on a patient's teeth. As shown in FIG. 8, the
   mouthguard 834 can include a hole 836 which can be used to place the mouthguard 834 over the
   biteplate 814 after formation.
   [00064]      Referring to FIG. 9, the mouthguard 834 can be produced quickly and easily on-site,
15 e.g., at a dentist's office, within minutes by using an oven 940. To form a mouthguard 834 using
   the oven 940, the mouthguard 834 can be made of a material such as silicone or an ethylene
   vinyl acetate copolymer, e.g., Elvax@, that is easily formable once warm. The oven 940 can
   include a heat source 941, such as infrared bulbs, a heat lamp, or heating coils, configured to heat
   up the mouthguard 814. A mouthguard preform 933 (i.e. one not yet formed to the teeth) can be
20 placed around a biteplate (which can be any of the biteplates described herein) and in the oven
   940. The mouthguard preform 933 and biteplate can be exposed to the heat source 941 for
   between I and 10 minutes at temperatures of between 1200 and 2000 F, less than 200', or less
   than 175'. Advantageously, as the mouthguard preform 933 warms, it can become slightly
   softer, thereby conforming to the shape of any dimples in the biteplate without losing its overall
25 shape. Further, once the mouthguard preform 933 is warmed up sufficiently, the user can take
   the mouthguard preform 933 out of the oven 940 and have the patient bite down, leaving an
   impression of the teeth in the mouthguard preform 933. Advantageously, by using temperatures
   of between 1200 and 2000 F, less than 200', or less than 1750 to heat the mouth guard, the
   mouthguard preform 933 will be cool enough upon entering a patient's mouth to not burn the
30 patient (in contrast to temperatures, for example, of over 2120). After the patient has bit down,
   and as the mouthguard preform 833 cools, it will retain its shape, thereby forming the final
    mouthguard 834.
    [00065]      The oven 940 can have a variety of configurations. In some embodiments, the oven
    940 is relatively small such that it can easily sit on a counter or table at the office. In some
35  embodiments, the oven 940 can include a drawer 932 with a handle, and the drawer 932 can be
                                                     -  10-

     WO 2013/154737                                                               PCT/US2013/031225
   configured to hold the mouthguard preform 933. In another embodiment, the oven 940 can
   include a shelf 992 and a hinged door 994. The oven 940 can further include a power switch, an
   indicator light, a timer, and/or a display to enhance ease of use.
   [00066]     In some embodiments, shown in FIG. 11, the mouthguard 1134 can have vacuum
 5 ports 1144 to provide suction to exactly fit the mouthguard 1134 to all of the surfaces of the teeth
   before the mouthpiece 1134 cools completely. The vacuum ports 1144 can be removed after the
   mouthguard 1134 is fully formed.
   [000671     As shown in FIGS. 13A-13F, a mouthpiece 1302 of the dental devices described
   herein need not be formed to a patient's mouth, but can have a set shape. Further, as shown in
10 Figures 13A-13F, the mouthpiece need not include a separate biteplate and mouthguard. Rather,
   the mouthpiece can be formed of a single piece.
   [000681     Any of the mouthpieces described herein can be connected to a base, such as base 104
   or an alternative base. For example, referring to FIG. 6, a base 604 can be connected to any of
   the mouthpieces described herein. The base 604 can include a housing 622, an on-off switch 624
15 to control the vibration, electrical contacts 630 to electrically connect the base 604 with a
   mouthpiece, a battery 626 to power the motor, and a circuit board 628 to control the motor. The
   base 604 can be shaped such that it is easily held by a patient's hand. In one embodiment, the
   base 604 is small and light enough that it does not need to be gripped by the patient during use of
   the device.
20  [00069]    As another example, referring to FIGS. 27A-28, a base 2804 can be connected to any
   of the mouthpieces described herein. The base 2804 can include a handle 2881 configured to be
   easily held by a single hand and a mouthpiece connector 2887. The handle 2881 can include a
   grip portion 2885 that can include indents 2883, such as four indents, configured to provide
   comfortable resting spot for a person's fingers when gripping the handle 2881. As shown in
25 FIG. 28, the handle 2881 can be curved such that the grip portion 2885 can be gripped with a
   hand without having to tilt the device forward or up. For example, the angle between the grip
   portion 2885 and the mouthpiece connector 2887 can be between 30 and 60 degrees, such as
   approximately 45 degrees. Referring back to FIGS. 27A-27C, the base 2804 can house the
   power source, such as a battery, for the motor therein. The base 2804 can include an on-off
30  switch 2824 to control the vibration. Further, in some embodiments, the base 2804 can include a
   battery indicator light 2893 thereon to indicate the amount of battery left. In some embodiments,
   the base 2804 can also include contacts 2891 thereon to interact with a charging station, as
    described below.
    [00070]     Referring to FIGS. 12A-12D, another exemplary base 1204 can be used with any of
35 the mouthpieces described herein. As shown in FIGS. 12A-12D, the base 1204 can include a
                                                    - 11 -

   motor 1206 therein (in place of or in addition to the motor in the mouthpiece). By including the
   motor in the base, there is advantageously more room for the connection to the battery while
   allowing the mouthpiece to be as slim as possible. For example, the mouthpiece 1202 can be free
   of a motor.
 5 [000711     As shown in FIGS. 12A-12D, and 18-20 the mouthpieces can be configured to
   connect to the base in a variety of ways. For example, as shown in FIGS. 12A-12B, the base
   1204 can include an extension 1220 to house the motor 1206, while the extension 1210 of the
   mouthpiece 1202 can include a hole 1221 therein to fit over or house the extension 1220 of the
   base 1204. In contrast, in reference to FIGS. 12C-12D, the base 1204 can include an extension
10 1220 having a hole 1222 therein that both holds the motor 1206 and engages with our houses the
   extension 1210 of the mouthpiece 1202. The extension 1210 of the mouthpiece 1202 can
   include a corresponding cut-out 1232 to fit over the motor 1206 when it is snapped into the base
   1204.
   [000721     In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 18, the base 1804 and the mouthpiece 1802 can
15 be attached together with a mechanical connector 1844 that can set the orientation of connection
   and that can be released through a release button 1846. In another embodiment, shown in FIG.
   29, the base 1904 and the mouthpiece 1902 can be attached together through a fork-type
   mechanical connection 1948; squeezing the fork portions together can lock or unlock the
   connection 1948. In yet another embodiment, shown in FIG. 20, a tightening collar 2050 can be
20 used to connect a base 2004 and mouthpiece 2002.
   [000731     Further, as shown in FIGS. 14A-14B, in some embodiments, the dental devices
   described herein can include a flexible portion 1444 between the mouthpiece 1402 and the base
   1404. For example, the flexible portion 1444 can include a series of cut-outs that allow the
   portion 1444 to easily bend. The flexible portion 1444 to provide enhanced comfort to the
25 patient, for example, by limiting the amount of vibration that occurs outside of the mouth and by
   reducing the amount of torque that occurs on the mouth through the bite plate if the base is
   torqued suddenly. The flexible portion can have an oval-like cross-section that easily conforms
   to the patient's mouth, thereby enhancing the comfort of the patient.
   [000741     As shown in FIGS. 15-17, the devices described herein can be configured to be
30 charged in a charging station, for example using a standard mini usb connection. As shown in
   FIG. 15A, the charging station can include a protective covering 1502 configured to protect the
   device while not in use. The protective covering 1502 can then be placed in a charging base (not
   shown in FIGS. 15A-15B). As shown in FIGS. 16A-16D, the charging station 1600 can include
   a protective covering 1602 and a charging base 1604. A connector slot 1606 can be used to sit
35 the case 1602 in the charging base 1604. As shown in FIG. 16C, charging pins 1608 can connect
                                                   - 12 -

   from the charging base 1604 through the protecting covering 1602 and into the device 1610 to
   charge the device. An indicator light 1612 can indicate whether the charging station 1600 is
   charging. A similar station 1700 is shown in FIGS. 17A-17D. It is to be understood that other
   sizes, shapes, and types of charging stations could be used.
 5 [000751      Once formed and assembled, the dental devices described herein can be used to
   strengthen the bone around teeth and tighten the ligaments around teeth such as for retention, e.g.
   orthodontic retention after braces are removed. For example, the device can be placed in the
   mouth for less than 10 minutes per day, such as less than 6 minutes, such as approximately 5
   minutes, less than 5 minutes, or less than 1 minute per day for less than or equal to 180 days, less
10 than or equal to 120 days, or less than or equal to 90 days to tighten the periodontal ligament
   after orthodontics. Such use can be in addition to or in place of traditional retainers. Use of the
   device can advantageously significantly decrease the time required for tightening of the
   periodontal ligament (from the average of six months to a year). Further, in some embodiments,
   the dental device can also be used for less than 2 minutes per day, such as less than 1 minute per
15 day, on a continuing basis to provide general tooth strengthening. Further, the dental devices
   described herein can also be used for strengthening bone during dental implant procedures,
   tightening ligaments, strengthening bone after periodontics cleaning and procedures, such as
   after bone grafting.
    [000761     Variations on the devices described herein are possible. For example, in some
20 embodiments, the devices can have a microchip or Bluetooth connected thereto to record when
   and how long the device was used for. Further, it is to be understood that the various elements of
   the mouthpieces and bases described herein with reference to specific embodiments could be
   substitute and/or combined with other embodiments described herein.
