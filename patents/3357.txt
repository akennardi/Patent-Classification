              NON-NATURAL CONSENSUS ALBUMIN BINDING DOMAINS
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
             The present application is a divisional application of Australian Application No.
 5 2013266215, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.
             The present invention relates to albumin binding domains and methods of making
   and using them. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a non-natural
   albumin binding domain consensus sequence and variants thereof as described herein.
10 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
             Rapid elimination of biotherapeutic molecules via renal clearance contributes to
   limited clinical effectiveness or more frequent dosing for the patient. Renal clearance due to
   glomerular filtration is most associated with smaller biotherapeutics, as the rates of kidney
   filtration are greatly reduced for molecules with a molecular weight of greater 50,000 daltons
15 (Kontermann, Curr Opin Biotechnol 22:868-76, 2011). Several approved biotherapeutic
   drugs contain active portions that on their own fall below the filtration limit and are thus
   cleared quickly. To overcome this limitation, a number of technologies have been introduced
   to effectively increase the size of the therapeutic molecule to reduce kidney filtration and
   resulting half-life.
20           PEGylation (PEG) of therapeutics is an effective way to increase the hydrodynamic
   radius of the protein and reduce glomerular filtration. One or several PEG chains can be
   coupled to the protein most commonly through conjugation to free thiol or amine groups on
   the protein surface. PEGylated versions of Adenosine deaminase, L-Asparaginase, Interferon
   alpha-2b, G-CSF, Human Growth Hormone, Erythropoietin, Uricase, and an anti-TNFalpha
25 antibody fragment have all been approved for human therapy (Kontermann, Curr Opin
   Biotechnol 22:868-76, 2011). Limitations of PEGylation include production of
   heterogeneous products and difficulty in controlling the number of PEG molecules attached
   to certain proteins. PEGylation introduces additional conjugation as well as purification steps
   to the production of therapeutic proteins, resulting in decreased yields and increased costs of
30 goods. PEGylation may also lead to renal tubular vacuolization in animals and patients as
   PEG chains are non-degradable in the kidneys (Gaberc-Porekar et al., Curr Opin Drug Discov
   Devel 11:242-250, 2008).
             Coupling a therapeutic to an antibody Fc region to generate Fc-fusion proteins can be
   used to increase the serum half-life of therapeutic molecules. Immunoglobulins may exhibit
                                                   1

long half-lives on the order of several weeks in humans due to their large size and recycling
through FcRn (Kuo et al., J Clin Immunol 30:777-789, 2010). TNF receptor 2, LFA-3,
                                             la

   CTLA-4, IL-IR, and TPO-mimetic peptide molecules are all approved therapies produced as
   Fe-fusions (Kontermanm, Curr Opin Biotechnol 22:868-76, 2011). Fe-fusion proteins are not
   ideal for all therapeutic classes for several reasons. The homodimeric nature of the Fc region
   results in the production of a dimeric therapeutic protein, possibly leading to cellular
 5 activation due to receptor clustering. Fc-fusions must also be made in mammalian expression
   systems which may be more costly than prokaryotic systems.
            In addition to Fe, albumin exhibits a long half-life in vivo due to FeRn recycling. At
   a concentration of approximately 40 g/L, Human Serum Albumin (HSA) is the most
   abundant protein found in the blood. FcRn recycling leads to a long half-life of
10 approximately 19 days in humans. Additionally, biodistribution studies suggest that albumin
   may distribute within the body to areas important for targeting disease, such as inflamed
   joints or tumors (Wunder et aL, Jmmunol 170:4793-4801, 2003). Thus, the serum half-life
   of a number of proteins has been increased by producing them as either C-terminal or N
   terminal fusions to HSA. Successful fusions include interferon alpha (Flisiak and Flisiak,
15 Expert Opin Biol Ther 10:1509-1515, 2010), human growth hormone (Osborn et al., Eur I
   Pharmacol 456:149-158, 2002), tumor necrosis factor (Muller et al., Biochem Biophys Res
   Common 396:793-799, 2010), coagulation factor IX (Metzner et al, Thromb Haemost 102:
   634-644, 2009), coagulation factor Vlla (Schulte, Thromb Res 122 Suppl 4: S14-19, 2008),
   insulin (Duttaroy et al., Diabetes 54:251-258, 2005), urokinase (Breton etal, Eur J Biochem
20 231:563-569, 1995), hirudin (Sheffield et al.. Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis 12:433-443,2001),
   and bispecific antibody fragments (Muller et al, I Biol Chem 282:12650-12660, 2007). HSA
   fusion proteins may have long serum half-lives, however large scale production of these
   fusion proteins is limited predominantly to yeast expression systems. Additionally, the large
   size of HSA may lead to a loss in activity of the therapeutic due to steric hindrance.
25          Therapeutic proteins may also be produced as fusion proteins to peptides or proteins
   that bind to serum albumin in the blood stream to increase their half life. Such albumin
   binding peptides include cysteine-constrained peptides or antibody fragments to albumin.
   Expression of a Fab antibody fragment as a fusion to eysteine-constrained peptides
   significantly increased the serum half-life of the Fab (Dennis et al, I Biol Chem 277:35035
30 35043, 2002; US2004/0253247A1). Coupling cysteie-constrained peptide to an antibody
   fragment led to better peak tumor accumulation and more homogeneous tumor distribution
   compared to Fab and mAb molecules targeting the same antigen (Dennis et al., Cancer Res
   67:254-261, 2007; US2005/0287153A 1). Further, a number of antibody fIagments that bind
   specifically to albumin have been coupled to therapeutic moieties to increase the half life of
35 the therapeutic. A camelid Vi antibody fragment (Nanobodies@) that binds to HSA was
                                                    2

   fused to another Nanobody@ that binds to TNF-alpha (Coppieters et aL. Arthritis Rheum 54:
    1856-1866, 2006) or anti-EGFR Nanobodies@ (Tijink et al., Mol Cancer Ther 7:2288-2297,
   2008). Anti-albumin domain antibodies (dAbs) have been generated that bind to albumin,
   and have been fused to, for example, interleuldn-1 receptor (Bolt et aL. Protein Eng Des Se]
 5 21:283-288, 2008) and interferon alpha 2b (Walker et al, Protein Eng Des Sel 23:271-278,
   2010) to improve their half life.
             A number of naturally occurring protein domains from bacteria are known to interact
   with albumin, presumably to help such bacteria distribute throughout the host organism.
   These are 3-helix bundle protein domains approximately 6 kDa in size which use one face of
10 the 3-helix bundle to interact with serum albumin (Cramer et al., FEBS Lett 581:3178-3182,
   2007; Lejon el al., Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun 64:64-69, 2008;
   Johansson et al. FEBS Lett 374:257-261, 1995; Johansson et al. J Mol Biol 266:859-865,
    1997; Johansson et al., I Biol Chem 277:8114-8120,2002). One such albumin binding
   domain derived from streptococcal protein G (Jonsson et al, Protein Eng Des Sel 21:515
15 527, 2008), has been most widely used to extend the serum half-life of proteins. Fusion to
   this domain has been shown to increase the half-life of soluble complement receptor type I
   (Makrides et aL, J Pharnacol Exp Ther 277:534-542, 1996), a bispecific antibody (Stork et
   al., Protein Eng Des Sel 20:569-576, 2007), CD4 (Nygren et al., Vaccines 91:363-368, 1991;
   US 6267,964B1), Pfl55/RESA (Stahl et al., J hnmunol Methods 124:43-52, 1989), G-CSF
20 (Frejd, F. PEGS Europe, October 5, 2010), and affibody molecules binding to a number of
   targets (Andersen et al., J Biol Chem 286:5234-5241, 2011) (Frejd, F. PEGS Europe, October
   5, 20 10). However, antibody production against the domain has been reported in patients and
   thus the use of the molecule for therapeutic applications may be challenging (Goetsch et a.,
   Clin Diagn Lab Immuno] 10:125-132, 2003; Libon et al.Vaccine 17:406-414, 1999)
25          A number of protein domains or peptides that bind to albumin are capable of
   extending the serum half-life and producing a more beneficial biodistribution pattern of
   therapeutic proteins. In order to use these albumin binding domains in therapeutic
   applications, a number of biophysical requirements need to be fulfilled, such as high
   expression levels in a host, solubility and stability, and minimal immunogenicity. The
30 albumin binding moiety should bind to serum albumin with an affinity that effectively
   balances serum half-life and biodistribution with activity of the therapeutic moiety when
   bound and not bound to albumin.

30
   Albumin binding domain compositions
              The present invention provides a synthetic albumin binding domain (ABDCon)
   (SEQ ID NO: 21) and variants thereof. ABDCon can be operably linked to a bioactive
   agent for enhancement ofserum half-life and biodistribution of the therapeutic agent.
35 ABDCon and variants thereof can be expressed at high levels in E. coli, are soluble, and
                                                       6

   have high thermal stability. The present invention provides polynucleotides encoding
   ADBCon and variants thereof, complementary nucleic acids, vectors, host cells, and
   methods of making and using them.
            The present invention further provides synthetic albumin binding domain
 5 (ABDCon) that has an extension of 5 amino acid extension at the N-tenninus. The
   extension improves stability of ABDCon.
            The ABDCon binding domain was designed by calculating a consensus amino
   acid sequence of certain 3-helix bundle albumin binding domain (ABD) sequences
   deposited in the non-redundant protein database using ABD from Streptococcus sp. G148
10 protein G (SEQID NO: 1) as a template, and selecting the most prevalent amino acid at
   each sequence position (Table 6). ABDCon has a high affinity to human albumin with a
   KD of 75 pM and Kfr of 3.02x10' I/s when tested with conditions specified herein, and
   therefore bioactive agents operably linked to ABDCon may be largely bound to albumin
   once administered to an animal patient. In a human patient, molecules binding serum
15 albumin too weakly will have short serum half-life due to renal filtering (Hopp et at.,
   Protein Eng Des Sel 23:827-834, 2010), whereas molecules binding sem albumin too
   tightly will not be released from albumin at the preferred site of action, and thus in some
   cases may have reduced ability to modulate activity of the desired target and provide a
   therapeutic benefit. It is therefore one aspect of the invention to have and be able to
20 generate ABDCon variants and binding domains having a spectrum of affinities to
   albumin and hence provide the ability to modulate the half life of the bioactive agent
   operably linked to ABDCon variants and binding domains.
            One embodiment of the invention is an isolated non-natural albumin binding
   domain comprising an amino acid sequence at least 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%,
25 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO: 21
   (ABDCon): LKEAKEKAIEELKKAGITSDYYFDLINKAKTVEGVNALKDEILKA.
            Another embodiment of the invention is an isolated albumin binding domain
   comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 21 having substitutions at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
   or 6, residues.
30          ABDCon variants can be designed by examining the crystal structure of an
   exemplary 3-helix bundle albumin binding protein in complex with albumin and making
   an assumption that ABDCon may bind albumin in a manner similar to the exemplary
   protein. An exemplary crystal structure that can be utilized is that of a GA module
   (protein G-related albumin-binding module) of protein PAB of an anaembic bacterium
                                                  7

   Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus) in complex with human albumin
   (Protein Data Base (PDB) code ITFO (Leion et al., I Biol Chem 279:42924-42928, 2004).
            ABDCon variants having decreased affinity for albumin can be designed by
   various strategies, such as by disrupting predicted hydrophobic contacts, disrupting
 5 predicted pi-stacking between aromatic residues, introducing sterile clashes by substitution
   with larger amino acids, disrupting salt bridges by removal of charged residues, and
   disrupting hydrogen bonding predicted to occur between ABDCon and albumin.
   Introduced changes are designed to decrease binding affinity without changing the binding
   surface in a way that would abolish binding. For example, residue Y21 can be substituted
10 for charged amino acids (Lys, Arg, Asp, Glu) or smaller amino acids (Ala, Gly) to reduce
   hydrophobic interactions between this residue and albumin residues V325 and F326. In
   addition, Y21 of ABDCon fonns a hydrogen bond with the backbone of albumin residues
   N3 18 and D324 such that minor changes such as mutation to Phe may slightly weaken
   interactions. Residue Y22 of ABDCon is predicted to form hydrophobic as well as pi
15 stacking interactions with albumin residues F309 and F326. Therefore substitution ofY22
   for smaller neutral amino acids Ala, Ser, Val or charged amino acids Lys, Arg, Asp, or
   Glu may decrease hydrophobic contacts and reduced affinity of the ABDCon variant to
   albumin. Residue K30 in ABDCon is predicted to form a salt-bridge with albumin residue
   E227 and thus K30 can be substituted for Asp or Glu to introduce repulsive charges and
20 potentially reduce ABDCon affinity to albumin. Mutation to any non-charged amino acid
   may also reduce affinity by eliminating the salt-bridge. ABDCon residue T31 is predicted
   to form an intermolecular hydrogen bond with albumin residue N267 and substitutions for
   Ala or Gly can be used to disrupt the intermolecular hydrogen bond without introducing a
   large steric clash that might significantly destabilize the interaction. ABDCon residue
25 A37 can be substituted for Val, Tyr, or other larger amino acid in order to introduce steric
   clashes. Residue E41 can be substituted for Gln or Asn to remove charge. Introduction of
   positively charged residues such as Lys or Arg can be expected to further reduce binding
   affinity. ABDCon residues L25, E33, G34, L38, 142, and A45 are predicted to form direct
   contact with albumin, and substitutions at these residues are likely to modulate ABDCon
30 affinity to albumin Residue positions refer to ABDCon of SEQ ID NO: 21 and human
   albumin of SEQ ID NO: 36.
            Alternatively, a random cocktail of amino acids can be used, utilizing for example
   NNK codons for substitutions at identified positions, and the resulting variants are
   measured for their binding to albumin using standard methods and methods described
35 herein.

   residue selected from Y21, Y22, L25, K30, T31, E33, G34, A37, L38, E41, 142 and A45
   of SEQ ID NO: 21.
            Exemplary ABDCon variants are variants having substitutions in at least one
 5 residue selected from Y21, Y22, K30, T31, A37 and E41 of SEQ ID NO: 21.

            vi) X6 is Glutamine (Q), Asparagine (N), Lysine (K), Arginine (R) or Glutamate
20               (E).
            In other embodiments, an exemplary ABDCon variant comprises and amino acid
   sequence LKEAKEKAIEELKKAGITSDXiX2FDLINKAX 3X4VEGVNXsLKDX61LKA
   (SEQ ID NO: 24), wherein
            i) Xi is Lysine (K), Alanine (A) or Tyrosine (Y);
25          ii) X2 is Alanine (A), Serine (S), Valine(V) or Tyrosine (Y);

            vi) X6 is Glutamine (Q) or Glutamate (E).
30          Additional exemplary ABDCon variants comprise amino acid sequences shown in
   SEQ ID NOs: 25-34. ABDCon variants are tested for albumin binding using well known
   methods, for example in an in viro assay using plasmon resonance (BIAcore, GE
   Healthcare Uppsala, Sweden). The measured affinity of a particular ABDCon
   variant/albumin interaction can vary if measured under different conditions (e.g.,
35 osmolarity, pH). Thus, measurements of affinity and other binding parameters (e.g., K,
                                                     9

   K_, Kor) are preferably made with standardized solutions of ABDCon variant and
   albumin, and a standardized buffer, such as the buffer described herein. Affinity of
   ABDCon variants to albumin may range from at least about Ixi14M, at least about l x10
   M, at least about lxl10^7 M, at least about lx10 M, at least about Ix10^ M, at least about
 5  lxl 0   M, at least about lxl0^" M, at least about Ixl 0^' M, or at least about Ix0" M.
   For example, various substitutions at Y22 of ABDCon (SEQ ID NO: 21) reduced affinity
   of the variants to albumin about 300 - 1,000 fold depending on a substitution (Table 4).
   Additional variants having substitutions at defined positions or at combinations of
   positions can be designed and generated by those skilled in the art and tested for a desired
10 albumin binding affinity using routine methods.
             ABDCon and variants thereof can further be modified by addition of a 5 amino
   acid extension to the N-terminus of ABDCon or ABDCon variant. The 5 amino acid
   extension may consist of an amino acid sequence TIDEWL (SEQ ID NO: 43), or any
   amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NOs: 42 or 45-55. Incorporating the N-terminal 5
15 amino acid extension into the ABDCon and variants thereof can increase the stability of
   the molecule. The N-terminal 5 amino acid extension may be structurally ordered as part
   of the first alpha helix of ABDCon and variants. The improved stability of the N
   terminally extended molecules may therefore result from stabilizing the overall structure
   of the helix. The N-terminal ABDCon variants can be made using standard methods and
20 their stability, for example thermal stability, assessed as described herein. Any albumin
   binding domain (ABD) may be modified with the addition of the 5 N-terminal amino acids
   to stabilize the ABD structure and improve stability, such as thermal stability of the
   resulting molecule.
             ABDCon and variants thereof can be further modified at residues not affecting
25 binding to albumin for the purpose of for example improving stability, reducing
   immunogenicity, improving solubility, or any other suitable characteristics. In one way to
   achieve this goal, the ABDCon and variants thereof can be optionally prepared by a
   process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual engineered products
   using three-dimensional models of the parental and engineered sequences. Three
30 dimensional models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art.
   Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional
   conformational structures of selected candidate sequences and can measure possible
   immunogenicity (e.g., Immunofilter program of Xencor, Inc. of Monrovia, CA).
   Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the
35 functioning of the candidate sequence, for example, residues that influence stability of the
                                                   10

   ABDCon domain. In this way, residues can be selected and combined from the parent and
   reference sequences so that the desired characteristics, such as improved stability is
   achieved. Alternatively, or in addition to the above procedures, other suitable methods of
   engineering can be used as known in the art.
 5           Desirable physical properties of albumin binding domains of the invention include
   high thermal stability and reversibility of thermal folding and unfolding. Several methods
   have been applied to increase the apparent thermal stability of proteins and enzymes,
   including rational design based on comparison to highly similar thermostable sequences,
   design of stabilizing disulfide bridges, mutations to increase alpha-helix propensity,
10 engineering of salt bridges, alteration of the surface charge of the protein, directed
   evolution, and composition of consensus sequences (Lehmann and Wyss, Curr Opin
   Biotechnol 12:371-375, 200 1). High thermal stability may increase the yield of the
   expressed protein, improve solubility or activity, decrease immunogenicity, and minimize
   the need of a cold chain in manufacturing.
15           Residues that can be substituted to improve any characteristics of the albumin
   binding domains the invention can be determined by making the substitution and assaying
   for the desired characteristics of the albumin binding domain. For example, alanine
   scanning may be employed to identify positions in ABDCon and variants thereof that may
   affect the stability of the albumin binding domain.
20           In terms of loss of stability, i.e., "denaturing" or "denaturation" of a protein, is
   meant the process where some or all of the three-dimensional conformation imparting the
   functional properties of the protein has been lost with an attendant loss of activity and/or
   solubility. Forces disrupted during denaturation include intramolecular bonds, for
   example, electrostatic, hydrophobic, Van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds, and
25 disulfides. Protein denaturation can be caused by forces applied to the protein or a
   solution comprising the protein, such as mechanical force (for example, compressive or
   shear-force), thermal, osmotic stress, change in pH, electrical or magnetic fields, ionizing
   radiation, ultraviolet radiation and dehydration, and by chemical denaturants.
             Measurement of protein stability and protein lability can be viewed as the same or
30 different aspects of protein integrity. Proteins are sensitive or "labile" to denaturation
   caused by heat, by ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, changes in the ambient osmolarity and
   pH if in liquid solution, mechanical shear force imposed by small pore-size filtration,
   ultraviolet radiation, ionizing radiation, such as by gamma irradiation, chemical or heat
   dehydration, or any other action or force that may cause protein structure disruption. The
35 stability of the molecule can be determined using standard methods. For example, the
                                                     II

   stability of a molecule can be determined by measuring the thermal melting (T.)
   temperature, the temperature in * Celsius (*C) at which half of the molecules become
   unfolded, using standard methods. Typically, the higher the Tm, the more stable the
   molecule. In addition to heat, the chemical environment also changes the ability of the
 5 protein to maintain a particular three dimensional structure.
             Chemical denaturation can likewise be measured by a variety of methods.
   Chemical denaturants include guanidinium hydrochloride, guanadinium thiocyanate, urea,
   acetone, organic solvents (DMF, benzene, acetonitrile), salts (ammonium sulfate lithium
   bromide, lithium chloride, sodium bromide, calcium chloride, sodium chloride); reducing
10 agents (e.g. dithiothreitol, beta-mercaptoethanol, dinitrothiobenzene, and hydrides, such as
   sodium borohydride), non-ionic and ionic detergents, acids (e.g. hydrochloric acid (HCI),
   acetic acid (CH3COOH), halogenated acetic acids), hydrophobic molecules (e.g.
   phosopholipids), and targeted denaturants. Quantitation of the extent of denaturation can
   rely on loss of a functional property, such as ability to bind a target molecule, or by
15 physiochenical properties, such as tendency to aggregation, exposure of formerly solvent
   inaccessible residues, or disruption or formation of disulfide bonds.
             The ABDCon binding domain and variants thereof may be operably linked to a
   bioactive agent. Exemplary bioactive agents are peptides and proteins that may be
   operably linked to ABDCon and variants thereof using well known linkers, for example a
20 tinker containing poly-glycine, glycine and serine (Gly-Ser linker), or alanine and proline.
   The use of naturally occurring as well as artificial peptide linkers is well known in the
   literature (Hallewell et al, I Biol Chem 264:5260-5268, 1989; Alfthan r al., Protein Eng.
   8:725-731, 1995; Robinson & Sauer, Biochemistry 35:109-116, 1996; U.S. Pat. No.
   5,856,456). The bioactive agent may be linked to the ABDCon or variant thereof from its
25 C-or N-terminus. Multi-specific bioactive agents may also be linked to ABDCon. In
   these cases, ABDCon may be linked to the N-terminus or C-terminus of the molecule.
   ABDCon may also be positioned internally in such a multispecific agent such that it is
   linked to the C-terminus of one agent and the N-terminus of another. Bioactive agents
   may also be coupled to the albumin binding domains of the invention using chemical
30 crosslinking well known in the art, for example using hydrazone or semicarbazone
   linkage. Exemplary bioactive agents are proteins specifically binding a target antigen such
   as proteins identified from fibronectin type III (FN3) repeat protein libraries, such as
   Tencon25-based libraries described in W0201 1/137319A2 and W02010/093627A2.
            Additional moieties may be incorporated into ABDCon or variants thereof ofthe
35 invention, such as toxin conjugates, polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules, such as
                                                 12

   PEG5000 or PEG20,000, fatty acids and fatty acid esters of different chain lengths, for
   example laurate, myristate, stearate, arachidate, behenate, oleate, arachidonate, octanedioic
   acid, tetradecanedioic acid, octadecanedioic acid, docosanedioic acid, and the like,
   polylysine, octane, carbohydrates (dextran, cellulose, oligo- or polysaccharides) for
 5 desired properties. These moieties may be direct fusions with the ABDCon coding
   sequences and may be generated by standard cloning and expression techniques.
   Alternatively, well known chemical coupling methods may be used to attach the moieties
   to recombinantly produced ABDCon of the invention.
            ABDCon and variants thereof, as well as fusion proteins of bioactive agents and
10 ABDCon can be assessed for their half life using well known pharmacokinetic properties
   in in vivo models. Exemplary ABDCon and variants thereof bind albumin with KD of
   about between 1 pM - I pM, between 75 pM - 860 nM, between 100 pM - 500 nM, or
   between I nM - 100 nM.
15 Generation and Production of ABDCon and variants thereof
             Generation of the albumin binding domains of the invention is typically achieved
   at the nucleic acid level using standard methods. ABDCon variants having substituted
   codons at one or more specific residues can be synthesized for example using standard
   PCR cloning methods, or chemical gene synthesis according to methods described in U.S.
20 Pat. No. 6,521,427 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,670,127, or using Kunkel mutagenesis (Kunkel et
   aL. Methods Enzymol 154:367-382, 1987). If randomized codons are to be used for any
   residue positions, randomization can be accomplished using well known methods, for
   example degenerate oligonucleotides matching the designed diversity, or for example
   using NNK codons, which encode all 20 naturally occurring amino acids. In other
25 diversification schemes, DVK codons can be used to encode amino acids Ala, Trp, Tyr,
   Lys, Thr, Asn, Lys, Ser, Arg, Asp, Glu, Gly, and Cys. Alternatively, NNS codons can be
   used to give rise to all 20 amino acid residues and simultaneously reducing the frequency
   of stop codons. The codon designations are according to the well known IUB code.
             Synthesis of oligonucleotides with selected nucleotide "degeneracy" at certain
30 positions is well known in that art, for example the TRIM approach (Knappek et a, JIMol
   Biol 296:57-86, 1999; Garrard & Henner, Gene 128:103-109, 1993). Such sets of nucleotides
   having certain codon sets can be synthesized using commercially available nucleotide or
   nucleoside reagents and apparatus.
             Standard cloning and expression techniques are used to clone ABDCon or variants
35 thereof into a vector or synthesize double stranded cDNA of ABDCon to express, or to
                                                   13

   translate the protein in vitro. Bioactive agents can be operably linked to ABDCon or variants
   thereof using well known methods.
   Nucleic Acid Molecules and Vectors
 5          The invention provides for nucleic acids encoding ABDCon or variants thereof of
   the invention as isolated polynucleotides or as portions of expression vectors or as portions
   of linear DNA sequences, including linear DNA sequences used for in vitro
   transcription/translation, vectors compatible with prokaryotic, eukaryotic or filamentous
   phage expression, secretion and/or display of the compositions. Certain exemplary
10 polynucleotides are disclosed herein, however, other polynucleotides which, given the
   degeneracy of the genetic code or codon preferences in a given expression system, encode
   ABDCon or variants thereof of the invention are also within the scope of the invention.
            The polynucleotides of the invention may be produced by chemical synthesis, such as solid
   phase polynucleotide synthesis on an automated polynucleotide synthesizer and assembled into
15 complete single or double stranded molecules. Alternatively, the polynucleotides of the invention
   may be produced by other techniques, such as a PCR followed by routine cloning. Techniques for
   producing or obtaining polynucleotides of a given known sequence are well known in the ar.
            The polynucleotides of the invention may comprise at least one non-coding
   sequence, such as a promoter or enhancer sequence, intron, polyadeniylation signal, and the
20 like. The polynucleotide sequences may also comprise additional sequences encoding
   additional amino acids that encode for example a marker or a tag sequence such as a hexa
   histidine or an HA tag to facilitate purification or detection of the protein, a signal
   sequence, a fusion protein partner, such as cDNA encoding a bioactive agent, and the like.
            An exemplary polynucleotide comprises sequences encoding ABDCon, sequences
25 for a ribosome binding site, promoter sequence, tenrinator sequence, antibiotic resistance
   gene, and a bacterial origin of replication (orl). Exemplary polynucleotides encoding
   albumin binding domains of the invention are shown in SEQ ID NO: 35.
            Another embodiment of the invention is a vector comprising at least one
   polynucleotide of the invention. Such vectors may be plasmid vectors, viral vectors,
30 vectors for baculovirus expression, transposon based vectors or any other vector suitable
   for introduction of the polynucleotides of the invention into a given organism or genetic
   background by any means. Such vectors may be expression vectors comprising nucleic
   acid sequence elements that can control, regulate, cause or permit expression of a
   polypeptide encoded by such a vector. Such elements may comprise transcriptional
35 enhancer binding sites, RNA polymerase initiation sites, ribosome binding sites, and other
                                                   14

   sites that facilitate the expression of encoded polypeptides in a given expression system.
   Such expression systems may be cell-based, or cell-free systems well known in the art.
   Host Cell Selection or Host Cell Engineering
             ABDCon and variants thereof of the present invention can be optionally produced
 5 by a cell line, a mixed cell line, an immortalized cell or clonal population of immortalized
   cells, as well known in the art. See, e.g., Ausubel, et aL, ed, Current Protocols in
   Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY, NY (1987-2001); Sambrook, et aL.

   selected from COS-1, COS-7, HEK293, BHK21, CHO, BSC-l, Hep G2, 653, SP2/0, HeLa,
15 myeloma, lymphoma, yeast, insect or plant cells, or any derivative, immortalized or
   transformed cell thereof. Alternatively, the host cell may be selected from a species or
   organism incapable of glycosylating polypeptides, e.g. a prokaryotic cell or organism,
   such as BL21, BL21 (DE3), BL2I-GOLD(DE3), XL I-Blue, JM 109, HMSI 74,
   HMS174(DE3), and any of the natural or engineered E. coi spp, Klebsiella spp, or
20 Pseudomonasspp strains.
   Uses of albumin binding domains of the invention
             The compositions of the non-natural albumin binding domain ABDCon and
   variants thereof of the invention can be used to modulate the halflife and/or
25 biodistribution of a bioactive agent within the tissue of an animal by operably linking
   ABDCon and the bioactive agent, and wherein the administration of the composition to an
   animal results in a half life and/or biodistribution of the bioactive agent which is different
   from the tissue distribution obtained upon administration of the active agent alone.
30 Pharmaceutical Compositions Comprising ABDCon or variants thereof
             The ABDCon or variants thereof binding albumin operably linked to bioactive
   agents can be isolated using separation procedures well known in the art for capture,
   immobilization, partitioning, or sedimentation, and purified to the extent necessary for
   commercial applicability.
                                                    15

             For therapeutic use, the bioactive molecule-ABDCon fusion proteins may be
   prepared as pharmaceutical compositions containing an effective amount of the bioactive
   agent-ABDCon fusion protein as an active ingredient in a pharmaceutically acceptable
   carrier. The term "carrier" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which
 5 the active compound is administered. Such vehicles can be liquids, such as water and oils,
   including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil,
   soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. For example, 0.4% saline and 0.3%
   glycine can be used. These solutions are sterile and generally free of particulate matter.
   They may be sterilized by conventional, well-known sterilization techniques (e.g.,
10 filtration). The compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary
   substances as required to approximate physiological conditions such as pH adjusting and
   buffering agents, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating and coloring agents, etc. The
   concentration of the bioactive agent-ABDCon fusion protein in such pharmaceutical
   formulation can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 0.5%, usually at or at least about
15 1%to as much as 15 or 20% by weight and will be selected primarily based on required
   dose, fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., according to the particular mode of administration
   selected. Suitable vehicles and fonnulations are described, for example, in e.g.

20 691-1092, See especially pp. 958-989.
             The mode of administration for therapeutic use of the bioactive agent-ABDCon
   fusion protein may be any suitable route that delivers the agent to the host, such as
   parenteral administration, e.g., intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous or
   subcutaneous, pulmonary; transmucosal (oral, intranasal, intravaginal, rectal); using a
25 formulation in a tablet, capsule, solution, suspension, powder, gel, particle; and contained
   in a syringe, an implanted device, osmotic pump, cartridge, micropump; or other means
   appreciated by the skilled artisan, as well known in the art. Site specific administration
   may be achieved by for example intrarticular, intrabronchial, intraabdominal,
   intracapsular, intracartilaginous, intracavitary, intracelial, intracerebellar,
30 intracerebroventricular, intracolic, intracervical, intragastric, intrahepatic, intracardial,

             While having described the invention in general terms, the embodiments of the
   invention will be further disclosed in the following examples that should not be construed
   as limiting the scope of the claims.
 5 EXAMPLE 1. Generation of non-natural albumin binding domain
   Design of non-natural albumin binding domain consensus (AEDCon)
             A non-natural albumin binding domain (ABD) was designed by calculating a
   consensus amino acid sequence of 3-helix bundle ADD sequences deposited in the non
   redundant protein database. In order to deternine the consensus sequence, the ABD from
10 Streptococcus sp. G148 protein G (SEQID NO: 1) was used as a template sequence for a
   BLAST search against the non-redundant NCBI protein database
   (http:_//blast_ncbi_nim nih gov/Blast egi). All default settings were used for the
   BLAST search; Expect threshold = 10, word size = 3, matrix = BLOSUM62, gap costs =
   existence 11, extension 1, and compositional adjustments = conditional compositional
15 score matrix adjustment. From this search, the 20 most closely related protein domains,
   listed in Table I (SEQ ID NOs: 1-20), were selected to be included in a multiple sequence
   alignment in order to determine a consensus. Only non-redundant sequences were
   selected. Several protein accession numbers are listed multiple times in Table 1,
   indicative that some proteins contain several closely related ABD domains. SEQ ID NO:4
20 is a non-natural ABD derived by phage display and gene shuffling. (He et aL, Protein Sci
    16::1490-1494, 2007).

             A multiple sequence alignment was generated from the sequences listed using
   AlignX software (using all default settings). The sequence alignment shown in Table 6
    was used to select the most prevalent amino acid at each sequence position to derive the
 5 albumin binding domain consensus sequence, ABDCon (SEQID NO: 21, Table 6). Tyr
   was chosen instead of Ile for position 21 as there was no clear consensus for this position
   and aromatic residues Tyr and Phe were well represented. Pairwise sequence identities
   between ABDCon range from 45% (SEQID NO: 3) to 82% (SEQID NOs: 8, 13, 14, and
   16).
10
   Gene Syntbesis
             The amino acid sequence of the albumin binding domain consensus (ABDCon)
   was back translated into a nucleic acid sequence encoding for ABDCon using preferred
   codons for E coli expression as below (SEQID NO: 35) and a synthetic gene produced
15 (BlueHeron Biotechnologies). 5' and 3' DNA sequences were added to the synthetic gene
   sequence of SEQID NO: 34 in order to add Ndel and Xbol sites for subeloning, as well as
   DNA sequences encoding for an N-terminal 8-His tag for protein purification. This gene
   was cloned into a pET26 vector (Novagen) for expression driven by a T7 promoter
   sequence and transformed into K coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen).
20
   Expression and Purification
             For expression of ABDcon, 50 mL of LB media supplemented with 30 pg/mL
   kanamycin was inoculated with I colony and grown overnight at 370 C, 220 rpm shaking.
   The next day, 10 mL of the overnight culture was added to 100 mL of Terrific Broth
25 supplemented with 30 ag/mL kanamycin and the culture grown at 37 0 C, 220 rpm for 2.5
   hours. IPTG was added to a final concentration of I mM and the temperature reduced to
   300 C to induce protein expression. Cells were harvested 14 hours later by centrifugation
   at 4000 X g for 20 minutes and the cell pellets stored at -20 0 C. Frozen cell pellets were
                                                   18

   resuspended in 5 mL of BugBuster HT (Novagen) per gram of wet pellet and gently mixed
   at room temperature for 30 minutes. The poly-histidine tagged ABDCon molecule was
   purified by Ni-NTA chromatography (GE Healthcare), eluting in a buffer of 50 mM
   sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 500 mM sodium chloride with a gradient of 10-250 mM
 5 imidazole. Fractions containing ABDCon were pooled and further purified by size
   exclusion chromatography using a Superdex75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) with a
   mobile phase of PBS. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 1). Mass
   spectrometry determined the mass to be 6383 Da, in agreement with the theoretical mass
   of 6382 Da (Figure 2). Analytical size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75
10 5/150 column (GE Healthcare) shows that the ABDCon preparation is free of aggregates
   and elutes at a time consistent with a monomeric protein (Figure 3).
   EXAMPLE 2. Characterization of ABDCon
   Thermal Stability of ABDCon
15           ABDCon was concentrated to 2.175 mg/mL in PBS pH 7.4 and the thermal
   stability assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Stability data was
   generating by heating 400 pL of the ABDCon solution from 25*C to 100*C at a scan rate
   of 1C per minute in a VP-DSC instrument (MicroCal). A second identical scan was
   completed on the sample in order to assess the reversibility of thermal folding/unfolding.
20 Data was fit to a 2-state unfolding model in order to calculate the melting temperature.
   Figure 4 shows that ABDCon has a high thermal stability of 81.5 0 C in PBS and that
   folding is fully reversible.
   ABDCon Binding to Albumin
25           The kinetics of ABDCon binding to human serum albumin and mouse serum
   albumin were measured on a ProteOnTm XPR-36 Protein Interaction Array System (Bio
   Rad) using GLC sensor chips. Human (SEQ ID NO: 36), Rhesus (SEQ ID NO: 37), and
   murine (SEQ ID NO: 38) serum albumins were purchased from Sigma (Catalogue #
   A4327 for human, #A3559 for murine, and #A4297 for rhesus) and resuspended in PBS at
30 different concentrations. Each serum albumin was directly immobilized on a ligand
   channel in the vertical orientation of a GLC chip via standard amine coupling at 2.1 pg/mL
   at pH 5.0 to obtain surfaces with ligand densities of 500-1000 resonance units. Binding of
   recombinant ABDCon was tested by flowing five different concentrations (e.g. I tM
   diluted in a 3-fold concentration series) as analytes simultaneously in the horizontal
35 orientation over the immobilized serum albumin surfaces. The dissociation phases for all
                                                  19

   concentrations were monitored for two hours at a flow rate of 100 tUmin using PBST
   (PBS, 0.005% Tween20) as running buffer. A sixth sample (buffer only) was injected to
   monitor the baseline stability. The surfaces were regenerated using I short pulse (18 PL)
   of 0.8% phosphoric acid.

   surface. Table 2 describes the binding kinetics determined for each species of albumin.
15 Serum half-life of ABDCon fusion in mice
           The ability of ABDCon to extend the serum half-life of a fusion protein was
   evaluated by producing a synthetic gene encoding a fusion of ABDCon to the c-terminus
   of Tencon25. Tencon25 is a protein scaffold based on a consensus sequence of a
   fibronectin type III (FN3) repeat protein having a sequence shown in residues 1-90 of SEQ
20 ID NO: 39, and described in US201 l1/0274623AI. Tencon25 and ABDCon protein
   domains were fused by a (G4S)2 peptide linker (SEQ ID NO: 40). The resulting fusion
   protein has a polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 39. A poly-histidine tag was
   incorporated at the C-terminus for purification purposes. Sixty nine BALB/c female mice
   were split into 3 groups (N=3 group I non-treated control, and N= 33 groups 2-3). Mice
25 were treated with a single intravenous dose of the Tencon25-ABDCon fusion protein at
   2mg/kg. The dosing was based upon the weight of the animals on the day of
   administration. The mice were euthanized at the following time points after the injection:
    Omin, 30min, 1, 4, 6, hours, and 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 14 days. Blood samples were taken from
   each animal via cardiac puncture. The blood samples were allowed to clot at room
30 temperature for 30 minutes, but no longer than I hor. The blood samples were then
                                                 20

   centrifuged at approximately 3,500 rpm for 15 minutes. Serum samples were analyzed
   using a homogenous sandwich ELISA on the Mesoscale Discovery platform.
   Streptavidin-Gold plates (Mesoscale Discovery) were blocked for I hour with Superblock
   (TBS) Tween-20 (Thermo). Polyclonal anti-Tencon25 antibody was used for both capture
 5 (biotinylated) and detection (labeled with MSD Sulfo-Tag (Mesoscale Discovery)) at
   0.625pg/ml. The antigen and antibodies were added to the plates, which were incubated
   for 2 hours with vigorous shaking at RT. Plates were washed with TBS-T (Sigma) and
   MSD Read Buffer with Surfactant (Mesoscale Discovery) was added. The plates were
   read using the MSD Sector Imager 6000. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism.
10 Previous studies have shown that a similar, unfused Tencon molecule is cleared from the
   bloodstream quickly with a serum half-life of approximately 20 minutes in mice. Fusion
   of Tencon25 to ABDCon extends the serum half-life to over 60 hours (Figure 5).
   EXAMPLE 3: Engineering of ABDCon for varying affinity to serum albumin
15          The affinity of binding to serum albumin can dictate not only the serum half-life
   of a therapeutic protein but also the ability of that molecule to bind and neutralize its
   target. For example, a molecule that binds serum albumin too weakly will have short
   serum half-life due to renal filtering while not bound to albumin (Hopp et al. Protein Eng
   Des Sel 23:827-834, 2010). On the contrary, a molecule that binds to albumin too tightly
20 will not be released from albumin at the preferred site of action and thus may be unable to
   neutralize the desired target in some cases. It is therefore preferable to achieve half-life
   extension via albumin binding in a way in which the albumin interaction is only tight
   enough to give the desired serum half-life. As the ABDCon sequence described herein
   binds to human serum albumin with an affinity of 75 pM and an off-rate of 3.02x1 ' /s
25 (under experimental conditions described herein), molecules fused to ABDCon will be
   largely bound to albumin once administered to an animal or patient. For some targets and
   fusions, it may be desirable to be bound less tightly to serum albumin. Ten mutant
   versions of ABDCon were designed to lower the binding affinity of ABDCon foralbumin.
   Table 3 summarizes these mutants:

            ABDCon mutants were selected by examining the crystal structure of the GA
   module (protein G-related albumin binding module) bound to human senrn albumin (PDB
 5 code ITFO) (Lejon et al., Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struet Biol Cryst Commnn              64:64-69,
   2008) and making the assumption that ABDCon binds to albumin in a manner very similar
   to GA. Mutants were designed to decrease the affinity ofABDCon for albumin by
   disrupting hydrophobic contacts, introducing steric clashing, disrupting salt bridges, and
   disrupting hydrogen bonding (Table 3). Changes introduced were designed to decrease
10 binding affinity without changing the binding surface so dramatically that binding was
   abolished. Each mutant was expressed and purified from E. coli as described for
   ABDCon. Mutant ABDConl I was found to be insoluble and thus excluded from further
   analysis. The affinities of each variant for human, mouse, and rhesus serum albumin were
   determined by surface plasma resonance and shown in Table 4. In addition to the
15 positions listed in Table 3, residues L25, E33, G34, L38, 142, and A45 may be mutated to
   increase or decrease the affinity of ABDCon for albumin as they are predicted to form
   direct contacts with albumin.

 5 EXAMPLE 4: Serum Half-life of ABDCon variant fusion proteins
             Tencon25 (amino acids 1-90 of SEQ ID NO: 39) was fused to ABDCon variants
   3, 5, 7, and 9 (Table 3) in order to assess the correlation between ABDCon affinity for
   albumin with half-life extension. These molecules were dosed into mice at 2 mg/kg as
   described above in previous studies and analyzed using identical methods as described for
10 the Tencon25-ABDCon fusions. A summary of the PK parameters obtained for these
   molecules is shown in Table 5 and Figure 6. Here it is demonstrated that the rate of
   clearance decreases as affinity for albumin is increased until reaching an affinity of 103
   nM at which point, no large differences in PK parameters are obtained. The data in Table
   5 demonstrate the ability to tune properties such as half-life, rate of clearance, and total
15 exposure (AUC) by varying the affinity of the ABDCon molecule for albumin.

   Example 5: Stabilization of albumin binding domains
            Studies were completed to determine the stability of ABDCon (SEQID NO: 21)
 5 when produced as fusion proteins with various fibronectin type III (FN3) domains (see, for
   example, U.S. Pat. Publ. No. US2010/0216708). The FN3 domain-ABDCon fusion
   proteins were generated using standard cloning techniques. The amino acid sequence of
   one of the fusion proteins, Tencon-ABDCon is shown in SEQ ID NO: 41. Other FN3
   domain-ABDCon fusion proteins made were Tencon25-ABDCon, 83-ABDCon and 71
10 ABDCon. These proteins were produced with c-terminal poly histidine tags and purified
   by a combination of nickel affinity and size exclusion chromatography using standard
   methods. Each purified molecule was incubated in PBS pH 7.4 at 37*C for 28 days before
   analysis by SDS-PAGE and Mass Spectrometry. Figure 7A demonstrates that each FN3
   domain-ABDCon fusion protein was found to be degraded during this incubation as
15 evidenced by the appearance of low molecular weight bands on the SDS-PAGE gel. Mass
   Spectrometry analysis confined that the main degradation pattern was clipping of these
   molecules at residues LI, K2, and E3 of the ABDCon sequence (SEQ ID NO: 21). In
   addition, it was observed that the native Streptococcus protein G ABD (SEQ ID NO: 1)
   fused to a FN3 domain displayed a similar degradation pattern with clipping at residue LI
20 when incubated at 4*C for 6-8 months (Data not shown). Finally, several purified lots of
   native ABD (SEQ ID NO: 1) and ABDCon (SEQID NO: 21) were observed to be inactive
   and undetectable in solution by SDS-PAGE once stored for several months at 4C,
   indicative of severe degradation.
            The above observations suggested that the N-teninal alpha helix of the ABDCon
25 and native ABD structures as used for serum half-life extension are unstable. This lack of
   stability for such fusion proteins is undesirable as it potentially limits the shelf-life of such
   molecules for research as well as therapeutic applications. As such, a strategy was
   developed to improve the stability of these molecules. Analysis of the three dimensional
   structures of albumin binding domains deposited in the Protein Data Bank shows that the
30 amino acid sequence TIDQWL (SEQ ID NO: 42) found N-terminal to the start of the
   native ABD (SEQ ID NO: 1) is structurally ordered as part of the first alpha helix of this
   molecule in several crystal structures (e.g. PDB 2VDB, Acta Cryst 2008 F64, 64-69). This
   is in contrast to the original NMR structure of the ABD which showed this region to be
   disordered in solution (PDB 1GAB, Johansson et al., j.Mo.Biol. 266: 859-865, 1997).
                                                  25

   Thus, it was hypothesized that extending this first alpha helix of the ABD and ABDCon
   sequences could impart greater stability to this region as extending alpha helices can
   impart greater stability to such a helix (Su et al., Biochemistry 33:15501-15510, 1994).
            A multiple sequence alignment of the natural albumin binding domains presented
 5 in Table I revealed no clear consensus sequence for these N-temninal residues. However
   one peptide sequence, TIDEWL (SEQ ID NO: 43), is present N-terminal to 5 of these
   protein domains. Thus, a new ABDCon construct, ABDCon 12 (SEQ ID NO: 44), was
   generated by adding the TIDEWL sequence to the N-terminus of ABDCon. This protein
   was expressed with an N-terminal poly histidine tag and purified to homogeneity using
10 standard methods for nickel affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography.
   Purified ABDConI 2 was incubated at 37*C in PBS for 28 days and stability assessed by
   SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. SDS-PAGE showed a slightly faster migration
   pattern after day 14 indicative of degradation. Total mass analysis however demonstrates
   that this degradation is occurring exclusively in the polyhistidine tag and not in the
15 ABDCon12 sequence, indicating that the TIDEWL sequence improved the stability of
   ABDCon. Further proof of stability was demonstrated in the stability of a generated FN3
   domain-ABDCon 12 fusion protein (Figure 7B) which showed significantly less
   degradation products compared to the original FN3 domain-ABDCon molecules (Figure
   7A) when incubated at 37*C in PBS for 28 days.
20           The melting temperature of ABDCon12 was determined by differential scanning
   calorimetry using the procedures outlined in Example 2 above in order to investigate the
   mechanism of stabilization for this molecule. A melting temperature of 90.9 0C was
   obtained in PBS, a 9.40 increase compared to the original ABDcon molecule, suggesting
   that the decrease in proteolysis/degradation observed for ABDConI 2 and ABDCon12
25 fusion proteins is a result of increased conformational stability afforded by the extension
   of the N-terminal alpha helix.

   Example 6: Characterization of ABDConI2
            The affinity of purified ABDCon12 binding to human and murine albumin was
   determined by surface plasmon resonance using the same methods as described above in
   Example 2. Dissociation constants of 0.7 nM and 8.2 nM were obtained for ABDCon12
10 binding to human and marine albumin, respectively. The ability of ABDConI 2 to extend
   the serum half-life of a fusion molecule was demonstrated by fusing ABDCon 12 to the C
   terminus of an FN3 domain specifically binding an antigen. This molecule was
   administered to mice by IP injection at 2 mg/kg and analyzed as described above in
   Example 4. A terminal half-life of 55 hours was measured for theFN3 domain
15 ABDCon12 fusion protein.
   Example 7: Stabilizing albumin binding domains
            Based on sequence analysis of naturally occurring albumin binding domains, it is
   anticipated that other sequences added to the N-terminus of albumin binding domains may
20 make them more stable. For example, a number of different sequences are found N
   terminal to these natural albumin binding domains such as but not limited to APAVDV
   (SEQ ID NO: 45), IAKEKA (SEQ ID NO: 46), TIDQWL (SEQ ID NO: 42), VPAADV
   (SEQ ID NO: 47), TVKSIE (SEQ ID NO: 48), TPAVDA (SEQ ID NO: 49), TLKSIK
   (SEQ ID NO: 50), WEKAAA (SEQ D NO: 5 1), AVDANS (SEQ ID NO: 52), QLAAEA
25 (SEQ ID NO: 53), ALKAAA (SEQ ID NO: 54), EKLAAA (SEQ ID NO: 55). Addition
   of these sequences to albumin binding domains might increase stability if these sequences
   produce longer alpha helices. In addition, non-natural peptides that increase alpha helix
   length or stability are predicted to stabilize albumin binding domains as well.
                     Variants with additional N-terminal sequences can be generated using
30 standard techniques and their properties tested as described supra.
            It will be clear that the invention can be practiced otherwise than as particularly
   described in the foregoing description and examples. Numerous modifications and
                                                   27

variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and,
therefore, are within the scope of the appended claims.
