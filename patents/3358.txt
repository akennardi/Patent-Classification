        The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a photovoltaic module
(10), comprising the following steps: forming, on an electrically conducting material, a
furrow (20A) defining a first (18A) and second (18B) lower electrode; then forming, on
each lower electrode, a stack (34) comprising at least one upper electrode (36) and an
intermediate photo-active layer (38), to form a first (16A) and second (16B) photovoltaic
cell, respectively; then forming an electrical connection (17A) between said cells (16A,

Method for manufacturing a photovoltaic module and photovoltaic module thus
                                  obtained
The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best
                method of performing it known to me/us:-

                                                   2
          The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a photovoltaic module,
 5 of the type comprising at least two electrically connected photovoltaic cells, the method
   comprising the following steps: providing an electrically insulating substrate covered with a
   layer of a first electrically conducting material; then forming, on said layer, at least one
   furrow defining first and second lower electrodes, electrically isolated from one another by
   said furrow; then forming, on each of said lower electrodes, a stack comprising at least: an
10 upper electrode formed by a layer of a second electrically conducting material; and a layer
   of a photo-active material positioned between the lower and upper electrodes, each of the
   first and second lower electrodes respectively forming a first and second photovoltaic cell
   with the corresponding stack; then forming an electrical connection between the upper
   electrode of the first photovoltaic cell and the second lower electrode.
15         A photovoltaic module is an electronic component which, exposed to light,
   produces electricity. Such a photovoltaic module typically comprises several electrically
   connected photovoltaic cells. Each cell includes at least one photo-active material, i.e.,
   able to produce electricity from light. Such a material is for example an organic
   semiconductor.
20         A photovoltaic module of the aforementioned type is described in document US
   7,932,124. Each cell of such a photovoltaic module is formed by a stack of strips,
   including a photo-active layer between two electrodes, said stack of strips being
   positioned on a substrate.
           Such a stack, called active area, is separated into adjacent active areas by a so
25 called inactive area. Said inactive area allows electric isolation of the lower electrodes of
   two adjacent cells while connecting the upper electrode of each cell to the lower electrode
   of an adjacent cell. A photovoltaic module is obtained by forming several cells thus
   connected in series.
           Generally, in large-scale production methods, the layers of stacks are made using
30 a wet method, i.e., by depositing a liquid formulation followed by a passage to the solid
   state.
           The performance of the photovoltaic module in particular involves producing the
   narrowest possible inactive areas, to maximize the size of the active areas. However, the
   rheological and wettability properties of the formulations, as well as the physical properties
35 of the substrates, impose minimum widths for the inactive areas. In particular, wet
   depositions cause edge effects on the strips.

                                                      3
           The layers of the stack forming each cell in document US 7,932,124 are in
   particular made with decreasing widths, so as to arrange a stair-stepped lateral offset.
   Such a production method makes it more complex to implement through large-scale
   production methods and contributes to decreasing the size of the active areas.
 5         The present invention aims to propose a method for manufacturing a photovoltaic
   module in particular making it possible to minimize the size of the inactive areas and to
   maximize that of the active areas.
           To    that   end, the     invention   relates    to   a  manufacturing   method   of   the
   aforementioned type, comprising the following steps, between the step for forming the
10 furrow and the stacking step: forming a first electrically insulating strip in the furrow and
   above said furrow, said strip forming a relief relative to the first and second lower
   electrodes; and forming a second electrically insulating strip on the second lower
   electrode, said first and second electrically insulating strips being substantially parallel and
   delimiting an inactive area on said second lower electrode. Furthermore, the stack formed
15 on the second photovoltaic cell is positioned outside the inactive area.
           According to other advantageous aspects of the invention, the method includes
   one or more of the following features, considered alone or according to all technically
   possible combinations:

   third electrically insulating strips.
25         - at least the first electrically insulating strip is formed by deposition, on the furrow
   and on the first electrically conducting material, of a first liquid formulation of insulating
   material, followed by a passage to the solid state of said first formulation;
           - the layer of the first electrically conducting material covering the substrate has a
   first surface energy; and the deposition of the first liquid formulation creates a first

   interface being lower than said first surface energy; a difference between said first surface
   energy and said first surface tension preferably being comprised between 0.015 N.m-1 and
   0.025 N.m-;
           - the step for forming an electrical connection comprises depositing a layer of a
35 third electrically conducting material between the upper electrode of the first photovoltaic

                                                     4
   cell and the second lower electrode of the second photovoltaic cell, above the first
   electrically insulating strip;
           - the first electrically insulating strip has a second surface energy; and the third
   layer of electrically conducting material is formed by depositing a second liquid
 5 formulation, creating a second interface with said first electrically insulating strip, a second
   surface tension of said second interface being lower than said second surface energy; a
   difference between said second surface energy and said second surface tension
   preferably being greater than 0.015 N.m- 1 ;
           - the first liquid formulation of insulating material comprises at least one polymer
10 and at least one surfactant, the at least one polymer preferably being prepared with a

           - at least one of the layers of second electrically conducting material and photo
   active material is formed by a coating or printing technique using a continuous wet

           - the step for forming an electrical connection is carried out at the same time as the
   deposition of the layer of the second electrically conducting material, the third electrically
   conducting material being identical to said second electrically conducting material.
20         - the upper electrode and the electrical connection are formed from an electrically
   conducting material transparent to visible light;
           - a thickness of the layer of third electrically conducting material is smaller than 1
   pm and preferably smaller than 600 nm.
           The invention further relates to a photovoltaic module derived from or able to be
25 derived from a method as described above.
           According to one advantageous aspect of the invention, said module is such that a
   ratio between the sum of areas of the stacks comprising a layer of photo-active material
   and a total area of the substrate is greater than 80%, and preferably greater than 85%.
           The invention will be better understood upon reading the following description,
30 provided solely as a non-limiting example and done in reference to the drawings, in which:
           -    figure 1 is a sectional schematic view of a photovoltaic module according to
                one embodiment of the invention;

                                                   5
            Figure 1 is a sectional view of a photovoltaic module 10 according to one
   embodiment of the invention.
            The photovoltaic module 10 in particular includes a substrate 12, formed by a film
   of electrically insulating material that is transparent to visible light, in particular of the
 5 polymer type. The substrate 12 in particular includes a substantially planar surface 14,
   delimited by at least one edge 15.
            An orthogonal base (X, Y, Z) is considered, the surface 14 forming a plane (X, Y).
            The photovoltaic module 10 includes at least two photovoltaic cells 16A, 16B, 16C,
   positioned on the substrate 12. The photovoltaic module 10 further includes at least one
10 electrical connection 17A, 17B between two photovoltaic cells.
            Each of the photovoltaic cells 16A, 16B, 16C is formed by the stack of coated
   strips longitudinally along the direction Y. The length of the strips along Y can reach up to
   several hundreds of meters.
            Preferably, the photovoltaic module 10 includes a plurality of photovoltaic cells
15 16A, 16B, 16C, for example a number of photovoltaic cells greater than three. The
   photovoltaic module 10 preferably includes four, nine or twenty photovoltaic cells in the
   form of strips, the number of cells not being restricted to these values.
            The photovoltaic cells 16A, 16B, 16C are substantially identical and adjacent along
   the direction X. The adjacent cells are connected by an electrical connection 17A, 17B.
20          A first photovoltaic cell 16A is adjacent along X to an edge 15 of the substrate 12.
   A second photovoltaic cell 16B is positioned between the first 16A and a third 16C
   photovoltaic cells. Said second cell 16B is electrically connected to each of said first 16A
   and third 16C cells, respectively by a first 17A and a second 17B electrical connection.
            The first 16A and second 16B photovoltaic cells will be described at the same time
25 below. The third photovoltaic cell 16C, partially shown in figure 1, is considered to be
   identical to the second photovoltaic cell 16B.
            Each photovoltaic cell 16A, 16B includes a lower electrode 18A, 18B in contact
   with the surface 14 of the substrate 12. The lower electrode 18A,18B is formed by a layer
   of a first electrically conducting material 19, transparent to visible light. For example, the
30 lower electrode 18A, 18B has a width along X comprised between 10 mm and 20 mm.
            Each lower electrode 18A, 18B is separated from the one or two adjacent lower
   electrodes by a furrow 20A, 20B extending along Y. For example, the first 18A and
   second 18B lower electrodes of the first 16A and second 16B photovoltaic cells are
   separated by the furrow 20A; the second lower electrode 18B is delimited along X by the
35 furrow 20A and 20B.

                                                     6
            A bottom of the furrow 20A, 20B is formed by the electrically insulating substrate
   12. Thus, each furrow 20A, 20B electrically insulates the lower electrodes situated on
   either side of said furrow.
            The lower electrodes 18A, 18B have a thickness along Z preferably smaller than 1
 5 pm. More preferably, said thickness is comprised between 50 and 500 nm.
            Each photovoltaic cell 16A, 16B further includes a first 22A, 22B and a second
   24A, 24B electrically insulating strip, extending along Y. Each of said electrically insulating
   strips forms a relief along Z relative to the lower electrodes 18A, 18B.
            Each first electrically insulating strip 22A, 22B extends in a furrow 20A, 20B and
10 above said furrow. Each second electrically insulating strip 24A, 24B extends away from
   the furrows 20A, 20B. Thus, each second electrically insulating strip 24A, 24B separates
   the corresponding lower electrode 18A, 18B into two areas 26A, 26B and 28A, 28B,
   adjacent along X.
            A first area 26A, 26B is called "active area" and a second area 28A, 28B is called
15 "inactive area". In figure 1, each of the active areas 26A and 26B of the first 16A and
   second 16B photovoltaic cells, respectively, is respectively comprised between the first
   strip 22A and the second strip 24A, and between the first strip 22B and the second strip
   24B.
            The inactive area 28B (figure 5) of the second photovoltaic cell 16B is comprised
20 between the first strip 22A, separating the first 16A and second 16B photovoltaic cells,
   and the second strip 24B. The inactive area 28A of the first photovoltaic cell 16A is
   comprised between the edge 15 of the substrate 12 and the second strip 24A.
            A width 30 along X of the active area 26A, 26B (figure 5) is larger than a width 32
   along X of the inactive area 28A, 28B. Preferably, the width 32 of the inactive area 28B of
25 the second photovoltaic cell 16B is comprised between 0.1 mm and 2.0 mm, more
   preferably comprised between 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm. Preferably, the widths 30 of the active
   areas 26A and 26B of the photovoltaic cells 16A and 16B are comprised between 10 mm
   and 15 mm, more preferably comprised between 11 mm and 14 mm.
            For information, a width 33 (figure 2) along X of each electrically insulating strip
30 22A, 22B, 24A, 24B is comprised between 0.2 m and 1 mm.
            At the active area 26A, 26B, each photovoltaic cell 16A, 16B includes a stack 34 of
   layers of materials. The stack 34, or active area, comprises at least an upper electrode 36
   and a photo-active layer 38.
            The upper electrode 36 is formed by a layer of a second electrically conducting
35 material 40, in particular made from metal, preferably transparent to visible light. It for
   example involves an ink with a base of silver nanoparticles or silver nanowires.

                                                   7
            The photo-active layer 38, positioned between the lower 18A, 18B and upper 36
   electrodes, is made up of a photo-active material 42. The photo-active material 42 is semi
   conductive. It is preferably an organic semiconductor. Advantageously, the photo-active
   material 42 is made up of a mixture of an electron donor material, called p material, and
 5 an electron acceptor material, called n material. The photo-active material 42 is for
   example a close mixture, on a nanometric scale, of said p and n materials. Alternatively,
   the photo-active layer 38 can be a heterojunction of a p material and a n material, in the
   form of a layer or a stack of several layers.
            In the embodiment of figure 1, the active area 34 further includes a first 44 and
10 second 46 interface layer, playing an electron transport role or serving as vias between
   the electrodes 18A, 18B, 36 and the photo-active layer 38. Each interface layer 44, 46 is
   positioned between said photo-active layer 38 and one of the lower 18A, 18B or upper 36
   electrodes.
            Each of the different layers of the active area 34 preferably has a thickness along
15 Z of less than 5 pm, more preferably less than 1 pm.
            The geometric fill factor (GFF) of the photovoltaic module 10 is considered. The
   GFF is defined as a ratio between the sum of the areas of the active areas 34 of the
   photovoltaic cells 16A, 16B, 16C and a total area of the substrate 12. The higher the GFF
   is, the better the electrical performance of the photovoltaic module 10 is.
20          Obtaining a high GFF in particular requires mastering the geometry of the electrical
   connections 17A, 17B, as described below.
            The first electrical connection 17A connects the upper electrode 36 of the first
   photovoltaic cell 16A and the second lower electrode 18B. Figure 2 shows a detail view of
   the photovoltaic module 10, at said first electrical connection 17A.
25          The first electrical connection 17A is formed by a layer of a third electrically
   conducting material 52. Said layer is positioned above the first electrically insulating strip
   22A and electrically connects the upper electrode 36 of the first photovoltaic cell 16A to
   the inactive area 28B of the second lower electrode 18B.
            Preferably, a thickness 54 of said layer of the material 52 is substantially
30 homogenous along the level difference formed by the first electrically insulating strip 22A.
   Indeed, an overly variable thickness may cause an interruption in the electrical
   connectivity between two adjacent cells.
            Preferably, said thickness 54 is smaller than 5 pm, more preferably smaller than 1
   pm and still more preferably smaller than 600 nm.
35          Preferably, the third electrically conducting material 52 is substantially identical to
   the second electrically conducting material 40.

                                                   8
           The second electrical connection 17B is positioned similarly to the first electrical
   connection 17A, between the second 16B and third 16C photovoltaic cells.
           A method for manufacturing the photovoltaic module 10 above will now be
   described, based on figures 3 to 6.
 5         First (figure 3), the substrate 12 is provided covered with a layer of the first
   electrically conducting material 19. Said material 19 is for example deposited on the
   surface 14 of the substrate 12 by coating of the solid surface type.
           The furrows 20A, 20B are next formed on said layer of material 19 (figure 4), in
   particular by mechanical or laser etching. Said furrows define the lower electrodes 18A,
10 18B electrically insulated from one another.
           The first 22A, 22B and second 24A, 24B electrically insulating strips are next
   formed (figure 5) on said lower electrodes 18A, 18B, defining the active areas 26A, 26B
   and the inactive areas 28A, 28B. As will be described later, the electrically insulating strips
   are formed by depositing a liquid formulation of insulating material, followed by a passage
15 to the solid state of said formulation.
           Each of the first 22A, 22B electrically insulating strips makes it possible to
   complete the electrical insulation between the adjacent photovoltaic cells. Indeed, the
   formation of an electrically insulating strip in a furrow 20A, 20B makes it possible to
   minimize any short-circuits between the adjacent lower electrodes 18A, 18B. Such short
20 circuits are in particular caused by debris generated during the formation of the furrow by
   etching.
           A stack 34 of layers of materials is next produced (figure 6) at the active area 26A,
   26B of each lower electrode 18A, 18B. Each layer can be formed owing to a wide range of
   techniques. The manufacturing methods compatible with large-scale production are
25 preferably continuous methods, such as the scrolling or roll-to-roll methods.
           Wet scrolling methods, i.e., deposition in the liquid state, are divided into several
   categories: printing methods make it possible to create high-resolution patterns; coating
   methods comprise depositing material over the entire width or entire surface, with no
   pattern.
30         Printing methods in particular comprise flexography, heliography, photogravure,
   offset printing, serigraphy and inkjet printing. Coating methods in particular comprise slot
   die, curtain coating, and knife coating.
           Each of the different layers 36, 38, 44, 46 of the stacks 34 is preferably formed by
   a wet scrolling coating or printing technique, in particular chosen from among slot-die,
35 photogravure, serigraphy and flexography.

                                                   9
            The electrically insulating strips form a physical border between the active and
   inactive areas of each lower electrode. This border facilitates the formation of stacks 34 by
   successive layers, by controlling the definition of the edges of said layers. In particular, the
   presence of the electrically insulating strips makes it possible to avoid the lateral offset of
 5 the layers, in a stair-stepped manner, as described in document US 7,932,124.
            In the case of printing or coating by machines comprising driving rollers, such as
   for flexography, heliography, photogravure, serigraphy and slot-die, the electrically
   insulating strips also form a physical protection along the axis the of the coated surface.
   Such a protection makes it possible to limit the formation of defects on the various coated
10 layers, by the contact between the driving rollers and the substrate to be coated.
            The various photovoltaic cells 16A, 16B, 16C are thus obtained. Said photovoltaic
   cells are electrically isolated from one another, as shown in figure 6.
            A final step of the manufacturing method comprises forming electrical connections
   17A, 17B, by depositing a layer of the third electrically conducting material 52 above the
15 first electrically insulating strips 22A, 22B.
            The photovoltaic module 10 of figure 1 is thus obtained.
            Preferably, the formation of the electrical connections 17A, 17B and the deposition
   of the layer 36 are done at the same time. In this case, the third electrically conducting
   material 52 is identical to the second electrically conducting material 40. Preferably, a
20 thickness 54 of said third material is then substantially identical to the thickness of the
   layer 36.
            The third electrically conducting material 52 is preferably obtained by a wet
   scrolling coating or printing technique, i.e., by depositing a liquid formulation, followed by a
   passage to the solid state of said formulation. During this step, it is desirable to obtain the
25 smallest possible thickness 54, in particular of about 1 pm, to minimize the wet contact of
   said formulation with the layer previously deposited. Indeed, such contact may lead to the
   re-dissolution of the lower layers and the diffusion of the solvents and materials through
   the lower layers. This results in stray resistances and electrical short-circuits.
            Furthermore, a small thickness 54 makes it possible to limit the edge effects with
30 the first 22A and second 24B electrically insulating strips, during wet coating of the
   electrical connection 17A. It is thus possible to minimize the width 32 of the inactive areas
   28B of the photovoltaic cells, which leads to an optimization of the GFF.
            Furthermore, as previously indicated, it is desirable to obtain a homogeneous
   thickness 54 at the level difference generated by the insulating strip in order to ensure the
35 continuity of the electrical conductivity. Yet the traditional scrolling deposition methods

                                                 10
   such as slot-die, heliogravure or flexography are often unsuitable for obtaining a
   homogeneous thickness of the non-planar surfaces, such as the insulating strips.
            Gaseous-phase coating methods, such as chemical or physical evaporation
   deposition methods, are known to make it possible to obtain a layer with a homogeneous
 5 thickness on nonplanar surfaces. Such methods are, however, not very compatible with
   the industrial production of photovoltaic modules having large surface areas, in particular
   since they generate too many material losses.
            Serigraphy methods, which make it possible to coat inks with a base of silver metal
   particles, are also known. However, the homogeneity is established by coated thicknesses
10 generally exceeding 5 pm, which is too high relative to the targeted thicknesses 54.
            According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the method for forming
   the layer of the third electrically conducting material 52 makes it possible to verify the
   value and the homogeneity of the thickness 54. Said method involves mastering the
   surface tensions of the various formulations deposited in the liquid state.
15          The surface tension is defined as the energy necessary to modify the form of an
   interface established between the molecules of a first liquid and those of a second liquid
   or of a gaseous substance that is insoluble in the first liquid. The surface tension is
   measured in newtons per meter (N.m1 ). The surface tension of a liquid on a solid
   substrate, or surface tension, can be measured using a tensiometer or goniometer. The
20 tension is determined using an ideal probe, allowing perfect wetting irrespective of the
   studied liquids, said probe being suspended from a precision scale.
            The absence of mobility of the molecules of a solid does not make it possible, like
   for a liquid, to determine its surface tension directly. The surface tension of a solid, or
   surface energy, can be measured indirectly by measuring the contact angles with different
25 reference liquids. The contact angles make it possible to model the angle formed, with a
   given surface, by a drop of three standard pure liquids having a dispersive part and a
   polar part. The usable reference liquids are in particular thiodiglycol, ethylene glycol and
   diiodomethane.
            According to the preferred embodiment of the method previously described, the
30 first insulating strip 22A is produced by coating, with the first liquid formulation, insulating
   materials on the lower electrodes 18A, 18B and the furrow 20A, followed by drying. The
   first formulation for example comprises polymers prepared from materials such as amines,
   acrylates, epoxides, urethanes, phenoxys or combinations thereof. These insulating
   materials are deposited in solution, or without solvent when they are in liquid state at
35 ambient temperature.

                                                     11
            The layer of the first electrically conducting material 19 covering the substrate 12
   has a first surface energy 7s1. The deposition of the first liquid formulation creates a first
   interface 60 (figure 2) with said first material 19. Said first interface has a first surface
   tension Ts1, lower than said first surface energy ys1. Preferably, a difference between said
 5 first surface tension Ts1 and said first surface energy 7s1 is comprised between 0.015 N.m
   1 and 0.025 N.m-1.
            The first formulation is then solidified by thermal drying to form the first insulating
   strip 22A. In the solid state, said first strip has a second surface energy Ys2.
            After producing the stack or active area 34, the third electrically conductive
10 material 52 is deposited in the form of a second liquid formulation. Said second liquid
   formulation includes at least one conducting material, which may be chosen from among:
   electrically conducting metals and alloys, in particular gold, silver, copper, aluminum,
   nickel, palladium, platinum and titanium; conducting polymers such as polythiophenes,
   polyanilines, polypyrroles; and metal oxides such as indium and tin oxide, fluorinated tin
15 oxide, tin oxide and zinc oxide.
            The deposition of the second liquid formulation creates a second interface 62 with
   the first insulating strip 22A. A second surface tension Ts2 of said second interface is lower
   than the second surface energy 7S2. Preferably, a difference between said second surface
   energy    7S2 and said second surface tension Ts 2 is greater than 0.015 N.m-1
20          The second formulation is then solidified by thermal drying to form the first
   electrical connection 17A, in the form of a layer of material 52.
            The maintenance of the surface energies ys1, 7S2 and surface tensions Ts1 , Ts 2 in
   the ranges described above can be obtained by incorporating at least one additive of the
   surfactant type into the first liquid formulation of insulating materials. The choice of the
25 surfactant is determined by its ability to reduce the surface tension Ts1 of the first liquid
   formulation without decreasing the surface energy TS2 of the solid strip formed after drying.
            The surfactant-type additive is preferably a fluorinated surfactant, and more
   preferably an ethoxylated non-ionic fluorinated surfactant agent.
            Keeping the surface energies Ys1, 7S2 and surface tensions Ts1 , Ts 2 in the ranges
30 described above makes it possible to obtain a substantially homogeneous thickness 54
   less than or equal to 1 pm. The preferred embodiment described above in particular
   makes it possible to minimize the width 32 of the inactive areas 28B of the photovoltaic
   cells. A GFF greater than 80%, or even greater than 85%, can in particular be obtained for
   the photovoltaic module 10.

   example 2 below.
           Example 2: formation of the first insulating strip 17A
           A second liquid formulation is obtained to produce the first electrical connection
10 17A. The second liquid formulation comprises a conducting material of the silver-based
   ink type.
           A layer of second liquid formulation is next coated on each of the insulating strips
   E, F, G and H. Coating of the second liquid formulation is done with the automatic film
   applicator (AAF) by Erichsen. The deposited volume and the slots vary based on the tests
15 (tested slots 12.5 pm and 50 pm).
           The second surface tension TS2 of the second liquid formulation is measured on

            Conclusion
            The first surface tensions Ts1 of formulations G and H are not comprised between
   the values (7s1 - 25 mN/m) and (,s1 - 15 mN/m). Likewise, the second surface energies Ys2
   of insulating strips G and H are below the value (Ts 2  + 15 mN/m).
 5          Formulations G and H and the insulating strips derived from these formulations
   respectively have excessively low surface tensions and surface energies. The formation of
   the electrical connection 17A on an insulating strip 22A derived from formulations G and H
   leads to poor homogeneity of the layer of conducting material 52, which can cause a
   break in the electrical connection between the photovoltaic cells 16A and 16B.
10          Experimentally, the electrical resistance measured on the electrodes 36, 18B, on
   either side of the insulating strip 22A covered by the electrical connection 17A, is greater
   than 100 0. This resistance causes a loss of the electrical connection between the two
   cells 16A and 16B. The photovoltaic module 10 thus obtained is therefore not functional.
            On the contrary, formulations E and F and the insulating strips derived from these
15 formulations respectively have surface tensions and surface energies in the desired
   range. The formation of the electrical connection 17A on an insulating strip 22A derived
   from formulations E and F leads to a homogeneous layer of conducting material 52,
   therefore a good electrical connection between the photovoltaic cells 16A and 16B. The
   photovoltaic module 10 thus obtained is functional.
