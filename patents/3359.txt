    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
    1.       Field of the invention
    The present invention relates to a method for treating ocular inflammatory
    diseases in a subject in need of such treatment, which comprises administering
15  a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of
    at least one agonist of Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2).
    2.      Summary of the related art
    The formyl peptide receptor (FPR) family is involved in host defense against
    pathogens, but also in sensing internal molecules that may provide signals of
20  cellular dysfunction. This family includes 3 members in humans and one
    member of this family FPR2 (also known as FPRL-1, ALXA4) is a G protein
    coupled receptor that is expressed predominantly on inflammatory cells such
    as monocytes and neutrophils, as well as on T cells and has been shown to
    play a critical role in leukocyte trafficking during inflammation and human
25  pathology (Chiang N, Serhan CN, Dahlen, S, Drazen JM, Hay DWP, Rovati E,
    Shimizu T, Yokomizo T, Brink, C. The lipoxin receptor ALX: Potent ligand
    specific and stereoselective actions in vivo. Pharmacological Reviews 2006;
    58: 463-519). FPR2 is an exceptionally promiscuous receptor that responds to
    a large array of exogenous and endogenous ligands, including serum amyloid
30  A (SAA), chemokine variant sCKp8-1, the neuroprotective peptide humanin,
    anti-inflammatory eicosanoid lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and glucocotricoid-modulated
    protein annexin Al (Chiang N, Serhan CN, Dahlen, S, Drazen JM, Hay DWP,

    ligand-specific and stereoselective actions in vivo. Pharmacological Reviews
    2006; 58: 463-519). FPR2 transduces anti-inflammatory effects of LXA4 in
    many systems, and has been shown to play a key role in the resolution of
 5  inflammation (Dufton N, Perretti M. Therapeutic anti-inflammatory potential of
    formyl peptide receptor agonists. Pharmacology & Therapeutics 2010; 127:
    175-188). FPR2 knockout mice show exaggerated inflammation in disease
    conditions as expected by the biological role of the receptor (Dufton N, Hannon
    R, Brancaleone V, Dalli J, Patel HB, Gray M, D'Aquisto F, Buckingham JC,

    receptor 2: Ligand-specific effects on leukocyte responses and experimental
    inflammation. Journal of Immunology 2010; 184: 2611-2619).
    Activation of FPR2 by lipoxin A4 or its analogs and by Annexin I protein has
    been shown to result in anti-inflammatory activity by promoting active resolution
15  of inflammation which involves inhibition of polymorphonuclear neutrophils
    (PMNs) and eosinophils migration and also stimulate monocyte migration
    enabling clearance of apoptotic cells from the site of inflammation in a
    nonphlogistic manner (Maderna P, Cottell DC, Toivonen T, Dufton N, Dalli J,

20  critical for lipoxin A4 and annexin-derived peptide-stimulated phagocytosis.

    Implications for phagocytosis of apoptotic leukocytes. Journal of Immunology
    2006; 176: 1878-1888). In addition, FPR2 has been shown to inhibit NK
25  cytotoxicity and promote activation of T cells which further contributes to down
    regulation of tissue damaging inflammatory signals. FPR2/ LXA4 interaction
    has been shown to be beneficial in experimental models of ischemia
    reperfusion, angiogenesis, ocular inflammation such as endotoxin-induced
    uveitis, and corneal wound healing (Serhan C. Resolution phase of

10  and their role in wound healing. Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential
    fatty Acids. 2005; 73: 221-229). Pharmaceutical utility of lipoxin A4 and its
    analogs are hampered by inherent physicochemical properties of the natural
    poly-olefinic natural product. Therefore, small molecule anti-inflammatory
    agonists of FPR2 would have a wide variety of therapeutic benefit in
15  inflammatory disorders especially in the eye. Targeting FPR2 selectively would
    also have benefits of reduced side effects as compared to more broad acting
    anti-inflammatories such as steroids or NSAIDs which have significant side
    effects of elevated lOP and delays in wound healing in the eye. FPR2 is also
    expressed in ocular tissues in the cornea and also the posterior of eye, in
20  addition to the inflammatory cells that migrate into the ocular tissues. FPR2
    thus represents an important novel pro-resolutionary molecular target for the
    development of new therapeutic agents in ocular diseases with excessive
    inflammatory responses.
25  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
           The invention pertains to the ability of FPR2 agonists to exhibit ocular anti
      inflammatory activity with chemical stability and suitable for ocular delivery.

    invention, or any combination thereof, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts,
    hydrates, solvates, crystal forms and individual isomers, enantiomers, and
    diastereisomers thereof.
10           The actual amount of the compound to be administered in any given
    case will be determined by a physician taking into account the relevant
    circumstances, such as the severity of the condition, the age and weight of the
    patient, the patient's general physical condition, the cause of the condition, and
    the route of administration.
15           The patient will be administered the compound orally in any acceptable
    form, such as a tablet, liquid, capsule, powder and the like, or other routes may
    be desirable or necessary, particularly if the patient suffers from nausea. Such
    other     routes  may    include, without   exception,   transdermal,    parenteral,
    subcutaneous, intranasal, via an implant stent, intrathecal, intravitreal, topical to
20  the eye, back to the eye, intramuscular, intravenous, and intrarectal modes of
    delivery. Additionally, the formulations may be designed to delay release of the
    active compound over a given period of time, or to carefully control the amount
    of drug released at a given time during the course of therapy.

25  physiological saline solution as a major vehicle. The pH of such ophthalmic
    solutions should preferably be maintained between 4.5 and 8.0 with an
    appropriate buffer system, a neutral pH being preferred but not essential. The
    formulations may also contain conventional pharmaceutically acceptable
    preservatives, stabilizers and surfactants.
30  Preferred preservatives that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions
    of the present invention include, but are not limited to, benzalkonium chloride,
    chlorobutanol, thimerosal, phenylmercuric acetate and phenylmercuric nitrate.

    A preferred surfactant is, for example, Tween 80. Likewise, various preferred
    vehicles may be used in the ophthalmic preparations of the present invention.
    These vehicles include, but are not limited to, polyvinyl alcohol, povidone,
    hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, poloxamers, carboxymethyl cellulose,
 5  hydroxyethyl cellulose cyclodextrin and purified water.
    Tonicity adjustors may be added as needed or convenient. They include, but
    are not limited to, salts, particularly sodium chloride, potassium chloride,
    mannitol and glycerin, or any other suitable ophthalmically acceptable tonicity
10  adjustor.
    Various buffers and means for adjusting pH may be used so long as the
    resulting preparation is ophthalmically acceptable. Accordingly, buffers include
    acetate buffers, citrate buffers, phosphate buffers and borate buffers. Acids or
    bases may be used to adjust the pH of these formulations as needed.
15  In a similar manner an ophthalmically acceptable antioxidant for use in the
    present invention includes, but is not limited to, sodium metabisulfite, sodium
    thiosulfate, acetylcysteine, butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated
    hydroxytoluene.
    Other excipient components which may be included in the ophthalmic
20  preparations are chelating agents. The preferred chelating agent is edentate
    disodium, although other chelating agents may also be used in place of or in

    The actual dose of the active compounds of the present invention depends on
 5  the specific compound, and on the condition to be treated; the selection of the
    appropriate dose is well within the knowledge of the skilled artisan.
    The ophthalmic formulations of the present invention are conveniently
    packaged in forms suitable for metered application, such as in containers
    equipped with a dropper, to facilitate application to the eye. Containers suitable
10  for dropwise application are usually made of suitable inert, non-toxic plastic
    material, and generally contain between about 0.5 and about 15 ml solution.
    One package may contain one or more unit doses. Especially preservative-free
    solutions are often formulated in non-resealable containers containing up to
    about ten, preferably up to about five units doses, where a typical unit dose is
15  from one to about 8 drops, preferably one to about 3 drops. The volume of one
    drop usually is about 20-35 pl.
            The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile
    injectable suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to known
20  methods using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents.
    The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or
    suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for
    example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Sterile, fixed oils are conventionally
    employed as a solvent or suspending medium.              For this purpose any bland
25  fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides, fatty acids
    (including oleic acid), naturally occurring vegetable oils like sesame oil, coconut
    oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, etc., or synthetic fatty vehicles like ethyl oleate or
    the like. Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants, and the like can be incorporated
    as required.
30          The compounds of the invention may also be administered in the form of
    suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions may be
    prepared by mixing the invention compounds with a suitable non-irritating

            Since individual subjects may present a wide variation in severity of
 5  symptoms and each drug has its unique therapeutic characteristics, the precise
    mode of administration and dosage employed for each subject is left to the
    discretion of the practitioner.
            The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions described herein are
    useful as medicaments in mammals, including humans, for treatment of
10  diseases and/or alleviations of conditions which are responsive to treatment by
    agonists or functional antagonists of FPR2. Thus, in further embodiments of
    the invention, there are provided methods for treating a disorder associated
    with modulation of FPR2. Such methods can be performed, for example, by
    administering to a subject in need thereof a pharmaceutical composition
15  containing a therapeutically effective amount of at least one invention
    compound. As used herein, the term "therapeutically effective amount" means
    the amount of the pharmaceutical composition that will elicit the biological or
    medical response of a subject in need thereof that is being sought by the
    researcher, veterinarian,      medical  doctor   or other  clinician.    In  some
20  embodiments,      the subject in need       thereof is a mammal.         In some
    embodiments, the mammal is human.
    Materials and Methods
25         FPR2 agonists would be expected to have significant effects in many
     different types of ocular inflammation,        but have been      exemplified by
     demonstrating anti-inflammatory activity in endotoxin-induced uveitis in rats
     (Figures 1 and 2).         Anti-inflammatory activity in this model has been
     exemplified with the FPR2 agonists described in Table 4.

     Endotoxin-induced       uveitis    in  rats:   Uveitis   is   a   harmful     ocular
10   inflammatory condition in humans. Anterior               uveitis is a recurrent
     inflammatory disease and may have potentially blinding consequence.
     The pathogenesis of the disease is poorly understood, and the anti
     inflammatory therapy used is non-specific and is associated with
     significant complications. Animal models are key to understanding the
15   disease     and    testing   novel    therapies.    A    single    low     dose   of
     lipopolysaccaride (LPS) in the footpad induces anterior uveitis in rats.
     This model known as endotoxin-induced uveitis serves as a useful
     paradigm of human anterior uveitis. Male Lewis rats (260  25 grams)
     were purchased from Charles River Laboratory. Rats were footpad
20   injected (hind left side) with 100 pl of 1 mg/ml LPS (List Biological Labs)
     solution (in sterile 0.9% saline). Test compounds were formulated in the

    subcutaneously (10mg/kg) dosed 2 hr after LPS. Animals were sacrificed

    Alkali burn in rabbits: Corneal epithelium plays an important role in the
    maintenance of corneal function and           integrity. Prolonged corneal
    epithelial defects causes corneal opacity, neovascularization, bacterial
10  infection and visual loss. Corneal epithelial healing is a complex process
    involving inflammatory response to injury, cell proliferation and migration.
    Animal models of corneal injury are every useful to test new anti
    inflammatory and pro-wound healing therapies.           New Zealand White
    rabbits weighing between 2.1 and 2.5 kg were anesthetized systemically
15  with Ketamine/Xylazine (35/5 mg/kg) subcutaneously and topically with
    proparacaine (0.5%).       The corneal epithelial wound in one eye was
    induced with a NaOH saturated filter paper containing 1.0 N NaOH for
    30 seconds. The eyes were rinsed with sterile PBS. The corneal wound
    was confirmed by fluorescein staining with 10% sodium fluorescein
20  (Science Lab Com) and slit lamp photography. Test compounds were
    formulated in the vehicle described above. For initial studies compounds
    were topically dosed three times a day. Quantification of corneal wound
    areas was done using Image J software where fluorescing stain green
    part was traced and converted to total pixel.

     many different types of ocular inflammation, but have been exemplified by
     demonstrating anti-inflammatory activity in endotoxin-induced uveitis in rats
     (Figures 1 and        2).   Anti-inflammatory activity in this model has been
     exemplified with the following FPR2 agonists:
30        In this model the compounds show a strong anti-inflammatory activity in
     blocking the infiltration of neutrophils and protein into the anterior chamber. In
     addition FPR2 agonists show accelerated healing and re-epithelialization in
