TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001] The present invention relates to an impact energy dissipating device. In a particular form the
present invention relates to an impact energy dissipating device for attachment to any one of or more
externally directed portions of a child restraint for a vehicle.
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
[0002] The following publications are referred to in the present application and their contents are hereby
incorporated by reference in their entirety:
         International Patent Application No. PCT/AU2010/001495 (WO/2011/054063) titled "CHILD
SEAT WITH IMPACT PROTECTION" in the name of Britax Childcare Pty Ltd.
BACKGROUND
[0003] In any vehicular crash, a major source of injury to the occupant is contact with any intruding
objects such as the vehicle door interior, or projectiles such as glass or metal shards. When a vehicle is hit
from the front or rear, risk from intruding objects is minimised and the front or rear of the vehicle and
vehicle frame create a large crumple zone between intruding objects and the occupant. When a vehicle is
hit from the side however, this crumple zone is minimal, consequently posing the most frequent and
severe threat to occupant safety.
[0004] Child safety seats, also known as child restraints, are used to provide additional protection to an
occupant in the event of a vehicular crash, and generally comprise a rigid seat body comprising a base
portion, a back portion, a headrest and side wing portions. While the rigid side wing portions provide a
means of protecting the child in the event of a side impact crash from projectiles such as glass or metal
shards, their rigidity means that the majority of the impact energy from the side impact crash transfers to
the occupant of the seat.
[0005] Attempts to reduce the impact energy transferred to the occupant have been made by applying
impact absorbing mechanisms to child seats, such as the solutions described in International Patent
Application No. PCT/AU2010/001495. Figures 1OA and 10B show a schematic of an existing solution
including a side impact energy absorbing mechanism. The mechanism has a hollow shell with long,
generally flat outer and inner surfaces. Figure 1OA shows the seat before a side impact, and Figure 10B
shows the seat during an impact with a vehicle door interior. The long and flat surfaces offer little

                                                      2
resistance to the impact force, and the energy absorbing device collapses readily, resulting in a small
reduction in the impact force being transferred to the occupant.
[0006] It is against this background and the problems and difficulties associated therewith that the
present invention has been developed.
SUMMARY

comprising a seat body and first and second side wings depending from the seat body, the first and
second side wings each comprising an outwardly facing exterior surface, an impact energy absorbing
device depending from at least a part of the exterior surface of the first and second side wings, the impact
energy absorbing device comprising a hollow and/or gas, liquid, gel or other energy absorbing material
filled shell of deformable material formed by blow moulding, comprising an outwardly facing surface and
an inwardly or occupant facing surface, and a plurality of energy absorbing elements in the form of
recesses extending into the shell from the inwardly facing surface toward the outwardly facing surface,
wherein the impact absorbing system is adapted to absorb impact through a combination of the shell
plastically or elastically deforming, cushioning, rupturing, deflating or bursting, and the plurality of
energy absorbing elements cooperatively plastically or elastically deforming, cushioning or crushing, as a
result of the impact.

[0013] In one form, the shell features apertures so that some of any air in the shell can be released in a
controlled fashion as the device is compressed as a result of the impact.
[0014] According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an impact energy
absorbing device comprising a shell with a pair of opposing surfaces, wherein one of the surfaces
comprises at least one energy absorbing element in the form of a recess extending into the shell toward
the other surface.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0036] Referring now to Figure 1, there is shown a child safety seat 1 according to an embodiment. The
seat 1 comprising a rigid seat body 2 with first and second side wings 3, 4, depending from the seat body
2, the side wings each comprising an outwardly facing exterior surface 5 and an edge defining lip 6. The
child safety seat 1 further comprises an impact energy absorbing device 10 depending from the exterior
surface 5 of each of the side wings 3, 4.
[0037] Referring now to Figures 2 to 6, where there is shown the impact energy absorbing device 10,
according to an embodiment. The device 10 comprises a shell 11 of deformable material, having an
outwardly facing surface 12 and an inwardly or occupant facing surface 13. The device 10 further
comprises a plurality of energy absorbing elements 14 in the form of recesses extending into the shell 11
from the inwardly facing surface 13 toward the outwardly facing surface 12.
[0038] The shell 11 may be hollow and/or filled with a gas, liquid, gel or other energy absorbing
material.
[0039] The device 10 may be manufactured by blow moulding, and may be made from a polymer such
as low density polyethylene. The device 10 may also be moulded in 2 pieces and then assembled.
[0040] The inwardly facing surface 13 of the device 10 is configured to bear against the outwardly
facing exterior surface 5 of the side wing 3 and features a portion 15 configured to nest within the edge
defining lip 6 of the side wing 3. The device 10 is preferably attached to the side wing 3 by means of

                                                        5
screws applied via attachment holes 16. Attachment means need not be so limited, and may be by any
suitable means, such as by fixed attachment means such as adhesives or none-way bolts, or by removable
attachment means such as screws, clips, slide mounts or the like.
[0041] The impact energy absorbing device 10 is adapted to absorb impact force through a combination
of the shell 11 plastically or elastically deforming, cushioning, rupturing, deflating or bursting, and the
plurality of energy absorbing elements 14 cooperatively plastically or elastically deforming, as a result of
the impact.
[0042] As can be seen in this embodiment, the energy absorbing elements 14 have a dome shape, which
when subjected to a force, will resolve the force into compressive stresses along the walls of the dome,
and will push outwardly at the base. In this embodiment, the energy absorbing elements vary in size and
shape and have different depths. The larger diameter, deeper elements would deform more readily,
whereas the smaller diameter, shallower elements would provide greater resistance to deformation.
Similarly to the concept of a bridge with many arches, the plurality of dome shaped energy absorbing
elements will support their adjacent dome shaped support elements.
[0043] The impact energy absorbing device 10 may feature one or more apertures (not shown) in the
shell 11, such that in the event of an impact force, fluid (particularly gas) inside the shell can be
controllably released as the device 10 is compressed by the impact, such that the shell controllably
deflates. Alternatively, the device 10 may feature one or more valves (not shown) in the shell 11, such
that in the event of an impact force, release of fluid can be precisely controlled such that the valve
sacrificially ruptures upon a specific internal pressure being reached when the device 10 is compressed.
Alternatively, if the shell 11 does not feature apertures or valving, it may be configured to burst upon
impact.
[0044] Referring now to Figures 7A and 7B, where there is shown an impact energy absorbing device
20, according to an alternate embodiment, wherein the energy absorbing elements 24 are elongate and
arranged in a parallel fashion.
[0045] Referring now to Figures 8A and 8B, where there is shown an impact energy absorbing device
30, according to an alternate embodiment, wherein the energy absorbing elements 34 have a square form.
[0046] Referring now to Figures 9A and 9B, where there are shown alternate embodiments of an impact
energy absorbing device 40, 50, where the device 40 shown in Figure 9A features a gap between the
outwardly facing surface 42 and the energy absorbing elements 44. In alternative embodiments, such as
that shown in Figure 9B, there may be no gap between the outwardly facing surface 52 and the energy
absorbing elements 54.

                                                      6
[0047] It will be appreciated many factors will have an effect on the energy absorbing properties of the
impact energy absorbing device. As will be appreciated from the embodiments described, the form, size
and depth of the energy absorbing elements may vary. The percentage of surface area covered by the
elements may also vary. The arrangement or pattern of the energy absorbing elements may also vary. As
seen in the Figure 3, larger elements may be used, with smaller elements being placed interstitially in the
spaces between them.
[0048] Referring now to Figure 1OC, where there is shown a schematic of the child safety seat 1
incorporating the impact energy absorbing device 10 as shown in Figures 1 to 6, prior to a side impact. As
will be appreciated, when compared to the existing solution as shown in Figures 1OA and 1OB, the
plurality of impact energy absorbing elements 14 which extend between the inwardly facing surface 13
and the outwardly facing surface 12, offer an increased resistance to a side impact force, resulting in a
larger reduction in the impact force being transferred to the occupant.
[0049] Figures 1 A to 1 IE show cross-sectional schematics of a portion of an impact energy absorbing
device 60 secured to a side wing 3, before, during and after impact, for the purpose of demonstrating how
the device 60 absorbs impact energy.
[0050] Figure 1 A shows the device 60 prior to impact, where it can be seen that the outwardly facing
surface 62 is generally planar and a gap exists between the outer surface 62 and the energy absorbing
element 64.
[0051] Figure 11 B shows the device 60 during impact, where an impact force has been applied to the
outwardly facing surface 62 of the device 64. It can be seen that the outer surface 62 has deformed such
that there is no longer a gap between the outer surface 62 and the energy absorbing element 64.
[0052] Figure 11 C shows the device 60 during impact, where the outwardly facing surface 62 has now
further deformed and has transferred a portion of the impact force to the energy absorbing element 64,
and the tip of the element 64 has partially deformed to conform to the profile of the outer surface 62 as a
result of the force being applied via the surface 62.
[0053] Figure 1 ID shows the device 60 during impact, where the outer surface 62 has again further
deformed resulting in the energy absorbing element 64 further deforming as a result of the impact force
applied via the outer surface 62. Deformation of the element 64 has occurred in the form of the side wall
of the element 64 buckling.
[0054] Figure 1 IE shows the device 60 after impact, where the energy absorbing element 64 and the
outwardly facing surface 62 have sprung back to their initial state.

                                                      7
[0055] In alternative embodiments, the energy absorbing elements 64 and the outwardly facing surface
62 may plastically deform, and not return to their initial state after impact.
[0056] It will be appreciated that a complete impact energy absorbing device comprises a plurality of
energy absorbing elements, and that during impact when the outer surface of the device collapses toward
the elements, the elements will work as an array or series of impact absorbing elements, to collectively
deform under the force of the impact, resulting in the energy absorbing device collapsing over a longer
period of time. The amount of impact energy then transferred to the occupant of the restraint is reduced
compared to a 'standard' air cushion with generally flat front and back surfaces.
[0057] Throughout the specification and the claims that follow, unless the context requires otherwise, the
words "comprise" and "include" and variations such as "comprising" and "including" will be understood
to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers, but not the exclusion of any other integer or
group of integers.
[0058] The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as, an
acknowledgement of any form of suggestion that such prior art forms part of the common general
knowledge.
[0059] It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention is not restricted in its use to the
particular application described. Neither is the present invention restricted in its preferred embodiment
with regard to the particular elements and/or features described or depicted herein. It will be appreciated
that the invention is not limited to the embodiment or embodiments disclosed, but is capable of numerous
rearrangements, modifications and substitutions without departing from the scope of the invention as set
forth and defined by the following claims.
