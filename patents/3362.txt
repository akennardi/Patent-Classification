   Process for the preparation of a polyunsaturated ketone compound
   Field of the Invention
            This invention relates to a method of making a polyunsaturated thiol
 5 compound and subsequent conversion of that thiol compound into a polyunsaturated
   ketone. In particular, the invention relates to the conversion of a polyunsaturated
   alcohol to a polyunsaturated thiol compound allowing conversion of that
   polyunsaturated thiol to a polyunsaturated ketone. The invention avoids unwanted
   oxidation reactions and cis/trans isomerism reactions are substantially reduced or
10 eliminated during the synthesis. We also achieve a very high overall yield.
   Background
           Many biologically active polyunsaturated fatty acids have one or more
   carbon-carbon double bonds in the cis configuration. Free radicals have been
15 reported to support isomerization of these bonds to a less desirable trans
   configuration. Cis/trans isomerization can adversely effect polyunsaturated
   compounds intended for pharmaceutical use, for example, by reducing biological
   activity, and/or complicating synthesis. See, for example, C. Ferreri et al. (2007)
   Mol. Biotech. 37:19; Chatgilialoglu, C et al. (2002) FreeRrad. Biology & Medicine,
20 33: 1681; and WO 2002/100991.
            Some, but not all, free radicals have been reported to support cis/trans
   isomerism of particular polyunsaturated compounds. It is believed that the kinetics
   of radical-mediated oxidation depend on several parameters including the chemical
   nature of the unsaturated compound to be made, temperature, pH, presence or
25 absence of light, oxygen, etc. Free radicals have been reported to occur naturally in
   the environment or as unwanted by-products that are produced from certain
   chemical reactions. See, for example, Mengele, E.A et al. (2010) Mos. Univ.
   Chemistry Bull 65: 210.
            There have been attempts to reduce oxidation and cis/trans isomerism of
30 carbon-carbon double bonds. In one approach, an antioxidant such as octyl gallate,
   ascorbic acid, a polyphenol, mercaptoethanol, beta-carotene, or 2,6,-di-tert-butyl-4
   methylphenol (BHT), for example, is added to reduce unwanted oxidation reactions.

                                              -2
   See Mengele, E.A, ibid; Klein, E and N. Weber (2001) J Agric. Food Chem. 49:
    1224; and Hung, W-L, et al. (2011) J Agric. Food Chem. 1968.
            There have been reports that certain polyunsaturated trifluoromethyl ketone
   compounds have useful biological activities. See, for example, U.S Pat. No.
 5 7,687,543; Huwiler, A et al. (2012) Br. J Pharm. 167: 1691.
           Methods for preparing particular polyunsaturated ketones have been
   disclosed. In one method disclosing the synthesis of particular polyunsaturated
   trifluoromethyl ketones, a Mitsunobu-type reaction was used to transform an alcohol
   to the corresponding thioester. Further chemical reactions were said to produce the
10 polyunsaturated trifluoromethyl ketone (compound 18 therein) in 71% yield. See
   Holmeide, A and L. Skattebol (2000) J Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1: 2271. There
   are however concerns that this process can lead to double bond racemisation and
   unwanted oxidation reactions.
            There is general recognition that a compound intended for pharmaceutical
15 use should be produced in high yield, e.g. 70% or more. Less than satisfactory yields
   can be associated with unwanted side products. These can be costly or difficult to
   remove from the main product (API), thereby making further pharmaceutical
   development difficult. Additionally, regulatory agencies often require a detailed
   analysis of side products in compounds intended for pharmaceutical use. This
20 requirement can make scale-up costs prohibitive.
            The present inventors seek a process for the manufacture of a
   polyunsaturated thiol and eventually a corresponding polyunsaturated ketone that
   produces, after suitable purification, a pharmaceutical grade compound with
   minimal oxidation and cis/trans isomerization by products. After extensive
25 synthetic work, the inventors have determined that a particular process as claimed
   herein offers an ideal route to the compounds of the invention as the process
   operates with minimal oxidation and cis/trans isomerization by products. The
   process described herein not only achieves very high purity but achieves very high
   yield. It can also be readily scaled up to industrial operation.

   Summary of invention

                                               -3
           The present inventors have found that oxidation or racemisation of the
   double bonds is a serious problem for the molecules described herein. The
   chemistry described herein avoids or at least reduces the formation of racemised
   products and enables the formation of a polyunsaturated thiol which can be used in
 5 further (known) synthetic steps to form desired target molecules. More specifically,
   we have found a method of making a polyunsaturated thiol compound, which can
   ultimately be converted to the advantageous ketone compounds discussed herein, in
   which unwanted oxidation and cis/trans isomerization reactions are substantially
   reduced or eliminated. Practice of the invention methods can be used to produce a
10 variety of polyunsaturated ketone compounds suitable for pharmaceutical use
   including those specified herein.
           It is therefore an object of the invention to prepare pharmaceutically
   acceptable polyunsaturated thiol compounds, which can ultimately be converted to
   the advantageous ketone compounds discussed herein, in which unwanted oxidation
15 and cis/trans isomerization reactions are substantially reduced or eliminated. The
   method of the invention involves conversion of a polyunsaturated alcohol to a
   sulphonyl ester (i.e. a compound comprising the group -OS0 2 -Rx where Rx is a C1
   20 hydrocarbyl group), conversion of that sulphonyl ester to a thioester (of formula
   SCORy wherein Ry is a Cp2o hydrocarbyl group) and then reduction of that thioester
20 to a thiol (-SH) in the presence of an anti-oxidant.
           It is also an object of the invention to provide the target compounds in high
   purity, such as that which is often required by regulatory authorities.
           Preferably, subsequent steps towards the formation of the polyunsaturated
   ketone are also performed in the presence of a pharmaceutically acceptable anti
25 oxidant so as to minimize potential for oxidation or cis/trans isomerization in
   subsequent reactions.
           It is also within the scope of the invention if the polyunsaturated alcohol
   used is prepared via contact of a polyunsaturated aldehyde with a suitable
   electrophilic reducing agent under conditions sufficient to make the polyunsaturated
30 alcohol. It is again believed that use of mild electrophilic reducing agents reduces
   unwanted reduction of double bonds, thereby helping the overall synthesis achieve
   better purity.

   preparation of a polyunsaturated thiol comprising:

   Detailed Description of Invention
25
            This invention relates to a process for the manufacture of a polyunsaturated
   thiol and ultimately a polyunsaturated ketone. The process offers high yields and
   high purity. In particular, it is envisaged that after suitable purification the process
   steps of the invention provide the target compounds in pharmaceutical grade. The
30 process can also be readily scaled up for industrial operation.
            The invention provides a way of making a polyunsaturated thiol and
   subsequent conversion of that thiol to a ketone under conditions that provide the

                                                 -9
   compounds in yields and purities that are often required by regulatory authorities.
   For example, and without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that
   production of unwanted oxidation products and unwanted double bond racemisation,
   can be decreased or even eliminated following the techniques described herein.
 5           The starting material in the process of the invention is a polyunsaturated
   alcohol. Preferably that polyunsaturated alcohol is of formula (I)
                      R-OH             (I)
10           wherein R is an optionally substituted C9-2 3 unsaturated hydrocarbon group
   optionally interrupted by one or more heteroatoms or groups of heteroatoms selected
   from S, 0, N, SO, SO 2 , said hydrocarbon group comprising at least 2, preferably at
   least 4 double bonds.
             It is preferred if in any group R, double bonds are not conjugated. The group
15 R preferably comprises 5 to 9 double bonds, preferably 5 or 8 double bonds, e.g. 5 to
   7 double bonds such as 5 or 6 double bonds.
             It is also preferred if the double bonds do not conjugate with the hydroxyl
   group.
             The double bonds present in the group R may be in the cis or trans
20 configuration however, it is preferred if the majority of the double bonds present
   (i.e. at least 50%) are in the cis configuration. In further advantageous embodiments
   all the double bonds in the group R are in the cis configuration or all double bonds
   are in the cis configuration except the double bond nearest the OH group which may
   be in the trans configuration.
25           The group R may have between 9 and 23 carbon atoms, preferably 11 to 19
   carbon atoms, especially 16 to 18 carbon atoms. Carbon atoms are preferably linear
   in the R group.
             Whilst the R group can be interrupted by at least one heteroatom or group of
   heteroatoms, this is not preferred and the R group backbone preferably contains only
30 carbon atoms.
             The R group may by optionally substituted, e.g. carry up to three
   substituents, e.g. selected from halo, C1 -6 alkyl e.g. methyl, C 1.6 alkoxy. If present

                                                 -10
   the substituents are preferably non-polar, and small, e.g. a methyl group. It is
   preferred however, if the R group remains unsubstituted.
            The R group is preferably linear, i.e. there are no branches in the R chain. It
   preferably derives from a natural source such as a long chain fatty acid or ester. In
 5 particular, the R group may derive from arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid or
   eicosapentaenoic acid.
            It is thus preferred if the polyunsaturated alcohol is a compound of formula
   (I')
10                   R'-OH                   (I)
            wherein R' is a linear, unsubstituted C9-23 unsaturated hydrocarbon group,
   said hydrocarbon group comprising at least 2, preferably at least 4 double bonds.
   Ideally, R' is an alkenylene group having 9-23 carbon atoms and at least 2, such as
15 at least 4 double bonds. Preferred options for R also apply to the definition of R'.
            It may be that the polyunsaturated alcohol of use in the invention derives
   from a corresponding fatty acid or aldehyde. We have further found that when the
   polyunsaturated alcohol derives from its corresponding aldehyde, that
   polyunsaturated alcohol is preferably obtained in a reaction that involves contacting
20 a polyunsaturated aldehyde with a suitable electrophilic reducing agent under
   conditions sufficient to make the polyunsaturated alcohol. Without wishing to be
   bound to any theory, it is believed that use of mild electrophilic reducing agents
   reduce unwanted reduction of double bonds, thereby helping the overall synthesis
   achieve better yields and purity. The polyunsaturated aldehyde is therefore
25 preferably of formula R-CHO or R'CHO where R and R' are as hereinbefore
   defined.
            The use of diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAH) is particularly preferred in
   this regard. The present inventors have surprisingly found that some other well
   known reducing agents such as sodium borohydride cannot be used successfully in
30 this reduction as they increase the number of impurities formed. It is surprising that
   the use of DIBAH seems to reduce isomerism and hence minimises impurity
   formation.

                                              - 11
           The invention further comprises therefore conversion of a compound of
   formula (II) or (II')
                   RICHO or R 1,CHO        (II) or (II')
 5
           to R-OH or R'-OH using DIBAH where R and R' are as hereinbefore
   defined and R1 and R 1, are equivalent to R and R' from which a terminal -CH 2- link
   is removed. It will be appreciated that the definition of R 1 and R 1, depend on the
   definition of R and R'. During the reduction of the aldehyde a -CH 2 - group is
10 generated from which forms part of the R or R' definition and hence the R1 and R 1,
   chains are one carbon shorter than those or R and R'. Alternatively viewed, the
   reaction involves the reduction:
   RICHO or R1 ,CHO       (II) or (II') -- RICH 2-OH or to RI'CH2 -OH (III) or (III')

           wherein R1 is an optionally substituted C8 -2 2 unsaturated hydrocarbon group
   optionally interrupted by one or more heteroatoms or groups of heteroatoms selected
   from S, 0, N, SO, SO 2 , said hydrocarbon group comprising at least 2, preferably at
   least 4 double bonds; and wherein Rl' is a linear, unsubstituted C8 -2 2 unsaturated

           The aldehyde can be prepared by any suitable technique such as those
   described in J Chem Soc Perkin Trans 1, 2000, 2271-6. Alternatively, a protocol as

                 In another embodiment as explained in J Chem Soc Perkin Trans 1, 2000,
   2271-6, the alcohol can be prepared via a reduction of a fatty acid ester, conversion
 5 to an epoxide, reduction thereof to an aldehyde, optional isomerisation and further
   reduction. The scheme below summarises the reactions for AVXOO 1:
                                                                         K*CON HOH
10               The alcohol for the production of AVX002 can be prepared directly from a
   reduction of the aldehyde without an isomersation.
                 It is preferred if the alcohol starting material used in the process of the
   invention is purified using normal phase column chromatography or, preferably,
   reversed phase column chromatography.
15               In one embodiment therefore, the alcohol starting material for the process of
   the invention is obtained via the following reactions:

                                              -13
                                                  oHH
            The polyunsaturated alcohol is reacted with a sulphonyl halide, i.e. a
   compound of formula:
 5
           R 2 SO 2 Hal             (IV)
           where R 2 is a C 1-2a hydrocarbyl group, preferably C1I10 hydrocarbyl group,
   especially C1-ia alkyl group, such as C 1 .4 alkyl group, especially methyl. R 2 is
10 preferably a linear C1-20 hydrocarbyl group such as linear C1 I10 alkyl group.
            The halide (hal) can be F, Cl, Br or I, especially Br or Cl, most especially Cl.
            The reaction of the polyunsaturated alcohol with the sulphonyl halide is
   preferably effected in the presence of a base, ideally to neutralise any halide acids
   (e.g. HCl) that form during the reaction. The base should not itself react with the
15 polyunsaturated compounds. Suitable bases are well known in the art, such as
   trialkylamines, in particular triethylamine. Well known non nucleophilic bases are
   therefore appropriate.
            This reaction preferably forms therefore a compound of formula (V) or (V'):
20         R-OS0 2R 2      or       R'OS0 2R 2             (V) or (V')
           wherein R, R' and R 2 are as hereinbefore defined.
           For the avoidance of doubt, R-OS0 2 R 2 has the structure:

                                              - 14
                          0
                                R2
                        O
           Step (2) of the process of the invention requires the conversion of the
   sulphonyl ester (V)/(V') into a thioester. The -OS0 2 R 2 group is thus converted into
 5 -SC(=O)R     4 group.
           This can be achieved by reaction using a compound comprising a salt with a
    SCOR 4 ion where R 4 is a C 1-20 hydrocarbyl group. The counterion can be a metal
   such as an alkali metal, e.g. Li, Na or K. R4 is preferably a CI-10 hydrocarbyl group,
   especially a Ci-ia alkyl group, such as C1-6 alkyl group especially C 14 alkyl group
10 such as methyl. Any R 4 group is preferably linear. The use of thioacetate ions is
   thus preferred.
           The reaction forms a compound (VI) or (VI')
           R-SCOR 4         or      R'-SCOR 4        (VI) or (VI')
15
           wherein R, R' and R4 are as hereinbefore defined.
           In step (3) of the process, this thioester is then converted to a thiol. Whilst
   this can in theory be carried out using any conventional process, e.g. using
   diisobutylaluminium hydride, in order to avoid side reaction, impurity formation and
20 cis-trans isomerisation of double bonds present, the inventors propose carrying out
   this reaction in the presence of an anti-oxidant.
           It is preferred if the anti-oxidant is a small molecule such as one having a
   molecular weight of 500 g/mol or less, such as 250 g/mol or less. The anti-oxidant
   should ideally be approved for use by the FDA.
25         The anti-oxidant used is preferably butyl hydroxyanisole, butyl
   hydroxytoluene, propyl gallate, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, ascorbyl palmitate,
   thioglycerol, thioglycolic acid, sodium bisulphite, sodium sulphite, sodium
   metabisulphite, edetate tetrasodium, or EDTA.

                                             -15
            The use of tocopherol is especially preferred, particularly (+/-)-alpha
   tocopherol.
            The amount of anti-oxidant added/present may be of the order of 0.01 to 1
   mol%, preferably 0.1 to 0.5 mol% relative to the amount of polyunsaturated
 5 thioester present (in mols).
           Also, the foregoing beneficial effects can be further enhanced by making the
   polyunsaturated thiol in a reaction that involves contacting a polyunsaturated
   thioester with a suitable mild electrophilic reducing agent under conditions sufficient
   to make the polyunsaturated thiol. Without wishing to be bound to any theory, it is
10 believed that use of mild electrophilic reducing agents, as discussed below, reduce
   unwanted reduction of double bonds, thereby helping the overall synthesis achieve
   better yields and purity.
            Suitable reducing agents are ideally metal carbonates such as alkali metal
   carbonates, especially potassium carbonate. The use of a solvent such as methanol
15 is appropriate. The use therefore of a metal carbonate along with an antioxidant is
   especially preferred.
           Preferred thiols that are formed are simply of formula (VII) or (VII')
           R-SH or R'-SH           (VII) or (VII')
20
           wherein R and R' are as hereinbefore defined.
           Ideally, the thiol should have a purity of at least 90% as determined
   by HPLC (% area) at this point. More preferably purity should be 910%or
   more, such as 92% or more, ideally 93 % or more, especially 94% or even
25 95% or more.
            The process herein has been found to produce the thiol in high yield,
   e.g. 7 0% or more from step (1), such as   7 5 % or more, even 80% or more.
   Also, we can eliminate the presence of impurities detectable on HPLC.
           Ideally of course, the process of the invention targets a variety of
30 pharmaceutically-acceptable polyunsaturated ketones that are suitable for
   pharmaceutical use. Preferred compounds include a ketone group comprising an
   electron withdrawing group and a sulphur atom in the a, P, y, or 6 position from the

                                                -16
   ketone group. An electron withdrawing group or EWG draws electrons away from a
   reaction centre.
             Preferred polyunsaturated ketone targets of the invention are therefore of
   formula (VIII)
 5
             R -CO-X (VIII)
             wherein R5 is a CIO-2 4 polyunsaturated hydrocarbon group interrupted a, P, y,
   or 6 position from the ketone group by a S atom; and
10           X is an electron withdrawing group (EWG).
             Suitable electron withdrawing groups X for any compound of the invention
   are CN, phenyl, CHal 3, CHal 2H, CHalH 2 wherein Hal represents a halogen,
   especially F. The EWG is especially CHal 3 , e.g. CF 3 .
             It is most preferred if the S atom is beta to the carbonyl (thus forming a
15 group R-S-CH 2COCF 3 where R is as hereinbefore defined).
             It is preferred if in any group R5 , double bonds are not conjugated. The
   group R 5 preferably comprises 5 to 9 double bonds, preferably 5 or 8 double bonds,
   e.g. 5 to 7 double bonds such as 5 or 6 double bonds.
             It is also preferred if the double bonds do not conjugate with the carboxyl
20 group.
             The double bonds present in the group R5 may be in the cis or trans
   configuration however, it is preferred if the majority of the double bonds present
   (i.e. at least 50%) are in the cis configuration. In further advantageous embodiments
   all the double bonds in the group R5 are in the cis configuration or all double bonds
25 are in the cis configuration except the double bond nearest the S group which may
   be in the trans configuration.
             The group R5 may have between 10 and 24 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to
   20 carbon atoms, especially 17 to 19 carbon atoms. The group R5 is thus preferably
   an alkenylene group having between 10 and 24 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 20
30 carbon atoms, especially 17 to 19 carbon atoms and at least two double bonds. The
   R 5 group is preferably linear.

                                               -17
           Ideally therefore the target compounds of the invention are of formula R
   SCH 2COCF 3 or R'SCH2 COCF 3 where R and R' are as hereinbefore defined.
           In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a method of producing a
   pharmaceutically acceptable 1,1,1 -trifluoro-3 -(((2E,6Z,9Z, 12Z, 15Z,)-octadeca
 5 2,6,9,12,15-pentaein- 1-yl)thio)propan-2-one:
                                                   S     CoX
                    where X is CF 3 ; or related compound
                                                         COX
                    where X is CF 3 .
10         The last step of the process of the invention therefore involves reaction of the
   thiol with a suitable ketone to form the desired compounds of formula (VIII). The
   reaction preferably involves a compound is of formula (LG)R 3CO-X where R3
   reflects the atoms necessary to complete the R5 group where R5 = R-S-R 3 -; i.e.
            R-OH          I                    O     RSH
                                                         (LG)R 3COX
                                                     R5COX
15
           R 3 is preferably Cl-3-alkylene, such as methylene. LG represents a leaving
   group which is nucleophilicly substituted by the thiol group. A leaving group is a
   molecular fragment that departs with a pair of electrons in heterolytic bond
   cleavage. Preferably of course, (LG)R 3 -COX represents the compound LG-CH 2
20 COX, where LG is a leaving group such as a halide, tosyl, mesyl and so on. Ideally
   LG is a halide such as Br. X is an electron withdrawing group as hereinbefore
   defined in the above formulae, preferably CF3 again. Most preferably (LG)R 3 -COX
   is BrCH 2-COCF 3 .
           This final reaction step may take place in the presence of anti-oxidant as
25 hereinbefore defined. An anti-oxidant might inherently be present as carry over

                                              -18
   from the thioester conversion step and in that scenario, it may not be necessary to
   add more anti-oxidant. It is within the scope of the invention however, to add more
   anti-oxidant, e.g. where the thiol formed was purified and hence anti-oxidants
   removed.
 5         It is preferred if the anti-oxidant is a small molecule such as one having a
   molecular weight of 500 g/mol or less, such as 250 g/mol or less. The anti-oxidant
   should ideally be approved for use by the FDA.
           The anti-oxidant used is preferably butyl hydroxyanisole, butyl
   hydroxytoluene, propyl gallate, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, ascorbyl palmitate,
10 thioglycerol, thioglycolic acid, sodium bisulphite, sodium sulphite, sodium
   metabisulphite, edetate tetrasodium, or EDTA.
           The use of tocopherol is especially preferred, particularly (+/-)-alpha
   tocopherol.
           The reaction from thiol to ketone may also be encouraged by use of a mild
15 base such as a hydrogen carbonate salt to encourage nucleophilic attack of the thiol
   on the leaving group of the ketone reactant.
           It will be appreciated that the reaction products of every step of the process
   of the invention can be purified using well known procedures.
           It will be appreciated that the compounds of the invention are primarily for
20 medicinal use and hence any anti-oxidant employed is preferably pharmaceutically
   acceptable.
           The amount of antioxidant added to the polyunsaturated thiol may be
   between 0.01 to 1 mol%, 0.1 to 0.5 mol% of the polyunsaturated thiol.
           They have also learned that the presence of a pharmaceutically-acceptable
25 anti-oxidant can be used in the present methods to help reduce unwanted cis/trans
   isomerization without being destroyed or otherwise blocked.
           It will be appreciated that any reaction described herein may need to be
   carried out in the absence of oxygen, e.g. under an Ar atmosphere.
           Ideally, the ketone formed by the process of the invention should have a
30 purity of at least 90% as determined by HPLC (% area) at this point. More
   preferably purity should be 910%or more, such as 92% or more, ideally 93 % or
   more, especially 94% or even 95% or more.

                                             -19
            The process herein has been found to produce the ketone in high
   yield, e.g. 70% or more from step (1). Also, we can eliminate the presence
   of impurities detectable on HPLC.
           In a most preferred embodiment, the process of the invention includes at
 5 least the following steps:
                (1) reacting (3Z,6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadeca-3,6,9,12,15-pentaen-1-ol

10 To a solution of 1 (5.12 g, 19.7 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) at 0 C was
   added methanesulfonyl chloride (1.7 mL, 22.0 mmol) with stirring, followed by
   triethylamine (5.5 mL, 39.4 mmol). A precipitation formed immediately, giving a
   slurry. The cooling bath was removed and the reaction mixture stirred for one hour.
   The reaction mixture was poured into water (200 mL), 40 mL 1 M HCl added and
15 the aqueous phase extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 50 mL). The combined organic
   phase was washed with 5% NaHCO 3 (aq., 50 mL) and brine (50 mL), and
   subsequently dried over Na 2 SO 4 . Filtration and evaporation of solvent under reduced
   pressure yielded 6.40 g (95.9% yield) of 2 as a yellow-orange oil, which was used in

   was washed with brine (50 mL), dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and concentrated under
 5 reduced pressure. This afforded 6.26 g crude product.
   From the crude product, two 2.00 g aliquots were withdrawn and purified further
   using two different methods.
   One aliquot was applied to a 90 g silica column and eluted by way of dry column
   vacuum chromatography (DCVC, 100 mL fractions, gradient elution n-heptane
10  100:2 n-heptane:ethyl acetate). Pure fractions were combined and evaporation of
   solvent under reduced pressure gave 1.64 g of 5 as a pale yellow oil. This
   corresponds to 82.5% yield for the last step.
   A second aliquot was applied to a column with 90 g ODS-AQ stationary phase.
15 Elution was performed by way of DCVC (100 mL fractions, gradient elution 20:80
   acetonitrile:water - 70:30 acetonitrile:water), and after evaporation of acetonitrile
   from the fractions containing pure product, the product was extracted back to an
   organic solvent with 3 x 100 mL n-heptane. The combined organic extracts were
   washed with brine (50 mL), dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and concentrated under
20 reduced pressure to give 1.28 g of 5 as a pale orange oil. This corresponds to 64.4%
