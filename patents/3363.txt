                                   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
           The present invention generally relates to the measurement of physiological
10 characteristics. In particular, the present invention generally relates to a method, a system
   and a software product to measure and display the dielectric properties of the fluid mediums
   within the head and body of humans and animals.
                                       BACKGROUND ART
15
            [Mere reference to background art herein should not be construed as an admission
   that such art constitutes common general knowledge in relation to the invention.]
           Redistributions of fluids between segments of the head and body are often of central
   clinical importance, particularly in humans. This includes redistributions of fluids between
20 the intra-cellular and extra-cellular compartments within the segments. Measurement of
   these redistributions can be useful, particularly for monitoring and assessing the response
   and adaptation of the body to various orthostatic and anti-orthostatic dysfunctions.
           However, currently employed methods of measuring redistributions of fluids
   between segments of a body are either invasive or bulky and expensive. For example, tracer
25 dilution techniques involve invasively administering a dose of an appropriate tracer to the
   body, collecting blood samples, and measuring the tracer. The tracer fluid does not always
   safely disperse after the test. Alternatively, MRI technologies can be used but MRI
   equipment is both costly and bulky, making it impractical readily to measure redistributions
   of fluids between segments of a body. A further disadvantage of these techniques is that
30 they do not yield easily used real-time data during physiological stress or clinical diagnosis.
   Nor are there auto-regulation or homoeostatic balance ranges that can be applied generally to
   both adults and infants. An elderly adult, mature adult, young adult, child, infant (male or
   female) may have different ranges of auto-regulation.
           The amount of "water" that a cell takes on in the brain is of critical importance in
35 brain injury management as is the cardiovascular competence level of the heart/lung/body.

                                                     2
           The individual should be able to maintain body "homeostasis" - when the person
   cannot "Auto-regulate" then he/she has exceeded reasonable physiologic capacity.
 5                              SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
           According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a system for measuring
   physiological characteristics, the system comprising:
           a non-invasive monitor configured to generate monitor signals relating to fluid
   characteristics of body;
           a computational device operatively connected to the monitor and configured to
   process the monitor signals to generate characterising data relating to at least one of the
   regional fluid volumes, intra/extracellular fluid volume ratios and blood flow; and
           a software program installed on the computational device and configured to record,
   calculate, and display the characterising data.
           The generated characterising data may be in the form of any one or more of the
   following which are also capable of being displayed in various formats:
               1. CCe              (Cranial Compliance)
               2. CSFm             (Cerebrospinal fluid movement)
10             3.  CBF             (Cerebral blood flow)
               4. CVR              (Cardio Vascular Reactivity)
               5. RI               (extracellular resistance)
               6. R2               (intracellar resistance)
               7. C                (brain tissue capacitance)
15             8.  ReZ             (full brain tissue resistance)
               9. The ratio of reactance and resistance tgp=ImZ/ReZ - the phase angle of brain
                   bio-impedance.
               10. Spectral Analysis
           The non-invasive monitor is preferably a multi-frequency multi-channel impedance
20 rheoencephalograph (REG).
           Specifically, the rheoencephalograph is able to determine the capacitance and
   resistance for different tissue structures.         In particular, the rheoencephalograph  can
   distinguish between connective tissue and blood. In other words, the rheoencephalograph

                                                     3
   can distinguish between intracellular fluid volume of one or more cells and extracellular
   fluid.
           The system has the capacity to separately monitor the left hemisphere and the right
   hemisphere of the head as a portion of the body.
 5         The software program installed on the computational device will preferably have
   capacity to record steady state resistance on each frequency as well as the pulsing wave on 3
   frequencies. Additional frequencies may be necessary to provide even more specific
   monitoring capacity.
           The steady state resistance values are preferably received at a frequency of 100 times
10 per cardiac cycle.
           The software program is preferably automated to perform the necessary calculations
   on this monitor signals and compute values for RI, R2 and C from the data contained in the
   monitor signal and plot the changes during any single selected cardiac cycle.
           Measurements       of    basic   resistance between      electrodes    of  a   preferred
15 rheoencephalograph device are possible to calculate parameters associated with head tissue.
   From an electrical point of view, brain tissue may be represented as a set of resistances and
   capacities intricately connected to each other. Formulae can then be used to calculate the
   required parameters. Views of persons in the art differ as to the best equivalent circuit of the
   brain and the formula chosen typically depends upon which equivalent circuit of the brain is
20 selected. Two different equivalent circuits of the brain are illustrated in Figures 26 and 27.
           The equivalent electrical circuit of the brain represented in Figure 26 allows us of
   Formula (1) as follows:
                                                                                   (1
   Where:
25         Z is the brain tissue impedance;
           R, is the extracellular resistance;
           R2 is the intracellular resistance;
           C is the cellular electric capacitance;

                                                      4
            C is the angular frequency; and
           i is the imaginary unit
           The equivalent electrical circuit of the brain represented in Figure 27 allows us of
   Formula (2) as follows:
                           Z   -   (Re + R,)+iCRR                                (2)
                                            1+ i coCR
           Where:
           Z is the brain tissue impedance;
           Re is the extracranial resistance,
           Ri is the intracranial resistance;
10         C is the cellular electric capacitance; and
            C is the angular frequency.
           Future progress in this mode of calculation, which could permit additional data to be
   received, could be based on including one more frequencies, for example, any one or more
   of 16 kHz,32 kHz, 50 kHz, 100 kHz, 150 kHz, 200 kHz or 250 kHz, in addition to or instead
15 of the frequencies suggested in the preferred embodiment.
           Estimation may be performed by interpolation methods. By having three
   measurements at three various frequencies the impedance function can be approximated with
   a simpler function Z(f). Thereafter, estimation of the impedance value at a fourth frequency
   with function Z(f) can be achieved by interpolation. The calculations as presented
20 substantiate the conclusion that the transcephalic measurement of electrical impedance that
   has been used is a measurement of the electrical impedance of the whole head as the volume
   conductor from the head surface by a non-invasive method.
           The program preferably allows computation automatically of values of impedance
   parameters (R 1 , R 2 , C in circuit--Fig32 and Re, Ri, C in circuit Fig.27).
25         Input data for the preferred software are values of impedance measured at three
   preferred distinct frequencies (16 kHz, 100 kHz, 200 kHz). The least squares method can be
   used to estimate the parameters of impedance magnitude. The problem of finding the
   impedance parameters is reduced to finding the minimum of regression sum using the
   following formula:

                                                     5
                                                   3                2
                                            S    =1,          -Ii)      .
            For solving the minimum of the regression sum, the quasi--Newton BGFS method is
   preferred and is typically included in the software.
            These manipulations allow evaluation of different brain impedance parameters in
 5 each of the circuits.
            The method of calculation of CSF mobility and CCe indexes is typically presented by
   special automation on the base of selecting of systolic and diastolic fragments (pre and post
   maximal value of TCD pulse) and exporting these data to the software for display or output.
            The first step is preferably normalization of data, which consists in transformation of
10 real ranges of TCD and REG pulse changes to a scale with limits of 0.0--1.0. After this, it is
   possible to create a first "XY" plot (plot 1), where X is Doppler and Y is REG(1OOkHz).
   This plot may be approximated by a straight line (line 1). Coordinates of the first point in
   this line are (X1, Yl) and the last point are (X2; Y2). CCe value may be estimated as the
   negative tangent of the slope angle of this line.
                         CCe =k=--tana = Y2-1                                  (3)
                                                     X2 -xC
15
   where a      is the slope angle of line 1.
            Using this data, a new X',Y' plot (plot 2) is preferably created from the second half
20 of a pulse data, where X' is TCD and Y' is REG (100kHz). Next, the area parameter of the
   new plot is typically estimated.
            For this estimation, the plot is preferably approximated by a straight line (line 2). The
   coordinates of the first point in this line are (X3; Y3) and the last point are (X4; Y4).
            CSFm may be then estimated as the residual between total (line 2) area and integral
25 of (plot 2).
                     CSFn=(                )*(x -xx   )-  X2  f(x)dr                (4)
                                    2                    xi
   where f(x) is the function of plot 2.

                                                    6
            The software is preferably automated to perform the necessary calculations on the
   data and compute values for R 1, R2 and C from this data and plot the changes during any
   single selected cardiac cycle.
            According to a particularly preferred embodiment, there are two different ways of
 5 analysing multi-frequency data:
            1. Calculations of R 1, R2, C based on resistance values between electrodes with three
   different frequencies gives information about steady state conditions for comparison with
   different individuals or for the same individual with different conditions - For example
   before and after brain surgery as well as evaluation of changes in brain tissue during the
10 recovery period. For this purpose it is necessary to calculate these parameters every 5
   seconds.
            2. Calculations of changes of R 1, R2 , C during the cardiac cycle. R1 represents the
   resistance of the skull bones and its soft tissues.      If a value of R1 is only occasionally
   sampled it will always be 'generally unchanging'. However if it is sampled 100 times per
15 cardiac cycle the values will demonstrate a pulsating wave and should correspond to CCe or
   the elasticity of the skull bones during the cardiac cycle.
            The software of one preferred embodiment also allows the calculation of spectral
   analysis.
            The accuracy of the method can be (and has been) confirmed by comparing the
20 resistance spectrum to the rheoencephalograph pulsing spectrum (i.e. slow fluctuations).
   R2/C   =  changing of intracranial fluids divided by the unchanging value of the brain tissue
   should correspond to CSFm.
            The rheoencephalograph and software of the preferred embodiment provides a
   completely new way to evaluate intracranial fluid dynamics without the use of Doppler.
25 Additionally, it provides a basis for the meaning of CCe as essentially being a measurement
   of skull bone elasticity.
            Based on the fact that the reactive component "C" (capacitance) depends on the
   frequency of the current - measurements of basic resistance between electrodes while using a
   number, typically three different preferred frequencies (16, 100 and 200 kHz are examples of
30 frequencies used in the preferred embodiment)              - allows for calculation, by three
   mathematical equations, of the values of:
            Brain tissue impedance RI (extracellular resistance),

                                                     7
           R2 (intracellar resistance)
           C (brain tissue capacitance)
           and also the full brain tissue resistance (the real part of complex impedance ReZ) and
 5 the reactance (ImZ). In addition, the software can also preferably calculate the ratio of
   reactance and resistance tgp=ImZ/ReZ - the phase angle of brain bio-impedance.
           The software of the preferred embodiment preferably calculates and delivers these
   mathematically calculated values automatically from the basic resistance. This approach
   allows the separation of extracranial components from the intracranial components as they
10 are represented in the values of the basic resistance between electrodes. Failure to separate
   these components had previously been the main deterrent and limitation to widespread use of
   the rheoencephalograph method as a "stand alone" method for cerebral investigations.
           The underpinning of the present amount is the concept that the amount of "water"
   that a cell takes on in the brain is of critical importance in brain injury management as is the
15 cardiovascular competence level of the heart/lung/body.
           The individual should be able to maintain body "homeostasis" - when the person
   cannot "Auto-regulate" then he/she has exceeded reasonable physiologic capacity. This
   invention provides a means whereby the physiological aspects of the head and/or body
   related to the distribution of fluids can be monitored and displayed in real or near real time.
20         More particularly, the present invention relates to monitoring head and/or body
   segment impedances for determining fluid volumes and fluid flows in a head and body in
   real or near real time.
           Also blood pressure, temperature, ECG, and the oxygen saturation level of the blood
   and blood flow characteristics may be incorporated for analysing trends of an auto-regulation
25 phase particular to an individual.
           This invention provides an improved method of analysing physiological data using a
   rheoencephalograph and the software.
           In one embodiment, the computational device or computer and software are
   configured for determining fluid volumes and fluid flows in a head and/or body in at least
30 near real time which overcomes or ameliorates one or more of the disadvantages or problems
   described above, or which at least provides a useful alternative. One embodiment of the
   invention discloses a critical real time analysis combining the display of different types of

                                                   8
   data simultaneously. This results in more time efficiency and effective decision-making, and
   the choice of the correct medical intervention to be applied.
            For the sake of convenience, the term "monitor" should be understood to mean one or
   more monitors.
            The non-invasive monitor is preferably a rheoencephalograph and preferably a multi
   frequency, multi channel rheoencephalograph.
 5          Specifically the rheoencephalograph developed may operate on multiple frequencies
   simultaneously, or be electronically switched automatically between frequencies (16, 100,
   200 Kilohertz) at an adjustable rate to record and calculate simultaneously the desired
   physiological data including the capacitance and resistance for different tissue structures
   connective tissue vs. blood (intracellular fluid volume of one or more cells vs. extracellular
10 fluid), and may be configured to display for head and/or body segments. In one embodiment,
   the monitor may be a single instrument with all fluids monitored down to intracellular and
   extracellular fluid levels.
            The system may include at least two excitation electrodes for providing an electrical
   stimulus across selected head and/or body regions. The system typically also includes at
   leats one or more monitoring electrodes.
            The monitor may have a number of electrodes that are configured for placement in a
   non-invasive manner in to operative engagement with the head or body; such that at least
   one electrode engages each of a number of respective segments of the head and/or body.
            The monitor may be configured to use any number of different frequencies, but three
   frequencies have been found to provide the optimum number of frequencies with a spread of
   frequencies chosen to provide sufficient information to allow calculation of all desired
   characterising parameters.
            The software of the preferred embodiment may be configured to store the impedance
   parameters, extract data segments relating to test sequences, the calculated data graphs,
   spectral analysis graphs and resultant calculations in to a database for subsequent access and
   comparison of the subject's physiological conditions. Furthermore, the software preferably
   allows queries to be run on the database to provide comparative analysis based on a
   cumulative database structure enabling detection of anomalous subject conditions. An array
   of subject tests can be configured to allow different subject test results to be compared on a
   multiple display. Near real time monitoring of the subject's physiologic condition can be
   relayed to a larger screen via HDMI or VGA output.

                                                   9
           The software of the preferred embodiment may be configured to output the
   characterizing data in any one or more of the following forms:
           a)      real-time;
           b)      replay of previously recorded characterizing data; and/or
           c)      together with mathematically reconstructed waveforms or graphs.
           According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for
   measuring physiological characteristics, the method comprising the steps of:
           engaging a non-invasive monitor with a body, the non-invasive monitor being
   configured to generate monitor signals relating to fluid characteristics in the body;
           processing the monitor signals to generate characterising data relating to at least one
   of regional fluid volumes, intra/extracellular fluid volume ratios and blood flow; and
           outputting the characterising data.
           The step of engaging a non-invasive monitor with a body may include the step of
   engaging an electrode montage with the body such that any one or more segments of the
   body are monitored, including for example a head segment, a chest segment, a splanchnic
   segment, a pelvic segment and a leg segment.
           The chest segment, the splanchnic segment, the pelvic segment and the leg/arm
   segments may be monitored using an initial instance of the rheoencephalograph, while the
   head segment may be monitored using a second instance of the rheoencephalograph.
           The step of processing the monitor signals may include the step of processing the
   monitor signals to generate resistance and reactive capacitance data and to process that data
   to generate the characterizing data.
 5         The step of outputting the characterising data may include the step of normalizing the
   data and displaying the data visually and/or outputting in a computer readable form.
           The characterizing data may be output in any one or more of the following forms:
           a)      real-time;
           b)      replay of previously recorded characterizing data; and/or
           c)      together with mathematically reconstructed waveforms.
           It follows that the system and method of the invention output and monitor fluid data,
   including fluid movement data, between the brain/head, chest, abdomen, pelvis, thigh, lower
10 legs, and arms regions of a body. The output fluid information of these body regions may
   provide descriptions of the hemodynamic and volume responses in a human body in
   conjunction with other physiological data.

                                                   10
            The output may be used to characterise regional fluid volumes, intra/extracellular
   fluid volume ratios, hemodynamic status and blood flow in real time during clinical and
   research protocols that allows the quantification of segmental blood flows, total segmental
   volumes, and segmental compartment volumes in real time. In the event of trauma and in the
 5 absence of outward signs of injury, the detection of abnormal blood pooling or flow is
   critical in the diagnosis and application of specific treatment.
            The microprocessor system may store impedance parameters and signal waveform
   segments prior to supplying the data to the connected computer. The computer may be
   programmed with a software product in accordance with the invention such that the
10 computer uses a de-convolution algorithm on data obtained from the microprocessor system
   to obtain parameters for an R-C equivalent circuit used to model the intravascular, interstitial
   and intracellular fluid spaces.
            In one embodiment, the rheoencephalograph will be portable. Furthermore, the
   rheoencephalograph may be configured to independently monitor the fluid data itself.
15          The rheoencephalograph electrode leads may need shielding along the length of the
   electrode leads to prevent interference such as environmental interference. The electrodes
   may be disposable EKG electrodes.
            The instruments of the system and method may be battery powered, power supply
   powered, or a combination of both. A voltage level indicator may be provided on all battery
20 powered devices (if any) and the voltage level is read prior to conducting tests to ensure
   adequate battery power is available for the tests.
            According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a computer program
   product comprising a computer usable medium including a computer readable program for
   measuring physiological aspects, wherein the computer readable program, when executed on
25 a computer, causes the computer to:
            process data received from a non-invasive monitor engaged with the body to generate
   characterizing data relating to at least one of regional fluid volumes, intra/extracellular fluid
   volume ratios and blood flow; and
            output the characterising data.
30          The computer readable program, when executed on a computer, may cause the
   computer to output the characterising data in one of the following forms:
            a)       real-time

30                     DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
                   Figure 1 shows broadly, a system, in accordance with the invention, for
   measuring physiological aspects of a body. The system includes a computer 10 that defines a
   computational device and a data output device of the invention. Output data 11 generated by

                                                     13
   the computer 10 can be graphs displayed on a screen of the computer 10, but may take any
   suitable form, such as tables or metrics.         The computer 10 is connected to impedance
   spectroscopic (EIS) and/or impedance plethysmographic (IPG) monitors represented with
   reference 13 in figure 1, via a microprocessor system 14 which is in turn connected via serial
 5 cable 12. The computer 10 can be a stationary desktop model or preferably a laptop
   computer for portability. For the sake of convenience, the monitors will be referred to as the
   monitor 13.
           In the embodiment shown in figure 1, the cable 12 is connected to the computer 10
   using a universal serial bus (USB) interface, but it is envisaged that other interfaces could be
10 used, such as wireless or Bluetooth.
           Different frequencies can be selected for use by the Multi Frequency Multi Channel
   REG monitor 13, however 16Khz, 100Khz,and 200Khz have been found to be the most
   suitable for the RI, R2 and C calculations. Where the monitor is an EIS monitor, it uses a
   constant current transformer coupled excitation stage in conjunction with a digital
15 demodulation stage to supply both resistive and reactive impedance components. Thus, the
   monitor 13 can be configured to generate monitor signals relating to fluid characteristics in
   the body, in this example, said fluid characteristics being resistive and reactive impedance
   components. The microprocessor system 14 stores data in the form of impedance parameters
   and signal waveform segments carried by the monitor signals prior to communicating the
20 data to the computer 10 for processing to generate characterising data for on-line real time
   analysis and display.
           A software product, in accordance with the invention, when executed by the
   computer 10, uses a de-convolution algorithm applied to the impedance parameters and
   signal waveform segments to obtain parameters for an R-C equivalent circuit used to model
25 the intravascular, interstitial, and intracellular fluid spaces.
           The monitor 13 is connected to a montage 15 having ten electrodes 16. As depicted
   in figure 2, a suitable electrode montage is provided which divides the body into five
   segments for segmental blood flows and volume change analysis. These are a head segment
   20, a chest segment 21, a splanchnic segment 22, a pelvic segment 23, and a leg segment 24.
30 The chest segment 21, splanchnic segment 22, pelvic segment 23, and leg segment 24 of the
   body are monitored by the monitor 13 using a tetrapolar impedance system. The head
   segment 20 is monitored by the monitor 13 using a bipolar impedance configuration for
   monitoring cerebral (head) blood flow responses.

                                                   14
           As depicted in figure 19, a suitable electrode montage is provided which attaches to
   the head and can also be configured to attach to the body segments for segmental blood
   flows and volume change analysis. Possible configurations are a head segment 20, a chest
   segment 21, a splanchnic segment 22, a pelvic segment 23, and a leg segment 24. The chest
 5 segment 21, splanchnic segment 22, pelvic segment 23, and leg segment 24 of the body are
   monitored by the monitor 8 Multiple Monitors (8) can be used if more channels are required.
           Electrodes 25 and 26 are excitation electrodes for supplying a minute electrical
   charge at different frequencies to the body to be read by the other electrodes.
           The electrodes need shielding along the length of the electrode leads to prevent
10 interference such as environmental interference. A suitable electrode is a general purpose
   disposable EKG electrode.
           Normalised output results from the electrode montage of figure 2 are depicted in
   figure 3. Four readings (A to D) were taken from subjects for the five segments described
   above. Readings A to D are different cases/patients used and the five segments correspond
15 to the following five body segments: head, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and thigh.
           When the computer 10 executes the software product of the invention, the computer
   10 generates data relating to segmental resistance, volume, and normalized volume changes
   during exercise stress. These are shown in the following table for a test subject 'TCV'. Of
   the three columns of data, the first column is the resistance in ohms, the second column is
20 extracellular volume (VE) in ml, and the third column is VE over body surface area ml/mA2.

            Impedance data can be recorded from the body segments in, or near, real time and
   within a clinical environment. A vector board version can also be used to generate resistance
   or reactance recordings at various EIS input sampling frequencies.
            An example output plot from the IPG of resistance (Ro) vs capacitive reactance (Xc)
15 for a test subject is illustrated in figure 6. The plot has two sweeps; the first sweep being
   taken after the subject has had his leg low for 2 minutes and the second sweep being taken

                                                   16
   after the subject has had both legs put up on a desk for 4 minutes. It is clearly seen that
   although the capacitive reactance is very similar in each case, that the resistance has been
   increased by about 5 ohms resulting in a shift to the right in the plot.
            Where the IPG or EIS monitor is a Tetrapolar High Resolution Impedance Meter
 5 (THRIM), such a monitor is a swept frequency THRIM that can provide the Ro and Xc data
   for a total of 40 log separated excitation frequencies from 3.2 to 281 KHz. The THRIM also
   provides a constant current, transformer isolated sine wave excitation signal, with a means
   being provided to trim the excitation current. The THRIM also includes 12 bit analogue to
   digital sampling for the Ro and Xc data as well as an RS-232 serial or USB interface, and
10 computer software. The software product of this invention allows for configuration of the
   THRIM, control of the frequency sweeping function, and retrieval and storage of the
   impedance data.
            The computer 10, when executing a software product of the invention, can provide a
   plot of each calculated parameter and compartment volume as functions of either sweep or
15 sequence numbers (as shown in figure 7). Parameter values of alpha (a locus angle), and Cm
   (membrane capacitance) are plotted in the top two traces. Interstitial, intracellular, and blood
   compartment volumes are then shown in the remaining traces as VInstl , VIcell, and Vblood
   respectively. The values are obtained from the resistance and reactive impedance or
   capacitance measurements carried out by the monitor 13. More particularly, the computer 10
20 is configured to store an executable deconvolution algorithm for processing the resistance
   and reactive impedance data to generate parameters for an R-C equivalent circuit used to
   generate the characterising data in the form of the interstitial, intracellular and blood
   compartment volumes.
            Example output results from the EIS are shown in figure 8, demonstrating the type of
25 measurements that can be made using electrical impedance spectroscopy. It shows changes
   in the intracellular and interstitial segments of the extravascular compartment in addition to
   changes that may take place within the vascular system over a period of four minutes. These
   results were obtained using a particular piece of exercise equipment and thus are only typical
   of a subject using this particular equipment. When using a fixed frequency version of the
30 IPG, the     capabilities  of such      an  IPG make      it possible    to monitor    numerous
   cardiovascular/fluid compartment physiologic changes that take place within various
   segments of the body and to investigate the interaction between body segments.

                                                    17
            An aspect of the invention relates to the manner in which the data is collated and
   organised for analysis. Accordingly, the software product of the invention is configured to
   facilitate such collection and organisation. Figures 9 to 17 are flowcharts that represent a
   method of collecting and processing data generated by the system of the invention. In
 5 particular, the software product of the invention is configured so that when executed by at
   least the computer 10, at least the computer 10 carries out the steps indicated in these
   flowcharts. For convenience, this example is described assuming that only the computer 10
   carries out the steps of the method. Thus, in the following description, the phrase "the
   computer 10 carries out    ..." should be understood to mean that, when the software product of
10 the invention is executed by at least the computer 10, at least the computer 10 carries out the
   relevant step. In light of that, it is to be appreciated that the steps are set out below can
   readily be carried out on one or more further dedicated components.
            In figure 9, reference 30 generally indicates a flow chart representing a data
   collection method carried out when the software product is executed. At 32, the software
15 product initiates a method by opening the program of the software product. At 34, the
   computer 10 queries a user as to the time when data was previously backed up. If the
   response is such that the data was backed up more than a predetermined period of time ago,
   the computer 10 requests that the user engage some form of removable storage device or
   media with the computer 10, at 36. If the response is such that the data was backed up less
20 than said predetermined period of time ago, the computer queries as to whether or not the
   user would like to create a backup, at 38. If the response is positive, the computer requests
   that said some form of removable storage device or media be engaged with the computer 10,
   at 40. Otherwise, the computer 10 queries as to whether this particular opening is an initial
   opening at 42.
25          If the response is positive, the computer 10 requests the input of initial settings at 44.
   Otherwise, the computer 10 requests that the user log in using his or her log in details at 46
   (Figure 10). The log in details can include security options such as fingerprint data, local
   recognition or iris scan.
            The computer 10 then queries whether or not the user is logged in to an existing
30 account at 48. If the answer is negative, the computer 10 creates a new account and/or
   options to create a new voice profile for dictation and configures the settings at 50.
   Otherwise, the computer 10 queries whether or not the user wishes to use his or her existing
   settings, at 52. If the answer is positive, the computer 10 allows for settings to be selected

                                                   18
   and adjusted and also allows for workflow and set up to be carried out, at 54. Otherwise, the
   computer 10 makes a number of tabs available for the user at 56.

   data selected with a handheld device. At 106, the computer 10 displays the results of the
   sensor settings.
           In figure 12, reference 110 generally indicates a flow chart for allowing a user to
30 capture data with the computer 10 executing a software product of the invention.
           At 112, the user is prompted to enter information regarding the subject. This can be
   done by way of drop-downs and checkboxes. At 114, the computer 10 creates a new patient
   data base or adds the patient data to a data base at 116. The computer 10 then queries as to

                                                   19
   whether the relevant monitor is connected at 118. If the response is negative, the computer
   10 generates a warning, at 120, for connection of the monitor to the patient. If the response is
   positive, the computer 10 generates a number of tabs, at 122 for capturing data. More
   specifically, the computer 10 generates a "start new session" tab at 124, a "start monitor" tab
 5 at 126 and an "analyse data" tab at 128.
           If the tab 126 is selected, the computer 10 collects the data at 130. At 132, the user is
   able to select a command for the computer 10 to allow the user to select data to be displayed
   using a handheld device at 134. At 136, the results of the data collection are displayed on a
   screen. If the user selects the command at 132, the computer 10 queries a user as to whether
10 or not he or she wishes to carry out an analysis, at 138. If the response is positive, the
   computer 10 displays the tab 128. Then, the computer 10 performs the analysis at 140. The
   user is then prompted to save the results of the analysis, at 142, to the data base at 116.
   Otherwise, the computer 10 returns to the step at 112.
           In figure 13, reference 150 generally indicates a flow chart representing the possible
15 steps subsequent to the "analyse data" tab being selected. At 152, the user is prompted to

   displayed. At 156, the results of the selection are displayed on a screen and the computer 10
   is able to export the data to a spreadsheet application. At 158, the computer 10 displays the
   results of the analysis on a screen. At 160, the results are saved to a data base.
20         Reference 162 generally indicates a flow chart representing the possible steps
   subsequent to a "second phase analysis" tab being selected. At 164, the computer 10 loads a
   new session. At 166, the computer 10 allows the user to select a doctor or a data base and
   also to select a patient and data relating to the patient. At 168, the computer 10 sets
   parameters and adds relevant mathematical calculations to assist the analysis. Also at 168,
25 channels representing data from different regions sensed by the monitor 13 can be compared.
   Also, at 168, the computer 10 can add further channels for analysis. At 170, the computer 10
   allows the user to select the data to be displayed with a handheld device. At 172, the
   computer 10 displays the results of the selection on a screen. This can be a full replay of the
   collected data or modified data.

           In figure 14, reference 190 generally indicates a flow chart representing the possible
   steps subsequent to an "import/export" tab being selected
           At 192, the computer 10 queries whether or not data should be imported. If the
   response is positive, the computer 10 requests the user to select a source, such as a thumb
10 drive, CD or DVD, at 194. At 196, the computer 10 queries as to whether or not the relevant
   source is present. If the answer is negative, the user is prompted to engage the relevant
   source with the computer 10, at 198. If the answer is positive, the computer 10 imports the
   relevant data, in this case data relating to the subject, at 200. At 202, the computer 10 detects
   whether or not encryption is present in the source and carries out a decryption process. At
15 204, the computer 10 confirms successful importation.

   select a source, such as a thumb drive, CD or DVD, at 206. At 208, the computer 10 queries
   as to whether or not the relevant source is present. If the answer is negative, the user is
   prompted to engage the relevant source with the computer 10, at 198. If the answer is
20 positive, the computer 10 exports the relevant data, in this case data relating to the subject, at
   210, to the relevant source. At 212, the computer 10 confirms that the data has been
   exported. At 214, the computer queries whether or not encryption of the data is required. If
   the answer is positive, the computer 10 carries out an encryption process at 216. At 218, the
   computer 10 confirms successful exportation. At 220, the user is prompted to remove the
25 relevant source.
           In figure 15, reference 222 generally indicates a flow chart representing the possible
   steps taken by the computer 10 when an "e-mail" tab is selected. At 224, the computer 10
   opens an e-mail form in which a current data result is represented. At 226, the computer 10
   prepares the e-mail form for sending, once it has been completed. At 228, the computer 10
30 queries as to whether or not an e-mail system has been configured. If the response is
   negative, the computer 10 carries out an e-mail form configuration process at 230, and
   queries, at 232, as to whether or not the form should be encrypted. If the response is positive,
   the computer 10 moves directly to the query at 232. If the response to the query at 232 is

                                                  21
   positive, the computer 10 carries out an encryption process on the form at 234 and sends the
   e-mail form at 236. If the response to the query is negative, the computer 10 moves directly
   to the step of sending the e-mail form at 236.
            Reference 260 generally indicates a step taken when a "print" tab is selected. At 262,
 5 the computer 10 prince or exports currently displayed data to a printer or to a further
   document.
            In figure 16, reference 240 generally indicates a flow chart representing the possible
   steps taken by the computer 10 when a "program setup" tab is selected. At 242, the computer
   10 queries whether or not a communications port has been detected. If the response is
10 negative, the user is prompted to ensure that the monitor is properly attached at 244. If the
   response is positive, the user is prompted to select the communications port and the monitor
   system, at 246. At 248, the computer 10 selects relevant system settings for data
   compatibility. At 250, the computer 10 adds doctor or site data. At 252, the computer 10
   writes the setup data to a system configuration file.

   steps taken by the computer 10 when an "exit program" tab is selected. At 262, the computer
   10 queries whether or not a backup of the data should be created. If the response is positive,
   the computer 10 prompts the user, at 264, to insert the relevant removable media to which
   the data to be backed up is to be written. Also at 264, the data to be backed up is written to
20 the removable media. The computer 10 exits the program at 266. If the response is negative,
   the computer 10 moves directly to the step at 266.
            Reference 270 shows the possible step taken when a "program help" tab is selected.
   The computer 10 generates a detailed HTML help system that is itemised with training
   videos, troubleshooting and setup instructions, at 272.
25          The invention may be useful in the treatment of diverse pathophysiologic fluid
   volume states including, for example, the management of increased intracranial pressure
   following trauma, the treatment of disequilibrium and hypotension during renal dialysis, the
   monitoring of the hydrational state of premature infants, and the investigation and diagnosis
   of orthostatic intolerance associated with dysautonomia.
30          The impedance system can be used to assess the possible compartment changes
   monitoring two body segments at the same time. In this way, it will provide information
   regarding the fluid volume redistribution between two body segments in addition to the
   extent of intra/extravascular fluid shifts within a single body segment. In order to achieve

                                                  22
   this, the software product of the invention can be configured to be executed by the monitor
   13. Thus, the monitor 13 can be configured to cooperate with other equipment to administer
   treatment to the subject. An example of this would be a dosage meter. In one embodiment,
   all computer programming will be applied to a small, portable EIS that can be used to
 5 monitor the intra/extravascular compartment volumes.
            By continuous measurements of segmental blood flow and fluid volume changes, it
   will be possible to assess all of the individual fluid compartments of the body in terms of
   intracellular volume, interstitial volume, and intravascular volume.
            Other areas of potential application of the invention include the hydration state of
10 premature infants and burn patients, quantification of segmental and cerebral fluid shifts that
   take place during orthostatic tests and exposure to microgravity, and the assessment of
   various countermeasures designed to reduce the stress of re-entry.
            The methodology explained above can be used with an alternative monitor in the
   form of a rheoencephlagraph. Normally, at least a portion of the montage of electrodes are
15 provide on a head band or similar adapted to be worn by a test subject for the tests. The head
   band may further include positioning portions to ensure as much as possible that the
   electrodes are positioned correctly on the subject's head.
            Figure 18 shows, broadly, a system, in accordance with the invention, for measuring
   physiological aspects of a body. The system includes a computer 10 that defines a
20 computational device and a data output device of the invention. Output data 11 generated by
   the computer 10 can be graphs displayed on a screen of the computer 10, but may take any
   suitable form, such as graphs, tables or metrics.        The computer 10 is connected to a
   rheoencephalograph (8). The computer 10 can be a stationary desktop model or preferably a
   laptop computer for portability. For the sake of convenience, the rheoencephalograph will be
25 referred to as the monitor 8.
            In the embodiment shown in figure 18, the cable 12 is connected to the computer 10
   using a universal serial bus (USB) interface, but it is envisaged that other interfaces could be
   used, such as wireless or Bluetooth.
            Different frequencies can be selected for use by the monitor (8), however 16Khz,
30 100Khz, and 200Khz have been found to be the most suitable for the RI, R2 and C
   calculations. Where the monitor is an EIS monitor, it uses a constant current transformer
   coupled excitation stage in conjunction with a digital demodulation stage to supply both
   resistive and reactive impedance components. Thus, the monitor 8 can be configured to

                                                    23
   generate monitor signals relating to fluid characteristics in the head or body; in this example,
   said fluid characteristics       being resistive and reactive impedance      components.    The
   microprocessor system 14 stores data in the form of impedance parameters and signal
   waveform segments carried by the monitor signals prior to communicating the data to the
 5 computer 10 for processing to generate characterizing data for on-line real time analysis and
   display.
            The software in accordance with the invention, when executed by the computer 10,
   uses a de-convolution algorithm applied to the impedance parameters and signal waveform
   segments to obtain parameters for an R-C equivalent circuit used to model the intravascular,
10 interstitial, and intracellular fluid spaces.
            The rheoencephlaloraph 8 is connected to a montage 15 having multiple electrodes
   16. As depicted in figure 18, a suitable electrode montage is provided which attaches to the
   head and can also be configured to attach to the body segments for segmental blood flows
   and volume change analysis.
15          The system illustrated in Figure 18 shows a system, in accordance with the invention,
   for measuring physiological characteristics configured for laboratory examination and proof
   of concept. Specifically, the montage 15 is connected to a rheoencephalograph system
   1801but also to a TCD 1800 (Trans Cranial Doppler) system with a dedicated laptop for the
   TCD, for comparing the efficacy of the rheoencephlagraph measurement.
20          The rheoencephalograph laptop with the software for collating, calculating and
   displaying the physiological data is provided in association with the rheoencephalograph
   system but separately from the TCD in order to confirm the consistency of the results
   between the rheoencephalograph and the TCD. Other measurements can be taken such as
   through use of an electroencephalogram or EEG as illustrated.
25          Figure 19 shows a portable configuration wherein the rheoencephalograph is battery
   powered, as is the portable computer, touchpad or smartphone.
            Both devices in this example are battery powered. The rheoencephalograph in this
   example is using the automated calculation function in the software to perform the necessary
   calculations on this data and compute values for RI, R2 and C from this data and plot the
30 changes during any single selected cardiac cycle.
            The software is capable of being deployed on multiple platforms and can convey data
   feeds to a network for further analysis by a laboratory or display the subject's physiological
   data on its own screen.

                                                  24
           Impedance data can be recorded from the head and body segments in, or near, real
   time and within a clinical environment or in a field location. The data once saved to the
   database can be used to produce a calculation on selected parameters, produce spectrum and
   CVR graphs, and provide an interface whereby the user can view comparative tests or weigh
 5 the subject's results against a cumulative database to detect anomalous results.
           The rheoencephalograph has the capacity to record steady state resistance on each
   frequency as well as the pulsing wave on 3 frequencies. The steady state resistance values
   will be received at a frequency of 100 times per cardiac cycle. Software has been automated
   to perform the necessary calculations on this data and compute values for RI, R2 and C from
10 this data and plot the changes during any single selected cardiac cycle. The software product
   of this invention allows for configuration of the rheoencephalograph, control of the
   frequency selection, and retrieval, display and storage of the impedance data in a
   configurable graphed or tabled format.
           The software is capable of exporting and importing data from other systems,
15 automating backup procedures, capturing additional data for subjects using forms, has
   provision for administrators to create new test protocols and can create a cumulative
   database.
