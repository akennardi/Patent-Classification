BARBECUE WITH SPIT FUNCTIONALITY
Field
[0001] The present invention relates to a barbecue. In particular, the present invention has been
developed in respect of a barbecue that has a spit functionality, and will be described hereinafter
in this context in this application.
Background of the Invention
[0002] Barbecue spits, or rotisseries, are known. They are used to cook whole or large portions
of various meats. Known barbecue spits typically comprise a large rectangular container that
holds charcoal or firewood, a pair of vertical supports fixed to either end of the body and a spit
rod that is mounted across the vertical supports. The spit rod, which holds the meat, is rotated
over the hot charcoals, thus allowing the meat to cook evenly. Rotation of the spit rod is
typically driven by a motor.
[0003] A disadvantage of known barbecue spit arrangements is that they are typically bulky in
size and have a number of components that require manual assembly prior to use. Also, keeping
known barbecue spits assembled in a "ready to use" state is impractical and/or difficult due to
their bulky size. Further, the disparate sizes and multitude of the various components makes the
assembly of the barbecue spit difficult and time consuming. It is also difficult to regulate heat
supplied to a spit above the grill area of the barbecue, especially in solid-fuel barbecues that bum
solid fuel, such as wood, charcoal, or briquettes. The process of dismantling and storing the
barbecue spit, after it has been used, also requires a substantial amount of time and effort.
Object of the Invention
[0004] It is an object of the present invention to provide a barbecue with spit functionality that
substantially overcomes one or more of the above disadvantages, or at least provides a useful
alternative.

                                                    2
Summary of the Invention
[0005] According to one aspect, the present invention provides a barbecue with spit
functionality, the barbecue including: a barbecue body having a grill area adapted to receive
charcoal or firewood for cooking, and a first opening and a second opening; a first spit support
member to be mounted in the first opening at a use position, in which the first spit support
member at least partially protrudes from the barbecue body; and a second spit support member to
be mounted in the second opening at a use position, in which the second spit support member at
least partially protrudes from the barbecue body. A spit rod is releasably engageable with the
first and second spit support members (i.e. extending between them) in their respective use
positions for supporting meat to be cooked above the grill area, wherein a height of the spit rod
above the charcoal or firewood in the grill area is settable or adjustable to a desired spit roasting
height to suit a type and size of the meat to be cooked.
[0006] In a preferred embodiment, the barbecue includes a height-setting device or mechanism

[0009] In a preferred embodiment, the barbecue body includes a storage compartment. The
storage compartment is preferably arranged below the grill area and/or below the grill interior.
In this regard, the barbecue body preferably includes one or more storage doors, typically at the
front side of the barbecue body, to provide access to the storage compartment.
[0010] In a preferred embodiment, one of the first and second spit support members houses a
drive system for driving rotation of the spit rod when the spit rod is engaged with the first and
second spit support members in their respective use positions. The spit rod drive system includes
a motor, especially an electric motor, housed with the spit support member. The drive system
may also include a gear drive or gear mechanism operatively coupled to the motor and housed
within the spit support member.
[0011] As noted above, the barbecue preferably includes a height-setting device or mechanism
for setting or adjusting the height of the spit rod above the charcoal or firewood in the grill area.
The height-setting device or mechanism includes: a substantially vertical elongate slot and a
plurality of lateral slots extending therefrom, each of which lateral slots defines a different spit
roasting height. The height-setting device or mechanism further includes a knob or pin that is
movable along the substantially vertical elongate slot or track and is settable in any one of the
lateral slots extending therefrom to select and set the desired spit roasting height.
[0012] In a preferred embodiment, the first spit support member mounted in the first opening is
settable at a storage position, in which the first spit support member is substantially contained
within the barbecue body. The second spit support member mounted in the second opening is

Description of Embodiments
[0022] Figs. 1 and 2 show a first preferred embodiment of a barbecue 20 with spit functionality.
The barbecue 20 is of free-standing form and includes a generally rectangular barbecue body 22,
with a first spit support member 24 and a second spit support member 26 protruding therefrom.
The barbecue body 22 has a height of about 640 mm, a length of about 1265 mm, and a width of
about 500 mm. As can be seen in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, at its upper side the barbecue body 22 has a
first opening 28, a second opening 30 and a top surface 32. The first spit support member 24 is
mounted in the first opening 28 and the second spit support member 26 is mounted in the second
opening 30. The first and second spit support members 24 and 26 themselves have top surfaces
25 and 27, respectively.
[0023] Referring further to Figs. 1 and 2, the barbecue 20 also includes a spit rod 34, of square
cross-section, that is mounted on or engaged with and extends between the first and spit second
support members 24 and 26. The spit rod 34 includes a handle 36 and spit forks 37a and 37b.
The barbecue body 22 includes a grill area 38 having a grill interior 40 for receiving charcoal or
firewood to cook the meat on the spit rod 34 and a grill rack 42 arranged above the grill interior.
The barbecue body 22 further includes a plurality of ventilation slots 44 for ventilation of the
grill interior 40, as well as front handles 46a and 46b, side handles 48a and 48b, and legs 50.
The legs 50 include castor wheels 52 on one side of the barbecue body 22, and rubber heels 54
on the other side of the barbecue body 22. The legs 50 have a height of approximately 260 mm.
[0024] The barbecue body 22 also includes a storage compartment 56. Storage doors 58a, 58b
provide access to the storage compartment 56 and include door handles 60a, 60b. The barbecue
body 22 further includes a drip tray 62 that is mounted within the storage compartment 52 below
the grill area 38. The drip tray 62 includes a tray handle 64.
[0025] As can be seen in Figs. 3A to 3C, the first spit support member 24 has a hollow part or
hollow body, which houses a spit drive system for driving rotation of the spit rod 34 when the
spit rod 34 is engaged with the first and second spit support members 24, 26 in a respective use
position. The spit drive system comprises a motor 66, a gear drive 68 and a power button 69.
The gear drive 68 includes a square socket opening therein. The first spit support member 24
also includes a latch mechanism located at a lower portion of the first spit support member 24.

                                                  6
The latch mechanism includes a double acting latch 70 with a spring-loaded arm 71. The
barbecue body 22 includes a catch 72 within the first opening 28. The second spit support
member 26 includes a similar latch mechanism. The second spit support member 26 also has a
hollow body, which houses an injection moulded plastic cradle support therein.
[0026] Referring to Figs. 4A and 4B, the first support member 24 includes a projecting knob or
pin 74. The barbecue body 22 includes a vertical slot or track 76, and three horizontal slots or
tracks 78, 80, 82 within the opening 28. The knob or pin 74 is adapted to slide along each of the
tracks or slots 76, 78, 80, 82. The second support member 26 includes identical components.
[0027] The functionality of the barbecue 20 will now be described.
[0028] Fig. 1 shows the barbecue 20 with the spit support members 24, 26 and the spit rod 34 in
a use configuration. The first and second support members 24 and 26 are in their respective use
positions, in which they protrude from the barbecue body 22. The spit rod 34 is mounted and
secured to an upper portion of the first and second spit support members 24 and 26 with one end
engaged with the square socket opening in the first support member 24 and the other end
engaged in the plastic cradle support in the second support member 26. The positions of the spit
forks 37a, 37b are adjustable along the length of the spit rod 34 so as to secure different types
and sizes of meat. The grill area 38 is located below the spit rod 34. The grill interior 40 is
adapted to receive charcoal or firewood to cook the meat on the spit rod 34, and the grill rack 42
prevents any meat that inadvertently falls off the spit rod 34 from entering the grill interior 40.
The grill rack 42 can also be used to cook smaller portions of meat separate from the spit rod 34.
The ventilation slots 44 allow for ventilation of air into and out of the barbecue body 22 to
promote or facilitate the burning of the charcoal or firewood in the grill interior 40.
[0029] The storage compartment 56 can be used to store the spit rod 34 and/or other barbecue
utensils or accessories, and is accessible from the front side of the barbecue 22 via the storage
doors 58a, 58b. The drip tray 62 holds any oils or fats that drip from the meat being cooked on
the spit rod 34.
[0030] Fig. 2 shows the barbecue 20 with the spit support members 24, 26 and the spit rod 34 in
a storage configuration. In this configuration, the first and second spit support members 24, 26

                                                    7
are retracted into their respective storage positions, in which they are substantially contained or
housed within the barbecue body 22. In this storage position, the top surfaces 25, 27 of the first
and second spit support members 24, 26 are substantially flush with the top surface 32 of the
barbecue body 22. The storage doors 50a, 50b are shut to securely contain the spit rod 34, the
drip tray 54 and other accessories within the storage compartment 48.
[0031] As will be described in more detail below, the first and second spit support members 24,
26 are moveable between their respective use and storage positions shown, thereby allowing the
barbecue 20 to be in either of the use or storage configurations described above. Additionally,
the first and second spit support members 24 and 26 may be positioned relative to the barbecue
body 22 at three different locations along their respective lengths so as to define three different
spit roasting heights. The movement of the first and second spit support members 24, 26 is
facilitated by the latch mechanism located within the respective first and second openings 28, 30.
[0032] Referring to Figs. 3A to 3C, the operation of the latch mechanism of the first support
member 24 is shown. In Fig. 3A, the first support member 24 is held in the storage position by
the spring-loaded arm 71 of the double acting latch 70 engaging the catch 72 of the barbecue
body 22. As shown in Fig. 3B, applying a downward force on the first support member 24
releases the spring-loaded arm 71 from the catch 72. This causes the first support member 24 to
pop-up from the barbecue body 22 into a gripable position, as shown in Fig. 3C. In this position,
the first support member 24 protrudes from the barbecue body 22 by approximately 13mm, and
this allows the user to grip the first support member 24 and pull it upwards into a use position.
[0033] Figs. 4A and 4B show the interaction between the knob 74 of the first support member 24
and the vertical and horizontal tracks or slots 76 and 82 of the barbecue body 22. Pulling the
first support member 24 upwards into the use position causes the knob or pin 74 to travel / slide
upwards along the vertical track or slot 76. Once the knob 74 is in a position adjacent the
horizontal track or slot 82, the user applies 1/6th of a turn to the first support member 24, which
causes the knob or pin 74 to slide into the horizontal track or slot 82. This sets the first support
member 24 at one of three spit roasting heights. Similarly, the first support member 24 can be
set at either of the other two spit roasting heights by sliding the knob 74 into horizontal tracks or
slots 78 or 80, respectively. The operation and movement of the second spit support member 26
are similar to the first spit support member 24.

                                                   8
[0034] Figs. 5A to 5C show the first support member 24 set at the three different spit roasting
heights, in which the knob 74 is positioned in horizontal tracks or slots 82, 80, 78, respectively.
[0035] The user thus sets the first and second support members 24 and 26 at a desired spit
roasting height. The meat to be cooked is then attached to the spit rod 34. The spit forks 37a
and 37b are adjusted along the length of the spit rod 34 to secure the meat therebetween. The
spit rod 34 is then mounted and secured to the first and second support members 24 and 26. The
user then presses the power button 69 to energise the motor 66 and the gear drive 68 of the spit
drive system. The spit rod 34 then rotates over the charcoal or firewood in the grill area 38,
allowing the meat to be cooked evenly.
[0036] Fig. 6 shows a second embodiment of a barbecue 120 with spit functionality, with the spit
support members 24, 26 in a use configuration. The barbecue 120 is in a table-top form and is
somewhat similar to the barbecue 20, with like reference numerals being used to indicate like
features. However, the barbecue body 22 has a height between about 200 to 225 mm, a length of
about 840 mm, and a width of about 460 mm. The legs 50 have a height of about 80 mm. The
barbecue body 22 has a smaller grill area 122 compared to the grill area 38. The grill area 122
includes a grill lid 124. The barbecue body 22 also includes a grill lid storage area 126 located
below the barbecue body 22. The storage compartment 56 is accessible by way of a storage
drawer 128, which includes a drawer handle 130.
[0037] Fig. 7 shows the barbecue 120 with the spit support members in a storage configuration.
The grill area 122 includes a table-top grill interior 132 and a table-top grill rack 134.
[0038] Fig. 8 shows a third embodiment of a barbecue 220 with spit functionality, with the spit
support members 24, 26 and the spit rod 34 in a use configuration. The barbecue 220 is
substantially identical to the table-top form of the barbecue 120, with like reference numerals
being used to indicate like features. However, the barbecue 220 includes a pedestal stand 222 to
support and elevate the barbecue body 22 from the ground. The pedestal stand 222 includes a
base 224. In this embodiment, the pedestal stand 222 has a height of about 592 mm, whilst the
barbecue body 22 has a height of about 232 mm, a length of about 730 mm and a width of about
410 mm. The barbecue 220 also includes power buttons 226a, 226b located on a side surface of
the barbecue body 22.

                                                   9
[0039] The barbecues described above have a number of advantages. Firstly, when the
barbecues are in their storage configurations, their various components are stored away inside
the barbecue body itself. This provides for a smaller, less bulky, and more visually appealing
form of a spit barbecue, which can also be used as an outdoor table for serving food and drinks.
Additionally, the various barbecue components are maintained in a "ready to use" state, and can
thus easily be assembled, which reduces the time and effort that is normally required to set up a
spit barbecue. When the barbecues are in their use configurations, the spit support members and
spit forks are adjustable to different heights and lengths to suit the type and size of meat that is
being cooked. The barbecue body also has handles and legs fitted with wheels, which allows a
user to easily transport the barbecue from one location to another.
[0040] Although the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, it
will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many
other forms. For example, in another embodiment (not shown) the barbecue body has a height of
approximately 400 mm, a length of approximately 1545 mm, and a width of 500 mm.
