   disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.
   It is an object of the technology in a preferred form to provide a polymer bracket.
15 SUMMARY OF THE TECHNOLOGY
   According to an aspect of the technology, there is provided a bracket, the bracket
   including:
         an elongate upper surface for providing support to an object, the upper surface
         having a first end and a second end;
                                                 1

        a mounting element is located about the first end of the upper surface; the
        mounting element extends beneath, and substantially perpendicular to, the
        upper surface;
        a pair of brace elements extend beneath the upper surface to a lower portion of
 5      the mounting element.
   Preferably, the bracket is a polymer bracket, or comprised primarily of a polymeric
   material. The polymer is preferably resilient and/or rigid and/or fire resistant. Most
   preferably, the bracket is integrally formed.
   Preferably, the upper surface is perforated. More preferably, the upper surface
10 defines an elongated rectangle having an array of through slots that are formed along
   the upper surface.
   Preferably, the upper surface has side edges that each form an overhanging lip.
   Preferably, the pair of brace elements are each in the form for a triangular side
   element. More preferably the triangular side elements are spaced apart and
15 substantially parallel.
   Preferably a triangular side element are perforated with an array of circular
   openings. More preferably, a long edge of each triangular side element is reinforced
   with an integral stiffening rib. Typically, the long edge extends between the
   mounting element and the underside of the upper surface about its distal tip at the
20 second end. Most preferably, the long edge also defines a bead for forming a channel
   between the bead and the stiffening rib.
   Alternatively, the pair of brace elements are each preferably in the form for a bracing
   arm. More preferably the bracing arms are spaced apart and substantially parallel.
                                                2

   Typically, the bracing arm extends between the mounting element and the underside
   of the upper surface about its distal tip at the second end. More preferably, each
   bracing arm is reinforced with an integral stiffening rib. Most preferably, each
   bracing arm also defines a bead for forming a channel between the bead and the
 5 stiffening rib.
   Preferably, the mounting element extends from the lower portion of the bracing
   elements to a location vertically above the upper surface. More preferably, the
   mounting element forms an extension above the level of the upper surface through
   which is formed an uppermost mounting through hole. Most preferably, one or more
10 mounting openings are located in mounting element that can be accessed between
   the bracing elements.

20 BEST MODE AND OTHER EMBODIMENTS
                                                 3

   As shown in FIG. 1, a polymeric wall bracket 100 has an upper surface 101 for
   supporting pipes, lines, wires, cables and the like. The polymer is preferably
   resilient, rigid, fire resistant and safe for use in hazardous environments and
   enclosed spaces. In this example, the upper surface        101 forms an elongated rectangle
 5 having an array of through slots     102 aligned along a longitudinal centre line of the
   upper surface. In this example there are four equally spaced slots. The slots may be
   used to retain fasteners, fixtures or accessories that compliment the utility of the
   bracket. The upper surface forms an overhanging lip         103 with respect to the integral
   sides  104.  In the example of FIG. 1, each of the two sides is triangular and perforated
10 with an array of three circular openings 105 of different sizes. The openings 105
   increase the versatility of uses that the bracket may be applied to and reduce weight.
   In this example, each side is triangular and the long side of the triangle is reinforced
   with an integral stiffening rib 106. The long edge of the triangular side also features
   a bead   107 along the long edge, forming a channel 108 between the bead or lip         107
15 and the stiffening rib 106. In this example, the long edge of the triangle       109 extends
   between an integral mounting plate       11o and the underside of the upper surface at its
   distal tip 11.
   The backing plate portion or mounting "plate" 11o extends from the lower corner of
   the long edge    112 to a location 113 vertically above the upper surface   101.   Thus, the
20 plate forms an extension      114 above the level of the upper surface through which may
   be located an uppermost mounting through hole          115. Although the sides are
   conceptually connected at their upper extremes by the upper surface          101  and across
   their rear edges by the backing plate, the long edges      109 of the sides are not
   interconnected. Thus, the bracket forms a channel having an open bottom through
                                                   4

   which the interior and any mounting openings or features located in the interior can
   be easily accessed.
   As shown in FIG. 2, the plate portion      110 comprises a perimeter     200   that is
   subdivided by stiffening ribs     201. In this example, the plate provides two through
 5 mounting openings       115, 202, each opening rigidised by radially extending ribs       203.
   From FIG.    2 it can be seen that the rigidising rib 106 extends from the plate       110 to a
   location  204   adjacent to the upper surface    101.
   As shown in FIG. 3, the overhanging lip       103 provides an underside 301 that can be
   engaged by clamps and other mounting fixtures. In preferred embodiments, the
10 upper surface    101  is perpendicular to the rear surface   302  of the plate or plate
   portion 11o.
   FIG. 4 illustrates a front view of the bracket depicted in FIG. 1. Because there is no
   material connecting the long edges of the triangular sides, the interior forms an open
   sided interior compartment 40o. Thus, the interior compartment 400 can be
15 accessed through the open long side, through the circular or other openings            105  and
   through the slots    102.  A mounting hole 401 located in the compartment and below
   the upper surface     101.  Because one of the mounting openings       115 is external to the
   compartment 400, it is easier to mount the bracket than when the only mounting
   openings are below the upper surface or within the interior compartment of a double
20 sided bracket.
   In the example of FIG. 5, instead of having triangular and reinforcing sides, the
   bracket may be provided with fully open sides         500. In this example, the upper
   surface  101  and its lip  103 may be supported by a relatively narrow and integral brace
   501 on each side. In this example, the braces comprises a channel 502 defined by
                                                   5

   two ribs 503, 504, that form between them, a channel 505. This style of bracket
   provides the maximum accessibility through the open sides. It will be understood
   that the through opening between the upper surface, brace and plate 11o can be
   subdivided, reinforced and utilised in a number of ways.
