   CONTROLLED RELEASE COMPOSITIONS AND THEIR METHODS OF USE
   TECHNICAL FIELD
   This invention relates to controlled release compositions and their method of use,
 5 and preferably, but not specifically, to low viscosity controlled release compositions
   for the treatment of mastitis in lactating animals.
   BACKGROUND ART
   In order to treat lactating animals with mastitis or another microbial infection,
   antibiotic compositions are most often utilised. There are a number of
10 commercially available antibiotic compositions used for intramammary mastitis
   treatment during the lactation period.
   However, one of the major problems encountered with antibiotic treatments is a
   poor controlled release of the active agent over the treatment period. This can
   lead to problems with maintaining the active agent concentrations above the
15 minimum inhibitory concentration wherein 90% of the microbes are killed (termed
   the MIC90). For instance, if the antibiotic is released too quickly, the antibiotic can
   come out with the first milking after administration. Then, the concentration of the
   antibiotic can be too low for the remaining period before receiving the subsequent
    administration, often 12 hours later. This can lead to failures in effectively treating
20  the infection, longer treatment periods, and/or ultimately increased resistance
    against antibiotics.
    To counter these problems, compositions such as NitroCloxTM (Long Acting) LA
    and OrbeninTM LA are often designed to have a higher viscosity, a known
    technique to slow the release profile of an active agent from a composition.
25  Indeed, this is the approach taken for lactation and dry cow mastitis therapy known
    as long acting formulations, where the active is slowly released from a generally
                                               2

   thick paste over an extended period of time. For instance, if the antibiotic gets
   administered 48 hourly during the lactation period, the antibiotic is released slowly
   with concentrations above MIC90 for about 36 hours after treatment. Then, the
   concentrations of the antibiotic are too low for the remaining period before
 5 receiving the subsequent administration, often 12 hours later. Again, this can lead
   to failures in effectively treating the infection.
   Further reasons why chemists develop high viscosity compositions are because it
   can enhance the physical stability of the composition.
   However, in the treatment of many conditions such as mastitis during the lactation
10 period, a higher viscosity can lead to other problems. For example, high viscosity
   can lead to prolonged low levels of antibiotics in the milk and such milk must be
   withheld from the market. A long with-holding period (WHP) leads to lost revenue.
   Also, a higher viscosity composition requires more force for infusion or injection of
   a formulation. This can lead to problems associated with increased difficulty with
15  infusion (herein referred to as injectability) through a syringe to the udder.
    For mastitis treatment, a higher viscosity of the composition can also lead to poorer
   distribution in the udder.
   The need for thickeners or other excipients to increase viscosity of the
    compositions can also make the manufacturing process more time consuming and
20  costly. Also, it is generally understood in the industry that the higher the viscosity of
    the composition, the more difficult it can be to handle during the manufacturing
    process.
    A further problem that can be encountered with many suspensions used for
    mastitis treatment compositions is sedimentation of the suspension during storage.
25  Of course, a higher viscosity of a composition can help to stabilise physically the
                                                  3

   suspension but a higher viscosity can not usually prevent sedimentation, it only
   slows the sedimentation. Consequently, even viscous suspensions will eventually
   sediment and the sediment may then cake, often proving difficult to re-disperse
   prior to administration. A high viscosity composition can hinder the re-dispersability
 5 of the sediments.
   Therefore, there is a long felt need in the industry to develop improved
   compositions for the treatment of conditions such as mastitis during the lactating
   period of an animal. In the case of mastitis treatment, desired traits of such a
   composition may include:
10       -  controllable release profile of the active agent;
         -  a short with-holding period (WHP) - for example, for treatment of conditions
             such as mastitis during the lactation period of the animal;
         -   good re-dispersability after storage, or before administration;
         -   ease of injectability or other mode of administration;
15       -   good distribution of the composition into the region to be treated;
         -   the composition's base being adaptable to use with different active agents
             for treating or preventing any disease or condition, yet controlled and/or
             sustained release of the active;
          -  the composition's base being adaptable to account for different treatment
20            regimes (i.e. different controlled release profiles); and / or
          -  easy to manufacture, and using pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.
    It is an object of the present invention to address the foregoing problems or at least
    to provide the public with a useful choice.

   DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION
   According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a composition,
   the composition including a therapeutically effective amount of an active agent or
   active agents, and
20 a base including,
   an amount of colloidal silica
   at least one oil; and
    at least one surfactant,

   wherein the viscosity of the composition is below 1000 mPas at a shear rate of
   100 1/s and at a temperature of 200C.
   The inventors surprisingly found that the composition was particularly effective in
   the case of mastitis treatment as it may help to provide:
 5       -  a controllable release profile of the active agent, for instance which may be
             used to maintain active agent concentrations above MIC90 during the
             treatment period;
         -   a low viscosity to help with injectability, re-dispersability and/or good
             distribution in the udder, and/or
10       -   a shorter WHP compared to other currently available mastitis compositions.
   As will be discussed further, the inventors have recognised the particular
    importance of this invention to antibiotic treatment of mastitis. However, it would
    be reasonably expected by someone skilled in the art that the same inventive
    concept of the disclosed composition would apply to a controllable release profile
15  of substantially any active agent or compound in need thereof for treatment of
    other conditions.
    Without wishing to being limited to a mode of action, it is believed that this
    controllable release may be due to the surfactant interacting with the colloidal
    silica, with the result being a change in the release profile of the active agent from
20  the composition.
    Importantly this control of the release profile of the active agent may be achieved
    without overly altering the viscosity of the composition, and in particular without a
    substantial increase in the composition's viscosity.
                                                 R

   By example in Figure 2, in vitro studies showed the inventors were able to
   decrease drug recovery (equating to a decreased release profile in vivo) in
   dissolution media from approximately 50% to 5% w/w over a 180 minute time
   period. This beneficial effect was obtainable while the viscosity of the composition
 5 only increased marginally from 90 mPas to 118 mPas (at a shear rate of 100 1/s at
   a temperature of 200C). As shown in Figure 2, this recovery rate of 5% w/w was
   similar to that obtained by a competing product, OrbeninTM LA. However,
   Orbenin TM LA has a viscosity of 1080 mPas, approximately 10 fold of that seen in
   this example in the present invention.
10 Obviously, if the need arises for a higher viscosity composition, this can be
   achieved by using thickeners as well known in the art.
   For example, when treating mastitis during the lactation period, a lower viscosity
   composition may be achieved which helps to provide numerous advantageous
   features such as easy re-dispersability, injectability, manufacturing and/or a shorter
15 WHP. Such features may be provided whilst altering the release profile of the
   composition's active agent to suit the requirements desired. In the treatment of
   mastitis for example, this controlled release may be used to ensure the active
   agent is kept above the MIC90 during the entire treatment period.
   The inventors have conducted preliminary trials as exemplified herein which
20 illustrates the significant advantages.
    Preferred embodiments of the composition
   Active agent
    Preferably, the active agent is an antibiotic, a combination of antibiotics or an
   antibiotic combined with a non-antibiotic active agent. The inventors acknowledge
25 a preferred antibiotic is cloxacillin due to its effectiveness in treating mastitis.
                                                7

   Preferably, the cloxacillin is given as cloxacillin sodium. Of course, other forms of
   cloxacillin, such as cloxacillin benzathine, may also be used.
   Other preferred active agents include beta-lactams, penicillins, cephalosporins,
   aminoglycosides, quinolones, fosfomycin, sulphonamides, tetracyclines and
 5 macrolide antibiotics.
   Preferred combinations of active agents include amoxicillin and clavulanic acid;
   penicillin active agent and aminoglycoside; cloxacillin and tylosin; and an antibiotic
   and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.
   However, substantially any antibiotic, non-antibiotic active agent, or functional
10 derivatives thereof may be utilised in the present invention.
   For example, the inventors have exemplified that the invention also works in a
   similar fashion when the active agent is a tylosin base, cephapirin sodium or
   cephapirin benzathine antibiotic.
   It was also surprising to find that the release rate can be affected depending on the
15 type of active agent used. When the type/amount of silica and surfactant is kept
   constant, altering the active agent from cephapirin and cloxacillin (both kept at a
   concentration of approximately 4.5% w/w) resulted in a very different release rate.
   Cephapirin was released much slower than cloxacillin. This illustrates that by
   adjusting the type and possibly the concentration of active agent (and if appropriate
20 the silica and surfactant), a desired release of substantially any active agent may
    be achieved.
    Preferably, the active agent is micronised. The term micronised should be taken
   as meaning a particle with a mass mean diameter d50 between to 1 - 20 pm
    Micronisation helps to reduce sedimentation velocity. Furthermore, larger particles
25  may form bridges in front of the syringe nozzle which may affect syringeability.

   Throughout this specification, the term injectability or syringeability should be taken
   as meaning the ease of administering the medicament to the animal through a
   syringe. This is typically affected by viscosity, as well as the particle size of the
   drugs or formulation excipients, which can sometimes partially or fully block the tip
 5 of the syringe path during administration of the medicament.
   Colloidal silica
   Throughout this specification the term colloidal silica should be taken as meaning
   particles of fumed amorphous silica with a greatest diameter of a single silica
   particle between approximately 1 nm and 1000 nm (1 pm).
10 A further discussion on the known traits and uses of colloidal silica is provided later
   in this specification. This helps to illustrate that the present use of colloidal silica is
   very different to the previously known uses as a thickening and/or anti-caking
   agent.
   Preferably, the colloidal silica is fumed colloidal silicon dioxide.
15 Many different types of fumed colloidal silica are currently available. A person
   skilled in the art would appreciate that all currently available and future types of
   fumed colloidal silica would provide the same advantages as discussed herein. As
   exemplified in this specification, fumed colloidal silicon dioxide was found to be
    particularly effective.
20  Preferably, the fumed colloidal silica has hydrophobic properties.
   The inventors identified hydrophobic colloidal silica may be significantly more
    effective than hydrophilic colloidal silica at altering the release profile of the active
    agent, whilst keeping the viscosity relatively low and/or substantially unchanged.

   This was a surprising result as formulations using hydrophobic colloidal silica have
   a lower viscosity than those using its hydrophilic counter-part. Hydrophilic colloidal
   silica is known to be used as a thickening agent, which imparts a slower release
   profile as result of the thickened composition.
 5 Instead, when the inventors used hydrophilic silica, inclusion of a surfactant tended
   to increase the viscosity of the composition more than when compared to using
   hydrophobic silica. This was a particularly surprising result, as the use of
   hydrophobic silica instead of hydrophilic silica in the present invention tended to
   provide a greater control of the active agent's release.
10 A preferred commercially available hydrophobic colloidal silicon dioxide is Aerosil*
   R972 (supplied by Aerosil).
   Preferably, the concentration of colloidal silica is between 0.1-5% w/w. This
   amount was found to be particularly effective when used in a treatment of mastitis
   during the lactation period, as per the preferred dosage regimes discussed herein.
15  More preferably, the concentration of colloidal silica is between 1-3% w/w. A
    particularly preferred amount of colloidal silica was in the order of 1.75% w/w. For
    example, this was found to allow suitable release of the active over the treatment
    period (typically 24 hours) to maintain the cloxacillin above the MIC90, yet
    simultaneously provided a beneficially shorter WHP than competing reference
20  products. This is just one example of how the controlled release mechanism of the
    present invention may be effectively utilised.
    As discussed above, the amount of colloidal silica used may be governed partially
    by the type of active used, and the desired release rate. For example, cephapirin
    is shown to release considerably slower from the base of the composition than
25  cloxacillin.
                                               in

   For this reason, one may decide to lower the amount of colloidal silica to achieve a
   similar release rate to that provided when using cloxacillin if so desired.
   In-vivo protocols are well known in the industry and provide a straightforward test
   to determine the resulting active agent concentration in milk from a given
 5 composition. From such studies, a person skilled in the art would be able to easily
   adjust the amount of colloidal silica (or for that matter the active, or amount/type of
   surfactant) to achieve the desired release rate of substantially any composition.
   Overall, it was found by the inventors that the higher the concentration of colloidal
   silica in the base of the composition, the slower the release rate of the active
10 agent. Importantly, this slowed release rate may be achieved without overly
   affecting the viscosity of the compositions. In competing compositions, such as
   NitroCloxTM LA or OrbeninTM LA, a similar release rate can only be achieved
   through a much higher viscosity, which has numerous disadvantages as discussed.
   Surfactant
15 Throughout this specification the term surfactant should be taken as meaning any
   compound that lowers the surface tension of a liquid, any compound that lowers
   the interfacial tension between two liquids, or any compound that lowers the
    interfacial tension between a liquid and a solid. Surfactants may also act as
   emulsifiers, detergents, wetting agents and so forth.
20  Preferably, the surfactant is a non-ionic surfactant.
    However, the inventors consider amphoteric, anionic or cationic surfactants should
   work as well.
    Preferably, the non-ionic surfactant has a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB)
    range between 0.5 and 30.
                                               11

   More preferably, the non-ionic surfactant has a HLB range between 4 and 16.
   More preferably, the surfactant is chosen from the group selected from sorbitan
   esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene castor oil
   derivatives, polyoxyethylene stearates, and polyethylene oxide monooleate, and
 5 combinations thereof.
   Surprisingly, some surfactants appeared to work better than others at controlling a
   chosen active agent's release rate.
   For example, 0.1% w/w PEG12-oleate had a greater effect at slowing the release
   rate of cloxacillin than 0.1% w/w Span 80, while all other variables were kept
10 constant.
   Preferably, the surfactant is at a concentration between 0.01 to 10% w/w.
   The inventors found that the more surfactant in the base of the composition, the
   slower the release rate of the active agent.
   For this reason, the amount/type of the surfactant and/or the ratio of surfactant to
15 colloidal silica may provide a means to control the release rate of the active agent.
   Preferably, the ratio of colloidal silica to surfactant is between 1:100 and 500:1.
   Most preferably, the ratio of colloidal silica to surfactant is between 1:5 and 6:1.
   Optionally, the base may include more than one type of surfactant.       It would be
   reasonable to expect that the resulting composition's release profile (and other
20 characteristics such as WHP) may be more finely controlled by using a
   combination of surfactants in a single composition, and/or in different compositions
   administered during the course of treatment.
                                                 19

   Oil
   In many compositions, oils are needed as a vehicle. For example, antibiotic
   compositions including actives such as cloxacillin or cephapirin are typically based
   on an oily vehicle. For example, this helps the composition to be administered as
 5 an infusion through the teat canal or an injection and/or achieving sufficient
   chemical stability during its shelf life.
   Preferably, the oil has a low viscosity.
   The use of a low viscosity oil helps to ensure the resulting composition retains a
   low viscosity. This may help ensure the composition has good distribution within
10 the udder, is easy to re-disperse after storage, and is easy to administer through a
   syringe.
   Preferably, the viscosity of the oil is between 1 and 100 mPas at 20"C.
   More preferably, the viscosity of the oil is less than 40mPas at 200C.
    More preferably, the oil is selected from the group consisting of medium chain
15 triglycerides (eg Miglyol 812 or Miglyol 840), ethyl oleate, light liquid paraffin,
   sesame oil and peanut oil. However, it should be appreciated that other similar low
   viscosity oils may be utilised for the present invention.
                                                                         3
    Preferably, the oil has a low density between 0.80 and 0.99 g/cm
   As exemplified in Figure 6, the inventors found that different oils used altered the
20  recovery rate of the active agent. The effect was not as pronounced when
    compared to alterations in the type/amount of surfactant, colloidal silica or active
    agent used. Therefore, it is possible such changes may be due simply to the
    viscosity of the oil, and that of the resulting composition. Therefore, in a preferred
                                                 13

   embodiment, a lower viscosity oil is used to maintain a lower viscosity of the
   composition.
   Yet, the inventors also consider that the oil may be interacting with one or more of
   the components in the base of the composition to affect the recovery rate of the
 5 active agent in a separate manner to just viscosity-related controlled release.
   Viscosity of the final composition
   Obviously, the viscosity of the composition may be tailored to the specific
   requirements needed. For some compositions, a relatively high viscosity may be
   used. In others, a low viscosity may be maintained by not adding excipients such
10 as thickeners or high viscosity oils. Such viscosity modifiers may also contribute, if
   necessary, to the release profile of the active.
   The preferred viscosity ranges and values discussed below are those which the
   inventors have found to be particularly beneficial for the intramammary treatment of
   mastitis during the lactation period.
15  Unless specified otherwise, viscosities of the composition referred to within this
   specification are based on measurements using a concentric cylinder method at a
   shear rate of 100 1/s and at a temperature of 20 0 C. The viscosity of the
    compositions according to the present invention are below 1000 mPas when
    measured at these conditions.
20  More preferably, the final composition has a viscosity below 300 mPas.
    Most preferably, the composition has a viscosity below 150 mPas.
    NitroCloxTM LA and OrbeninTM LA have a viscosity above 1000 mPas at a shear
    rate of 100 1/s and a temperature of 200C. Similarly, dry cow mastitis treatments
                                              14

   or other compositions which include colloidal silica typically have a viscosity well
   above this upper limit.
   The inventors identified that a composition for the treatment of mastitis during the
   lactation period preferably has a viscosity below 1000 mPas (and more preferably
 5 below 300 mPas) may provide better characteristics in terms of good syringeability,
   re-dispersability, udder distribution and/or short WHP when compared to
   competing compositions such as NitroCloxTM LA and OrbeninTM LA. These
   beneficial features may be retained whilst ensuring the release profile of the active
   is suitably controlled to allow the active to maintain substantially above the MIC90
10 during the entire treatment period.
   Preferred method of treatment
    Preferably, the composition described herein is used to treat mastitis as an
    intramammary infusion during the lactation period.
    In the case of mastitis arising during the lactation period, the composition may be
15  used in bovine, ovine or other animals typically used for commercial milk
    production.
    This helps to differentiate the preferred use of the present invention from dry period
    mastitis treatment (i.e. treatment outside the lactation period).
    Yet, it is clear that the present invention may be used to treat substantially any
20  condition or disease depending on the active agent selected. The underlying
    inventive concept of the composition should not be limited to compositions for
    intramammary treatment of mastitis.
    According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of
    treating a microbial infection in an animal in need thereof with a composition as
                                                1S

   substantially described herein wherein the method includes the step of
   administering the composition by intramammary infusion.
   The method of administering the composition may typically be through infusion
   through the teat canal.
 5 Preferably, the method includes a dosage regime of between 1 - 12 doses of 1-10
   g composition with a treatment regime of administration every 12, 24 or 48 hours.
   More preferably, the method includes a dosage regime of 3 or 6 doses of 5 g
   composition with a treatment regime of 24 hours over a treatment period of 48
   hours (3 doses) to 120 hours (6 doses).
10 This dosage regime may be sufficient to successfully treat an animal with pre
   clinical or clinical mastitis during the lactation period.
   After the calculated WHP, normal milking production can resume again. Again, the
   inventors found the WHP of the present invention may be substantially lower than
   other currently available formulations, such as NitroCloxTM LA when the same
15 treatment periods were compared.
    Figure 14 exemplifies one composition of the present invention having a WHP of
   72 hours compared to NitroCloxTM LA with a WHP of 108 hours (treatment regime
   three doses at 24h intervals). Based on the assumptions in the paragraph below,
   this would equate to an increased profit of $24 per cow due to a 36 hour shorter
20 WHP. When this is multiplied over a large dairy farm, or indeed an entire nation,
    one can easily see the importance of this invention.
    The increased profit of $24 per cow assumes what is generally understood in the
    New Zealand dairy industry, as outlined below. Each milking typically provides
    approximately 10 L of milk (equalling 1kg of milk solids), and a farmer sells 1 kg of

   milk solids for $8 to a company such as Fonterra. Furthermore, each cow will
   typically be milked every 12 hours.
   A particularly advantageous use of the present invention may be the combination
   treatments of different compositions having different release profiles during the
 5 treatment period.
   To illustrate this, a mastitis treatment may encompass the initial use of a relatively
   slow active-releasing composition over the first part of the treatment period, yet the
   latter treatment(s) may use a faster active-releasing composition.
   This may help in the sense that fewer treatments may be required towards the
10 beginning of the treatment period. It may also help to ensure the active is kept
   above the MIC90. Towards the end of the treatment period, a faster releasing
   composition may be used essentially to top up the active agent levels. Yet,
    because the active is released faster, the WHP period may still be kept shorter.
    Preferred method of manufacture
15 According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of
    manufacturing the composition as substantially described above including the
    steps of:
        a) mixing the oil and surfactant in a container to form a homogenous oil
             mixture;
20      b) dispersing the active agent in the oil mixture; and
        c) subsequently adding the colloidal silica to the oil mixture.
    Optionally, at least one preservative is mixed in with the oil and surfactant in step
    a). For example, methyl paraben and propyl paraben may be used as
    preservatives.
                                              17

   Preferably, the oil mixture formed from step a) is heat sterilised. For example, the
   inventors utilise a three hour incubation at 140'C, and then subsequently allow the
   mixture to cool.
   Preferably, step b) and step c) utilise high shear dispersion equipment.
 5 Preferably, the colloidal silica in step c) is also heat sterilised before being added to
   the oil mixture.
   Preferably, the oil mixture formed after step c) is homogenously mixed.
   The inventors identified that the composition's preferred low viscosity also helps
   with the manufacturing process. Unlike other compositions, there is no extra
10 heating step required to mix in a thickener (e.g. hydroxystearin).
   Also, the lower viscosity may help when syringes need to be filled after
   manufacturing the composition and prior to administration.
   The preferred use of micronised active agents also helps to prevent quick settling
   of the composition. Additionally, the inventors consider it possible that the release
15 of a micronised active is easier to control than non-micronised equivalents,
    potentially because the particle size distribution is likely more consistent. Also, it is
    possible that any interaction with other components from within the composition is
    likely to be enhanced with the larger surface area of the smaller micronised
    particles.
20  Additional background of colloidal silica
    Fumed colloidal silica, such as colloidal silicon dioxide, is typically used as viscosity
    modifiers, and more particularly, thickening agents in liquid formulations. Some
    examples of how colloidal silica has been used follows. In line with what was
    commonly understood in the art, colloidal silica was known to aid in altering the

   release of actives from a composition, but only in the sense of it acting as a
   thickener. As discussed before, generally the thicker a composition becomes, the
   slower the release profile of the active is, and vice versa. This is an entirely
   different concept from the present invention.
 5 NZ523128 discloses a veterinary drench product including an active dissolved in a
   solvent then adsorbed on a sorbing medium such as Aerosil R972 fumed silica,
   then dispersing the solvent into another liquid that contains another active
   dissolved or suspended therein.
   WO 03070155 discloses a formulation for oral administration including an active
10 agent suspended in an oily matrix, with surfactant and colloidal silicon dioxide. The
   composition is made into a viscous solution with the addition of hydrogenated
   vegetable oil, including yellow beeswax as a suspending agent, lecithin. Silicon
   dioxide is used as a dispersion aid and pseudoephedrine HCI, for use in a gelatin
   capsule.
15 W00160409 discloses a paste formulation including an active agent, fumed silica,
   a viscosity modifier, an absorbent, a colourant, and a carrier. The viscosity modifier
    includes PEG 200-600, monoethylamine, glycerol, and propylene glycol.
   W09824436 discloses a gel formulation including colloidal silicon dioxide and
   triacetin.
20  JP 3153623 (based on English translation of Abstract) discloses a semisolid
    pharmaceutical composition for oral administration.      The composition includes a
    drug, a physiologically permissible liquid, an edible oil, a colloidal silicon dioxide,
    aluminum stearate or a high-molecular weight polyethylene glycol.
    US 4980175 discloses a liquid compositions for oral administration, including
25  antacid   ingredient (aluminium    hydroxide etc.) and       colloidal silicon dioxide
                                               1AQ

   suspended in medium chain triglycerides. An emulsifier (hexaglycerol monoleate)
   is included to reduce the taste of the oil.
   US 4781920 discloses an anthelmintic paste including mineral oil, polysorbate 20
   surfactant, fumed silica and tetramisole resinate.
 5 These documents do not disclose that the combination of the components (and in
   particular the surfactant and the colloidal silica) would interact to provide a
   controlled release mechanism of the active agent.           Furthermore, those that do
   include both surfactant and a colloidal silica are described as viscous liquid
   compositions or pastes which would not fall within the scope of the present
10 invention (a composition with a viscosity below 1000 mPas). The colloidal silica
   used in such compositions are typically used as viscosity modifiers (thickeners) to
   directly impart a controlled release.
   In other instances, fumed colloidal silica is used for tablet or powder formulations
   as a free-flow agent. AEROSIL discusses other typical applications of colloidal
15 silica on their website, such as anti-caking and a stabiliser (www.aerosll.com).
   Fumed colloidal silica exists in particles (termed primary, secondary or tertiary
   particles depending on their level of aggregation and/or agglomeration).
    Under mechanical stress, the silica tertiary structure is broken down to primary or
   secondary aggregates, the system becomes more fluid, and the viscosity drops.
20 Once returning to rest, the tertiary structure of agglomerated silica particles builds
    up again, and the viscosity returns to its original value.
   As stated in the Technical Information 1279, Aerosil, Degussa, hydrophobic
   AEROSIL* ("R") grades have been treated during manufacture to obtain a
    hydrophobic surface. During this process, silanol groups are reacted. Interestingly,
                                               90

   hydrophobic AEROSIL@ types often exhibit lower thickening efficiency compared
   to hydrophilic types.
   Therefore for liquid dosage forms, hydrophilic fumed silica is recommended for
   viscosity control and therefore slower active agent release and hydrophobic fumed
 5 silica is recommended for stabilisation to prevent hard sediments (i.e. caking) from
   forming, particularly during storage (www.aerosil.com).
   The general principle as employed in formulation chemistry is: an increase of
   thickening agent concentration in a formulation, the greater the viscosity, and the
   slower the active agent release from the resulting formulation.
10 Therefore it was surprising to find that altering the components of the present
   composition substantially influences the release profile of the active agent without
   overly affecting the viscosity. This is clearly exemplified the examples provided in
   this specification.
   As exemplified in FigurelO, cloxacillin release from a preferred composition can be
15 finely controlled and extended with concentrations in milk above MIC90=0.5mg/L
   (for Cloxacillin in New Zealand, number taken from Salomon et al, 1998 J Dairy Sci
   81:570-578) for more than 48 hours after treatment (example 17). This can not be
   achieved with current products in the market with a treatment regime of 48 hours,
                       TM
   such as NitroClox      LA (Figure 13) and Orbenin TM LA (Figure 15) even though the
20 viscosity is much higher in comparison.
   Colloidal silica has been employed in the Orbenin TM LA formulation manufactured
   by Pfizer, yet only for conventional uses, such as a thickener and/or anti-caking
   agent. A further thickener, hydroxystearin, is added with the colloidal silica to
   increase the formulation's viscosity which is used to achieve a slow release of the
25 active agent. There is no inclusion of a surfactant in the Orbenin TM LA formulation,
   unlike the present invention.
                                               91

   As a result of the thickener used in the OrbeninTM LA composition, it has a much
   higher viscosity than that achieved by the present invention (as outlined in the
   examples). As previously discussed, this can lead to problems with injectability.
   Therefore, the inventors consider the present invention, which is able to achieve a
 5 lower viscosity whilst being able to control active agent release effectively, has
   significant advantages over OrbeninTM LA.
   WO 87/03876 also discloses a treatment/prevention formulation for mastitis during
   the dry period. WO 87/03876 discusses the use of colloidal silica together with the
   addition of further thickeners in order to provide a viscous formulation. Again, the
10 result of this highly viscous formulation is to provide a controlled release of the
   active over a longer treatment period (during the dry period opposed to lactating
    period). This is different to the use of colloidal silica in the present invention.
   WO 03/063877 also discloses the use of colloidal silica for mastitis treatment
    during the dry period. Again, the aim is to provide a high viscosity formulation
15  using colloidal silica as a thickener for slow release of the antibiotic.
    US 4,401,674 discloses an intramammary formulation containing penicillin and a
    molecular sieve. Colloidal silica is different to molecular sieves. Molecular sieves
    are typically a few microns (pm) in diameter making them considerably larger than
    colloidal silica particles. Unlike colloidal silica, molecular sieves do not have
20  thickening properties and, as such, are not typically used as thickening agents.
    Column 1, line 54 to 58 of US 4,401,674 discusses that if the formulation is to be
    used for lactating cows, an emulsifying agent (or alternatively a coconut oil) may be
    added into the composition to "hasten the mixing of the composition with the
    aqueous secretions in the udder." This is quite different to the concept of the
25   present invention, where the surfactant appears to be chemically interacting with
    the silica structure to impart a change in the release rate. For example, the release
                                                 22

   rate of the active agent is slowed down with increasing surfactant concentration.
   Depending on the type/amount of surfactant, silica and/or active agent, the release
   rate of the active agent from the composition may be altered, and importantly
   without overly affecting viscosity.
 5 Also, US 4,401,674 does not disclose or teach that an emulsifying agent would
   alter the release rate of the active agent. It merely is provided to hasten the mixing
   of the composition.

  PART 2: Exemplification of controlled release rate of active a-gent
5 Figure 1 illustrates the comparatively low viscosity of the preferred composition of
  the present invention compared to reference products currently on the market.
                                               28

   Recovery rates in dissolution media (shown in Figures 2-6) are considered by the
   inventors to be indicative of in vivo release rates.
   Figure 2 clearly illustrates one of the major advantages of the present invention.
   Compared to OrbeninTM LA, the two test compositions in Figure 2 have very low
 5 viscosity (90-150 mPas vs 1080 mPas). Orbenin TM LA is able to maintain a
   relatively slow cloxacillin release (approximately 5%) by using a thickener
   (hydroxystearin). This viscosity of Orbenin Tm LA compared to the current
   compositions can be visualised in Figure 1.
   The two test compositions depicted in Figure 2 do not include a thickener to impart
10 a slow recovery profile. Instead, careful selection of the surfactant (Span80 vs.
   PEG1 2-oleate) can be used to significantly alter the recovery profile of the
   cloxacillin without a significant rise in the viscosity. The test composition containing
   PEG12-oleate has a recovery profile substantially identical (if not slower) than
   OrbeninTM LA, yet the viscosity beneficially remains relatively low (180 mPas).
15 Figure 3 illustrates that the recovery rate of the active agent can be affected not
   only by the choice of the surfactant type, but also the concentration thereof. This is
   exemplified by the increase of the concentration of Span80 (HLB=4.3) from 0.05%
   to 1% (Examples 8 to 11). Only a small rise in the viscosity is seen, yet a
   disproportionate decrease in the active recovery is provided.
20  Similarly, alteration of the concentration of PEG12-Oleate (HLB=13.7) (Examples 6
    and 7) is shown, with corresponding changes in the recovery profile.         Therefore,
   this illustrates that different types and concentrations of surfactants may be used to
    control the release profile of compositions in vivo.
    Figure 4 illustrates that the concentration of colloidal silica also affected recovery
25  rates of the active agent. It was found that as the concentration of colloidal silica
                                                 29

   (in this case Aerosil R972) increased from 1.75% to 3% w/w, the recovery rate was
   lowered.
   Again, although the recovery profile slowed dramatically as the silica concentration
   increased from 1.75 to 3%, the viscosity only increased slightly from 90 mPas to
 5 127 mPas.
   Figure 5 illustrates that the type of colloidal silica may also affect the recovery rate
   of the active agent. Here, hydrophobic colloidal silica (Aerosil R972) is shown to
   significantly lower the recovery rate compared to hydrophilic colloidal silica (Aerosil
   200). This is despite the hydrophobic silica imparting a lower viscosity on the
10 composition compared to the same composition using hydrophilic silica. This is
   contrary to the common understanding in the art.
   Figure 6 illustrates that the type of oil used may also affect the recovery rate of the
   active agent.
    Figure 7 illustrates the distribution of cloxacillin in different tissues two hours after
15 treatment. In this case tissue is defined as remaining udder directly after milking,
   which includes extracellular liquid, blood vessels, and potentially some remaining
    milk which is not milked out.
    Figures 8 and 9 illustrates how different active agents can also have an affect on
    the release profile of the active agent itself, all else being substantially equal. In
20  Figure 8, when cloxacillin in the example composition 1 is replaced with cephapirin
    (as shown in example composition 2), the release profile is substantially slowed. In
    Figure 9, differences were also seen between cloxacillin and tylosin. This was
    indeed a surprising result and suggests that the active's release may be influenced
    by an interaction with a possible structural network formed with some or all of the
25  excipients in the composition's base.
                                                 30

   Figures 10 - 14 illustrate how the WHP of the composition may be affected by the
   characteristics of the composition.
   Figure 10 illustrates how an increase in the amount of colloidal silica from 1.75% to
   3.00% w/w can alter the WHP significantly.
 5 Figure 11 illustrates that the number of treatments does not affect WHP. The
   WHP is approximately equal regardless of whether the animal is treated with a 6 X
   24 hour or 3 X 24 hour regime.
   Figure 12 illustrates the calculated WHP of example 1 composition according to
   ACVM (Agricultural Compounds & Veterinary Medicines) guidelines.
10 Figure 13 illustrates the effectiveness of example 1 composition versus NitroCloxTM
   LA. Of particular interest is that after each treatment, the amount of active agent is
                                                                               TM
   higher when administered with the example 1 composition than NitroClox         LA,
   suggesting a higher bioavailability of example 1, 24h after treatment. Similar to
   NitroCloxTM LA, the example 1 composition does not decrease below the MIC90
15 (solid line) 24h after treatment, yet is more rapidly removed from the milk after the
   final treatment at 0 hrs.
   Figure 14 reflects the results shown in Figure 13. The example 1 composition is
   calculated to have a WHP of only 72 hours compared to 108 hours for NitroCloxTM
   LA.
20  Figure 15 compares the example 1 composition to Orbenin TM LA, albeit with a
   different treatment regime (6 X 24 hours vs. 3 X 48 hours, respectively). It can be
   seen that although the treatment regime using example 1 composition provides a
    much longer and consistent level of active agent in the milk than the treatment
    regime using OrbeninTM LA, the active agent is released from the milk much
25  quicker after the final treatment. As can be seen, the final treatment of OrbeninTM
                                               31

   LA is at 96 hours, whereas the final treatment with example 1 composition is at 120
   hours; providing a longer treatment period. Figure 16 illustrates that the calculated
   WHP is 12 hours and 24 hours shorter in the example 1 composition's 6 x 24 hour
   treatment regime compared to Orbenin's 3 x 48 hour and 5 x 24 hour treatment
 5 regimes, respectively.

     *5% overages added
   The animals used in the study were dairy cows diagnosed with clinical mastitis. On
   day 0, milk samples were obtained for bacteriological analysis and the animals
   were treated with intramammary infusions of Example 18 three times, with each
 5 treatment 24 hours apart. The dose for each treatment was 200 mg of cloxacillin as
   the sodium salt.
   On days 28 and 35, further milk samples were obtained for bacteriological analysis
   to determine the cure rate. A successful bacteriological cure required the animal to
   be clinically cured of mastitis, and for the pathogen identified in the day 0 sample to
10  be absent in the day 28 and day 35 samples.
    Interim results available as of 1 November 2012, provided a bacteriological cure
    proportion of 69.6% when treated with Example 18, from -100 cows enrolled with
    clinical mastitis, and with gram positive bacteria identified at the time of enrolment.
    A comparable study is that reported by MD Wraight, New Zealand Veterinary
15  Journal 51(1), 26-32, 2003 " A comparative efficacy trial between cefuroxime and
    cloxacillin as intramammary treatments for clinical mastitis in lactating cows on
    commercial dairy farms". In this study, 200 mg of cloxacillin in a long-acting
                                               33

   formulation was administered as an intramammary every 48 hours for three
   treatments, which resulted in a bacteriological cure proportion of 64.3%.
   The interim study results on Example 18 demonstrate high efficacy of compositions
   of the invention, even when compared to more intensive long-acting treatments
 5 using the same active. This indicates that obtaining an advantageous, shorter
   withhold period by using compositions of the invention, does not reduce or
   compromise the efficacy of the treatment.
   PART 4: Formulation Stability
   A stability study was conducted on three batches of Example 18. These batches
10 were packed into 5mL polyethylene syringes and stored at designated storage
   temperatures and humidity conditions of 25*C/60%RH, 30*C/65%RH and
    40*C/75%RH. The physical and chemical characteristics of the batches were
    recorded at regular intervals as recommended by ACVM. Based on the stability
    data, at a storage temperature of 25*C a shelf life of at least 18 months is
15  expected.
    Aspects of the present invention have been described by way of example only and
    it should be appreciated that modifications and additions may be made thereto
    without departing from the scope thereof as defined in the appended claims.
