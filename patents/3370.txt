                                       ABSTRACT
A microfluidic valve comprises a first reservoir, a second reservoir, an inertial pump
and a channel connecting the first reservoir to the second reservoir. The second
reservoir is to receive fluid from the first reservoir through the channel under a
pressure gradient. The inertial pump is within the channel proximate the second
reservoir and distant the first reservoir.

                                           BACKGROUND
       [0001]   Valves are used to minimize or eliminate flow of fluid in a specified
       direction. Valves in microfluidic systems often require specific materials that may be
       expensive, difficult to manufacture or that have limited material compatibility.
      Valves in microfluidic systems often include moving parts, reducing reliability.

                DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
       [0012]    Figure 1 schematically illustrates an example microfluidic valve 20. As will
      be described hereafter, a microfluidic valve utilizes an inertial pump to control the
                                                    -1-

WO 2015/116068                                                               PCT/US2014/013657
       flow of fluid under a pressure gradient between reservoirs. In many implementations,
      microfluidic valve 20 reduces or omits moving parts, has a lower cost and may
      provide enhanced reliability.
       [0013]    Microfluidic valve 20 comprises reservoir 22, reservoir 24, channel 32 and
      inertial pump 34. Channel 32 fluidly connects reservoirs 22 and 24. In the example
      illustrated, a pressure gradient biases fluid within reservoir 22 towards reservoir 24
      through channel 32. In one implementation, the pressure gradient is provided by an
      additional pump (not shown) that, when actuated, applies force to move the fluid from
      reservoir 22 towards reservoir 24. In another implementation, the pressure gradient
      may be provided by gravity.
       [0014]    Inertial pump 34 comprises a pumping device located along channel 32
      proximate to reservoir 24 and distant to reservoir 22. In other words, inertial pump 34
      is spaced from reservoir 24 by a distance less than one half of the length of the total
       fluid path between reservoirs 22 and 24. Inertial pump 34 utilizes inertia and
      momentum within a channel that is relatively narrow compared to the two reservoirs
      it connects to produce fluid flow. For purposes of this disclosure, the term "inertial
      pump" refers to a pumping device that initially drives fluid in both directions within a
      channel that is relatively narrow to the reservoirs it connects, but wherein the
      pumping device is asymmetrically positioned between the reservoirs such that the end
      result is fluid being driven in a direction towards the most distant of the two
      reservoirs.
       [0015]    In system 20, inertial pump 34 is selectively actuated to produce fluid flow
      in a direction to oppose the fluid flow resulting from the pressure gradient so as to
      control the flow of fluid from reservoir 22 to reservoir 24. In one implementation,
      inertial pump 34 may be actuated to an extent so as to occlude the flow of fluid from
      reservoir 22 to reservoir 24. In another implementation, inertial pump 34 may be
       selectively actuated to control and reduce the rate at which fluid flows under the
      pressure gradient from reservoir 22 to reservoir 24.
       [0016]    In one implementation, inertial pump 34 comprises a bubble jet pump. A
      bubble jet pump is a pump that produces an initially expanding bubble to move or
       drive adjacent fluid away from the bubble. One example of a bubble jet pump
                                                   -2-

WO 2015/116068                                                                 PCT/US2014/013657
      comprises a micro-heater, such as a thermal inkjet (TIJ) pump. A TIJ pump utilizes
       one or more electrical resistors through which electric current is passed. The heat
      produced by the one or more resistors as electric current passes through the one or
      more resistors vaporizes fluid that is proximate to the resistors to create a bubble. As
      this bubble is initially created and expands, the bubble initially drives adjacent fluid
      away from the bubble.
       [0017]    Figures 2(a)-2(f) illustrate operation of an example implementation of
       system 20 wherein inertial pump 34 comprises a bubble jet pump. Figures 2(a)-2(f)
      illustrate an expansion-collapse cycle of a single actuation of the bubble jet pump,
       serving as inertial pump 34. The single expansion-collapse cycle results in force
      being applied to fluid in a direction away from the reservoir 24 that is closest to
      inertial pump 34 so as to oppose and control fluid flow under the pressure gradient
       from reservoir 22.
       [0018]    Figure 2(a) illustrates system 20 in a starting state in which the fluid within
      channel 32 is at rest. Figure 2(b) illustrates system 20 upon a single actuation of the
      bubble jet pump serving as inertial pump 34. As shown by Figure 2(b), the bubble jet
      pump generates a high-pressure vapor bubble 36. The bubble provides a positive
      pressure difference that pushes fluid away from bubble 36 in both directions. As
       shown by Figure 2(c) the vapor pressure of bubble 36 quickly drops below
      atmospheric and the fluid decelerates under a negative pressure difference while
      continuing to move as a result of inertia. As shown by Figure 2(d) the fluid in the
       short arm 38 of channel 32 versus direction or turns around upon reaching the larger
      interface of reservoir 24. At the same time, the fluid in the larger arm 40 of channel
       32 continues to move towards reservoir 22. As shown by Figure 2(e), the fluid in the
      long arm 40 moving towards reservoir 22 reaches reservoir 22 and turns around or
      reverses direction such that the two fluidic columns collide at a collision point shifted
       from the starting point of the initial expansion, inertial pump 34, towards the reservoir
      22 most distant from inertial pump 34. As shown by Figure 2(f), because the fluid
       flowing from the shorter arm 38 has a greater amount of momentum at the point of
      collision, the total post collapse momentum is nonzero with the fluid ultimately being
       driven in a direction towards reservoir 22 to oppose the fluid being driven under the
                                                    -3-

WO 2015/116068                                                                PCT/US2014/013657
      pressure gradient and to control (occlude or reduce) the flow from reservoir 22 to
      reservoir 24.
       [0019]    The rate at which fluid is driven by inertial pump 34 is dependent upon the
      power and speed or "kick" of the inertial pump 34, the distance at which inertial pump
       34 is spaced from the most proximate reservoir, the cross-sectional area or width of
      the reservoir relative to the cross-sectional area or width of channel 32 and the
      viscosity of the fluid to be pumped. The movement of fluid by inertial pump as a
      result of inertia is greater than the resistance against such movement due to friction.
      In one implementation, inertial pump 34 has an initial velocity of at least 1 m/s to 10
      m/s and nominally as high as 20 m/s. In one implementation, inertial pump 32
      comprises thermal inkjet resistor which produces a vapor bubble that propels adjacent
       fluid at an initial velocity of at least 1 m/s to 10 m/s. In one implementation, the
      reservoir proximate to the inertial pump 34, reservoir 24, has a cross-sectional area or
      width of at least 5 times, and nominally at least 10 times, the cross-sectional area or
      width of channel 32. In one implementation, channel 32 has a width of 200 Pm while
      reservoir 24 has a width (measured perpendicular to the axial direction of channel 32
      at the interface of reservoir 24) of 1 mm. In yet other implementations, the difference
      in widths of channel 32 and reservoir 24 may have other values.
       [0020]    Although Figure 2 illustrates an implementation of system 20 wherein
      inertial pump 34 comprises a bubble jet pump, in other implementations, inertial
      pump 34 may comprise other pumping mechanisms or devices that initially drive fluid
      in both directions within a channel that is relatively narrow to the reservoirs it
      connects, but wherein the pumping device is asymmetrically positioned between the
      reservoirs such that the end result is fluid being driven in a direction towards the most
       distant of the two reservoirs. For example, in other implementations, inertial pump 34
      may comprise a flexible or deflectable membrane along a side of channel 32
      proximate to reservoir 24 and distant reservoir 22, wherein the membrane is
       deflectable by electrical, magnetic, mechanical or other forces to initially drive fluid
      in both directions within the relatively narrow channel. In one implementation,
      inertial pump 34 may comprise a piezo element (PZT) deflectable membrane.

       [0021]    Figure 3 is a flow diagram illustrating an example method 100 for providing
      a microfluidic valve to control the flow of fluid under pressure gradient from a first
      reservoir to a second reservoir. As indicated by step 102, a pressure gradient is
      applied to fluid to bias fluid flow from the first reservoir to the second reservoir
      through a channel. In one implementation, the bias of the pressure gradient may be
      achieved utilizing a pump or may be achieved utilizing gravity or other sources of
       force. As indicated by step 104, an inertial pump is selectively actuated proximate the
       second reservoir to selectively apply a fluid flow that counters the pressure gradient
       so as to control the rate at which fluid flows to the second reservoir under the pressure
      gradient. In one implementation, the fluid flow produced by the inertial pump is
       sufficiently large so as to completely counter the pressure gradient and occlude fluid
       flow to the second reservoir. In another implementation, the fluid flow produced by
      the inertial pump is less than the fluid flow under the pressure gradient access to
      controllably reduce the rate at which fluid flows to the second reservoir.
       [0022]    Figure 4 schematically illustrates microfluidic valve 120, an example
      implementation of microfluidic valve 20. Microfluidic valve 120 is similar to
      microfluidic valve 20 except that microfluidic valve 120 additionally comprises
      inertial pump 134 and actuator 138. Those remaining components of microfluidic
      valve 120 which correspond to components of microfluidic valve 20 are numbered
       similarly.
       [0023]    Inertial pump 134 is similar to inertial pump 34 in that inertial pump 134 is
      located along the channel 32 proximate reservoir 24 and distant reservoir 22. Inertial
      pump 134 is independently actuatable with respect to actuator 34. Actuator 138
      comprises a device to selectively actuate either of inertial pumps 34, 134, neither of
      inertial pumps 34, 134 or both of inertial pumps 34, 134 to control or valve fluid flow
      under the pressure gradient from reservoir 22 to reservoir 24. In one implementation,
      actuator 138 comprises an integrated circuit. In another implementation, actuator 138
      comprises a processing unit operating under the direction or control of computer
      readable instructions contained in a non-transitory computer-readable medium. By
       selectively and independently actuating inertial pumps 34, 134, actuator 138 controls

      the force of fluid flow opposing the fluid flowing through channel 32 from reservoir
      22 under the pressure gradient.
       [0024]     For purposes of this application, the term "processing unit" shall mean a
      presently developed or future developed processing unit that executes sequences of
      instructions contained in a non-transitory memory. Execution of the sequences of
      instructions causes the processing unit to perform steps such as generating control
       signals. The instructions may be loaded in a random access memory (RAM) for
       execution by the processing unit from a read only memory (ROM), a mass storage
       device, or some other persistent storage. In other embodiments, hard wired circuitry
      may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the
       functions described. For example, controller actuator 138 may be embodied as part of
       one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Unless otherwise
       specifically noted, the controller or actuator is not limited to any specific combination
       of hardware circuitry and software, nor to any particular source for the instructions
       executed by the processing unit.
       [0025]     In one implementation, inertial pumps 34 and 134 are located at different
      positions along channel 32 such that one of pumps 34, 134 is closer to reservoir 24
      than the other of pumps 34, 134. As a result, given the same pumping force, the
      inertial pump closest to reservoir 24 produces greater fluid flow opposing the pressure
      gradient compared to the inertial pump that is farther away from reservoir 24. By
       selectively actuating either the pump closest to reservoir 24 or the inertial pump
       farther away from inertial pump 24, actuator 138 controls the fluid flow opposing the
      pressure gradient to control the valve mechanism provided by inertial pumps 34, 134.
       [0026]     In another implementation, inertial pumps 34 and 134 are equidistantly
       spaced from reservoir 24 but have different pumping forces. For example, inertial
      pump 34 may initially drive fluid in both directions within channel 32 at a first force
       or at a first rate while inertial pump 134 may initially drive fluid in both directions
      within channel 32 at a second force or a second rate greater than the first force or first
      rate. By selectively actuating either of pumps 34, 134, actuator 138 controls the fluid
       flow opposing the pressure gradient to control the valve mechanism provided by
      inertial pumps 34, 134.

       [0027]    In one implementation, pumps 34, 134 may be both differently located along
      channel 32 relative to reservoir 24 (and reservoir 22) and may both have different
      pumping forces for enhanced control of fluid flow. Although system 120 is illustrated
      as comprising two independently actuatable inertial pumps 34, 134, in other
      implementations, system 120 may include greater than two independently actuatable
       or controllable inertial pumps to provide a greater degree of control of the degree to
      which fluid flows under the pressure gradient from reservoir 22 to reservoir 24. In
       one implementation, one or both of inertial pumps 34, 134 comprise a bubble jet
      pump. In other implementations, one or both of inertial pumps 34, 134 comprise
       other types of inertial pumps.
       [0028]    Figure 5 schematically illustrates microfluidic valve 220, an example
      implementation of microfluidic valve 20. Microfluidic valve 220 is similar to
      microfluidic valve 120 except that microfluidic valve 220 is specifically illustrated as
      comprising inertial pumps 234A, 234B, 234C and 234D (collectively referred to as
      inertial pumps 234). In the example illustrated, inertial pumps 234 are provided as an
      array of bubble jet pumps or TIJ thermal resistors within channel 32. Each of inertial
      pumps 234 is closer to reservoir 24 than reservoir 22. Each of inertial pumps 234 is
       equally spaced from reservoir 24.
       [0029]    Each of inertial pumps 234 is selectively actuatable by actuator 138. As a
      result, actuator 138 serves as a valve by controlling fluid flow through channel 32 by
       selectively actuating one or more of pumps 234 concurrently to vary a number of the
      inertial pumps 234 (a number of the TIJ resistors) that are concurrently fired to vary a
      pumping force. For example, to reduce the flow of fluid under the pressure gradient
      to reservoir 24, actuator 138 may fire inertial inertial pump 234A. To reduce fluid
       flow under the pressure gradient to reservoir 24 by an even greater extent, actuator
       138 may alternatively fire inertial pumps 234A and 234B, concurrently. To reduce
       fluid flow under the pressure gradient to reservoir 24 by a yet even greater extent,
      actuator 238 may alternatively concurrently actuate an even greater number of inertial
      pumps such as by concurrently actuating inertial pumps 234A, 234B and 234D. The
      array of inertial pumps 234 provide actuator 138 with multiple combinations for

       [0030]     Figure 6 illustrates microfluidic valve 320, another example implementation
       of microfluidic valve 20. Microfluidic valve 320 is similar to microfluidic valve 120
       except that microfluidic valve 320 is specifically illustrated as comprising inertial
      pumps 334A, 334B, 334C and 334C (collectively referred to as inertial pumps 334).
      In the example illustrated, inertial pumps 334 are provided as an array of bubble jet
      pumps or TIJ thermal resistors along channel 32. Each of inertial pumps 334 is closer
      to reservoir 24 than reservoir 22. However, each of inertial pumps 334 is differently
       spaced from reservoir 24. Each of inertial pumps 334 is selectively actuatable by
      actuator 138. As a result, actuator 138 controls fluid flow through channel 32 by
       selectively actuating one of pumps 334. To reduce the flow fluid under the pressure
      gradient to reservoir 24, actuator 138 may fire the TIJ resistive elements of inertial
      pump 334A. To reduce the flow of fluid under the pressure gradient to reservoir 24
      by a greater extent, actuator 138 may alternatively fire inertial pump 334B which is
      closer to reservoir 24. To reduce flow fluid under the pressure gradient to reservoir
      24 by an even greater extent, actuator 138 may alternatively fire inertial pump 334C
       or inertial pump 334D which are even closer to reservoir 24. As a result, actuator 138
      controls and adjusts the degree to which fluid flows under the pressure gradient from
      reservoir 22 to reservoir 24 by selectively actuating inertial pumps differently spaced
       from reservoir 24.
       [0031]     In the example illustrated, inertial pumps 334 are additionally configured to
      be concurrently actuated or fired. As a result, in addition to selectively controlling
      which of inertial pumps 334 are fired to control the valving based upon the spacing of
      the selectively fired pump from reservoir 24, actuator 138 may control fluid flow
      within channel 32 by selectively concurrently actuating two or more of pumps 334 to
      also vary the pumping force of the array of inertial pumps 334. For example, to
      reduce fluid flow under the pressure gradient reservoir 24, actuator 138 may fire
      inertial pump 334D. To reduce fluid flow under the pressure gradient to reservoir 24
      by an even greater extent, actuator 138 may alternatively fire pumps 334D and 334A,
      concurrently. To reduce fluid flow under the pressure gradient to reservoir 24 by an

       even greater extent, actuator 138 may alternatively fire pumps 334D and 334B,
      concurrently, wherein the enhanced reduction of fluid flow to reservoir 24 is a result
       of inertial pump 334B being closer to reservoir 22 as compared to inertial pump
       334A. To reduce fluid flow under the pressure gradient to reservoir 24 by a yet even
      greater extent, actuator 238 may alternatively concurrently actuate an even greater
      number of inertial pumps such as by concurrently actuating inertial pumps 334D,
       334A and 334B. The array of inertial pumps 334 provide actuator 138 with multiple
      combinations for incrementally adjusting the degree to which fluid flow under the
      pressure gradient from reservoir 22 to reservoir 24 is restricted or reduced.
       [0032]     Figure 7 schematically illustrates microfluidic valve 420, another
      implementation of microfluidic valve 20. Microfluidic valve 420 comprises a valve
       system for regulating or controlling fluid flow from one or more fluid sources under
      pressure gradient to two or more different recipient reservoirs. Microfluidic valve
      420 comprises source reservoir 422, recipient reservoirs 424A, 424B (collectively
      referred to as recipient reservoirs 424), channel 432, inertial pumps 434A, 434B
       (collectively referred to as inertial pumps 434) and actuator 438. Source reservoir 422
      is similar to source reservoir 422 of system 20 in that source reservoir 422 of system
      420 provides a supply or source of fluid under a pressure gradient so as to flow, in the
      absence of resistance, towards one or both of recipient reservoirs 424. In one
      implementation, the pressure gradient under which fluid from reservoir 42 flows may
      be provided by a pump associated with reservoir 422.
       [0033]    Recipient reservoirs 424 are similar to recipient reservoir 24. Recipient
      reservoirs 424 selectively receive fluid from source reservoir 422 through channel 432
      under the control of the inertial pumps 434 and actuator 438.
       [0034]     Channel 432 is similar to channel 32 in that channel will 432 fluidly
      connects reservoirs 422 and 424. In the example illustrated, a pressure gradient biases
       fluid within reservoir 422 towards reservoir 424 through channel 432. Channel 432
      comprises branches 440, 442A and 442B (collectively referred to as branches 442).
      Branch 440 is fluidly connected to reservoir 422, directly or indirectly, and directs the
       fluid under the pressure gradient towards a juncture or intersection 444 with branches
      442. Branch 442A extends from intersection 444 to recipient reservoir 424A. Branch

      442B extends from intersection 444 to recipient reservoir 424B. Although branches
      442 are illustrated as extending from intersection 444 at the depicted equidistant
      angles with respect to branch 440, in other implementations, branches 442 may extend
       from intersection 444 at other angles relative to one another which may or may not be
       equal.
       [0035]     Inertial pumps 434 are similar to inertial pump 34. Inertial pump 434A is
      located along branch 442A proximate to reservoir 424A and distant reservoir 422 and
       distant reservoir 424B. Inertial pump 434B is located along branch 442B proximate
      to reservoir 424B and distant reservoir 424A. In other words, inertial pumps 434A
      and 434B are closer to their associated recipient reservoirs 424A and 424B,
      respectively, than they are to reservoir 422 or the other recipient reservoirs. In one
      implementation, one or both of inertial pumps 434 comprise bubble jet pumps. In yet
       other implementations, one or both of inertial pumps 434 may comprise other types of
      inertial pumps having deflectable membranes such as a PZT pump.
       [0036]    Actuator 438 is similar to actuator 138 described above in that actuator 438
      comprises a device to selectively actuate either of inertial pumps 434A, 434B, neither
       of inertial pumps 434A, 434 B or both of inertial pumps 434A, 434 to control the flow
       of fluid under the pressure gradient from reservoir 422 to one or both of reservoirs
      424. In one implementation, actuator 438 comprises an integrated circuit. In another
      implementation, actuator 438 comprises a processing unit operating under the
       direction or control of computer-readable instructions contained in a non-transitory
      computer-readable medium. By selectively and independently actuating inertial
      pumps 434, actuator 438 controls the force of fluid flow opposing the fluid flowing
      through channel 432 from reservoir 422 under the pressure gradient.
       [0037]     In one implementation, actuator 438 may selectively actuate inertial pumps
      434 to direct the fluid coming from reservoir 422 to a selected one of reservoirs 424.
      For example, in one implementation in which fluid flowing through branch 440 in the
      absence of actuation of pumps 534B and 534C equally splits to branches 442, actuator
      438 may actuate inertial pump 434A to produce a rate of fluid flow along branch
      442A towards intersection 444 that is 1/2 of the rate of fluid flow from source
      reservoir 422 under the pressure gradient. In such an implementation, the fluid from
                                                   -10-

WO 2015/116068                                                               PCT/US2014/013657
       source reservoir 422 flows to recipient reservoir 424B. In contrast, in another
      implementation in which fluid flowing through branch 440, in the absence of
      actuation of pumps 434, equally splits to branches 442, actuator 438 may actuate
      inertial pump 434B to produce at a rate of fluid flow along branch 442B towards
      intersection 444 that is 1/2 of the rate of fluid flow from source reservoir 422 under
      the pressure gradient. In such an implementation, the fluid from source reservoir 422
       flows to recipient reservoir 424A. In some implementations, in the absence of the
       operation of either pumps 434, the fluid flowing through branch 440 may not equally
       split between channels 442, such as if channels 442 are of different sizes and/or the
      angles at intersection 444 are not equal. In such circumstances, inertial pumps 434,
      when actuated, may produce a rate of fluid flow towards intersection 444 that is
      greater than or less than one half of the rate of fluid flow from source reservoir 422
       depending upon such unequal flow characteristics from branch 440. In yet another
      implementation, actuator 438 may actuate both pumps 434 to occlude or block fluid
       flow to either of reservoirs 424A, 424B.
       [0038]    In one implementation, system 420 may comprise additional inertial pumps
      along one or both of branches 442 as described above with respect to system 220 or
       system 320. In such an implementation, by selectively actuating different
      combinations of multiple inertial pumps, actuator 438 selectively and incrementally
      controls the percentage of fluid flow from reservoir 422 that flows to each of
      reservoirs 424. For example, in implementations in which branches 442 each include
      an array of inertial pumps such as the array of the inertial pumps 234A-234D shown
      and described above with respect to system 220, actuator 438 may selectively actuate
       different numbers of the inertial pumps to vary pumping force to incrementally adjust
      the percentage a portion of fluid flow flowing from reservoir 422 under the pressure
      gradient that flows to each of reservoirs 424. In implementations in which branches
      442 each include an array of inertial pumps such as the array of the inertial pumps
       334A-334D shown and described above with respect to system 320, actuator 438 may
       selectively actuate different inertial pumps 334 at different spacing's from their
      associated recipient reservoirs 424 as well as different numbers and/or combinations
       of such inertial pumps 334 to vary the rate of fluid flow from such inertial pumps to
                                                   -11-

      incrementally adjust the percentage or portion of fluid flowing from reservoir 422
      under the pressure gradient to reservoir 424A and to reservoir 424B.
       [0039]    As shown by Figure 7, in one implementation, microfluidic valve 420 may
      additionally comprise one or more complementary flow meters or sensors 449 that
      provide feedback to actuator 438 regarding the performance of microfluidic valve
      420. In one implementation, following instructions provided in the non-transitory
      computer-readable medium, actuator 438 analyzes such feedback and adjusts
       operational parameters of inertial pumps 434 to better calibrate inertial pumps 434 to
      achieve desired control of fluid flow. For example, in one implementation, based on
       feedback from sensors 449, actuator 438 may adjust eight timing at which one inertial
      pump 434 is actuated or fired following pumping of fluid from reservoir 422 under
      the pressure gradient. In yet other implementations, flow meters or sensors 449 may
      be omitted.
       [0040]    Figures 8-13 illustrate microfluidic valve 520, an example implementation of
      microfluidic valve 20, in different operational states. Microfluidic valve 520 is
       similar to microfluidic valve 420 except that microfluidic valve 520 comprises three
      reservoirs 522A, 522B and 522C (collectively referred to as reservoirs 522) connected
      by channel 532, wherein a plurality of inertial pumps 534 is associated with each of
      reservoirs 522 serving as a source reservoir or as a recipient reservoir depending upon
      the operational state of microfluidic valve 520. The plurality of inertial pumps 53 are
       selectively actuatable by an actuator 438 (shown and described above with respect to
       system 420) to selectively control the flow of fluid from one of reservoirs 522 to a
       selected other of reservoirs 522.
       [0041]    Channel 532 is similar to channel 432. Channel 532 connects reservoirs 522
      and comprises branches 542A, 542B and 542C (collectively referred to as branches
       542) which are connected to one another at an intersection 544. Although illustrated
      as being at parallel or perpendicular to one another, branches 540 extend from one
      another at other angles.
       [0042]    In the example illustrated, system 520 comprises two selectively actuatable
      inertial pumps 534 proximate to an associated or assigned reservoir 522 and distant
      the remaining reservoirs 522. In the example illustrated, system 520 comprises

      inertial pumps 534A1, 534A2 proximate reservoir 522A, comprises inertial pumps
       534B1, 534B2 proximate reservoir 522B and comprises inertial pumps 534C1, 534C2
      proximate reservoir 522C. Each of inertial pumps 534 is independently actuatable by
      actuator 438 such that one of each pair of inertial pumps 534 may be actuated, such
      that both inertial pumps of a pair may be actuated or such that neither inertial pumps
       of a pair are actuated. In the example illustrated, each of inertial pumps 534, when
       fired, produces approximately the same pumping force to produce fluid flow at a rate
       equal to the rate of the other inertial pumps 534 when fired. In one implementation,
       each of inertial pumps 534 comprises a bubble jet pump comprising a micro-heater
       such as a TIJ thermal resistive element. In other implementations, inertial pumps 534
      may comprise other types of inertial pumps such as inertial pumps having deflectable
      membranes such as PZT pumps.
       [0043]    Figure 8 illustrates microfluidic valve 520 in a first operational state in
      which fluid is pumps from reservoir 522A and is directed to reservoir 522B. In the
       example illustrated, actuator 438 (shown in Figure 7) actuates or fires both of inertial
      pumps 534A1 and 534A2 to pump fluid from reservoir 522A. After a predefined time
      period following the actuation or firing of pumps 534A1 and 534A2, depending upon
      the length dimensions of channel 532, the viscosity of the fluid and the characteristics
       of pumps 534, actuator 438 actuates or fires inertial pump 534C1 while pumps 534C2
      and 534B1, 534B2 remain inactive or off. In one implementation, in which fluid
       flowing through branch 542A, in the absence of actuation of pumps 534B and 534C,
       equally splits to branches 542B and 542C, the firing of inertial pump 534C1 produces
       1/2 the fluid flow of the firing of inertial pumps 534A1 and 534A2, combined. As a
      result, fluid flow through branch 542C to reservoir 522C is substantially occluded or
       shut off (as represented by "X") such that the fluid from reservoir 522A flows through
      branch 542B into reservoir 522B.

      pumps 534A1 and 534A2 to pump fluid from reservoir 522A. After a predefined time

       [0045]    Figure 10 illustrates microfluidic valve 520 in a third operational state in
      which fluid is pumps from reservoir 522C and is directed to reservoir 522A. In the
       example illustrated, actuator 438 (shown in Figure 7) actuates or fires both of inertial
      pumps 534C1 and 534C2 to pump fluid from reservoir 522C. After a predefined time
      period following the actuation or firing of pumps 534C1 and 534C2, depending upon
      the length dimensions of channel 532, the viscosity of the fluid and the characteristics
       of pumps 534, actuator 438 actuates or fires inertial pump 534B1 while pumps 534B2
      and 534A1, 534A2 remain inactive or off. In one implementation, in which fluid
       flowing through branch 542B, in the absence of actuation of pumps 534A and 534B,
       equally splits to branches 542A and 542B, the firing of inertial pump 534B1 produces
       1/2 the fluid flow of the firing of inertial pumps 534C1 and 534C2, combined. As a
      result, fluid flow through branch 542B to reservoir 522B is substantially occluded or

      branch 542A into reservoir 522A.
       [0046]    Figure 11 illustrates microfluidic valve 520 in a fourth operational state in
      which fluid is pumped from reservoir 522B and is directed to reservoir 522A. In the
       example illustrated, actuator 438 (shown in Figure 7) actuates or fires both of inertial
      pumps 534B1 and 534B2 to pump fluid from reservoir 522B. After a predefined time
      period following the actuation or firing of pumps 534B1 and 534B2 and depending
      upon the length dimensions of channel 532, the viscosity of the fluid and the

       [0049]    Although microfluidic valve 520 is illustrated as having a pair of inertial
      pumps 534 associate with each reservoir 522, in other implementations, microfluidic
      valve 520 may include a greater number of such inertial pumps associated with each
      reservoir 522. Although microfluidic valve 520 is illustrated as having inertial pumps
       534 which are stacked in a direction orthogonal to branches 542, wherein the rate at
      which fluid is pumped is adjusted by adjusting the number of pumps 534 of each pair
      that are fired, in other implementations, pumps 534 may be stacked in a direction
      parallel to the branch 542 in which the pumps are located (similar to pumps 334 of
       system 320) such that the rate at which fluid is pumped by such pumps may
      additionally be adjusted by selectively firing inertial pumps 534 that are spaced from
       different distances from their associated reservoirs 522.
       [0050]    In each of the examples shown in Figures 8-13, in the absence of any
      resistant flow from the inertial pumps in the branches leading to the recipient
      reservoirs , the relative angles of the branches with respect to one another and the
      relatively equal sizes of such branches results in the fluid flowing from the source
      reservoir equally splitting between the two recipient reservoirs at intersection 544. To
       occlude fluid flow to one of the recipient reservoirs, the inertial pumps within the
      branch in which fluid flow is occluded produce a fluid flow rate that is one half the
      rate of fluid flow from the reservoir serving as the source of fluid. In some
      implementations, in the absence of any resistant flow from the inertial pumps in the
      branches leading to the recipient reservoirs, the fluid flowing from the source
      reservoir may not equally split at intersection 544, such as when the branches leading
      to the recipient reservoirs of different sizes and/or the angles at intersection 544 are
      not equal. In such circumstances, the inertial pumps in the branch being occluded
      may produce rate of fluid flow towards intersection 544 that is greater than or less
      than one half of the rate of fluid flow from source reservoir 522 to achieve such fluid
       flow occlusion. In some implementations, the resistant flow of the inertial pumps in

      the branches may alternatively be sized to reduce fluid flow to an associated reservoir
      rather than to occlude or completely block such fluid flow.
       [0051]    Figures 14 and 15 illustrate microfluidic valve 620, an example
      implementation of microfluidic valve 20, in different operational states. Microfluidic
      valve 620 is similar to microfluidic valve 620 except that valve microfluidic valve
       620 comprises four reservoirs 622A, 622B, 622C and 622C (collectively referred to as
      reservoirs 622) connected by channel 632, wherein a plurality of inertial pumps 634 is
      associated with each of reservoirs 622 serving as a source reservoir or as a recipient
      reservoir depending upon the operational state of microfluidic valve 620. The
      plurality of inertial pumps 634 are selectively actuatable by an actuator 438 (shown
      and described above with respect to system 420) to selectively control the flow of
       fluid from one of reservoirs 622 to one or more other reservoirs 622.
       [0052]    Channel 632 is similar to channel 532. Channel 632 connects reservoirs 622
      and comprises branches 640A, 640B, 640C and 640D (collectively referred to as
      branches 640) which are connected to one another at an intersection 644. Although
      illustrated as being parallel or perpendicular to one another, branches 640 may extend
       from one another at other angles.
       [0053]    In the example illustrated, system 620 comprises three selectively actuatable
      inertial pumps 634 proximate to each associated or assigned reservoir 622 and distant
      the remaining reservoirs 622. In the example illustrated, system 620 comprises
      inertial pumps 634A1, 634A2 proximate reservoir 622A, comprises inertial pumps
       634B1, 634B2 proximate reservoir 622B, comprises inertial pumps 634C1, 634C2
      proximate reservoir 622C and comprises inertial pumps 634D1, 634D2 proximate
      reservoir 622D. Each of inertial pumps 634 is independently actuatable by actuator
      438 such that one or more inertial pumps of each set of inertial pumps 634 may be
      actuated, such that both actuators of a pair may be actuated or such that neither
      actuators of a pair are actuated. In the example illustrated, each of inertial pumps 634,
      when fired, produces approximately the same pumping force to produce fluid flow at
      a rate equal to the rate of the other inertial pumps 634 when fired. In one
      implementation, each of inertial pumps 634 comprises a bubble jet pump comprising
      a micro-heater such as a TIJ thermal resistive element. In other implementations,

      inertial pumps 634 may comprise other types of inertial pumps such as inertial pumps
      having deflectable membranes such as PZT pumps.
       [0054]    Figure 14 illustrates microfluidic valve 620 in a first operational state in
      which fluid is pumps from reservoir 622A and is directed to reservoir 622B. In the
       example illustrated, actuator 438 (shown in Figure 7) actuates or fires each of inertial
      pumps 634A1, 634A2 and 634A3 to pump fluid from reservoir 622A. After a

       depending upon the length dimensions of channel 632, the viscosity of the fluid and
      the characteristics of pumps 634, actuator 438 actuator fires inertial pumps 634C1 and
       634D1 while pumps 634C2, 634C3 and each of inertial pumps 634B1-634B3 remain
      inactive or off. In one implementation, in which fluid flowing through branch 642A,
      in the absence of actuation of pumps 634B, 634C and 634D, equally splits to branches
       642B, 642C and 642D, the firing of inertial pump 634C1 produces 1/3 of the fluid
       flow of the firing of inertial pumps 634Al-534A3, combined. As a result, fluid flow
      through branch 642C to reservoir 622C is substantially occluded or shut off (as
      represented by "X"). The firing of inertial pump 634D1 produces 1/3 of the fluid
       flow of the firing of inertial pumps 634Al-634A3, combined. As a result, fluid flow
      through branch 642D to reservoir 622D is substantially occluded or shut off (as

       substantially occluded or shut off (as represented by "X"). The firing of inertial pump
       634C1 produces 1/3 of the fluid flow of the firing of inertial pumps 634Al-634A3,

       substantially occluded or shut off (as represented by "X"). As a result, the fluid from
      reservoir 622A flows through branch 642D into reservoir 622D. Microfluidic valve
       620 may be operated in similar fashions to selectively direct fluid from a selected one
       of reservoirs 622 into another selected one of reservoirs 622. In a similar fashion,
      microfluidic valve 620 may be operated to selectively fire or actuate inertial pumps
       634 to direct fluid from a selected one of reservoir 622 into each of the other of
      reservoirs 622 or a selected pair of reservoirs 622. In some implementations,
      microfluidic valve 620 may be operated to direct fluid from a pair of reservoirs or
      three of such reservoirs into one or two selected reservoirs by selectively actuating
      inertial pumps 634.
       [0056]    In each of the examples shown in Figures 14 and 15, in the absence of any
      resistant flow from the inertial pumps in the branches leading to the recipient
      reservoirs , the relative angles of the branches with respect to one another and the
      relatively equal sizes of such branches results in the fluid flowing from the source
      reservoir equally splitting between the three recipient reservoirs at intersection 644.
      To occlude fluid flow to two of the recipient reservoirs, the inertial pumps within the
      branches in which fluid flow is occluded produce a fluid flow rate that is one third the
      rate of fluid flow from the reservoir serving as the source of fluid. In other
      implementations in which there are n potential recipient reservoirs to receive fluid
       from a source reservoir and in which fluid flow from the source reservoir equally
       splits amongst the different branches at the intersection in the absence of any resistant
       flows, fluid flow is directed to a particular one of the potential recipient reservoirs by
      actuating the inertial pumps in the individual branches leading to the recipient
      reservoirs so as to produce a resistant flow that is 1/n of the fluid flow rate from the
       source reservoir.

       [0057]    In some implementations, in the absence of any resistant flow from the
      inertial pumps in the branches leading to the recipient reservoirs, the fluid flowing
       from the source reservoir may not equally split at the intersection, such as at
      intersection 644. This unequal splitting a fluid flow at the intersection may result
      when the branches leading to the recipient reservoirs have different sizes and/or the
      angles at intersection 644 are not equal. In such circumstances, the inertial pumps in
      the branch being occluded may produce rate of fluid flow towards intersection 644
      that is greater than or less than 1/n of the rate of fluid flow from the source reservoir
      to achieve such fluid flow occlusion. In some implementations, the resistant flow of
      the inertial pumps in the branches may alternatively be sized to reduce fluid flow to
      an associated reservoir rather than to occlude or completely block such fluid flow.
       [0058]    Although microfluidic valve 620 is illustrated as having a set of three inertial
      pumps 634 associated with each reservoir 622, in other implementations, microfluidic
