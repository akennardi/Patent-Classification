  ABSTRACT
  The present invention relates to a method for generating for display to a user a plurality
  of program identifiers in response to a search query received from the user. The
5 plurality of program identifiers comprises a program identifier corresponding to a
  program previously paused by the user. The method comprises playing back a program
  on first user equipment and receiving a command at the first user equipment to pause
  the program. Based on receiving the command, the method further comprises pausing
  playback of the program on the first user equipment; and storing a pause point
0 corresponding to a time at which the command was received.
  The method involves receiving, at second user equipment, a search query. In response
  to receiving the search query, the method involves generating for simultaneous display
  at the second user equipment a plurality of program identifiers comprising a program
  identifier corresponding to the program.
5 The method involves receiving, at the second user equipment, a selection of the
  program identifier; and based on receiving the selection of the program identifier at the
  second user equipment, retrieving the pause point, and playing back the program on the
  second user equipment from a point corresponding to the pause point.

   Background of the Invention
        Mere reference to background art herein should not
20 be construed as an admission that such art constitutes
   common general knowledge in relation to the invention.
        The present invention relates to on-demand media
   delivery systems and more particularly, to on-demand
   media delivery systems that have user-related memory for
25 providing system enhancements.
        In some known video on-demand systems, a set-top box
   may be used to receive on-demand video from cable system
   headends.   Such set-top boxes may communicate or may
   deliver the video and/or other functionality to
30 television sets, VCRs, or other local devices.    These
   systems have been deficient in allowing users to relocate
   their video-on-demand service to different locations.
   These systems may have also been deficient in providing
   adequate relocation techniques,

                                   -2
       deficient  in allowing users to upload and access their
       personal videos, graphics, images, or photographs
                                                            and
       deficient in allowing users to share media.
                  Systems have been developed that use hard
   5   disk technology or other recording technology to store
       videos of programs locally.    Examples of hard disk
       systems are described, in Hassell et al. U.S. Patent
      Application No. 09/157,256 filed September 17, 1998,
       which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in
                                                               its
 10    entirety. Hard-disk based products have also been
       developed by TiVo, Inc. of Sunnyvale, California, and
      Replay Networks, Inc. of Mountainview, California.
      These systems have been deficient in meeting user
      needs.   For example, these systems do not allow the
 15   user to relocate to other households with continued
      access to the recorded materials.
                 Television platforms have also been developed
      that include a return path from a user's set-top box
                                                                to
      a cable system headend. For example, client-server
20    based program guides have been developed in which set
      top boxes are in client-server arrangements with the
      cable system headends. These arrangements allow for
      two-way communication between the cable system headends
      and set-top boxes.    These servers typically provide
25   program listings information (e.g., program titles and
     broadcast times) to the set-top boxes in response
                                                            to
     requests generated from the set-top boxes.      Client
     server television program guides have also been
     developed where programming and settings may be
30   recorded on a remote server.      These known systems have
     been deficient in various ways.      For example, servers
     in such systems    (servers at the cable system headends)
     have been deficient in providing sufficient     mobility
     features.

     619,   the program      guide may direct the server in remote
     server network       110 to record       the video-on-demand
     program on      the  relevant storage        space 190.     When the
     user selects record option 619,              the server may record
20   some or all of the video-on-demand program. that is
     currently available to the user.               These are merely
     illustrative examples and any suitable technique for
     handling video-on-demand recordings may be used if
     desired.
25                If the user selects rewind option 616, the
    program guide may direct the appropriate device, such
    as server 180 of FIG. 1, to skip to an earlier portion
    of the video-on-demand program.                A real-time rewind
    process may be used in which the video-on-demand
30  programming is displayed during the rewind operation.
    Commands for pausing, playing and fast-forwarding may
    be handled similarly.

                      A  relocate           feature        may be        included       in  the on
   demand media system.                       This relocate              feature may allow a
20 user      to    freeze media-on demand                       content being presented
   on one user equipment                      and switch to some other user
   equipment to resume the presentation of the media
   on-demand content                 (i.e.,         resume from the point at which
   the user had frozen the content).                                   The user equipment
25 may be equipment                such as user equipment 260 and 265 of
   FIG. 2.          If   the user wants to continue watching the on
   demand media content at a friends house                                        (e.g.,   user
   equipment          system 265 of FIG.                    2),    the user may only have
   to use the relocate                   feature to freeze the on-demand
30 media       content and relocate to the friend's                                   house to
   resume the on-demand media content.

               FIG. 7B shows illustrative relocation display
 screen 730 that may be displayed when a command from
 remote control       300 of FIG.       3 is   selected or when an
 appropriate option on an on-demand medaa display screen
 is   selected to resume on-demand media that was frozen
 earlier by the user.          Option 740 may be selected if a
 user wants to start        to view the media from the frozen
point on user equipment that is different (e.g.,
 different household,         different       subscriber    site,
 different room,       different     equipment platform,           etc.)
 than that which was used to freeze the media.
               When a user selects continue option 740, the
media may be presented on the current user equipment
starting from the frozen point.                  If desired, media may
be queued to the frozen point               for presentation        to a
user when a user who had previously                  selected a freeze
 (or relocated)      option    logs into the system.              Also, if
desired,     the media may be queued selectively upon user
request     (e.g., user selects a resume from frozen point
option).      If the user has not previously logged in or
otherwise been identified,             the user may be asked to log

                                     -    23

   by a user,     remote server network 110 c               lG.        may, for
   example,    pause the on-demand media           content       beino viewed
   by the user and store a content location reference to
   an appropriate user-specific account. After the user
10 switches to a different          location and requests that               the
   paused content be appropriately delivered,                    remote
   server network 110 may retrieve the appropriate content
   location reference and continue delivering the media
   content from the point at which the user paused the
15 content.      Before the media content may be delivered,
   the remote server network may require that the user be
   identified so that the appropriate user-specific data
   and/or a user-specific account information, may be
    located and accessed.
20               User-specific      data or account         information may
   be stored in a section of remote server network 110
    (FIG. 1) dedicated to the user.              Remote server network
    110  (FIG.   1)  may be a VOD server that is              configured to
    store such information and data.               An account on remote
25  server network 110        (FIG.    1)   may also be used to store
    that user's personal images or video.                  Remote s-erver
    network    (FIG. 1) may allow users to access their
    personal images or videos from their              own home or from
    user equipment at other locations.
30                FIG.  7C is   a flow chart of        illustrative
    relocation process        760 that shows how data             is    stored
    and accessed when a relocate feature is                  selected.
    Process    760 begins with start          step 761 that may include
    almost any interaction          with the media-delivery system

                                           -  24
      that results in the relocation feature being :resented
      to the user.           Start ster 763 may, for example, be a
      user interaction- that brincs up relocate dLipay screen
      700 of  FIG.       77.    At step   762,   a user may be cm7en an
  f   opportunity to choose or            confirm the relocate          f earure.
                     If desired, stey        762 may include      siep     771   for
      idertifyino a current user             (e.g.,   identifying a current
      user on a first user equipment)             -   User identification
      step 771 may provide the user with the ability tc log
 10   into the on-demand media system, which may include
      prompting the user for an identification                and/or
     password.         Step 771 may be performed,         for example,         in
      response to a user selecting              the relocate    feature.
                    If desired, step 771 may be part of start
15    step 761 to allow the system to identify the current
     user before the relocate feature is selected by the
     user.
                   The on-demand media system may then save the
     user's current position (step 763) when the user
20   selects the relocate feature.                Saving the current
     position may involve,           for example,      saving a pointer
     that identifies           where the media content was          'frozen'      or
    paused by the relocate feature.                  If the user was
     identified       in    step 771,   process 760 may store any data
25  relevant     to the operation of the relocate feature in
     storage space associated with the user.                  If desired,
     saving the current position may involve recording the
    media content from the point at which the relocate
    feature was chosen.            At step 764,      process 760 may enter
30  an idle mode until a user selects to resume reception.
    Step 764 may include step 772 for identifying the
    current user          (e.g.,   identifying      a current user on a
    second user equipnent)-.             Step 772 may be performed when
    a user selects           to resume media using the relocate

                                                  - 25
   feature.          At step 772,             the system may provide                a current
   user with the ability to iog intc the on-demand                                     media
   system, which may include prompting the use-                                    for   ar:
   identification and/or password.                             If    desired,      step      72
   may be      performed before                 the   current        user     seecs
   resume mecia            using       the    relocate feature.
                     At step 765,             the location of the media
   content that            was being viewed when                   the relocate         feature
   was    initially          selected may be             retrieved.            If the user
10 was    identified           in    step     27,     data      associated        with the
   operation         of    the     relocate        feature may be retrieved                   from
   storage        space      associated           with   the current           user.
                     If    a pointer          was stored,           the    system may       find
   the correct           location          of   content       in    the on-demand media
15 delivery         system using             the -hinter.and              continue playing
   the media         from that           point      (Step 765)        .    If desired, the
   media may         have been            remotely recorded               from   the point at
   which      the relocate              future -was selected.                 In such
   embodiments,            the system will simply begin playing
20 content from the point at which the content was
   recorded.            After the content .has been. successfully
   retrieved         and resumed,              finish step 766 may occur which
   may denote the end of process                          760.
                     FIG.       8 illustrates           relocation process 80 and
25  is   similar to process 760,                     but includes the possibility
   of relocating while watching live content.                                     Steps 881,
    882,    891,      886,      892,      and 888 are essentially                  the same as
   steps      761,      762,      771,      764,    772,    and 766 of FIG.            7C,
   respectively.               At live feed check step 883, the system
30 may determine if                 the current media is                  a live feed.           If
   the media          is   not a live feed,               step 885 is           performed,
   which involves storing the current position of the
   media.         If the media is                a live feed,            the media     may be
   remotely recorded at step 684.                              After step 884 occurs,

                                        -  26
      the position of        the media may be      stored at step 885.
      If  desired,     the pcsitior    of    thE media    may be stored ir:
      the  form of     a pointer.     During step 886,          "he system may
     be in    an          s-ate,

      that   the user has      relocated     tc new user       equipment.    I
      desired,    process     880 may include      steps 891       and 892 at
     Particular points in process 880 as shown and/or
     discussed above in connection with steps 771 and 22 of
     FIG. 2C for identifying a current user at a first user
 10  equipment and at a second user equipment when a user
     has relocated       to the second user        equipment.        After a
     user has relocated,         the system may,      in     step 887,
     determine      the stored media position,          retrieve      the
     stored media position,         and then continue playing the
 15  media    from the stored media position.               Once play
     commences,      finish step 888      is   reached and the user        is
     successfully relocated.
                   A remote on-demand media server may be
     configured to store and deliver user-specific media
20    (e.g., pictures, videocam recordings, etc.), or user
     uploaded data or media.          Access to such data and media
     may be controlled in a variety of ways.
                   FIG. 9 shows illustrative          data and media
     access process 900 for remote servers. At step 901,                       a
25   static request from the on- demand media system or a
    manual request from a user interfacing                  with user
    equipment may be received.              The request may be
    associated with the retrieval              of media content or user
    specific data.
30                To retrieve media content,            server      180 of
    FIG.    1 may be accessed.        At step 902,        in    response to a
    request     for user-specific       data,    the appropriate device

                if     access  to the data or media does not need
    any type of authorization,           the data or media may be
    retrieved    and the user may be provided with an
    opportunity to access the data or               the media at steps
IC  902 and 90&.        Da-a or media       that may not require access
    privileges may include,          for example,       data or media
    defined by a user as public.
                 If    authorization      is   needed,    then at step 904
    or at step 905,        a request may be sent to determine if
15  the user has permission to access                the desired data or
    media.    Steps 904 and 905 may include asking the user
    for an account identity and/or password.                    At step 906,
    users may be denied         access when the users have not been
    given access rights for the desired data or media.                        If
20   a user does have permission to access the desired data
    or media, the user may be given access to the data at
     step 907 or access to the media at step 908.

25   combined.      Also if desired, 907 and 908 may be
     combined.
                 As mentioned above, the on-demand media
     system realizes many unique             features    in   utilizing     the
     capabilities       of remote storage and remote access.                 Some
 30  of such unique features may be realized in                     connection
     with remotely       stored user profiles          or remotely stored
     user accounts.
                  An on-demand media           delivery system may have
     an account      for a user or a group of users                (e.g., a

                                        28
      household)that may be used to store user profiles for
      users associated with the account. A user profile may
       act a-s a governing data structure through which user
       specific data and on-demand media content and data may
   5  be accessed, stored, and retrieved.
                     Remote server network     110 of FIG.  1 may be
      partitioned and formatted to include a user account for
      any user or group of users in which account-specific
      data  and on-demand media      content may be stored,
 10   manipulated, and accessed.
                    FIG. 10 shows illustrative profile display
      screen 1000 that may include user identification
      information 1005 to show who is currently recognized by
      the system.      If a new user wishes to login, new login
 15   option   1031 may be selected and a login display screen
      such as display      screen  650 of FIG.   6B may be initiated.
      If the user desires an option that is not present on
     display screen 1100, more options button 1032 may be
     selected.
20                 Region 1010 includes a number of different
     user-selectable options such as a preferences option as
     shown.      These options may allow the user to-access or
     use locally      or remotely stored data or media when the
     user is logged into the system.
25                 FIG. 11 shows illustrative account
     administration display screen 1150 that may be.
     displayed when account administration option 1034 of
     FIG. 10 is selected.         Account information 1151 may be
     displayed on display screen 1150 to show which-user is
30   currently recognized and to identify the administrative
     position of that       user.   Account administration window
     1160 may be located on display screen          1150 and-may
     contain a list      of users or groups that are under the
     recognized user's account. The recognized user may

                                   29
   change the properties of the users or groups in window
   1160 through administrative controls 11T0.        A user may
   change properties of a user or a group by first
   selecting a user or group from window 1160        (e.g.,
 5 pressing a data entry key when a highlighted window is
   positioned over a user or group) and next positioning a
   cursor or highlight window on one of the options in
   controls 1170 to take desired action.        Examples of
   controls that may be included in administrative
10 controls 1170 may include, for example, add new group,
   add new user, restrict group, restrict user, limit
   group, limit user, delete group, delete user, create a
   new account for a user, and create a new account for a
   group.
15             Storing user-specific data such as the user's
   preferences     (e.g.,  preferences in general, preferences
   for on-demand media, etc.)      in a remote server such as a
   VOD server may allow for a personal auto-configure
   feature that would follow a user to move from equipment
20 to equipment.       This feature may allow preferences to be
   retrieved and executed by user equipment after the user
   has been identified      by the system  (e.g.,  identified by
   a remote server network) .      Some categories of
   preferences and user-specific information that may be
25 used in an auto-configure feature may include, for
   example, volume settings, favorite channels, reminders,
   information about user-recorded on-demand media
   content, the user's last activity, auto-record times,
   as well as any other preference or activity.          For
30 example,  after     a user is verified by a remote server
   network, the user equipment may selectively or
   automatically be configured to match or use sqme or all
   of the user's remotely stored preferences.

                                  -   30
                FIG.  12 shows illustrative      auto-configure
     display screen 1200, which may be initiated after a
     user has logged in   via a login display -screen      (e.g.,
     display screen 650 of FIG. 6B) .        Display screen 1200
  5 may allow a user to select have user equipment          auto
     configured.    The user equipment may be user equipment
     that is currently being used that user.         The user
     equipment may be auto-configured by downloading user
     related data and information and processing the data
10   and information on the user equipment        to suit the
     current user.
                Information region 1210 may be present on
    display screen 1200 and may include data from a user's
    profile or data related to a user's login.          Configure
15  options 1220 may be included on display screen 1200.
     Information stored in a user's profile may be accessed
    to perform a number of activities when one of options
    1220 are selected.     The options displayed among in
    configure options 1220 may vary depending on types of
20  the information that are stored in a particular user's
    profile.   Examples of configuration options 1220 may
    include, for example, auto-configuration options, last
    activity options, favorite show option, last show
    option, and favorite activity option.
25             Always auto-configure option 1211 may be
    selected by a user to automatically configured user
    equipment with the user's personal information whenever
    the user logs into the system.          Auto-configure
    option 1212 may be displayed when always auto configure
30  option 1211 was not previously selected by the user.
    Auto-configure option 1212 may be selected to auto
    configure the currently used user equipment.           User
    equipment settings may be deleted or reset by the user

                                       -   31
   equipment settings by after a user has logged off and
   is--n-e-ngc-r recognized to be the user equipment.
                 FIG.   13 shows    illustrative           process 1350 that
   may be involved in automatically configuring user
 5 equipment.       The process may begin at start                   step 1351,
   when,     for example,     an on-demand media delivery system
   is activated.        A user may be allowed to log into the
   system at step 1352.          At step 1353, the user's login
   information may be verified.                 At   step 1354,         if the
10 login information that          is entered is valid, the system
   may check to       see if   the   account       of the       logged in    user
   indicates     that   the always       auto-configure           feature    is
   selected.       If the account shows the always auto
   configure     feature to be selected,                the user equipment
15 that     was used for logging         into    the     system may be
   automatically       configured with that              user's     preference
   information at step 1358.
                 At step 1358,       auto-configuration preferences
   and information may be retrieved and downloaded to the
20 currently-used user equipment and the user equipment
   may be configured based on the preferences                         and
   information.
                 If   the option to always auto-configure was
   not selected,       a user may be provided with an
25 opportunity to have the currently-used user equipment
   automatically configured for the current login at step
   1355.      Step 1358 may be performed when the user selects
   the auto-configure option during the current login.                            At
   finish step 1359,         a user may be allowed to resume other
30 activity.       In this technique, some or all of a user's
   profile or preferences may be stored at a remote
   server.
                 The on-demand media delivery system may also
   contain an upload feature.                 FIG.    14A <depicts an

                                  -  32
       illustrative upload file display screen 1400 which
                                                             may
       be initiated in order to upload a file.    If desired,
       the upload feature may include a process that
       automatically scans user equipment for upload devices.
   5   Upload device buttons 1420 may be displayed on display
       screen 1400 when different file sources are available.
       For example, display screen 1400 may include
                                                       VCR upload
       button 1411, computer upload button 1412, and DVD
       player upload button 1413. A user may be allowed
                                                            to
 10    select a button from buttons 1420 to upload data from
       the device associated with that button.
                 The upload feature may also include an
       Internet address entry box 1410. A user may type
                                                            or
       select a file address in box 1410.   The on-demand media
 15   system may search the Internet for a file based
                                                          on the
      file address and may upload the file. A user
                                                        may
      select practically any file to upload when the file
                                                               is
      found and have the file stored on a remote server of
      the on-demand media system.
20               Files uploaded to the remote server (e.g.,
      VOD server) may also be downloaded to user equipment
                                                                to
      be presented to a user. Files may be transferred
                                                            from
      one user equipment to a different   user equipment system
      through a media-on-demand remote server.     Files may
25    include almost any type of data, program, or content.
     Examples of files that may be uploaded include, for
     example, pictures, movies, songs, video games,
     documents, e-mails, and Internet Web pages.      Files  such
     as pictures, movies, songs, video, or other audio
30   visuals materials may be of particular interest
                                                          because
     on-demand media servers are particularly suited
                                                          for the
     delivery and presentation   of audio-visuals   to users.
                Process 14-50 is illustrated in FIG. 14B to
     show illustrative steps that may be involved in

                                 - 33
  uploading a file to a device such as a VOD server. At
  step 1452, a user may be provided -with an opportunity
  to select an upload feature. At step 1454, the on
  demand media system may check to see if a user is
  currently logged into the system.        If a user is not
  currently logged in,     user login may be requested at
  step 1455.    At step 1456 the system may check to see
  whether the login was valid.        The upload process may
  commence at step 1457 when the current user is logged
  into the system.
              At step 1457,   the system will determine if
  file   location information has been given by the user.
  If   desired, the system may search the user equipment
  for file source devices. If file source devices are
 found,    appropriate   upload options may be presented at
 step 1459.     These options may be presented to a user in
 the form of device buttons 1410 of FIG. 14A. If no
 devices were found at step 1458, default options may be
 presented to the user at step 1460.         Default options
may include, for example, an Internet upload box or a
 list:   of possible storage devices that      the user
 equipment may include.       At step 1461,    a user may be
provided with an opportunity to select          a file    location
 for upload using the presented options.          At step 1462,
the selected file may be uploaded.          If desired, at step
1462, the system may convert file         formats for files
that are being uploaded        (e.g.,  convert  JPG files    to
MPEG files)     and/or may convert analog signals to
digital file format.
              After a file   has been uploaded in      step 1462,
a user may want to assign access rights to that file.
A user may also want to download the file           to a
different device in the on-demand media system.              FIG.
1SA is an illustration       of display screen 1500 which may

                                   - 34
       allow a user to download a recently uploaded file or to
       assign access rights to that file.
                  If a user desi-res to designate an uploaded
       file as a public file, public button 1531 may be
   5   selected.   If a user desires to designate an uploaded
       file as a private file, private button 1532 may be
       selected.   Download buttons 1520 may also be included
       in display screen 1500.    If desired, the system may
       convert file formats for files that are downloaded
 10    (e.g., convert JPG files to MPEG files) and/or may
      provide digital to analog format conversions.       Examples
      of such buttons may include for example., download to
      VCR button 1511, download to computer button 1512, and
      download to DVD player button 1513.      If desired,
 15   however, the user may be presented with an option
                                                               to
      have the file, which may be an audiovisual file,
      displayed or played back for the user.       For example,
      the system may present the user with "view on your TV"
      option 1533, which may allow the user to view the
                                                               file
20    on the user's television set.
                 Files that are designated as private may be
      files that are associated with a particular user
                                                            or
     with particular groups of users that have access rights
      to the file to the exclusion of others.       Access may be
25    limited to certain activities, which may include,
                                                              for
     example, downloading, viewing, deleting, writing, and
     manipulating a file.
                 FIG. 15B illustrates display screen 1550,        in
     which a user may grant and restrict access to
30   particular users or groups of users in the on-demand
     media system.    Display screen    1550 may include identity
     listings 1580 that contains a list of users and
                                                           groups
     in the on-demand media system.       After selecting a user
     or group from listings 1580 (e.g., by navigating on a

                                   -   35
   listing and pressing a select key) , a user may use
   grant button 1562 to grant access to a selected user--or
   group.    A user may select restrict button 1563 to
   restrict access to selected user or groups.               If the
 5 user decides to make the file           a public file, the user
   may select public button 1564.
                  The on-demand media system may include a file
   search feature to aid users in locating files.                FIG.
   16A illustrates display screen 1600 from which a user
10 may search for files on the on-demand media system.
   Display screen 1600 may contain search-type listings
   1611.    Listings 1611 may include options that allow a
   user to designate which types of files are to be
   located in a search. -Examples of file types in
15 listings 1611 may include, files to which the user has
   access rights, files associated with the current user,
   files for the presentation of audiovisuals such as
   pictures,      games,  or videos,    or files    for any other type
   of data
20                Search listings 1612 may be included in
   display -screen 1600 to give a user capabilities to
   narrow a search.        A user may use listings        1612 to enter
   searchable text that may be associated with either a
   file's title or description.             Identity search listings
25 box 1613 may also be included in             display screen 1600 to
   narrow a search even further.              Box 1613 gives a user
   the capabilities       to search for files       associated with
   specific identities.        After 'one or more files        have been
   found by the on-demand media system, the user may
30 download the file either to the remote server or to a
   device in the user equipment system.
                  FIG.  16B is an illustration       .of display screen
   1650 that      allows a user to download files         which were
   located in a file search.          Display s-creen 1650 may

                                 - 36
      contain found files listings box 1680, in which the
      found files may be listed.   Box 1680 may list found
      Liles in any manner,  such as alphabetically,   and--if
     desired may include a data or ownership hierarchy
  5  showing where the file   was found in  the system.    Files
     from box 1680 may be downloaded to a remote     server with
     the selection of a download button,    such as download
     button 1662.   For example, a user may select a file in
     box 1680 and then move a cursor to button 1662 to
 10  select that button.    Device download buttons 1670 may
     also be included in display screen 1650 based on what
     devices are included in the currently-used user
     equipment.   Download buttons may include for example,
     download to VCR button 1671, download to computer
15   button 1672, download to DVD player button 1673, or any
     other suitable button for downloading files to a local
     device.   If desired, the system may convert file
     formats for files that are downloaded (e.g., convert
     JPG files to MPEG files) and/or may provide digital to
20   analog format conversions. Additionally, the user may
    be presented with view file option 1661, which may
     allow the user to view files located in the file search
    on the user equipment.     See also "view on your TV"
    option 1533 of FIG. 15A, which essentially provides the
25  same functionality.
                For clarity and brevity, the features of the
    systems that are described herein are primarily
    discussed in the context of video-on-demand services.
    The features may also be implemented with other types
30  of media on-demand services.      Media on-demand services
    may be used to mass distribute movies, programs,       music
    albums, etc. to users.     User equipment and remote
    network servers may be configured for users to store
    personal media such as photographs, home videos, old

                             - 37
   recordings, or other media on a remote server for on
   demand access by the user at a later time.  The user as
   described above may associate desired access rights with
   the media that the user stores on the remote server.
 5      Some or all of the features that are described
   herein may be implemented as part of an interactive
   television program guide, as part of a media on-demand
   application, as part of a dedicated application for those
   features; or implemented using a combination of such
10 applications.
        If desired, in connection with the relocate feature,
   the system may prompt a user to select whether to freeze
   on-demand-media of the user when the user is logging out
   of the system.  Also, if desired, in connection with the
15 relocate feature, the system may allow the user to resume
   the presentation of on-demand-media from a different
   point than the point at which the on-demand media may
   have been frozen.  For example, the system may provide
   the user with an option to resume the presentation of on
20 demand media from the beginning of the media when the
   user relocates and exercise the relocate feature.   The
   system may further allow the user to rewind the media
   past the point at which the media frozen.
        The foregoing is merely illustrative of the
25 principles of this invention and various modifications
   may be made by those skilled in the art without departing
   from the scope and spirit of the invention.
        Throughout this specification, including the claims,
   where the context permits, the term "comprise" and
30 variants thereof such as "comprises" or "comprising" are
   to be interpreted as including the stated integer or
   integers without necessarily excluding any other
   integers.
