                                         ABSTRACT
           A method for deleting a region of DNA in a plant. In some embodiments, the
   method comprises transforming a plant with a nucleic acid molecule, wherein the
   nucleic acid molecule encodes one or more zinc finger nuclease(s) (ZFNs) operably
 5 linked to one or more tissue-specific promoter(s), e.g., a pollen-specific promoter.
   Methods include excising native genes in a plant. Accordingly, in some embodiments,
   ZFNs are engineered that recognize sequences that flank native plant genes. In further
   embodiments, ZFNs are expressed under the control of developmental stage-specific
   promoters, such that, for example, nucleic acid sequences are specifically excised in
10 plants during relatively late stages of development. Nucleic acid molecules useful for
   carrying out disclosed methods and plants produced by the methods are included.

                                           PRIORITY CLAIM
              This application is a divisional of AU 2015202859, which is a divisional of AU
 5 2011207387, which in turn claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial
   No. 61/297,628, filed January 22, 2010, titled "Excision of Transgenes in Genetically
   Modified Organisms", the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

              Reference to any prior art in the specification is not an acknowledgment or
10  suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in any
   jurisdiction or that this prior art could reasonably be expected to be understood, regarded
    as relevant, and/or combined with other pieces of prior art by a skilled person in the art.
              The invention generally relates to compositions and methods for generating
   transgenic plants. In certain embodiments, the transgenic plants comprise one or more
15 transgenes of interest. In certain embodiments, excision of transgene(s) is directed in
   pollen and/or seed, such that the pollen and/or seed produced by a transgenic plant of the
    invention is substantially free of transgene(s). In some embodiments, transgenic plants of
   the invention are useful, for example, in achieving bioconfinement of transgene(s) of
    interest in the transgenic plant. In other embodiments, the excision of the transgene is
20  directed to a specific expression cassette, such as a selectable marker, such that only this
    expression cassette is removed from the transgenic plant and/or progeny of the transgenic
   plant.
                                             BACKGROUND
              Many plants are genetically transformed with genes from other species to introduce
25  desirable traits, such as to improve agricultural value through, e.g., improving nutritional
   value quality, increasing yield, conferring pest or disease resistance, increasing drought
    and stress tolerance, improving horticultural qualities such as pigmentation and growth,
    and/or imparting herbicide resistance; enabling the production of industrially useful
    compounds and/or materials from the plant; and/or enabling the production of
30 pharmaceuticals. The introduction of cloned genes into plant cells and recovery of stable
    fertile transgenic plants can be used to make such modifications of a plant, and has allowed
    desirable traits or qualities of interest to be incorporated into plants via genetic engineering
    (e.g., crop improvement). In these
    1001995842

                                                   -2
      methods, foreign DNA is typically introduced into the nuclear or plastid DNA of the
      eukaryotic plant cell, followed by isolation of cells containing the foreign DNA
      integrated into the cell's DNA, to produce stably transformed plant cells.
              One drawback that arises regarding the use of transgenic plants is the
  5   possibility of transgene escape to wild species and non-transformed species. These
     traits can increase the risk of outcrossing, persistence, and introgression of transgenes
      into an adjacent population. The escape of transgenes from genetically modified (GM)
      crops usually occurs through gene flow, mainly by cross-pollination (Lu (2003) Eviron.
     Biosafety Res. 2:3-8), but may also occur through introgression. Stewart Jr. et al.
 10  (2003) Nat. Reviews Gen. 4:806-17. Crop-to-crop gene flow will result in
     contamination of non-GM varieties, affecting the strategic deployment of transgenic
     and non-transgenic crop varieties in a given agricultural system. Significant
     contamination of non-GM crops with transgenic material poses difficulties in
     international trade because of legal restrictions on imports of transgenic products by
 15  many countries. Crop-to-crop gene flow can cause stacking of transgenes in hybrids
     that may potentially become volunteer weeds if the transgenes impart multiple
     resistance (e.g., to herbicides, pests, and/or diseases). Additionally, crop-to-crop gene
     flow will lead to transgene escape into weedy populations or related wild species,
     which may pose serious weed problems and other ecological risks if the transgenes
20   persist and establish in the weedy/wild populations through sexual reproduction and/or
     vegetative propagation. This is a particular concern when escaped genes enhance the
     ecological fitness of the weedy/wild species. Introgression of a crop transgene occurs
     in steps involving several successive hybrid generations. Introgression is a dynamic
    process that may take many years and generations before the transgene is fixed in the
25  genetic background of a receiving species and, thus, presents difficulties of detection
    and monitoring. However, if selection is strong and/or population size is small,
    fixation of an introgressed gene may occur rapidly.
              Containment of a specific expression cassette within genetically modified
    plants, especially a selectable marker expression cassette, is an elusive goal. Selectable
30  marker genes are usually antibiotic resistant or herbicide tolerant genes, but may
    include reporter genes (i.e., B-glucuronidase (Graham et al. (1989) PlantCell Tiss.
    Org. 20(l):35-39). Selectable makers which are co-transferred into the genome of a

                                                   -3
     plant provide a selective advantage and allow for the identification of stably
     transformed transgenic plants. The availability of functional selectable maker genes
     which can be used for the transformation of plants is somewhat limited. A review of
     the published scientific literature on transgenic crop plants reveals that the most widely
  5  used selective agents for antibiotic resistance are for kanamycin (encoded by the
     neomycin phosphotransferasetype II gene (Bevan et al. (1983) Nature 304:184-1 87))
     or hygromycin (encoded by the hygromycin phosphotransferasegene (Waldron et al.,
     PlantMol. Biol. 5:103-108)), and herbicide tolerance is phosphinothricin resistance
     (encoded by the pat (Wohlleben et al. (1988) Gene 70:25-37) or bar genes (DeBlock et
 10  al. (1987), EMBO J 6 (9):2513-2518)). See, Sundar et al. (2008)1 PlantPhysiol.
     165:1698-1716. Given the limited number of selectable marker genes and the common
     use of a sub-set of these traits, a solution that allows for the excision and re-use of
     selectable markers within a transgenic plant would obviate the need for additional
     selectable makers in subsequent rounds of gene transfer or gene stacking into the same
 15 plant. Moreover, the ability to excise a selectable marker could overcome unintended
     changes to the plant transcriptome that are caused by the expression of the marker
     (Abdeen et al. (2009) PlantBiotechnol. J 7(3):211-218).
             Current strategies to prevent or minimize gene flow between GM crops and
    other species and varieties include: (1) physical isolation of the transgenic crop; (2)
20  chloroplast engineering of transgenes; (3) co-engineering of a mitigation gene along
    with the transgene; (4) genetic use restriction technologies (GURTs); (5) CRE/loxP and
    FLP/FRTrecombinase-mediated gene deletion. See, e.g., Lee and Natesan (2006)
     TRENDS Biotech. 24(3):109-14; Lu (2003), supra; and Luo et al. (2007), Plant
    Biotech. J. 5:263-74; and (6) meganuclease - mediated gene deletion. See, e.g, U.S.
25  Patent Application No. 11/910,515; and U.S. Patent Application No. 12/600,902.
             CRE, FLP, and R recombinases have been exploited for the excision of
    unwanted genetic material from plants. Hare and Chua (2002) Nat. Biotech.
    20:575-80. Luo et al. (2007), supra,reported a pollen- and seed-specific
    "GM-gene-deletor" system, wherein use of loxP-FRT fusion sequences as recognition
30  sites for excision of transgenes by CRE or FLP recombinase led to deletion of
    transgenes from pollen, or from both pollen and seed, of transgenic tobacco plants. All
    these site-specific recombinase systems shown to function in plants are members of the

                                                -4
     integrase family. These systems have been chosen for use, at least in part, due to the
     fact that other recombinases may require ancillary proteins and more complex
     recognition sites that may confer topological restraints on recombination efficiencies.
     Id. These systems have several significant drawbacks: integrase-type recombinases
  5  may also recognize "pseudo-sequences," which may be highly divergent from a
     specific target sequence and, therefore, lead to unwanted non-specific DNA deletions;
     and excision of a target sequence leaves a residual recognition sequence that may be
     sites of chromosomal rearrangements upon subsequent exposure to the recombinase, or
     activate gene silencing mechanisms. Id. Moreover, these systems are further
 10  constrained as a functional recombinase must be present and expressed in one of the
     parent plants, the presence of which requires additional strategies for deletion within
     pollen and/or seed. Despite these limitations, the CREl/loxP system is recognized as
     the most suitable strategy for optimization of gene deletion in plants. Id.
              Custom-designed zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) are proteins designed to deliver
 15  a targeted site-specific double-strand break in DNA, with subsequent recombination of
     the cleaved ends. ZFNs combine the non-specific cleavage domain of FokI restriction
     endonuclease with zinc finger DNA-binding proteins. See, e.g., Huang et al. (1996) J
    Protein Chem. 15:481-9; Kim et al. (1997) Proc.Natl. Acad Sci. USA 94:3616-20;
     Kim et al. (1996) Proc.Natl. Acad Sci. USA 93:1156-60; Kim et al. (1994) Proc.Nat.
20  Acad Sci. USA 91:883-7; Kim et al. (1997b) Proc.Nat. Acad Sci. USA 94:12875-9;
    Kim et al. (1997c) Gene 203:43-9; Kim et al. (1998) Biol. Chem. 379:489-95; Nahon
    and Raveh (1998) Nucleic Acids Res. 26:1233-9; Smith et al. (1999) Nucleic Acids Res.
    27:674-81. Individual zinc finger motifs can be designed to target and bind to a large
    range of DNA sites. Cys 2His 2 zinc finger proteins bind DNA by inserting an a-helix
25  into the major groove of the double helix. Recognition of DNA by zinc fingers is
    modular: each finger contacts primarily three consecutive base pairs in the target, and
    a few key residues in the protein mediate recognition. It has been shown that FokI
    restriction endonuclease must dimerize via the nuclease domain in order to cleave
    DNA, inducing a double-strand break. Similarly, ZFNs also require dimerization of
30  the nuclease domain in order to cut DNA. Mani et al. (2005) Biochem. Biophys. Res.
    Commun. 334:1191-7; Smith et al. (2000) Nucleic Acids Res. 28:3361-9. Dimerization
    of the ZFN is facilitated by two adjacent, oppositely oriented binding sites. Id. In

                                                 -5
     addition, double strand breaks caused by zinc finger nucleases are resolved by the
     plants DNA repair machinery via either nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or
     homology directed repair (HDR), thereby resulting in plants which are free of
     residual recognition sequences.

                                           DISCLOSURE
             According to an embodiment of the invention, a method for deleting a region of
     DNA in a plant wherein a viable plant containing a genomic DNA, the genomic DNA
     comprising the region of DNA, is provided; and a zinc finger nuclease, engineered to
 10  cleave the genomic DNA at a recognition sequence, is expressed or introduced in the
     viable plant containing the genomic DNA; thereby resulting in cleavage of the genomic
     DNA at recognition sequences resulting in the excision of the genomic DNA, wherein
     the region of DNA is absent from the genomic DNA.
             In another embodiment, a method for deleting a region of DNA in a plant
 15  includes providing a first viable plant containing a genomic DNA, the genomic DNA
     comprising the region of DNA and a first recognition sequence flanking the 3' end and
     a second recognition sequence flanking the 5' end of the region of DNA. A second
    viable plant containing a genomic DNA is provided, the genomic DNA comprising a
     DNA encoding a zinc finger nuclease engineered to cleave the genomic DNA at the
20  recognition sequences. The first and second viable plants are crossed such that F1 seed
    is produced on either the first or the second viable plant. A resultant F1 plant
    containing a genomic DNA is grown, wherein the region of DNA is absent from the
    genomic DNA. In certain embodiments, the first recognition sequence and the second
    recognition sequence can be identical.
25           In a particular embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes: a first
    nucleic acid sequence recognized by a zinc finger nuclease; a gene of interest; and a
    second nucleic acid sequence recognized by a zinc finger nuclease, wherein the gene of
    interest is flanked by the first and second nucleic acid sequences recognized by a zinc
    finger nuclease. In another embodiment, the first recognition sequence and the second
30  recognition sequence can be flanked by homologous sequences. In yet another
    embodiment, a method of producing a transgenic plant includes transforming a plant

                                                  -6
     cell or plant tissue with the isolated nucleic acid molecule and regenerating a whole
     plant.
               In an additional embodiment, a method for reducing the transmission of a gene
     of interest to other plants includes crossing the whole plant with a plant regenerated
  5  from a plant cell or tissue transformed with an isolated nucleic acid molecule
     comprising a pollen-specific promoter operably linked to a zinc finger nuclease,
     wherein the gene of interest is specifically excised in pollen of the progeny resulting
     from the cross. The progeny resulting from the cross are cultivated. In such
     embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a promoter and a nucleic acid
 10  sequence encoding a zinc finger nuclease, wherein the promoter is operably linked to
     the nucleic acid sequence encoding the zinc finger nuclease and the method of
     producing a transgenic plant that includes transforming a plant cell or plant tissue with
    the isolated nucleic acid molecule and regenerating a whole plant.
              In an embodiment, a method for deleting a region of DNA in a plant containing
 15  a nucleic acid molecule including: a first nucleic acid sequence recognized by a zinc
     finger nuclease; a selectable marker gene expression cassette; and a second nucleic acid
     sequence recognized by a zinc finger nuclease, wherein the selectable marker is
    flanked by the first and second nucleic acid sequences recognized by a zinc finger
    nuclease. . In another embodiment, the first recognition sequence and the second
20  recognition sequence are flanked by homologous sequences. Additionally, a zinc
    finger nuclease, engineered to cleave the genomic DNA at a recognition sequence, is
    expressed or introduced in the viable plant cell; thereby resulting in cleavage of the
    genomic DNA at recognition sequences resulting in the excision of the genomic DNA,
    wherein the selectable marker is absent from the genomic DNA.
25            In another embodiment, each half of the zinc finger nuclease monomer is
    expressed separately and when paired in conjunction with one another form a
    functional complex. For example, a plant transcription unit which expresses one zinc
    finger nuclease monomer (consisting of a zinc finger binding motif operably linked to
    the FokI endonuclease) is stably integrated into one parent, P1, and a plant transcription
30  unit which expresses a second monomer is stably integrated into a second parent, P2.
    The sexual cross of P1 x P2 results in progeny plants which contain both zinc finger
    monomers. The resulting zinc finger nuclease dimer is capable of binding to a zinc

                                                -7
     finger binding site and forming a complex which has cleavage activity. Given that the
     FokI endonuclease is active as a dimer (Bitinaite et al. (1998) Proc.Natl. A cad.Sci.
      USA 95:10,570-10,575), the cleavage activity is only capable of occurring within
     progeny which contain both functionally expressing monomers.
  5           In another embodiment, the excision by a zinc finger nuclease at a recognition
     sequence results in the formation of a cleavage junction, which is free of a residual
     recognition sequence. The cleavage junction may not be bound and cleaved by the
     original zinc finger nuclease(s). Additionally, the cleavage junction can be the result of
     non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or the result of homology directed repair between
 10  two homologous regions of DNA which are located upstream of the 5' recognition
     sequence and downstream of the 3' recognition sequence or the result of another
     undescribed DNA repair mechanism. A homologous sequence can be placed outside
     binding sites so that after cleavage, homology directed repair can occur. This is an
     improvement over recombinase systems, which always leave behind a remnant of the
 15  site used to get the excision.
             In yet another embodiment, a method of excising a native gene of interest in a
    plant includes transforming a plant cell or tissue comprising a gene of interest with an
    isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a zinc
    finger nuclease or an isolated protein sequence which encodes a zinc finger nuclease,
20  wherein the zinc finger nuclease recognizes a nucleic acid sequence flanking the native
    gene of interest and the native gene of interest is specifically excised. A whole plant is
    then regenerated. In an alternative embodiment, endogenous gene excision can be
    accomplished by crossing a plant expressing a zinc finger nuclease with a target plant.

                       MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION
 10           Disclosed herein is a method to excise genes from specific plant tissue in
     genetically modified organisms. In some embodiments, one or more ZFNs (zinc finger
     nuclease) are used to remove transgenes from specific plant tissue as a means of
     reducing gene flow into non-GM crops. In some embodiments, the transgene that is
     removed is a selectable marker gene cassette. In certain embodiments, the specific
 15  plant tissue is pollen.
              In some embodiments, one or more ZFNs may be operably linked to different
     tissue-specific promoters. In these and further embodiments, one of the one or more
     ZFNs operably linked to a tissue-specific promoter may be transformed into one parent
    plant line, and another of the one or more ZFNs operably linked to a different
20  tissue-specific promoter may be transformed into a second parent plant line. A cross
    between the parental lines containing each of the one or more ZFNs can produce an F1
    line that contains a functional ZFN that cleaves DNA at a recognition sequence. The
    recognition sequences may flank transgenes in the DNA of the plant.
              Tissue-specific gene excision may be achieved by operable linkage of
25  tissue-specific plant promoters to ZFNs. In some embodiments, operable linkage of a
    tissue-specific promoter to one or more ZFNs leads to tissue-specific expression of the
    one or more ZFNs, thereby excising the ZFNs, selectable markers, and/or any genes or
    nucleic acid sequences located between the recognition sequences in the specific tissue.
             In particular embodiments, one or more ZFNs are expressed within the same
30  plant. ZFNs may be operably linked to promoters that drive expression of the ZFNs
    during later developmental stages of a plant. In these and other embodiments, one or
    more functional ZFNs may cleave specific recognition sequences that flank one or

                                                  - 11
     more transgene(s), thereby removing the one or more transgenes from plant tissue
     during later stages of plant development.

     Terms
             Gene expression: The process by which the coded information of a nucleic
     acid transcriptional unit (including, e.g., genomic DNA or cDNA) is converted into an
     operational, non-operational, or structural part of a cell, often including the synthesis of
 15  a protein. Gene expression can be influenced by external signals; for example,
     exposure of a cell, tissue, or organism to an agent that increases or decreases gene
     expression. Expression of a gene can also be regulated anywhere in the pathway from
    DNA to RNA to protein. Regulation of gene expression occurs, for example, through
    controls acting on transcription, translation, RNA transport and processing, degradation
20  of intermediary molecules such as mRNA, or through activation, inactivation,
    compartmentalization, or degradation of specific protein molecules after they have
    been made, or by combinations thereof. Gene expression can be measured at the RNA
    level or the protein level by any method known in the art, including, without limitation,
    Northern blot, RT-PCR, Western blot, or in vitro, in situ, or in vivo protein activity
25  assay(s).
             Hybridization: Oligonucleotides and their analogs hybridize by hydrogen
    bonding, which includes Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen
    bonding, between complementary bases. Generally, nucleic acid molecules consist of
    nitrogenous bases that are either pyrimidines (cytosine (C), uracil (U), and thymine
30  (T)) or purines (adenine (A) and guanine (G)). These nitrogenous bases form hydrogen
    bonds between a pyrimidine and a purine, and the bonding of the pyrimidine to the
    purine is referred to as "base pairing." More specifically, A will hydrogen bond to T or

                                               - 12
     U, and G will bond to C. "Complementary" refers to the base pairing that occurs
    between two distinct nucleic acid sequences or two distinct regions of the same nucleic
     acid sequence.
             "Specifically hybridizable" and "specifically complementary" are terms that
  5 indicate a sufficient degree of complementarity such that stable and specific binding
    occurs between the oligonucleotide and the DNA or RNA target. The oligonucleotide
    need not be 100% complementary to its target sequence to be specifically hybridizable.
    An oligonucleotide is specifically hybridizable when binding of the oligonucleotide to
    the target DNA or RNA molecule interferes with the normal function of the target
 10 DNA or RNA, and there is sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific
    binding of the oligonucleotide to non-target sequences under conditions where specific
    binding is desired, for example under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo
    assays or systems. Such binding is referred to as specific hybridization.
             Hybridization conditions resulting in particular degrees of stringency will vary
 15 depending upon the nature of the hybridization method of choice and the composition
    and length of the hybridizing nucleic acid sequences. Generally, the temperature of
    hybridization and the ionic strength (especially the Na* and/or Mg+ concentration) of
    the hybridization buffer will contribute to the stringency of hybridization, though wash
    times also influence stringency. Calculations regarding hybridization conditions
20  required for attaining particular degrees of stringency are discussed in Sambrook et al.
    (ed.), Molecular Cloning: A LaboratoryManual, 2nd ed., vol. 1-3, Cold Spring
    Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989, chs. 9 and 11.
            For purposes of the present disclosure, "stringent conditions" encompass
    conditions under which hybridization will occur if there is less than 25% mismatch
25  between the hybridization molecule and the target sequence. "Stringent conditions"
    can be further defined into particular levels of stringency. Thus, as used herein,
    "moderate stringency" conditions are those under which molecules with more than
    25% mismatch will not hybridize; conditions of "medium stringency" are those under
    which molecules with more than 15% mismatch will not hybridize, and conditions of
30  "high stringency" are those under which sequence with more than 10% mismatch will
    not hybridize. Conditions of "very high stringency" are those under which sequences
    with more than 6% mismatch will not hybridize.

                                                  - 13
              In particular embodiments, stringent conditions are hybridization at 65'C,
     followed by sequential washes at 65'C with 0.1x SSC/0.1% SDS for 40 minutes.
              Isolated: An "isolated" biological component (such as a nucleic acid or
     protein) has been substantially separated, produced apart from, or purified away from
  5  other biological components in the cell of the organism in which the component
     naturally occurs, i.e., other chromosomal and extra-chromosomal DNA and RNA, and
     proteins. Nucleic acid molecules and proteins that have been "isolated" include nucleic
     acid molecules and proteins purified by standard purification methods. The term also
     embraces nucleic acids and proteins prepared by recombinant expression in a host cell,
 10  as well as chemically synthesized nucleic acid molecules, proteins, and peptides.
             Nucleic acid molecule: A polymeric form of nucleotides, which can include
     both sense and anti-sense strands of RNA, cDNA, genomic DNA, and synthetic forms
     and mixed polymers of the above. A nucleotide refers to a ribonucleotide,
     deoxynucleotide, or a modified form of either type of nucleotide. A "nucleic acid
 15  molecule" as used herein is synonymous with "nucleic acid" and "polynucleotide."
    The term includes single- and double-stranded forms of DNA. A nucleic acid
    molecule can include either or both naturally occurring and modified nucleotides
    linked together by naturally occurring and/or non-naturally occurring nucleotide
    linkages.
20           Nucleic acid molecules may be modified chemically or biochemically, or may
    contain non-natural or derivatized nucleotide bases, as will be readily appreciated by
    those of skill in the art. Such modifications include, for example, labels, methylation,
    substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog,
    internucleotide modifications, such as uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates,
25  phosphotriesters, phosphoramidates, carbamates, etc.), charged linkages (e.g,
    phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), pendent moieties (e.g., peptides),
    intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), chelators, alkylators, and modified linkages
    (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.). The term "nucleic acid molecule" also
    includes any topological conformation, including single-stranded, double-stranded,
30  partially duplexed, triplexed, hairpinned, circular, and padlocked conformations.
             Operably linked: A first nucleic acid sequence is operably linked with a second
    nucleic acid sequence when the first nucleic acid sequence is in a functional

                                                   - 14
     relationship with the second nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter is
     operably linked with a coding sequence when the promoter affects the transcription or
     expression of the coding sequence. When recombinantly produced, operably linked
     nucleic acid sequences are generally contiguous and, where necessary to join two
  5  protein-coding regions, in the same reading frame. However, elements need not be
     contiguous to be operably linked.
              Promoter: A region of DNA that generally is located upstream (towards the 5'
     region of a gene) that is needed for transcription. Promoters permit the proper
     activation or repression of the gene which they control. A promoter contains specific
 10  sequences that are recognized by transcription factors. These factors bind to the
     promoter DNA sequences and result in the recruitment of RNA polymerase, the
     enzyme that synthesizes the RNA from the coding region of the gene. In some
     embodiments, tissue-specific promoters are used in methods of the invention, e.g., a
     pollen-specific promoter. A tissue-specific promoter is a DNA sequence that directs a
 15  higher level of transcription of an associated gene in the tissue for which the promoter
     is specific relative to the other tissues of the organism. Examples of tissue-specific
     promoters include tapetum-specific promoters; anther-specific promoters;
     pollen-specific promoters (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,141,424, and International PCT
     Publication No. WO 99/042587); ovule-specific promoters; (see, e.g., U.S. Patent
20  Application No. 2001/047525 A1); fruit-specific promoters (See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos.
    4,943,674, and 5,753,475); and seed-specific promoters (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos.
     5,420,034, and 5,608,152). In some embodiments, developmental stage-specific
    promoters are used in methods of the invention, e.g., a promoter active at a later stage
    in development.
25           Transformed: A virus or vector "transforms" or "transduces" a cell when it
    transfers nucleic acid molecules into the cell. A cell is "transformed" by a nucleic acid
    molecule transduced into the cell when the nucleic acid molecule becomes stably
    replicated by the cell, either by incorporation of the nucleic acid molecule into the
    cellular genome, or by episomal replication. As used herein, the term "transformation"
30  encompasses all techniques by which a nucleic acid molecule can be introduced into
    such a cell. Examples include, but are not limited to, transfection with viral vectors,
    transformation with plasmid vectors, electroporation (Fromm et al. (1986) Nature

                                                 - 15
     319:791-3), lipofection (Felgner et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 84:7413-7),
     microinjection (Mueller et al. (1978) Cell 15:579-85), Agrobacterium-mediated
     transfer (Fraley et al. (1983) Proc.Natl. Acad Sci. USA 80:4803-7), direct DNA
     uptake, and microprojectile bombardment (Klein et al. (1987) Nature 327:70).
  5          Transgene: An exogenous nucleic acid sequence. In one example, a transgene
     is a gene sequence (e.g., a herbicide-resistance gene), a gene encoding an industrially
     or pharmaceutically useful compound, or a gene encoding a desirable agricultural trait.
     In yet another example, the transgene is an antisense nucleic acid sequence, wherein
     expression of the antisense nucleic acid sequence inhibits expression of a target nucleic
 10  acid sequence. A transgene may contain regulatory sequences operably linked to the
    transgene (e.g., a promoter).
             Vector: A nucleic acid molecule as introduced into a cell, thereby producing a
    transformed cell. A vector can include nucleic acid sequences that permit it to replicate
    in the host cell, such as an origin of replication. Examples include, but are not limited
15  to, a plasmid, cosmid, bacteriophage, or virus that carries exogenous DNA into a cell.
    A vector can also include one or more genes, antisense molecules, and/or selectable
    marker genes and other genetic elements known in the art. A vector can transduce,
    transform, or infect a cell, thereby causing the cell to express the nucleic acid
    molecules and/or proteins encoded by the vector. A vector optionally includes
20  materials to aid in achieving entry of the nucleic acid molecule into the cell (e.g., a
    liposome, protein coding, etc.).
    Zn-finger nuclease-mediated excision of transgenes from plants
             Disclosed herein are methods for producing a plant having decreased transgene
25  escape, as well as plants produced by such methods, and plant materials derived
    therefrom, e.g., seeds. In one embodiment, the method comprises contacting a plant
    with a vector, wherein the vector includes one or more zinc finger nuclease(s) (ZFNs)
    operably linked to one or more tissue-specific promoter(s) (e.g., a pollen-specific
    promoter). Expression of this vector results in the production of the ZFN(s) in the
30  specific tissue wherein its operably linked promoter is active. The ZFN(s) may be
    designed or engineered to recognize a cleavage sequence that flanks a nucleic acid
    sequence, the excision of which is desired. Production of the ZFN(s), then, in the

                                                - 16
     specific tissue wherein the promoter is active, results in excision of the nucleic acid
     sequence between the cleavage sequences recognized by the ZFN(s), thereby
     producing a nucleic acid sequence that contains a cleavage junction that is free of a
     residual recognition sequence.
  5            In another embodiment, the method comprises: contacting a plant with a
     vector, wherein the vector includes one or more ZFN(s) operably linked to a
     tissue-specific promoter; a gene of interest; optionally one or more regulatory
     element(s) that may be operably linked to the gene of interest; and one or more
     cleavage sequences recognized by the ZFN(s) flanking the gene of interest and the one
 10  or more regulatory element(s). Expression of this vector results in the production of
     the ZFN(s) in the specific tissue wherein its operably linked promoter is active.
     Production of the ZFN(s), then, in the specific tissue wherein the promoter is active
     results in excision of the nucleic acid sequence between the cleavage sequences
     recognized by the ZFN(s), which includes the gene of interest and, optionally, the one
15   or more regulatory element(s).
              In further embodiments, the method comprises contacting a plant with a vector,
     wherein the vector includes one or more zinc finger nuclease(s) (ZFNs) operably
     linked to one or more promoter(s) active at a particular period of plant development
     (e.g., a promoter that drives expression at a relatively late stage of development).
20   Expression of this vector results in the production of the ZFN(s) during the specific
    period of development wherein its operably linked promoter is active. The ZFN(s)
    may be designed or engineered to recognize a cleavage sequence that flanks a nucleic
     acid sequence, the excision of which is desired. Production of the ZFN(s) at the
    developmental stage wherein the promoter is active, results in excision of the nucleic
25  acid sequence between the cleavage sequences recognized by the ZFN(s).
              In still further embodiments, the method comprises: contacting a plant with a
    vector, wherein the vector includes one or more ZFN(s) operably linked to a promoter
    active at a particular period of plant development; a gene of interest; optionally one or
    more regulatory element(s) that may be operably linked to the gene of interest; and one
30  or more cleavage sequences recognized by the ZFN(s) flanking the gene of interest and
    the one or more regulatory element(s). Expression of this vector results in the
    production of the ZFN(s) during the specific period of development wherein its

                                                -17
     operably linked promoter is active. Production of the ZFN(s) during the specific period
     of development wherein its operably linked promoter is active, results in excision of
    the nucleic acid sequence between the cleavage sequences recognized by the ZFN(s),
     which includes the gene of interest and the one or more regulatory element(s).
  5
     ZFN nucleases
             In particular embodiments, ZFNs are expressed from nucleic acid molecules in
    transformed plants to direct the excision of nucleic acid sequences in the transformed
    plants. ZFNs may be used that target a recognition sequence engineered to flank a
 10 particular nucleic acid sequence (e.g., a transgene, gene of interest, or selectable marker
    gene) or ZFNs may be designed to target a naturally occurring nucleic acid sequence
    flanking a particular nucleic acid sequence to be excised. The exquisite flexibility and
    specificity of the ZFN system provides a level of control previously unachievable by
    known recombinase-mediated gene excision strategies.
 15          Recognition specificities of ZFNs can be easily manipulated experimentally.
    Wu et al. (2007) Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 64:2933-44. Randomization of the codons for zinc
    finger recognition residues allows the selection of new fingers that have high affinity
    for arbitrarily chosen DNA sequences. Furthermore, zinc fingers are natural
    DNA-binding molecules, and engineered zinc fingers have been shown to act on their
20  designed targets in living cells. Thus, nucleases based on zinc fingers are targetable to
    specific but arbitrary recognition sites.
             The requirement for dimerization of cleavage domains of chimeric zinc finger
    nucleases imparts a high level of sequence specificity. Since each set of three fingers
    binds nine consecutive base pairs, two chimeric nucleases effectively demand an 18 bp
25  target if each zinc finger domain has perfect specificity. Any given sequence of this
    length is predicted to be unique within a single genome (assuming approximately 109
    bp). Bibikova et al. (2001) Mol. Cell. Biol. 21(1):289-97; Wu et al. (2007), supra.
    Furthermore, additional fingers provide enhanced specificity, Beerli et al. (1998) Proc.
    Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:14628-33; Kim and Pabo (1998) Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
30  95:2812-7; Liu et al. (1997) Proc.Natl.Acad Sci. USA 94:5525-30, so the number of
    zinc fingers in each DNA-binding domain may be increased to provide even further
    specificity. For example, specificity may be further increased by using a pair of

                                               - 18
    4-finger ZFNs that recognize a 24 bp sequence. Urnov et al. (2005) Nature
    435:646-51.
             Key amino acids in ZFNs, at positions -1, 2, 3, and 6 relative to the start of the
    a-helix, contribute most of the specific interactions by the zinc finger motifs. Pavletich
  5 and Pabo (1991) Science 252:809-17; Shi and Berg (1995) Chem. Biol. 2:83-9. These
     amino acids can be changed, while maintaining the remaining amino acids as a
    consensus backbone, to generate ZFPs with different and/or novel sequence
     specificities. See, e.g., Choo and Klug (1994) Proc. Natl.Acad Sci. USA 91:11163-7;
    Desjarlais and Berg (1992) Proc. Natl.Acad Sci. USA 89:7345-9; Desjarlais and Berg
10  (1993) Proc.Natl. Acad Sci. USA 90:2256-60; Greisman and Pabo (1997) Science
    275:657-61; Isalan et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37:12026-33; Jamieson et al. (1994)

    285:1917-34; Wu et al. (1995) Proc.Nat. Acad Sci. USA 92:344-8. Moreover, at
15  least two 3-finger ZFNs with different sequence specificities can be designed, such that
    they collaborate to produce cleavage. Smith et al. (2000), supra.
             Design and selection approaches for constructing a ZFN of the invention may
    begin by determining one or more appropriate ZF motifs to recognize a specific nucleic
    acid sequence. Alternatively, a ZFN that recognizes a specific nucleic acid sequence
20  may be used to construct a nucleic acid molecule comprising the specific nucleic acid
    sequence (e.g., wherein the specific nucleic acid sequence flanks a gene of interest) and
    other elements as needed. Design and various selection approaches for ZFPs,
    including the phage display method, have been reviewed. Mani et al. (2005), supra;
    Durai et al. (2005) Nucleic Acids Res. 33:5978-90; Isalan et al. (2001) Nat. Biotechnol.

    Annu. Rev. Biochem. 70:313-40; Segal et al. (2003) Biochemistry 42:2137-48. Any
    design and/or selection approach known in the art may be used to arrive at a ZFN for
    use in embodiments of the present invention. For example, cell-based selection
    strategies using bacterial one-hybrid and two-hybrid systems may be used to produce
30  highly specific ZFPs. Durai et al. (2006) Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen.

    (2000) Proc.Natl. A cad Sci. USA 97:7382-7. Highly specific ZFPs can also be

                                                -19
     obtained by directed domain shuffling and cell-based selection, which offers a general
     approach for optimizing multi-finger ZFPs. Hurt et al. (2003), supra.
              A wealth of data based on design and phage display methodologies is available
     for ZF modules that specifically recognize 5' GNN 3' and 5' ANN 3' triplets, and to a
  5  lesser extent, the ZF motif preferences for 5' CNN 3' and 5' TNN 3' triplets are known.
     See, e.g., Durai et al. (2005), supra; Dreieret al. (2001) J Biol. Chem. 276:29466-78;

     303:489-502; Liu et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277:3850-6. Currently, two Web-based
     ZF design software packages are available (e.g., at zincfingertools.org). The foregoing
 10  renders nearly all genes encoded in a genome amenable to ZFN-mediated gene
     targeting. Katada and Komiyama (2009) Chembiochem. 10(8):1279-88.
              In particular embodiments, a ZFN is used that binds the HIV co-receptor
     CCR5. Perez et al. (2008) Nat. Biotechnol. 26:808-16. This ZFN is termed the "CCR5
     ZFN." In particular embodiments, the CCR5 ZFN coding region comprises: the
 15  opaque-2 nuclear localization sequence (Maddaloni et al. (1989) Nucleic Acids Res.
     17(18):7532); the r162yl 1 zinc finger binding domain, the FokI nuclease domain
     (Looney et al. (1989) Gene 80:193-208); a T2A stutter sequence (Mattion et al. (1996)
    J Virol. 70:8124-7) derived from the Thesoa assignavirus; a second opaque-2 nuclear
     localization sequence, the 168FA vE zinc finger binding domain; and a second FokI
20  nuclease domain.
    Nucleic acid molecules
             In some embodiments, the method includes crossing a first plant having one or
    more genes of interest (which may confer a desirable trait or phenotype), such as two
25  or more genes of interest, with a second plant. The second plant may also have one or
    more genes of interest. The first plant may include a vector, wherein the vector
    includes a promoter operably linked to one or more gene(s) of interest. The promoter
    may be a constitutive or inducible promoter. The nucleic acid sequence encoding a
    gene(s) of interest may be flanked by ZFN recognition sites. Optionally, the promoter
30  operably linked to the gene(s) of interest, and any additional nucleic acid sequences
    (e.g., regulatory sequences), may also be flanked by ZFN recognition sites. The second
    plant may include another vector, which may include a tissue-specific or

                                                 - 20
     development-specific promoter operably linked to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a
     ZFN. The vectors may be stably integrated into the genomes of both plants. After
     crossing the first and second plants, the tissue-specific or development-specific
     promoter specifically drives the expression of the ZFN in the resulting progeny of such
  5  a cross. Expression of the ZFN in these progeny leads to excision of nucleic acid
     sequences flanked by the ZFN recognition sites, thereby reducing or eliminating the
     gene of interest, and optionally additional sequences (such as selectable marker genes)
     in specific tissues and/or stages of development of the progeny. In some embodiments,
     the ZFN recognition sites may be further flanked by homologous nucleic acid
 10  sequences to further promote homologous DNA recombination.
              A gene of interest will typically be operably linked to one or more plant
     promoter(s) driving expression of the gene in an amount sufficient to confer a desired
     trait or phenotype. Promoters suitable for this and other uses are well known in the art.

     Nature 304:184-7), and the like.
              Additional genetic elements that may optionally be operably linked to a gene of
     interest include sequences coding for transit peptides. For example, incorporation of a
     suitable chloroplast transit peptide, such as the A. thalianaEPSPS CTP (Klee et al.
 10  (1987) Mol. Gen. Genet. 210:437-42), and the Petunia hybrida EPSPS CTP
     (della-Cioppa et al. (1986) Proc.Natl. A cad.Sci. USA 83:6873-7) has been shown to
     target heterologous EPSPS protein sequences to chloroplasts in transgenic plants.
     Dicamba monooxygenase (DMO) may also be targeted to chloroplasts, as described in
     International PCT Publication No. WO 2008/105890.
 15           Additional genetic elements that may optionally be operably linked to a gene of
    interest also include 5' UTRs located between a promoter sequence and a coding
    sequence that function as a translation leader sequence. The translation leader
    sequence is present in the fully processed mRNA upstream of the translation start
    sequence. The translation leader sequence may affect processing of the primary
20  transcript to mRNA, mRNA stability, and/or translation efficiency. Examples of
    translation leader sequences include maize and petunia heat shock protein leaders (U.S.
    Patent No. 5,362,865), plant virus coat protein leaders, plant rubisco leaders, and
    others. See, e.g., Turner and Foster (1995) Molecular Biotech. 3(3):225-36.
    Non-limiting examples of 5' UTRs include GmI-Jsp (U.S. Patent No. 5,659,122);
25  PhDnaK (U.S. Patent No. 5,362,865); AtAntl; TEV (Carrington and Freed (1990) J.
    Virol. 64:1590-7); and AGRtunos (GenBank Accession No. V00087; and Bevan et al.
    (1983) Nature 304:184-7).
             Additional genetic elements that may optionally be operably linked to a gene of
    interest also include 3' non-translated sequences, 3' transcription termination regions, or
30  poly-adenylation regions. These are genetic elements located downstream of a
    polynucleotide molecule, and include polynucleotides that provide polyadenylation
    signal, and/or other regulatory signals capable of affecting transcription, mRNA

                                                 - 22
     processing, or gene expression. The polyadenylation signal functions in plants to cause
     the addition of polyadenylate nucleotides to the 3' end of the mRNA precursor. The
     polyadenylation sequence can be derived from the natural gene, from a variety of plant
     genes, or from T-DNA genes. A non-limiting example of a 3' transcription termination
  5  region is the nopaline synthase 3' region (nos 3'; Fraley et al. (1983) Proc.Natl. Acad
     Sci. USA 80:4803-7). An example of the use of different 3' nontranslated regions is
     provided in Ingelbrecht et al., (1989) Plant Cell 1:671-80. Non-limiting examples of
     polyadenylation signals include one from a Pisum sativum RbcS2 gene (Ps.RbcS2-E9;
     Coruzzi et al. (1984) EMBO J. 3:1671-9) and AGRtu.nos (GenBank Accession No.
 10  E01312).
     Plant transformation
             Any of the techniques known in the art for introduction of transgenes into
    plants may be used to produce a transformed plant according to the invention. Suitable
15  methods for transformation of plants are believed to include virtually any method by
    which DNA can be introduced into a cell, such as: by electroporation as illustrated in
    U.S. Patent No. 5,384,253; by microprojectile bombardment, as illustrated in U.S.
    Patent Nos. 5,015,580, 5,550,318, 5,538,880, 6,160,208, 6,399,861, and 6,403,865; by
    Agrobacterium-mediatedtransformation as illustrated in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,635,055,
20  5,824,877, 5,591,616; 5,981,840, and 6,384,301; and by protoplast transformation, as
    set forth in U.S. Patent No. 5,508,184, etc. Through the application of techniques such
    as these, the cells of virtually any plant species may be stably transformed, and these
    cells may be developed into transgenic plants by techniques known to those of skill in
    the art. Techniques that may be particularly useful in the context of cotton
25  transformation are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,846,797, 5,159,135, 5,004,863, and
    6,624,344; techniques for transforming Brassicaplants in particular are disclosed, for
    example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,750,871; techniques for transforming soybean are
    disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 6,384,301; and techniques for transforming
    corn are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 7,060,876, U.S. Patent No.
30  5,591,616, and International PCT Publication WO 95/06722.
            After effecting delivery of exogenous DNA to recipient cells, the next steps
    generally concern identifying the transformed cells for further culturing and plant

                                                  - 23
     regeneration. In order to improve the ability to identify transformants, one may desire
     to employ a selectable or screenable marker gene with the transformation vector used
     to generate the transformant. In this case, the potentially transformed cell population
     can be assayed by exposing the cells to a selective agent or agents, or the cells can be
  5  screened for the desired marker gene trait.
              Cells that survive the exposure to the selective agent, or cells that have been
     scored positive in a screening assay, may be cultured in media that supports
     regeneration of plants. In some embodiments, any suitable plant tissue culture media
     (e.g., MS and N6 media) may be modified by including further substances, such as
 10  growth regulators. Tissue may be maintained on a basic media with growth regulators
     until sufficient tissue is available to begin plant regeneration efforts, or following
     repeated rounds of manual selection, until the morphology of the tissue is suitable for
     regeneration (e.g., at least 2 weeks), then transferred to media conducive to shoot
     formation. Cultures are transferred periodically until sufficient shoot formation has
 15  occurred. Once shoots are formed, they are transferred to media conducive to root
     formation. Once sufficient roots are formed, plants can be transferred to soil for further
     growth and maturity.
             To confirm the presence of a gene of interest (e.g, a transgene) in the
    regenerating plants, a variety of assays may be performed. Such assays include, for
20  example: molecular biological assays, such as Southern and Northern blotting and
    PCR; biochemical assays, such as detecting the presence of a protein product, e.g., by
    immunological means (ELISA and/or Western blots) or by enzymatic function; plant
    part assays, such as leaf or root assays; and analysis of the phenotype of the whole
    regenerated plant.
25
    Cultivation and use of transgenic plants
             A plant exhibiting nucleic acid excision according to the present invention may
    have one or more desirable traits, such as two or more desirable traits. Such traits can
    include, for example: resistance to insects and other pests and disease-causing agents;
30  tolerances to herbicides; enhanced stability, yield, or shelf-life; environmental
    tolerances; pharmaceutical production; industrial product production; and nutritional
    enhancements. The desirable traits may be conferred by genes flanked by nucleic acid

                                                - 24
     sequence recognized by ZFN(s) expressed in the plant exhibiting the desirable traits,
     such that expression of the ZFN(s) in the plant decreases or eliminates transmission of
     the trait, through containment of its underlying gene, to other plants or subsequent
     generations of the plant. Thus, in one embodiment, the desired trait can be due to the
  5  presence of a transgene(s) in the plant, which may be flanked by ZFN recognition
     sequences. In an additional embodiment, the desirable trait can be obtained through
     conventional breeding, which trait may be conferred by one or more genes flanked by
     ZFN recognition sequences.
              A plant exhibiting nucleic acid excision according to the invention may be any
 10  plant capable of being transformed with a nucleic acid molecule of the invention.
     Accordingly, the plant may be a dicot or monocot. Non-limiting examples of
     dicotyledonous plants usable in the present methods include alfalfa, beans, broccoli,
     cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, celery, Chinese cabbage, cotton, cucumber, eggplant,
     lettuce, melon, pea, pepper, peanut, potato, pumpkin, radish, rapeseed, spinach,
15   soybean, squash, sugarbeet, sunflower, tobacco, tomato, and watermelon.
     Non-limiting examples of monocotyledonous plants usable in the present methods
     include corn, onion, rice, sorghum, wheat, rye, millet, sugarcane, oat, triticale,
     switchgrass, and turfgrass.
              Plants exhibiting nucleic acid excision according to the invention may be used
20   or cultivated in any manner, wherein transmission of the excised nucleic acid sequence
    to other plants is undesirable. Accordingly, GM plants that have been engineered to,
     inter alia, have one or more desired traits, may be transformed with nucleic acid
    molecules according to the invention, and cropped and cultivated by any method
    known to those of skill in the art.

                                            EXAMPLES
              The following examples are included to illustrate embodiments of the
    invention. It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques
    disclosed in the Examples represent techniques discovered by the inventors to function
30  well in the practice of the invention. However, those of skill in the art will, in light of
    the present disclosure, can appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific
    embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without

                                               - 25
     departing from the scope of the invention. More specifically, it will be apparent that
     certain agents that are both chemically and physiologically related may be substituted
     for the agents described herein, while the same or similar results would be achieved.
     All such similar substitutes and modifications apparent to those skilled in the art are
  5  deemed to be within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended Claims.
                         Example I: Plasmid Design and Construction.
             A target construct containing a target reporter gene expression cassette flanked
     by zinc finger binding sites (pDAS5380) and an excision construct containing a zinc
 10  finger nuclease gene expression cassette (pDAS5381) were designed and constructed.
     The constructs were designed to be transformed separately into tobacco. Target
     reporter gene excision was carried out by crossing the two tobacco lines, wherein a
     functional zinc finger nuclease recognized the zinc finger binding sites flanking the
    target reporter gene cassette and cleaved the genomic DNA. Crossing the plant lines
 15  containing the target reporter gene construct with the plant line containing the excision
     construct resulted in the removal/deletion of the reporter gene from the plant genome.

             pDAS5380 (FIG. 1) was constructed as a binary plasmid vector. This construct
    contains the following plant transcription unit (PTU) expression cassettes and genetic
20  elements: RB7 MAR ((Matrix Attachment Region (Thompson et al. (1997)

     PTU expression cassette was flanked by CCR5 zinc finger nuclease binding sites. This
     sequence (SEQ ID NO:1) was repeated 4x directly upstream and downstream of the
     GUS PTU expression cassette. The locations of the zinc finger binding sites are
     identified in FIG. 1 as "CCR5 BINDING SITE." These sites are recognized and bound
  5  by the zinc finger nuclease protein encoded by excisor construct, pDAS5381. The
     assembly of this binary vector was completed using standard molecular biology
     techniques. The final plasmid was confirmed via restriction enzyme digestion and

    was confirmed via restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing.
                 Example II: Agrobacterium-Mediated Plant Transformation.
             Transformation of Agrobacterium with pDAS5380 and pDAS5381.
30           Electrocompetent A. tumefaciens (strain LBA4404) cells were obtained from
    Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and transformed using an electroporation method adapted
    from Weigel and Glazebrook (2002) "How to Transform Arabidopsis," in Arabidopsis:

                                                - 27
    A LaboratoryManual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor,
     New York, U.S.A.     Transformed colonies were obtained on yeast extract peptone
     media (YEP) containing spectinomycin (50 pg/mL) and streptomycin (125 gg/mL) and
     confirmed via restriction enzyme digestion. Clones which exhibited the correct
  5  restriction enzyme banding patterns were stored as glycerol stocks at -80'C.
              Agrobacterium-MediatedTransformation of Nicotianatabacum.
              Tobacco (cv. Petit Havana) leaf discs were transformed using A. tumefaciens
     (strain LBA4404) containing pDAS5381 and pDAS5380. Single colonies of
    Agrobacterium containing these plasmids were inoculated into 4 mL of YEP
 10  containing spectinomycin (50 tg/mL) and streptomycin (125 pg/mL) and incubated
     overnight at 28'C on a shaker at 190 rpm. The 4 mL seed culture was subsequently
    used to inoculate a 25 mL culture of YEP media containing spectinomycin (50 ptg/mL)
    and streptomycin (125 tg/ mL) grown in a 125 ml baffled Erlenmeyer flask. This
    culture was incubated at 28'C shaking at 190 rpm until it reached an OD6 00 of ~1.2.
 15 Ten mL of Agrobacterium suspension was placed into sterile 60x20 mm Petri dishes.
              Twenty-five freshly cut leaf discs (0.5 cm 2) cut from plants aseptically grown
    on MS medium (Phytotechnology Labs, Shawnee Mission, KS, #M524) with 30 g/L
    sucrose in PhytaTraysTM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were soaked in 10 mL of overnight
    culture of Agrobacteriumfor a few minutes, blotted dry on sterile filter paper, and then
20  placed onto the same medium with the addition of 1 mg/L indoleacetic acid and 1
    mg/L benzyamino purine. Following 48 hours of co-cultivation, leaf discs
    co-cultivated with Agrobacterium harboring pDAS5380 were transferred to the same
    medium with 5 mg/L Basta* and 250 mg/L cephotaxime. Leaf discs co-cultivated with
    Agrobacterium harboring pDAS538 1 were transferred to the same medium with 10
25  mg/L hygromycin and 250 mg/L cephotaxime. After 3 weeks, individual To plantlets
    were transferred to either MS medium with 10 mg/L Basta* and 250 mg/L
    cephotaxime for pDAS5380, or with 10 mg/L hygromycin and 250 mg/L cephotaxime
    for pDAS5381, an additional 3 weeks prior to transplanting to soil and transfer to the
    greenhouse.

                                               - 28
             Invader* and hydrolysis probe assays were performed to screen samples of
    Basta@-resistant plants to identify those that contained single copy integration of the
    T-DNA in pDAS5380 and pDAS5381. Detailed analysis was conducted using primers
    and probes specific to gene expression cassettes. Single copy events were identified
  5 for additional analysis.
             Tissue samples were collected in 96-well plates and lyophilized for 2 days.
    Tissue maceration was performed with a KlecoTM tissue pulverizer and tungsten beads
    (Visalia, CA). Following tissue maceration, the genomic DNA was isolated in
    high-throughput format using the DNeasy 96 Plant kitTM (Qiagen, Germantown, MD)
10  according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Genomic DNA was quantified by
    Quant-IT Pico Green DNA assay       kitTM (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
    Quantified genomic DNA was adjusted to 9 ng/tL for the Invader* assay or to 5 ng/tL
    for the hydrolysis probe assay using a Biorobot3000TM automated liquid handler
    (Qiagen, Germantown, MD).
15           Custom Invader* assays were developed for PAT gene analysis in tobacco by
    Hologic (Madison, WI). The genomic DNA samples (7.5 tL at 9 ng/tL) were first
    denatured in 96-well plate format by incubation at 95'C for 10 minutes and then cooled
    on ice. Next, 7.5 pL of master mix (3 tL of probe mix for pat and an internal
    reference gene (phenylalanine ammonium lyase (palA); GenBank ID: AB008199), 3.5
20  ptL Cleavase* XI FRET mix, and 1 pL of Cleavase* XI Enzyme/MgCl 2 solution) were
    added to each well and the samples were overlaid with mineral oil. Plates were sealed
    and incubated at 63'C for 1 hour in a BioRad Tetrad* thermocycler. Plates were
    cooled to ambient temperature before being read on a fluorescence plate reader. All
    plates contained 1 copy, 2 copy and 4 copy standards as well as wild-type control
25  samples and blank wells containing no sample. Readings were collected for both FAM
    (k 485-528 nm) and RED (k 560-620 nm) channels, and from these the fold over zero
    (i.e., background) for each channel was determined for each sample by the sample raw
    signal divided by no template raw signal. From this data, a standard curve was
    constructed and the best fit determined by linear regression analysis. Using the
30  parameters identified from this fit, the apparent pat copy number was then estimated
    for each sample.

                                              - 29
            Transgene copy number determination by hydrolysis probe assay, analogous to
   TaqMan* assay, was performed by real-time PCR using the LightCycler*480 system
   (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Assays were designed for HPTII, PAT and
   the internal reference gene phenylalanineammonium lyase (palA) using LightCycler*
 5 Probe Design Software 2.0. For amplification, LightCycler*480 Probes Master mix
   (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) was prepared at 1x final concentration in a
   10 tL volume multiplex reaction containing 0.4 pM of each primer and 0.2 tM of
   each probe (Table 1). A two-step amplification reaction was performed with an
   extension at 58'C for 38 seconds with fluorescence acquisition. All samples were run
10 in triplicate and the averaged Cycle threshold (Ct) values were used for analysis of
   each sample. Analysis of real time PCR data was performed using LightCycler*
   software release 1.5 using the relative quant module and is based on the AACt method.
   For this, a sample of genomic DNA from a single copy calibrator and known 2 copy
   check were included in each run (identical to those used for Invader* assays above).

               Full Length PTU Assay via Southern Blot Analysis.
               Southern blot analysis was used to establish the integration pattern of the
       inserted DNA fragment and identify pDAS5380 and pDAS5381 events which
       contained a full length PTU. Data were generated to demonstrate the integration and
   5  integrity of the transgenes inserted into the tobacco genome. Southern blot data was
      used to identify simple integration of an intact copy of the T-DNA from pDAS5380
      and pDAS5381. Detailed Southern blot analysis was conducted using probes specific
      to gene expression cassettes. The hybridization of these probes with genomic DNA
      that had been digested with specific restriction enzymes identified genomic DNA
 10   fragments of molecular weights, the patterns of which could be analyzed to identify
      events for advancement to TI. These analyses also showed that the plasmid fragment
      had been inserted into tobacco genomic DNA without rearrangements of the PTU.
               Tissue samples were collected in 50 mL conical tubes (Fisher Scientific,
      Pittsburgh, PA) and lyophilized for 2 days. Tissue maceration was performed with a
 15   paint mixer tissue pulverizer and tungsten beads. Following tissue maceration, the
      genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy T M Plant Maxi Kit (Qiagen,
      Germantown, MD) according to manufacturer suggested protocol. Purified genomic
      DNA was precipitated and resuspended in 500 pL TE buffer. The genomic DNA was
      further purified using the Qiagen Genomic TipsTM kit. Genomic DNA was quantified
20   by Quant-IT Pico GreenTM DNA assay kit (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
     CA). Quantified genomic DNA was adjusted to 8 tg in a consistent volume.
               For each sample, 8 gg of genomic DNA was thoroughly digested with the
     restriction enzymes MfeI and NsiJ (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA). Samples
     were incubated at 37'C overnight. The digested DNA was concentrated by
25   precipitation with Quick Precipitation SolutionTM (Edge Biosystems, Gaithersburg,
     MD) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The genomic DNA was then
     resuspended in 25 tL of water at 65'C for 1 hour. Resuspended samples were loaded
     onto a 0.8% agarose gel prepared in lx TAE and electrophoresed overnight at 1.1
     V/cm in lx TAE buffer. The gel was sequentially subjected to denaturation (0.2 M
30   NaOH/0.6 M NaCl) for 30 minutes, and neutralization (0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) / 1.5
     M NaCI) for 30 minutes.

                                               -31
              Transfer of DNA fragments was performed by passively wicking 20x SSC
     solutions overnight through the gel onto treated ImmobilonTM NY+ transfer membrane
     (Millipore, Billerica, MA) by using a chromatography paper wick and paper towels.
     Following transfer, the membrane was briefly washed with 2x SSC, cross-linked with
  5  the StratalinkerTM 1800 (Stratagene, LaJolla, CA), and vacuum baked at 80'C for 3
     hours.
              Blots were incubated with pre-hybridization solution (Perfect Hyb plusTM,
     Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 1 hour at 65'C in glass roller bottles using a model 400
     hybridization incubator (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA). Probes were prepared
 10  from a PCR fragment containing the entire coding sequence. The PCR amplicon was
    purified using QIAEX IITM gel extraction kit and labeled with a 2 P-dCTP via the
    Random RT Prime ITTM labeling kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Blots were hybridized
    overnight at 65'C with denatured probe added directly to hybridization buffer to
    approximately 2 million counts per blot per mL. Following hybridization, blots were
 15 sequentially washed at 65'C with 0.lx SSC/ 0.1% SDS for 40 minutes. Finally, the
    blots were exposed to chemiluminescent film (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN)
    and imaged using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860TM imaging system.
             Expected and observed fragment sizes with a particular digest and probe, based
    on the known restriction enzyme sites of the pDAS5380 or pDAS5381 fragment, are
20  indicated in FIGs. 3 and 4. The Southern blot analyses completed in this study were
    used to identify events that contained full-length intact PTUs from plasmids
    pDAS5380 or pDAS5381 that were inserted into the tobacco genome (FIGs. 3 and 4,
    respectively).
             GUS Expression Assay.
25           To test whether the pDAS5380 transgenic plants contained a functional GUS
    PTU expression cassette, leaf samples were harvested and stained histochemically for
    GUS expression. Leaf discs (-0.25 cm 2) were cut and placed in a 24-well tray (1 leaf
    disc per well) containing 250 ptL of GUS assay solution (Jefferson (1989) Nature
    342:837-8). The 24-well dish was wrapped with Nescofilm* (Fisher Scientific,
30  Pittsburgh, PA) and incubated at 37'C for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the GUS assay
    solution was removed from each well and replaced with 250 pL of 100% ethanol. The
    dish was wrapped with Nescofilm* and incubated at room temperature for 2-3 hours.

                                                 -32
      The ethanol was removed and replaced with fresh ethanol. The leaf discs were then
     viewed under a dissecting microscope. Leaf discs which were stained blue were scored
      as containing a functional GUS PTU expression cassette.
              GFP Expression Assay.
  5           Tobacco leaf samples were analyzed for GFP expression using ELISA. Plates
     were coated with a purified rabbit anti-GFP antibody overnight at 4C. The day of
     analysis, plates were blocked with 0.5% BSA in PBST. Duplicated leaf samples were
     extracted by bead beating frozen leaf pieces with 2 stainless steel beads in a KlecoTM
     tissue grinder for 3 minutes at maximum speed. The samples were centrifuged at 3000
 10  rcf for 10 minutes and the supernatants collected. Extract samples were loaded onto
     ELISA plates at 1:5 and 1:50 dilutions. An E. coli recombinant GFP standard curve
     was run on each plate with concentrations from 12.5 ng/mL to 0.195 ng/mL. The
     standards and samples were incubated on the ELISA plates for 1 hour. Plates were
     washed and a horseradish peroxidase conjugated rabbit anti-GFP antibody was added.
 15  Following 1 hour incubation, the plates were washed and substrate was added. Color
     was allowed to develop before stopping the reaction with H2 SO4 . Absorbance was
     read on a plate reader at 450 nm with a 650 nm reference filter. A quadratic standard
     curve was generated by fitting concentration of the E coli standard against OD.
     Concentrations of unknown samples were determined by linear regression.
20            Selection of To Plants for Target T, Production.
             A total of 68 Basta*-resistant, GUS+/GFP+ plants were regenerated and 38
    plants were found to have 1-2 transgene copies based on PAT Invader* assay.
     Southern analysis identified 14 single-copy events, of which 8 displayed bands
    consistent with intact PAT, GUS and GFP PTUs. Three pDAS5380 events displaying
25  single copy, full length PTU, and expressing GUS and GFP, pDAS5380-3,
    pDAS5380-18 and pDAS5380-46, were self-pollination to produce T seed.
             FokI Expression Assay.
             Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify the mRNA
    expression of the zinc finger nuclease in To tobacco plants transformed with
30  pDAS5381. The assay was developed to quantify the relative Fokl mRNA expression
    from tobacco leaf samples by normalizing these levels against mRNA expression from
    input mRNA. The normalization of the FokI mRNA against total mRNA permits

                                                 -33
     comparison of FokI expression between different samples, and can be used to identify
     events that appear to be highly expressing. The relative ZFN expression is listed in
     Table 1.1.

              Leaf material from To tobacco plants that had been transformed with
     pDAS5381 was collected and placed on ice. Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen's
 10  RNeasy* Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Total mRNA was treated with
     RNase-free DNase per the manufacturer's recommendation to remove any
     contaminating DNA that might amplify during quantitative RT-PCR. First strand
     synthesis was set up according to the Superscript IIITM Reverse Transcriptase Enzyme
     (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) manufacturer's instructions and primed using random
15  hexamers. The synthesized cDNA strands were diluted in water at ratios of 1:10 and
     1:50. Each aliquot was stored at -20'C.
             The qRT-PCR reaction was completed as follows: forward primer
    Fok1_UPL F (SEQ ID NO:12), reverse primer FokUPLR (SEQ ID NO:13), probe
    UPL#130 (cat #04693663001, Roche, Indianapolis, IN), 1x LC480 Probes Master
20  Buffer (Roche Diagnostic, Indianapolis, IN), and 1.5 tL of synthesized cDNA in a 15
      tL reaction. Serial dilutions of the synthesized cDNA were made and assayed in
    repetition. The cocktail was amplified using LightCycler* 480 Probes Master kit
    #04707494001 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). A 96-well microplate was
    demarcated and labeled, 13.5 pL of master mix was added per well. A sealing foil was
25  gently attached to the microplate. The plate was centrifuged for 1 minute at 3,000 rpm

                                                  -34
     in a Qiagen microplate centrifuge. The sealing foil was removed and 1.5 p1L of thawed,
     diluted synthesized cDNA strands were added. A foil seal was firmly affixed to the
     plate and centrifuged as previously described. A PCR program was run as follows: i)
     activate 95'C for 5 minutes; ii) denature 95'C for 10 sec (@ 4.80 C/sec); iii)
  5  anneal/extend 60'C for 25 sec (@ 2.50 C/sec); iv) acquire 72'C for 1 sec (@
     4.8 0 C/sec); steps ii - iv were repeated 45 more times; vi) cool to 38'C for 5 sec.
              A qRT-PCR assay for quantifying the mRNA expression of the internal
     reference gene was completed as another method to normalize the zinc finger nuclease
     mRNA expression. The actin qRT-PCR reaction was completed as follows: forward
 10  primer BY2ACT89S (SEQ ID NO:14), reverse primer BY2ACT89A (SEQ ID
     NO: 15), probe BYACTFQ (SEQ ID NO: 18), 1x LC480 Probes Master Buffer, and 2.0
      tL of synthesized cDNA, in a 10 ptL reaction. Serial dilutions of the synthesized
     cDNA were made and assayed in repetition. In addition, 2 tL of plasmid DNA copy
     number standards were added to separate wells in a dilution series from lowest to
 15  highest concentrations, and these standards were compared to the actin cDNA
     (synthesized from total mRNA) to quantify the copy number. Actin DNA copy
     number standard series were made by cloning the target amplicon into a pCR2.1
     plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and making a dilution series, prepared in dilution
     buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 100 pg/mL yeast tRNA), for quantifying the copy
20   number. The cocktail was amplified using LightCycler* 480 Probes Master kit
    #04707494001 (Roche Diagnostics, USA). A 96-well microplate was demarcated and
     labeled, and 8.0 jtL of master mix was added per well. A sealing foil was gently
    attached to the microplate. The plate was centrifuged for 1 minute at 3,000 rpm in a
    Qiagen microplate centrifuge. The sealing foil was removed, and 2.0 pLL of thawed,
25  diluted synthesized cDNA strands or plasmid DNA were added. A foil seal was firmly
    affixed to the plate and centrifuged as previously described. A PCR program was run
    as follows: i) activate 95'C for 10 minutes; ii) denature 95'C for 10 sec (@ 4.80 C/sec);
    iii) anneal/extend 56'C for 40 sec (@ 2.5 0 C/sec); iv) acquire 72'C for 1 sec (@
    4.8 C/sec); steps ii - iv were repeated 45 more times; vi) cool to 38'C for 5 sec.
30            Selection of T- Plants for Excisor T, Production.
              A total of 54 hygromycin-resistant plants were regenerated, and 34 plants were
    found to have 1-2 transgene copies based on hydrolysis probe assay. Southern analysis

                                                -35
     identified 12 single-copy events of which 7 displayed bands consistent with intact HPT
     and ZFN PTUs. To pDAS5381 events displaying single copy transgene, full length
     PTU, and expressing Fokl, pDAS5381-18, pDAS5381-49 and pDAS5381-56, were
     self-pollination to produce T1 seed.

                       Example III: Generation and Selection of Ti Plants.
              Selfing of To Plants to Produce Homozygous T, Plants.
              The following To plant events: pDAS5380-3; pDAS5380-18; pDAS5380-46;
     pDAS5381-18; pDAS5381-49; and pDAS5381-56 were grown to maturity and
 10  self-fertilized to produce T1 seed. Following germination, T1 plants that were
     homozygous for the pDAS5380 and pDAS5381 constructs were used for transgene
     deletion. According to Mendelian inheritance, crossing the pDAS5381 homozygous
     single copy Ti plants with the pDAS5380 homozygous single copy Ti plants produce
     an F, population containing a heterozygous single copy of both the pDAS5381 and
 15  pDAS5380 constructs. The progeny of this cross was expected to contain one copy of
     the GUS reporter gene. As such, an F1 plant not expressing GUS indicates that the
     GUS PTU expression cassette has been excised.
              To plants were grown under a 16:8-hour photoperiod, with daytime and
    nighttime temperature between 22-24'C. When the primary flowering stem began to
20   elongate and form flower buds, the entire plant was covered with a selfing bag to
    prevent outcrossing. Seeds derived from self-pollination were harvested about eight
    weeks after transplanting. The seed from the self-fertilized plants was collected and
    sewn into soil. The resulting T1 populations were grown in the greenhouse under the
    conditions described above.
25            Molecular Screening of T, Plants.
              Zygosity Assay.
              An assay to quantify the zygosity of the T1 plants was completed using the
    hydrolysis probe method described, supra (Copy Number Assay). The analysis of real
    time PCR data was performed and the number of transgene copies contained in the T,
30  plants was determined by comparison to a copy number control. For this, a sample of
    genomic DNA from the parent To plant which was previously shown to contain a

                                                -36
     single copy calibrator was included. Homozygous pDAS5380 and pDAS5381 Ti
     plants were identified.
              GUS Expression Assay.
              It was important to identify expressing events for advancement to the crossing
  5  experiments. The pDAS5380 Ti plants were assayed using the protocol described,
     supra (GUS Expression Assay). The pDAS5380 plants which were selected as
     homozygous for the pDAS53 80 construct from the zygosity assay, supra,were tested.
     All of the plants stained blue.
              GFP Expression Assay.
 10          The pDAS5380 T, plants were assayed using the protocol described, supra
     (GFP Expression Assay). The pDAS5380 plants which were selected as homozygous
     for the pDAS5380 construct from the zygosity assay, supra, were tested. All of the
     tested plants were positive for GFP expression.
             FokI Expression Assay.
 15          Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify the mRNA
     expression of the zinc finger nuclease in homozygous pDAS53 81 TI tobacco plants
     transformed with pDAS5381. The protocols described, supra (FokI Expression
     Assay), were used for the screening of Ti plants to confirm that the zinc finger nuclease
    was expressing, and to identify the events which would produce robust quantities of
20  zinc finger nuclease for excising the GUS PTU expression cassette.
             Selection of T, Plants.
             Ti pDAS5380 events were screened for zygosity and expression of GUS and
    GFP. Ti pDAS5381 events were screened for zygosity and expression of Fok1. Based
    on these results, T, events were selected for crossing. These events were identified as
25  optimal, as they were homozygous, single copy, full length, transgene-expressing
    events. In addition, sibling-null pDAS5381 plants were retained for use as controls.
    These events do not contain the zinc finger nuclease PTU expression cassette. The
    transgene was not inherited by these Ti plants as a result of transgene segregation. The
    selected events were grown to maturity and crossed to produce F, plants to test
30  transgene excision via the zinc finger nuclease. The crossing strategy is set forth
    below.
             Crossing of the Homozygous T] Plants for Producing an F1 .

                                               -37
              Selected pDAS5380 plants were crossed with select pDAS5381 plants. In
     addition, reciprocal crosses were made so that parents were both male and female
     (Table 2). The plants were crossed by hand; pollen from the anthers of a mature male
     parent was introduced to the stigma of the mature female parent. Plants ready for
  5  crossing were removed from the other plants to reduce the likelihood that unintended
     pollen would fertilize the female tobacco plants. Female plants were emasculated
     (anthers removed prior to dehiscence) using forceps ~15-30 minutes prior to being
     pollinated by the male flower. Flowers were selected for emasculation by observing
    the anthers and the flower color. Newly opened flowers were bright pink around the
 10  edges and the anthers were still closed. Flowers containing anthers which were opened
     or partially opened were not used. Multiple flowers from a stem of the tobacco plant
    were emasculated and fertilized. The additional flowers on the stem (e.g., already
    fertilized pods, old flowers, very young buds, etc.) were removed with forceps to
    ensure that the only pods to form on the branch were from controlled crosses. The
15  branch was labeled with a pollination tag listing the cross made, how many crosses
    were made, and the pollination date. The anthers from the male parent were totally
    removed from the male plant using forceps, and used to fertilize the emasculated
    female. The dehiscing male anthers were rubbed onto the sticky receptive female
    stigma until the stigma was coated with pollen. The stigma was coated several times to
20  reduce the chance of any unintended pollen having access to pollinate the female
    stigma. The seed from the fertilized plants was collected and sewn into soil. The
    resulting F2 progeny plants were grown in the greenhouse under the conditions
    described above.

 5          The F1 plants were tested for GUS expression by histochemically staining leaf
   material. The GUS screen was a preliminary test to identify events which had
   undergone ZFN - mediated transgene deletion. The results of the GUS screen were

                Southern Blot Analysis.
                Southern blot analysis was used to provide molecular characterization of the
       excision of the GUS PTU expression cassette by the zinc finger nuclease. This data
       demonstrated the excision of the GUS PTU expression cassette in a sub-set of events,
   5   the non-excision of the GUS PTU expression cassette in another sub-set of events, and
       a sub-set of chimeric events which contained both excised and non-excised GUS PTU
       expression cassette. Detailed Southern blot analysis was conducted using a probe
       specific to the GFP PTU expression cassette. The hybridization of the probe with
       genomic DNA that had been digested with specific restriction enzymes identified DNA
  10   fragments of specific molecular weights. These patterns could be analyzed to identify
       events that contained an excised GUS PTU expression cassette, contained an intact
       GUS PTU expression cassette, or were chimeric and contained both the excised and
      intact GUS PTU expression cassette.
                A restriction digest was completed for 10 tg of each sample in lx Buffer 4 and
  15   100 Units of NdeI (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) in a final volume of 350 tL
      for a 10-fold over-digestion. Samples were incubated at 37'C overnight. The digested
      DNA was concentrated by re-precipitation with Quick Precipitation SolutionTM (Edge
      Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol.
      Recovered digest was resuspended in 30 pL of lx loading buffer and incubated at 65'C
 20   for 30 minutes. Resuspended samples were loaded onto a 0.8% agarose gel prepared in
      lx TAE (0.8M Tris-acetate [pH 8.0] / 0.04 mM EDTA) and electrophoresed overnight
      at 1.1 V/cm in lx TAE buffer. The gel was sequentially subjected to denaturation (0.2
      M NaOH/0.6 M NaCl) for 30 minutes, and neutralization (0.5 M Tris-HCl [pH 7.5]/1.5
      M NaCl) for 30 minutes. Transfer of DNA fragments was performed by passively
25   wicking 20x SSC solution overnight through the gel onto treated ImmobilonTM NY+
     (Millipore, Billerica, MA) by using a chromatography paper wick and paper towels.
     Following transfer, the membrane was briefly washed with 2x SSC, cross-linked with
     the StratalinkerTM 1800 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and vacuum baked at 80'C for 3
     hours. Blots were incubated with prehybridization solution for 1 hour at 65'C in glass
30   roller bottles using a hybridization incubator. Probe was prepared from PCR fragment
     containing the gfp coding sequence that was purified using a Qiagen gel extraction kit
     and labeled with 50 pCi of a 2 P-dCTP using a labeling kit. Blots were hybridized

                                               - 40
     overnight at 65'C with denatured probe added directly to hybridization buffer to
     approximately 2 million counts per blot per mL. Following hybridization, blots were
     sequentially washed at 65'C with 0.lx SSC/0.1% SDS for 40 minutes. Blots were
     exposed using phosphor imager screen and imaged using a Molecular Dynamics Storm
  5  860TM imaging system. The results of the blots are shown in FIG. 5.
             Plant Transcription Unit PCR Analysis.
             PCR reactions were performed to characterize the excision of the GUS PTU
     expression cassette. Primers were designed which bound to the MAR sequence and the
     ORF 23 3' UTR sequence (the 3' UTR for the GFP PTU expression cassette). This
 10  PCR amplicon spans the GUS PTU expression cassette region which is expected to be
     excised. As such, the use of these PCR primers can detect events in which the GUS
     PTU expression cassette was excised, events in which no excision occurred, and
     chimeric events in which the GUS PTU expression cassette was not uniformly
    removed within the event. Amplification of a 6.7 kb fragment indicates that there is no
15   excision, whereas amplification of a 2.4 kb fragment suggests that the GUS PTU
    expression cassette had been excised. Amplicons containing fragments of both sizes
    indicate that the GUS PTU expression cassette was not completely removed.
             Genomic DNA was isolated from tobacco leaf tissue using the DNeasy TM Plant
    Maxi kit, and quantified using the Quant-ITTM Pico Green DNA assay kit as described,
20  supra. Plant Transcription Unit PCR (PTU PCR) was performed using a Tetrad2TM
    thermocycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Oligonucleotide primers were designed to
    amplify the PTU using VectorNTITM Software. For amplification, Ex Taq
    PolymeraseTM (TaKara, Otsu, Shiga, Japan) was prepared at lx final concentration in a
    25 pL volume singleplex reaction containing 1.2 tM of each primer (SEQ ID NOs: 16
25  and 17), 0.2mM dNTP, 2% DMSO, 1.25 units of TAQ using 4 ng of gDNA template.
    A three-step amplification reaction was performed as follows; 3 minute initial
    denaturation at 94'C and 33 cycles of 30 seconds of 94'C, 6 minutes of 65.5'C, 30
    seconds of 72'C , with a final extension at 72'C for 10 minutes. An aliquot of the PCR
    product was run on a 1%gel with ethidium bromide using a 1Kb+ marker (Invitrogen,
30  Carlsbad, CA) to determine product size. Results of the PTU PCR reactions are shown
    in FIG. 6.

              Sequencing of PTU PCR Products.
              The 2.4 kb bands from the PTU PCR reactions were excised from the gel and
     DNA was purified using the Qiagen Qiaex IITM gel extraction kit (Qiagen,
     Germantown, MD). The purified fragments were ligated into the pCR2.1 TOPO-TATM
  5  cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Presence of a cloned PCR amplicon within
     the pCR2.1 vector was confirmed via restriction enzyme digestion. Clones containing
     the amplified bands were sequenced. The sequences of the junction resulting from the
     removal of the GUS PTU expression cassette are listed in FIGS. 7a and 7b. The entire
     PTU expression cassette was removed. The only sequences remaining are rearranged
 10  zinc finger binding sites which flanked the GUS PTU expression cassette. In addition,
     several PCR amplicons contained deletions which extended into the Actin 2 promoter
     of the GFP PTU expression cassette.
              Restriction Enzyme Analysis of 6.7 kb Band.
              The PCR amplicons of the larger 6.7 kb band were analyzed via restriction
 15  enzyme digestion. These fragments were digested with EcoRI, and with Ncol/SacJ
     restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The sizes of the resulting
    bands were analyzed to confirm that the amplified fragments spanned the non-excised
    pDAS5380 transgene genomic insert.
              Self-fertilization of F Plants to Produce F2 Progenies.
20            A representative group of the Fi plants described above were self-fertilized to
    produce F 2 progenies. Table 5 lists the plants that were selected and their Fi phenotype
    and genotype. Selected Fi plants were grown in a greenhouse under a 16:8-hour
    photoperiod, with daytime and nighttime temperature between 22-24'C. When the
    primary flowering stem began to elongate and form flower buds, the entire plant was
25  covered with a selfing bag to prevent out-crossing. Seeds derived from self-pollination
    were harvested about eight weeks after transplanting. The seed from the self-fertilized
    plants was collected and sewn into soil. The resulting F2 populations were grown in
    the greenhouse under the conditions described above. The F2 plants were analyzed for
    further transgene deletion and heritability of the deletion which had been characterized
30  within Fi plants.

           Analysis of F2 Progenies for Transgene and Heritability of Deletion.
           GUS Analysis.
           The F2 plants were tested for GUS expression by histochemical staining of leaf
 5 material. The plants were assayed using the protocol described, supra (GUS
   Expression Assay). The results are listed in Table 5. The GUS expression data from
   the F2 plants were as expected. The F1 plants that were identified as containing an
   excised GUS PTU expression cassette produced F2 plants that were 100% GUS
   negative, as confirmed by histochemical staining. The absence of the GUS expression
10 within these F2 plants confirms the F1 data, which suggests that the GUS PTU
   expression cassette was excised via zinc finger nuclease-mediated transgene deletion.
   Moreover, this data exemplifies the heritability of the deleted transgene into a
   subsequent generation.
           The sibling-null control plants expressed GUS in about 75% of the F2
15 generation. The remaining plants (about 25%) in which GUS was not detected via
   histochemical staining were expected. The GUS PTU expression cassette is expected
   to segregate within the F2 population at the expected 3:1 ratio. The chimeric events
   which contained both excised and non-excised GUS PTU expression cassettes in the F1
   segregated within the F2 . The majority of the plants expressed GUS.

            Green Flourescent Protein ELISA Analysis.
            Selected F2 plants were tested for GFP expression by ELISA using the protocol
   described, supra (GFP Expression Assay). GFP expression data from the F2 plants
 5 were as expected. The Fi plants expressed GFP in about 75% of the F2 generation.
   The remaining plants (about 25%) in which GFP was not detected via ELISA was
   expected. The GFP PTU expression cassette is expected to segregate within the F2
   population at the expected 3:1 ratio. The chimeric events which contained both excised
   and non-excised GFP PTU expression cassettes in the F1 segregated within the F2 . The
10 majority of the plants expressed GFP.
            PCR, Southern Blot, and GFP Analysis of F2 Progenies.
            Sixteen plants from three of the crosses listed in Table 5 (representing excised,
   intact, and chimeric progenies) were kept for further molecular analysis. These sixteen
   plants consisted of eight plants that were GUS positive and eight plants that were GUS
15 negative for the sibling null control and chimeric plants. The protocols described,
   supra (Southern Blot Analysis; and Plant Transcription Unit PCR Analysis), were
   repeated with genomic DNA from the F2 plants. Selected F2 plants were tested for
   GFP expression by ELISA using the protocol described, supra (GFP Expression

                                               -44
   Assay). The molecular data confirm that plants which did not express GUS do not
   contain the intact GUS PTU expression cassette. GFP expression segregated as
   expected. The results are summarized in FIGs. 8-13.
            While a number of exemplary aspects and embodiments have been discussed
