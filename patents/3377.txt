 TECHNICAL FIELD
         [002] The present disclosure is directed towards an electrochemical cell, and
 more specifically, to an electrochemical cell having a cascade sealing configuration
 and configured for hydrogen reclamation.
 BACKGROUND
         [003] Electrochemical cells, usually classified as fuel cells or electrolysis
 cells, are devices used for generating current from chemical reactions, or inducing a
 chemical reaction using a flow of current. A fuel cell converts the chemical energy of
 a fuel (e.g., hydrogen, natural gas, methanol, gasoline, etc.) and an oxidant (air or
 oxygen) into electricity and waste products of heat and water. A basic fuel cell
 comprises a negatively charged anode, a positively charged cathode, and an ion
 conducting material called an electrolyte.
         [004] Different fuel cell technologies utilize different electrolyte materials. A
 Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell, for example, utilizes a polymeric ion
 conducting membrane as the electrolyte, In a hydrogen PEM fuel cell, hydrogen
 atoms can electrochemically split into electrons and protons (hydrogen ions) at the
 anode. The electrons flow through the circuit to the cathode and generate electricity,
 while the protons diffuse through the electrolyte membrane to the cathode. At the
 cathode, hydrogen protons can react with electrons and oxygen (supplied to the
 cathode) to produce water and heat.
         [0051 An electrolysis cell represents a fuel cell operated in reverse. A basic
 electrolysis cell can function as a hydrogen generator by decomposing water into
 hydrogen and oxygen gases when an external electric potential is applied. The
 basic technology of a hydrogen fuel cell or an electrolysis cell can be applied to
 electrochemical hydrogen manipulation, such as, electrochemical hydrogen
 compression, purification, or expansion.
         [006] An electrochemical hydrogen compressor (EHC), for example, can be
 used to selectively transfer hydrogen from one side of a cell to another, An EHC can
                                            - 1-

WO 2014/134295                                                         PCT/US2014/018996
 comprise a proton exchange membrane sandwiched between a first electrode (i.e.
 an anode) and a second electrode (i.e., a cathode). A gas containing hydrogen can
 contact the first electrode and an electric potential difference can be applied between
the first and second electrodes. At the first electrode, the hydrogen molecules can
 be oxidized and the reaction can produce two electrons and two protons. The two
 protons are electrochemically driven through the membrane to the second electrode
of the cell, where they are rejoined by two rerouted electrons and reduced to form a
hydrogen molecule, The reactions taking place at the first electrode and second
electrode can be expressed as chemical equations, as shown below.
                  First electrode oxidation reaction: H2 --> 2H* + 2e
                 Second electrode reduction reaction: 2H* + 2e- -+ H2
                 Overall electrochemical reaction: H2 -> H2
         [007] EHCs operating in this manner are sometimes referred to as a
hydrogen pumps. When the hydrogen accumulated at the second electrode is
restricted to a confined space, the electrochemical cell compresses the hydrogen or
raises the pressure. The maximum pressure or flow rate an individual cell is capable
of producing can be limited based on the cell design.
         [008] To achieve greater compression or higher pressure, multiple cells can
be linked in series to form a multi-stage EHC. In a multi-stage EHC the gas flow
path, for example, can be configured so the compressed output gas of the first cell
can be the input gas of the second cell. Alternatively, single-stage cells can be
linked in parallel to increase the throughput capacity (i.e., total gas flow rate) of an
EHC. In both a single-stage and multi-stage EHC, the cells can be stacked and
each cell can include a cathode, an electrolyte membrane, and an anode. Each
cathode/membrane/anode assembly constitutes a "membrane electrode assembly",
or "MEA", which is typically supported on both sides by bipolar plates. In addition to
providing mechanical support, the bipolar plates physically separate individual cells
in a stack while electrically connecting them. The bipolar plates also act as current
collectors/conductors, and provide passages for the fuel. Typically, bipolar plates
are made from metals, for example, stainless steel, titanium, etc., and from non
metallic electrical conductors, for example, graphite.
        [009] Electrochemical hydrogen manipulation has emerged as a viable
alternative to the mechanical systems traditionally used for hydrogen management.
Successful commercialization of hydrogen as an energy carrier and the long-term
                                             -2-

WO 2014/134295                                                      PCT/US2014/018996
sustainability of a "hydrogen economy" depends largely on the efficiency and cost
effectiveness of fuel cells, electrolysis cells, and other hydrogen
 manipulation/management systems (i.e., EHCs). Gaseous hydrogen is a convenient
 and common form for energy storage, usually by pressurized containment.
Advantageously, storing hydrogen at high pressure yields high energy density.
         [010] Mechanical compression is a traditional means to achieve
 compression. However, there are disadvantages to mechanical compression. For
example, substantial energy usage, wear and tear on moving parts, excessive noise,
 bulky equipment, and hydrogen embrittlement. Pressurization by thermal cycling is
 an alternative to mechanical compression, but like mechanical compression the
 energy usage is substantial. In contrast, electrochemical compression is quiet,
 scalable, modular, and can achieve high energy efficiency.
         [011] One challenge for electrochemical hydrogen compression is the safety
 concern regarding pressurized hydrogen gas. Hydrogen gas is extremely flammable
 and high pressure hydrogen gas raises safety issues. A major concern can include
 the leaking or unintended release of the high pressure gas from the electrochemical
 compressor. A catastrophic release could pose a safety hazard.
         [012] Moreover, even a small leak that may not rise to the level of a
 significant safety concern nonetheless reduces the efficiency of the electrochemical
 compressor. Therefore, there is a need to prevent or reduce hydrogen leakage.
                                         SUMMARY
         [013] In consideration of the aforementioned circumstances, the present
 disclosure is directed toward an electrochemical cell having a cascade seal
 configuration constructed to limit the unintended release of hydrogen from the cell.
 In addition, the cascade seal configuration can enable the collection and recycling of
 hydrogen leaked from the cell.

 be configured to unseat causing the second fluid to leak past the second seal into
 the low pressure zone when the closing force further approaches the opening force
 causing a second separation of the pair of bipolar plates.

  adjusting the closing force applied to the electrochemical cell based on the
  monitored pressure, wherein adjusting the closing force changes the pressure at

                         DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS
         [039] Reference will now be made in detail to the present exemplary
 embodiments of the present disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the
 accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be
 used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. Although described
 in relation to an electrochemical cell employing hydrogen, it is understood that the
 devices and methods of the present disclosure can be employed with various types
 of fuel cells and electrochemical cells, including, but not limited to electrolysis cells,
 hydrogen purifiers, hydrogen expanders, and hydrogen compressors.
         [040]    FIG. 1 shows an exploded side view of an electrochemical cell 100,
 according to an exemplary embodiment. Electrochemical cell 100 can comprise an
 anode 110, a cathode 120, and a proton exchange membrane (PEM) 130 disposed
 in between anode 110 and cathode 120. Anode 110, cathode 120, and PEM 130
 combined can comprise a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) 140. PEM 130 can
 comprise a pure polymer membrane or composite membrane where other material,
 for example, silica, heteropolyacids, layered metal phosphates, phosphates, and
 zirconium phosphates can be embedded in a polymer matrix. PEM 130 can be
  permeable to protons while not conducting electrons, Anode 110 and cathode 120
 can comprise porous carbon electrodes containing a catalyst layer. The catalyst
  material, for example platinum, can increase the reaction of fuel.
          [041] Electrochemical cell 100 can further comprise two bipolar plates 150,
  160. Bipolar plates 150, 160 can act as support plates, conductors, provide
  passages to the respective electrode surfaces for the fuel, and provide passages for
 the removal of the compressed fuel. Bipolar plates 150, 160 can also include access
  channels for cooling fluid (i.e., water, glycol, or water glycol mixture). The bipolar
  plates can be made from aluminum, steel, stainless steel, titanium, copper, Ni-Cr
                                              -8-

WO 2014/134295                                                        PCT/US2014/018996
 alloy, graphite or any other electrically conductive material. Bipolar plates 150, 160
 can separate electrochemical cell 100 from the neighboring cells in an
 electrochemical stack (not shown). For example, multiple electrochemical cells 100
 can be linked in series to form a multi-stage electrochemical hydrogen compressor
 (EHC) or stacked in parallel to form a single-stage EHC.
         [042] In operation, according to an exemplary embodiment, hydrogen gas
 can be supplied to anode 110 through bipolar plate 150. An electric potential can be
 applied between anode 110 and cathode 120, wherein the potential at anode 110 is
 greater than the potential at cathode 120. The hydrogen at anode 110 can be
 oxidized causing the hydrogen to split into electrons and protons. The protons are
 electrochemically transported or "pumped" through PEM 130 while the electrons are
 rerouted around PEM 130. At cathode 120 on the opposite side of PEM 130 the
 transported protons and rerouted electrons are reduced to form hydrogen. As more
 and more hydrogen is formed at cathode 120 the hydrogen can be compressed and
 pressurized within a confined space.
         [043] Within electrochemical cell 100, a plurality of different pressure zones
 and a plurality of seals can define one or more different pressure zones. FIG. 2A
 shows the plurality of different seals and pressure zones within electrochemical cell
 100. As shown in FIG. 2A, the plurality of seals can include a first seal 171, a
 second seal 181, and a third seal 191. First seal 171 can be contained entirely
 within second seal 181 and second seal 181 can be contained entirely within third
 seal 191. In addition, the plurality of seals can further include ancillary first seals
 175, 176. Ancillary seal 175 and 176 can be located outside first seal 171, but within
 second seal 181.
         [044] First seal 171 can define high pressure zone 170 and be configured to
 contain a first fluid 172 (e.g., hydrogen) within high pressure zone 170. First seal
 171 can delimit the outer boundaries of high pressure zone 170. High pressure zone
 170 can correspond to the high pressure cathode 120 side of PEM 130. Hydrogen
 formed at cathode 130 can be collected in high pressure zone 170 and contained by
 first seal 171. Hydrogen within high pressure zone 170 can be compressed and, as
 a result, increase in pressure as more and more hydrogen is formed in high pressure
 zone 170. Hydrogen in high pressure zone 170 can be compressed to a pressure
 great than 15,000 psi.

WO 2014/134295                                                        PCT/US2014/018996
         [045] Ancillary first seals 175, 176 can define two ancillary high pressure
 zones 177, 178 that can be in fluid communication with high pressure zone 170.
 Ancillary high pressure zones 177, 178 can be common passages configured to
 discharge the first fluid 172 from high pressure zone 170. Ancillary high pressure
 zones 177, 178 can be in fluid communication with common passages of adjacent
 electrochemical cell in a multi-cell electrochemical compressor.
         [046] Second seal 181 can define intermediate pressure zone 180 and be
 configured to contain a second fluid 182 within intermediate pressure zone 180.
 Second seal 181 can delimit the outer boundaries of intermediate pressure zone
 180. Intermediate pressure zone 180 can correspond to the low pressure anode 110
 side of PEM 130. Second fluid 182 (e.g., hydrogen or gas mixture containing
 hydrogen) supplied to anode 110 can be contained in intermediate pressure zone
 180 by second seal 181 until it is oxidized and "pumped" across PEM 130 to cathode
 120 and high pressure zone 170. Second fluid 182 within intermediate pressure
 zone 180 can vary based on the pressure being supplied. Regardless, second fluid
 182 in intermediate pressure zone 180 can generally be lower pressure than first
 fluid 172 in high pressure zone 170.
         [047] Third seal 191 can define low pressure zone 190 and be configured to
 contain a third fluid 192 within low pressure zone 190. Third seal 191 can delimit the
 outer boundaries of low pressure zone 190. Low pressure zone 190 can comprise
 coolant fluid passages and third fluid 192 can comprise coolant fluid. Coolant fluid
 can include water, glycol, or combination thereof. In a high temperature system oil
 can be used as a coolant fluid. Third fluid 192 can generally be maintained at a
 pressure less than the pressure of second fluid 182 in intermediate pressure zone
  180 and first fluid 172 in high pressure zone 170. Low pressure zone 190 can
 include an inlet passage and outlet passage (not shown) configured so third fluid 192
 can be circulated through low pressure zone 190.
          [048] In an alternate embodiment as shown in FIG. 2B, low pressure zone
  190 can be located not within electrochemical cell 100, but rather in the area
 surrounding electrochemical cell 100 or a plurality of cells forming a stack. For
 example, low pressure zone 190 can contain nitrogen 192 forming a nitrogen blanket
 surrounding electrochemical cell 100 or in other embodiments surrounding a stack of
  cells.

WO 2014/134295                                                       PCT/US2014/018996
          [049] FIG. 3A shows a cross-sectional view of electrochemical cell 100 along
 plane A of FIG. 2A. As described in FIG. 2A, electrochemical cell 100 can comprise
 MEA 140 and bipolar plates 150, 160. Between bipolar plates 150, 160 can be first
 seal 171 defining high pressure zone 170, second seal 181 defining intermediate
 pressure zone 180, and third seal 191 defining low pressure zone 190. In FIG. 3A,
 first seal 171, second seal 181, and third seal 191 can each be shown as two
 separate cross-sections of a single continuous seal as previously shown in FIG. 2A.
          [050 As shown in FIG. 3A, first seal 171 can be positioned against a first
 shoulder 173. First shoulder 173 can be configured to maintain the position of first
 seal 171 as pressure can build within high pressure zone 170. Pressure within high
 pressure zone 170 can apply an outward force against first seal 171. The height of
 first shoulder 173 can range from about 98% to about 25% of the uncompressed
 thickness of first seal 171.
          [051] In the particular embodiment shown in FIG. 3A there is no shoulder
 located interior to first seal 171. The absence of an interior shoulder as shown in
 FIG. 3A can allow for first seal 171 to be combined, joined, connected, or integral to
 MEA 140 or portion thereof. Having first seal 171 integral to MEA 140 can facilitate
 consistent, efficient and streamlined assembly of electrochemical cell 100. However,
 in alternate embodiments an additional shoulder can be positioned interior to first
 seal 171 that can be configured to create a groove in which first seal 171 can be
  positioned.
           [052] Referring again to FIG. 3A, second seal 181 can be positioned in a
  second groove 183 formed between two shoulders in bipolar plate 160. To the
  interior of second groove 183 and second seal 181 can be intermediate pressure
  zone 180 and to the exterior of second groove 183 and second seal 181 can be low
  pressure zone 190. The depth of second groove 183 can range from about 98% to
  about 25% of the uncompressed thickness of second seal 181.
           [053] Third seal 191 as shown in FIG. 3A, can be positioned in a third groove
  193 formed between two shoulders in bipolar plate 160. To the interior of third
  groove 193 and third seal 191 can be low pressure zone 190 and to the exterior third
  groove 193 and third seal 191 can be the surrounding environment of
  electrochemical cell 100. The depth of third groove 193 can range from about 98%
  to about 25% of the uncompressed thickness of third seal 191.

WO 2014/134295                                                         PCT/US2014/018996
         [054] During assembly first seal 171, second seal 181, and third seal 191
 between bipolar plate 150, 160 can be compressed by a predetermined percentage
 of their uncompressed thickness by selecting the appropriate height of their
 respective shoulders 173 or depth of their respective grooves, 183 and 193. First
 shoulder 173 and the shoulders forming second groove 183 and third groove 193
 can act as a stop, as shown in FIG. 3A, for bipolar plate 150. By acting as a stop the
 possibility of over compressing the seals can be reduced. The elevation of first
 shoulder 173 and the shoulders forming second groove 183 and third groove 193
 can be equal, such that, bipolar plate 150 can make contact with all the shoulder
 surfaces of bipolar plate 160 at once when the surfaces are parallel.
         [055] In alternate embodiments (not shown), second groove 183 and third
 groove 193 can be formed in bipolar plate 150 rather than bipolar plate 160, In
 another embodiment, second groove 183 can be formed in either bipolar plate 150,
 160 while third groove 193 is formed in the other plate. In yet another embodiment,
 portions of second groove 183 and third groove 193 can be formed in both bipolar
 plates 150, 160.
         [056] Second groove 183 and third groove 193 can have a cross-sectional
 geometry that corresponds to the shape of second seal 181 and third seal 191. For
 example, the geometry of the seal and groove cross-section can be a square,
 rectangle, triangle, polygon, circle, or oval. In various embodiments the width of
 second seal 181 and third seal 191 can be less than the corresponding groove. The
 additional space in the grooves can allow for the expanding and contracting of the
 seals caused by temperature change, pressure change from the internal gases, and
 pressure change from the bipolar plate compression. As shown in FIG. 3A, typically
 the seals can be forced outwardly to the outer most position within the grooves
 because the seals experience higher pressure from the interior side versus the
 exterior side.
         [057] In other embodiments, the depth of the grooves (e.g., second groove
 183 and third groove 193) can be reduced to zero or eliminated and first seal 171,
 second seal 181, and third seal 191 can be formed of flat gasket material that can be
 cut in an enlarging pattern configured to maintain the cascade configuration. For
 example, first fluid leaked past first seal 171 can be collected in intermediate
 pressure zone 180.
                                             - 12-

WO 2014/134295                                                         PCT/US2014/018996
         [058] First seal 171, second seal 181, and third seal 191 can be a gasket, 0
 ring, or other sealing component. First seal 171, second seal 181, and third seal 191
 can be made of an elastomeric or polymeric sealing material, for example, silicone,
 EPDM (ethylenepropylene-diene-monomer), fluoroelastomer, nitrile rubber (Buna-N),
 PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), polysulfone, polyetherimide, polychenylene sulfide,
 PEEK (polyether ether ketone), polyimide , PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PEN
 (polyethylene naphthalate), HDPE (high-density polyethylene), polyurethane,
 neoprene, acetal, nylon, polybutylene terephthalate, NBR (acrylonitrile-butadiene
 rubber), etc. The material of each seal can be different than the material of the
 other seals, the material can be the same for just two of the seals, or the material
 can be the same for all the seals.
         [059] Like the material, the thickness of each seal can be different than the
 other seals. Thickness can be measured along a vertical axis (Y) of electrochemical
 cell 100. As shown in FIG. 3A, the thickness of second seal 181 is greater than the
 thickness of first seal 171 and the thickness of third seal 191 is greater than the
 thickness of second seal 181. Consequently, the outermost seal, third seal 191, can
 have the greatest thickness and the innermost seal, first seal 171, can have the
 smallest thickness. For example, the thickness of first seal 171 can range between
 about 0.01 mm and about 1.0 mm, the thickness of second seal 181 can range
 between about 0.02 mm and about 2.0 mm, and the thickness of third seal 191 can
 range between about 0.03 mm and 3.0 mm.
         [060] For embodiments where the cross-sectional geometry of first seal 171,
 second seal 181, and third seal 191 can be a circle or oval, the thickness as
 described above can refer to the diameter of the circle or oval cross-section.
          [061] As shown in FIG. 3B, during operation of electrochemical cell 100, the
  pressure of first fluid 172, second fluid 182, and third fluid 192 applied within each
  corresponding zone between bipolar plates 150, 160 can produce an opening force
 200. Opening force 200 unopposed can cause bipolar plate 150, 160 to separate.
  In order to prevent opening force 200 from separating bipolar plates 150, 160, a
  closing force 210 can be applied to the plates to oppose and overcome opening
 force 200. It is understood that the pressure of first fluid 172, second fluid 182, and
 third fluid 192 would produce more forces than those represented by the plurality of
  arrows representing opening force 200. For example, lateral forces (not shown)
                                             - 13-

WO 2014/134295                                                           PCT/US2014/018996
 perpendicular to opening force 200 would be produced as well as other forces
 pointing outwardly from each pressure zone in all possible directions.
          [062] FIG. 4A shows a cross-section of electrochemical cell 100 in a first
 configuration. Electrochemical cell 100 can maintain first configuration when closing
 force 210 is sufficient to overcome opening force 200 and hold bipolar plates 150,
 160 substantially together. While in first configuration first seal 171, second seal
 181, and third seal 191 can all maintain contact with both the top and bottom sealing
 surfaces of bipolar plate 150, 160, preventing leaking or bypassing of first fluid 172,
 second fluid 182, or third fluid 192. In this particular situation, all seals are fulfilling
 their function.
          [063] When electrochemical cell 100 is in first configuration, as described
 above, the actual measurement of the separation between the surfaces of bipolar
 plates 150, 160 can vary. For example, the separation can range from about 0.00
 mm to about 0,01 mm, to about 0.05 mm, to about 0.10 mm.
          [064] FIG. 4B shows a cross-section of electrochemical cell 100 in a second
 configuration. Electrochemical cell 100 can change to second configuration when
 closing force 210 is reduced or opening force 200 is increased (e.g., first fluid 172
 pressure increases) causing bipolar plates 150, 160 to separate. As shown in FIG.
 4B, the first separation of bipolar plates 150, 160 can cause first seal 171 to unseat
 allowing the bypass of first fluid 172 from high pressure zone 170 into intermediate
 pressure zone 180. In the particular embodiment shown in FIG. 46, first seal 171 is
 shown to unseat from bipolar plate 160 first, allowing the flow of first fluid 172 under
 and around first seal 171. However, it is understood that in alternate embodiments
 (not shown), first seal 171 can unseat from bipolar plate 150 first, allowing the flow of
 first fluid 172 over first seal 171 by passing between first seal 171 and MEA 140.
           [065] The flow of first fluid 172 from high pressure zone 170 to intermediate
 pressure zone 180 can be caused by the pressure differential between first fluid 172
 and second fluid 182 and may travel along the path of least resistance. First seal
  171 can be configured to be the first of the seals to unseat by having a thickness
  less than second seal 181 and third seal 191. This can allow third seal 191 and
 second seal 181 to maintain contact with both sealing surfaces preventing fluid from
  bypassing either seal despite the first separation of bipolar plates 150, 160 present in
 second configuration.

         [066] When electrochemical cell 100 is in second configuration, as described
 above, the actual measurement of the first separation that exists between bipolar
 plates 150, 160 can vary. For example, first separation can range from about 0.01
 mm to about 0.05 mm, to about 0.10 mm, to about 0.25 mm.
         [067] FIG. 4C shows a cross-section of electrochemical cell 100 in a third
 configuration. Electrochemical cell 100 can change to third configuration when
 closing force 210 is further reduced or opening force 200 is further increased causing
 bipolar plates 150, 160 to undergo second separation. As shown in FIG. 4C, second
 separation of bipolar plates 150, 160 can cause both first seal 171 and second seal
 181 to unseat allowing the bypass of first fluid 172 from high pressure zone 170 and
 second fluid 182 from intermediate pressure zone 180 into low pressure zone 190.
 In the particular embodiment shown in FIG. 4C, second seal 181 is shown to unseat
 from bipolar plate 150 first, allowing the flow of second fluid 182 over second seal
 181. However, it is understood that in alternate embodiments (not shown), second
 seal 181 can unseat from bipolar plate 160 first, allowing the flow of second fluid 182
 under and around second seal 181.
         [068] The flow of second fluid 182 from intermediate pressure zone 180 to
 low pressure zone 190 can be caused by the pressure differential between second
 fluid 182 and third fluid 192. Second seal 181 can be configured to be the second
 seal to unseat by being thicker than first seal 171, but not as thick as third seal 191.
 Therefore, because third seal 191 can be thicker than both first seal 171 and second
 seal 181, third seal 191 can maintain contact with both sealing surfaces preventing
 flow from bypassing notwithstanding the second separation of bipolar plates 150,
 160.
         [069] When electrochemical cell 100 is in third configuration, as described
 above, the actual measurement of the second separation can vary. For example,
 second separation can range from about 0.05 mm to about 0,25 mm, to about 0. 50
 mm.
         [070] Electrochemical cell 100 can be configured to transition from first
 configuration to second configuration and second configuration to third configuration
 based on the changing magnitude of closing force 210 and opening force 200 during
 operation. In addition, electrochemical cell 100 can also transition from third
 configuration to second configuration and second configuration to first configuration
 based on the changing magnitude of closing force 210 and opening force 200. It is
                                            - 15-

WO 2014/134295                                                        PCT/US2014/018996
 contemplated that transitioning between first configuration, second configuration, and
 third configuration can occur continuously during the operation in response to the
 changing magnitude of closing force 210 and opening force 200.
         [071] In other embodiments, it is contemplated that the modulus of elasticity
 of the seals can be different instead of the thickness of the seals to enable the
 dispersed unseating of the seals, In yet another embodiment, both the thickness
 and the modulus of elasticity can be varied.
         [072] The arrangement of the seals as described above can be classified as
 a cascade seal configuration. The cascade seal configuration can provide several
 advantages. For example, the cascade seal configuration can limit the potential of
 high pressure hydrogen escaping electrochemical cell 100 by providing seal
 redundancy in the form of three levels of sealing protection. Reducing the potential
 of hydrogen leaks can benefit safety and energy efficiency.
         [073] In addition, the cascade seal configuration can also allow for self
 regulation of pressure. Self-regulation of pressure can be achieved because of the
 disparity in seal thickness and the resulting dispersed unseating of first seal 171,
 second seal 181, and third seal 191. For example, when electrochemical cell 100 is
 in second configuration as shown in FIG. 4B, first seal 171 can unseat allowing first
 fluid 172 to leak into intermediate pressure zone 180. First fluid 172 leaking into
 intermediate pressure zone 180 can bleed pressure from high pressure zone 170.
 By bleeding pressure from high pressure zone 170, opening force 200 can be
 reduced. The drop in opening force 200 can allow the first separation of bipolar
 plates 150, 160 to be reversed causing the transition of electrochemical cell 100 from
 second configuration to first configuration and the reseating of first seal 171.
         [074] First fluid 172 that leaks by first seal 171 can combine with second fluid
  182 and be utilized by electrochemical cell 100, in effect, the leaked first fluid 172
 can be recycled. A consequence of this leaking and subsequent recycling can be a
 loss in compression efficiency because the leaked hydrogen is "pumped" through
  PEM 130 twice. However, the potential loss in compression efficiency is still less
 than the overall loss in efficiency would be if the leaked hydrogen was not recovered
 an instead leaked to the exterior of electrochemical cell 100 and was lost.
          [075] In the event the bleeding of pressure from high pressure zone 170 is
  not enough to cause the transition from second configuration to first configuration,
 second separation may occur causing electrochemical cell to transition from second
                                            - 16-

WO 2014/134295                                                         PCT/US2014/018996
 configuration to third configuration. In third configuration as shown in FIG. 4C, the
 second separation of bipolar plates 150, 160 can cause second seal 181 to unseat
 allowing second fluid 182 to leak into low pressure zone 190. Second fluid 182
 leaking into low pressure zone 190 can bleed pressure from intermediate pressure
 zone 180. By bleeding pressure from intermediate pressure zone 180, opening force
 200 can be further reduced. The drop in opening force 200 can allow the second
 separation of bipolar plates 150, 160 to be reversed causing the transition of
 electrochemical cell 100 from third configuration to second configuration and the
 reseating of at least second seal 181.
          [076] The consequence of bleeding second fluid 182 from intermediate
 pressure zone 180 to low pressure zone 190 can be a loss of cell efficiency.
 However, a benefit can be reducing the possibility of second fluid 182 (i.e., hydrogen
 gas) from escaping electrochemical cell 100.
          [0771 In various embodiments, the pressure of third fluid 192 in low pressure
 zone 190 can be monitored. The unseating of second seal 181 can result in a
 pressure increase in low pressure zone 190 caused by the bleeding of second fluid
 182 pressure into low pressure zone 190. Therefore, by monitoring the pressure of
 third fluid 192 the unseating of second seal 181 and the leaking for second fluid 182
 can be detected. In addition, electrochemical cell 100 can be configured to shut
 down before the pressure in low pressure zone 190 reaches a critical pressure. The
 critical pressure can be set just below the pressure at which third seal 191 would
 unseat allowing first fluid 172, second fluid 182, and third fluid 192 to escape
 electrochemical cell 100. In another embodiment, the composition of third fluid 192
 can be monitored to detect the presence of a foreign fluid (e.g., first fluid 172 or
 second fluid 182). A detection sensor (e.g., hydrogen sensor) can be used to detect
the presence of foreign fluid in low pressure zone 190.
          [078] Monitoring the pressure can be accomplished in a variety of means,
 For example, a pressure transmitter could be configured to read the pressure in low
 pressure zone 190 and when the pressure reaches the critical pressure set point the
electrical potential to anode 110 and cathode 120 could be turned off preventing
further hydrogen from getting "pumped" across PEM 130.
          [079] In other embodiments, the pressure of second fluid 182 in intermediate
 pressure zone 180 and first fluid 192 in high pressure zone 190 can also be
 monitored. For example, monitoring the pressure of second fluid 182 can allow the
                                            - 17-

 cell to be shut down before the pressure reaches the point where second seal 181
 could unseat.
         [080] In various embodiments, when first fluid 172 or second fluid 182 (e.g.,
 high or low pressure hydrogen) bleeds into low pressure zone 190 it can combine
 with third fluid 192 (e.g,, coolant fluid) and can be carried out of low pressure zone
 190 by the circulating third fluid 192.
         [081] FIG. 5 shows an electrochemical hydrogen reclamation system (EHRS)
 500, according to an exemplary embodiment. EHRS 500 can comprise an
 electrochemical cell 100 as described above having a cascade seal configuration. In
 addition to electrochemical cell 100, EHRS 500 can comprise a hydrogen
 reclamation apparatus 510. Apparatus 510 can be in fluid communication with low
 pressure zone 190 and intermediate pressure zone 180 of electrochemical cell 100.
 Apparatus 510 can receive third fluid 192 discharged from low pressure zone 190
 and can be configured to recover at least a portion of any second fluid 182 contained
 in third fluid 192. After third fluid 192 passes through hydrogen reclamation
 apparatus 510, third fluid can be resupplied to low pressure zone 190. Any second
 fluid 182 recovered from third fluid 192 by hydrogen reclamation apparatus 510 can
 be reintroduced into intermediate pressure zone 180 by way of a recycle line 520
 configured to fluidly connect hydrogen reclamation apparatus 510 and intermediate
 pressure zone 180. Recycling second fluid 182 can improve overall system
 efficiency. When second fluid 182 is hydrogen gas, for example, recycling second
 fluid 182 reduces the amount of new hydrogen required.
          [082] Hydrogen reclamation apparatus 510 can use a variety of technologies
 to separate second fluid 182 from third fluid 192. For example, dissolved gas
 separation from liquid coolant or hydrogen separation membrane from a nitrogen
 blanket.
          [083] In various embodiments, EHRS 500 can be configured to monitor the
 pressure of third fluid 192 in low pressure zone 190. By monitoring the pressure of
 third fluid 192 in low pressure zone 190, hydrogen reclamation apparatus 510 can be
 configured to only be engaged or energized when an increased pressure has been
 detected, which can indicate second seal 182 has unseated and second fluid has
 leaked into low pressure zone 190. By limiting the use of hydrogen reclamation
 apparatus the overall system efficiency can be increased.

         [084] In other embodiments, when first fluid 172 or second fluid 182 (e.g.,
 high or low pressure hydrogen) bleeds into low pressure zone 190 and combines
 with third fluid 192 (e.g., coolant fluid), it can be circulated with third fluid 192 and
 remain circulating until third fluid 192 is discharged rather than be recovered or
 reclaimed from third fluid 192.
         [085] Electrochemical cell 100 can operate at differential pressures higher
 than about 15,000 psi. For example, a differential pressure can be measured as the
 difference between second fluid 182 pressure (i.e., the inlet hydrogen pressure)
 which can range from about -10 psi to about 0 psi, or from about 0 psi to about 25
 psi, about 100 psi, about 500 psi, about 1,000 psi, or about 6,000 psi and first fluid
 172 pressure (i.e., compressed hydrogen pressure) which can range from the lower
 bound of the inlet hydrogen pressure to higher than about 15,000 psi. The
 differential pressure as described above can be the differential pressure experienced
 by first seal 171. Second seal 181 can experience differential pressure between
 second fluid 182 and third fluid 192 ranging between about 0 psi to about 25 psi,
 about 100 psi, about 500 psi, about 1,000 psi, or about 6,000 psi.
          [086] The cascade seal configuration describe above can enable closing
 force 210 to be tuned (i.e., increased or decreased) to a particular opening force
 200. Traditionally closing force 210 can be set to deliver a preload on first seal 171,
 second seal 181, and third seal 191 sufficient to withstand the expected opening
 force 200 caused by the internal pressure. However, by changing the preload or
 adjusting closing force 210 during operation of electrochemical cell 100, the pressure
 at which first seal 171, second seal 181, and third seal 191 unseat can be tuned so
 they each unseat and leak at a preferred particular pressure.
          [087] The tuning capability of electrochemical cell 100 can be used to
 enhance the safety of the device. As described above, unseating of the seals
 enables the bleeding of high pressure and the reseating of the seals. Therefore, by
 tuning closing force 210, electrochemical cell can be configured so that the seals are
 the first component to react to a pressure increase instead of another component
 that's failure could result in release of hydrogen.
          [088] FIG. 6 shows a flow chart 600, for a method of tuning the seals of
 electrochemical cell 100. The method can include providing electrochemical cell
  100, which can have a plurality of seals in a cascade seal configuration as described
 above. Next, the method can include applying an initial closing force to the
                                                - 19 -

 electrochemical cell based on the expected operating pressure. After applying an
 initial closing force the cell can be energized and operation can begin. During
 operation the pressure of the low, intermediate, and high pressure zones within
 electrochemical cell 100 can be monitored continuously or intermittently. Based on
 the monitored pressures and the resulting opening force the closing force can be
 adjusted. Adjusting the closing force can change the pressure at which at least one
 of the plurality of seals unseats. This process can continue throughout the operation
 of the electrochemical cell or can be configured to run for only a finite period of time
 initially at startup. As required, operation of electrochemical cell can be ended.
          1089] More or fewer seals and pressure zones are contemplated. For
 example, in another embodiment as shown in FIG. 7, electrochemical cell 100 can
 comprise a first seal 171 and second seal 181. Accordingly, electrochemical cell 100
 as shown in FIG. 7 can comprise a first seal 171 defining a high pressure zone 170.
 First seal 171 can be located between the bipolar plates 150, 160 and configured to
 contain a first fluid 172 with high pressure zone 170. Electrochemical cell 100 can
 further comprise a second seal 181 defining an intermediate pressure zone 180.
 Second seal 182 can be located between bipolar plates 150, 160 and configured to
 contain second fluid 182 within intermediate pressure zone 180. First seal 171 can
 be contained entirely with second seal 181. Electrochemical cell 100 can further
 comprise ancillary first seals 175, 176. Ancillary seal 175 and 176 can be located
 outside first seal 171, but within second seal 181.
          [090] In addition, with regard to electrochemical cell 100, first fluid 172 can
 be at a higher pressure than second fluid 182. First seal 171 and second seal 181
 can have a generally rectangular cross-section. The thickness of second seal 181
 can be greater than first seal 171. First seal 171 can be configured to leak first fluid
 172 into intermediate pressure zone 180 when first seal 171 unseats. In such an
 embodiment, electrochemical cell 100 can be configured to shutdown prior to the
 unseating of second seal 181 reducing the possibility of second fluid 182 leaking
 from intermediate pressure zone 180.
          [091] First seal 171 and second seal 181 within electrochemical cell 100 can
 be configured to remain seated preventing the leaking of first fluid 172 and second
 fluid 182 when a closing force being applied to bipolar plates 150, 160 is greater than
 the opening force within bipolar plates 150, 160. When closing force applied to
 bipolar plates 150, 160 approaches the opening force within bipolar plates 150, 160,

 first seal 171 can be configured to unseat before second seal 181 unseats causing
 first fluid 172 to leak past first seal 171 into intermediate pressure zone 180. First
 fluid 172 that leaks past first seal 171 can combine with second fluid 182 and be
 recycled,
           [092] In other embodiments, a cascade seal configuration similar to the
 description above can be utilized with a two-piece bipolar plate. For example,
 bipolar plate 150 and 160, according to some embodiments, can each be formed of
 two pieces. A two-piece bipolar plate can be advantageous for various reasons. For
 example, reduced manufacturing cost, flexibility in manufacturing, reduced material
 cost, increased serviceability, and improved material selection capability (e.g.,
 electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance). In other embodiments, bipolar plate
 150 and 160 can be confirmed from a plurality of pieces.
           [093] A cascade seal configuration between the two pieces of the bipolar
 plate can be configured for capture, recovery, or reclamation of fluid (e.g., hydrogen)
 leaked between the two-pieces, as described further below. Otherwise, the fluid
 leaked from the electrochemical cell or stack could create a potential safety issue. In
 addition, a volume of fluid could build up between the two pieces of the bipolar plate
 if the fluid is unable to vent. The trapped high pressure fluid can cause damage to
 the bipolar plate and potentially cause further leaking.
           [094] FIG. 8 shows one embodiment of bipolar plates 150 and 160
 comprising a two-piece bipolar plate 800 comprising a first component 801 and a
 second component 802 configured for a cascade seal configuration. First
 component 801 can form a void 803 in fluid communication with a flow structure 805.
           [095] Electrochemical cell 100, as shown in FIG. 1, can further comprise
 electrically-conductive gas diffusion layers (GDLs) (not shown) within
 electrochemical cell 100 on each side of MEA 140. GDLs can serve as diffusion
 media enabling the transport of gases and liquids within the cell, provide electrical
 conduction between bipolar plates 150 and 160 and PEM 130, aid in the removal of
 heat and process water from the cell, and in some cases, provide mechanical
 support to PEM 140. In addition, channels (not shown), known as flow fields, in
 bipolar plates 150 and 160 can be configured to supply gases to anode 110 and
 cathode 120 of MEA 140. Reactant gases on each side of PEM 130 can flow
 through flow fields and diffuse through the porous GDLs. The flow fields and the
                                              - 21 -

 GDLs can be positioned contiguously and coupled by the internal fluid streams.
 Accordingly, the flow field and the GDL can collectively form flow structure 805.
         [096] First component 801 and second component 802 can be generally flat
 and have a generally rectangular profile. In other embodiments, components 801
 and 802 can have a profile shaped like a square, a "race-track" (i.e., a substantially
 rectangular shape with semi-elliptical later sides), circle, oval, elliptical, or other
 shape. The shape of first component 801 and second component 802 can
 correspond to the other components of electrochemical cell 100 (e.g., cathode,
 anode, PEM, flow structure, etc.) or electrochemical cell stack.
         [097] First component 801 and second component 802 can each be formed
 of one or more materials. First component 801 and second component 802 can be
 formed of the same materials or different materials. Component 801 and 802 can be
 formed of a metal, such as, stainless steel, titanium, aluminum, nickel, iron, etc., or a
 metal alloy, such as, nickel chrome alloy, nickel-tin alloy, or a combination there of.
         [098] First component 801 and second component 802 can comprise a clad
 material, for example, aluminum clad with stainless steel on one or more regions.
 Cladding can provide the advantages of both metals, for example, in the case of a
 bipolar plate fabricated from stainless steel-clad aluminum, the stainless steel
 protects the aluminum core from corrosion during cell operation, while providing the
 superior material properties of aluminum, such as, high strength-to-weight ratio, high
 thermal and electrical conductivity, etc. In other embodiments, first component 801
 can comprise anodized, sealed, and primed aluminum.
          [099] In some embodiments, first component 801 can be formed of a
 composite, such as, carbon fiber, graphite, glass-reinforce polymer, thermoplastic
 composites. In some embodiments, first component 801 can be formed of a metal
 which is coated to prevent both corrosion and electrical conduction.
          [0100] According to various embodiments, first component 801 can be
 generally non-conductive reducing the likelihood of shorting between the
 electrochemical cells. Second component 802 can be formed of one or more
  materials that provide electrical conductivity as well as corrosion resistance during
  cell operation. For example, second component 802 can be configured to be
  electrically conductive in the region where the active cell components sit (e.g., flow
  structure, MEA, etc.).

         [0101] First component 801 and second component 802 can be configured for
 coplanar coupling. First component 801 and second component 802 can be
 releasably coupled or fixedly coupled. One or more attachment mechanisms can be
 used including, for example, bonding material, welding, brazing, soldering, diffusion
 bonding, ultrasonic welding, laser welding, stamping, riveting, resistance welding, or
 sintering. In some embodiments, the bonding material may include an adhesive.
 Suitable adhesives include, for example, glues, epoxies, cyanoacrylates,
 thermoplastic sheets (including heat bonded thermoplastic sheets) urethanes,
 anaerobic, UV-cure, and other polymers. In some embodiments, first component 801
 and second component 802 can be coupled by a friction fit. For example, one or
 more seals between the components can produce adequate frictional force between
 the components when compressed to prevent unintended sliding.
         [0102] In other embodiments, first component 801 and second component
 802 can be releasably coupled using fasteners, for example, screws, bolts, clips, or
 other similar mechanisms. In other embodiments, compression rods and nuts can
 pass through bipolar plate 800 or along the outside and be used to compress first
 component 801 and second component 802 together as electrochemical cell 100 or
 a plurality of electrochemical cells 100 are compressed in a stack,
         [0103) Coupled first component 801 and second component 802 can form a
 plurality of different pressure zones and a plurality of seals can define one or more
 different pressure zones. FIG. 8 shows the plurality of different seals and pressure
 zones. As shown in FIG. 8, the plurality of seals can include a first seal 871, a
 second seal 881, and a third seal 891. First seal 871 can be contained entirely
 within second seal 881 and second seal 881 can be contained entirely within third
 seal 891. The shape of first seal 871, second seal 881, and third seal 891 can
 generally correspond to the shape of bipolar plate 800, as shown in FIG. 8.
         [0104] First seal 871, second seal 881, and third seal 891 can be a gasket, 0
 ring, or other sealing component. First seal 871, second seal 881, and third seal 891
 can be made of an elastomeric or polymeric sealing material, for example, silicone,
  EPDM (ethylenepropylene-diene-monomer), fluoroelastomer, nitrile rubber (Buna-N),
  PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), polysulfone, polyetherimide, polychenylene sulfide,
  PEEK (polyether ether ketone), polyimide , PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PEN

 rubber), etc. The material of each seal can be different than the material of the
 other seals, the material can be the same for just two of the seals, or the material
 can be the same for all the seals.
        [0105] In some embodiments, first seal 871, second seal 881, and third seal
 891 can be a knife-edge type seal or an adhesively-bonded seal. For example,
 second component 802 can include protrusions or "teeth" like projections in the
 location of first seal 871 configured to plastically deform first seal 871. In yet another
 example, an adhesively-bonded seal can be formed by a continuous, void and gap
 free application of an adhesive. In other embodiments, first seal 171, second seal
 181, and third seal 191 can be formed of flat gasket material that can be cut in an
 enlarging pattern configured to maintain the cascade configuration. In another
 embodiment, a thin plastic sheet can be placed in between first component 801 and
 second component 802 which forms a gasket seal under a compressive load of the
 electrochemical cell or stack.
         [0106] First seal 871 can define a portion of high pressure zone 870 and be
 configured to contain a first fluid 872 (e.g., hydrogen) within high pressure zone 870.
 First seal 871 can delimit the outer boundaries of high pressure zone 870 at least
 between components 801 and 802. High pressure zone 870 can include flow
 structure 805 extending through void 803 when first component 801 and second
 component 802 are coupled. First fluid 872 can flow throughout high pressure zone
 870 thorough flow structure 805 from cathode 130.
         [0107] Hydrogen formed at cathode 130 can be collected in high pressure
 zone 870 and the connection between first component 801 and second component
 802 can be sealed by first seal 871. Hydrogen within high pressure zone 870 can be
 compressed and, as a result, increase in pressure as more and more hydrogen is
 formed in high pressure zone 870. Hydrogen in high pressure zone 870 can be
 compressed to a pressure greater than 15,000 psi. Pressure within high pressure
 zone 870 can apply a separation force on first component 801 and second
 components 802.
         [0108] As shown in FIG. 8, first seal 871 can be configured to extend around
 the exterior of common passages 804. Common passages 804 can be configured to
 supply or discharge first fluid 872 from high pressure zone 870. Common passages
 804 can be in fluid communication with common passages of adjacent
 electrochemical cells in a multi-cell electrochemical compressor.

         [0109] Second seal 881 can define the outer circumference of intermediate
 pressure zone 880. Intermediate pressure zone 880 can comprise an intermediate
 pressure volume 883 delimited by first seal 871, second seal 881, first component
 801 and second component 802. Intermediate pressure zone 880 can be configured
 to contain a second fluid 882. Intermediate pressure zone 880 can further comprise
 one or more intermediate pressure ports 884.
         [0110] Intermediate pressure volume 883 can be configured to collect and
 direct second fluid 882 to intermediate pressure ports 884. As shown in FIG. 8,
 intermediate pressure volume 883 can extend around the circumference of high
 pressure zone 870 separated by first seal 871. The cross-sectional area and volume
 of intermediate pressure volume 883 can vary based on the geometry of first
 component 801, second component 802, first seal 871, and second seal 881.
         [0111] In other embodiments, intermediate pressure volume 883 can be
 separated into a plurality of intermediate pressure volumes 883, for example, 2, 3, 4
 or more intermediate pressure volumes 883. The plurality of intermediate pressure
 volumes 883 can be separated by a plurality of seals. As shown in FIG. 8,
 intermediate pressure volume 883 can be separated into two intermediate pressure
 volumes 883. For example, as shown in FIG. 8, first seal 871 can extend across
 intermediate pressure volume 883 to second seal 881. The portions of first seal 881
 that extend around common passages 804 can connect with second seal 882
 separating intermediate pressure volume 883 into two intermediate pressure
 volumes 883.
         [01121 As shown in FIG. 8, the one or more intermediate pressure volumes
 883 can each be in fluid communication with one or more intermediate pressure
 ports 884. Intermediate pressure ports 884 can be configured to discharge second
 fluid 882 contained within intermediate pressure volumes 883. The shape of
 intermediate pressure ports 884 can vary. For example, intermediate pressure ports
 884 can be square, rectangle, triangle, polygon, circle, oval, or other shape. The
  number of intermediate pressure ports 884 per intermediate pressure volume 883
  can vary from 1 to about 25 or more. The cross-sectional area of intermediate
  pressure ports 884 can vary. For example, the diameter of circular intermediate
  pressure ports 884 can range from less than about 0.1 inch to about 1 inch or more.
 As shown in FIG. 8, intermediate pressure ports 884 can be evenly spaced between
 first seal 871 and second seal 881 and evenly distributed along the length of bipolar

 full circumference of intermediate pressure zone 880.
          [0113] Second fluid 882 discharged via intermediate pressure ports 884 can
 be resupplied to electrochemical cell 100. For example, second fluid 882 can return
 to intermediate pressure zone 180. In other embodiments, second fluid 882
 discharged via intermediate pressure ports 884 can be collected and recycled.
 Second fluid 882 in intermediate pressure zone 880 can generally be lower pressure
 than first fluid 872 in high pressure zone 870.
          [0114] Third seal 891 can define low pressure zone 890 and be configured to
 contain a third fluid 892 within low pressure zone 890. Low pressure zone 890 can
 comprise a low pressure volume 893 delimited by second seal 881, third seal 891,
 first component 801, and second component 802. Low pressure zone 890 can be
 configured to contain a third fluid 892. Low pressure zone 890 can further comprise
 one or more low pressure ports 894.
          [0115] Low pressure volume 893 can be configured to collect and direct third
 fluid 892 to low pressure ports 894. As shown in FIG. 8, low pressure volume 893
 can extend around the circumference of intermediate pressure zone 880 separated
 by second seal 881. The cross-sectional area and volume of low pressure volume
 893 can vary based on the geometry of first component 801, second component
 802, second seal 881, and third seal 891. According to various embodiments, the
  intermediate pressure volume 883 can be greater than or less than the volume of low
  pressure volume 893.
           [0116] In other embodiments, low pressure volume 893 can be separated into
  a plurality of intermediate pressure volumes 893, for example, 2, 3, 4 or more low
  pressure volumes 893. The plurality of low pressure volumes 893 can be separated
  by a plurality of seals. As shown in FIG. 9, low pressure volume 893 can be
  separated into two low pressure volumes 893. For example, one or more bridge
  seals 895 can extend across low pressure volume 883 from second seal 881 to third
  seal 891.
           [0117] As shown in FIG. 8, the one or more low pressure volumes 893 can
  each be in fluid communication with one or more low pressure ports 894. Low
  pressure ports 894 can be configured to discharge third fluid 892 contained within
  low pressure volumes 893. The shape of low pressure ports 894 can vary. For
  example, low pressure ports 894 can be square, rectangle, triangle, polygon, circle,

 oval, or other shape. The number of low pressure ports 894 per low pressure
 volume 893 can vary from 1 to about 50 or more. The cross-sectional area of low
 pressure ports 894 can vary. For example, the diameter of circular low pressure
 ports 894 can range from less than about 0. 1 inch to about 1 inch or more. As
 shown in FIG, 8, low pressure ports 894 can be spaced between second seal 881
 and third seal 891 and evenly staggered along the length of bipolar plate 800. In
 other embodiments, low pressure ports 894 can extend the full circumference of low
 pressure zone 890.
         [0118] Third fluid 892 discharged via low pressure ports 894 can be
 resupplied to electrochemical cell 100. For example, third fluid 892 can return to low
 pressure zone 190. In other embodiments, third fluid 892 discharged via
 intermediate pressure ports 894 can be collected and recycled. Third fluid 892 in low
 pressure zone 890 can generally be lower pressure than first fluid 872 in high
 pressure zone 870 and second fluid 882 in intermediate pressure zone 880.
         [0119] The cascade seal configuration between first component 801 and
 second component 802 as described above can be implemented in bipolar plate 150
 and 160 of electrochemical cell 100, as described above. In other embodiments, the
 cascade seal configuration between components 801 and 802 can be implemented
 in other electrochemical cells in which a cascade seal configuration is not utilized
 between the two bipolar plates. Therefore, both cascade seal configurations as
 described above can be independent of one another such that either one can be
 utilized individually in a electrochemical cell or they can be utilized in conjunction in
 the same electrochemical cell.
         [0120] In some embodiments, first component 801 and second component
 802 can include interlocking features. The interlocking features may form a mating
 geometry sufficient to secure first component 801 and second component 802
 together. For example, first component 801 may comprise one or more protrusions,
 and second component 802 may comprise one or more indentations. However, it is
 further contemplated first component 801 and second component 802 may comprise
 various attachment mechanisms. Interlocking features may comprise various
 shapes and sizes. For example, protrusions and indentations may be formed
 cylindrical, round, elliptical, rectangular, or square in shape. Additionally, protrusions
 and indentations may include various polygonal shapes.

          [0121] As shown in FIG. 8, interlocking features may include various
 connections configured to seal first component 801 and second component 802. For
 example, interlocking features may include first seal 871, second seal 881, and third
 seal 891 and the corresponding seal cavity in which they can rest. First component
 801 and second component 802 can include a plurality of seal cavities configured to
 receive at least a portion of first seal 871, second seal 881, and third seal 891. Each
 seal cavity can comprise an extrusion into first component 801, second component
 802 or both components 801 and 802. The extrusion dimensions and geometry can
 correspond to the dimensions and cross-sectional geometry of first seal 871, second
 seal 881, and third seal 891.
          [0122] In other embodiments, the number of pressure zones between first
 component 801 and second component 802 can be greater than or less than three
 (i.e., high, intermediate, and low). For example, a first component 801 and second
 component 802 could comprise just two pressure zones (e.g., high and low) or could
 comprise four or more pressure zones (eg., high-high, high, intermediate, and low).
 In yet another embodiment, the pressure zones could cascade, but not cascade
 down sequentially in pressure. [CAN FURTHER DETAIL BE PROVIDED]
          [0123] A bipolar plate similar to bipolar plate 800 having just two pressure
 zones could comprise a first component, a second component, a seal formed
 between the two components separating the two pressure zones, a volume
 surrounding the seal, and at least one port in fluid communication with the volume
 configured to discharged fluid collected in the volume.
          [0124] In other embodiments, it is contemplated that the volume surrounding
 can be configured to extend around only a portion of the seal. For example, volume
 chambers could be distributed around the circumference of each seal within each
 pressure zone.
          [0125] During operation, the cascade seal configuration between first
 component 801 and second component 802, as described above, can enable
 collection and recycling or reclamation of fluid leaked from high pressure zone 870 to
 intermediate pressure zone 880 and low pressure zone 890 between components
 801 and 802. As mentioned above, first fluid 872 within high pressure zone 870 can
 be compressed to pressures exceeding 15,000 psi. The pressure of first fluid 872
 can apply a separation force on first seal 871, first component 801, and second
 component 802. When the coupling force of first component 801 and second
                                              -28 -

WO 2014/134295                                                             PCT/US2014/018996
 component 802 is sufficient to counter act the separation force and maintain the
 connection and first seal 871 is functioning properly, then first fluid 871 can be
 prevented from leaking from high pressure zone 870 past first seal 871 into
 intermediate pressure zone 880.
         [0126] On the other hand, when the coupling force is insufficient to maintain
 the connection or first seal 871 malfunctions the first fluid 872 can leak from high
 pressure zone 870 past first seal 871 into intermediate pressure zone 880. First fluid
 872 leaked into intermediate pressure zone 880 can be collected in intermediate
 pressure volume 883 and constitute second fluid 882. First fluid 872 / second fluid
 882 collected in intermediate pressure volume 883 can flow to and out through
 intermediate pressure ports 884. The discharged fluid (i.e., first fluid 872 / second
 fluid 882) can be recycled or reclaimed rather than lost, which was traditionally the
 case in other two-piece bipolar designs.
         [0127] Low pressure zone 890 can provide an additional level of leak
 protection. Second fluid 882 that leaks past second seal 881 can be collected in low
 pressure volume 893 and constitute third fluid 892. Second fluid 882 / third fluid 892
 collected can flow to and out through low pressure ports 894. Like the other
 discharged fluid, second fluid 882 / third fluid 892 can be recycled or reclaimed.
 Flow through intermediate pressure ports 884 and low pressure ports 894 can be
 controlled down steam. For example, one or more valves can open or close to allow
 fluid to be discharged. The flow through intermediate pressure ports 884 can be
 continuous or intermittent.
         [0128] The method of using the cascade seal configuration can comprises
 collecting fluid (e.g., first fluid 872, second fluid 882, and third fluid 892) within
 different volumes (e.g., intermediate pressure volume 883 or low pressure volume
 893) separated by a plurality of seals (e.g., first seal 871, second seal 881, and third
 seal 891) and discharging the collected fluid through pressure ports (e.g.,
  intermediate pressure ports 884 and low pressure ports 894) and then recycling the
 discharged fluid.
