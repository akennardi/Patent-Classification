                                                Field of the Invention
10              This invention relates generally to immune function and to enhancing T-cell function,
   including the upregulation of cell-mediated immune responses and to the treatment of T cell
   dysfunctional disorders.
                                             Background of the Invention
15              Co-stimulation or the provision of two distinct signals to T-cells is a widely accepted model
   of lymphocyte activation of resting T lymphocytes by antigen-presenting cells (APCs).            Lafferty et
   al., Aust. J. Exp. Biol. Med. Sci. 53: 27-42 (1975).           This   model    further  provides   for   the
   discrimination of self from non-self and immune tolerance. Bretscher et al., Science 169: 1042-1049
   (1970); Bretscher, P.A., P.N.A.S. USA 96: 185-190 (1999); Jenkins et al., J. Exp. Med. 165: 302-319
20 (1987).        The primary signal, or antigen specific signal, is transduced through the T-cell receptor
   (TCR) following recognition of foreign antigen peptide presented in the context of the major
   histocompatibility-complex (MHC).           The second or co-stimulatory signal is delivered to T-cells by
   co-stimulatory molecules expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and induce T-cells to
   promote clonal expansion, cytokine secretion and effector function.             Lenschow et al., Ann. Rev.
25 Immunol. 14:233 (1996). In the absence of co-stimulation, T-cells can become refractory to antigen
   stimulation, do not mount an effective immune response, and further may result in exhaustion or
   toleranceto foreign antigens.
                The simple two-signal model can be an oversimplification because the strength of the TCR
   signal actually has a quantitative influence on T-cell activation and differentiation.         Viola et al.,
30 Science 273: 104-106 (1996); Sloan-Lancaster, Nature 363: 156-159 (1993).                 Moreover, T-cell
   activation can occur even in the absence of co-stimulatory signal if the TCR signal strength is high.
   More importantly, T-cells receive both positive and negative secondary co-stimulatory signals. The
   regulation of such positive and negative signals is critical to maximize the host's protective immune
   responses, while maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity.
                                                           1
   10250257 1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

                Negative secondary signals seem necessary for induction of T-cell tolerance, while positive
   signals promote T-cell activation.               While the simple two-signal model still provides a valid
   explanation for naive lymphocytes, a host's immune response is a dynamic process, and co
   stimulatory signals can also be provided to antigen-exposed T-cells.
 5              The mechanism of co-stimulation is of therapeutic interest because the manipulation of co
   stimulatory signals has shown to provide a means to either enhance or terminate cell-based immune
   response. Recently, it has been discovered that T cell dysfunction or anergy occurs concurrently with
   an induced and sustained expression of the inhibitory receptor, programmed death 1 polypeptide (PD
    1).   As a result, therapeutic targeting PD-i and other molecules which signal through interactions
10 with PD-1, such as programmed death ligand 1 (PD-LI) and programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2) are
   an area of intense interest.          The inhibition of PD-Li signaling has been proposed as a means to
   enhance T cell immunity for the treatment of cancer (e.g., tumor immunity) and infection, including
   both acute and chronic (e.g., persistent) infection. However, as an optimal therapeutic directed to a
   target in this pathway has yet to be commercialized, a significant unmet medical need exists.

   including infection (e.g., actue and chronic) and tumor immunity.

         1.            Host Immunity
                A.            Lymphocyte development and activation
                The two major types of lymphocytes in humans are T (thymus-derived) and B (bone marrow
   derived. These cells are derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow and fetal liver
 5 that have committed to the lymphoid development pathway. The progeny of these stem cells follow
   divergent pathways to mature into either B or T lymphocytes.            Human B-lymphocyte development
   takes place entirely within the bone marrow. T cells, on the other hand, develop from immature
   precursors that leave the marrow and travel through the bloodstream to the thymus, where they
   proliferate and differentiate into mature T lymphocytes.
10              Mature lymphocytes that emerge from the thymus or bone marrow are in a quiescent, or
   "resting" state, i.e., they are mitotically inactive. When dispersed into the bloodstream, these "naive"
   or "virgin" lymphocytes, travel into various secondary or peripheral lymphoid organs, such as the
   spleen, lymph nodes or tonsils. Most virgin lymphocytes have an inherently short life span and die
   without a few days after leaving the marrow or thymus. However, if such a cell receives signals that
15 indicate the presence of an antigen, they may activate and undergo successive rounds of cell division.
   Some of the resulting progeny cells then revert to the resting state to become memory lymphocytes
   B and T cells that are essentially primed for the next encounter with the stimulating allergen. The
   other progeny of activated virgin lymphocytes are effector cells, which survive for only a few days,
   but carry out specific defensive activities.
20              Lymphocyte activation refers to an ordered series of events through which a resting
   lymphocyte passes as it is stimulated to divide and produce progeny, some of which become effector
   cells.       A full response includes both the induction of cell proliferation (mitogenesis) and the
   expression of immunologic functions. Lymphocytes become activated when specific ligands bind to
   receptors on their surfaces.           The ligands are different for T cells and B cells, but the resulting
25 intracellular physiological mechanisms are similar.
                 Some foreign antigens themselves can induce lymphocyte activation, especially large
   polymeric antigens that cross-link surface immunoglobulins on B-cells, or other glycoproteins on T
   cells. However, most antigens are not polymeric and even direct binding to B-cells in large numbers
   fail to result in activation. These more common antigens activate B cells when they are co-stimulated
30 with nearby activated helper T-lymphocytes. Such stimulation may occur from lymphokines secreted
   by the T-cell, but is transmitted most efficiently by direct contact of the B cell with T-cell surface
   proteins that interact with certain B-cell surface receptors to generate a secondary signal.
                                                            13
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

                B.            T-cells
                T lymphocytes do not express immunoglobulins, but, instead detect the presence of foreign
   substances by way of surface proteins called T-cell receptors (TCR).                     These receptors recognize
   antigens by either direct contact or through influencing the activity of other immune cells. Together
 5 with macrophages, T cells are the primary cell type involved in the cell-mediated immunity.
                 Unlike B-cells, T-cells can detect foreign substances only in specific contexts. In particular,
   T-lymphocytes will recognize a foreign protein only if it first cleaved into small peptides, which are
   then displayed on the surface of a second host cell, called an antigen-presenting cell (APC). Many
   types of host cells can present antigens under some conditions but certain types are more specifically
10 adapted for this purpose and are particularly important in controlling T-cell activity, including
   macrophages and other B-cells. Antigen presentation depends in part on specific proteins, called
   major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, on the surface of the presenting cells. Thus, to
   stimulate cell-mediated immunity, foreign peptides must be presented to T-cells in combination with
   MHC peptides, and this combination must be recognized by a T-cell receptor.
15               There are two significant T-cell subsets: cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tc cells or CTLs) and
   helper T cells            (TH)     cells, which can roughly be identified on the basis of cell surface expression of
   the marker CD8 and CD4. Tc cells are important in viral defense, and can kill viruses directly by
   recognizing certain cell surface expressed viral peptides.                TH cells promote proliferation, maturation
   and immunologic function of other cell types, e.g., lymphokine secretion to control activities of B
20 cells, macrophages and cytotoxic T cells. Both virgin and memory T-lymphocytes ordinarily remain
   in the resting state, and in this state they do not exhibit significant helper or cytotoxic activity. When
   activated, these cells undergo several rounds of mitotic division to produce daughter cells. Some of
   these daughter cells return to the resting state as memory cells, but others become effector cells that
   actively express helper or cytotoxic activity. These daughter cells resemble their parents: CD4+ cells
25 can only product CD4+ progeny, while CD8+ cells yield only CD8+ progeny.                            Effector T-cells
   express cell surface markers that are not expressed on resting T-cells, such as CD25, CD28, CD29,
   CD40L, transferrin receptors and class II MHC proteins. When the activating stimuli is withdrawn,
   cytotoxic or helper activity gradually subsides over a period of several days as the effector cells
   either die or revert to the resting state.
30               Similar to B-cell activation, T-lymphocyte responses to most antigens also require two types
   of simultaneous stimuli. The first is the antigen, which if appropriately displayed by MHC proteins
   on an antigen-presenting cell, can be recognized and bound by T-cell receptors. While this antigen
   MHC complex does send a signal to the cell interior, it is usually insufficient to result in T-cell
   activation.           Full activation, such as occurs with helper T-cells, requires costimulation with other
35 specific ligands called costimulators that are expressed on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell.
                                                                   14
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   Activation of a cytotoxic T cell, on the other hand, generally requires IL-2, a cytokine secreted by
   activated helper T cells.
                 C.           The Immune Response
 5              The three primary functional properties of the mammalian immune system distinguishing it
   from the other body's defenses include: (1) specificity - the ability to recognize and respond or not to
   respond individually among a vast number of target molecules, (2) discrimination - the ability to
   determine self from non-self so as to peacefully coexist with all the innumerable proteins and other
   organic material, yet still respond vigorously against foreign material that is introduced to the body,
10 and (3) memory - the ability to be molded by experience such that subsequent encounters with a
   particular foreign pathogen will provoke a more rapid and vigorous response than what occurred at
   the initial encounter.             When one or more of these functions is frustrated, a pathological condition
   results.
                 Virgin lymphocytes are continually released from the primary lymphoid organs into the
15 periphery, each carrying surface receptors that enable antigen binding. Antigen binding in B cells is
   mediated through surface-bound immunoglobulins, whereas in T-cells it is mediated by T-cell
   receptors. When virgin lymphocytes are activated, they proliferate, yielding daughter cells that may
   then undergo further cycles of activation and proliferation. The speed and intensity of response to a
   given antigen is determined largely by clonal selection: the larger the population of daughter cells or
20 clones specific to a particular antigen, the greater the number of cells that can recognize and
   participate in the immune response. Every immune response is complex and intricately regulated
   sequence of events involving several cell types. It is triggered when an immunogen enters the body
   and encounters a specialized class of cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs).               These APCs
   capture a minute amount of the immunogen and display it in a form that can be recognized by
25 antigen-specific helper T-lymphocytes.             The helper T cells then become activated and, in turn,
   promote activation of other classes of lymphocytes, such as B cells or cytotoxic T cells.                 The
   activated lymphocytes then proliferate and carry out their specific effector functions. At each stage
   in this process, the lymphocytes and APCs communicate with one another through direct contact or
   by secreting regulatory cytokines.
30               Exogenous antigens that are captured by an APC undergo a series of alterations called
   antigenprocessing. Such processing, especially of proteinaceous immunogens involves denaturation
   and partial proteolytic digestions, so that the immunogen is cleaved into short peptides. A limited
   number of the resulting peptides then associated non-covalently with class II MHC proteins and are
   transported to the APC surface, a process known as antigen presentation. A CD4+ helper T
35 lymphocyte that comes into direct contact with an APC may become activated, but it will do so only
                                                             15
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   if it expressed a T-cell receptor protein that can recognize and bind the particular peptide-MHC
   complex presented by the APC.
                Helper T          (TH)  cells are the principal orchestrators of the immune response because they are
   needed for activation of the two other lymphatic effector cells: cytotoxic T (Tc) cells and antibody
 5 secreting plasma cells.                TH activation occurs early in an immune response and requires at least two
   signals. One signal is provided by binding of the T-cell antigen receptor to the antigenic peptide
   MHC complex on the APC surface that is transmitted through the CD3 protein complex, while the
   second, costimulatory signal through the APC is thought to result from binding of a separate signal
   transmitting protein on the T-cell surface with a specific ligand on the APC.                        One known such
10 interaction is the T-cell protein CD28 and the family of APC surface proteins known as B7. Other
   surface proteins pairs may also mediate costimulation. The process of co-stimulation is described in
   greater detail subsequently.                 The anti-PD-Li antibodies of the present invention are believed to
   enhance co-stimulation through antagonisism of a negative costimulatory signal provided by
   signaling through PD-Li.
15              Together, the two signals induce the helper T cell to begin secreting the cytokine interleukin
   2 (IL-2) and also to begin expressing specific high affinity IL-2 receptors on its surface. IL-2 is a
   highly potent mitogenic factor for T-lymphocytes and is essential for the proliferative response of
   activated T-cells. The effect of IL-2 on the cell from which it is secreted - a phenomenon known as
   an autocrine effect. It has further been shown that even if a T-cell has received both signals, it will
20 not proliferate if its own surface IL-2 receptors are blocked.                     IL-2 can also act on cells in the
   immediate vicinity, in a so-calledparacrineeffect. This effect is especially important to activate Tc
   cells, which generally do not produce enough IL-2 to stimulate their own proliferation. In addition to
   IL-2, activated           TH    cells secrete other cytokines and promote the growth, differentiation, and functions
   of B-cells, macrophages and other cell types.
25              The contact between an APC and an antigen-specific               TH cell also has effect on the APC - one
   of the most important of which is the release of IL-1. This cytokine is believed to act in an autocrine
   manner to increase surface expression of class II MHC proteins and of various adhesion molecules
   thereby strengthening the binding of the                  TH cell and enhancing antigen presentation. At the same
   time, IL-I functions in a paracrine manner on the                 TH cell to promote IL-2 secretion and IL-2 receptor
30 expression.
                 During activation of TH cells in the manner previously described, some B-cells may also have
   been engaging the immunogen through their antigen receptors, which are membrane-bound forms of
   the antibodies that they will later secrete. Unlike T-cells, B-cells recognize an immunogen in its free,
   unprocessed form.                  Specific antigen binding provides one type of signal that can lead to B-cell
35 activation. A second type is provided by activated                 TH cells, which express proteins that help activate
                                                                    16
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   the B cell by binding to non-immunoglobulin receptors on its surface.                These TH-derived signals,
   which act on any B cell regardless of its antigen specificity, are known as helper factors.              These
   helper factors include IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6. However, help is more efficiently achieved through cell
   cell contact, which allows proteins on the T-cell surface to directly contact those on the B cell. The
 5 most effect form of contact-mediated help occurs when a protein called CD40 ligand (CD40L), which
   is expressed on TH cells only after they become activated, binds to a protein called CD40 on B cells.
   In a process known as by-stander activation, contact with an activated B cell can even be sufficient to
   activate resting B cells even though its surface immunoglobulins have not engaged in antigen.
                 Tc lymphocytes function to eradicate cells that express foreign antigens on their surfaces,
10 such as virus-infected host cells. Most Tc cells express CD8 rather than CD4 and hence recognize
   antigens in association with class I rather than class II MHC proteins.               When a somatic cell is
   infected by a virus, some immunogenic viral proteins may undergo processing within the cell, and the
   resulting peptides may then appear as surface complexes with class I MHC molecules.                      These
   peptide-MHC complexes may then be recognized by the T-cell receptor of an antigen-specific clone,
15 providing one of two signals necessary for Tc-cell activation. This first signal alone induces high
   affinity IL-2 receptors on the Tc cell. The second signal is furnished by IL-2 secreted from a nearby
   activated       TH     lymphocyte. On receiving both signals, the activated Tc cell acquires cytotoxic activity,
   enabling it to kill the cell to which it is bound, as well as any other cells bearing the same peptide
   MHC class I complexes. In some cases, killing occurs because the Tc releases specific toxins onto
20 the target cell; in others, the Tc induces the target cell to commit suicide by apoptosis. The activated
   Tc cell also proliferates, giving rise to additional Tc cells with the same antigen specificity.
                 D.             Co-stimulation by the Immunoglobulin Superfamily:
25                             1.      B7.1/B7.2 - CD28/CTLA-4
                Perhaps the best characterized T-cell costimulatory pathway is the one that signals through
   B7.1(CD80)/B7.2(CD86)                 - CD28/CTLA-4(CD152).       This signaling pathway is critical to T-cell
   activation and tolerance. Karandikar et al., J. Neuroimmunol. 89: 10-18 (1998); Oosterwegal et al.,

   3201-3210 (1990).                  CD28 is constitutively expressed on the surface of T cells [Gross et al., J.
   Immunol. 149: 380-388 (1992)], while CTLA-4, the higher affinity receptor, has expression that is
   rapidly upregulated following T-cell activation. Peach et al., J. Exp. Med. 180: 2049-2058 (1994);

   Linsley et al., Immunity 4: 535-543 (1996).                 Most APC populations express B7.2 constitutively at
   low levels, which is rapidly upregulated, while B7.1 is inducibly expressed later after activation.
   Freeman et al., Science 262: 909-911 (1993); Hathcock et al., J. Exp. Med. 180: 631-640 (1994). The
   prior expression of B7.2 and mouse knock-out data suggest that B7.2 is the more important co
10 stimulatory molecule for initiating immune responses, but otherwise the two molecules have largely
   overlapping functions. McAdam et al., Immuno. Rev. 165: 631-640 (1994).
                 CD28 intereacts with B7.1 and B7.2 to transmit a signal that synergizes with the TCR signal
   to promote T-cell activation. Lenschow et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 165: 233-258 (1996);
   Lanzavecchia et al., Cell 96: 1-4 (1999).               In the absence of a TCR signal, CD28 signaling does not
15 have physiological significance.              CD28 signaling regulates the threshold for T-cell activation and
   significantly decreases the number of TCR engagements needed for T-cell activation. Viola et al.,
   Science 273: 104-106 (1996).                  CD28 activation sustains T-cell responses by promoting T-cell
   survival thereby enabling cytokines to initiate T-cell clonal expansion and differentiation. Thompson
   et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 1333-1337 (1989); Lucas et al., J. Immunol. 154: 5757-5768
20 (1995); Shahinian et al., Science 261: 609-612 (1993); Sperling et al., J. Immunol. 157: 3909-3917
   (1996); Boise et al., Immunity 3: 87-98 (1995).                 CD28 also optimizes the responses of previously
   activated T-cells, promoting interleukin 2 (IL-2) production and T-cell survival.                   While some
   responses are CD28 independent, it is not yet clear whether this is co-stimulation independence
   resulting from strong antigenic simuli, or the result of dependence on other, unknown costimulatory
25 pathways.
                 CTLA-4 activation causes a negative signal, which inhibits TCR- and CD-28 mediated signal
   transduction. CTLA-4 engagement results in the inhibition of IL-2 synthesis and progression through
   the cell cycle and termination of T-cell responses.                 Walunas et al., Immunity 1: 405-413 (1994);
   Walunas et al., J. Exp. Med. 183: 2541-2550 (1996); Krummel et al., J. Exp. Med. 182: 459-466
30 (1995); Brunner et al., J. Immunol. 162: 5813-5820 (1999); Greenwald et al., Immunity 14: 145-155
   (2001). CTLA-4 plays an important role in regulating T-cell responses, including peripheralT-cell
   tolerance. While it is not clear how signaling is coordinated through CTLA-4 and CD28, some
   possibilities include out-competing CD28 for binding to B7, by induction of immunosuppressive
   cytokines, direct antagonism of CD28 signaling and/or TCR-mediated signaling.
                                                                  18
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

                As a result, the antagonism of CTLA-4 (e.g., antagonist anti-CTLA antibodies) and or
   agonizing B7. 1/B7.2/CD28 may be useful to enhance immune response in the treatment of infection
   (e.g., acute and chronic) and tumor immunity.
 5                            2.      ICOS/ICOSL signaling:
                Another pathway of interaction between APC's and T-cells occurs through ICOS (CD278)
   and ICOSL (B7-H2, CD275).                   ICOS/ICOSL signaling promotes T-helper cell differentiation and
   effector function, and is particularly important for interleukin-10 (IL-10) production, but plays a
   more modest role in regulating T cell expansion and IL-2 production, including regulatory T-cells, T
10 cell tolerance and autoimmunity.
                In contrast with CD28, ICOS is not expressed constitutively on naive T-cells, but is induced
   rapidly on T-cells after TCR engagement. Hutloff et al., Nature 397: 263-266 (1999); Yoshinaga et
   al., Nature 402: 827-832 (1999); Beier et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 30: 3707-3717 (2000); Coyle et al.,
   Immunity 13: 95-105 (2000); Mages et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 30: 1040-1047 (2000); McAdam et al., J.
15 Immunol. 165: 5035-5040 (2000).                 This suggests that ICOS provides a co-stimulatory signal to
   activated T cells. While co-stimulation by CD28 enhances ICOS expression, and ICOS expression is
   reduced in the absence of B7.1 and B7.2, ICOS is not entirely dependent on CD28 signals. McAdam
   et al., J. Immunol. 165: 5035-5040 (2000); Aicher et al., J. Immunol. 164: 4689-4696 (2000); Kopf et
   al., J. Exp. Med. 192: 53-61 (2000). ICOS is upregulated on both T-helper type 1 and 2          THI  and TH2)
20 cells during the initial phase of differentiation, but levels remain high on TH2 cells and decrease on
   THI     cells.       The expression pattern of ICOS on T cells in germinal centers.      Beier et al., Eur. J.
   Immunol. 30: 3707-3717 (2000); Mages et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 30: 1040-1047 (2000), indicates a
   role for ICOS in T-cell help for B cells. Functional studies have confirmed this, and even expression
   of ICOS has been confirmed on rat B cells, although not on other species. Tezuka et al., Biochem.
25 Biophys. Res. Commun. 276: 335-345 (2000: McAdam et al., Nature 409: 102-105 (2001); Dong et
   al., Nature 409: 97-101 (2001); Dong et al., J. Immunol. 166: 3659-3662 (2001); Tafuri et al., Nature
   409: 105-109 (2001).
                 One role for ICOS/ICOSL signaling seems to be for regulating cytokine production (e.g., IL
   4, IL-13) by recently activated as well as effector T cells. Hutloff et al., Nature 397: 263-266 (1999);
30 Coyle et al., Immunity 13: 95-105 (2000); Dong et al., Nature 409: 97-101 (2001).               In studies of
   allergic airway disease, TH2 effector function, but not TH2 differentiation, is provided by ICOS
   blockade.           Tesciuba et al., J. Immunol. 167: 1996-2003 (2001).       Indicating that ICOS can also
   regulate       THI       effector function, production of both THI  and TH2 cytokines can be suppressed by
   ICOS-Ig fusion protein upon reactivation in vitro. Kopf et al., J. Exp. Med. 192: 53-61 (2000).
                                                              19
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

                Another potential role for ICOS relates to sustaining         THI responses.  In an experimental
   model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) for multiple sclerosis, a                 THI disease mediated by
   myelin-specific CD4* T cells, shows that the outcome of ICOS blockade might be distinct when
   costimulation is blocked during T-cell priming, then during the effector phase of EAE. Dong et al.,
 5 Nature 409: 97-101 (2001); Rottman et al., Nature Immunol. 2: 605-611 (2001); Sporici et al., Clin.
   Immunol. 100: 277-288 (2001).                 EAE induced by mylelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is
   greatly exacerbated in ICOS-/- knock-out mice, with increased production of IFN-y compared to wild
   type. Similarly, ICOS blockade during induction of EAE, exacerbated the disease also resulting in
   increased IFN-y production. Therefor, ICOS blockade during priming leads to                THI  polarization of
10 the response.             Interestingly, the priming of myelin-specific TCR transgenic T cells in vitro in the
   presence of ICOS-Ig inhibited their ability to induce EAE, in stark contrast to the results of ICOS-Ig
   blockade observed in vivo. Sporici et al., supra. The difference for the opposing outcomes in vitro
   and in vivo is not yet clear, but might reflect a role for ICOS on IL-10 producing regulatory T-cells,
   as well as effector T cells during ICOS blockade in vivo.                Co-stimulation through IL-10 is very
15 effective at enhancing IL-10 production and is more effective than co-stimulation through CD28.
   Hutloffet al., supra. The IL-10, IL-12 regulatory loop is critical in regulating EAE because IL-10          -/-,
   but not IL4 -/- mice develop exacerbated EAE. Segal et al., J. Exp. Med. 187: 537-546 (1998).
                Yet another potential role for ICOS is in enhancing T-cell dependent B-cell humoral
   responses. ICOS-- and ICOSL-/- mice have shown that ICOS is required for T-cell dependent B cell
20 responses.            Hutloff et al., Nature 397:263-66 (1999); Chapoval et al., Nat. Immunol. 2:269-74
   (2001); Coyle et al., Immunity             13: 95-105 (2000); McAdam et al., Nature 409: 102-5 (2001); Tafuri
   et al., Nature 409: 105-9 (2001); Suh et al., Nat. Immunol. 4:899-906 (2003). ICOS-- mice also show
   reduced germinal centers in response to primary immunization, profound defects in germinal center
   formation in response to secondary challenge, and defects in IgG class switching. The role of ICOS
25 in T:B cell interaction was further validated by the identification of homozygous loss of ICOS in T
   cells in patients with adult onset common variable immunodeficiency disease. Grimbacher et al.,
   Nat. Immunol. 4: 261-68 (2003).
                As       a result, agonism of ICOS/ICOSL           (e.g., agonist anti-ICOS   antibodies,  soluble
   ICOS/ICOSL ligand) may be useful to enhance immune response in the treatment of infection (e.g.,
30 acute and chronic) and/or tumor immunity.
                               3.      PD-i pathway:
                 An important negative co-stimulatory signal regulating T cell activation is provided by
   programmed death - 1 receptor (PD-1)(CD279), and its ligand binding partners PD-Li (B7-HI,
35 CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC, CD273). The negative regulatory role of PD-i was revealed by PD-i
                                                               20

   knock outs (Pdcd1-P), which are prone to autoimmunity.                     Nishimura et al., Immunity 11: 141-51
   (1999); Nishimura et al., Science 291: 319-22 (2001).                   PD-i is related to CD28 and CTLA-4, but
   lacks the membrane proximal cysteine that allows homodimerization.                     The cytoplasmic domain of
   PD-i contains an immunoreceptor tyorine-based inhibition motif (ITIM, V/IxYxxL/V).                        PD-i only
 5 binds to PD-LI and PD-L2. Freeman et al., J. Exp. Med. 192: 1-9 (2000); Dong et al., Nature Med.
   5: 1365-1369 (1999); Latchman et al., Nature Immunol. 2: 261-268 (2001); Tseng et al., J. Exp. Med.
    193: 839-846 (2001).
                PD-i can be expressed on T cells, B cells, natural killer T cells, activated monocytes and
   dendritic cells (DCs). PD-i is expressed by activated, but not by unstimulated human CD4* and
10 CD8* T cells, B cells and myeloid cells. This stands in contrast to the more restricted expression of
   CD28 and CTLA-4. Nishimura et al., Int. Immunol. 8: 773-80 (1996); Boettler et al., J. Virol. 80:
   3532-40 (2006). There are at least 4 variants of PD-I that have been cloned from activated human T
   cells, including transcripts lacking (i) exon 2, (ii) exon 3, (iii) exons 2 and 3 or (iv) exons 2 through
   4. Nielsen et al., Cell. Immunol. 235: 109-16 (2005).                 With the exception of PD-1Aex3, all variants
15 are expressed at similar levels as full length PD-i in resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells
   (PBMCs).             Expression of all variants is significantly induced upon activation of human T cells with
   anti-CD3 and anti-CD28.                   The PD-1Aex3 variants lacks a transmembrane domain, and resembles
   soluble CTLA-4, which plays an important role in autoimmunity. Ueda et al., Nature 423: 506-11
   (2003). This variant is enriched in the synovial fluid and sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
20 Wan et al., J. Immunol. 177: 8844-50 (2006).                    The two PD-i ligands differ in their expression
   patterns.           PD-Li          is constitutively expressed on mouse T and B cells, CDs, macrophages,
   mesenchymal stem cells and bone marrow-derived mast cells.                      Yamazaki et al., J. Immunol. 169:
   5538-45 (2002). PD-Li is expressed on a wide range of nonhematopoietic cells (e.g., cornea, lung,
   vascular epithelium, liver nonparenchymal cells, mesenchymal stem cells, pancreatic islets, placental
25 synctiotrophoblasts, keratinocytes, etc.) [Keir et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 26: 677-704 (2008)], and is
   upregulated on a number of cell types after activation.                  Both type I and type II interferons IFN's)
   upregulate PD-Li.                    Eppihimer et al., Microcirculation 9: 133-45 (2002); Schreiner et al., J.
   Neuroimmunol. 155: 172-82 (2004).                      PD-Li expression in cell lines is decreased when MyD88,
   TRAF6 and MEK are inhibited.                        Liu et al., Blood 110: 296-304 (2007).    JAK2 has also been
30 implicated in PD-Li induction. Lee et al., FEBS Lett. 580: 755-62 (2006); Liu et al., Blood 110:
   296-304 (2007).                    Loss or inhibition of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a cellular
   phosphatase that modified phosphatidylinosital 3-kinase (P13K) and Akt signaling, increased post
   transcriptional PD-Li expression in cancers. Parsa et al., Nat. Med. 13: 84-88 (2007).
                PD-L2 expression is more restricted than PD-Li.               PD-L2 is inducibly expressed on DCs,
35 macrophages, and bone marrow-derived mast cells. PD-L2 is also expressed on about half to two
                                                                    21

   thirds of resting peritoneal B 1 cells, but not on conventional B2 B cells.             Zhong et al., Eur.J.
   Immunol. 37: 2405-10 (2007).               PD-L2+ BI cells bind phosphatidylcholine and may be important for
   innate immune responses against bacterial antigens.                Induction of PD-L2 by IFN-y is partially
   dependent upon NF-KB.                Liang et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 33: 2706-16 (2003).  PD-L2 can also be
 5 induced on monocytes and macrophages by GM-CF, IL-4 and and IFN-7.                      Yamazaki et al., J.
   Immunol. 169: 5538-45 (2002); Loke et al., PNAS 100:5336-41 (2003).
                PD-i signaling typically has a greater effect on cytokine production than on cellular
   proliferation, with significant effects on IFN-y, TNF-.               and IL-2 production.   PD-i mediated
   inhibitory signaling also depends on the strength of the TCR signaling, with greater inhibition
10 delivered at low levels of TCR stimulation.                This reduction can be overcome by costimulation
   through CD28 [Freeman et al., J. Exp. Med. 192: 1027-34 (2000)] or the presence of IL-2 [Carter et
   al., Eur. J. Immunol. 32: 634-43 (2002)].
                Evidence is mounting that signaling through PD-LI and PD-L2 may be bidirectional. That is,
   in addition to modifying TCR or BCR signaling, signaling may also be delivered back to the cells
15 expressing PD-LI and PD-L2. While treatment of dendritric cells with a naturally human anti-PD-L2
   antibody isolated from a patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia was not found to upregulate
   MHC II or B7 costimulatory molecules, such cells did produce greater amount of proinflammatory
   cytokines, particularly TNF-. and IL-6, and stimulated T cell proliferation.           Nguyen et al., J. Exp.
   Med. 196: 1393-98 (2002). Treatment of mice with this antibody also (1) enhanced resistance to
20 transplated b16 melanoma and rapidly induced tumor-specific CTL.                    Radhakrishnan et al., J.
   Immunol. 170: 1830-38 (2003); Radhakrishnan et al., Cancer Res. 64: 4965-72 (2004); Heckman et
   al., Eur.J. Immunol. 37: 1827-35 (2007); (2) blocked development of airway inflammatory disease in
   a mouse model of allergic asthma.                  Radhakrishnan et al., J. Immunol. 173: 1360-65 (2004);
   Radhakrishnan et al., J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 116: 668-74 (2005).
25              Further evidence of reverse signaling into dendritic cells ("DC's") results from studies of
   bone marrow derived DC's cultured with soluble PD-I (PD-I EC domain fused to Ig constant region
   - "s-PD-i").               Kuipers et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 36: 2472-82 (2006).    This sPD-I inhibited DC
   activation and increased IL-10 production, in a manner reversible through administration of anti-PD
    1.
30              Additionally, several studies show a receptor for PD-LI or PD-L2 that is independent of PD
    1. B7.I has already been identified as a binding partner for PD-L1. Butte et al., Immunity 27: 111-22
   (2007). Chemical crosslinking studies suggest that PD-Li and B7.1 can interact through their IgV
   like domains. B7.1:PD-LI interactions can induce an inhibitory signal into T cells. Ligation of PD
   LI on CD4+ T cells by B7.1 or ligation of B7.1 on CD4+ T cells by PD-Li delivers an inhibitory
35 signal. T cells lacking CD28 and CTLA-4 show decreased proliferation and cytokine production
                                                               22
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   when stimulated by anti-CD3 plus B7.1 coated beads. In T cells lacking all the receptors for B7.1
   (i.e., CD28, CTLA-4 and PD-Li), T cell proliferation and cytokine production were no longer
   inhibited by anti-CD3 plus B7.1 coated beads. This indicates that B7.1 acts specifically through PD
   LI on the T-cell in the absence of CD28 and CTLA-4.              Similarly, T cells lacking PD-i showed
 5 decreased proliferation and cytokine production when stimulated in the presence of anti-CD3 plus
   PD-Li coated beads, demonstrating the inhibitory effect of PD-Li ligation on B7.1 on T cells. When
   T cells lacking all known receptors for PD-Li (i.e., no PD-i and B7.1), T cell proliferation was no
   longer impaired by anti-CD3 plus PD-Li coated beads. Thus, PD-Li can exert an inhibitory effect
   on T cells either through B7.1 or PD-1.
10              The direct interaction between B7.1 and PD-Li suggests that the current understanding of
   costimulation is incomplete, and underscores the significance to the expression of these molecules on
   T cells. Studies of PD-Li-'- T cells indicate that PD-Li on T cells can downregulate T cell cytokine
   production. Latchman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101: 10691-96 (2004). Because both PD-LI
   and B7.1 are expressed on T cells, B cells, DCs and macrophages, there is the potential for
15 directional interactions between B7.1 and PD-Li on these cells types. Additionally, PD-Li on non
   hematopoietic cells may interact with B7.1 as well as PD-i on T cells, raising the question of whether
   PD-LI is involved in their regulation.       One possible explanation for the inhibitory effect of B7. i:PD
   LI interaction is that T cell PD-Li may trap or segregate away APC B7.1 from interaction with
   CD28.
20              As a result, the antagonism of signaling through PD-Li, including blocking PD-Li from
   interacting with either PD-1, B7.1 or both, thereby preventing PD-Li from sending a negative co
   stimulatory signal to T-cells and other antigen presenting cells is likely to enhance immunity in
   response to infection (e.g., acute and chronic) and tumor immunity.            In addition, the anti-PD-Li
   antibodies of the present invention, may be combined with antagonists of other components of PD
25  i:PD-Li signaling, for example, antagonist anti-PD-i and anti-PD-L2 antibodies.
                              4.      B7-H3
                 Co-stimulatory signals are also provided through B7-H3 (B7RP-2, CD276, PR0352), which
   is broadly expressed in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. Chapoval et al., Nat. Immunol. 2: 269
30 74 (2001). In humans, B7-H3 has both a 41g and a 21g variant, with the 41g form predominating,
   while the 21g variant predominates in the mouse.           Sun et al., J. Immunol. 168: 6294-97 (2002);
   Steinberger et al., J. Immunol. 172: 2352-59 (2004); Ling et al., Genomics 82: 365-77 (2003).
                Recent studies have shown that B7-H3 is both a stimulator and an inhibitor of T cell
   responses. Evidence of stimulatory activation is provided by the following: (1) In combination with
35 anti-CD3, B7-H3/Ig fusions costimulated CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation, and stimulated IFN-y
                                                          23
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   and CD8 lytic activity, Chapoval et al., Nat. Immunol. 2: 269-74 (2001); and (2) Injection of B7-H3
   expression plasmid into tumors of an EL-4 lymphoma model resulted in complete regression of 50%
   of tumors, which was dependent upon CD8+ T cells and NK cells. However, several recent studies
   have shown an inhibitory role for this molecule.       B7-H3-- APC knockouts show a two-fold increase
 5 in alloreative T cell proliferation in an MLR response. Activation of CD4 T cells by anti-CD3 and
   anti-CD28 was inhibited in HLA-DR2 transfected with either form of B7-H3. Ling et al., Genomics
   82: 365-77 (2003). The result was reduced proliferation and production of IFN-y, TNF-a, IL-10 and
   GM-CSF. The reconsiliation of these studies could lie in the existence of two receptors for B7-H3
   with opposing functions, similar to how CD28 and CTLA-4 regulate signaling via B7.1 and B7.2.
10              As a result, the blockaide of B7-H3 signaling may contribute to enhancing immune response
   to infection and tumor immunity when combinined with the anti-PD-LI antibodies of the invention.
                               5.     B7-H4
                The most recent addition to the B7 family is B7-H4 (B7x, B7-S1, B7-H.5, VTCN1,
15 PRO1291), which is a negative regulator of T cell responses. Zang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
   U.S.A. 100 (18), 10388-10392 (2003); Watanabe et al., Nat. Immunol. 4 (7), 670-679 (2003); Prasad,
   et al., Immunity 18(6), 863-873 (2003); Sica et al., Immunity 18 (6), 849-861 (2003). Both human
   and mouse B7-H4 are expressed broadly in both lyphoid (spleen and thymus) and nonlymphoid
   organs (including lung, liver, testis, ovary, placenta, skeletal muscle, pancreas and small intestine).
20 B7-H4 is not detected in normal human tissues by IHC or regulation of B7-H4 at the translational
   level. IHC shows B7-H4 is highly expressed in lung and ovarian tumors, and real-time polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) analysis indicate that mouse B7-H4 also is highly expressed in prostate, lung
   and colon carcinoma cell lines. B7-H4 binds a yet unknown receptor on activated, but not naive T
   cells that is distinct from CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-i and the receptor for B7-H3.          Although BTLA was
25 initially reported to be the ligand for B7-H4, the reported binding of B7-H4/Ig fusions to wild-type,
   but not BTLA-- cells compels the conclusion that HVEM, and not BTLA is the unique ligand for B7
   H4. Sedy et al., Nat. Immunol. 6: 90-98 (2004).
                 Studies with B7-H4 transfectants and immobilized B7-H4/Ig fusions demonstrate that B7-H4
   delivers a signal that inhibits TCR-mediated CD4* and CD8* T cell proliferation, cell-cycle
30 progression in the GO/GI phase, and IL-2 production. Sica et al., Immunity        8: 849-61 (2003); Zang
   et al., PNAS 100: 10388-92 (2003); Prasad et al., Immunity 18: 863-73 (2003). B7.1 costimulation
   cannot overcome B7-H4/Ig induced inhibition.            Blocking anti-B7-H4 antibody increased T cell
   proliferation and IL-2 production in vitro.           In vivo administration of anti-B7-H4 antibody
   commensurate with administration of kehole limpet hemacyanin (KLH) in complete Freund's
35 adjuvant (CFA) led to a modest increase in anti-KLH antibody IgM production and a two- to three

   fold increase in T cell proliferation and IL-2 production upon in vitro restimulation with KLH,
   suggesting greater T cell priming in vivo in the presence of anti-B7-H4.             Anti-B7-H4 blocking
   antibody markedly accelerated the onset and severity of EAE in increased CD4* and CD8* T cells
   and CDllb* macrophages in the brain of anti-B7-H4 treated an autoimmune mouse model. The
 5 combined experimental data available on B7-H4 suggest that it may downegulate immune responses
   in peripheral tissues and play a role in regulating T cell tolerance. The expression of B7-H4 may also
   play a role in evasion of host immune responses in tumor immunity. Choi et al., J. Immunol. 171:
   4650-54 (2003). As a result, the antagonism of B7-H4 may be useful to enhance immune response to
   infection and tumor immunity when combined with the anti-PD-LI antibodies of the invention.

                               6.     BTLA:
                The B7 family member BTLA (CD272, BTLA-1) is functionally similar to PD-I and CTLA.
   Initially identified as a selective marker for Thi cells, BTLA is only expressed on lymphocytes.
   Similar to CTLA-4, ICOS and PD-i, BTLA is induced on T cells during activation.               However, in
15 contrast with ICOS, which remains elevated on Th2-cells, but is downregulated in Thi cells, BTLA
   remains expressed on Thl-cells, but not Th2-cells. Similar to PD-i, BTLA is also expressed on B
   cells. Gavrieli et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 312: 1236-43 (2003). However, BTLA is
   expressed on both resting and activated B cells, whereas PD-i is upregulated on activated B cells.
   BTLA has two ITIM motifs.
20              BTLA exerts inhibitory effects on both B and T lymphocytes.            Watanabe et al., Nat.
   Immunol. 4: 670-79 (2003).             BLTA-/- B cells show modest response to anti-IgM, but an increased
   response to anti-CD3 in vitro.             Polarized BTLA-- Thi cells show about a two-fold increase in
   proliferation in response to antigen exposure, in vitro. In vivo, BTLA-- mice show a three-fold
   increase in hapten-specific antibody responses and enhanced susceptibility to EAE. The phenotype
25 of BTLA-- mice resembles the phenotype of PD-i-- mice, exhibiting increased susceptibility to
   autoimmunity, but more subtle phenotypes than CTLA-4-- mice.                  However, given its role as a
   negative regulator, blockade of BTLA may prove useful for enhancing immune response in infection
   and antitumor immunity when combined with the anti-PD-LI antibodies of the invention.
                 Interestingly, it has recently been shown that the Ig superfamily member BTLA also interacts
30 with the TNFR family member HVEM. Sedy et al., Nat. Immunol. 6: 90-98 (2005); Gonzalez et al.,
   Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102: 1116-1121 (2005). HVEM is reviewed below under TNFR Family
   Costimulators.

                               1.     OX40/OX40L (CD134)
                 OX40 (CD134, TXPGlL, TNFRSF4) and OX40L (CD134L, CD252, GP34, TNFSF4,
   TXGP1) deficient mice have reduced primary CD4+ T-cell responses both to viral and common
 5 protein antigens and in contact-sensitivity reactions. Chen et al., Immunity 11: 689-698 (1999); Kopf
   et al., Immunity 1: 699-708 (1999); Murata et al., J. Exp. Med. 191: 365-374 (2000); Gramaglia et
   al., J. Immunol. 165: 3043-3050 (2000). Lower frequencies of antigen-specific effector T cells are
   generated late in the primary response and fewer memory T cells develop. Gramaglia et al., supra. In
   contrast to T cells deficient in CD27, early proliferation is unimpaired in naive CD4+ T cell
10 populations that are deficient in OX40. However, reduced proliferation and marked apoptotic cell
   death occur 4-5 days after activation, with the result that few T cells survive long term. Rogers et al.,
   Immunity 15: 445-455 (2001).             With OX40-deficient CD8+ T cells, initial cell division is unaffected,
   but the accumulation of primary effector cells is markedly reduced 3-6 days after encounter with
   antigen. Croft et al., Nat. Immunol. 3: 609-620 (2003).
15              Transgenic expression of OX40L by dendritic cells or T cells increased the number of
   antigen-responding CD4+ T cells and produces autoimmune-like symptoms that are associated with
   aberrant T-cell activation.           Brocker et al., Eur.J. Immunol. 29:1610-1616 (1999); Murata et al., J.
   Immunol. 169: 4628-4636 (2002). After immunization, injection of agonist anti-OX40 antibodies
   results in the accumulation of a greater number of antigen-reactive CD4+ T cells at the peak of the
20 primary response, and a concomitant enhancement in the number of memory T cells that are
   generated. Gramaglia et al., supra., Bansai-Pakalaet al., Nature Med. 7: 907-912 (2001), Maxwell et
   al., J. Immunol. 164: 107-112 (2000); Weatherill et al., Cell. Immunol. 209: 63-75 (2001). Enhanced
   accumulation of primary effector CTLs occurs when antigen-primed mice are treated with agonist
   antibody specific for OX40. De Smedt et al., J. Immunol. 168: 661-670 (2002).
25               OX40 is believed to provide a late-acting signal that allow for the survival of newly
   generated effector cells at the peak of the primary immune response. There is also good evidence
   that OX40 functions downstream from CD28 - in addition to increased expression of OX40 mediated
   by CD28 signals, functional analysis of CD28 deficiency versus OX40 deficiency have shown that
   early primary T-cell responses are markedly impaired in the absence of CD28 signals, but only late
30 responses are impaired in the absence of OX40 signals. Rogers et al., Immunity 15: 445-455 (2001);
   Bertram et al., J. Immunol. 168: 3777-3785 (2002).
                As a result, it is likely that activation of OX40/OX40L, such as through the application of
   agonist antibodies may be useful when combined with the anti-PD-LI antibodies of the invention to
   treat T-cell dysfunctional disorders.

                              2.      4-1BB (CD137)/4-1BBL,
                Similar to OX40/OX40L, T-cells that are deficient in 4-1BB (CD137, TNFRSF9) and 4
    1BBL (TNFSF9), show fewer antigen-reactive CD8+ T cells accumulate in primary responses when
   4-1BBL is absent and fewer memory T cells develop. DeBenedette et al., J. Immunol. 163: 4833
 5 4841 (1999); Tan et al., J. Immunol. 163: 4859-4868 (1999); Tan et al., J. Immunol. 164: 2320-2325
   (2000). Also, blocking 4-1BBL does not alter the initial proliferative response of CD8+ T cells, but
   suppresses the accumulation of effector CTLs at the peak of the primary response after 3-6 days,
   owing to apoptosis of cells that have divided several times. Cooper et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 32: 521
   529 (2002). Agonist anti-4-IBB antibodies and anti-4-IBBL-transfected APCs have also produced
10 similar results: CTL and CD4+ T-cell responses are markedly increased in vivo.             Melero et al.,
   Nature Med. 3: 682-685 (1997); Melero et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 28: 1116-1121 (1998); Takahashi et
   al., J. Immunol. 162: 5037-5040 (1999); Guinn et al., J. Immunol. 162: 5003-5010 (1999); Halstead
   et al., Nature Immunol. 3: 536-541 (2002); Takahashi et al., Immunol. Lett. 76: 183-191 (2001);
   Bansal-Pakala et al., J. Immunol. 169: 5005-5009 (2002). 4-IBB-specific antibody does not alter the
15 initial proliferative response, supporting the conclusions from the 4-1BBL blocking experiments and
   pointing to the late activity of 4-IBB in supplying cell-survival signals.
                Like OX40, 4-IBB is believed to provide a late-acting signal that allow for the survival of
   newly generated effector cells at the peak of the primary immune respone.             There is also good
   evidence that 4-1BB functions later than CD28 - in addition to increased expression of OX40 and 4
20 1BB mediated by CD28 signals, functional analysis of CD28 deficiency versus 4-1BB deficiency
   have shown that early primary T-cell responses are markedly impaired in the absence of CD28
   signals, but only late responses are impaired in the absence of OX40 signals. Rogers et al., Immunity
   15: 445-455 (2001); Bertram et al., J. Immunol. 168: 3777-3785 (2002).
                Agonist anti-CD137 antibody can induce tumor regression in cancer wherein CD8+ CTLs
25 play a central role. Melero et al., Nat. Med. 3: 682-5 (1997); Hirano et al., CancerRes. 65(3): 1089
   96 (2005). Constitutive and inducible expression of PD-Li confers resistance is such tumors, which
   is reversible upon blockade of PD-LI. Hirano et al.
                As a result, it is likely that activation of 4-IBB/4-BBL, such as through the application of
   agonist antibodies, particularly in combination with PD-Li antagonists (e.g., anti-PD-Li antibody)
30 may be useful to treat T-cell dysfunctional disorders.
                              3.      CD27/CD27L (CD70)
                The importance of CD27 (TNFRSF7, S152) and CD27L (CD70, TNFSF7) signaling in the
   initial stages of a T-cell response has been demonstrated in in vitro blocking studies, wherein
35 CD27/CD70 interactions were disrupted. Oshima et al., Int. Immunol. 10: 517-526 (1998); Agematsu
                                                            27
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   et al., J. Immunol. 153: 1421-1429 (1994); Hintzen et al., J. Immunol. 154: 2612-2623 (1995).            T
   cells that lack CD27 initially divide normally, but then proliferate poorly 3 or more days after
   activation.            Hendriks et al., Nature Immunol. 1: 433-440 (2000).       This indicates that CD27
   participates in promoting the initial expansion of the naive T-cell population, by either early
 5 suppression of T-cell death or by acting on the cell cycle to allow sustained division 2-3 days after
   activation. This is reinforced by in vivo studies of CD27-deficient mice, in which lower numbers of
   antigen-specific responses (days 4-8) and fewer memory T cells develop over 3 or more weeks.
   Hendriks et al., supra.              The expression of CD27 is upregulated early after T-cell activation,
   suggesting that it mainly delivers signals that maintain early proliferation, before the peak of the
10 effector response.
                As a result, it is likely that activation of CD27/CD27L, including through the application of
   agonist antibodies, particularly in combination with the anti-PD-Li antibodies described herein, may
   be useful to treat T-cell dysfunctional disorders.
15                            4.      CD30/CD30L (CD153)
                 CD30 (TNFRSF8, Ki-1) and CD30L (CD153, TNFSF8) signaling is co-stimulatory for
   several T-cell functions in vitro. Del Prete et al., J. Exp. Med. 182: 1655-1661 (1995), Bowen et al.,
   J. Immunol. 156: 442-449 (1995).            Blocking reagents to CD30L suppressed the development of Th2
   cells and enhanced the development of Thi cells in vitro.           This activity is in agreement with data
20 showing that CD30 is preferentially expressed by Th2 cells and type 2 cytotoxic Tc2 cells. Del Prete
   et al., supra, Nakamura et al., J. Immunol. 158: 2090-2098 (1996). CD30 is expressed 3-4 days after
   the activation of naive T cells in unpolarized primary responses. Nakamura et al., supra, indicating
   that its role is not restricted to type 2 cytokine-dominated responses.
                 While the exact mechanisms of CD30/CD30L signaling is unclear, it has been suggested that
25 it might be similar to OX40 and 4-1BB. When adoptively transferred antigen-specific CD8+ T cells
   are transferred into CD30L-deficient mice, they do not accumulate in high numbers at the peak of a
   primary response, and fewer memory T cells develop.                As a result, CD30 might also provide
   proliferation and/or survival signals to allow the generation of high numbers of antigen-specific T
   cells at the peak of primary responses.
30              As a result, it is likely that activation of CD27/CD27L, including through the application of
   agonist antibodies, particularly in combination with the anti-PD-Li antibodies described herein, may
   be useful to treat T-cell dysfunctional disorders.

                               5.     HVEM/LIGHT
                The effect of HVEM (HVEA, ATAR, LIGHTR, TNFRSF14, PR0509) and LIGHT (CD258,
   HVEML, TR2, TNFSF14, PR0726) on T-cell costimulation is complicated by 1) the ability of
   LIGHT to also bind lympotoxin-$ receptor (LT$R) and 2) HVEM to bind soluble LTac3. Thus, any
 5 study of the effect of HVEM/LIGHT should also take into account the effect of other binding
   partners for this signaling system.         Blocking LIGHT can inhibit early T-cell proliferation and
   cytokine secretion in allogeneic mixed-lymphocyte reactions (MLRs).            Tamada et al., J. Immunol.
    164: 4105-4110 (2000), Kwon et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272: 14272-14276 (1997); Harrop et al., J.
   Immunol. 161: 1786-1794 (1998); Tamada et al., Nature Med. 6: 283-289 (2000). The production of
10 pro-inflammatory cytokines is suppressed when LIGHT is blocked in MHC-mismatched heart
   allografts. Ye et al., J. Exp. Med. 195: 795-800 (2002). Moreover, allogeneic skin grafts are rejected
   with delayed kinetics in recipients that are deficient for both LIGHT and CD28. Scheu et al., J. Exp.
   Med. 195: 1613-1624 (2002). The suggestion that delayed graft rejection might indicate an early
   suppression of T-cell clonal expansion or cytokine production. This conclusion is bolstered by (i) in
15 vitro studies showing that LIGHT-deficient splenocytes responding to alloantigen have reduced
   production of both THI and TH2 cytokines and weak generation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity
   (CTL) activity [Sheu et al., supra.], and (ii) in vivo studies showing that blocking LIGHT reduces the
   generation of alloreactive CTLs. Tamada et al., Nature Med. 6: 283-289 (2000).
                As a result, the HVEM/LIGHT, such as through the application of agonist antibodies,
20 particularly in combination with the anti-PD-Li antibodies described herein, may be useful to treat T
   cell dysfunctional disorders.
   11.          Definitions
                 In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where the context
25 requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word "comprise" or
   variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the
   presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further features in
   various embodiments of the invention.
                An "allergen" or "immunogen' is any molecule that can trigger an immune response. As
30 used herein, the term covers either the antigenic molecule itself, or its source, such as pollen grain,
   animal dander, insect venom or food product. This is contrasted with the term antigen, which refers
   to a molecule that can be specifically recognized by an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. Any
   foreign substance capable of inducing an immune response is a potential allergen. Many different
   chemicals of both natural and synthetic origin are known to be allergenic. Complex natural organic
35 chemicals, especially proteins, are likely to cause antibody-mediated allergy, whereas simple organic
                                                         29
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   compounds, inorganic chemicals, and metals more preferentially cause T-cell mediated allergy. In
   some cases, the same allergen may be responsible for more than one type of allergy. Exposure to the
   allergen may be through inhalation, injection, injection, or skin contact.
                 "Dysfunction " in the context of immune dysfunction, refers to a state of immune reduced
 5 responsiveness to antigenic stimulation. The term includes the common elements of both exhaustion
   and/or anergy in which antigen recognition may occur, but the ensuing immune response is
   ineffective to control infection or tumor growth.
                 "Tolerance" or "immunological tolerance" is the failure of the immune system to mount a
   defensive immune response to a particular antigen. Tolerance can be natural or self, wherein the
10 body does not attack its own proteins and antigens, or it can be induced, resulting from the
   manipulation of the immune system. Central tolerance occurs during lymphocyte development and
   operates in the thymus and bone marrow. During this process, T and B lymphocytes that recognize
   self antigens are deleted before they develop into fully immunocompetent cells. This process is most
   active during fetal development, but continues throughout life as immature lymphocytes are
15 generated. PeripheralT-cell tolerance refers to a functional unresponsiveness to self-antigens that
   are present in peripheral tissues, and occurs after T and B cells mature and enter the periphery.
   These processes include the suppression of autoreactive cells by "regulatory" T cells and the
   generation of hyporesponsiveness (anergy) in lymphocytes which encounter antigen in the absence of
   the co-stimulatory signals that accompany inflammation. "Acquired" or "induced tolerance" refers
20 to the immune system's adaptation to external antigens characterized by a specific non-reactivity of
   the lymphoid tissues to a given antigen that in other circumstances would likely induce cell-mediated
   or humoral immunity. In adults, tolerance may be clinically induced by repeated administration of
   very large doses of antigen, or of small doses that are below the threshold required for stimulation of
   an immune response, such as via intravenous or sublingual administration of soluble antigens.
25 Immunosuppression also facilitates the induction of tolerance. The breakdown of self tolerance can
   lead to autoimmunity.
                 "EnhancingT-cellfunction " means to induce, cause or stimulate a T-cell to have a sustained
   or amplified biological function, or renew or reactivate exhausted or inactive T-cells. Examples of
   enhancing T-cell function include: increased secretion of y-interferon from CD8* T-cells, increased
30 proliferation, increased antigen responsiveness (e.g., viral or pathogen clearance) relative to such
   levels before the intervention.        In one embodiment, the level of enhancement is as least 50%,
   alternatively 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 120%, 150%, 200%.                The manner of measuring this
   enhancement is known to one of ordinary skill in the art.
                A "T cell dysfunctional disorder" is a disorder or condition of T-cells characterized by
35 decreased responsiveness to antigenic stimulation. In a particular embodiment, a T-cell dysfunctional
                                                        30
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   disorder is a disorder that is specifically associated with inappropriate increased signaling through
   PD-1. In another embodiment, T -cell dysfunctional disorder is one in which T-cells are anergic or
   have decreased ability to secrete cytokines, proliferate, or execute cytolytic activity. In a specific
   aspect, the decreased responsiveness results in ineffective control of a pathogen or tumor expressing
 5 an immunogen.                  Examples of T cell dysfunctional disorders characterized by T-cell dysfunction
   include unresolved acute infection, chronic infection and tumor immunity.
                 "Chronic infection" refers to an infection in which an infectious agent (e.g., pathogens such
   as viruses, bacteria, protozoan parasites, fungi, or the like) has induced an immune response in the
   infected host, but has not been cleared or eliminated from that host as during an acute infection.
10 Chronic infections may be persistent, latent, or slow. While acute infections are typically resolved
   by the immune system within a few days or weeks (e.g., influenza), persistent infections can persist at
   a relatively low level for months, years, decades, or a lifetime (e.g., Hepatitis B). In contrast, a latent
   infection is characterized by a long period of asymptomatic activity punctuated by a period of rapidly
   increasing high grade infection and elevated pathogen levels (e.g., herpes simplex). Finally, a slow
15 infection is one characterized by a gradual and continuous increase in disease symptoms, such as a
   long period of incubation followed by a protracted and progressive clinical course beginning after the
   onset of clinical symptoms.                  Unlike latent and persistent infections, slow infection may not begin
   with an acute period of viral multiplication (e.g., picornaviruses infection, visnavirus, scrapie,
   Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease).                 Exemplary infectious agents capable of inducing a chronic infection
20 include viruses (e.g., cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, herpes
   simplex virus, types I and II, human immunodeficiency virus, types 1 and 2, human papillomavirus,
   human T lymphotrophic viruses, types 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus and the like), bacteria (e.g.,
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Listeria spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae,
   Staphylococcus aureus, Borrelia spp., Helicobacterpylori, and the like), protozoan parasites (e.g.,
25 Leishmania spp., Plasmodium falciparum, Schistosoma spp., Toxoplasma spp., Trypanosoma spp.,
   Taenia carssiceps and the like), and fungi (e.g., Aspergillus spp., Candida albicans, Coccidioides
   immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Pneumocystis carinii and the like). Additional infectious agents
   include prions or misfolded proteins that affect the brain or or neuron structure by further
   propagating protein misfolding in these tissues, resulting in the formation of amyloid plaques which

   infection include:                 Creutzfeldt-Jakob  disease and its varieties, Gerstmann-Striussler-Scheinker
   syndrome (GSS), fatal familial insonmia (sFI), kuru, scrapie, Bovine spongiform encephalopathy
   (BSE) in cattle (aka "mad cow" disease), and various other animal forms of encephalopathy [e.g.,
   transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), chronic wasting disease (CWD) in white-tailed deer, elk
                                                                  31

                 "Tumor immunity " refers to the process in which tumors evade immune recognition and
   clearance.            Thus, as a therapeutic concept, tumor immunity is "treated" when such evasion is
 5 attenuated, and the tumors are recognized and attacked by the immune system. Examples of tumor
   recognition include tumor binding, tumor shrinkage and tumor clearance.
                A "B7-negative costimulatory antagonist" ("BNCA") is an agent that decreases, blocks,
   inhibits, abrogates or interferes with the negative co-stimulatory signal mediated by or through cell
   surface proteins expressed on T lymphocytes mediated by a member of the B7 family. In one aspect,
10 a BNCA may either alone, or in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibodies of the invention render a
   dysfunctional T-cell non-dysfunctional. In another aspect, a BNCA may be be an agent that inhibits
   nucleic acid or protein synthesis, expression, signaling, and/or post-expression processing of a B7
   negative costimulatory molecule.              In yet another aspect, a BNCA is an antibody, antigen binding
   antibody fragment, BNCA oligopeptide, BNCA RNAi or BNCA small molecule that decreases,
15 blocks, inhibits, abrogates or interferes with signal transduction by a B7-negative costimulatory
   molecule.           Example B7 negative costimulatory molecules includes: CTLA-4, PD-Li, PD-i, B7.1
   (expressed on T-cells), PD-L2, B7-H3 and B7-H4.
                A positive costimulatory agonist is a molecule that increases, enhances, augments or
   facilitates a co-stimulatory signal mediated by or through cell surface proteins expressed on T
20 lymphocytes.               In one aspect, a positive costimulatory molecule can be an extracellular domain,
   soluble construct or agonist antibody which activates a positive costimulatory pathway.            Example
   positive costimulatory molecules include the B7 superfamily molecules, e.g., B7.1, B7.2, CD28 and
   ICOS/ICOSL.                   Additional examples include the TNFR family costimulatory molecules, e.g.,
   OX40/OX40L, 4 1-BB/4 1-BBL, CD27/CD27L, CD3 0/CD3 OL and HVEM/LIGHT.
25              A "small molecule" or "small organic molecule" is one that has a molecular weight below
   about 500 Daltons.
                An "interfering RNA" "RNAi" is RNA of 10 to 50 nucleotides in length which reduces
   expression of a target gene, wherein portions of the strand are sufficiently complementary (e.g.,
   having at least 80% identity to the target gene). The method of RNA interference refers to the target
30 specific suppression of gene expression (i.e., "gene silencing"), occurring at a post-transcriptional
   level (e.g., translation), and includes all posttranscriptional and transcriptional mechanisms of RNA
   mediated inhibition of gene expression, such as those described in P.D. Zamore, Science 296: 1265
   (2002) and Hannan and Rossi, Nature 431: 371-378 (2004). As used herein, RNAi can be in the form
   of small interfering RNA (siRNA), short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and/or micro RNA (miRNA). Such
35 RNAi molecules are often a double stranded RNA complexes that may be expressed in the form of
                                                              32
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   separate complementary or partially complementary RNA strands. Methods are well known in the art
   for designing double-stranded RNA complexes.               For example, the design and synthesis of suitable
   shRNA and siRNA may be found in Sandy et al., BioTechniques 39: 215-224 (2005).
                A "small interfering RNA" or siRNA is a double stranded RNA (dsRNA) duplex of 10 to 50
 5 nucleotides in length which reduces expression of a target gene, wherein portions of the first strand is
   sufficiently complementary (e.g., having at least 80% identity to the target gene).             siRNAs are
   designed specifically to avoid the anti-viral response characterized by elevated interferon synthesis,
   nonspecific protein synthesis inhibition and RNA degredation that often results in suicide or death of
   the cell associated with the use of RNAi in mammalian cells. Paddison et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci
10 USA 99(3):1443-8. (2002).
                The term "hairpin"refers to a looping RNA structure of 7-20 nucleotides. A "short hairpin
   RNA" or shRNA is a single stranded RNA 10 to 50 nucleotides in length characertized by a hairpin
   turn which reduces expression of a target gene, wherein portions of the RNA strand are sufficiently
   complementary (e.g., having at least 80% identity to the target gene). The term "stem-loop" refers to
15 a pairing between two regions of the same molecule base-pair to form a double helix that ends in a
   short unpaired loop, giving a lollipop-shaped structure.
                A "micro RNA" or "miRNA" (previously known as stRNA) is a single stranded RNA of about
    10 to 70 nucleotides in length that are initially transcribed as pre-miRNA characterized by a "stem
   loop" structure, which are subsequently processed into mature miRNA after further processing
20 through the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).
                A "BNCA interferingRNA" or "BNCA RNAi" binds, preferably specifically, to a BNCA nucleic
   acid and reduces its expression.             This means the expression of the B7 negative costimulatory
   molecule molecule is lower with the BNCA RNAi present as compared to expression of the B7
   negative costimulatory molecule in a control where the BNCA RNAi is not present. BNCA RNAi
25 may be identified and synthesized using known methods (Shi Y., Trends in Genetics 19(1): 9-12
   (2003), W02003056012, W02003064621, W02001/075164, W02002/044321.
                A "BNCA oligopeptide" is an oligopeptide that binds, preferably specifically, to a B7
   negative         costimulatory     polypeptide,  including   a receptor,  ligand or signaling   component,
   respectively, as described herein. Such oligopeptides may be chemically synthesized using known
30 oligopeptide synthesis methodology or may be prepared and purified using recombinant technology.
   Such oligopeptides are usually at least about 5 amino acids in length, alternatively at least about 6, 7,
   8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,

                A "BNCA small molecule antagonist" or "BNCA small molecule" is an organic molecule
   other than an oligopeptide or antibody as defined herein that inhibits, preferably specifically, a B7
   negative costimulatory polypeptide. Such B7 negative co-stimulatory signaling inhibition preferably
15 renders an dysfunctional T-cell responsive to antigen stimulation. Example BNCA small molecules
   may be identified and chemically synthesized using known methodology (see, e.g., PCT Publication
   Nos. W02000/00823 and W02000/39585). Such BNCA small molecules are usually less than about
   2000 daltons in size, alternatively less than about 1500, 750, 500, 250 or 200 daltons in size, are
   capable of binding, preferably specifically, to a B7 negative stimulatory polypeptide as described
20 herein, and may be identified without undue experimentation using well known techniques. In this
   regard, it is noted that techniques for screening organic molecule libraries for molecules that are
   capable of binding to a polypeptide target are well known in the art (see, e.g., PCT Publication Nos.
   WOOO/00823 and WOOO/39585).
                The term "antibiotic" includes any molecule that specifically inhibits or abolishes the growth
25 of micro-organisms, such as virus, bacteria, fungi or protozoa, but is non-lethal to the host at the
   concentration and dosing interval administered. As used herein, the term antibiotic includes anti
   bacterial agent, anti-viral, agent, anti-fungal agent and anti-protozoan agent. In a specific aspect, an
   antibiotic is non-toxic to the host at the administered concentration and dosing intervals. Anti
   bacterial antibiotics or anti-bacterialscan be broadly classified as either bactericidal (i.e., directly
30 kills) or bacteriostatic (i.e., prevents division).        Anti-bactericidal antibiotics can be further
   subclassified as narrow-spectrum (i.e., only affects a small class of subset of bacteria, e.g., gram
   negative, etc.) or broad-spectrum (i.e., affects a broad class). Examples of antibiotics include: (i)

                The term "vaccine" as used herein includes any nonpathogenic immunogen that, when
   inoculated into a host, induces protective immunity against a specific pathogen. Vaccines can take
   many forms. Vaccines can be whole organisms that share important antigens with the pathogem, but
20 are not pathogenic themselves (e.g., cowpox). Vaccines can also be prepared from killed (e.g., Salk
   polio vaccine) or attenuated (lost ability to produce disease - e.g., Sabin polio vaccine). Vaccines
   can also be prepared from purified macromolecules isolated from the pathogenic organism.                         For
   example, toxoid vaccines (e.g., tetanus and diphtheria) containing the inactive form of soluble
   bacterial toxin - resulting in the production of anti-toxin antibodies, but not immunity to the intact
25 bacteria. Subunit vaccines (e.g., Hepatitis B) contain only a single immunogenic protein isolated
   from the pathogen of interest.                    Hapten conjugate vaccines attaches certain carbohydrate or
   polypeptide epitopes isolated from the pathogen of interest to immunogenic carriers, such as tetanus
   toxoid. These strategies essentially use the epitopes as haptens to induce antibody production, which
   then recognize the same epitope in the native pathogen. However, to be maximally effective, such
30 vaccines must incorporate both B- and T-cell cell epitopes, and the T-cell epitopes must be chosen to
   ensure that they can be recognized, presented and responded to by the immune systems of the host
   individuals.
                DNA vaccines exploit the ability of host cells to take up and express DNA encoding
   pathogenic proteins that is injected intramuscularly.
                                                                  38

                Examples of anti-viral vaccines that can be used in combination with the anti-PD-Li
   antibodies for the the methods described herein include: HCV vaccine (virasome) by Pevion
   Biotech., TG4040 (MVA-HCV by Transgene viron designed to enhance cellular (Cytotoxic T
   lymphocytes CD4+ and CD8+) immune response against NS3, NS4 and NS5B, CHRONVAC - a
 5 codon-optimized NS3/4a DNA vaccine by Inovio Biomedical, HCV/CpG vaccines by Novartis, GI
   5005 - an HCV vaccine by Globeimmune, IC41 a mixture of synthetic peptides having HCV CD4
   and CD8 T epitopes in combination with poly-L-arginine by Intercell.
                Host responses to immunogens can be enhanced if administered as a mixture with adjuvants.
   Immune adjuvants function in one or more of the following ways: (1) prolonging retention of the
10 immunogen, (2) increased effective size of the immunogen (and hence promoting phagocytosis and
   presentation to macrophages), (3) stimulating the influx of macrophage or other immune cells to the
   injection site, or (4) promoting local cytokine production and other immunologic activities. Example
   adjuvants include: complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), aluminum salts, and mycobacterial derived
   proteins such as muramyl di- or tri-peptides.
15               The term "antibody" includes monoclonal antibodies (including full length antibodies which
   have an            immunoglobulin         Fc region),    antibody   compositions with polyepitopic       specificity,
   multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies, diabodies, and single-chain molecules, as well as
   antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, F(ab') 2, and Fv).                     The term "immunoglobulin" (Ig) is used
   interchangeably with "antibody" herein.
20              The basic 4-chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical
   light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. An IgM antibody consists of 5 of the basic
   heterotetramer units along with an additional polypeptide called a J chain, and contains 10 antigen
   binding sites, while IgA antibodies comprise from 2-5 of the basic 4-chain units which can
   polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages in combination with the J chain. In the case of IgGs, the
25 4-chain unit is generally about 150,000 daltons. Each L chain is linked to an H chain by one covalent
   disulfide bond, while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds
   depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide
   bridges.        Each H chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain              (VH)  followed by three constant
   domains        (CH)      for each of the a and y chains and four   CH   domains for pt and 8 isotypes. Each L chain
30 has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (VL) followed by a constant domain at its other end. The VL
   is aligned with the              VH and the CL is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain   (CHI).
   Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy
   chain variable domains. The pairing of a VH and VL together forms a single antigen-binding site. For
   the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies, see e.g., Basic and Clinical
35 Immunology, 8th Edition, Daniel P. Sties, Abba 1. Terr and Tristram G. Parsolw (eds), Appleton &
                                                                  39

   Lange, Norwalk, CT, 1994, page 71 and Chapter 6. The L chain from any vertebrate species can be
   assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa and lambda, based on the amino acid
   sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain
   of their heavy chains (CH), immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There
 5 are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, having heavy chains designated a,
   6, 8, y and pt, respectively.      The y and a classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of
   relatively minor differences in the CH sequence and function, e.g., humans express the following
   subclasses: IgGI, IgG2A, IgG2B, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2.
                An "isolated" antibody is one that has been identified, separated and/or recovered from a
10 component of its production environment (E.g., natural or recombinant).            Preferably, the isolated
   polypeptide is free of association with all other components from its production environment.
   Contaminant components of its production environment, such as that resulting from recombinant
   transfected cells, are materials that would typically interfere with research, diagnostic or therapeutic
   uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non
15 proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified: (1) to greater than
   95% by weight of antibody as determined by, for example, the Lowry method, and in some
   embodiments, to greater than 99% by weight; (1) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues
   of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to
   homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or,
20 preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since
   at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present.               Ordinarily,
   however, an isolated polypeptide or antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.
                The "variable region" or "variable domain" of an antibody refers to the amino-terminal
   domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domains of the heavy chain and
25 light chain may be referred to as "VH" and "VL", respectively.           These domains are generally the
   most variable parts of the antibody (relative to other antibodies of the same class) and contain the
   antigen binding sites.
                The term "variable"refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains differ
   extensively in sequence among antibodies. The V domain mediates antigen binding and defines the
30 specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly
   distributed across the entire span of the variable domains.           Instead, it is concentrated in three
   segments called hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the light-chain and the heavy chain variable
   domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions
   (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely
35 adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three HVRs, which form loops connecting, and in
                                                         40
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in
   close proximity by the FR regions and, with the HVRs from the other chain, contribute to the
   formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., Sequences of Immunological
   Interest, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991)). The constant domains are
 5 not involved directly in the binding of antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions,
   such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.
                The term "monoclonal antibody " as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a
   population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the
   population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations and/or post-translation
10 modifications (e.g., isomerizations, amidations) that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal
   antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. In contrast to polyclonal
   antibody preparations which typically include                   different antibodies directed against different
   determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the
   antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are
15 synthesized by the hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins.                    The modifier
   "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially
   homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the
   antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance
   with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including, for example, the
20 hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler and Milstein., Nature, 256:495-97 (1975); Hongo et al., Hybridoma,
    14 (3): 253-260 (1995), Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor

                The term "naked antibody" refers to an antibody that is not conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety
   or radiolabel.
 5               The terms            "full-length antibody," "intact antibody" or "whole antibody" are used
   interchangeably to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form, as opposed to an antibody
   fragment. Specifically whole antibodies include those with heavy and light chains including an Fc
   region.         The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g., human native
   sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variants thereof                     In some cases, the intact
10 antibody may have one or more effector functions.
                An "antibody fragment" comprises a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the antigen
   binding and/or the variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include
   Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2 and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies (see U.S. Patent 5,641,870, Example
   2; Zapata et al., Protein Eng. 8(10): 1057-1062 [1995]); single-chain antibody molecules and
15 multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Papain digestion of antibodies produced
   two identical antigen-binding fragments, called "Fab" fragments, and a residual "Fc" fragment, a
   designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily.           The Fab fragment consists of an entire L
   chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain             (VH), and the first constant domain of one
   heavy chain            (CHI).      Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a
20 single antigen-binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F(ab') 2 fragment
   which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having different antigen-binding
   activity and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by
   having a few additional residues at the carboxy terminus of the              CHI  domain including one or more
   cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which the
25 cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group.                  F(ab') 2 antibody fragments
   originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other
   chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.
                 The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy-terminal portions of both H chains held together by
   disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in the Fc region, the
30 region which is also recognized by Fc receptors (FcR) found on certain types of cells.
                 "Fv" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and
   binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable region
   domain in tight, non-covalent association.                 From the folding of these two domains emanate six
   hypervariable loops (3 loops each from the H and L chain) that contribute the amino acid residues for
35 antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody.                  However, even a single
                                                                 42

   variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen) has the ability
   to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.
                 "Single-chain Fv " also abbreviated as "sFv " or "scFv " are antibody fragments that comprise
   the   VH      and VL antibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the sFv
 5 polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the            VH and VL domains which enables the
   sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of the sFv, see Pluckthun in The
   Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag,
   New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).
                 "Functionalfragments" of the antibodies of the invention comprise a portion of an intact
10 antibody, generally including the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody or the Fc
   region of an antibody which retains or has modified FcR binding capability. Examples of antibody
   fragments include linear antibody, single-chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies
   formed from antibody fragments.
                The term "diabodies" refers to small antibody fragments prepared by constructing sFv
15 fragments (see preceding paragraph) with short linkers (about 5-10) residues) between the          VH  and VL
   domains such that inter-chain but not intra-chain pairing of the V domains is achieved, thereby
   resulting in a bivalent fragment, i.e., a fragment having two antigen-binding sites.               Bispecific
   diabodies are heterodimers of two "crossover" sFv fragments in which the             VH and VL domains of the
   two antibodies are present on different polypeptide chains. Diabodies are described in greater detail
20 in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444
   6448 (1993).
                The          monoclonal   antibodies  herein    specifically    include   "chimeric"  antibodies
   (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous
   to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a
25 particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is(are) identical with or
   homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to
   another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the
   desired biological activity (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,
   81:6851-6855 (1984)).              Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include PRIMATIZED antibodies
30 wherein the antigen-binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by, e.g.,
   immunizing macaque monkeys with an antigen of interest. As used herein, "humanized antibody" is
   used a subset of "chimeric antibodies."
                 "Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that
   contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin.                       In one embodiment, a
35 humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin (recipient antibody) in which residues from an HVR
                                                             43

   (hereinafter defined) of the recipient are replaced by residues from an HVR of a non-human species
   (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non-human primate having the desired specificity,
   affinity, and/or capacity.               In some instances,    framework    ("FR") residues     of the  human
   immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues.                      Furthermore, humanized
 5 antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor
   antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody performance, such as binding
   affinity.        In general, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and
   typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops
   correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin sequence, and all or substantially all of the FR
10 regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence, although the FR regions may include one or
   more individual FR residue substitutions that improve antibody performance, such as binding
   affinity, isomerization, immunogenicity, etc. The number of these amino acid substitutions in the FR
   are typically no more than 6 in the H chain, and in the L chain, no more than 3.                The humanized
   antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc),
15 typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see, e.g., Jones et al., Nature 321:522
   525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593

20              A "human antibody" is an antibody that possesses an amino-acid sequence corresponding to
   that of an antibody produced by a human and/or has been made using any of the techniques for
   making human antibodies as disclosed herein.                This definition of a human antibody specifically
   excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues. Human antibodies
   can be produced using various techniques known in the art, including phage-display libraries.

   Also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies are methods described in Cole et
   al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985); Boerner et al., J.
   Immunol., 147(1):86-95 (1991).              See also van Dijk and van de Winkel, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol., 5:
   368-74 (2001).                Human antibodies can be prepared by administering the antigen to a transgenic
30 animal that has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge, but
   whose endogenous loci have been disabled, e.g., immunized xenomice (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos.
   6,075,181 and 6,150,584 regarding XENOMOUSETM technology).                     See also, for example, Li et al.,
   Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,               103:3557-3562 (2006) regarding human antibodies generated via a
   human B-cell hybridoma technology.
35              The term "hypervariable region," "HVR," or "HV," when used herein refers to the regions of
                                                             44

   an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or form structurally defined
   loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in the VH (HI, H2, H3), and three in the VL
   (LI, L2, L3). In native antibodies, H3 and L3 display the most diversity of the six HVRs, and H3 in
   particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring fine specificity to antibodies. See, e.g., Xu
 5 et al., Immunity 13:37-45 (2000); Johnson and Wu, in Methods in Molecular Biology 248:1-25 (Lo,
   ed., Human Press, Totowa, NJ, 2003). Indeed, naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a
   heavy chain only are functional and stable in the absence of light chain.            See, e.g., Hamers
   Casterman et al., Nature 363:446-448 (1993); Sheriff et al., Nature Struct. Biol. 3:733-736 (1996).
                A number of HVR delineations are in use and are encompassed herein.             The Kabat
10 Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are based on sequence variability and are the most
   commonly used (Kabat et al., Sequences ofProteinsofImmunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health
   Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991)).    Chothia refers instead to the location
   of the structural loops (Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)).          The AbM HVRs
   represent a compromise between the Kabat HVRs and Chothia structural loops, and are used by
15 Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling software. The "contact" HVRs are based on an analysis
   of the available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these HVRs are noted below.

                 HVRs may comprise "extended HVRs" as follows: 24-36 or 24-34 (L1), 46-56 or 50-56 (L2)
30 and 89-97 or 89-96 (L3) in the VL and 26-35 (HI), 50-65 or 49-65 (H2) and 93-102, 94-102, or 95
    102 (H3) in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al., supra, for
   each of these definitions.
                 The expression "variable-domain residue-numbering as in Kabat" or "amino-acid-position
   numbering as in Kabat," and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used for heavy-chain
35 variable domains or light-chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al.,
   supra. Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or
   additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or HVR of the
                                                       45
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   variable domain. For example, a heavy-chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert
   (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b,
   and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy-chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues
   may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the
 5 antibody with a "standard" Kabat numbered sequence.
                 "Framework" or "FR" residues are those variable-domain residues other than the HVR
   residues as herein defined.
                A "human consensus framework" or "acceptor human framework" is a framework that
   represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residues in a selection of human
10 immunoglobulin VL                  or VH framework sequences.        Generally, the selection of human
   immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally,
   the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological
   Interest,       5t1     Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991).
   Examples include for the VL, the subgroup may be subgroup kappa I, kappa II, kappa III or kappa IV
15 as in Kabat et al., supra. Additionally, for the VH, the subgroup may be subgroup I, subgroup II, or
   subgroup III as in Kabat et al., supra. Alternatively, a human consensus framework can be derived
   from the above in which particular residues, such as when a human framework residue is selected
   based on its homology to the donor framework by aligning the donor framework sequence with a
   collection of various human framework sequences. An acceptor human framework "derived from" a
20 human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework may comprise the same amino
   acid sequence thereof, or it may contain pre-existing amino acid sequence changes.              In some
   embodiments, the number of pre-existing amino acid changes are 10 or less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or
   less, 6 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less.
                A "VH subgroup III consensusframework" comprises the consensus sequence obtained from
25 the amino acid sequences in variable heavy subgroup III of Kabat et al., supra. In one embodiment,
   the VH subgroup III consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of
   each of the following sequences: EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAAS (HC-FR1)(SEQ ID NO:4),
   WVRQAPGKGLEWV                               (HC-FR2),              (SEQ             ID            NO:5),

   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

                A "VL kappa I consensus framework" comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the
   amino acid sequences in variable light kappa subgroup I of Kabat et al., supra. In one embodiment,
   the VH subgroup I consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of
   each of the following sequences:       DIQMTQSPSSLSASVGDRVTITC (LC-FR1) (SEQ ID NO: 11),

   (LC-FR4)(SEQ ID NO:14).
                An "amino-acid modification" at a specified position, e.g. of the Fc region, refers to the
   substitution or deletion of the specified residue, or the insertion of at least one amino acid residue
10 adjacent the specified residue. Insertion "adjacent" to a specified residue means insertion within one
   to two residues thereof. The insertion may be N-terminal or C-terminal to the specified residue. The
   preferred amino acid modification herein is a substitution.
                An "affinity-matured" antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more HVRs
   thereof that result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent
15 antibody that does not possess those alteration(s). In one embodiment, an affinity-matured antibody
   has nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity-matured antibodies are
   produced by procedures known in the art. For example, Marks et al., Bio/Technology 10:779-783
   (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH- and VL-domain shuffling.               Random mutagenesis of
   HVR and/or framework residues is described by, for example: Barbas et al. ProcNat. Acad. Sci. USA
20 91:3809-3813 (1994); Schier et al. Gene 169:147-155 (1995); Yelton et al. J. Immunol. 155:1994
   2004 (1995); Jackson et al., J. Immunol. 154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins et al, J. Mol. Biol.
   226:889-896 (1992).
                As use herein, the term "specifically binds to" or is "specific for" refers to measurable and
   reproducible interactions such as binding between a target and an antibody, which is determinative of
25 the presence of the target in the presence of a heterogeneous population of molecules including
   biological molecules. For example, an antibody that specifically binds to a target (which can be an
   epitope) is an antibody that binds this target with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with
   greater duration than it binds to other targets.       In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an
   antibody to an unrelated target is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to the target as
30 measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that specifically
   binds to a target has a dissociation constant (Kd) of < 1 M, < 100 nM, < 10 nM, < 1 nM, or < 0. 1
   nM.        In certain embodiments, an antibody specifically binds to an epitope on a protein that is
   conserved among the protein from different species. In another embodiment, specific binding can
   include, but does not require exclusive binding.
                                                         47
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

                A "blocking" antibody or an "antagonist" antibody is one that inhibits or reduces a biological
   activity of the antigen it binds. In some embodiments, blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies
   substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen. The anti-PD-Li antibodies
   of the invention block the signaling through PD-I so as to restore a functional response by T-cells
 5 from a dysfunctional state to antigen stimulation.
                An "agonist" or activating antibody is one that enhances or initiates signaling by the antigen
   to which it binds. In some embodiments, agonist antibodies cause or activate signaling without the
   presence of the natural ligand.
                The term "solidphase"describes a non-aqueous matrix to which the antibody of the present
10 invention can adhere. Examples of solid phases encompassed herein include those formed partially
   or entirely of glass (e.g., controlled pore glass), polysaccharides (e.g., agarose), polyacrylamides,
   polystyrene, polyvinyl alcohol and silicones. In certain embodiments, depending on the context, the
   solid phase can comprise the well of an assay plate; in others it is a purification column (e.g., an
   affinity chromatography colunm). This term also includes a discontinuous solid phase of discrete
15 particles, such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,275,149.
                 "Antibody effector functions" refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region
   (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody, and vary with
   the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include: Ci q binding and complement
   dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody -               dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
20 (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g., B cell receptors); and B cell
   activation. "Reduced or minimized" antibody effector function means that which is reduced by at
   least 50% (alternatively 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%) from
   the wild type or unmodified antibody. The determination of antibody effector effector function is
   readily determinable and measurable by one of ordinary skill in the art. In a preferred embodiment,
25 the antibody effector functions of complement binding, complement dependent cytotoxicity and
   antibody dependent cytotoxicity are affected.            In some embodiments of the invention, effector
   function is eliminated through a mutation in the constant region that eliminated glycosylation, e.g.,
   "effector-less mutation." In one aspect, the effector-less mutation is an N297A or DANA mutation
   (D265A + N297A) in the CH2 region. Shields et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276 (9): 6591-6604 (2001).
30 Alternatively, additional mutations resulting in reduced or eliminated effector function include:
   K322A and L234A/L235A (LALA). Alternatively, effector function can be reduced or eliminated
   through production techniques, such as expression in host cells that do not glycosylate (e.g., E. coli.)
   or in which result in an altered glycolsylation pattern that is ineffective or less effective at promoting
   effector function (e.g., Shinkawa et al., J. Biol. Chem. 278(5): 3466-3473 (2003).
                                                           48
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

                 "Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity" or ADCC refers to a form of cytotoxicity in
   which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors (FcRs) present on certain cytotoxic cells (e.g., natural
   killer (NK) cells, neutrophils and macrophages) enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind
   specifically to an antigen-bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins.
 5 The antibodies "arm" the cytotoxic cells and are required for killing of the target cell by this
   mechanism.               The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcyRIII only, whereas
   monocytes express FcyRI, FcyRII and FcyRIII. Fc expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized
   in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9: 457-92 (1991).               To assess
   ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S.
10 Patent No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and natural killer (NK) cells.                 Alternatively, or
   additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in an animal
   model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al., PNAS USA 95:652-656 (1998).
                 Unless indicated otherwise herein, the numbering of the residues in an immunoglobulin
15 heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al., supra. The "EU index as in Kabat" refers to
   the residue numbering of the human IgGI EU antibody.
                 The term "Fc region" herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin
   heavy chain, including native-sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. Although the boundaries
   of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy-chain Fc region
20 is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the
   carboxyl-terminus thereof.            The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering
   system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during production or purification of the
   antibody, or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody.
   Accordingly, a composition of intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447
25 residues removed, antibody populations with no K447 residues removed, and antibody populations
   having a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue.             Suitable native-sequence Fc
   regions for use in the antibodies of the invention include human IgG1, IgG2 (IgG2A, IgG2B), IgG3
   and IgG4.
                 "Fc receptor" or "FcR" describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The
30 preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an
   IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcyRI, FcyRII, and FcyRIII
   subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors, FcyRII
   receptors include FcyRIIA (an "activating receptor") and FcyRIIB (an "inhibiting receptor"), which
   have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof.
35 Activating receptor FcyRIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in
                                                            49
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   its cytoplasmic domain.              Inhibiting receptor FcyRIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
   inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. (see M. Dacron, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15:203-234
   (1997).        FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9: 457-92 (1991); Capel et
   al., Immunomethods 4: 25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med. 126: 330-41 (1995).
 5 Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term "FcR" herein.
                The term "Fc receptor" or "FcR" also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is
   responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus. Guyer et al., J. Immunol. 117: 587 (1976)
   and Kim et al., J. Immunol. 24: 249 (1994). Methods of measuring binding to FcRn are known (see,
   e.g., Ghetie and Ward, Immunol. Today 18: (12): 592-8 (1997); Ghetie et al., Nature Biotechnology
10  15 (7): 637-40 (1997); Hinton et al., J. Biol. Chem. 279 (8): 6213-6 (2004); WO 2004/92219 (Hinton
   et al.).         Binding to FcRn in vivo and serum half-life of human FcRn high-affinity binding
   polypeptides can be assayed, e.g., in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing
   human FcRn, or in primates to which the polypeptides having a variant Fc region are administered.
   WO 2004/42072 (Presta) describes antibody variants which improved or diminished binding to FcRs.
15 See also, e.g., Shields et al., J. Biol. Chem. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001).
                 "Effector cells" are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector
   functions.          In one aspect, the effector cells express at least FcyRIII and perform ADCC effector
   function.            Examples      of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils.
20 The effector cells may be isolated from a native source, e.g., blood.           Effector cells generally are
   lymphocytes associated with the effector phase, and function to produce cytokines (helper T cells),
   killing cells in infected with pathogens (cytotoxic T cells) or secreting antibodies (differentiated B
   cells).
                 "Complement dependent cytotoxicity" or "CDC" refers to the lysis of a target cell in the
25 presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding
   of the first component of the complement system (Clq) to antibodies (of the appropriate subclass)
   which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g., as
   described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol. Methods 202: 163 (1996), may be performed.
   Antibody variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased Clq
30 binding capability are described in US patent No. 6,194,551B1 and WO99/51642.               The contents of
   those patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, Idusogie et al.

                The N-glycosylation site in IgG is at Asn297 in the CH2 domain. The present invention also
   provides compositions of an antigen-binding, humanized antibody having an Fc region with reduced
35 or no effector function. One manner in which this can be accomplished is an A297N substitution,
                                                              50

   which has previously been shown to abolish complement binding and effector function ("effector-less
   Fc mutant") in an anti-CD20 antibody.                 Idusgie et al., supra. As a result of this mutation, the
   production of anti-PD-Li antibodies of the present inventions containing this Fc mutation in
   mammalian cells such as CHO will not have any glycosylation and, which in turn results in reduced
 5 or minimal effector function. Alternatively, antibody effector function may be eliminated without
   CH2 substitution by expression in non-mammalian cells such as E. Coli.
                 "Binding affinity" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of non-covalent
   interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner
   (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, "binding affinity" refers to intrinsic
10 binding affinity that reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and
   antigen).          The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the
   dissociation constant (Kd).              Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art,
   including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to
   dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain
15 bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which
   can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative and exemplary embodiments
   for measuring binding affinity are described in the following.
                 The "Kd" or "Kd value" according to this invention is in one embodiment measured by a
   radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of the antibody and antigen
20 molecule as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for
   antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of ( 12 5 1)-labeled antigen in the presence of
   a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated
   plate (Chen, et al., (1999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-88 1). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter
   plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 ug/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in
25 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin
   in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23'C). In a non-adsorbant plate
   (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [ 12 51]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest
   (consistent with assessement of an anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., (1997) Cancer Res.
   57:4593-4599).                 The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may
30 continue for a longer period (e.g., 65 hours) to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the
   mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature for one hour. The
   solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. When the
   plates have dried, 150 ul/well of scintillant (MicroScint-20; Packard) is added, and the plates are
   counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that
35 give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.
                                                                51

                According to another embodiment, the Kd is measured by using surface-plasmon resonance
   assays using a BIACORE*-2000 or a BIACORE-3000 instrument (BlAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at
   25'C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at -10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated
   dextran          biosensor           chips  (CM5,     BlAcore      Inc.)    are   activated    with   N-ethyl-N'-    (3
 5 dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide                  hydrochloride       (EDC)     and   N-hydroxysuccinimide       (NHS)
   according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5
   gg/ml (-0.2 [M) before injection at a flow rate of 5 gL/minute to achieve approximately 10 response
   units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to
   block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500
10 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% TWEEN                       2 0  TM  surfactant (PBST) at 25'C at a flow rate of
   approximately 25 gL/min. Association rates (kon) and dissociation rates (koff) are calculated using a
   simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by
   simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams.                      The equilibrium dissociation
   constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio kcff/kon.               See, e.g., Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881

15 (1999). If the on-rate exceeds 10 M s- by the surface-plasmon resonance assay above, then the on
   rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or
   decrease in fluorescence-emission intensity (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm band
   pass) at 25 0 C of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of
   increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow-equipped
20 spectrophotometer                  (Aviv Instruments)   or a 8000-series        SLM-AMINCOTM         spectrophotometer
   (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.
                An "on-rate," "rate of association," "association rate," or "kon" according to this invention
   can also be determined as described above using a BIACORE-2000 or a BIACORE-3000 system
   (BlAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 25'C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at about 10 response
25 units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor ships (CM5, BlAcore Inc.) are activated
   with         N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylamino             propyl   )-carbodiimide        hydrochloride    (ECD)     and   N
   hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM
   sodium acetate, ph 4.8, into 5 mg/ml (~ 0.2 mM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. to
   achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein.                            Following the injection of
30 antigen, IM ethanolamine is added to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold
   serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at
   25'C at a flow rate of approximately 25ul/min. Association rates (kon) and dissociation rates (koff)
   are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BlAcore Evaluation Software
   version 3.2) by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium
35 dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio kcff/kon.                  See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al., (1999) J.
                                                                  52

   Mol Biol 293:865-881.              However, if the on-rate exceeds 106 M- 1 S-1 by  the surface plasmon
   resonance assay above, then the on-rate is preferably determined by using a fluorescent quenching
   technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation = 295
   nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25 0 C of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in
 5 PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a a spectrometer,
   such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco
   spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.
                The phrase "substantially reduced," or "substantially different," as used herein, denotes a
   sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values (generally one associated with a
10 molecule and the other associated with a reference/comparator molecule) such that one of skill in the
   art would consider the difference between the two values to be of statistical significance within the
   context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference
   between said two values is, for example, greater than about 10%, greater than about 20%, greater
   than about 30%, greater than about 40%, and/or greater than about 50% as a function of the value for
15 the reference/comparator molecule.
                 The term "substantially similar" or "substantially the same," as used herein, denotes a
   sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (for example, one associated with
   an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference/comparator antibody), such
   that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no
20 biological and/or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured
   by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is, for example, less than
   about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, and/or less than about
    10% as a function of the reference/comparator value.
                 "Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity" and "homology" with respect to a peptide,
25 polypeptide or antibody sequence are defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate
   sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the specific peptide or polypeptide
   sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum
   percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence
   identity.         Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be
30 achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available
   computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or MEGALIGNTM (DNASTAR) software.
   Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any
   algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being
   compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are generated using
35 the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2, authored by Genentech, Inc. The source code
                                                           53

   of ALIGN-2 has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C.,
   20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087.                 The ALIGN-2
   program is publicly available through Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California.                  The
   ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX
 5 V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.
                In situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the %
   amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino
   acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or
   comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence
10 B) is calculated as follows:
                                               100 times the fraction X/Y
   where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment
   program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino
   acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal
15 to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal
   the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A.
                 Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid sequence identity values used herein
   are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN-2 computer
   program.
20              An "isolated" nucleic acid molecule encoding the antibodies herein is a nucleic acid
   molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with
   which it is ordinarily associated in the environment in which it was produced.                Preferably, the
   isolated nucleic acid is free of association with all components associated with the production
   environment. The isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding the polypeptides and antibodies herein is
25 in a form other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature.            Isolated nucleic acid
   molecules therefore are distinguished from nucleic acid encoding the polypeptides and antibodies
   herein existing naturally in cells.
                The term "control sequences" refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an
   operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism.             The control sequences that are
30 suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a
   ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and
   enhancers.
                Nucleic acid is "operably linked" when it is placed into a functional relationship with another
   nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to
35 DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the
                                                           54
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the
   transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it
   is positioned so as to facilitate translation.               Generally, "operably linked" means that the DNA
   sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in
 5 reading phase.               However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous.        Linking is accomplished by
   ligation at convenient restriction sites.              If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide
   adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.
                 The term "epitope tagged" when used herein refers to a chimeric polypeptide comprising a
   polypeptide or antibody described herein fused to a "tag polypeptide".                   The tag polypeptide has
10 enough residues to provide an epitope against which an antibody can be made, yet is short enough
   such that it does not interfere with activity of the polypeptide to which it is fused.                   The tag
   polypeptide preferably also is fairly unique so that the antibody does not substantially cross-react
   with other epitopes.               Suitable tag polypeptides generally have at least six amino acid residues and
   usually between about 8 and 50 amino acid residues (preferably, between about 10 and 20 amino acid
15 residues).
                As used herein, the term "immunoadhesin" designates antibody-like molecules which
   combine the binding specificity of a heterologous protein (an "adhesion") with the effector functions
   of immunoglobulin constant domains.                   Structurally, the immunoadhesins comprise a fusion of an
   amino acid sequence with the desired binding specificity which is other than the antigen recognition
20 and binding site of an antibody (i.e., is "heterologous"), and an immunoglobulin constant domain
   sequence.           The adhesin part of an immunoadhesin molecule typically is a contiguous amino acid
   sequence comprising at least the binding site of a receptor or a ligand. The immunoglobulin constant
   domain sequence in the immunoadhesin may be obtained from any immunoglobulin, such as IgG-1,
   IgG-2 (including IgG2A and IgG2B), IgG-3, or IgG-4 subtypes, IgA (including IgA-1 and IgA-2),
25 IgE, IgD or IgM. The Ig fusions preferably include the substitution of a domain of a polypeptide or
   antibody described herein in the place of at least one variable region within an Ig molecule. In a
   particularly preferred embodiment, the immunoglobulin fusion includes the hinge, CH2 and CH3, or
   the hinge, CHI, CH2 and CH3 regions of an IgGI molecule. For the production of immunoglobulin
   fusions see              also US Patent No. 5,428,130           issued June 27,   1995.    For example, useful
30 immunoadhesins as second medicaments useful for combination therapy herein include polypeptides
   that comprise the extracellular or PD-I binding portions of PD-LI or PD-L2, or vice versa, fused to a
   constant domain of an immunoglobulin sequence.
                A "fusion protein" and a "fusion polypeptide" refer to a polypeptide having two portions
   covalently linked together, where each of the portions is a polypeptide having a different properly.
35 The property may be a biological property, such as activity in vitro or in vivo. The property may also
                                                                  55
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   be simple chemical or physical property, such as binding to a target molecule, catalysis of a reaction,
   etc. The two portions may be linked directly by a single peptide bond or through a peptide linker will
   be in reading frame with each other.
                A "stable" formulation is one in which the protein therein essentially retains its physical and
 5 chemical stability and integrity upon storage. Various analytical techniques for measuring protein
   stability are available in the art and are reviewed in Peptide and Protein Drug Delivery, 247-301,
   Vincent Lee Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, New York, Pubs. (1991) and Jones, A. Adv. Drug
   Delivery Rev. 10: 29-90 (1993).          Stability can be measured at a selected temperature for a selected
   time period. For rapid screening, the formulation may be kept at 40'C for 2 weeks to 1 month, at
10 which time stability is measured.          Where the formulation is to be stored at 2-8'C, generally the
   formulation should be stable at 30'C or 40'C for at least 1 month and/or stable at 2-8'C for at least 2
   years. Where the formulation is to be stored at 30'C, generally the formulation should be stable for
   at least 2 years at 30'C and/or stable at 40'C for at least 6 months.           For example, the extent of
   aggregation during storage can be used as an indicator of protein stability.              Thus, a "stable"
15 formulation may be one wherein less than about 10% and preferably less than about 5% of the
   protein are present as an aggregate in the formulation.           In other embodiments, any increase in
   aggregate formation during storage of the formulation can be determined.
                A "reconstituted" formulation is one which has been prepared by dissolving a lyophilized
   protein or antibody formulation in a diluent such that the protein is dispersed throughout.              The
20 reconstituted formulation is suitable for administration (e.g. subscutaneous administration) to a
   patient to be treated with the protein of interest and, in certain embodiments of the invention, may be
   one which is suitable for parenteral or intravenous administration.
                An "isotonic" formulation is one which has essentially the same osmotic pressure as human
   blood. Isotonic formulations will generally have an osmotic pressure from about 250 to 350 mOsm.
25 The term "hypotonic" describes a formulation with an osmotic pressure below that of human blood.
   Correspondingly, the term "hypertonic" is used to describe a formulation with an osmotic pressure
   above that of human blood. Isotonicity can be measured using a vapor pressure or ice-freezing type
   osmometer, for example. The formulations of the present invention are hypertonic as a result of the
   addition of salt and/or buffer.
30               "Carriers" as used herein include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or
   stabilizers that are nontoxic to the cell or mammal being exposed thereto at the dosages and
   concentrations employed.           Often the physiologically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH buffered
   solution. Examples of physiologically acceptable carriers include buffers such as phosphate, citrate,
   and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about
35  10 residues) polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic
                                                           56

   polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine
   or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or
   dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming
   counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEENTM, polyethylene glycol
 5 (PEG), and PLURONICS TM.
                A "package insert" refers to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of
   medicaments that contain information about the indications customarily included in commercial
   packages           of medicaments          that   contain information     about the indications,    usage,    dosage,
   administration, contraindications, other medicaments to be combined with the packaged product,
10 and/or warnings concerning the use of such medicaments, etc.
                A "pharmaceuticallyacceptable acid" includes inorganic and organic acids which are non
   toxic at the concentration and manner in which they are formulated. For example, suitable inorganic
   acids include hydrochloric, perchloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric, sulfuric, sulfonic, sulfinic,
   sulfanilic, phosphoric, carbonic, etc.                Suitable organic acids include straight and branched-chain
15 alkyl, aromatic, cyclic, cycloaliphatic, arylaliphatic, heterocyclic, saturated, unsaturated, mono, di
   and tri-carboxylic,                including   for  example,   formic,   acetic,  2-hydroxyacetic,    trifluoroacetic,

   ethylpiperidine, polyamine resins and the like.                Particularly preferred organic non-toxic bases are
   isopropylamine,                diethylamine,  ethanolamine,    trimethamine,    dicyclohexylamine,   choline,   and
   caffeine. Additional pharmaceutically acceptable acids and bases useable with the present invention
   include those which are derived from the amino acids, for example, histidine, glycine, phenylalanine,
 5 aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine and asparagine.
                 "Pharmaceuticallyacceptable" buffers and salts include those derived from both acid and
   base addition salts of the above indicated acids and bases.                  Specific buffers and/ or salts include
   histidine, succinate and acetate.
                A "pharmaceuticallyacceptable sugar" is a molecule which, when combined with a protein
10 of interest, significantly prevents or reduces chemical and/or physical instability of the protein upon
   storage.             When the         formulation   is  intended   to be    lyophilized   and then reconstituted,
   "pharmaceutically acceptable sugars" may also be known as a "lyoprotectant".                     Exemplary sugars
   and their corresponding sugar alcohols include: an amino acid such as monosodium glutamate or
   histidine; a methylamine such as betaine; a lyotropic salt such as magnesium sulfate; a polyol such as
15 trihydric or higher molecular weight sugar alcohols, e.g. glycerin, dextran, erythritol, glycerol,
   arabitol, xylitol, sorbitol, and mannitol; propylene glycol; polyethylene glycol; PLURONICS; and
   combinations thereof. Additional exemplary lyoprotectants include glycerin and gelatin, and the
   sugars mellibiose, melezitose, raffinose, mannotriose and stachyose.                  Examples of reducing sugars
   include glucose, maltose, lactose, maltulose, iso-maltulose and lactulose. Examples of non-reducing
20 sugars include non-reducing glycosides of polyhydroxy compounds selected from sugar alcohols and
   other straight chain polyalcohols.                Preferred sugar alcohols are monoglycosides, especially those
   compounds obtained by reduction of disaccharides such as lactose, maltose, lactulose and maltulose.
   The glycosidic side group can be either glucosidic or galactosidic.                  Additional examples of sugar
   alcohols are glucitol, maltitol, lactitol and iso-maltulose. The preferred pharmaceutically-acceptable
25 sugars are the non-reducing sugars trehalose or sucrose.                   Pharmaceutically acceptable sugars are
   added to the formulation in a "protecting amount" (e.g. pre-lyophilization) which means that the
   protein essentially retains its physical and chemical stability and integrity during storage (e.g., after
   reconstitution and storage).
                 The "diluent" of interest herein is one which is pharmaceutically acceptable (safe and non
30 toxic for administration to a human) and is useful for the preparation of a liquid formulation, such as
   a formulation reconstituted after lyophilization.                    Exemplary diluents include      sterile water,
   bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), a pH buffered solution (e.g. phosphate-buffered saline),
   sterile saline solution, Ringer's solution or dextrose solution. In an alternative embodiment, diluents
   can include aqueous solutions of salts and/or buffers.
                                                                 58

                A "preservative"is a compound which can be added to the formulations herein to reduce
   bacterial activity. The addition of a preservative may, for example, facilitate the production of a
   multi-use            (multiple-dose) formulation.    Examples     of  potential   preservatives  include
   octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, hexamethonium chloride, benzalkonium chloride (a
 5 mixture of alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chlorides in which the alkyl groups are long-chain
   compounds), and benzethonium chloride. Other types of preservatives include aromatic alcohols
   such as phenol, butyl and benzyl alcohol, alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben, catechol,
   resorcinol, cyclohexanol, 3-pentanol, and m-cresol. The most preferred preservative herein is benzyl
   alcohol.
10               "Treatment" refers to clinical intervention designed to alter the natural course of the
   individual or cell being treated, and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of
   clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include preventing occurrence or recurrence of
   disease, preventing metastasis, decreasing the rate of disease progression, ameliorating or palliating
   the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments, antibodies of the
15 invention are used to delay development of a disease or disorder. A subject is successfully "treated",
   for example, using the apoptotic anti-PD-Li antibodies of the invention if one or more symptoms
   associated with a T-cell dysfunctional disorder is mitigated.
                An "effective amount" refers to at least an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of
   time necessary, to achieve the desired or indicated effect, including a therapeutic or prophylactic
20 result. For example, an effective amount of the anti-PD-Li antibodies of the present invention is at
   least the minimum concentration that results in inhibition of signaling from PD-Li, either through
   PD-I on T-cells or B7.1 on other APCs or both.
                A "therapeuticallyeffective amount" is at least the minimum concentration required to effect
   a measurable improvement or prevention of a particular disorder. A therapeutically effective amount
25 herein may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the patient, and
   the ability of the antibody to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective
   amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody are outweighed by the
   therapeutically beneficial effects. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of the anti-PD-Li
   antibodies of the present invention is at least the minimum concentration that results in inhibition of
30 at least one symptom of a T cell dysfunctional disorder.
                A "prophylacticallyeffective amount" refers to an amount effective, at the dosages and for
   periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. For example, a prophylactically
   effective amount of the anti-PD-Li antibodies of the present invention is at least the minimum
   concentration that prevents or attenuates the development of at least one symptom of a T cell
35 dysfunctional disorder.

                 "Chronic" administration refers to administration of the medicament(s) in a continuous as
   opposed to acute mode, so as to main the initial therapeutic effect (activity) for an extended period of
   time. "Intermittent" administration is treatment that is not consecutively done without interruption,
   but rather is cyclic in nature.
 5               "Mammal" for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including
   humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, rabbits,
   cattle, pigs, hamsters, gerbils, mice, ferrets, rats, cats, etc. Preferably, the mammal is human.
                 The term "pharmaceuticalformulation" refers to a preparation that is in such form as to
   permit the biological activity of the active ingredient to be effective, and that contains no additional
10 components that are unacceptably toxic to a subject to which the formulation would be administered.
   Such formulations are sterile.
                A "sterile" formulation is aseptic or free from all living microorganisms and their spores.
                 The term "about" as used herein refers to the usual error range for the respective value
   readily known to the skilled person in this technical field.
15               An "autoimmune disorder" is a disease or disorder arising from and directed against an
   individual's own tissues or organs or a co-segregation or manifestation thereof or resulting condition
   therefrom.            Autoimmune diseases can be an organ-specific disease (i.e., the immune response is
   specifically directed against an organ system such as the endocrine system, the hematopoietic system,
   the skin, the cardiopulmonary system, the gastrointestinal and liver systems, the renal system, the
20 thyroid, the ears, the neuromuscular system, the central nervous system, etc.) or a systemic disease
   that can affect multiple organ systems (for example, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid
   arthritis (RA), polymyositis, etc.).         Preferred such diseases include autoimmune rheumatologic
   disorders (such as, for example, RA, Sj6gren's syndrome, scleroderma, lupus such as SLE and lupus
   nephritis, polymyositis-dermatomyositis, cryoglobulinemia, anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome,
25 and psoriatic arthritis), autoimmune gastrointestinal and liver disorders (such as, for example,
   inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), autoimmune gastritis and

   associated vasculitis, including Churg-Strauss vasculitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and microscopic
30 polyangiitis), autoimmune neurological disorders (such as, for example, multiple sclerosis,
   opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, myasthenia gravis, neuromyelitis optica, Parkinson's disease,
   Alzheimer's disease, and autoimmune polyneuropathies), renal disorders (such as, for example,
   glomerulonephritis, Goodpasture's syndrome, and Berger's disease), autoimmune dermatologic
   disorders (such as, for example, psoriasis, urticaria, hives, pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid,
35 and cutaneous lupus erythematosus), hematologic disorders (such as, for example, thrombocytopenic

   anemia), atherosclerosis, uveitis, autoimmune hearing diseases (such as, for example, inner ear
   disease and hearing loss), Behcet's disease, Raynaud's syndrome, organ transplant, and autoimmune
   endocrine disorders (such as, for example, diabetic-related autoimmune diseases such as insulin
 5 dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), Addison's disease, and autoimmune thyroid disease (e.g.,
   Graves' disease and thyroiditis)). More preferred such diseases include, for example, RA, ulcerative
   colitis, ANCA-associated vasculitis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, Sj6gren's syndrome, Graves' disease,
   IDDM, pernicious anemia, thyroiditis, and glomerulonephritis.
                The term "cytotoxic agent" as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the
10 function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term includes radioactive isotopes (e.g. At2 11 ,
                     90
     31,    25, Y , Re 186 , Rel", Sm 153 , Bi 2 12 , p 32 and radioactive isotopes of Lu), and toxins such as
                                                                                                                         small
   molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, or
   fragments thereof.
                A "chemotherapeutic agent" is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer.

   any of the above.
30              A "growth-inhibitoryagent" refers to a compound or composition that inhibits growth of a
   cell, which growth depends on receptor activation either in vitro or in vivo. Thus, the growth
   inhibitory agent includes one that significantly reduces the percentage of receptor-dependent cells in
   S phase. Examples of growth-inhibitory agents include agents that block cell-cycle progression (at a
   place other than S phase), such as agents that induce GI arrest and M-phase arrest. Classical M
35 phase blockers include the vincas and vinca alkaloids (vincristine and vinblastine), taxanes, and

   Those agents that arrest GI also spill over into S-phase arrest, for example, DNA alkylating agents
   such as tamoxifen, prednisone, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, cisplatin, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil,
   and ara-C. Further information can be found in The Molecular Basis of Cancer, Mendelsohn and

   Murakami et al. (WB Saunders: Philadelphia, 1995), especially p. 13. The taxanes (paclitaxel and
   docetaxel) are anticancer drugs both derived from the yew tree. Docetaxel (TAXOTERE, Rhone

10               The term "cytokine" is a generic term for proteins released by one cell population that act on
   another cell as intercellular mediators. Examples of such cytokines are lymphokines, monokines;
   interleukins (ILs) such as IL-1, IL-la, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-11, IL-12, IL
    13, IL-15 ... IL-35, including PROLEUKIN rIL-2; a tumor-necrosis factor such as TNF-a or TNF
    3; and other polypeptide factors including LIF and kit ligand (KL), while the term "interleukin" has
15 now essentially become a synonym for cytokine. As used herein, the term cytokine includes proteins
   from natural sources or from recombinant cell culture and biologically active equivalents of the
   native-sequence                cytokines, including synthetically   produced    small-molecule  entities   and
   pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives and salts thereof.                Cytokines can be classified on the
   proximal location of the intended target, wherein autocrine refers to action on the same cell from
20 which it is secreted, paracrinerefers to action restricted to the immediate vicinity into which the
   cytokine is secreted, and endocrine refers to action in distant regions of the body. Immune cytokines
   can also be classified by whether they enhance a type I response, (e.g., IFN-y, TGF-p etc), which
   favor cellular immunity or a type II response (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, etc.), which favor antibody or
   humoral immunity.                  Immune cytokines play roles in co-stimulation, maturation, proliferation,
25 activation, inflammation, growth, differentiation, cytokines production and secretion, survival of
   various immune cells.
                 The term "hormone" refers to polypeptide hormones, which are generally secreted by
   glandular organs with ducts. Included among the hormones are, for example, growth hormone such
   as human growth hormone, N-methionyl human growth hormone, and bovine growth hormone;
30 parathyroid hormone; thyroxine; insulin; proinsulin; relaxin; estradiol; hormone-replacement therapy;
   androgens            such as calusterone,       dromostanolone    propionate,  epitiostanol, mepitiostane,  or
   testolactone; prorelaxin; glycoprotein hormones such as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid
   stimulating hormone (TSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH); prolactin, placental lactogen, mouse
   gonadotropin-associated peptide, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; inhibin; activin; mullerian
35 inhibiting substance; and thrombopoietin. As used herein, the term hormone includes proteins from
                                                              64

   natural sources or from recombinant cell culture and biologically active equivalents of the native
   sequence hormone, including synthetically produced small-molecule entities and pharmaceutically
   acceptable derivatives and salts thereof.
 5 111.         Modes for Carrying out the Invention
                A.            Humanization Using Phage Display
                 The hypervariable region-grafted variants described herein were generated by Kunkel
   mutagenesis of nucleic acid encoding the human acceptor sequences, using a separate oligonucleotide
   for each hypervariable region. Kunkel et al., Methods Enzymol. 154:367-382 (1987). Appropriate
10 changes can be introduced within the framework and/or hypervariable region using routine
   techniques, to correct and re-establish proper hypervariable region-antigen interactions.
                Phage(mid) display (also referred to herein as phage display) can be used as a convenient and
   fast method for generating and screening many different potential variant antibodies in a library
   generated by sequence randomization. However, other methods for making and screening altered
15 antibodies are available to the skilled person.
                Phage(mid) display (also referred to herein as phage display in some contexts) can be used as a
   convenient and fast method for generating and screening many different potential variant antibodies in a
   library generated by sequence randomization. However, other methods for making and screening altered
   antibodies are available to the skilled person.
20              Phage(mid) display technology has provided a powerful tool for generating and selecting novel
   proteins which bind to a ligand, such as an antigen. Using the techniques of phage(mid) display allows the
   generation of large libraries of protein variants which can be rapidly sorted for those sequences that bind
   to a target molecule with high affinity. Nucleic acids encoding variant polypeptides are generally fused to
   a nucleic acid sequence encoding a viral coat protein, such as the gene III protein or the gene VIII protein.
25 Monovalent phagemid display systems where the nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein or
   polypeptide is fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a portion of the gene III protein have been
   developed. (Bass, S., Proteins, 8:309 (1990); Lowman and Wells, Methods: A Companion to Methods in
   Enzymology, 3:205 (1991)).             In a monovalent phagemid display system, the gene fusion is expressed at
   low levels and wild type gene III proteins are also expressed so that infectivity of the particles is retained.
30 Methods of generating peptide libraries and screening those libraries have been disclosed in many patents
   (e.g. U.S. Patent No. 5,723,286, U.S. Patent No. 5,432, 018, U.S. Patent No. 5,580,717, U.S. Patent No.
   5,427,908 and U.S. Patent No. 5,498,530).
                Libraries of antibodies or antigen binding polypeptides have been prepared in a number of
   ways including by altering a single gene by inserting random DNA sequences or by cloning a family
                                                            65
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   of related genes. Methods for displaying antibodies or antigen binding fragments using phage(mid)
   display have been described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,750,373, 5,733,743, 5,837,242, 5,969,108,
   6,172,197, 5,580,717, and 5,658,727.       The library is then screened for expression of antibodies or
   antigen binding proteins with the desired characteristics.
 5              Methods of substituting an amino acid of choice into a template nucleic acid are well
   established in the art, some of which are described herein.         For example, hypervariable region
   residues can be substituted using the Kunkel method. See, e.g., Kunkel et al., Methods Enzymol.
   154:367-382 (1987).
                The sequence of oligonucleotides includes one or more of the designed codon sets for the
10 hypervariable region residues to be altered.       A codon set is a set of different nucleotide triplet
   sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids. Codon sets can be represented using symbols
   to designate particular nucleotides or equimolar mixtures of nucleotides as shown in below according
   to the IUB code.
                                                   IUB CODES
   G (Guanine)                         Y (C or T)                       H (A or C or T)
   A (Adenine)                         M (A or C)                       B (C or G or T)
   T (Thymine)                         K (G or T)                       V (A or C or G)
   C (Cytosine)                        S (C or G)                       D (A or G or T)
   R (A or G)                          W (A or T)                       N (AorCorGorT)
   For example, in the codon set DVK, D can be nucleotides A or G or T; V can be A or G or C;
   and K can be G or T. This codon set can present 18 different codons and can encode amino acids
   Ala, Trp, Tyr, Lys, Thr, Asn, Lys, Ser, Arg, Asp, Glu, Gly, and Cys.
15
                Oligonucleotide or primer sets can be synthesized using standard methods. A set of
   oligonucleotides can be synthesized, for example, by solid phase synthesis, containing sequences that
   represent all possible combinations of nucleotide triplets provided by the codon set and that will
   encode the desired group of amino acids.         Synthesis of oligonucleotides with selected nucleotide
20 "degeneracy" at certain positions is well known in that art. Such sets of nucleotides having certain
   codon sets can be synthesized using commercial nucleic acid synthesizers (available from, for
   example, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), or can be obtained commercially (for example, from
   Life Technologies, Rockville, MD).         Therefore, a set of oligonucleotides synthesized having a
   particular codon set will typically include a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences, the
                                                        66
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   differences established by the codon set within the overall sequence.             Oligonucleotides, as used
   according to the invention, have sequences that allow for hybridization to a variable domain nucleic
   acid template and also can include restriction enzyme sites for cloning purposes.
                In one method, nucleic acid sequences encoding variant amino acids can be created by
 5 oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis.          This technique is well known in the art as described by
   Zoller et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 10:6487-6504(1987).             Briefly, nucleic acid sequences encoding
   variant amino acids are created by hybridizing an oligonucleotide set encoding the desired codon sets
   to a DNA template, where the template is the single-stranded form of the plasmid containing a
   variable region nucleic acid template sequence. After hybridization, DNA polymerase is used to
10 synthesize an entire second complementary strand of the template that will thus incorporate the
   oligonucleotide primer, and will contain the codon sets as provided by the oligonucleotide set.
                Generally, oligonucleotides of at least 25 nucleotides in length are used.         An optimal
   oligonucleotide will have 12 to 15 nucleotides that are completely complementary to the template on
   either side of the nucleotide(s) coding for the mutation(s). This ensures that the oligonucleotide will
15 hybridize properly to the single-stranded DNA template molecule. The oligonucleotides are readily
   synthesized using techniques known in the art such as that described by Crea et al., Proc.Nat'l. Acad.
   Sci. USA, 75:5765 (1978).
                The DNA template is generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage
   M13 vectors (the commercially available Ml3mp 18 and Ml3mp 19 vectors are suitable), or those
20 vectors that contain a single-stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al., Meth.
   Enzymol., 153:3 (1987).            Thus, the DNA that is to be mutated can be inserted into one of these
   vectors in order to generate a single-stranded template. Production of the single-stranded template is
   described in sections 4.21-4.41 of Sambrook et al., above.
                To alter the native DNA sequence, the oligonucleotide is hybridized to the single stranded
25 template under suitable hybridization conditions. A DNA polymerizing enzyme, usually T7 DNA
   polymerase or the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, is then added to synthesize the
   complementary strand of the template using the oligonucleotide as a primer for synthesis.                 A
   heteroduplex molecule is thus formed such that one strand of DNA encodes the mutated form of gene
    1, and the other strand (the original template) encodes the native, unaltered sequence of gene 1. This
30 heteroduplex molecule is then transformed into a suitable host cell, usually a prokaryote such as E.
   coli JM1O1. After growing the cells, they are plated onto agarose plates and screened using the
                                                        32
   oligonucleotide primer radiolabelled with a             -Phosphate to identify the bacterial colonies that
   contain the mutated DNA.
                The method described immediately above may be modified such that a homoduplex molecule
35 is created wherein both strands of the plasmid contain the mutation(s). The modifications are as
                                                            67
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   follows: The single stranded oligonucleotide is annealed to the single-stranded template as described
   above. A mixture of three deoxyribonucleotides, deoxyriboadenosine (dATP), deoxyriboguanosine
   (dGTP), and deoxyribothymidine (dTT), is combined with a modified thiodeoxyribocytosine called
   dCTP-(aS) (which can be obtained from Amersham).              This mixture is added to the template
 5 oligonucleotide complex. Upon addition of DNA polymerase to this mixture, a strand of DNA
   identical to the template except for the mutated bases is generated. In addition, this new strand of
   DNA will contain dCTP-(aS) instead of dCTP, which serves to protect it from restriction
   endonuclease digestion. After the template strand of the double-stranded heteroduplex is nicked with
   an appropriate restriction enzyme, the template strand can be digested with ExollI nuclease or
10 another appropriate nuclease to cut at         other than the region that contains the site(s) to be
   mutagenized. The reaction is then stopped to leave a molecule that is only partially single-stranded.
   A complete double-stranded DNA homoduplex is then formed using DNA polymerase in the
   presence of all four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, ATP, and DNA ligase. This homoduplex
   molecule can then be transformed into a suitable host cell.
15              As indicated previously, the sequence of the oligonucleotide set is of sufficient length to
   hybridize to the template nucleic acid and may also, but does not necessarily, contain restriction sites.
   The DNA template can be generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage M13
   vectors or vectors that contain a single-stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et
   al. Meth. Enzymol., 153:3 (1987). Thus, the DNA that is to be mutated must be inserted into one of
20 these vectors in order to generate a single-stranded template.        Production of the single-stranded
   template is described in sections 4.21-4.41 of Sambrook et al., supra.
                According to another method, a library can be generated by providing upstream and
   downstream oligonucleotide sets, each set having a plurality of oligonucleotides with different
   sequences, the different sequences established by the codon sets provided within the sequence of the
25 oligonucleotides. The upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets, along with a variable domain
   template nucleic acid sequence, can be used in a polymerase chain reaction to generate a "library" of
   PCR products. The PCR products can be referred to as "nucleic acid cassettes", as they can be fused
   with other related or unrelated nucleic acid sequences, for example, viral coat proteins and
   dimerization domains, using established molecular biology techniques.
30               The sequence of the PCR primers includes one or more of the designed codon sets for the
   solvent accessible and highly diverse positions in a hypervariable region. As described above, a
   codon set is a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids.
   Antibody selectants that meet the desired criteria, as selected through appropriate screening/selection
   steps can be isolated and cloned using standard recombinant techniques.

                B.            Recombinant Preparation
                 The invention also provides an isolated nucleic acid encoding anti-PD-LI antibodies, vectors
   and host cells comprising such nucleic acid, and recombinant techniques for the production of the
   antibody.
 5               For recombinant production of the antibody, the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and
   inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression.
   DNA encoding the monoclonal antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional
   procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes
   encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody).                Many vectors are available. The choice of
10 vector depends in part on the host cell to be used.                 Generally, preferred host cells are of either
   prokaryotic or eukaryotic (generally mammalian) origin.
                                      1. Antibody Production in Prokaryotic Cells
                                        a)     Vector Construction
15               Polynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide components of the antibodies of the
   invention can be obtained using standard recombinant techniques. Desired polynucleotide sequences
   may be isolated and sequenced from antibody producing                           cells such as hybridoma     cells.
   Alternatively, polynucleotides can be synthesized using nucleotide synthesizer or PCR techniques.
   Once obtained, sequences encoding the polypeptides are inserted into a recombinant vector capable
20 of replicating and expressing heterologous polynucleotides in prokaryotic hosts. Many vectors that
   are available and known in the art can be used for the purpose of the present invention. Selection of
   an appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acids to be inserted into the vector
   and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector.                     Each vector contains various
   components, depending on its function (amplification or expression of heterologous polynucleotide,
25 or both) and its compatibility with the particular host cell in which it resides. The vector components
   generally include, but are not limited to: an origin of replication, a selection marker gene, a promoter,
   a ribosome binding site (RBS), a signal sequence, the heterologous nucleic acid insert and a
   transcription termination sequence.
                 In general, plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from
30 species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily
   carries a replication site, as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic
   selection in transformed cells. For example,            . coli is typically transformed using pBR322, a plasmid
   derived from an . coli species. pBR322 contains genes encoding ampicillin (Amp) and tetracycline
   (Tet) resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells. pBR322, its
                                                               69
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   derivatives, or other microbial plasmids or bacteriophage may also contain, or be modified to contain,
   promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for expression of endogenous proteins.
   Examples of pBR322 derivatives used for expression of particular antibodies are described in detail
   in Carter et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,648,237.
 5              In addition, phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with
   the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For
   example, bacteriophage such as GEM.TM.-l1 may be utilized in making a recombinant vector which
   can be used to transform susceptible host cells such as . coli LE392.
                The expression vector of the invention may comprise two or more promoter-cistron pairs,
10 encoding each of the polypeptide components. A promoter is an untranslated regulatory sequence
   located upstream (5') to a cistron that modulates its expression. Prokaryotic promoters typically fall
   into two classes, inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoter is a promoter that initiates increased
   levels of transcription of the cistron under its control in response to changes in the culture condition,
   e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.
15              A large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known.
   The selected promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding the light or heavy chain by
   removing the promoter from the source DNA via restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the
   isolated promoter sequence into the vector of the invention. Both the native promoter sequence and
   many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and/or expression of the target
20 genes. In some embodiments, heterologous promoters are utilized, as they generally permit greater
   transcription and higher yields of expressed target gene as compared to the native target polypeptide
   promoter.
                Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the PhoA promoter, the
   galactamase and lactose promoter systems, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system and hybrid promoters
25 such as the tac or the trc promoter. However, other promoters that are functional in bacteria (such as
   other known bacterial or phage promoters) are suitable as well. Their nucleotide sequences have
   been published, thereby enabling a skilled worker operably to ligate them to cistrons encoding the
   target light and heavy chains (Siebenlist et al. (1980) Cell 20: 269) using linkers or adaptors to
   supply any required restriction sites.
30              In one aspect, each cistron within the recombinant vector comprises a secretion signal
   sequence component that directs translocation of the expressed polypeptides across a membrane. In
   general, the signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it may be a part of the target
   polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence selected for the purpose of this
   invention should be one that is recognized and processed (i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the
35 host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the signal sequences native to
                                                          70
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   the heterologous polypeptides, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence
   selected, for example, from the group consisting of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, Ipp, or
   heat-stable enterotoxin II (STII) leaders, LamB, PhoE, PelB, OmpA and MBP. In one embodiment of
   the invention, the signal sequences used in both cistrons of the expression system are STII signal
 5 sequences or variants thereof.
                In another aspect, the production of the immunoglobulins according to the invention can
   occur in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and therefore does not require the presence of secretion signal
   sequences within each cistron. In that regard, immunoglobulin light and heavy chains are expressed,
   folded and assembled to form functional immunoglobulins within the cytoplasm. Certain host strains
10 (e.g., the E. coli trxB- strains) provide cytoplasm conditions that are favorable for disulfide bond
   formation, thereby permitting proper folding and assembly of expressed protein subunits.             Proba and
   Pluckthun Gene, 159:203 (1995).
                 The present invention provides an expression system in which the quantitative ratio of
   expressed polypeptide components can be modulated in order to maximize the yield of secreted and
15 properly assembled antibodies of the invention. Such modulation is accomplished at least in part by
   simultaneously modulating translational strengths for the polypeptide components.
   One technique for modulating translational strength is disclosed in Simmons et al., U.S. Pat. No.
   5,840,523. It utilizes variants of the translational initiation region (TIR) within a cistron. For a given
   TIR, a series of amino acid or nucleic acid sequence variants can be created with a range of
20 translational strengths, thereby providing a convenient means by which to adjust this factor for the
   desired expression level of the specific chain. TIR variants can be generated by conventional
   mutagenesis techniques that result in codon changes which can alter the amino acid sequence,
   although silent changes in the nucleotide sequence are preferred. Alterations in the TIR can include,
   for example, alterations in the number or spacing of Shine-Dalgarno sequences, along with
25 alterations in the signal sequence.            One method for generating mutant signal sequences is the
   generation of a "codon bank" at the beginning of a coding sequence that does not change the amino
   acid sequence of the signal sequence (i.e., the changes are silent).            This can be accomplished by
   changing the third nucleotide position of each codon; additionally, some amino acids, such as
   leucine, serine, and arginine, have multiple first and second positions that can add complexity in
30 making the bank. This method of mutagenesis is described in detail in Yansura et al. (1992)
   METHODS: A Companion to Methods in Enzymol. 4:151-158.
                 Preferably, a set of vectors is generated with a range of TIR strengths for each cistron therein.
   This limited set provides a comparison of expression levels of each chain as well as the yield of the
   desired antibody products under various TIR strength combinations.                    TIR strengths can be
35 determined by quantifying the expression level of a reporter gene as described in detail in Simmons
                                                            71

   et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5, 840,523. Based on the translational strength comparison, the desired individual
   TIRs are selected to be combined in the expression vector constructs of the invention.
                                        b)       Prokaryotichost cells.
 5              Prokaryotic           host cells   suitable for expressing  antibodies  of the invention include
   Archaebacteria and Eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms. Examples of
   useful bacteria include Escherichia (e.g., E. coli), Bacilli (e.g., B. subtilis), Enterobacteria,
   Pseudomonas species (e.g.,                   P. aeruginosa), Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescans,
   Klebsiella, Proteus, Shigella, Rhizobia, Vitreoscilla, or Paracoccus. In one embodiment, gram
10 negative cells are used.                In one embodiment, E. coli cells are used as hosts for the invention.
   Examples of E. coli strains include strain W3 110 (Bachmann, Cellular and Molecular Biology, vol. 2
   (Washington, D.C.: American Society for Microbiology, 1987), pp. 1190-1219; ATCC Deposit No.
   27,325) and derivatives thereof, including strain 33D3 having genotype W3 110               fhuA   (ftonA) ptr3
   lac Iq lacL8 jompTj(nmpc-fepE) degP41 kanR (U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,635).                       Other strains and
15 derivatives thereof, such as E. coli 294 (ATCC 31,446), E. coli B, E. coli 1776 (ATCC 31,537) and
   E. coli RV308(ATCC 31,608) are also suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.
   Methods for constructing derivatives of any of the above-mentioned bacteria having defined
   genotypes are known in the art and described in, for example, Bass et al., Proteins, 8:309-314 (1990).
   It is generally necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration replicability of the
20 replicon in the cells of a bacterium. For example, E. coli, Serratia, or Salmonella species can be
   suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such as pBR322, pBR325, pACYC177, or
   pKN410 are used to supply the replicon.
                  Typically the host cell should secrete minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes, and
   additional protease inhibitors may desirably be incorporated in the cell culture.
25                                      c)       Antibody Production
                 Host cells are transformed with the above-described expression vectors and cultured in
   conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants,
   or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.                 Transformation means introducing DNA
   into the prokaryotic host so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by
30 chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard
   techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride is generally
   used for bacterial cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers. Another method for transformation
   employs polyethylene glycol/DMSO. Yet another technique used is electroporation.
                                                                 72
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

                Prokaryotic cells used to produce the antibodies of the invention are grown in media known
   in the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells. Examples of suitable media include luria
   broth (LB) plus necessary nutrient supplements. In some embodiments, the media also contains a
   selection agent, chosen based on the construction of the expression vector, to selectively permit
 5 growth of prokaryotic cells containing the expression vector. For example, ampicillin is added to
   media for growth of cells expressing ampicillin resistant gene.
                Any necessary supplements besides carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic phosphate sources may
   also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another
   supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. Optionally the culture medium may
10 contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione, cysteine,
   cystamine, thioglycollate, dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol.
                The prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures.      For E. coli growth, for
   example, the preferred temperature ranges from about 20'C to about 39'C, more preferably from
   about 25'C to about 37'C, even more preferably at about 30'C. The pH of the medium may be any
15 pH ranging from about 5 to about 9, depending mainly on the host organism. For . coli, the pH is
   preferably from about 6.8 to about 7.4, and more preferably about 7.0.
                 If an inducible promoter is used in the expression vector of the invention, protein expression
   is induced under conditions suitable for the activation of the promoter.              In one aspect of the
   invention, PhoA promoters are used for controlling transcription of the polypeptides. Accordingly,
20 the transformed host cells are cultured in a phosphate-limiting medium for induction. Preferably, the
   phosphate-limiting medium is the C.R.A.P medium (see, e.g., Simmons et al., J. Immunol. Methods
   (2002), 263:133-147). A variety of other inducers may be used, according to the vector construct
   employed, as is known in the art.
                 The expressed antibody proteins of the present invention are secreted into and recovered
25 from the periplasm of the host cells.                Protein recovery typically involves disrupting the
   microorganism, generally by such means as osmotic shock, sonication or lysis.                Once cells are
   disrupted, cell debris or whole cells may be removed by centrifugation or filtration. The proteins
   may be further purified, for example, by affinity resin chromatography. Alternatively, proteins can
   be transported into the culture media and isolated therein. Cells may be removed from the culture
30 and the culture supernatant being filtered and concentrated for further purification of the proteins
   produced. The expressed polypeptides can be further isolated and identified using commonly known
   methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blot assay.
                Alternatively, antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a fermentation process.
   Various large-scale fed-batch fermentation procedures are available for production of recombinant
35 proteins. Large-scale fermentations have at least 1000 liters of capacity, preferably about 1,000 to
                                                           73
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

    100,000 liters of capacity. These fermentors use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients,
   especially glucose (the preferred carbon/energy source). Small scale fermentation refers generally to
   fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity, and
   can range from about 1 liter to about 100 liters.
 5               During the fermentation process, induction of protein expression is typically initiated after
   the cells have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density, e.g., an OD 5 5 0 of about
    180-220, at which stage the cells are in the early stationary phase. A variety of inducers may be used,
   according to the vector construct employed, as is known in the art and described above. Cells may be
   grown for shorter periods prior to induction.               Cells are usually induced for about 12-50 hours,
10 although longer or shorter induction time may be used.
                 To improve the production yield and quality of the antibodies of the invention, various
   fermentation conditions can be modified. For example, to improve the proper assembly and folding
   of the secreted antibody polypeptides, additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins, such as
   Dsb proteins (DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, DsbD and or DsbG) or FkpA (a peptidylprolyl cis,trans-isomerase
15 with chaperone activity) can be used to co-transform the host prokaryotic cells.               The chaperone
   proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous
   proteins produced in bacterial host cells. Chen et al. (1999) JBio Chem 274:19601-19605; Georgiou
   et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,083,715; Georgiou et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,027,888; Bothmann and
   Pluckthun (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275:17100-17105; Ramm and Pluckthun (2000) J. Biol. Chem.

                 To minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins (especially those that are
   proteolytically sensitive), certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the
   present invention. For example, host cell strains may be modified to effect genetic mutation(s) in the
   genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III, OmpT, DegP, Tsp, Protease I,
25 Protease Mi, Protease V, Protease VI and combinations thereof                  Some E. coli protease-deficient
   strains are available and described in, for example, Joly et al. (1998), supra; Georgiou et al., U.S.
   Patent No. 5,264,365; Georgiou et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,508,192; Hara et al., Microbial Drug
   Resistance, 2:63-72 (1996).
                E. coli strains          deficient  for proteolytic  enzymes   and transformed   with plasmids
30 overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins may be used as host cells in the expression system
   encoding the antibodies of the invention.
                                      d)       Antibody Purification
                 The antibody protein produced herein is further purified to obtain preparations that are
   substantially homogeneous for further assays and uses. Standard protein purification methods known
                                                               74
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   in the art can be employed.                    The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification
   procedures: fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns, ethanol precipitation, reverse
   phase        HPLC,           chromatography       on silica   or on a cation-exchange   resin such as DEAE,
   chromatofocusing,                  SDS-PAGE,     ammonium sulfate precipitation, and gel filtration using, for
 5 example, Sephadex G-75.
                In one aspect, Protein A immobilized on a solid phase is used for immunoaffinity purification
   of the full length antibody products of the invention. Protein A is a 4lkD cell wall protein from
   Staphylococcus aureas which binds with a high affinity to the Fc region of antibodies. Lindmark et
   al (1983) J. Immunol. Meth. 62:1-13.                      The solid phase to which Protein A is immobilized is
10 preferably a column comprising a glass or silica surface, more preferably a controlled pore glass
   column or a silicic acid column. In some applications, the column has been coated with a reagent,
   such as glycerol, in an attempt to prevent nonspecific adherence of contaminants. The solid phase is
   then washed to remove contaminants non-specifically bound to the solid phase. Finally the antibody
   of interest is recovered from the solid phase by elution.

                              2.            Antibody Production in Eukaryotic Cells
                 For Eukaryotic expression, the vector components generally include, but are not limited to,
   one or more of the following, a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes,
   and enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.
20                                       a)       Signal sequence component
                A vector for use in a eukaryotic host may also an insert that encodes a signal sequence or
   other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or
   polypeptide.             The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and
   processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell.                In mammalian cell expression,
25 mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD
   signal, are available.
                The DNA for such precursor region is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the
   antibodies of the invention.
                                         b)       Origin of replication
30               Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression
   vectors (the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter).
                                                                   75
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

                                      c) Selection gene component
                Expression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable
   marker.         Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other
   toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic
 5 deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media, e.g., the gene
   encoding D-alanine racemase for Bacilli.
                 One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells
   that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug
   resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs
10 neomycin, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.
                Another example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the
   identification of cells competent to take up nucleic acid encoding the antibodies of the invention,
   such as DHFR, thymidine kinase, metallothionein-I and -II, preferably primate metallothionein genes,
   adenosine deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, etc.
15              For example, cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing
   all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive
   antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the Chinese
   hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in DHFR activity (e.g., ATCC CRL-9096).
                Alternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR)
20 transformed or co-transformed with the antibody encoding-DNA sequences, wild-type DHFR protein,
   and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3-phosphotransferase (APH) can be selected
   by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an
   aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin, neomycin, or G418. See U.S. Patent No. 4,965,199.
                                      d) Promoter component
25              Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host
   organism and is operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the desired antibody sequences.
   Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 based upstream
   from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from
   the start of the transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucletotide. A
30 the 3' end of most eukaryotic is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly
   A tail to the 3' end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences may be inserted into eukaryotic
   expression vectors.
                 Other promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the phoA promoter          ,
   lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase promoter, a tryptophan (trp) promoter
35 system, and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter. However, other known bacterial promoters
                                                          76
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   are suitable.             Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.)
   sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding the antibody polypeptide.
                Antibody polypeptide transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled, for
   example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus,
 5 adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a
   retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and most preferably Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous
   mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock
   promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.
                The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40
10 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication.           The immediate early
   promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindlII E restriction fragment.
   A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is
   disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,419,446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Patent No.
   4,601,978.            See also Reyes et al., Nature 297:598-601 (1982) on expression of human -interferon
15 cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus.
   Alternatively, the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.
                                       e)   Enhancerelement component
                Transcription of a DNA encoding the antibodies of this invention by higher eukaryotes is
   often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are
20 now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, a-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically,
   however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus.                Examples include the SV40
   enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter
   enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers.
   See also Yaniv, Nature 297:17-18 (1982) on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic
25 promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5' or 3' to the antibody encoding
   sequence, but is preferably located at a site 5' from the promoter.
                                      J)     Transcriptiontermination component
                Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or
   nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences necessary for the
30 termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available
   from the 5' and, occasionally 3', untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These
   regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated
   portion of the antobdy-encoding mRNA. One useful transcription termination component is the
   bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region.                  See W094/11026 and the expression vector
35 disclosed therein.
                                                             77

                 Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include higher
   eukaryote cells described herein, including vertebrate host cells. Propagation of vertebrate cells in
   culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure.              Examples of useful mammalian host cell

   antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing

   (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES),
   nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCINTM drug), trace
30 elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar
   range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be
   included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture
   conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected
   for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.

                                         i) Purificationof antibody
                 When using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, in the
   periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as
   a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, are removed, for example, by
 5 centrifugation or ultrafiltration.                Carter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992) describe a
   procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space of E. coli. Briefly, cell
   paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride
   (PMSF) over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is
   secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated
10 using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore
   Pellicon ultrafiltration unit.              A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the
   foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of
   adventitious contaminants.
                The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example,
15 hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with
   affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an
   affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present
   in the antibody.                   Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human
   immunoglobulins containing 1, 2, or 4 heavy chains (Lindmark et al., J. Immunol. Meth. 62:1-13
20 (1983)).        Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 3 (Guss et al., EMBO J.
   5:15671575 (1986)).                 The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but
   other matrices are available.                  Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or
   poly(styrene-divinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be
   achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a                  CH3 domain, the Bakerbond ABXTMresin (J.
25 T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such
   as    fractionation on an ion-exchange                  column,   ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase     HPLC,
   chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSETM chromatography on an anion
   or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid colunm), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and
   ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.
30               Following any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of
   interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using
   an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt concentrations (e.g.,
   from about 0-0.25M salt).

                               1)      Polyclonalantibodies
                 Polyclonal antibodies are generally raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous (sc) or
   intraperitoneal (ip) injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate
 5 the relevant antigen to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, e.g., keyhole
   limpet hemocyanin (KLH), serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor, using
   a bifunctional or derivatizing agent, e.g., maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation
   through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysien residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic
   anhydride, SOCl2, or R1N=C=NR, where R and R' are independently lower alkyl groups. Examples
10 of adjuvants which may be employed include Freund's complete adjuvant and MPL-TDM adjuvant
   (monophosphoryl Lipid A, synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate). The immunization protocol may
   be selected by one skilled in the art without undue experimentation.
                 The animals are immunized against the antigen, immunogenic conjugates, or derivatives by
   combining, e.g., 100 tg or 5 kg or the protein or conjugate (for rabbits or mice, respectively) with 3
15 volumes of Freund's complete adjuvant and injecting the solution intradermally at multiple sites.
   One month later, the animals are boosted with 1/5 to 1/10 the original amount of peptide or conjugate
   in Freund's complete adjuvant by subcutaneous injection at multiple sites. Seven to fourteen days
   later, the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the
   titer plateaus. Conjugates also can be made in recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also,
20 aggregating agents such as alum are suitable to enhance the immune response.
                               2)      Monoclonal antibodies
                 Monoclonal antibodies are obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous
   antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible
25 naturally          occurring       mutations and/or post-translational modifications (e.g., isomerizations,
   amidations) that may be present in minor amounts. Thus, the modifier "monoclonal" indicates the
   character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies.
                 For example, the monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first
   described by Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods
30 (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567).
                In the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is
   immunized as hereinabove described to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing
   antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization.                  Alternatively,
   lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a
                                                              80
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, Monoclonal
   Antibodies: Principlesand Practice,pp.59-103 (Academic Press, 1986).
                The immunizing agent will typically include the antigenic protein or a fusion variant thereof.
   Generally either peripheral blood lymphocytes ("PBLs") are used if cells of human origin are desired,
 5 or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if non-human mammalian sources are desired. The
   lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as
   polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell.            Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and
   Practice,Academic Press (1986), pp. 59-103.
                Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells, particularly myeloma cells
10 of rodent, bovine and human origin. Usually, rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The
   hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably
   contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma
   cells.        For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine
   phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will
15 include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which are substances that prevent
   the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.
                Preferred immortalized myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high
   level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium
   such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from
20 MOPC-21 and MPC-1 1 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San
   Diego, California USA, and SP-2 cells (and derivatives thereof, e.g., X63-Ag8-653) available from
   the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia USA.              Human myeloma and mouse
   human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal
   antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production
25 Techniques andApplications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).
                 Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of
   monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal
   antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro
   binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
30              The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can be assayed for the
   presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the desired antigen.           Preferably, the binding
   affinity and specificity of the monoclonal antibody can be determined by immunoprecipitation or by
   an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked assay (ELISA).             Such
   techniques and assays are known in the in art. For example, binding affinity may be determined by
35 the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al., Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980).
                                                          81
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

                After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity,
   affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by
   standard methods (Goding, supra). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D
   MEM or RPMI- 1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as tumors in a
 5 mammal.
                The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture
   medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for
   example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or
   affinity chromatography.
10              Monoclonal antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those
   described in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567, and as described above. DNA encoding the monoclonal
   antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using
   oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light
   chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once
15 isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells
   such as E. coli cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do
   not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, in order to synthesize monoclonal antibodies in such
   recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the
   antibody include Skerra et al., Curr. Opinion in Immunol., 5:256-262 (1993) and Plickthun,
20 Immunol. Revs. 130:151-188 (1992).
                In a further embodiment, antibodies can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated
   using the techniques described in McCafferty et al., Nature, 348:552-554 (1990).          Clackson et al.,
   Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 (1991) describe the
   isolation of murine and human antibodies, respectively, using phage libraries.                 Subsequent
25 publications describe the production of high affinity (nM range) human antibodies by chain shuffling
   (Marks et al., Bio/Technology, 10:779-783 (1992)), as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo
   recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries (Waterhouse et al., Nucl. Acids
   Res., 21:2265-2266 (1993)). Thus, these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal
   antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.
30              The DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human
   heavy- and light-chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Patent
   No. 4,816,567; Morrison, et al., Proc.Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 8:6851 (1984)), or by covalently joining
   to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin
   polypeptide.              Typically such non-immunoglobulin polypeptides are substituted for the constant
35 domains of an antibody, or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining
                                                           82

   site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen-combining site
   having specificity for an antigen and another antigen-combining site having specificity for a different
   antigen.
                The monoclonal antibodies described herein may by monovalent, the preparation of which is
 5 well known in the art.                    For example, one method involves recombinant       expression of
   immunoglobulin light chain and a modified heavy chain. The heavy chain is truncated generally at
   any point in the Fc region so as to prevent heavy chain crosslinking. Alternatively, the relevant
   cysteine residues may be substituted with another amino acid residue or are deleted so as to prevent
   crosslinking. In vitro methods are also suitable for preparing monovalent antibodies. Digestion of
10 antibodies to produce fragments thereof, particularly Fab fragments, can be accomplished using
   routine techniques known in the art.
                 Chimeric or hybrid antibodies also may be prepared in vitro using known methods in
   synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents.                  For example,
   immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide-exchange reaction or by forming a thioether
15 bond.         Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4
   mercaptobutyrimidate.
                              3)       Humanized antibodies.
                 The antibodies of the invention may further comprise humanized or human antibodies.
20 Humanized forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins,
   immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2 or other antigen-binding
   subsequences               of antibodies)   which contain     minimal sequence derived   from non-human
   immunoglobulin.                  Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in
   which residues from a complementarity determining region (CDR) (HVR as used herein) of the
25 recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as
   mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity.          In some instances, Fv
   framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human
   residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient
   antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will
30 comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domain, in which all or
   substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or
   substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The
   humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant
   region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Jones et al., Nature 321: 522-525 (1986);
                                                               83

   Riechmann et al., Nature 332: 323-329 (1988) and Presta, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2: 593-596
   (1992).
                Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art.              Generally, a
   humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is
 5 non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as "import" residues, which
   are typically taken from an "import" variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed
   following the method of Winter and co-workers, Jones et al., Nature                     321:522-525 (1986);
   Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534-1536 (1988), or
   through substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human
10 antibody.           Accordingly, such "humanized" antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Patent No.
   4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by
   the corresponding sequence from a non-human species.                  In practice, humanized antibodies are
   typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are
   substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.
15              The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the
   humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called "best-fit"
   method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire
   library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of
   the rodent is then accepted as the human framework (FR) for the humanized antibody. Sims et al., J.
20 Immunol., 15_1:2296 (1993); Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol., 196:901 (1987).            Another method uses a
   particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular
   subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized
   antibodies.           Carter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:4285 (1992); Presta et al., J. Immunol.,
    151:2623 (1993).
25               It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the
   antigen and other favorable biological properties.            To achieve this goal, according to a preferred
   method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and
   various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional                   models of the parental and
   humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are
30 familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display
   probable          three-dimensional     conformational  structures of selected candidate     immunoglobulin
   sequences.            Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the
   functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence
   the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be
35 selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody
                                                              84
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR
   residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.
                 Various forms of the humanized antibody are contemplated.             For example, the humanized
   antibody may be an antibody fragment, such as an Fab, which is optionally conjugated with one or
 5 more cytotoxic agent(s) in order to generate an immunoconjugate.                   Alternatively, the humanized
   antibody may be an intact antibody, such as an intact IgGI antibody.
                              4)         Human antibodies
                As an alternative to humanization, human antibodies can be generated. For example, it is
10 now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of
   producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin
   production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy
   chain joining region               (JH) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition
   of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in
15 such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge.
   See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., Nature,
   362:255-258 (1993); Bruggermann et al., Year in Immuno., 7:33 (1993); U.S. Patent Nos. 5,591,669
   and WO 97/17852.
                 Alternatively, phage display technology can be used to produce human antibodies and
20 antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from
   unimmunized donors. McCafferty et al., Nature 348:552-553 (1990); Hoogenboom and Winter, J.
   Mol. Biol. 227: 381 (1991).                 According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in
   frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or
   fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the
25 filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on
   the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody
   exhibiting those properties.                Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B-cell. Phage
   display can be performed in a variety of formats, reviewed in, e.g., Johnson, Kevin S. and Chiswell,
   David J., Curr. Opin Struct. Biol. 3:564-571 (1993). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used
30 for phage display.                 Clackson et al., Nature 352:624-628 (1991) isolated a diverse array of anti
   oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens
   of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed
   and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially
   following the techniques described by Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597 (1991), or Griffith et
35 al., EMBO J. 12:725-734 (1993). See also, U.S. Patent. Nos. 5,565,332 and 5,573,905.

                The techniques of Cole et al., and Boerner et al., are also available for the preparation of
   human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R.
   Liss, p. 77 (1985) and Boerner et al., J. Immunol. 147(1): 86-95 (1991). Similarly, human antibodies
   can be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which
 5 the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated.                     Upon
   challenge, human antibody production is observed, which closely resembles that seen in humans in
   all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly and antibody repertoire.               This approach is
   described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806, 5,569,825, 5,625,126, 5,633,425,
   5,661,016 and in the following scientific publications: Marks et al., Bio/Technology 10: 779-783
10 (1992); Lonberg et al., Nature 368: 856-859 (1994); Morrison, Nature 368: 812-13 (1994), Fishwild

   Lonberg and Huszar, Intern. Rev. Immunol. 13: 65-93 (1995).
                 Finally, human antibodies may also be generated in vitro by activated B cells (see U.S. Patent
   Nos 5,567,610 and 5,229,275).

                              5)      Antibody Fragments
              In certain circumstances there are advantages to using antibody fragments, rather than whole
   antibodies.           Smaller fragment sizes allow for rapid clearance, and may lead to improved access to
   solid tumors.
20            Various techniques have been developed             for the production of antibody fragments.
   Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g.,
   Morimoto et al., JBiochem Biophys. Method. 24:107-117 (1992); and Brennan et al., Science 229:81
   (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab, Fv
   and scFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from              . coli, thus allowing the
25 facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the
   antibody phage libraries discussed above.               Alternatively, Fab'-SH fragments can be directly
   recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form F(ab')                  2 fragments     (Carter et al.,
   Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992)).               According to another approach, F(ab')  2  fragments can be
   isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F(ab') 2 with increase in vivo half-life is
30 described in U.S. Patent No. 5,869,046. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single
   chain Fv fragment (scFv).               See WO 93/16185; U.S. Patent No. 5,571,894 and U.S. Patent No.
   5,587,458. The antibody fragment may also be a "linear antibody", e.g., as described in U.S. Patent
   5,641,870. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.

                               6)     Antibody Dependent Enzyme-Mediated ProdrugTherapy (ADEPT)
              The antibodies of the present invention may also be used in ADEPT by conjugating the
   antibody to a prodrug-activating enzyme which converts a prodrug (e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic
   agent, see WO 81/01145) to an active anti-cancer drug. See, for example, WO 88/07378 and U. S.
 5 Patent No. 4,975,278.
                The enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme
   capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to convert it into its more active, cytotoxic form.
                Enzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include, but are not limited to,
   glycosidase, glucose oxidase, human lysozyme, human glucuronidase, alkaline phosphatase useful for
10 converting phosphate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate
   containing prodrugs into free drugs; cytosine deaminase useful for converting non-toxic 5
   fluorocytosine into the anti-cancer drug 5-fluorouracil;                proteases, such as serratia protease,
   thermolysin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidases (e.g., carboxypeptidase G2 and carboxypeptidase A) and
   cathepsins (such as cathepsins B and L), that are useful for converting peptide-containing prodrugs
15 into free drugs; D-alanylcarboxypeptidases, useful for converting prodrugs that contain D-amino acid
   substituents; carbohydrate-cleaving enzymes such as $-galactosidase and neuraminidase useful for
   converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs;                 p-lactamase useful for converting drugs
   derivatized with P-lactams into free drugs; and penicillin amidases, such as penicillin Vamidase or
   penicillin G amidase, useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with
20 phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups, respectively, into free drugs. Alternatively, antibodies with
   enzymatic activity, also known in the art as "abzymes" can be used to convert the prodrugs of the
   invention into free active drugs (see, e.g., Massey, Nature 328: 457-458 (1987)).          Antibody-abzyme
   conjugates can be prepared as described herein for delivery of the abzyme to a tumor cell population.
                 The above enzymes can be covalently bound to the polypeptide or antibodies described
25 herein by techniques well known in the art such as the use of the heterobifunctional cross-linking
   agents discussed above. Alternatively, fusion proteins comprising at least the antigen binding region
   of the antibody of the invention linked to at least a functionally active portion of an enzyme of the
   invention can be constructed using recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art (see, e.g.
   Neuberger et al., Nature 312: 604-608 (1984)).
30
                               7)     Bispecific andpolyspecific antibodies
                 Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two
   different epitopes, including those on the same or another protein. Alternatively, one arm can bind to
   the target antigen, and another arm can be combined with an arm that binds to a triggering molecule
35 on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor molecule (e.g., CD3), or Fc receptors for IgG (FcyR) such as
                                                              87
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   FcyRl (CD64), FcyRII (CD32) and FcyRIII (CD16), so as to focus and localize cellular defense
   mechanisms to the target antigen-expressing cell. Such antibodies can be derived from full length
   antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab') 2 bispecific antibodies).
                 Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express the
 5 target antigen. Such antibodies possess one arm that binds the desired antigen and another arm that
   binds the cytotoxic agent (e.g., saporin, anti-interferon-a, vinca alkoloid, ricin A chain, methotrexate
   or radioactive isotope hapten).             Examples of known bispecific antibodies include anti-ErbB2/anti
   FcgRIII (WO 96/16673), anti-ErbB2/anti-FcgRI (U.S.P. 5,837,234), anti-ErbB2/anti-CD3 (U.S.P.
   5,821,337).
10               Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full
   length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy-chain/light
   chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities. Millstein et al., Nature, 305:537-539
   (1983).         Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these
   hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which
15 only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually
   done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low.
   Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829 and in Traunecker et al., EMBO J, 10:3655-3659
   (1991).
                According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding
20 specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain
   sequences.              The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain,
   comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy
   chain constant region (CHI) containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least
   one of the fusions.                DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the
25 immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into
   a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the
   three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains
   used in the construction provide the optimum yields.            It is, however, possible to insert the coding
   sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at
30 least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no
   particular significance.
                In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a
   hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid
   immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other
35 arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific
                                                             88
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   compound from unwanted                immunoglobulin    chain  combinations,   as the presence     of an
   immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecules provides for an easy way of
   separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94/04690. For further details of generating bispecific
   antibodies, see, for example, Suresh et al., Methods in Enzymology 121: 210 (1986).
 5              According to another approach described in WO 96/27011 or U.S.P. 5,731,168, the interface
   between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers
   which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part
   of the CH3 region of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid
   side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g.,
10 tyrosine or tryptophan).           Compensatory "cavities" of identical or similar size to the large side
   chains(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid
   side chains with smaller ones (e.g., alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing
   the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.
                 Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have been
15 described in the literature.         For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical
   linkage. Brennan et al., Science 229: 81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are
   proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab') 2 fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of
   the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular
   disulfide formation. The Fab' fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB)
20 derivatives. One of the Fab'-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab'-TNB derivative to form
   the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective
   immobilization of enzymes.
                Fab' fragments may be directly recovered from        . coli and chemically coupled to form
   bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., J. Exp. Med. 175: 217-225 (1992) describes the production of
25 fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab') 2 molecules. Each Fab' fragment was separately secreted
   from E. coli and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The
   bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and
   normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against
   human breast tumor targets.
30               Various techniques for making and isolating bivalent antibody fragments directly from
   recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bivalent heterodimers have been
   produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., J. Immunol., 148(5):1547-1553 (1992). The leucine
   zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab' portions of two different
   antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form
35 monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers.               The "diabody" technology
                                                          89
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   described by Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90: 6444-6448 (1993) has provided an
   alternative mechanism for making bispecific/bivalent antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a
   heavy-chain variable domain             (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) by a linker which
   is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the              VH  and
 5 VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and                    VH  domains of
   another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding                    sites. Another strategy for making
   bispecific/bivalent antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been
   reported. See Gruber et al., J. Immunol., 152:5368 (1994).
                Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated.               For example, trispecific
10 antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al., J. Immunol. 147: 60 (1991).
                Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes on a given molecule.
   Alternatively, an anti-protein arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule
   on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor molecule (e.g., CD2, CD3, CD28 or B7), or Fc receptors for
   IgG (FcyR), such as FcyRI (CD64), FcyRII (CD32) and FcyRIII (CD16) so as to focus cellular
15 defense mechanisms to the cell expressing the particular protein. Bispecific antibodies may also be
   used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express a particular protein. Such antibodies possess
   a protein-binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic agent or a radionuclide chelator, such as
   EOTUBE, DPTA, DOTA or TETA. Another bispecific antibody of interest binds the protein of
   interest and further binds tissue factor (TF).
20                             8)     Multivalent Antibodies
                A multivalent antibody may be internalized (and/or catabolized) faster than a bivalent
   antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present
   invention can be multivalent antibodies (which are other than of the IgM class) with three or more
   antigen binding sites (e.g. tetravalent antibodies), which can be readily produced by recombinant
25 expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody
   can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites.                     The preferred
   dimerization domain comprises (or consists of) an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario, the
   antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino-terminal to the Fc
   region. The preferred multivalent antibody herein comprises (or consists of) three to about eight, but
30 preferably four, antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide
   chain (and preferably two polypeptide chains), wherein the polypeptide chain(s) comprise two or
   more variable domains.              For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise VD1-(X1)n-VD2
   (X2)n-Fc, wherein VD1 is a first variable domain, VD2 is a second variable domain, Fc is one
   polypeptide chain of an Fc region, XI and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide, and n is 0 or 1.
35 For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise: VH-CH1-flexible linker-VH-CH1-Fc region
                                                              90
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   chain; or VH-CH1-VH-CH1-Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein preferably further
   comprises at least two (and preferably four) light chain variable domain polypeptides.                  The
   multivalent antibody herein may, for instance, comprise from about two to about eight light chain
   variable domain polypeptides.                The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here
 5 comprise a light chain variable domain and, optionally, further comprise a CL domain.
                               9)     HeteroconjugateAntibodies
                Heteroconjugate          antibodies  are  also  within  the  scope  of the   present invention.
   Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. For example, one of
10 the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies
   have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells, U.S.P. 4,676,980,
   and for treatment of HIV infection.                 WO 91/00360, WO 92/200373 and EP 0308936.          It is
   contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein
   chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents.                For example, immunotoxins may be
15 constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable
   reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate                 and those
   disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,676,980. Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using
   any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and
   are disclosed in US Patent No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.
20
                              10)     Effector FunctionEngineering
                 It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to Fc effector
   function, e.g.,             so as to modify (e.g., enhance or eliminate) antigen-dependent cell-mediated
   cyotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of the antibody.                     In a
25 preferred embodiment, Fc effector function of the anti-PD-Li antibodies is reduced or eliminated.
   This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in an Fc region of the
   antibody.          Alternatively or additionally, cysteine residue(s) may be introduced in the Fc region,
   thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus
   generated may have improved internalization capability and/or increased complement-mediated cell
30 killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).                 See Caron et al., J. Exp Med.
    176:1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, B. J. Immunol. 148:2918-2922 (1992). Homodimeric antibodies
   with enhanced anti-tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross-linkers as
   described in Wolff et al., Cancer Research 53:2560-2565 (1993). Alternatively, an antibody can be
   engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC
35 capabilities. See Stevenson et al., Anti-Cancer Drug Design 3:219-230 (1989).
                                                               91
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

                To increase the serum half life of the antibody, one may incorporate a salvage receptor
   binding epitope into the antibody (especially an antibody fragment) as described in U.S. Patent
   5,739,277, for example.              As used herein, the term "salvage receptor binding epitope" refers to an
   epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4) that is responsible for
 5 increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the IgG molecule.
                               11)    OtherAmino Acid Sequence Modifications
                Amino acid sequence modification(s) of the antibodies described herein are contemplated.
   For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of
10 the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate
   nucleotide changes into the antibody nucleic acid, or by peptide synthesis.              Such modifications
   include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within
   the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is
   made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired
15 characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processes of the antibody,
   such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.
                A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are
   preferred locations for mutagenesis is called "alanine scanning mutagenesis" as described by
   Cunningham and Wells in Science, 244:1081-1085 (1989).                   Here, a residue or group of target
20 residues are identified (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a
   neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to affect the
   interaction of the amino acids antigen.                Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional
   sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the
   sites of substitution.             Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is
25 predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze
   the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the
   target codon or region and the expressed antibody variants are screened for the desired activity.
                Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in
   length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as
30 intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions
   include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic
   polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C
   terminus of the antibody to an enzyme (e.g. for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum
   half-life of the antibody.
                                                               92
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

                Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least

                 Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by
   selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the
   polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation,
   (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain.
 5 Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:
                 (1) hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile;
                 (2) neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr;
                 (3) acidic: asp, glu;
                 (4) basic: asn, gln, his, lys, arg;
10               (5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and
                 (6) aromatic: trp, tyr, phe.
                Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for
   another class.
                Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antibody
15 also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and
   prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve
   its stability (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment).
                A particularly preferred type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more
   hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g. a humanized or human antibody). Generally,
20 the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have improved biological properties
   relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such
   substitutional variants involves             affinity maturation using phage display.      Briefly, several
   hypervariable region sites (e.g. 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at
   each site.            The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from
25 filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle.
   The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g. binding affinity) as
   herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, alanine
   scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing
   significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a
30 crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and
   its target (e.g., PD-Li, B7.1).           Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for
   substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the
   panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties
   in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

                Another type of amino acid variant of the antibody alters the original glycosylation pattern of
   the antibody. By altering is meant deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody,
   and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody.
                 Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or 0-linked. N-linked refers to the
 5 attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide
   sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except
   proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the
   asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide
   creates a potential glycosylation site. 0-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the
10 sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or
   threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.
                Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the
   amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences
   (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution
15 by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for 0-linked
   glycosylation sites).
                Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants to the antibodies of the
   invention are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not
   limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence
20 variants)          or preparation         by   oligonucleotide-mediated    (or site-directed)  mutagenesis,  PCR
   mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant versions.
                               12)       OtherAntibody Modifications
                The antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional
   nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably, the moieties
25 suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water-soluble polymers.                  Non-limiting examples of
   water-soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of
   ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose,                   dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl
   pyrrolidone,             poly-1,     3-dioxolane,   poly- 1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic   anhydride  copolymer,
   polyaminoacids                (either homopolymers      or random copolymers), and dextran or poly(n-vinyl
30 pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol homopolymers, polypropylene oxide/ethylene
   oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof.
   Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in
   water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. The
   number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary, and if more than one polymer is attached,
35 they can be the same or different molecules. In general, the number and/or type of polymers used for
                                                                    95

   derivatization can be determined based on considerations including, but not limited to, the particular
   properties or functions of the antibody to be improved, whether the antibody derivative will be used
   in a therapy under defined conditions, etc. Such techniques and other suitable formulations are
   disclosed in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Ed., Alfonso Gennaro, Ed.,
 5 Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science (2000).
                 D.           Pharmaceutical Formulations
                 Therapeutic formulations are prepared for storage by mixing the active ingredient having the
10 desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers
   (Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy,20th Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wiklins, Pub.,
   Gennaro Ed., Philadelphia, PA 2000). Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to
   recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers, antioxidants including
   ascorbic acid, methionine, Vitamin E, sodium metabisulfite; preservatives, isotonicifiers, stabilizers,
15 metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); chelating agents such as EDTA and/or non-ionic
   surfactants.
                 When the therapeutic agent is an antibody fragment, the smallest inhibitory fragment which
   specifically binds to the binding domain of the target protein is preferred. For example, based upon
   the variable region sequences of an antibody, antibody fragments or even peptide molecules can be
20 designed which retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence.                 Such peptides can be
   synthesized chemically and/or produced by recombinant DNA technology (see, e.g., Marasco et al.,
   Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 7889-7893 [1993]).
                 Buffers are used to control the pH in a range which optimizes the therapeutic effectiveness,
   especially if stability is pH dependent. Buffers are preferably present at concentrations ranging from
25 about 50 mM to about 250 mM. Suitable buffering agents for use with the present invention include
   both organic and inorganic acids and salts thereof. For example, citrate, phosphate, succinate,
   tartrate, fumarate, gluconate, oxalate, lactate, acetate.         Additionally, buffers may be comprised of
   histidine and trimethylamine salts such as Tris.
                 Preservatives are added to retard microbial growth, and are typically present in a range from
30 0.2%         - 1.0%           (w/v). Suitable preservatives   for use with the    present invention include
   octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium halides (e.g.,
   chloride, bromide, iodide), benzethonium chloride; thimerosal, phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl
   parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol, 3-pentanol, and m
   cresol.
35               Tonicity agents, sometimes known as "stabilizers" are present to adjust or maintain the
   tonicity of liquid in a composition. When used with large, charged biomolecules such as proteins and
                                                              96
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   antibodies, they are often termed "stabilizers" because they can interact with the charged groups of
   the amino acid side chains, thereby lessening the potential for inter and intra-molecular interactions.
   Tonicity agents can be present in any amount between 0.1% to 25% by weight, preferably 1 to 5%,
   taking into account the relative amounts of the other ingredients. Preferred tonicity agents include
 5 polyhydric sugar alcohols, preferably trihydric or higher sugar alcohols, such as glycerin, erythritol,
   arabitol, xylitol, sorbitol and mannitol.
                Additional excipients include agents which can serve as one or more of the following: (1)
   bulking agents, (2) solubility enhancers, (3) stabilizers and (4) and agents preventing denaturation or
   adherence to the container wall.          Such excipients include: polyhydric sugar alcohols (enumerated
10 above); amino acids such as alanine, glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, lysine,
   ornithine, leucine, 2-phenylalanine, glutamic acid, threonine, etc.; organic sugars or sugar alcohols
   such as sucrose, lactose, lactitol, trehalose, stachyose, mannose, sorbose, xylose, ribose, ribitol,
   myoinisitose, myoinisitol, galactose, galactitol, glycerol, cyclitols (e.g., inositol), polyethylene
   glycol; sulfur containing reducing agents, such as urea, glutathione, thioctic acid, sodium
15 thioglycolate, thioglycerol, a.-monothioglycerol and sodium thio sulfate; low molecular weight
   proteins such as human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, gelatin or other immunoglobulins;
   hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; monosaccharides (e.g., xylose, mannose,
   fructose, glucose; disaccharides (e.g., lactose, maltose, sucrose); trisaccharides such as raffinose; and
   polysaccharides such as dextrin or dextran.
20              Non-ionic surfactants or detergents (also known as "wetting agents") are present to help
   solubilize the therapeutic agent as well as to protect the therapeutic protein against agitation-induced
   aggregation, which also permits the formulation to be exposed to shear surface stress without causing
   denaturation of the active therapeutic protein or antibody. Non-ionic surfactants are present in a
   range of about 0.05 mg/ml to about 1.0 mg/ml, preferably about 0.07 mg/ml to about 0.2 mg/ml.
25               Suitable non-ionic surfactants include polysorbates (20, 40, 60, 65, 80, etc.), polyoxamers
   (184, 188, etc.), PLURONIC polyols, TRITON, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoethers (TWEEN
   20, TWEEN-80, etc.), lauromacrogol 400, polyoxyl 40 stearate, polyoxyethylene hydrogenated
   castor oil 10, 50 and 60, glycerol monostearate, sucrose fatty acid ester, methyl celluose and
   carboxymethyl cellulose. Anionic detergents that can be used include sodium lauryl sulfate, dioctyle
30 sodium sulfosuccinate and dioctyl sodium sulfonate.              Cationic detergents include benzalkonium
   chloride or benzethonium chloride.
                 In order for the formulations to be used for in vivo administration, they must be sterile. The
   formulation may be rendered sterile by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.                  The
   therapeutic compositions herein generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for
                                                           97

   example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection
   needle.
                The route of administration is in accordance with known and accepted methods, such as by
   single or multiple bolus or infusion over a long period of time in a suitable manner, e.g., injection or
 5 infusion by subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intraarterial, intralesional or
   intraarticular routes, topical administration, inhalation or by sustained release or extended-release
   means.
                 The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the
   particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not
10 adversely affect each other. Alternatively, or in addition, the composition may comprise a cytotoxic
   agent, cytokine or growth inhibitory agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in
   amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.
                The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by
   coascervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or
15 gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug
   delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and
   nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical
   Sciences 18th edition, supra.
                 Stability of the proteins and antibodies described herein may be enhanced through the use of
20 non-toxic "water-soluble polyvalent metal salts". Examples include Ca2 , Mg2 l, Zn2 , Fe2 , Fe'+,
   Cu2 +, Sn 2 , Sn 4", Al2 and Al3 . Example anions that can form water soluble salts with the above
   polyvalent metal cations include those formed from inorganic acids and/or organic acids.             Such
   water-soluble salts have a solubility in water (at 20'C) of at least about 20 mg/ml, alternatively at
   least about 100 mg/ml, alternatively at least about 200 mg/ml.
25               Suitable inorganic acids that can be used to form the "water soluble polyvalent metal salts"
   include hydrochloric, acetic, sulfuric, nitric, thiocyanic and phosphoric acid. Suitable organic acids
   that can be used include aliphatic carboxylic acid and aromatic acids. Aliphatic acids within this
   definition may be defined as saturated or unsaturated C2 -9 carboxylic acids (e.g., aliphatic mono-, di
   and tri-carboxylic acids).          For example, exemplary monocarboxylic acids within this definition
30 include the saturated C 2-9 monocarboxylic acids acetic, proprionic, butyric, valeric, caproic, enanthic,
   caprylic pelargonic and capryonic, and the unsaturated C2 -9 monocarboxylic acids acrylic, propriolic
   methacrylic, crotonic and isocrotonic acids. Exemplary dicarboxylic acids include the saturated C2 -9
   dicarboxylic acids malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic and pimelic, while unsaturated C2 -9 dicarboxylic
   acids include maleic, fumaric, citraconic and mesaconic acids. Exemplary tricarboxylic acids include
35 the saturated C2-9 tricarboxylic acids tricarballylic and 1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid. Additionally,
                                                           98
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   the carboxylic acids of this definition may also contain one or two hydroxyl groups to form hydroxy
   carboxylic acids.                Exemplary hydroxy carboxylic acids include glycolic, lactic, glyceric, tartronic,
   malic, tartaric and citric acid. Aromatic acids within this definition include benzoic and salicylic
   acid.
 5               Commonly employed water soluble polyvalent metal salts which may be used to help
   stabilize the encapsulated polypeptides of this invention include, for example: (1) the inorganic acid
   metal salts of halides (e.g., zinc chloride, calcium chloride), sulfates, nitrates, phosphates and
   thiocyanates; (2) the aliphatic carboxylic acid metal salts (e.g., calcium acetate, zinc acetate, calcium
   proprionate, zinc glycolate, calcium lactate, zinc lactate and zinc tartrate); and (3) the aromatic
10 carboxylic acid metal salts of benzoates (e.g., zinc benzoate) and salicylates.
                 E.            Methods of treatment:
                 For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an active agent, will
   depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease,
15 whether the agent is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the
   patient's clinical history and response to the agent, and the discretion of the attending physician. The
   agent is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments.
                In a particular embodiment, the invention relates to costimulation resulting from attenuating
   signaling through PD-1, specifically by the application of PD-Li antibodies that prevent binding to
20 PD-I and/or B7.1, as well to the therapeutic treatment of T-cell dysfunctional disorders.
                               I.       Infections
                 PD-i and its ligands ("PD-1:PD-L") plays an important role in regulating immune defenses
   against pathogens that cause acute and chronic infections. PD-i:PD-L signaling plays a key role in
25 regulating the balance between an effective antimicrobial immune defense and immune-mediated
   tissue damage.               For example, while PD-i knock-out mice clear adenovirus infection more rapidly
   than their wild type counterparts, they develop more severe hepatocellular injury. Iwai et al., J. Exp.
   Med. 198: 39-50 (2003). In a mouse model of herpes stromal keratitis, blocking anti-PD-Li antibody
   exacerbated keratitis, increasing HSV-I specific effector CD4 T cell expansion and IFN-y production
30 and survival. Jun et al., FEBS Lett. 579: 6259-64 (2005).
                Microorganisms that cause chronic infection have exploited the PD-i:PD-L signaling
   pathway to evade the host immune responses that results in chronic infections. Viruses that cause
   chronic infection can render virus-specific T cells non-functional and thereby silence the antiviral T
   cell response. Barber et al., Nature 439: 682-87 (2006); Wherry et al., J. Virol. 78: 5535-45 (2004).
35 Exhaustion of T cells or anergy, of CD8* T cells is an important reason for ineffective viral control
                                                               99

   during chronic infections and is characteristic of chronic LCMV infections in mice as well as HIV,
   HBV, HCV and HTLV infection in human and SIV infection in primates.               There appears to be a
   hierarchical, progressive loss of function within the phenotype of exhausted virus-specific CD8* T
   cells, with cytotoxicity and IL-2 production lost first, followed by effector cytokine production.
 5               PD-i is upregulated upon activation, and expression is maintained at a high level by
   exhausted CD8* T cells in mice with LCMV chronic infection. Barber et al., supra. Administration
   of antibodies that blocked PD-1: PD-Li binding resulted in enhanced T cell responses and a
   substantial reduction in viral burden. In persistently infected mice with ineffective CD4* TH response,
   blockade of PD-i:PD-Li restored CD8* T cells from an dysfunctional state resulting in proliferation,
10 secretion of cytokines, killing of infected cells, and decreased viral load, strongly suggesting a
   therapeutic approach for the treatment of chronic viral infections.
                As a result of the role of PD-i:PD-L in LCMV, strong interest has been shown in targeting
   this pathway to the treatment of chronic infection in humans.          PD-i expression is high on HIV
   specific [Petrovas et al., J. Exp. Med. 203: 2281-92 (2006); Day et al., Nature 443: 350-54 (2006);
15 Traumann et al., Nat. Med. 12: 1198-202 (2006)], HBV-specific [Boettler et al., J. Virol. 80: 3532-40
   (2006); Boni et al., J. Virol. 8i: 4215-25 (2007)], and HCV-specific T cells [Urbani et al., J. Virol.
   80: 11398-403 (2006)].             PD-Li is also upregulated on peripheral blood CD14* monocytes and
   myeloid DC's in patients with chronic HBV infection [Chen et al., J. Immunol. i78: 6634-41 (2007);
   Geng et al., J. Viral Hepat. 13: 725-33 (2006)], and on CD14+ cells and T cells in HIV patients
20 [Trabattoni et al., Blood 101: 2514-20 (2003)]. Blocking PD-i:PD-Li interactions in vitro reverses
   the exhaustion of HIV-specific, HBV-specific, HCV-specific and SIV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T
   cells and restores proliferation and cytokine production. Petrovas et al., J. Exp. Med. 203: 2281-92
   (2006); Day et al., supra; Trautmann et al., supra; Boni et al., supra; Urbani et al., supra; Velu et
   al., J. Virol. 8i: 5819-28 (2007).
25               The degree of PD-i expression may also be a useful diagnostic marker on virus-specific
   CD8* T cells to indicate the degree of T cell exhaustion and disease severity. The level of PD-i
   expression on HIV-specific CD8* T cells correlates with viral load, declining CD4* counts, and
   decreased capacity of CD8* T cells to prolifeate in response to HIV antigen in vitro. Corresponding
   to in vivo observations, there is a direct correlation between between PD-i expression on HIV
30 specific CD4* T cells and viral load. D'Souza et al., J. Immunol. i79: 1979-87 (2007). Long-term
   nonprogressors have functional HIV-specific memory CD8* T cells with markedly lower PD-i
   expression, in contrast to typical progressors who express significantly upregulated PD-1, which
   correlates with reduced CD4+ T cell number, decreased CD4* T cell number, decreased HIV-specific
   effector memory CD8* T cell function, and elevated plasma viral load. Zhang et al., Blood 109:
35 4671-78 (2007).
                                                          100

                The PD-i:PD-L pathway has also been implicated in the chronicity of bacterial infections.
   Helicobacterpylori causes chronic gastritis and gastroduodenal ulcers and is a risk factor for the
   development of gastric cancer. During a H. pylori infection, T cell responses are insufficient to clear
   infection, leading to persistent infection. Following exposure to H. pylori in vitro or in vivo, PD-Li
 5 is upregulated on gastric epithelial cells. Gastric epithelial cells express MHC class II molecules and
   are thought to play in important APC function during H. pylori infection. Anti-PD-LI antibodies that
   block PD-i to PD-Li interaction enhance T cell proliferation and IL-2 production in cultures of
   gastric epithelial cells explosed to H. pylori and CD4 T cells. Blocking PD-LI with either antibodies
   or siRNA prevented the generation of the regulatory T cells, suggesting that PD-Li may promote T
10 cell suppression and persisting infections by controling the dynamic between regulatory and effector
   T cells during H. pylori infection. Beswick et al., Infect. Immun. 75: 4334-41 (2007).
                 Parasitic worms have also exploited the PD-i:PD-Li pathway to induce macrophages that
   suppress the immune response. During Taenia crassiceps (i.e., tapeworm) infections in mice, PD-1
   and PD-L2 are upregulated on activated macrophages, and CD4+ T cells express PD-1. Blockade of
15 PD-1, PD-Li or PD-L2 significantly decreased suppression of in vitro T cell proliferation by
   macrophages from tapeworm infected mice.           Terrazas et al., Int. J. Parasitol.35: 1349-58 (2005).
   During Shistosoma mansoni infection in mice, macrophages express high levels of PD-Li and more
   modest levels of PD-L2. Anti-PD-Li removed the ability of these macrophages to suppress T cell
   proliferation in vitro, whereas anti-PD-L2 had no effect. PD-Li expression on macrophages from
20 infected mice declines after 12 weeks of infection, correlating with a break in T cell anergy. Smith et
   al., J. Immunol. 173: 1240-48 (2004).
                              2.      Tumor Immunity
                 Empirical evidence for tumor immunity includes (i) the observance of spontaneous
25 remission, (ii) the presence of detectable, but ineffective host immune response to tumors, (iii) the
   increased prevalence of primary and secondary malignancies in immunodeficient patients, (iv) the
   detection of increased levels of antibodies and T-lymphocytes in tumor patients, and (v) the
   observation that test animals can be immunized against various types of tumors.
                 Studies have shown that most human tumors express tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) that
30 can be recognized by T cells and thus are potentially capable of inducing immune response. Boon et
   al., Immunol. Today 16:334-336 (1995). Early phase clinical trials have been initiated by vaccinating
   cancer patients with TAA or professional antigen-presenting cells pulsed with TAA.          Dudley et al.,
   Science 298: 850-854 (2002); Gajewski et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 7: 895s-90Is (2001); Marincola et
   al., Adv. Immunol. 74: 181-273 (2000); Peterson et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 21: 2342-2348 (2003).
35 Induction of tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells has been achieved in many of these trials.
                                                        101
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   Mackensen et al., Eur. Cytokine Netw 10: 329-336 (1999); Peterson et al., supra. Adoptive transfer
   of tumor antigen-specific T cells into patients also has been pursued and has revealed homing of the
   expanded cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to tumor sites.                Meidenbauer et al., J. Immunol. 170:
   2161-2169 (2003). However, despite tumor infiltration of immune effector cells, tumor growth was
 5 seldom controlled.
                It is well established that the tumor microenvironment can protect tumor cells from immune
   destruction. Ganss et al., Cancer Res. 58: 4673-4681 (1998); Singh et al., J. Exp. Med. 175: 139-146
   (1992). Soluble factors, as well as membrane-bound molecules including transforming growth factor
   P   (TGF-$), interleukin (IL)-10, prostaglandin E 2, FASL, CTLA-4 ligands, tumor necrosis factor
10 related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-LI, aka B7
   HI) have been found to be expressed by tumors and are believed to mediate immune evasion. Thus,
   blockade of this negative immune regulatory signals on tumor cells is a promising approach to
   enhance tumor-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in vivo.
                 PD-LI expression on many tumors is a component to this suppression and may act in concert
15 with other immunosuppressive signals. PD-LI negatively regulates T-cell receptor signaling. PD-LI
   expression has been shown in situ on a wide varity of solid tumors, including breast, lung, colon,
   ovarian, melanoma, bladder, liver, salivary, stomach, gliomas, thyroid, thymic, epithelian, head and
   neck cancers.              Brown et al., J. Immunol. 170: 1257-66 (2003); Dong et al., Nat. Med. 8: 793-800

    19-24 (2006).
                Immunological staining also reveals the expression of PD-i:PD-L expression on various
25 cancers.
                Interestingly, cancer has also been characterized as a chronic inflammatory disease.
   Coussens et al., Nature 420: 860-867 (2002).             While up to 15% of cancers worldwide have a direct
   infectious origin [Kuper et al., J. Intern. Med. 248: 171-183 (2000)], many human tumors are related
   to chronic irritation and inflammation. Zou et al., Ntu. Rev. Cancer 5: 263-274 (2005).
30               Studies relating to to PD-Li expression on tumors to disease outcome show that PD-Li
   expression strongly correlates with unfavorable prognosis in kidney, ovarian, bladder, breast, gastric,
   and pancreatic cancer, but perhaps not small cell lung cancer. Hamanishi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.
   Sci. USA 104: 3360-65 (2007), Inman et al., Cancer 109: 1499-505 (2007), Konishi et al., Clin.

   USA 101: 17174-79 (2004); Wu et al., Acta Histochem. 108: 19-24 (2006). In addition, these studies
   suggest that higher levels of PD-LI expression on tumors may facilitate advancement of tumor stage
   and invasion into deeper tissue structures.
                The PD-i:PD-L pathway may also play a role in hematologic malignancies. PD-i or PD-Li
 5 are rarely expressed B cell malignancies, but PD-L2 is overexpressed in mantle cell malignancies.
   Brown et al., supra; Rosenwald et al., J. Exp. Med. 198: 851-62 (2003).                 PD-Li is expressed on
   multiple myeloma cells, but not on normal plasma cells. T cell expansion in response to myeloma
   cells is enhanced in vitro by PD-Li blockade.                Liu et al., Blood 110: 296-304 (2007).  PD-Li is
   expressed on some primary T cell lymphomas, particularly anaplastic large cell T lymphomas, and
10 PD-Li is expressed on the associated follicular dendritic cell network. Dorfman et al., Am. J. Surg.
   Pathol. 30: 802-10 (2006).               Microarray analysis further suggests that tumor-associated T cells are
   responding to PD-i signals in situ in Hodgkin lymphoma.                   Chenmitz et al., Blood 110: 3226-33
   (2007). PD-i and PD-Li are expressed on CD4* T cells in HTLV-1 mediated adult T cell leukemia
   and lymphoma.                  Shimauchi et al., Int. J. Cancer 121: 2585-90 (2007).    These tumor cells are
15 hyporesponsive to TCR signals, and PD-i blockade increased their expression of TNF-a., but not
   IFN-7.        Studies in animal models demonstrate that PD-Li expression on tumors inhibits T cell
   activation and lysis of tumor cells and in some cases leads to increased tumor-specific T cell death.
   Dong et al., Nat. Med. 8: 793-800 (2006); Hirano et al., CancerRes. 65: 1089-96 (2005).
                 Thus, the suppression of signaling through PD-Li with the anti-PD-Li antibodies of the
20 invention, so as to enhance T cell function, shows promise to attenuate tumor immunity, and as a
   result, can be effective treatment for cancer.
                F.             Combination Therapies
                 The method of the invention can be combined with known methods of treatment chronic
25 infection or cancer, either as combined or additional treatment steps or as additional components of a
   therapeutic formulation.
                               1.      Cancer:
                 Enhancing the host's immune function to combat tumors is the subject of increasing interest.
30 Conventional methods include (i) APC enchancement, such as (a) injection into the tumor of DNA
   encoding foreign MHC alloantigens, or (b) transfecting biopsied tumor cells with genes that increase
   the probability of immune antigen recognition (e.g., immune stimulatory cytokines, GM-CSF, co
   stimulatory molecules B7. 1, B7.2) of the tumor, (iii) adoptive cellular immunotherapy, or treatment
   with activated tumor-specific T-cells. Adoptive cellular immunotherapy includes isolating tumor
35 infiltrating host T-lymphocytes, expanding the population in vitro, such as through stimulation by IL
                                                               103
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   2 or tumor or both. Additionally, isolated T-cells that are dysfunctional may be also be activated by
   in vitro application of the anti-PD-Li antibodies of the invention. T-cells that are so-activated may
   then be readministered to the host.
                 Traditional therapies        for cancer include the following:   (i) radiation therapy (e.g.,
 5 radiotherapy, X-ray therapy, irradiation) or the use of ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink
   tumors.         Radiation therapy can be administered either externally via external beam radiotherapy
   (EBRT) or internally via brachytherapy; (ii) chemotherapy, or the application of cytoxic drug which
   generally affect rapidly dividing cells; (iii) targeted therapies, or agents which specifically affect the
   deregulated proteins of cancer cells (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib, gefitinib; monoclonal
10 antibodies, photodynamic therapy); (iv) immunotherapy, or enhancement of the host's immune
   response (e.g., vaccine);              (v) hormonal therapy, or blockaide of hormone (e.g., when tumor is
   hormone sensitive), (vi) angiogenesis inhibitor, or blockaide of blood vessel formation and growth,
   and (vii) palliativecare, or treatment directed to improving the quality of care to reduce pain, nausea,
   vomiting, diarrhea and hemorrhage. Pain medication such as morphine and oxycodone, anti-emetics
15 such as ondansetron and aprepitant, can permit more aggressive treatment regimens.
                  In the treatment of cancer, any of the previously described conventional treatments for the
   treatment of cancer immunity may be conducted, prior, subsequent or simultaneous with the
   administration of the anti-PD-LI antibodies of the invention. Additionally, the anti-PD-LI antibodies
   of the invention may be adminstrered prior, subsequent or simultaneous with conventional cancer
20 treatments, such as the adminstration of tumor-binding antibodies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies, toxin
   conjugated monoclonal antibodies) and/or the administration of chemotherapeutic agents.
                              2.      Infection:
                 In the treatment of infection (e.g., acute and/or chronic), administration of the anti-PD-Li
25 antibodies of the invention can be combined with conventional treatments in addition to or in lieu of
   stimulating natural host immune defenses to infection. Natural host immune defenses to infection
   include, but are not limited to inflammation, fever, antibody-mediated host defense, T-lymphocyte
   mediated host defenses, including lymphokine secretion and cytotoxic T-cells (especially during viral
   infection), complement mediated lysis and opsonization (facilitated phagocytosis), and phagocytosis.
30 The ability of the anti-PD-LI antibodies of the invention to reactivate dysfunctional T-cells would be
   particularly useful to treat chronic infections, in particular those in which cell-mediated immunity is
   critical for complete recovery.
                                                             104
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

                                      a.    bacteria
                 For infections resulting from a bacterial infection, the anti-PD-LI antibodies of the invention
   may be combined by administration simultaneous with, prior or subsequent to standard therapies for
   treating bacterial infection. Bacterial infections are most commonly treated today with antibacterial
 5 antibiotics, but serum containing pathogen-specific antibodies from immunized hosts can also be
   effective.
                 Bacteria that are pathogenic as a result of the secretion of toxins, (toxogenic bacteria),
   vaccination with inactive toxin and/or the administration of therapeutic agents that block the toxicity
   of the toxins are usually effective (e.g., polyclonal serum, antibodies, antibiotics etc.).              These
10 organisms include Clostridium spp., bacillus spp., Corynebacteriumspp., Vibrio chloerae, Bordetella
   pertussis, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp.               Gram negative bacteria that also typically
   respond to such traditional therapies include Enterobacteria (E.g., Escherichia,Klebsiella, Proteus,
   Yersinia, Erwina), Salmonella, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Encapsulated bacteria, which are
   resistant to phagocytosis and opsonization, and thus often prevent a more significant challenge to
15 immune clearance include: Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus spp. Neisseria spp., Klebsiella spp. and
   Bacterioidesfragillis.
                 Bacteria that evade host defenses by invading cells so as to evade serum antibody and
   complement post a particular challenge.               The clearance of these infections is almost entirely
   dependent upon T-lymphocyte mediated immunity, and are especially prone to becoming chronic
20 infections.             Specific examples include Salmonella (S. typhi, S. choleraesuis, S. enteritidis),
   Legionella spp., Listeria spp., Brucella spp. and Mycobacterium, including M. tuberculosis, M.
   avium and M. leprae.
                 Spirochetes, including Treponema spp., Borrelia spp. and Leptospira spp. are bacteria that
   cause persistent and latent infections.            Treponema palladium, the pathogen causing the disease
25 syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease which can have severe pathological consequences if left
   untreated. The disease progresses through distinct stages. The initial clinical stage is an ulcer or
   chancre at the site treponemal inoculation. Following this is a period of spirochetemia and metastatic
   distribution of microorganisms that continues, including repeating cycles of infection and resolution
   in a condition known as secondary syphilis. Following the resolution of secondary syphilis, the
30 disease enters an asymptomatic latency period which may conclude in tertiary syphilis, which is a
   serious and often fatal condition.            Tertiary syphilis may manifest in (i) the heart as aortisis with
   aneurysis formuation and secondary aortic value insufficiency, (ii) central nervous system (tabes
   dorsalis, general paresis), (iii) eyes (interstitial keratitis) or (iv) ears (nerve deafness). Non-venereal
   forms resemble the clinical manifestations of the venereal forms, but are transmitted primary by
                                                             105
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

   direct contact and poor hygiene.                  They include yaws (T. pallidum subp. pertenue,) pinta (T.
   carateum) and bejel (T. pallidum subsp. endemicum).
                Treatments for syphilis include penicillin (E.g., penicillin G.), tetracycline, doxycycline
   ceftriaxone and azithromycin.                  The anti-PD-Li    antibodies of the invention would be most
 5 advantaneously administered to treat the latent infection period.
                 Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi is transmitted into humans through tick bites.
   The disease manifests initially as a localized rash, followed by flu-like symptoms including malaise,
   fever, headache, stiff neck and arthralgias.                 Later manifestations can include migratory and
   polyarticular            arthritis,  neurologic   and cardiac involvement    with cranial  nerve palsies  and
10 radiculopathy, myocarditis and arrhythmias.                  Some cases of Lyme disease become persistent,
   resulting in irreversible damage analogous to tertiary syphilis.
                 Current therapy for Lyme disease includes primarily the administration of antibiotics.
   Antibiotic-resistent strains may be treated with hydroxychloroquine or methotrexate.                Antibiotic
   refractory patients with neuropathic pain can be treated with gabapentin.                 Minocycline may be
15 helpful in late/chronic Lyme disease with neurological or other inflammatory manifestations. The
   anti-PD-Li antibodies would be most advantaneously administered to treat the latent infection
   period.
                 Other forms of borreliois, such as those resulting from B. recurentis,B. hermsii, B. turicatae,
   B. parikeri., B. hispanica, B. duttonii and B. persica, as well leptospirosis (E.g., L. interrogans),
20 typically resolve spontaneously unless blood titers reach concentrations to cause intrahepatic
   obstruction.
                                       b.      virus
                 For infections resulting from viral causes, the anti-PD-LI antibodies of the invention may be
25 combined by application simulatenous with, prior to or subsequent to application of standard
   therapies for treating viral infections.            Such standard therapies vary depending upon type of virus,
   although in almost all cases, adminstration of human serum containing antitibodies (e.g., IgA, IgG)
   specific to the virus can be effective.
30                                             1) Influenza
                Influenza infection results in fever, cough, myalgia, headache and malaise, which often occur
   in seasonal epidemics. Influenza is also associated with a number of postinfectious disorders, such as
   encephalitis, myopericarditis, Goodpasture's syndrome, and Reye's syndrome. Influenza infection
   also suppresses normal pulmonary antibacterial defenses, such that patient's recovering from
35 influenza have an increased risk of developing bacterial pneumonia.
                                                               106
   10250257_1 (GHMatters) P86802.AU.2

                Influenza viral surface proteins show marked antigenic variation, resulting from mutation and
   recombination. Thus, cytolytic T lymphocytes are the host's primary vehicle for the elimination of
   virus after infection. Influenza is classified into three primary types: A, B and C. Influenza A is
   unique in that it infects both humans and many other animals (e.g., pigs, horses, birds and seals) and
 5 is the principal cause of pandemic influenza. Also, when a cell is infected by two different influenza
   A strains, the segmented RNA genomes of two two parental virus types mix during replication to
   create a hybrid replicant, resulting in new epidemic strains. Influenza B does not replicate in animals
   and thus has less genetic variation and influenza C has only a single serotype.
                 Most conventional therapies are palliatives of the symptoms resulting from infection, while
10 the host's immune response actually clears the disease. However, certain strains (e.g., influenza A)
   can cause more serious illness and death.               Influenza A may be treated both clinically and
   prophylactically by the administration of the cyclic amines inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine,
   which inhibit viral replication.         However, the clinical utility of these drugs is limited due to the
   relatively high incidence of adverse reactions, their narrow anti-viral spectrum (influenza A only),
15 and the propensity of the virus to become resistant. The administration of serum IgG antibody to the
   major influenza surface proteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase can prevent pulmonary infection,
   whereas mucosal IgA is required to prevent infection of the upper respiratory tract and trachea. The
   most effective current treatment for influenza is vaccination with the administration of virus
   inactivated with formalin or       P -propiolactone.
20                                        2)       Measles virus
                After an incubation of 9-11 days, hosts infected with the measles virus develope fever,
   cough, coryza and conjunctivitis.          Within 1-2 days, an erythematous, maculopapular rash develop,
   which quickly spreads over the entire body. Because infection also suppresses cellular immunity, the
   host is at greater risk for developing bacterial superinfections, including otitis media, pneumonia and
25 postinfectious encephalomyelitis.           Acute infection is associated with significant morbidity and
   mortality, especially in malnourished adolescents.
                Treatment for measles includes the passive administration of pooled human IgG, which can
   prevent infection in non-immune subjects, even if given up to one week after exposure. However,
   prior immunization with live, attenuated virus is the most effective treatment and prevents disease in
30 more than 95% of those immunized. As there is one serotype of this virus, a single immunization or
   infection typically results in protection for life from subsequent infection.
                In a small proportion of infected hosts, measles can develop into SSPE, which is a chronic
   progressive neurologic disorder resulting from a persistent infection of the central nervous system.
   SSPE is caused by clonal variants of measles virus with defects that interfere with virion assembly
                                                           107

   and budding.               For these patients, reactivation of T-cells with the anti-PD-Li antibodies of the
   invention so as to facilitate viral clearance would be desirable.
                                              3)      Hepatitis B virus
 5              Hepatitis B virus (HB-V) is the most infectious known bloodborne pathogen. It is a major
   cause of acute and chronic heptatis and hepatic carcinoma, as well as life-long, chronic infection.
   Following infection, the virus replicates in hepatocytes, which also then shed the surface antigen
   HBsAg.           The detection of excessive levels of HBsAg in serum is used a standard method for
   diagnosing a hepatitis B infection. An acute infection may resolve or it can develop into a chronic
10 persistent infection.
                 Current treatments for chronic HBV include a-inteferon, which increases the expression of
   class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) on the surface of hepatocytes, thereby facilitating their
   recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes.                    Additionally, the nucleoside analogs ganciclovir,
   famciclovir and lamivudine have also shown some efficacy in the treatment of HBV infection in in
15 clinical trial.            Additional treatments for HBV include pegylated a.-interferon, adenfovir, entecavir
   and telbivudine. While passive immunity can be conferred through parental administration of anti
   HBsAg serum antibodies, vaccination with inactivated or recombinant HBsAg also confers resistance
   to infection.             The anti-PD-Li antibodies of the invention may be combined with conventional
   treatments for hepatitis B infections for therapeutic advantage.
20
                                              4)      Hepatitis C virus
                Hepatitis C virus (HC-V) infection may lead to a chronic form of hepatitis, resulting in
   cirrosis. While symptoms are similar to infections resulting from Hepatitis B, in distinct contrast to
   HB-V, infected hosts can be asymptomatic for 10-20 years. Treatment for HC-V infection includes
25 the administration of a combination of a.-interferon and ribavirin. A promising potential therapy for
   HC-V infection is the protease inhibitor telaprevir (VX-960). Additional treatments include: anti
   PD-i antibody (MDX-1106, Medarex), bavituximab (an antibody that binds anionic phospholipid
   phosphatidylserine in a B2-glycoprotein I dependent manner, Peregrine Pharmaceuticals), anti-HPV
   viral coat protein E2 antibod(y)(ies) (E.g., ATL 6865 - Ab68 + Ab65, XTL Pharmaceuticals) and
30 Civacir* (polyclonal anti-HCV human immune globulin).                      The anti-PD-Li   antibodies of the
   invention may be combined with one or more of these treatments for hepatitis C infections for
   therapeutic advantage.
                Protease, polymerase and NS5A inhibitors which may be used in combination with the anti
   PD-Li antibodies of the invention to specifically treat Hepatitis C infection include the following

                                               5)     Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
                HIV attacks CD4+ cells, including T-lymphocytes,                monocyte-macrophages,  follicular
   dendritic cells and Langerhan's cells, and CD4+ helper/inducer cells are depleted. As a result, the
   host acquires a severe defect in cell-mediated immunity. Infection with HIV results in AIDS in at
 5 least 50% of inviduals, and is transmitted via sexual contact, administration of infected blood or
   blood products, artificial insemination with infected semen, exposure to blood-containing needles or
   syringes and transmission from an infected mother to infant during childbirth.
                A host infected with HIV may be asymptomatic, or may develop an acute illness that
   resembling mononucleosis - fever, headache, sore throat, malaise and rash.              Symptoms can progress
10 to progressive immune dysfunction, including persistent fever, night sweats, weight loss, unexplained
   diarrhea, eczema, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, herpes zoster, oral candidiasis and oral hary
   leukoplakia. Opportunistic infections by a host of parasites are common in patients whose infections
   develop into AIDS.
                Treatments for HIV include antiviral therapies including including nucleoside analogs,
15 zidovudine (AST) either alone or in combination with didanosine or zalcitabine, dideoxyinosine,
   dideoxycytidine,               lamidvudine, stavudine; reverse transcriptive  inhibitors such as delavirdine,
   nevirapine, loviride, and proteinase inhibitors such as saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir and nelfinavir.
   The anti-PD-Li antibodies of the invention may be combined with conventional treatments for HIV
   infections for therapeutic advantage.

                                               6)     Cytomegalovirus
                 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is often associated with persistent, latent and recurrent
   infection. CMV infects and remains latent in monocytes and granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells.
   The clinical symptoms of CMV include mononucleosis-like symptoms (i.e., fever, swollen glands,
25 malaise), and a tendancy to develop allergic skin rashes to antibiotics. The virus is spread by direct
   contact. The virus is shed in the urine, saliva, semen and to a lesser extent in other body fluids.
   Transmission can also occur from an infected mother to her fetus or newborn and by blood
   transfusion and organ transplants. CMV infection results in general impairment of cellular immunity,
   characterized by impaired blastogenic responses to nonspecific mitogens and specific CMV antigens,
30 diminished cytotoxic ability and elevation of CD8 lymphocyte number of CD4+ lymphocytes.
                Treatments of CMV infection include the anti-virals ganciclovir, foscarnet and cidovir, but
   these druges are typically only prescribed in immunocompromised patients.                     The anti-PD-Li
   antibodies of the invention may be combined with conventional treatments for cytomegalovirus
   infections for therapeutic advantage.

                                        7)      Epstein-Barr Virus
                Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can establish persistent and latent infections and primarily attacks
   B cells.        Infection with EBV results in the clinical condition of infectious mononucleosis, which
   includes fever, sore throat, often with exudate, generalized lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.
 5 Hepatitis is also present, which can develop into jaundice.
                While typical treatments for EBV infections are palliative of symptoms, EBV is associated
   with the development of certain cancers such as Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal cancer.
   Thus, clearance of viral infection before these complications result would be of great benefit.       The
   anti-PD-Li antibodies of the invention may be combined with conventional treatments for Epstein
10 Barr virus infections for therapeutic advantage.
                                        8)      Herpes virus
                Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is transmitted by direct contact with an infected host. A direct
   infection may be asymptomatic, but typically result in blisters containing infectious particles. The
15 disease manifests as cycles of active periods of disease, in which lesions appear and disappear as the
   viral latently infect the nerve ganglion for subsequent outbreaks.          Lesions may be on the face,
   genitals, eyes and/or hands. In some case, an infection can also cause encephalitis.
                Treatments for herpes infections are directed primarily to resolving the symptomatic
   outbreaks, and include systemic antiviral medicines such as: acyclovir (e.g., Zovirax), valaciclovir,
20 famciclovir, penciclovir, and topical medications such as docosanol (Abreva), tromantadine and
   zilactin. The clearance of latent infections of herpes would be of great clinical benefit. The anti-PD
   LI antibodies of the invention may be combined with conventional treatments for herpes virus
   infections for therapeutic advantage.
25                                      9)      HTLV
                Human T-lymphotrophic virus (HTLV-1, HTLV-2) is transmitted via sexual contact, breast
   feeding or exposure to contaminated blood. The virus activates a subset of TH cells called Thi cells,
   resulting in their overproliferation and overproduction of Thi related cytokines (e.g., IFN-y and TNF
   a).      This in turn results in a suppression of Th2 lymphocytes and reduction of Th2 cytokine
30 production (e.g., IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13), causing a reduction in the ability of an infected host to
   mount an adequate immune response to invading organisms requiring a Th2-dependent response for
   clearance (e.g., parasitic infections, production of mucosal and humoral antibodies).
                HTLV infections cause lead to opportunistic infections resulting in bronchiectasis, dermatitis
   and superinfections with Staphylococcus spp. and Strongyloides spp. resulting in death from
35 polymicrobial sepsis. HTLV infection can also lead directly to adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and
                                                         111

   progressive demyelinating upper motor neuron disease known as HAM/TSP.                       The clearance of
   HTLV latent infections would be of great clinical benefit.                  The anti-PD-Li antibodies of the
   invention may be combined with conventional treatments for HTLV infections for therapeutic
   advantage.
 5
                                               10)      HPV
                 Human papilloma virus (HPV) primarily affects keratinocytes and occurs in two forms:
   cutaneous and genital.                Transmission it believed to occurs through direct contact and/or sexual
   activity. Both cutaneous and genital HPV infection, can result in warts and latent infections and
10 sometimes recurring infections, which are controlled by host immunity which controls the symptoms
   and blocks the appearance of warts, but leaves the host capable of transmitting the infection to others.
                 Infection with HPV can also lead to certain cancers, such as cervical, anal, vulvar, penile and
   oropharynial cancer. There are no known cures for HPV infection, but current treatment is topical
   application of Imiquimod, which stimulates the immune system to attack the affected area.                  The
15 clearance of HPV latent infections would be of great clinical benefit. The anti-PD-Li antibodies of
   the invention may be combined with conventional treatments for HPV infections for therapeutic
   advantage.
                                       c.      fungus
20               Fungal infections, or mycoses, can result as either a primary infection or as opportunistic
   colonization of hosts with compromised immune systems by endogenous flora. Immunity to mycoses
   is principally cellular, involving neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes and probably natural killer
   (NK) cells.             Mycoses are typically not susceptible to direct killing by antibody and complement.
   Systemic            invasive       mycoses    resulting   from   primary   infection  include   blastomycosis,
25 coccidioiodomycosis, histoplamosis, and paracoccidioiodmycosis.                  For chronic infections results
   from fungal infections, the anti-PD-Li antibodies of the invention may be administered prior to
   simultaneous with or subsequent to any of the conventionally known treatments for these mycoses.
                Blastomycosis, caused by Blastomyces dermatitis is inhalation-acquired and produces a
   primary pulmonary infection or hematogenously disseminated disease involving predominantly skin,
30 bones, and the male genitourinary tract. Primary exposure may be asymptomatic, or it may produce

   also associated with compromised immune such as in patients with AIDS. Conventional therapy for
   B. dermatitis infection include itraconazole, ketoconazole or intravenous injection of amphotericin B.
                 Coccidioiodmycosis, caused by Coccidioides immitis, is inhalation-acquired and can cause
35 primary pulmonary infection, progressive pulmonary disease, or hematogenously disseminated

   disease involving predominantly skin, subcutaneous tissues, bones, joints, and meninges. Primary
   exposure may be asymptomatic (60%) or associated with an influenza-like syndrome. Pneumonia,
   pleuritis, and pulmonary cavitation may occur.             Metastatic manisfestations include skin lesions,
   including nodules, ulcers, sinus tracts from deeper loci and verrucouse granulomas, bones, joints,
 5 tendon sheaths and meninges, including meningitis. The disease is also associated with compromised
   immunity such as in patients with AIDS. Treatment for coccidioidiomycosis includes ketoconazole,
   intraconazole and fluconazole, especially for long-term maintenance therapy of nonmeningial
   disease. Meningial forms are treated usually with intrathecal administration of Amphotericin B.
                Histoplasmosis, caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, is an inhalation-acquired disease of the
10 reticuloendothelial system in which tiny yeasts reside in macrophages.              It can produce primary
   pulmonary infection, progressive pulmonary disease or hematogenously disseminated disease
   involving predominantly the reticuloendothelial system, mucosal surfaces, and adrenal glands.
   Reactivation of latent infections often occur in patients with compromised immunity, such as in
   patients with AIDS. Primary exposure may be asymptomatic or associated with a flu-like syndrome,
15 including pneumonia, pleuritis, pulmonary cavitation and mediastinal adenopathy. Metastatic sites
   include the reticuloendothelial system (hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, anemia, leucopenia
   and thrombocytopenia), mucrous membranes (oronasopharnygeal ulcerations), gastrointestinal tract
   (malabsorption), and adrenal insufficiency. While most primary infections resolve spontaneously,
   when associated with compromised immunity such as in patients with AIDS, relapse is ongoing and
20 is often associated with hematogenous pneumonia, ARDS, disseminated intravascular coagulation
   (DIC), hematogenously distributed papulopustules and meningitis.            Histoplasmosis is treated with
   Amphotericin               B (especially in immunocompromised    patients acutely ill with hematogenous
   dissemination), intraconzoles and ketoconazole.
                Paracoccidioiomycosis, caused by Paracoccidioidesbrasiliensis, is an inhalation-acquired
25 mycosis that can produce primary pulmonary infection or hematogenously disseminated disease
   involving predominantly the skin, mucouse membranes, reticulendothelial system and adrenals.
   Infection may be initially asymptomatic but dormant, and then revive. Treatment of this infection
   uses ketoconazole, intraconzole and sulfonamides.
                 Systemic invasive mycoses resulting from opportunistic pathogens, which occur in
30 immunocompromised hosts, include candidiasis, cryptococcosis, aspergillossi, mucomycosis and
   pneumocystosis. By heightening immune response in a compromised immune system, the anti-PD
   LI antibodies of the invention may also have therapeutic value in the treatment of these conditions,
   especially when combined with conventional therapies.

   fumigatus, A. tereus and A. niger) and mucormycosis (caused by Rhizopus arrhizus, Rhizomuco,
    Absidia, Cunninghamella, Mortierella, Saksenaea spp.) may be treated by one or more of the
    following imidazole, ketoconazole, intraconazole, fluconazole, amphotericin B with and without
    flucytosine. Pneumocystitis (caused by penumocystis carnii) recently reclassified from protozoan to
 5  fungi is treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxole                (TMP-SMZ) and intravenous pentamidine
    isethionate, as well as dapsone, TMP-dapson, trimetrexate, clindamycin-primaquine and atovagnone.
                 Microsporidiosis          caused by Microsporidia parasites,   was recently    reclassified from
    protozoan to fungi. They are unicellular organisms which have mitosomes instead of mitochondria.
    Organisims that can cause disease in humans include: Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Encephalitozoon
10  hellem,            Encephalitozoon         intestinalis, Encephalitozoon     cuniculi,    Pleistophora    spp,

    ocularum, Brachiola vesicularum, Vittaforma corneae,Microsporidium ceylonensis, Microsporidium
    africanum, Brachiola algerae.
                 Infections are believed to be transmitted to humans from direct contact with animals,
15  contaminated water or another infected host.               After infecting host cells, the sporoplasm grows,
    dividing or forming a multinucleate plasmodium which can have complex life cycles including both
    asexual and sexual reproduction. Autoinfection by successive generations and chronic, debilitating
    diseases often characterize Microsporidial infections.
                 The clinical manifestations of the disease can vary depending on the species and the host's
20  immune status, and include conjunctivitis (e.g., V. corneae), chronic diarrhea, malabsorption and
    wasting (e.g., E. bieneusi, E. intestinalis).
                 Treatments for ocular, intestinal and disseminated microsporosis includes administration of
    albendazole. Topical application of fumagillin may also be used effectively to treat microsporidial
    keratoconjunctivitis.              Other drugs include antihelminthics (e.g., albendazole), antibiotics (e.g.,
25  fumagillin), immunomodulators (e.g., thalidomide), antiprotozoals, (e.g., metronidazole).

                  Disease resulting from parasitic disorders such as malaria, schistosomiasis and leishmaniasis
    are among the most prevalent and important health problems in developing countries. These diseases
30  pose particular challenges because they may evade host immunity through various means, including:
    1) living inside host cells (e.g., Leishmania), 2) rapidly change surface antigens (e.g., trypansomes)
    and 3) "disguising" themselves as host cells by displaying host antigens (e.g., schistosomisasis). The
    use of immunosuppressive drugs in the treatment of cancer and in conjunction with organ transplants,
    as well the global prevalence of AIDs can reactivate latent or subclinical infections from Plasmodium
35  spp., Toxoplasma spp., Leishmania spp., Cryptosporidiumspp., Trypanosoma spp. and helminths.

                 For chronic infections resulting from infections with protozoan parasites, the anti-PD-Li
    antibodies of the invention may be combined by administration in combination with, prior to or
    subsequent with standard anti-protozoan therapies.
                 Malaria, caused by parasites of genus Plasmodium (E.g., P. ovale, P. malariae, P.
 5 falciparum, P. vivax), begins the infectious cycle as a sporozite which developes in the gut of the
    female anopheline mosquito. Upon transmission into humans, these sporozites invade and multiply
    within hepatic cells without inducing an inflammatory reaction. The progeny of these organisms,
    called merozoites, then invade erythrocytic cells and initiate the clinical phase of the disease,
    typically characterized by fever and chills. In areas of the world where infection is endemic, nearly
10  all residents harbor continuous low level chronic infections of low to moderate pathogenicity, with
    increasing levels of IgG antibodies providing protection from merozoite entry into erythrocytes.
                  Currently available anti-malarial drugs for both treatment of clinical disease and prophylaxic
    include: Artemether-lumefantrine (therapy, E.g., Coartem@ and Riamet@), artesunate-amodiaquine
    (therapy),            artesunate-mefloquine       (therapy),  artesunate-Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine      (therapy),
15  atovaquone-proguanil, (therapy and prophylaxis, E.g., Malarone@), quinine (therapy), chloroquine
    (therapy         and prophylaxis),         cotrifazid (therapy and prophylaxis),     doxycycline   (therapy    and
    prophylaxis), mefloquine, (therapy and prophylaxis, E.g., Lariam@), primaquine (Therapy in P. vivax
    and P. ovale only; not for prophylaxis), proguanil (prophylaxis), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (therapy
    and prophylaxis), hydroxychloroquine, (therapy and prophylaxis, E.g., Plaquenil@)
20               Through reactivating anerigic T-cells, the anti-PD-Li antibodies of the invention may
    particularly therapeutic in aiding clearance of malarial parasites.
                  Toxoplasmosis, caused by parasites of the genus Toxoplasma, is often asymptomatic, but a
    small fraction can develop clinical disease, which can range from benign lymphadenopathy acute to
    fatal infections of the central nervous system.                The sources of infection include cysts in raw or
25  partially cooked pork or mutton and oocytes passed in feces of infected cats.                 Infection occus in
    humans usually through the gastrointestinal tract, and the protozoa can penetrate and proliferate (as
    tachyzoites) in virtually every cell of the body. These tachyzoites can produce cysts filled with
    minute slow-growing infective bodies (bradyzoites) that remain viable for long periods of time,
    resulting in a latent chronic infection.               Hosts with compromised immune systems, such as those
30  taking immunosuppressive drugs or suffering from HIV are particularly prone to suffering from
    toxicoplasmosis.
                 Medications           that are used to treat primary toxoplasmosis         include  the   following:
    pyrimethamine, both with and without an accompanying antibiotics (E.g., sulfadiazine, clindamycin,
    spiramycin and minocycline). Latent toxoplasmosis may be treated with the antibiotics atovaquone,
35  both with and without clindamycin.
                                                                 115

                Leishmaniasis, caused by by parasites of the genus Leishmania, infect macrophages of the
   skin and viscera, and is transmitted into humans through sandflies. As there is little or no specific
   serum antibody, cell-mediation immunity through activated T-cells appears to be a critical route by
   which infection is cleared.           Old World Leishmaniasis, also known as tropical sore, is caused by
 5 several species of Leishmania: L. tropica,L. major and L. aethiopica. New World Leishmaniasis is
   caused by various subspecies of L. Mexicana and L. braziliensis. These parasites induce a strong
   cell-mediated immune response, but the outcome of the clinical disease results also in part to the host
   response.          If the host mounts in a suppressed or inadequate cell-mediated response, the result is
   diffuse chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis, with little hope for spontaneous cure (E.g. L. aethiopica,L.
10 Mexicana). If the host mounts an excessive cell-mediated response, the response is a lupoid or
   recidiva leishmaniasis, with persistent nonulcerated lymphoid nodules appearing at the edge of
   primary lesions (E.g., L. tropica). Recidiva leishmaniasis can appear form 1 to 10 years after the
   initial lesion. There are two forms of the disease, cutaneous and visceral, with the cutaneous form
   manifesting in cutaneous lesions with cell mediated immunity is critical to clearance. In the visceral
15 form, cell-mediated immunity is insufficient or non-existent, and the disease manifest clinically as
   polyclonal B-cell hypergammaglobulinemia, leukopenia, splenomegaly and elevated production of
   TNF-a.
                 Miltefosine (E.g., Impavido@) and paramyocin are currently available treatments for both
   cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis.
20               Crytosporidiosis, caused by infections from protozoans of the genus Crytosporidia and
   results from direct human contact with fecal excrement of infected hosts. The infection of intestinal
   mucosal tissue can result in diarrhea. The disease typically manifests as an acute infection, but it can
   become chronic, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Treatments are typically palliative,
   especially hydration, but paromomycin, azithromycin and serum Ig (e.g., Lactobin-R*) have been
25 successful in clearing infection.
                 Trypanosomiasis, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma (E.g., T Brucei, subsp. gambiense,
   rodesiense infects humans and cattle through bites from the Tsetse-fly.             The challenge that this
   pathogen poses results from successive generations of populations with displaying different surface
   antigens.         Infections are characterized by elevated levels of non-specific and non-protective serum
30 immunoglobulins.
                Treatments for Trypanosomiasis include intravenous administration of the following:
   pentamidine              (for T.b. gambiense), intravenous   suramin (for T.b.   rhodesiense), eflornithine,
   melarsoprol both with and without nifurtimox.

                Helminthic infection, resulting from trematodes (E.g., Schistomsoma spp.), cestodes and
   nemotodes share the common immune responses of eosinophila and reaginic antibody, responses
   which are T-cell dependent.
                Schistosomiasis (aka            bilharzia), caused by Shistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, S.
 5 haematobium and S. mekongi start their life cyle as eggs in water, which then hatch into miracidia,
   which penetrate snails and create multiple generations of sporocysts. These in turn produce fork
   tailed cercariae which can infect the bloodstream of a human host as a shistosomula, which migrate
   initially to the lungs, and then to the liver. These flukes eventually pair, mate, and lay eggs in the
   mesenteric venules. While many of these eggs travels to the intestines and are excreted, some are
10 trapped in the submucosa, portal venules of the liver and other organs of the body.                        The
   granulomatous inflammation associated with the trapped eggs is the definitive symptom of chronic
   schistomsomiasis.
                Treatments            for schistosomiasis   include  adminisriaton of Praziquantel@,    antimony,
   Oxamniquine (S. mansoni) and Mirazid@.
15               Cestode infections can be classified into two groups, one is the intestinal dwelling adult
   tapeworms such as Diphyllobothrium latum and Taenia saginata, which have a restricted, non
   humoral immune effect. The second group describes a migratory tissue-encysting larval tapeworms
   such as Hymenolepis nana, Echinococcus granulosus and Taenia solium, which induce strong
   parenteral host responses and protective serum antibodies.                The most serious cestode infection in
20 human is Echinococcosis, which when implanted in the liver, lungs, brain, kidneys or other parts of
   the body can result in the formation of hydatid cysts.
                Treatments for Echinococcosis include adminstration of metronidazole, albendazole and
   surgical intervention, such as removal, aspiration, marsupialization or omentopexy.
                Nematodes are the most common varied and widely distributed helminths that infect humans,
25 caused disorders such as trichnosis, ascariasis, filariosis and strongylodiosis. Trichinosis, caused by
   Trichinella spiralis, can result from ingestion of the larvae of T. spiralis in raw meat or partially
   cooked meat such as pork. In humans, infections elicit strong humoral response with elevated IgM,
   followed by IgG production, followed by rapid expulsion of antibody-damaged worms by T
   lymphocytes.
30              The only known treatment for killing adult worms in the intestine is thiabendazole, while
   there is no known treatment to kill the larvae.
                Ascaris, also known as giant roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), is a common parasite in
   humans resulting from ingestion of fecally-contaminated substances.                 While patients can remain
   asymptomatic for very long periods of time, as larval stages travel through the body, they may cause
                                                                 117

   visceral damage, peritonitis and inflammation, enlargement of the liver or spleen, toxicity, and
   pneumonia.
                  Treatments for ascariasis        include administration    of mebendazole    (E.g.,  Vermox@),
   piperazine, pyrantel pamoate (E.g., Antiminth@, Pin-Rid, Pin-X@), albendazole, thiabendazole
 5  with or without piperazine, hexylresorcinol, santonin and oil of Chenopodium.                 The anti-PD-Li
    antibodies of the invention may be administered in combination with, prior or subsequent to
    administration of these therapies for the treatment of ascariasis.
                  Filariosis, caused by filarid nematodes, are introduced into humans by insect vectors.
    Onchocerca volvulus, which caused onchoceriasis or river blindness, is transmitted by bites from the
10 blackfly.           Infectious larvae lodge themselves subcutaneously and develop into adults, induce a
    fibrogenic host response, and shed large amount of microfilariae, which disperse subcutaneously and
   throughout the eyes, further inducing a keratisis or retininitis which then causes the cornea to become
    opaque. Lymphatic filariasis results from infection by Brugia spp. and Wuchereria spp. Over time,
    scarring of the lymph tissue, especially in the groin, may prevent draining, resulting in disfiguring
15  condition elephantiasis.
                  The primary treatment for filariosis is the administration of the antibiotic ivermectin,
    abendazole and diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC, Hetrazan@) with or without ivermectin or
    albendazole.              Other treatment prospects includes doxycycline, which kills a symbiotic bacteria,
    wolbochia.
20                Strongylodiosis, caused by parasites of the genus Strongyloides (E.g., S. stercoralis, S.
   fllleborni), is a disease that is passed to humans through fecally contaminated soil. They can exist in
   both a free living cycle (rabditiform larvae maturing into adult worms) as well as a parasitic cycle
    (filariform larvae maturing into adult worms) which penetrates the skin, travel to the lungs, then the
   pharynx and ultimately reside in the intestine. Autoininfection with Strongyloides is also known to
25  occur, which is essentially repeated infection by successive generations of filariform larvae.
                  Infections may be aymptomatic, or can be characterized by pain and diarrhea in the
    gastrointestinal tract, Lffler's syndrome in the lungs (i.e., eosinophila) and urticaria.               Blood
    eosinophila may also be present.             As persistent infection of Strongyloides can mimic peptic ulcer,
    gallbladder disease and Crohn's disease, misdiagnosis is common.                It is a particular problem in
30  immunocompromised hosts.
                  Known treatments for Strongyloidiosis is ivermectin, albenazole or thiabendazole but as this
    mediation only kills adult worms, repeated administration is necessary.

                                         e.     vaccination
                 Vaccination or the administration of antigenic material to induce immunity to disease is
   routinely used to prevent or ameliorate the effects of infection by a pathogen.            Enhancing host
   immunity can be used on undesired antigens found not only on infectious pathogens, but also host
 5 tissue that has become diseased (e.g., cancerous). Traditionally, vaccines are derived from weakened
   or dead whole pathogens, but they can also be peptides representing epitopes on the intact pathogen
   that are specifically recognized by by human class I or class II major histocompatability complex
   (MHC) molecules. Peptide antigens of particular interest are those which are specifically recognized
   by T cells.
10              Recently, it has been shown that combining a therapeutic vaccination with adminstriation of
   PD-Li blockade on exhausted CD8+ T cells resulted in enhanced function and viral control in a
   chronic infection mouse model. Ha et al., J.Exp.Med. 205(3): 543-555 (2008). As a result, the anti
   PD-Li         antibodies           described herein may also be combined with antigen vaccination (e.g.,
   administered prior, simultaneous or after) to treat infection (e.g., acute and chronic) resulting from
15 viral, bacterial, fungal or protozoan invasion as well as tumor immunity.
                 G.           Pharmaceutical Dosages:
                 Dosages and desired drug concentration of pharmaceutical compositions of the present
   invention may vary depending on the particular use envisioned. The determination of the appropriate
20 dosage or route of administration is well within the skill of an ordinary artisan. Animal experiments
   provide reliable guidance for the determination of effective doses for human therapy. Interspecies
   scaling of effective doses can be performed following the principles laid down by Mordenti, J. and
   Chappell, W. "The Use of Interspecies Scaling in Toxicokinetics," In Toxicokinetics and New Drug
   Development, Yacobi et al., Eds, Pergamon Press, New York 1989, pp. 4 2 -4 6 .
25               When in vivo administration of the polypeptides or antibodies described herein are used,
   normal dosage amounts may vary from about 10 ng/kg up to about 100 mg/kg of mammal body
   weight or more per day, preferably about 1 mg/kg/day to 10 mg/kg/day, depending upon the route of
   administration.               Guidance as to particular dosages and methods of delivery is provided in the
   literature; see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,657,760; 5,206,344; or 5,225,212. It is within the scope
30 of the invention that different formulations will be effective for different treatments and different
   disorders, and that administration intended to treat a specific organ or tissue may necessitate delivery
   in a manner different from that to another organ or tissue. Moreover, dosages may be administered
   by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. For repeated administrations
   over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired
                                                              119

   suppression of disease symptoms occurs.                 However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The
   progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.
                 H.           Administration of the Formulation
 5               The formulations of the present invention, including but not limited to reconstituted and
   liquid formulations, are administered to a mammal in need of treatment with the anti-PD-Li
   antibodies, preferably a human, in accord with known methods, such as intravenous administration as
   a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by intramuscular, intraperitoneal,
   intracerobrospinal, subcutaneous, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrathecal, oral, topical, or inhalation
10 routes.
                 In preferred embodiments, the formulations are administered to the mammal by subcutaneous
   (i.e. beneath the skin) administration. For such purposes, the formulation may be injected using a
   syringe. However, other devices for administration of the formulation are available such as injection
   devices (e.g. the INJECT-EASETM and GENJECT TM devices); injector pens (such as the GENPEN TM);
15 auto-injector             devices, needleless   devices  (e.g. MEDIJECTORTM and BIOJECTOR TM ); and
   subcutaneous patch delivery systems.
                 In a specific embodiment, the present invention is directed to kits for a single dose
   administration unit. Such kits comprise a container of an aqueous formulation of therapeutic protein
   or antibody, including both single or multi-chambered pre-filled syringes.             Exemplary pre-filled
20 syringes are available from Vetter GmbH, Ravensburg, Germany.
                 The appropriate dosage ("therapeutically effective amount") of the protein will depend, for
   example, on the condition to be treated, the severity and course of the condition, whether the protein
   is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history
   and response to anti-PD-Li antibody, the format of the formulation used, and the discretion of the
25 attending physician. The anti-PD-Li antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or
   over a series of treatments and may be administered to the patient at any time from diagnosis
   onwards. The anti-PD-LI antibody may be administered as the sole treatment or in conjunction with
   other drugs or therapies useful in treating the condition in question.
                 For anti-PD-LI antibodies, an initial candidate dosage can range from about 0.1-20 mg/kg for
30 administration to the patient, which can take the form of one or more separate administrations.
   However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of such therapy is easily monitored by
   conventional techniques.

                I.            Articles of Manufacture
                In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture is provided which contains
   the formulation and preferably provides instructions for its use.                 The article of manufacture
   comprises a container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials (e.g. dual chamber
 5 vials), syringes (such as single or dual chamber syringes) and test tubes.             The container may be
   formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds the formulation. The
   label, which is on, or associated with the container may indicate directions for reconstitution and/or
   use.        The label may further indicate that the formulation is useful or intended for subcutaneous
   administration, and/or for the treatment of a T-cell dysfunctional disorder. The container holding the
10 formulation may be a multi-use vial, which allows for repeat administrations (e.g. from 2-6
   administrations) of the reconstituted formulation. The article of manufacture may further comprise a
   second container comprising a suitable diluent (e.g. BWFI).                Upon mixing of the diluent and the
   lyophilized formulation, the final protein concentration in the reconstituted formulation will generally
   be at least 50 mg/ml. The article of manufacture may further include other materials desirable from
15 a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and
   package inserts with instructions for use.
                The invention will be more fully understood by reference to the following examples. They
   should not, however, be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. All citations throughout the
   disclosure are hereby expressly incorporated by reference.
20              In another embodiment, the invention provides for an article of manufacture comprising the
   formulations described herein for administration in an auto-injector device. An auto-injector can be
   described as an injection device that upon activation, will deliver its contents without additional
   necessary action from the patient or administrator. They are particularly suited for self-medication of
   therapeutic formulations when the delivery rate must be constant and the time of delivery is greater
25 than a few moments.

                                    Identification of Anti-PD-Li Antibodies in Phage Libraries
30 Library Sorting and Screening to Identify Anti-PD-LlAntibodies
                Human (R&D Systems, cat# 156-B7) and murine (R&D Systems, cat# 1019-B7) PD-L1-Fc
   fusions were used as antigens for alternate library sorting. Specifically, phage libraries were sorted
   first against human antigen, followed by murine, human, and murine antigen in the subsequent three
   rounds. Nunc 96 well Maxisorp* immunoplates were coated overnight at 4'C with target antigen (10
35 pg/ml) and were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with phage blocking buffer PBST
                                                                121

   (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.05% (v/v) tween
   20). Antibody phage libraries VH (see, e.g., Lee et al., J. Immunol. Meth. 284:119-132, 2004) and
   VH/VL (see Liang et al., J. Mol. Biol. 366: 815-829, 2007) were added to antigen plates separately
   and incubated overnight at room temperature. The following day antigen-coated plates were washed
 5 ten times with PBT (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20), and bound phage were eluted with 50 mM HCl and
   500 mM NaCl for 30 minutes and neutralized with an equal volume of 1 M Tris base (pH 7.5).
   Recovered phages were amplified in E. coli XL-1 Blue cells.                        During the subsequent selection
   rounds, incubation of antibody phage with the antigen-coated plates was reduced to 2-3 hours, and
   the stringency of plate washing was gradually increased.
10              After 4 rounds of panning, significant enrichment was observed. 96 clones were picked each
   from VH and VH/VL library sorting to determine whether they specifically bound to both human and
   murine PD-L1-Fc.                   The variable regions of these clones were PCR sequenced to identify unique
   sequence clones.
                The parental clones of interest were reformatted into IgGs by cloning VL and            VH regions of
15 individual clones into the LPG3 and LPG4 vector (Lee et al., supra), respectively, transiently
   expressing in mammalian CHO cells, and purifying with a protein A colunm.                           The 13 Phage
   antibodies were evaluated for their ability to block the interaction between soluble PD-1-Fc fusion
   protein and human or mouse PD-Li expressed in 293 cells (IC 50 values are designated in Table 1
   upper half). YW243.55, the antibody with the lowest                IC 5 0 for blocking human PD-Li binding to PD
20  1 was selected for subsequent affinity maturation to improve its affinity for both human and mouse
   PD-Li.         (Table 1). An antibody with comparable cross reactivity against both primate and murine
   species (as well as retaining affinity to human) would provide for a therapeutic of enhanced value, in
   that the same antibody that has been well characterized in experimental models can be used in human
   clinical trials. This avoids the uncertainly resulting from the use of a model-specific surrogate.
25
   Construct Librariesfor Affinity Improvement of Clones Derivedfrom the                   VH Library
                 Phagemid pW0703 (derived from phagemid pV0350-2b (Lee et al., J. Mol. Biol 340: 1073
    1093 (2004)), containing stop codon (TAA) in all CDR-L3 positions and displaying monovalent Fab
   on the surface of M13 bacteriophage) served as the library template for grafting heavy chain variable
30 domains        (VH)      of clones of interest from the   VH  library for affinity maturation. Both hard and soft
   randomization strategies were used for affinity maturation. For hard randomization, one light chain
   library with selected positions of the three light chain CDRs was randomized using amino acids
   designed to mimic natural human antibodies and the designed DNA degeneracy was as described in
   Lee et al. (J. Mol. Biol 340, 1073-1093 (2004)). For soft randomization, residues at positions 91-94,
35 and 96 of CDR-L3, 28-31 and 34-35 of CDR-H1, 50, 52, and 53-58 of CDR-H2, 95-99 and 100A of
                                                                 122

   CDR-H3, were targeted; and two different combinations of CDR loops, L3/H1/H2 and L3/H3, were
   selected for randomization.            To achieve the soft randomization conditions, which introduced the
   mutation rate of approximately 50% at the selected positions, the mutagenic DNA was synthesized
   with 70-10-10-10 mixtures of bases favoring the wild type nucleotides (Gallop et al., Journal of
 5 Medicinal Chemistry 37:1233-1251 (1994)).
   Phage Sorting to GenerateAffinity Improvement
                The phage clones previously identified were subjected to plate sorting for the first round,
   followed by five or six rounds of solution sorting.            The libraries were sorted against human and
10 murine PD-L1-Fc separately (R&D Systems, cat. # 156-B7, cat # 1019-B7, respectively).                  For the
   human PD-Li-Fc target, at the first round of plate sorting, three libraries were sorted against target
   coated plate (NUNC Maxisorp* plate) separately with phage input about 3 O.D./ml in 1% BSA and
   0.05% Tween 20 for 2 hours at room temperature.               After the first round of plate sorting, solution
   sorting was performed to increase the stringency of selection. For solution sorting, 1 O.D./ml phage
15 propagated from the first round of plate sorting were incubated with 20 nM biotinylated target
   protein (the concentration is based on parental clone phage IC5 0 value) in 100 gL buffer containing
    1% Superblock (Pierce Biotechnology) and 0.05% Tween-20 for 30 minutes at room temperature.
   The mixture was further diluted iOX with 1% Superblock, and 100 gL/well was applied to
   neutravidin-coated wells (5 gg/ml) for 15 minutes at room temperature with gentle shaking such that
20 biotinylated target bound phage.            The wells were washed     loX   with PBS-0.05% Tween-20.        To
   determine background binding, control wells containing phage with targets that were not biotinylated
   were captured on neutravidin-coated plates. Bound phage was eluted with 0. IN HCl for 20 minutes,
   neutralized by 1/10 volume of IM Tris pH-i1, titered, and propagated for the next round. Next, five
   more rounds of solution sorting were carried out together with two methods of increasing selection
25 stringency.            The first of which is for on-rate selection by decreasing biotinylated target protein
   concentration from 4 nM to 0.5 nM, and the second of which is for off-rate selection by adding
   excess amounts of non-biotinylated target protein (100-2000 fold more) to compete off weaker
   binders either at room temperature or 37'C. Also, the phage input was decreased (0. 1-0.5 O.D/ml) to
   lower background phage binding. For murine PD-L1-Fc target, phage sorting method is similar to the
30 one described above for the human PD-Li Fc antigen, with a few modifications. Specifically, 100
   nM biotinylated murine PD-L1-Fc was used for solution panning immediately after first round of
   plate panning. In the four subsequent rounds of solution panning, biotinylated target was reduced
   from 10 nM to 1 nM, and 200-500 fold excess of non-biotinylated target was added at room
   temperature.
35               The affinity matured clones were then further screened with the High Throughput Affinity
                                                            123

   Screening ELISA procedure described in the following example.
   High Throughput Affinity ScreeningELISA (Single Spot Competition)
                 Colonies were picked from the seventh and sixth round screens for the human and murine
 5 PD-Li target, respectively.                  Colonies were grown overnight at 37'C in 150 gL/well of 2YT media
   with 50 gg/ml carbenicillin and 1E1O/ml K07 in 96-well plate (Falcon).                              From the same plate, a
   colony of XL- 1 infected parental phage was picked as control. 96-well Nunc Maxisorp* plates were
   coated with 100L/well of human and murine PD-L1-Fc protein (2 gg/ml) separately in PBS at 4'C
   overnight or room temperature for 2 hours. The plates were blocked with 65 gL of 1% BSA for 30
10 min and 40 [L of I% Tween 20 for another 30 minutes.
                 The phage supernatant was diluted 1:10 in ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay)
   buffer (PBS with 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20) with or without 10 nM target protein in 100 gL total
   volume and incubated at least 1 hour at room temperature in an F plate (NUNC).                            75 gL of mixture
   with or without target protein was transferred side by side to the target protein coated plates. The
15 plate was gently shaken for 15 min to allow the capture of unbound phage to the target protein-coated
   plate.       The plate was washed at least five times with PBS-0.05% Tween-20. The binding was
   quantified by adding horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-M13 antibody in ELISA buffer
   (1:5000) and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature.                            The plates were washed with PBS
   0.05% Tween 20 at least five times. Next, 100 gL/well of a 1:1 ratio of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine
20 (TMB) Peroxidase substrate and Peroxidase Solution B (H 2 0 2 ) (Kirkegaard-Perry Laboratories
   (Gaithersburg, MD)) was added to the well and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. The
   reaction was stopped by adding 100 gL IM Phosphoric Acid (H 3 PO 4 ) to each well and allowed to
   incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature.                      The OD (optical density) of the yellow color in each
   well was determined using a standard ELISA plate reader at 450 nm. The OD reduction (%) was
25 calculated by the following equation.
   OD 45onm reduction (%)             = [(OD 4 onm of wells with competitor) / (OD 4 onm of well with no competitor)] x 100
                 In comparison to the OD 45 o.m reduction (%) of the well of parental phage (100%), clones that
30 had the OD 45 onm reduction (%) lower than 50% for both the human and murine target were picked for
   sequence analysis. Unique clones were selected for phage preparation to determine binding affinity
   (phage IC 5 o) against both human and murine PD-L-Fc by comparison with parental clones.

   Results and Discussion:
                 Fifteen unique phage antibodies derived from YW243.55 that bound both human and murine
   PD-Li were chosen and reformatted to full length IgGi antibodies for further evaluation. The light
   and heavy chain variable region sequences of these antibodies are reported in Figures 1 A and B.
 5              The fifteen reformatted Abs were tested for their ability to block the binding of PD-1 to 293
   cells expressing either human or mouse PD-Li via an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) cell-binding
   assay. (Table I - lower half: In Table I "Format I" describes soluble human PD-1-Fc binding to
   human PD-Li-tranfected 293 cells; "Format 2" describes murine PD-1-Fc binding to murine PD-Li
   transfeced 293 cells, and "Format 3" describes human PD-I binding to murine PD-LI-transfected 293
10 cells. While all fifteen affinity improved Abs had acquired significant cross-reactivity to mouse PD
   Li, YW243.55S70 was selected as the primary candidate to pursue based on its ability to block
   binding of both human and mouse PD-Li to PD-1 (Table                1: IC 50 values of 49 pM and 22 pM,
   respectively).

   the iodinated antibody in each competition reaction with cells was -150 pM (-120,000 cpms per
   0.25 mL) and the final concentration of the unlabeled antibody in the competition reaction with cells
   varied, starting at 500 nM and then decreasing by 2 fold for 10 concentrations.                 Competition
   reactions with cells were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Competition reaction with cells
 5 for each concentration of unlabeled antibody was assayed in triplicate. After the 2 hour incubation,
   the competition reactions were transferred to a Millipore Multiscreen filter plate and washed 4X with
   binding buffer to separate the free from bound iodinated antibody. The filters were counted on a
   Wallac Wizard 1470 gamma counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences Inc. Wellesley,
   MA). The binding data was evaluated using NewLigand software (Genentech), which uses the fitting
10 algorithm of Munson and Robard to determine the binding affinity of the antibody. Musson et al.,
   Anal. Biochem. 107: 220-39 (1980).

                   For hPD-1-Fc-biotin binding to hPD-L1-Fc (Format 5), the format is similar to the above
     assay except hPD-1-Fc-biotin was used instead of hB7.1-Fc-biotin for binding. The TMB substrate
     reaction time was 17 minutes.
 5                 For mB7.1-Fc-biotin binding to mPD-LI-Fc (Format 6), the format is similar to Format 5,
      except that mPD-LI-Fc was used to coat plate instead of hPD-L1-Fc and mB7.1-Fc-biotin was used
      for binding instead of hB7. 1-Fc-biotin. The TMB substrate reaction time was 7 minutes.
                   For mPD-1-Fc-biotin binding to mPD-LI-Fc (Format 7), the format is similar to the mouse
     ELISA mentioned above except mPD-1-Fc-biotin was used for binding instead of mB7.1-Fc
10   biotin. The TMB substrate reaction time was 5 minutes.
     Results:
                   Assessment of the IC 50 of the affinity-matured phage anti-PD-Li Antibody YW243.55.S70 to
     block interactions between the designated binding pairs is reported in Table 4. YW243.55S70 was
15    able to block binding of human PD-Li to hB7.1 Fc with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of
      38 pM, a concentration relatively comparable to its IC 50 value for blocking the PD-Li/PD-1
      interaction (42 pM).                   Biacore studies measuring the capacity of YW243.55S70 to block both
      interactions of PD-Li with PD-1 and B7.1 were consistent with these ELISA results (data not

   B16 melanoma cells are treated with IFN-y to upregulate their PD-LI expression. Then, the cells are
   co-cultured in the presence of anti-PD-Li antibody, and the effect on IFN-y production is evaluated.
   B16 cells were chosen for the tertiary stimulation because they endogenously express low levels of
   gp100 peptide (as opposed to exogenous application of the peptide). Moreover, as these cells also do
 5 not express PD-L2, B7.1 or B7.2, the effect of additional signaling unrelated to PD-Li (e.g. signaling
   through CD28 or CTLA-4 or PD-L2 induced signaling through PD-1) is minimized.
                PMEL assay:
                As shown in Figure 3, anti-PD-Li antibodies enhance both the percentage of IFN-y
10 producing PMEL CD8* T cells and the average levels of IFN-y produced in response to the
   designated amounts of gp 100 peptide.
                 D.0 11.10 in vitro assay:
                A similar assay utilizing Ova-specific TCR Tg CD4+ T cells shows enhanced T cell
15 proliferation in the presence of the anti-PD-Li Ab following prior stimulation with Ova peptide to
   induce expression of PD-1 (Fig 4). In the final stimulation, irradiated A20 B cells that express PD
   LI were used to present the designated concentrations of Ova peptide to the DO. ii. 10 T cells.
   Notably, the contribution of the PD-i/PD-Li axis is more pronounced at lower degrees of antigen
   receptor stimulation, levels that more closely reflect the physiologically relevant magnitude of
20 stimulation.

   Secondary stimulation (day 4-7)
 5               PMEL cultures were spun down and the media was aspirated using a multi-channel pipet.
   Fresh media was added and mixed to wash the cells, followed by another spin. Majority of the media
   was removed and antibodies (Herceptin, YW243.55.S70, or none) were added for a final
   concentration of 10pig/ml.            Conditions were set up in duplicate wells such that the average IFN-y
   production could be assessed at the endpoint.
10              DC-1 cells were pulsed with 0.1 pag/ml gp100 peptide for 2 hours at 37 0 C and washed.
   GpI00-pulsed DC-I cells were added to washed PMEL cultures at 40,000 cells/well. PMEL and DC
    1 + antibody were co-cultured for 3 days.
   Third stimulation (day 7-8)
15               One day prior to third stimulation on day 6, B16 melanoma cells were incubated with
   20ng/ml of mouse IFN-y (R&D Systems) overnight to upregulate their PD-LI expression.
                 On day 7, PMEL cultures were spun down and the media was aspirated using a multi-channel
   pipet.       Fresh media was added and mixed, followed by another spin. Majority of the media was
   removed and antibodies were added for a final concentration of 10 pg/ml.
20              After overnight stimulation with IFN-y, B16 cells were washed and split into three groups for
   a two hour incubation with either no gpi00, gpiOO at I ng/ml (gp100 low), and gp100 at 10ng/ml
   (gp100 high). Cells were washed and then added to the washed PMEL + Ab cultures at 40,000 cells
   per well and incubated together overnight.

                 Golgi-Plug (BD Biosciences) was added for the last 5 hours of culture as per manufacturer's
   instructions.             IFN-y intracellular staining was done using BD Biosciences Cytofix/Cytoperm
   Fixation/Permeabilization Solution kit as per manufacturer's instructions and all staining antibodies
   were also from BD Biosciences.               Cells were surface stained with CD8a PE and Thyl.1 FITC and
30 intracellular stained with IFN-y APC at saturating concentrations.

10                                    Effects of PD-Li blockade on LCMV in vivo model
                T cells under conditions of chronic stimulation have been shown to upregulate and sustain
   expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1. Ligation of PD-1 by either of its two ligands PD-Li and
   PD-L2 contributes to the refractory state of the chronically activated T cell, attenuating its response
   to its cognate antigen.               In mice persistently-infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
15 (LCMV), blockade of PD-1 or its ligand PD-Li is sufficient to revitalize chronically refractory T
   cells, enhancing the magnitude and functional quality of the anti-viral T cell response. Similarly,
   humans chronically infected with HIV or HCV exhibit T cells refractory to simulation whose activity
   can be enhanced in vitro by blockade of PD-1 or PD-Li. Therefore, activity of PD-Li blockade in
   the LCMV model suggests therapeutic potential for enhancing anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity.
20              For the LCMV in vivo experiments in the mouse, we have reformatted the humanized anti
   PD-Li antibody (YW243.55S70), by cloning the phage-derived heavy and light chain variable region
   sequences upstream of mouse IgG2a heavy chain and mouse kappa light chain constant domains. To
   prevent antibody-mediated cytotoxicity of PD-Li expressing cells, by inhibiting Fcy receptor binding,
   positions 265 (aspartic acid) and 297 (asparagine) were changed to alanine (DANA). Shields, RL et
25 al J. Biol Chem 2001 276 (9): 6591-6604. To test the ability of the anti-PD-Li antibody to enhance
   anti-viral immunity in a chronic infection, mice were infected at Day 0 with 2 x 106 plaque forming
   units (pfu) of Clone 13 LCMV or the Armstrong strain of LCMV as a reference control.                    The
   schematic of the experimental design appears in Figure 6.               Infection with Clone 13 results in a
   chronic infection, characterized by T cells that expand but are unable to effectively clear the virus,
30 while Armstrong LCMV is cleared within 8-10 days of infection. On day 14, mice began treatment
   with either anti-PD-Li or control mIgG delivered at 10mg/kg doses 3x/week. At Days 21 and 28,
   analysis of CD8 T cell function and viral titers in blood and tissues were performed.
                Consistent with published data of Barber et. al, Nature 439:682-7 (2006), this example shows
   the ability of the anti-PD-Li Ab to enhance the cytotoxic lymphocyte response to LCMV following a
35 2 week treatment regimen in a chronic LCMV infection. Figure 7A shows the % of CD8 T cells that
                                                               135

   express CD107a on their cell surface in response to gp33 LCMV-specific peptide. Plasma membrane
   expression of CD107a, normally expressed intracellularly, accompanies the degranulation process
   and therefore serves as a surrogate marker for degranulation. Relative to the response of cells from
   the acute Armstrong LCMV infection, cells from animals infected with the chronic strain, clone 13,
 5 are impaired in degraulation (control Ig group), while PD-Li blockade was able to restore CD8+
   degraulation to levels comparable to those observed in the Armstrong infection.                  Similarly, 7B
   demonstrates the increased % of IFN-y-producing CD8 T cells in response to LCMV gp33 in the anti
   PD-L 1-treated group relative to control Ig.
                Next, the impact of the anti-PD-Li Ab on reducing or eradicating LCMV virus in blood and
10 tissues was tested. In Figure 8A, the graphs show log virus titers in the indicated tissue of control Ig
   and PD-Li treated animals at day 21 and 28 after infection with Clone 13 LCMV.                        Antibody
   treatment was initiated at Day 14 post-infection. Blockade of PD-Li resulted in highly significant
   reduction in viral titers in blood, liver, brain, lung, and kidney. Impressively, in 3 of 5 mice, a-PD
   LI Ab reduced blood LCMV titers to levels below detection (<1 x              10-5). In a subsequent experiment
15 of comparable design, virus eradication in blood and liver was observed in 5/5 mice treated for 2
   weeks with anti-PD-LI at doses of either 10mg/kg or 2 mg/kg 3x/week (data not shown). The lower
   graph shows the kinetics of reduction of viral titers in the blood and demonstrates an average
   reduction of 96.8% in the anti-PD-Li treated group at Day 28 relative to control. These data support
   the importance of the PD-i/PD-Li pathway in inhibiting T cell responses in chronic infections and
20 are consistent with effects of in vitro PD-LI blockade on T cells obtained from humans with chronic
   infections such as Hepatitis C and HIV.

25               It is now apparent that many tumors exploit expression of PD-i ligands as a means to
   attenuate anti-tumor T cells responses. Several human cancers have been characterized to express
   elevated levels of PD-Li on both tumors and tumor-infiltrating leukocytes and this elevated PD-Li
   expression is often associated with a worse prognosis.          Mouse tumor models demonstrate similar
   increases in PD-LI expression within tumors and demonstrate a role for the PD-I/PD-LI pathway in
30 inhibiting tumor immunity.
                Here we present an experiment demonstrating the impact of blocking PD-Li on orthotopic
   tumor growth of MC38.Ova murine colorectal carcinoma cells in syngeneic C57B6 mice (Figure 9A).
   These cells express ovalbumin via retroviral transduction and express PD-LI, but not PD-L2 on their
   cell surface as assessed by Flow Cytometry (histogram - Figure 10A).            Mice were inoculated
35 subcutaneously with 0.5 million MC38.Ova cells on Day 0. On Day 1 or on Day 14 mice (when

   growth.         These results demonstrate the unique role of the PD-i/PD-Li axis over CTLA4/B7 in
   suppression of the anti-tumor immune response and support the potential for the treatment of human
   cancers with antibodies that block the PD-LI interaction with PD-I and B7.1.

                 Tumors are measured and mice weighed 2X/week. Animals exhibiting weight loss of >15%
   will be weighed daily and euthanized if they lose >20% body weight. Mice will be euthanized when
   tumor volumes exceed 3,000 mm3 , or after 3 months if tumors do not form.
                 This study shows (Figure 10) that PD-LI blockade was more effective than a-VEGF and an
25 inductive regimen of gemcitabine alone.
                                                             EXAMPLE 10
                                      Expression of anti-PD-LI antibody in mammalian cells
                 This example illustrates preparation of potentially glycosylated forms of anti-PD-LI antibody
30 by recombinant expression in mammalian cells.
                 The vector, pRK5 (see EP 307,247, published March 15, 1989), is employed as the
   expression vector. Optionally, DNA encoding the light and/or heavy chain of the antibody is ligated
   into pRK5 with selected restriction enzymes to allow insertion such DNA using ligation methods
   such as described in Sambrook et al., supra.
                                                               139

                In one embodiment, the selected host cells may be 293 cells. Human 293 cells (ATCC CCL
    1573) are grown to confluence in tissue culture plates in medium such as DMEM supplemented with
   fetal calf serum and optionally, nutrient components and/or antibiotics.                    About 10 gg if DNA
   encoding the pRK5-antibody is mixed with about 1 gg DNA encoding the VA RNA gene
 5 [Thimmappaya et al., Cell, 3:543 (1982)] and dissolved in 500 gL of 1 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM
   EDTA, 0.227 M CaCl 2. To this mixture is added, dropwise, 500 gL of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.35),
   280 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM NaPO 4, and a precipitate is allowed to form for 10 minutes at 25'C. The
   precipitate is suspended and added to the 293 cells and allowed to settle for about four hours at 37 0 C.
   The culture medium is aspirated off and 2 ml of 20% glycerol in PBS is added for 30 seconds. The
10 293 cells are then washed with serum free medium, fresh medium is added and the cells are incubated
   for about 5 days.
                Approximately 24 hours after the transfections, the culture medium is removed and replaced
                                                                                          5
   with culture medium (alone) or culture medium containing 200 gCi/ml                  1  S-cysteine and 200 gCi/ml
     5
   1  S-methionine. After a 12 hour incubation, the conditioned medium is collected, concentrated on a
15 spin filter, and loaded onto a 15% SDS gel. The processed gel may be dried and exposed to film for
   a selected period of time to reveal the presence of the antibody. The cultures containing transfected
   cells may undergo further incubation (in serum free medium) and the medium is tested in selected
   bioassays.
                 In an alternative technique, the antibody may be introduced into 293 cells transiently using
20 the dextran sulfate method described by Somparyrac et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 12:7575 (1981).
   293 cells are grown to maximal density in a spinner flask and 700 gg DNA encoding the pRK5
   antibody is added.                 The cells are first concentrated from the spinner flask by centrifugation and
   washed with PBS. The DNA-dextran precipitate is incubated on the cell pellet for four hours. The
   cells are treated with 20% glycerol for 90 seconds, washed with tissue culture medium, and re
25 introduced into the spinner flask containing tissue culture medium, 5 gg/ml bovine insulin and 0.1
   gg/ml bovine transferrin. After about four days, the conditioned media is centrifuged and filtered to
   remove cells and debris. The sample containing the expressed antibody can then be concentrated and
   purified by any selected method, such as dialysis and/or column chromatography.
                 In another embodiment, the antibody can be expressed in CHO cells. The DNA encoding the
30 antibody ligated into pRK5 can be transfected into CHO cells using known reagents such as CaPO 4
   or DEAE-dextran. As described above, the cell cultures can be incubated, and the medium replaced
                                                                                                5
   with culture medium (alone) or medium containing a radiolabel such as                      1  S-methionine. After
   determining the presence of the antibody, the culture medium may be replaced with serum free
   medium. Preferably, the cultures are incubated for about 6 days, and then the conditioned medium is
                                                                 140

   harvested. The medium containing the expressed antibody can then be concentrated and purified by
   any selected method.
                Epitope-tagged variants of the antibody may also be expressed in host CHO cells. The DNA
   encoding the antibody ligated into pRK5 may be subcloned out of the pRK5 vector. The subclone
 5 insert can undergo PCR to fuse in frame with a selected epitope tag such as a poly-his tag into a
   Baculovirus expression vector. The poly-his tagged DNA encoding the antibody insert can then be
   subcloned into a SV40 driven vector containing a selection marker such as DHFR for selection of
   stable clones. Finally, the CHO cells can be transfected (as described above) with the SV40 driven
   vector. Labeling may be performed, as described above, to verify expression. The culture medium
10 containing the expressed poly-His tagged antibody can then be concentrated and purified by any
   selected method, such as by Ni"-chelate affinity chromatography.
                 The antibody may also be expressed in CHO and/or COS cells by a transient expression
   procedure or in CHO cells by another stable expression procedure.
                 Stable expression in CHO cells is performed using the following procedure. The proteins are
15 expressed as an IgG construct (immunoadhesin), in which the coding sequences for the soluble forms
   (e.g. extracellular domains) of the respective proteins are fused to an IgG1 constant region sequence
   containing the hinge, CH2 and CH2 domains and/or is a poly-His tagged form.
                Following PCR amplification, the respective DNAs are subcloned in a CHO expression
   vector using standard techniques as described in Ausubel et al., Current Protocols of Molecular
20 Biology, Unit 3.16, John Wiley and Sons (1997).           CHO expression vectors are constructed to have
   compatible restriction sites 5= and 3= of the DNA of interest to allow the convenient shuttling of
   cDNA=s. The vector used expression in CHO cells is as described in Lucas et al., Nucl. Acids Res.
   24:9 (1774-1779 (1996), and uses the SV40 early promoter/enhancer to drive expression of the
   cDNA of interest and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).             DHFR expression permits selection for
25 stable maintenance of the plasmid following transfection.
                Twelve micrograms of the desired plasmid DNA is introduced into approximately 10 million
   CHO cells using commercially available transfection reagents SUPERFECT(Quiagen), DOSPER
   or FUGENE (Boehringer Mannheim).               The cells are grown as described in Lucas et al., supra.
   Approximately 3 x 10- cells are frozen in an ampule for further growth and production as described
30 below.
                 The ampules containing the plasmid DNA are thawed by placement into water bath and
   mixed by vortexing. The contents are pipetted into a centrifuge tube containing 10 mLs of media and
   centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant is aspirated and the cells are resuspended in
   10 mL of selective media (0.2 Om filtered PS20 with 5% 0.2 qom diafiltered fetal bovine serum).
35 The cells are then aliquoted into a 100 mL spinner containing 90 mL of selective media. After 1-2
                                                          141

   days, the cells are transferred into a 250 mL spinner filled with 150 mL selective growth medium and
   incubated at 37'C. After another 2-3 days, 250 mL, 500 mL and 2000 mL spinners are seeded with 3
   x 105    cells/mL. The cell media is exchanged with fresh media by centrifugation and resuspension in
   production medium. Although any suitable CHO media may be employed, a production medium
 5 described in U.S. Patent No. 5,122,469, issued June 16, 1992 may actually be used. A 3L production
   spinner is seeded at 1.2 x 106 cells/mL. On day 0, the cell number and pH is determined. On day 1,
   the spinner is sampled and sparging with filtered air is commenced.                  On day 2, the spinner is
   sampled, the temperature shifted to 33'C, and 30 mL of 500 g/L glucose and 0.6 mL of 10% antifoam
   (e.g., 35% polydimethylsiloxane emulsion, Dow Corning 365 Medical Grade Emulsion) taken.
10 Throughout the production, the pH is adjusted as necessary to keep it at around 7.2. After 10 days, or
   until the viability dropped below 70%, the cell culture is harvested by centrifugation and filtering
   through a 0.22 Om filter. The filtrate was either stored at 4'C or immediately loaded onto columns
   for purification.
                For the poly-His tagged constructs, the proteins are purified using a Ni-NTA column
15 (Qiagen). Before purification, imidazole is added to the conditioned media to a concentration of 5
   mM. The conditioned media is pumped onto a 6 ml Ni-NTA column equilibrated at 4'C, in 20 mM
   Hepes, pH 7.4, buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole at a flow rate of 4-5 ml/min.
   After loading, the column is washed with additional equilibration buffer and the protein eluted with
   equilibration buffer containing 0.25 M imidazole.                 The highly purified protein is subsequently
20 desalted into a storage buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, 0.14 M NaCl and 4% mannitol, pH 6.8, with
   a 25 ml G25 Superfine (Pharmacia) column and stored at -80'C.
                Inmunoadhesin (Fc-containing) constructs are purified from the conditioned media as
   follows. The conditioned medium is pumped onto a 5 ml Protein A column (Pharmacia) which had
   been equilibrated in 20 mM Na phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. After loading, the column is washed
25 extensively with equilibration buffer before elution with 100 mM citric acid, pH 3.5. The eluted
   protein is immediately neutralized by collecting 1 ml fractions into tubes containing 275 OL of 1 M
   Tris buffer, pH 9.                 The highly purified protein is subsequently desalted into storage buffer as
   described above for the poly-His tagged proteins. The homogeneity is assessed by SDS
   polyacrylamide gels and by N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation.

                This example illustrates preparation of an unglycosylated form of anti-PD-Li antibody by
   recombinant expression in E. coli.
35              The DNA sequence encoding the anti-PD-Li antibody is initially amplified using selected
                                                                142

   PCR primers.                  The primers should contain restriction enzyme sites which correspond to the
   restriction enzyme sites on the selected expression vector. A variety of expression vectors may be
   employed. An example of a suitable vector is pBR322 (derived from E. coli; see Bolivar et al., Gene,
   2:95 (1977)) which contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance. The vector is digested
 5 with restriction enzyme and dephosphorylated. The PCR amplified sequences are then ligated into
   the vector. The vector will preferably include sequences which encode for an antibiotic resistance
   gene, a trp promoter, a polyhis leader (including the first six STII codons, polyhis sequence, and
   enterokinase cleavage site), the NPOR coding region, lambda transcriptional terminator, and an argU
   gene.
10              The ligation mixture is then used to transform a selected E. coli strain using the methods
   described in Sambrook et al., supra. Transformants are identified by their ability to grow on LB
   plates and antibiotic resistant colonies are then selected.              Plasmid DNA can be isolated and
   confirmed by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing.
                Selected clones can be grown overnight in liquid culture medium such as LB broth
15 supplemented with antibiotics. The overnight culture may subsequently be used to inoculate a larger
   scale culture.             The cells are then grown to a desired optical density, during which the expression
   promoter is turned on.
                After culturing the cells for several more hours, the cells can be harvested by centrifugation.
   The cell pellet obtained by the centrifugation can be solubilized using various agents known in the
20 art, and the solubilized antibody can then be purified using a metal chelating column under
   conditions that allow tight binding of the antibody.
                Anti-PD-Li antibody may also be expressed in E. coli in a poly-His tagged form, using the
   following procedure. The DNA encoding antibody is initially amplified using selected PCR primers.
   The primers contain restriction enzyme sites which correspond to the restriction enzyme sites on the
25 selected expression vector, and other useful sequences providing for efficient and reliable translation
   initiation, rapid purification on a metal chelation column, and proteolytic removal with enterokinase.
   The PCR-amplified, poly-His tagged sequences are then ligated into an expression vector, which is
   used to transform an E. coli host based on strain 52 (W3110 fuhA(tonA) lon galE rpoHts(htpRts)
   clpP(laclq).            Transformants are first grown in LB containing 50 mg/ml carbenicillin at 30/C with
30 shaking until an O.D.600 of 3-5 is reached. Cultures are then diluted 50-100 fold into CRAP media
   (prepared by mixing 3.57 g (NH4 ) 2 SO 4 , 0.71 g sodium citrateA2H 20, 1.07 g KCl, 5.36 g Difco yeast
   extract, 5.36 g Sheffield hycase SF in 500 mL water, as well as 110 mM MPOS, pH 7.3, 0.55% (w/v)
   glucose and 7 mM MgSO 4 ) and grown for approximately 20-30 hours at 30/C with shaking. Samples
   are removed to verify expression by SDS-PAGE analysis, and the bulk culture is centrifuged to pellet
35 the cells. Cell pellets are frozen until purification and refolding.

            E. coli paste from 0.5 to 1 L fermentations (6-10 g pellets) is resuspended in 10 volumes (w/v)
   in 7 M guanidine, 20 mM Tris, pH 8 buffer. Solid sodium sulfite and sodium tetrathionate is added
   to make final concentrations of 0. 1M and 0.02 M, respectively, and the solution is stirred overnight at
   4'C. This step results in a denatured protein with all cysteine residues blocked by sulfitolization.
 5 The solution is centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman Ultracentifuge for 30 min. The supernatant
   is diluted with 3-5 volumes of metal chelate column buffer (6 M guanidine, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4) and
   filtered through 0.22 micron filters to clarify. Depending on the condition, the clarified extract is
   loaded onto a 5 ml Qiagen Ni-NTA metal chelate column equilibrated in the metal chelate column
   buffer.       The column is washed with additional buffer containing 50 mM imidazole (Calbiochem,
10 Utrol grade), pH 7.4. The protein is eluted with buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. Fractions
   containing the desired protein were pooled and stored at 4/C. Protein concentration is estimated by
   its absorbance at 280 nm using the calculated extinction coefficient based on its amino acid sequence.
            The proteins are refolded by diluting sample slowly into freshly prepared refolding buffer
   consisting of: 20 mM Tris, pH 8.6, 0.3 M NaCl, 2.5 M urea, 5 mM cysteine, 20 mM glycine and 1
15 mM EDTA. Refolding volumes are chosen so that the final protein concentration is between 50 to
    100 micrograms/ml. The refolding solution is stirred gently at 4'C for 12-36 hours. The refolding
   reaction is quenched by the addition of TFA to a final concentration of 0.4% (pH of approximately
   3). Before further purification of the protein, the solution is filtered through a 0.22 micron filter and
   acetonitrile is added to 2-10% final concentration. The refolded protein is chromatographed on a
20 Poros RI/H reversed phase column using a mobile buffer of 0.1% TFA with elution with a gradient
   of acetonitrile from 10 to 80%. Aliquots of fractions with A280 absorbance are analyzed on SDS
   polyacrylamide gels and fractions containing homogeneous refolded protein are pooled. Generally,
   the properly refolded species of most proteins are eluted at the lowest concentrations of acetonitrile
   since those species are the most compact with their hydrophobic interiors shielded from interaction
25 with the reversed phase resin.                   Aggregated species are usually eluted at higher acetonitrile
   concentrations.               In addition to resolving misfolded forms of proteins from the desired form, the
   reversed phase step also removes endotoxin from the samples.
            Fractions containing the desired folded anti-PD-Li antibodies are pooled and the acetonitrile
   removed using a gentle stream of nitrogen directed at the solution. Proteins are formulated into 20
30 mM Hepes, pH 6.8 with 0.14 M sodium chloride and 4% mannitol by dialysis or by gel filtration
   using G25 Superfine (Pharmacia) resins equilibrated in the formulation buffer and sterile filtered.
