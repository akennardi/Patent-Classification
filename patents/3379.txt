Typically when a Split System Air Conditioning System is roof mounted there is a requirement to
carry the services for this unit through the roof and into the ceiling cavity. Despite attempts to seal
around the conduits and pipes carrying these services, rain water will often travel down between
and or around these fittings. This ingress of rain water can result in severe damage to ceilings and
surrounds.
The sheaving of the services from a point beyond the horizontal plane, over the top and continuing
down to seal onto the rubber boot covering the roof entry point eliminates the travel path for water.
