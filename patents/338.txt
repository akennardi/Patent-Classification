                                            ABSTRACT
         A wearable device includes a sensor, auxiliary electronics, a primary power supply
configured to harvest radio frequency (RF) radiation received from an external reader and use
the harvested RF radiation to power the sensor, and an auxiliary power supply configured to
harvest energy other than that received from the external reader and use the harvested energy
to supply power to the sensor and/or the auxiliary electronics.     The external reader may
supply less power in response to operation of the auxiliary power supply. Additionally or
alternatively, in response to a determination that the auxiliary power supply is unable to
supply power, the wearable device may disable all auxiliary electronics but for the sensor. In
response to a determination that the primary power supply is unable to supply power but the
auxiliary power supply is able to supply power, the wearable device may retain operating
parameters in the memory storage unit using the auxiliary power supply.

[0001] This application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No.
<removed-apn>, filed on 16 November 2016, the contents of which are hereby incorporated in its
entirety. This application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 14/028,196, filed
September 16, 2013, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
                                        BACKGROUND
[0002] Unless otherwise indicated herein, the materials described in this section are not prior
art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this
section.
[0003] An electrochemical amperometric sensor measures a concentration of an analyte by
measuring a current generated through electrochemical oxidation or reduction reactions of the
analyte at a working electrode of the sensor. A reduction reaction occurs when electrons are
transferred from the electrode to the analyte, whereas an oxidation reaction occurs when
electrons are transferred from the analyte to the electrode. The direction of the electron
transfer is dependent upon the electrical potentials applied to the working electrode. A
counter electrode and/or reference electrode is used to complete a circuit with the working
electrode and allow the generated current to flow. When the working electrode is
appropriately biased, the output current can be proportional to the reaction rate, so as to
provide a measure of the concentration of the analyte surrounding the working electrode.
[0004] In some examples, a reagent is localized proximate the working electrode to
selectively react with a desired analyte. For example, glucose oxidase can be fixed near the
working electrode to react with glucose and release hydrogen peroxide, which is then
electrochemically detected by the working electrode to indicate the presence of glucose.
Other enzymes and/or reagents can be used to detect other analytes.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0022] In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying figures,
which form a part hereof. In the figures, similar symbols typically identify similar
components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the
detailed description, figures, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments
may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the scope of the
subject matter presented herein. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present
disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the figures, can be arranged,
substituted, combined, separated, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations,
all of which are explicitly contemplated herein.
16179131_1

                                                 5
[0023] An ophthalmic sensing platform or implantable sensing platform can include a sensor,
control electronics and an antenna all situated on a substrate embedded in a polymeric
material. The polymeric material can be incorporated in an ophthalmic device, such as an
eye-mountable device or an implantable medical device. The control electronics can operate
the sensor to perform readings and can operate the antenna to wirelessly communicate the
readings from the sensor to an external reader via the antenna.
[0024] In some examples, the polymeric material can be in the form of a round lens with a
concave curvature configured to mount to a corneal surface of an eye. The substrate can be
embedded near the periphery of the polymeric material to avoid interference with incident
light received closer to the central region of the cornea. The sensor can be arranged on the
substrate to face inward, toward the corneal surface, so as to generate clinically relevant
readings from near the surface of the cornea and/or from tear fluid interposed between the
polymeric material and the corneal surface. Additionally or alternatively, the sensor can be
arranged on the substrate to face outward, away from the corneal surface and toward the layer
of tear fluid coating the surface of the polymeric material exposed to the atmosphere. In
some examples, the sensor is entirely embedded within the polymeric material. For example,
an electrochemical sensor that includes a working electrode and a reference electrode can be
embedded in the polymeric material and situated such that the sensor electrodes are less than
10 micrometers from the polymeric surface configured to mount to the cornea. The sensor
can generate an output signal indicative of a concentration of an analyte that diffuses through
the lens material to the sensor electrodes.
[0025] The ophthalmic sensing platform can be powered via radiated energy harvested at the
sensing platform. Power can be provided by light energizing photovoltaic cells included on
the sensing platform. Additionally or alternatively, power can be provided by radio
frequency energy harvested from the antenna. A rectifier and/or regulator can be
incorporated with the control electronics to generate a stable DC voltage to power the sensing
platform from the harvested energy. The antenna can be arranged as a loop of conductive
material with leads connected to the control electronics. In some embodiments, such a loop
antenna can also wirelessly communicate the sensor readings to an external reader by
modifying the impedance of the loop antenna so as to modify backscatter radiation from the
antenna.
16179131_1

                                                 6
[0026] Tear fluid contains a variety of inorganic electrolytes (e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-), organic
components (e.g., glucose, lactate, proteins, lipids, etc.), and so on that can be used to
diagnose health states. An ophthalmic sensing platform configured to measure one or more
of these analytes can thus provide a convenient non-invasive platform useful in diagnosing
and/or monitoring health states. For example, an ophthalmic sensing platform can be
configured to sense glucose and can be used by diabetic individuals to measure/monitor their
glucose levels.
[0027] The sensing platform can be powered by an energy harvesting system to capture
energy from incident radiation, rather than by internal energy storage devices requiring more
space. For example, power can be provided by light energizing photovoltaic cells included
on the sensing platform. Power may also be provided by radio frequency (RF) energy
harvested via a loop antenna. A rectifier and/or regulator can be incorporated with the
control electronics to generate a stable DC voltage to power the sensing platform from the
harvested RF energy. Furthermore, the control electronics can wirelessly communicate the
sensor readings to an external reader by modifying the impedance of the loop antenna so as to
characteristically modify the backscatter from the antenna.
II. Example Ophthalmic Electronics Platform
[0028] Figure 1 is a block diagram of a system 100 that includes an eye-mountable device
110 in wireless communication with an external reader 180. The exposed regions of the eye
mountable device 110 are made of a polymeric material 120 formed to be contact-mounted to
a corneal surface of an eye. A substrate 130 is embedded in the polymeric material 120 to
provide a mounting surface for a power supplies 140a and 14b, a controller 150, bio
interactive electronics 160, and a communication antenna 170. The bio-interactive
electronics 160 are operated by the controller 150. Power supplies 140a and 140b supply
operating voltages to the controller 150 and/or the bio-interactive electronics 160. The
antenna 170 is operated by the controller 150 to communicate information to and/or from the
eye-mountable device 110. The antenna 170, the controller 150, power supply 140a, power
supply 140b, and the bio-interactive electronics 160 can all be situated on the embedded
substrate 130. Because the eye-mountable device 110 includes electronics and is configured
to be contact-mounted to an eye, it is also referred to herein as an ophthalmic electronics
platform.
16179131_1

                                                 7
[0029] To facilitate contact-mounting, the polymeric material 120 can have a concave surface
configured to adhere ("mount") to a moistened corneal surface (e.g., by capillary forces with
a tear film coating the corneal surface). Additionally or alternatively, the eye-mountable
device 110 can be adhered by a vacuum force between the corneal surface and the polymeric
material due to the concave curvature. While mounted with the concave surface against the
eye, the outward-facing surface of the polymeric material 120 can have a convex curvature
that is formed to not interfere with eye-lid motion while the eye-mountable device 110 is
mounted to the eye. For example, the polymeric material 120 can be a substantially
transparent curved polymeric disk shaped similarly to a contact lens.
[0030] The polymeric material 120 can include one or more biocompatible materials, such as
those employed for use in contact lenses or other ophthalmic applications involving direct
contact with the corneal surface. The polymeric material 120 can optionally be formed in
part from such biocompatible materials or can include an outer coating with such
biocompatible materials. The polymeric material 120 can include materials configured to
moisturize the corneal surface, such as hydrogels and the like. In some embodiments, the
polymeric material 120 can be a deformable ("non-rigid") material to enhance wearer
comfort. In some embodiments, the polymeric material 120 can be shaped to provide a
predetermined, vision-correcting optical power, such as can be provided by a contact lens.
[0031] The substrate 130 includes one or more surfaces suitable for mounting the bio
interactive electronics 160, the controller 150, the power supplies 140a and 140b, and the
antenna 170. The substrate 130 can be employed both as a mounting platform for chip-based
circuitry (e.g., by flip-chip mounting to connection pads) and/or as a platform for patterning
conductive materials (e.g., gold, platinum, palladium, titanium, copper, aluminum, silver,
metals, other conductive materials, combinations of these, etc.) to create electrodes,
interconnects, connection pads, antennae, etc. In some embodiments, substantially
transparent conductive materials (e.g., indium tin oxide) can be patterned on the substrate 130
to form circuitry, electrodes, etc. For example, the antenna 170 can be formed by forming a
pattern of gold or another conductive material on the substrate 130 by deposition,
photolithography, electroplating, etc. Similarly, interconnects 151, 157 between the
controller 150 and the bio-interactive electronics 160, and between the controller 150 and the
antenna 170, respectively, can be formed by depositing suitable patterns of conductive
materials on the substrate 130. A combination of microfabrication techniques including,
16179131_1

                                                 8
without limitation, the use of photoresists, masks, deposition techniques, and/or plating
techniques can be employed to pattern materials on the substrate 130. The substrate 130 can
be a relatively rigid material, such as polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") or another material
configured to structurally support the circuitry and/or chip-based electronics within the
polymeric material 120. The eye-mountable device 110 can alternatively be arranged with a
group of unconnected substrates rather than a single substrate. For example, the controller
150 and a bio-sensor or other bio-interactive electronic component can be mounted to one
substrate, while the antenna 170 is mounted to another substrate and the two can be
electrically connected via the interconnects 157.
[0032] In some embodiments, the bio-interactive electronics 160 (and the substrate 130) can
be positioned away from the center of the eye-mountable device 110 and thereby avoid
interference with light transmission to the central, light-sensitive region of the eye. For
example, where the eye-mountable device 110 is shaped as a concave-curved disk, the
substrate 130 can be embedded around the periphery (e.g., near the outer circumference) of
the disk. In some embodiments, however, the bio-interactive electronics 160 (and the
substrate 130) can be positioned in or near the central region of the eye-mountable device
110. Additionally or alternatively, the bio-interactive electronics 160 and/or substrate 130
can be substantially transparent to incoming visible light to mitigate interference with light
transmission to the eye. Moreover, in some embodiments, the bio-interactive electronics 160
can include a pixel array 164 that emits and/or transmits light to be received by the eye
according to display instructions. Thus, the bio-interactive electronics 160 can optionally be
positioned in the center of the eye-mountable device so as to generate perceivable visual cues
to a wearer of the eye-mountable device 110, such as by displaying information (e.g.,
characters, symbols, flashing patterns, etc.) on the pixel array 164.
[0033] The substrate 130 can be shaped as a flattened ring with a radial width dimension
sufficient to provide a mounting platform for the embedded electronics components. The
substrate 130 can have a thickness sufficiently small to allow the substrate 130 to be
embedded in the polymeric material 120 without influencing the profile of the eye-mountable
device 110. The substrate 130 can have a thickness sufficiently large to provide structural
stability suitable for supporting the electronics mounted thereon. For example, the substrate
130 can be shaped as a ring with a diameter of about 10 millimeters, a radial width of about 1
millimeter (e.g., an outer radius 1 millimeter larger than an inner radius), and a thickness of
16179131_1

                                                 9
about 50 micrometers. The substrate 130 can optionally be aligned with the curvature of the
eye-mounting surface of the eye-mountable device 110 (e.g., convex surface). For example,
the substrate 130 can be shaped along the surface of an imaginary cone between two circular
segments that define an inner radius and an outer radius. In such an example, the surface of
the substrate 130 along the surface of the imaginary cone defines an inclined surface that is
approximately aligned with the curvature of the eye mounting surface at that radius.
[0034] Power supply 140a is configured to harvest energy to power the controller 150 and
bio-interactive electronics 160. For example, a radio-frequency energy-harvesting antenna
142 can capture energy from incident radio radiation. The energy harvesting antenna 142 can
optionally be a dual-purpose antenna that is also used to communicate information to the
external reader 180. That is, the functions of the communication antenna 170 and the energy
harvesting antenna 142 can be accomplished with the same physical antenna.
[0035] Power supply 140b is also configured to harvest energy to power the controller 150
and bio-interactive electronics 160; however, power supply 140b is configured to harvest
ambient energy other than incident radio radiation. For example, in the embodiment depicted
in Figure 1, power supply 140b may include solar cell(s) 144 ("photovoltaic cells") that can
capture energy from incoming ultraviolet, visible, and/or infrared radiation. However, in
other embodiments, other types of power sources can be used. For instance, in one example
embodiment, power supply 140b may include an inertial power scavenging system that
captures energy from ambient vibrations. In another example embodiment, power supply
140b may include a biofuel cell that generates electrical energy in response to chemical
reactions occurring at the biofuel cell. Tear fluid may be used as the fuel for such chemical
reactions, although other fuels are possible as well. Alternatively or additionally, power
supply 140b may include one or more charge storage devices, such as rechargeable batteries
or capacitor arrangements. Other types of power supplies are possible as well.
[0036] Rectifier/regulators 146a and 146b can be used to condition the captured energy to
stable DC supply voltages 141a and 141b that are supplied to the controller 150. For
example, the energy harvesting antenna 142 can receive incident radio frequency radiation.
Varying electrical signals on the leads of the antenna 142 are output to the rectifier/regulator
146a. The rectifier/regulator 146a rectifies the varying electrical signals to a DC voltage and
regulates the rectified DC voltage to a level suitable for operating the controller 150.
16179131_1

                                                10
Additionally, output voltage from the solar cell(s) 144 or other types of energy
capture/storage devices can be regulated to a level suitable for operating the controller 150.
The rectifier/regulator 146a and 146b can itself include one or more energy storage devices to
mitigate high frequency variations in the ambient energy gathering antenna 142 and/or solar
cell(s) 144. For example, one or more energy storage devices (e.g., a capacitor, an inductor,
etc.) can be connected in parallel across the outputs of the rectifier 146a and/or 146b to
regulate the DC supply voltages 141a and 141b and configured to function as a low-pass
filter.
[0037] Additionally or alternatively, power supply 140b may include a DC-DC converter that
may convert a larger (or smaller) voltage supplied from photovoltaic cells 144, an inertial
power scavenging system, a biofuel cell, and/or a charge storage device, as the case may be,
to a more suitable unregulated voltage. In one example, the DC-DC converter may convert a
5V DC supply to 1.2V DC, thereby yielding additional power savings before it is regulated.
Other examples of voltage conversion are possible as well.
[0038] The controller 150 is turned on when the DC supply voltage 141a or 141b is provided
to the controller 150, and the logic in the controller 150 operates the bio-interactive
electronics 160 and the antenna 170. The controller 150 can include logic circuitry
configured to operate the bio-interactive electronics 160 so as to interact with a biological
environment of the eye-mountable device 110. The interaction could involve the use of one
or more components, such an analyte bio-sensor 162, in bio-interactive electronics 160 to
obtain input from the biological environment. Additionally or alternatively, the interaction
could involve the use of one or more components, such as pixel array 164, to provide an
output to the biological environment.
[0039] In one example, the controller 150 includes a sensor interface module 152 that is
configured to operate analyte bio-sensor 162. The analyte bio-sensor 162 can be, for
example, an amperometric electrochemical sensor that includes a working electrode and a
reference electrode. A voltage can be applied between the working and reference electrodes
to cause an analyte to undergo an electrochemical reaction (e.g., a reduction and/or oxidation
reaction) at the working electrode. The electrochemical reaction can generate an
amperometric current that can be measured through the working electrode. The
amperometric current can be dependent on the analyte concentration. Thus, the amount of
16179131_1

                                                 11
the amperometric current that is measured through the working electrode can provide an
indication of analyte concentration. In some embodiments, the sensor interface module 152
can be a potentiostat configured to apply a voltage difference between working and reference
electrodes while measuring a current through the working electrode.
[0040] The controller 150 can optionally include a display driver module 154 for operating a
pixel array 164. The pixel array 164 can be an array of separately programmable light
transmitting, light reflecting, and/or light emitting pixels arranged in rows and columns. The
individual pixel circuits can optionally include liquid crystal technologies,
microelectromechanical technologies, emissive diode technologies, etc. to selectively
transmit, reflect, and/or emit light according to information from the display driver module
154. Such a pixel array 164 can also optionally include more than one color of pixels (e.g.,
red, green, and blue pixels) to render visual content in color. The display driver module 154
can include, for example, one or more data lines providing programming information to the
separately programmed pixels in the pixel array 164 and one or more addressing lines for
setting groups of pixels to receive such programming information. Such a pixel array 164
situated on the eye can also include one or more lenses to direct light from the pixel array to a
focal plane perceivable by the eye.
[0041] The controller 150 can also include a communication circuit 156 for sending and/or
receiving information via the antenna 170. The communication circuit 156 can optionally
include one or more oscillators, mixers, frequency injectors, etc. to modulate and/or
demodulate information on a carrier frequency to be transmitted and/or received by the
antenna 170. In some examples, the eye-mountable device 110 is configured to indicate an
output from a bio-sensor by modulating an impedance of the antenna 170 in a manner that is
perceivable by the external reader 180. For example, the communication circuit 156 can
cause variations in the amplitude, phase, and/or frequency of backscatter radiation from the
antenna 170, and such variations can be detected by the reader 180.
[0042] The controller 150 is connected to the bio-interactive electronics 160 via
interconnects 151. For example, where the controller 150 includes logic elements
implemented in an integrated circuit to form the sensor interface module 152 and/or display
driver module 154, a patterned conductive material (e.g., gold, platinum, palladium, titanium,
copper, aluminum, silver, metals, combinations of these, etc.) can connect a terminal on the
16179131_1

                                                12
chip to the bio-interactive electronics 160. Similarly, the controller 150 is connected to the
antenna 170 via interconnects 157.
[0043] The controller 150 can also include logic configured to couple to and operate other
auxiliary electronics 166 that may be mounted on substrate 130. For instance, auxiliary
electronics 166 can include a radio transceiver, configured to communicate via Bluetooth,
WiFi, cellular, or another type of communications protocol. Additionally or alternatively,
auxiliary electronics 166 can include a type of memory storage, such a volatile or non
volatile memory. Other types of auxiliary electronics are possible as well. Controller 150 is
connected to the auxiliary electronics via interconnects 153.
[0044] It is noted that the block diagram shown in Figure 1 is described in connection with
functional modules for convenience in description. However, embodiments of the eye
mountable device 110 can be arranged with one or more of the functional modules ("sub
systems") implemented in a single chip, integrated circuit, and/or physical component. For
example, while rectifier/regulators 146a and 146b are illustrated in power supply blocks 140a
and 14b, respectively, the rectifier/regulators 146a and 146b can be implemented in a chip
that also includes the logic elements of the controller 150 and/or other features of the
embedded electronics in the eye-mountable device 110. Thus, the DC supply voltage 141a or
141b that is provided to the controller 150 from power supplies 140a or 140b can be a supply
voltage that is provided to components on a chip by rectifier and/or regulator components
located on the same chip. That is, the functional blocks in Figure 1 shown as the power
supply blocks 140a and 140b and controller block 150 need not be implemented as physically
separated modules. Moreover, one or more of the functional modules described in Figure 1
can be implemented by separately packaged chips electrically connected to one another.
[0045] Additionally or alternatively, the energy harvesting antenna 142 and the
communication antenna 170 can be implemented with the same physical antenna. For
example, a loop antenna can both harvest incident radiation for power generation and
communicate information via backscatter radiation.
[0046] The external reader 180 includes an antenna 188 (or a group of more than one
antennae) to send and receive wireless signals 171 to and from the eye-mountable device 110.
The external reader 180 also includes a computing system with a processor 186 in
16179131_1

                                                13
communication with a memory 182. The memory 182 is a non-transitory computer-readable
medium that can include, without limitation, magnetic disks, optical disks, organic memory,
and/or any other volatile (e.g. RAM) or non-volatile (e.g. ROM) storage system readable by
the processor 186. The memory 182 can include a data storage 183 to store indications of
data, such as sensor readings (e.g., from the analyte bio-sensor 162), program settings (e.g., to
adjust behavior of the eye-mountable device 110 and/or external reader 180), etc. The
memory 182 can also include program instructions 184 for execution by the processor 186 to
cause the external reader 180 to perform processes specified by the instructions 184. For
example, the program instructions 184 can cause external reader 180 to provide a user
interface that allows for retrieving information communicated from the eye-mountable device
110 (e.g., sensor outputs from the analyte bio-sensor 162). The external reader 180 can also
include one or more hardware components for operating the antenna 188 to send and receive
the wireless signals 171 to and from the eye-mountable device 110. For example, oscillators,
frequency injectors, encoders, decoders, amplifiers, filters, etc. can drive the antenna 188
according to instructions from the processor 186.
[0047] The external reader 180 can be a smart phone, digital assistant, or other portable
computing device with wireless connectivity sufficient to provide the wireless
communication link 171. The external reader 180 can also be implemented as an antenna
module that can be plugged in to a portable computing device, such as in an example where
the communication link 171 operates at carrier frequencies not commonly employed in
portable computing devices. In some instances, the external reader 180 is a special-purpose
device configured to be worn relatively near a wearer's eye to allow the wireless
communication link 171 to operate with a low power budget. For example, the external
reader 180 can be integrated in a piece of jewelry such as a necklace, hearing, etc. or integrated
in an article of clothing worn near the head, such as a hat, headband, etc.
[0048] In some embodiments, the system 100 can operate to non-continuously
("intermittently") supply energy to the eye-mountable device 110 to power the controller 150
and electronics 160. For example, radio frequency radiation 171 can be supplied to power
the eye-mountable device 110 long enough to carry out a tear film analyte concentration
measurement and communicate the results. For example, the supplied radio frequency
radiation can provide sufficient power to apply a potential between a working electrode and a
reference electrode sufficient to induce electrochemical reactions at the working electrode,
16179131_1

                                                  14
measure the resulting amperometric current, and modulate the antenna impedance to adjust
the backscatter radiation in a manner indicative of the measured amperometric current. In
such an example, the supplied radio frequency radiation 171 can be considered an
interrogation signal from the external reader 180 to the eye-mountable device 110 to request a
measurement. By periodically interrogating the eye-mountable device 110 (e.g., by
supplying radio frequency radiation 171 to temporarily turn the device on) and storing the
sensor results (e.g., via the data storage 183), the external reader 180 can accumulate a set of
analyte concentration measurements over time without continuously powering the eye
mountable device 110.
[0049] Further, some embodiments of the system may include privacy controls which may be
automatically implemented or controlled by the wearer of the device. For example, in
embodiments in which a wearer's collected physiological parameter data and health state data
are uploaded to a cloud computing network for trend analysis by a clinician, the data may be
treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable
information is removed. For example, a wearer's identity may be treated so that no
personally identifiable information can be determined for the wearer, or a wearer's
geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a
city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
[0050] Additionally or alternatively, wearers of a device may be provided with an
opportunity to control whether or how the device collects information about the wearer (e.g.,
information about a user's medical history, social actions or activities, profession, a wearer's
preferences, or a wearer's current location), or to control how such information may be used.
Thus, the wearer may have control over how information is collected about him or her and
used by a clinician or physician or other user of the data. For example, a wearer may elect
that data, such as health state and physiological parameters, collected from his or her device
may only be used for generating an individual baseline and recommendations in response to
collection and comparison of his or her own data and may not be used in generating a
population baseline or for use in population correlation studies.
[0051] Figure 2A is a bottom view of an example eye-mountable electronic device 210 (or
ophthalmic electronics platform). Figure 2B is an aspect view of the example eye-mountable
electronic device shown in Figure 2A. It is noted that relative dimensions in Figures 2A and
16179131_1

                                               15
2B are not necessarily to scale, but have been rendered for purposes of explanation only in
describing the arrangement of the example eye-mountable electronic device 210. The eye
mountable device 210 is formed of a polymeric material 220 shaped as a curved disk. The
polymeric material 220 can be a substantially transparent material to allow incident light to
be transmitted to the eye while the eye-mountable device 210 is mounted to the eye. The
polymeric material 220 can be a biocompatible material similar to those employed to form
vision correction and/or cosmetic contact lenses in optometry, such as polyethylene
terephthalate ("PET"), polymethyl methacrylate ("PMMA"), polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate
("polyHEMA"), silicone hydrogels, combinations of these, etc. The polymeric material 220
can be formed with one side having a concave surface 226 suitable to fit over a corneal
surface of an eye. The opposite side of the disk can have a convex surface 224 that does not
interfere with eyelid motion while the eye-mountable device 210 is mounted to the eye. A
circular outer side edge 228 connects the concave surface 224 and convex surface 226.
[0052] The eye-mountable device 210 can have dimensions similar to a vision correction
and/or cosmetic contact lenses, such as a diameter of approximately 1 centimeter, and a
thickness of about 0.1 to about 0.5 millimeters. However, the diameter and thickness values
are provided for explanatory purposes only. In some embodiments, the dimensions of the
eye-mountable device 210 can be selected according to the size and/or shape of the corneal
surface of the wearer's eye.
[0053] The polymeric material 220 can be formed with a curved shape in a variety of ways.
For example, techniques similar to those employed to form vision-correction contact lenses,
such as heat molding, injection molding, spin casting, etc. can be employed to form the
polymeric material 220. While the eye-mountable device 210 is mounted in an eye, the
convex surface 224 faces outward to the ambient environment while the concave surface 226
faces inward, toward the corneal surface. The convex surface 224 can therefore be
considered an outer, top surface of the eye-mountable device 210 whereas the concave
surface 226 can be considered an inner, bottom surface. The "bottom" view shown in Figure
2A is facing the concave surface 226. From the bottom view shown in Figure 2A, the outer
periphery 222, near the outer circumference of the curved disk is curved to extend out of the
page, whereas the central region 221, near the center of the disk is curved to extend into the
page.
16179131_1

                                                 16
[0054] A substrate 230 is embedded in the polymeric material 220. The substrate 230 can be
embedded to be situated along the outer periphery 222 of the polymeric material 220, away
from the central region 221. The substrate 230 does not interfere with vision because it is too
close to the eye to be in focus and is positioned away from the central region 221 where
incident light is transmitted to the eye-sensing portions of the eye. Moreover, the substrate
230 can be formed of a transparent material to further mitigate effects on visual perception.
[0055] The substrate 230 can be shaped as a flat, circular ring (e.g., a disk with a centered
hole). The flat surface of the substrate 230 (e.g., along the radial width) is a platform for
mounting electronics such as chips (e.g., via flip-chip mounting) and for patterning
conductive materials (e.g., via microfabrication techniques such as photolithography,
deposition, plating, etc.) to form electrodes, antenna(e), and/or interconnections. The
substrate 230 and the polymeric material 220 can be approximately cylindrically symmetric
about a common central axis. The substrate 230 can have, for example, a diameter of about
10 millimeters, a radial width of about 1 millimeter (e.g., an outer radius 1 millimeter greater
than an inner radius), and a thickness of about 50 micrometers. However, these dimensions
are provided for example purposes only, and in no way limit the present disclosure. The
substrate 230 can be implemented in a variety of different form factors, similar to the
discussion of the substrate 130 in connection with Figure 1 above.
[0056] A loop antenna 270, controller 250, and bio-interactive electronics 260 are disposed
on the embedded substrate 230. The controller 250 can be a chip including logic elements
configured to operate the bio-interactive electronics 260 and the loop antenna 270. The
controller 250 is electrically connected to the loop antenna 270 by interconnects 257 also
situated on the substrate 230. Similarly, the controller 250 is electrically connected to the
bio-interactive electronics 260 by an interconnect 251. The interconnects 251, 257, the loop
antenna 270, and any conductive electrodes (e.g., for an electrochemical analyte bio-sensor,
etc.) can be formed from conductive materials patterned on the substrate 230 by a process for
precisely patterning such materials, such as deposition, photolithography, etc. The
conductive materials patterned on the substrate 230 can be, for example, gold, platinum,
palladium, titanium, carbon, aluminum, copper, silver, silver-chloride, conductors formed
from noble materials, metals, combinations of these, etc.
16179131_1

                                                17
[0057] As shown in Figure 2A, which is a view facing the concave surface 226 of the eye
mountable device 210, the bio-interactive electronics module 260 is mounted to a side of the
substrate 230 facing the concave surface 226. Where the bio-interactive electronics module
260 includes an analyte bio-sensor, for example, mounting such a bio-sensor on the substrate
230 to be close to the concave surface 226 allows the bio-sensor to sense analyte
concentrations in tear film near the surface of the eye. However, the electronics, electrodes,
etc. situated on the substrate 230 can be mounted to either the "inward" facing side (e.g.,
situated closest to the concave surface 226) or the "outward" facing side (e.g., situated closest
to the convex surface 224). Moreover, in some embodiments, some electronic components
can be mounted on one side of the substrate 230, while other electronic components are
mounted to the opposing side, and connections between the two can be made through
conductive materials passing through the substrate 230.
[0058] The loop antenna 270 is a layer of conductive material patterned along the flat surface
of the substrate to form a flat conductive ring. In some instances, the loop antenna 270 can
be formed without making a complete loop. For instances, the antenna 270 can have a cutout
to allow room for the controller 250 and bio-interactive electronics 260, as illustrated in
Figure 2A. However, the loop antenna 270 can also be arranged as a continuous strip of
conductive material that wraps entirely around the flat surface of the substrate 230 one or
more times. For example, a strip of conductive material with multiple windings can be
patterned on the side of the substrate 230 opposite the controller 250 and bio-interactive
electronics 260. Interconnects between the ends of such a wound antenna (e.g., the antenna
leads) can then be passed through the substrate 230 to the controller 250.
[0059] Figure 2C is a side cross-section view of the example eye-mountable electronic device
210 while mounted to a comeal surface 22 of an eye 10. Figure 2D is a close-in side cross
section view enhanced to show the tear film layers 40, 42 surrounding the exposed surfaces
224, 226 of the example eye-mountable device 210. It is noted that relative dimensions in
Figures 2C and 2D are not necessarily to scale, but have been rendered for purposes of
explanation only in describing the arrangement of the example eye-mountable electronic
device 210. For example, the total thickness of the eye-mountable device can be about 200
micrometers, while the thickness of the tear film layers 40, 42 can each be about 10
micrometers, although this ratio may not be reflected in the figures. Some aspects are
exaggerated to allow for illustration and facilitate explanation.
16179131_1

                                                 18
[0060] The eye 10 includes a cornea 20 that is covered by bringing the upper eyelid 30 and
lower eyelid 32 together over the top of the eye 10. Incident light is received by the eye 10
through the cornea 20, where light is optically directed to light sensing elements of the eye 10
(e.g., rods and cones, etc.) to stimulate visual perception. The motion of the eyelids 30, 32
distributes a tear film across the exposed corneal surface 22 of the eye 10. The tear film is an
aqueous solution secreted by the lacrimal gland to protect and lubricate the eye 10. When the
eye-mountable device 210 is mounted in the eye 10, the tear film coats both the concave and
convex surfaces 224, 226 with an inner layer 40 (along the concave surface 226) and an outer
layer 42 (along the convex layer 224). The tear film layers 40, 42 can be about 10
micrometers in thickness and together account for about 10 microliters.
[0061] The tear film layers 40, 42 are distributed across the corneal surface 22 and/or the
convex surface 224 by motion of the eyelids 30, 32. For example, the eyelids 30, 32 raise
and lower, respectively, to spread a small volume of tear film across the corneal surface 22
and/or the convex surface 224 of the eye-mountable device 210. The tear film layer 40 on the
corneal surface 22 also facilitates mounting the eye-mountable device 210 by capillary forces
between the concave surface 226 and the corneal surface 22. In some embodiments, the eye
mountable device 210 can also be held over the eye in part by vacuum forces against corneal
surface 22 due to the concave curvature of the eye-facing concave surface 226.
[0062] As shown in the cross-sectional views in Figures 2C and 2D, the substrate 230 can be
inclined such that the flat mounting surfaces of the substrate 230 are approximately parallel to
the adjacent portion of the concave surface 226. As described above, the substrate 230 is a
flattened ring with an inward-facing surface 232 (closer to the concave surface 226 of the
polymeric material 220) and an outward-facing surface 234 (closer to the convex surface
224). The substrate 230 can have electronic components and/or patterned conductive
materials mounted to either or both mounting surfaces 232, 234. As shown in Figure 2D, the
bio-interactive electronics 260, controller 250, and conductive interconnect 251 are mounted
on the inward-facing surface 232 such that the bio-interactive electronics 260 are relatively
closer in proximity to the corneal surface 22 than if they were mounted on the outward-facing
surface 234.
[0063] III.             Example Ophthalmic Electrochemical Analyte Sensor
16179131_1

                                               19
[0064] Figure 3 is a functional block diagram of a system 300 for electrochemically
measuring a tear film analyte concentration. As a general matter, the tear film is an aqueous
layer secreted from the lacrimal gland to coat the eye. The tear film is in contact with the
blood supply through capillaries in the structure of the eye and includes many biomarkers
found in blood that are analyzed to characterize a person's health condition(s). For example,
the tear film includes glucose, calcium, sodium, cholesterol, potassium, other biomarkers, etc.
The biomarker concentrations in the tear film can be systematically different than the
corresponding concentrations of the biomarkers in the blood, but a relationship between the
two concentration levels can be established to map tear film biomarker concentration values
to blood concentration levels. For example, the tear film concentration of glucose can be
established (e.g., empirically determined) to be approximately one tenth the corresponding
blood glucose concentration. Although another ratio relationship and/or a non-ratio
relationship may be used. Thus, measuring tear film analyte concentration levels provides a
non-invasive technique for monitoring biomarker levels in comparison to blood sampling
techniques performed by lancing a volume of blood to be analyzed outside a person's body.
Moreover, the ophthalmic analyte bio-sensor platform disclosed here can be operated
substantially continuously to enable real time monitoring of analyte concentrations.
[0065] The system 300 depicts a select set of components in order to illustrate certain
functionality. It should be understood that system 300 can include other components not
depicted here. As depicted, system 300 includes an eye-mountable device 310 with
embedded electronic components powered by an external reader 340. The eye-mountable
device 310 includes an antenna 312 for capturing radio frequency radiation 341 from the
external reader 340. The eye-mountable device 310 includes a rectifier 314, an energy
storage 316, and regulator 318 for generating power supply voltages 330, 332 to operate the
embedded electronics. The eye-mountable device 310 includes an electrochemical sensor
320 with a working electrode 322 and a reference electrode 323 driven by a sensor interface
321. The eye-mountable device 310 includes hardware logic 324 for communicating results
from the sensor 320 to the external reader 340 by modulating the impedance of the antenna
312. An impedance modulator 325 (shown symbolically as a switch in Figure 3) can be used
to modulate the antenna impedance according to instructions from the hardware logic 324.
Similar to the eye-mountable devices 110, 210 discussed above in connection with Figures 1
and 2, the eye-mountable device 310 can include a mounting substrate embedded within a
polymeric material configured to be mounted to an eye.
16179131_1

                                                20
[0066] The electrochemical sensor 320 can be situated on a mounting surface of such a
substrate proximate the surface of the eye (e.g., corresponding to the bio-interactive
electronics 260 on the inward-facing side 232 of the substrate 230) to measure analyte
concentration in a tear film layer interposed between the eye-mountable device 310 and the
eye (e.g., the inner tear film layer 40 between the eye-mountable device 210 and the corneal
surface 22). In some embodiments, however, an electrochemical sensor can be situated on a
mounting surface of such a substrate distal the surface of the eye (e.g., corresponding to the
outward-facing side 234 of the substrate 230) to measure analyte concentration in a tear film
layer coating the exposed surface of the eye-mountable device 310 (e.g., the outer tear film
layer 42 interposed between the convex surface 224 of the polymeric material 210 and the
atmosphere and/or closed eyelids).
[0067] With reference to Figure 3, the electrochemical sensor 320 measures analyte
concentration by applying a voltage between the electrodes 322, 323 that is sufficient to
cause products of the analyte catalyzed by the reagent to electrochemically react (e.g., a
reduction and/or oxidization reaction) at the working electrode 322. The electrochemical
reactions at the working electrode 322 generate an amperometric current that can be
measured at the working electrode 322. The sensor interface 321 can, for example, apply a
reduction voltage between the working electrode 322 and the reference electrode 323 to
reduce products from the reagent-catalyzed analyte at the working electrode 322.
Additionally or alternatively, the sensor interface 321 can apply an oxidization voltage
between the working electrode 322 and the reference electrode 323 to oxidize the products
from the reagent-catalyzed analyte at the working electrode 322. The sensor interface 321
measures the amperometric current and provides an output to the hardware logic 324. The
sensor interface 321 can include, for example, a potentiostat connected to both electrodes
322, 323 to simultaneously apply a voltage between the working electrode 322 and the
reference electrode 323 and measure the resulting amperometric current through the working
electrode 322.
[0068] The rectifier 314, energy storage 316, and voltage regulator 318 operate to harvest
energy from received radio frequency radiation 341. The radio frequency radiation 341
causes radio frequency electrical signals on leads of the antenna 312. The rectifier 314 is
connected to the antenna leads and converts the radio frequency electrical signals to a DC
voltage. The energy storage 316 (e.g., capacitor) is connected across the output of the
16179131_1

                                                21
rectifier 314 to filter out high frequency components of the DC voltage. The regulator 318
receives the filtered DC voltage and outputs both a digital supply voltage 330 to operate the
hardware logic 324 and an analog supply voltage 332 to operate the electrochemical sensor
320. For example, the analog supply voltage can be a voltage used by the sensor interface
321 to apply a voltage between the sensor electrodes 322, 323 to generate an amperometric
current. The digital supply voltage 330 can be a voltage suitable for driving digital logic
circuitry, such as approximately 1.2 volts, approximately 3 volts, etc. Reception of the radio
frequency radiation 341 from the external reader 340 (or another source, such as ambient
radiation, etc.) causes the supply voltages 330, 332 to be supplied to the sensor 320 and
hardware logic 324. While powered, the sensor 320 and hardware logic 324 are configured
to generate and measure an amperometric current and communicate the results.
[0069] The sensor results can be communicated back to the external reader 340 via
backscatter radiation 343 from the antenna 312. The hardware logic 324 receives the output
current from the electrochemical sensor 320 and modulates (325) the impedance of the
antenna 312 in accordance with the amperometric current measured by the sensor 320. The
antenna impedance and/or change in antenna impedance is detected by the external reader
340 via the backscatter signal 343. The external reader 340 can include an antenna front end
342 and logic components 344 to decode the information indicated by the backscatter signal
343 and provide digital inputs to a processing system 346. The external reader 340 associates
the backscatter signal 343 with the sensor result (e.g., via the processing system 346
according to a pre-programmed relationship associating impedance of the antenna 312 with
output from the sensor 320). The processing system 346 can then store the indicated sensor
results (e.g., tear film analyte concentration values) in a local memory and/or an external
memory (e.g., by communicating with the external memory through a network).
[0070] In some embodiments, one or more of the features shown as separate functional
blocks can be implemented ("packaged") on a single chip. For example, the eye-mountable
device 310 can be implemented with the rectifier 314, energy storage 316, voltage regulator
318, sensor interface 321, and the hardware logic 324 packaged together in a single chip or
controller module. Such a controller can have interconnects ("leads") connected to the loop
antenna 312 and the sensor electrodes 322, 323. Such a controller operates to harvest energy
received at the loop antenna 312, apply a voltage between the electrodes 322, 323 sufficient
16179131_1

to develop an amperometric current, measure the amperometric current, and indicate the
measured current via the antenna 312 (e.g., through the backscatter radiation 343).
[0071] Whereas the device described herein is described as comprising the eye-mountable
device 110 and/or the eye-mountable device 310, the device could comprise other devices
that are mounted on or in other portions of the human body.
[0072] For example, in some embodiments, the body-mountable device may comprise a
tooth-mountable device. In some embodiments, the tooth-mountable device may take the
form of or be similar in form to the eye-mountable device 110 and/or the eye-mountable
device 310. For instance, the tooth-mountable device could include a polymeric material or a
transparent polymer that is the same or similar to any of the polymeric materials or
transparent polymers described herein and a substrate or a structure that is the same or similar
to any of the substrates or structures described herein. With such an arrangement, the tooth
mountable device may be configured to detect at least one analyte in a fluid (e.g., saliva) of a
user wearing the tooth-mountable device.
[0073] Moreover, in some embodiments, the body-mountable device may comprise a skin
mountable device. In some embodiments, the skin-mountable device may take the form of or
be similar in form to the eye-mountable device 110 and/or the eye-mountable device
310. For instance, the skin-mountable device could include a polymeric material or a
transparent polymer that is the same or similar to any of the polymeric materials or
transparent polymers described herein and a substrate or a structure that is the same or similar
to any of the substrates or structures described herein. With such an arrangement, the skin
mountable device may be configured to detect at least one analyte in a fluid (e.g.,
perspiration, blood, etc.) of a user wearing the skin-mountable device.
[0074] Figure 4A is a flowchart of a process 400 for operating an amperometric sensor in an
eye-mountable device to measure a tear film analyte concentration. Radio frequency
radiation is received at an antenna in an eye-mountable device including an embedded
electrochemical sensor (402). Electrical signals due to the received radiation are rectified and
regulated to power the electrochemical sensor and associated controller (404). For example,
a rectifier and/or regulator can be connected to the antenna leads to output a DC supply
voltage for powering the electrochemical sensor and/or controller. A voltage sufficient to
16179131_1

                                                 23
cause electrochemical reactions at the working electrode is applied between a working
electrode and a reference electrode on the electrochemical sensor (406). An amperometric
current is measured through the working electrode (408). For example, a potentiostat can
apply a voltage between the working and reference electrodes while measuring the resulting
amperometric current through the working electrode. The measured amperometric current is
wirelessly indicated with the antenna (410). For example, backscatter radiation can be
manipulated to indicate the sensor result by modulating the antenna impedance.
[0075] Figure 4B is a flowchart of a process 420 for operating an external reader to
interrogate an amperometric sensor in an eye-mountable device to measure a tear film analyte
concentration. Radio frequency radiation is transmitted to an electrochemical sensor
mounted in an eye from the external reader (422). The transmitted radiation is sufficient to
power the electrochemical sensor with energy from the radiation for long enough to perform
a measurement and communicate the results (422). For example, the radio frequency
radiation used to power the electrochemical sensor can be similar to the radiation 341
transmitted from the external reader 340 to the eye-mountable device 310 described in
connection with Figure 3 above. The external reader then receives backscatter radiation
indicating the measurement by the electrochemical analyte sensor (424). For example, the
backscatter radiation can be similar to the backscatter signals 343 sent from the eye
mountable device 310 to the external reader 340 described in connection with Figure 3 above.
The backscatter radiation received at the external reader is then associated with a tear film
analyte concentration (426). In some cases, the analyte concentration values can be stored in
the external reader memory (e.g., in the processing system 346) and/or a network-connected
data storage.
[0076] For example, the sensor result (e.g., the measured amperometric current) can be
encoded in the backscatter radiation by modulating the impedance of the backscattering
antenna. The external reader can detect the antenna impedance and/or change in antenna
impedance based on a frequency, amplitude, and/or phase shift in the backscatter radiation.
The sensor result can then be extracted by associating the impedance value with the sensor
result by reversing the encoding routine employed within the eye-mountable device. Thus,
the reader can map a detected antenna impedance value to an amperometric current value.
The amperometric current value is approximately proportionate to the tear film analyte
concentration with a sensitivity (e.g., scaling factor) relating the amperometric current and
16179131_1

                                                 24
the associated tear film analyte concentration. The sensitivity value can be determined in part
according to empirically derived calibration factors, for example.
IV.     Example Electrochemical Sensor With Dual Power Sources
[0077] Figure 5A is a functional block diagram of an example electrochemical sensor system
500 including a measurement power supply 510 and an auxiliary power supply 520. The
electrochemical sensor system 500 can also include a working electrode 502, a reference
electrode 504, an antenna 522, measurement and communication electronics 524, photocell
526 and auxiliary electronics 528. Although, it is noted the functional block diagram of the
system 500 shown in Figure 5A illustrates separate functional modules, they are not
necessarily implemented as physically distinct modules. For example, the measurement
power supply 510 and measurement and communication electronics 524 can be packaged in a
common chip that includes terminals connected to the antenna 522 and the sensor electrodes
502, 504. Further, while not specifically illustrated, it is noted that a reagent layer can be
provided on or near the working electrode 502 to sensitize the electrochemical sensor to an
analyte of interest. For example, glucose oxidase may be fixed around the working electrode
502 (e.g., by incorporating glucose oxidase in a gel or medium) to cause the electrochemical
sensor system 500 to detect glucose.
[0078] As shown, measurement power supply 510 and auxiliary power supply 520 are
electrically connected to the measurement and control electronics 524 in order to supply
power (e.g., a DC supply voltage) to the system 500. For brevity, the measurement and
control electronics 524 is alternately referred to herein as the "measurement electronics" or
the "measurement module." Generally, the measurement and control electronics 524, which
receive power from the measurement power supply 510 and/or the auxiliary power supply
520, may apply a voltage across the sensor electrodes 502, 504 while obtaining an
amperometric current measurement (e.g., similar to the operation of a potentiostat).
[0079] In accordance with one embodiment, the measurement power supply 510 depicted in
Figure 5A operates to harvest energy from incident radio frequency radiation and generate a
DC supply voltage to turn on the measurement and communication electronics 524, thereby
causing the system 500 to obtain an amperometric current measurement through the working
electrode 502 and communicate the sensor result through antenna 522. The measurement
16179131_1

                                                25
power supply 510 may be a power supply that is dedicated to providing power to the
measurement and control electronics 524. The measurement power supply 510 can generally
be similar to the energy harvesting power supply system described in connection with Figures
1 and 3 and may include one or more rectifiers, energy storage devices, and/or voltage
regulators/conditioners configured to harvest energy in radio frequency electrical signals on
leads of the antenna 522 caused by incident radiation and output a DC supply voltage to
power the measurement and communication electronics 524.
[0080] In accordance with one embodiment, the auxiliary power supply 520 depicted in
Figure 5A operates to harvest energy other than that received from the from the radio
frequency energy harvesting antenna 522. For example, in some embodiments, the auxiliary
power supply 520 may comprise a photovoltaic cell (e.g., the photovoltaic cell 526) that
outputs a voltage across two terminals in response to incident light radiation. The terminals
of the photovoltaic cell 526 can then be connected to the measurement and communication
electronics 524, so that voltage output from the photovoltaic cell 526 can turn on the
measurement and communication electronics 524, thereby causing the system 500 to obtain
an amperometric current measurement through the working electrode 502.
[0081] The photovoltaic cell 526 can be, for example, a solar cell or a combination of such
solar cells. The photovoltaic cell can be activated in response to the receipt of light at a range
of different wavelengths, such as visible light, ultraviolet light, near infrared light, etc.
Although, a particular photovoltaic cell may be configured to be activated at a selected range
of wavelengths as desired. In an embodiment in which the electrochemical sensor is included
in an eye-mountable device (e.g., embedded in a transparent polymeric material configured to
be contact-mounted to an eye surface) the photovoltaic cell 526 can be embedded in the eye
mountable device and can receive incident light radiation that is transmitted through the eye
mountable device.
[0082] In other embodiments, however, the auxiliary power supply 520 is additionally or
alternatively powered via another energy harvesting source, such as an inertial motion energy
harvesting system, a biofuel cell, and/or a charge storage device. The biofuel cell may be
configured to facilitate a chemical reaction and generate a responsive electric potential. In
one example, the biofuel cell facilitates oxidation of the ascorbate naturally present in tear
fluid. However, other types of biofuel cells are possible as well. Still additionally, the
16179131_1

                                                26
auxiliary power supply may comprise a charge storage device, such as a rechargeable battery
or an arrangement of capacitors. The charge storage device may be arranged to store electric
charge generated by the photovoltaic cell, inertial motion energy harvesting system, biofuel
cell, antenna, or other charge generating device.
[0083] In some embodiments, the measurement power supply 510 and the auxiliary power
supply 520 include components similar to the voltage regulator and/or rectifier 314, 318
described in connection with Figure 3 that outputs both an analog voltage 332 to the sensor
interface 321, and a DC supply voltage 330 to the circuit logic 324. With reference to the
system 500 in Figure 5A, the voltage applied across the sensor electrodes 502, 504 may be
analogous to the analog voltage output of the energy harvesting system, while the DC supply
voltage provided to the measurement and communication electronics 524 can be analogous to
the digital voltage output of the energy harvesting system. Thus, some embodiments of the
measurement power supply 510 and auxiliary power supply 520 may include a rectifier, a
low-pass filter (e.g., one or more capacitors), and/or voltage regulation/conditioning modules
that may be similar in some respects to the rectifier 314, energy storage 316, and/or voltage
regulator/conditioner 318 described in connection with Figure 3 above.
[0084] The measurement and communication electronics 524 are shown and described in
connection with Figure 5A as a functional module that receives a DC supply voltage, obtains
an amperometric current measurement measured through the working electrode, and then
operates the antenna 522 to communicate the measured current. However, the measurement
and communication electronics may include one or more of the functional modules shown
and described in connection with Figure 3 above, such as a sensor interface (e.g., a
potentiostat), an antenna interface (e.g., a backscatter radiation modulator, one or more
oscillators, etc.), and/or logic elements configured to cause the module 524 to function as
described. Moreover, while the measurement and communication electronics are shown and
described as a single physical module, it is noted that the measurement and communication
electronics 524 can include a combination of one or more modules, or can be combined with
other modules (e.g., rectifier, regulator and/or other related power supply modules) in a single
physical implementation, such as an integrated circuit or chip.
[0085] In accordance with some embodiments, system 500 also includes auxiliary electronics
528. Auxiliary electronics 528 are shown and described in connection with Figure 5A as a
16179131_1

                                                 27
functional module that receives a DC supply voltage from auxiliary power supply 520. The
auxiliary electronics 528 may include one or more of the functional modules shown and
described in connection with Figure 1 above, such a pixel array, radio transceiver, memory
storage, and/or logic elements configured to cause the auxiliary electronics 528 to function as
described. Moreover, while auxiliary electronics 528 are shown as a single physical module,
it is noted that the auxiliary electronics 528 can include a combination of one or more
modules, or can be combined with other modules (e.g., rectifier, regulator and/or other related
power supply modules) in a single physical implementation, such as an integrated circuit or
chip.
[0086] In operation according to some embodiments, system 500 may contain an appropriate
mechanism that operates to determine when the auxiliary power supply 520 is able to provide
power to the system 500 and responsively enable the auxiliary power supply 520. For
example, in embodiments in which the auxiliary power supply is powered by a photovoltaic
cell 526, auxiliary power supply 520 may contain an ambient light detector that operates to
detect the presence of ambient light sufficient enough for the photovoltaic cell 526 to provide
an operating voltage (e.g., 5.0V) to the measurement and communication electronics 524
and/or the auxiliary electronics 528. In embodiments in which the auxiliary power supply is
powered by a biofuel cell, auxiliary power supply 520 may recognize when the biofuel cell is
producing a voltage level (e.g., 5.OV) that is sufficient enough to operate the measurement
and communication electronics 524 and/or the auxiliary electronics 528. In embodiments in
which the auxiliary power supply is powered by a charge storage device, auxiliary power
supply 520 may determine whether the charge storage device has stored a sufficient level of
electric charge (e.g., 5.OV) to operate the measurement and communication electronics 524
and/or the auxiliary electronics 528. In embodiments in which the auxiliary power supply
520 is powered by an inertial motion energy harvesting system, the auxiliary power supply
520 may contain a motion detector that operates to determine when there is motion sufficient
enough for the motion detector to provide an operating voltage (e.g., 5.OV) to the
measurement and communication electronics 524 and/or the auxiliary electronics 528.
However, in other embodiments, other mechanisms for determining whether the auxiliary
power supply 520 is able to provide power to the system 500 are possible as well.
[0087] As mentioned above, in response to determining that the auxiliary power supply 520
is able to provide sufficient power to the communication electronics 524 and/or the auxiliary
16179131_1

                                                 28
electronics 528, the auxiliary power supply 520 may operate to enable the auxiliary power
supply 520. In some embodiments, this is carried out by providing to a switch or other logic
a signal indicative of the availability of the auxiliary power supply 520 to provide power to
the system 500. The switch or other logic may responsively enable and operate the auxiliary
power supply 520 to provide power to the measurement and communication electronics 524
and/or the auxiliary electronics 528 (e.g., by closing a circuit, thereby electrically coupling
the auxiliary power supply to either or both of the measurement and communication
electronics 524 and the auxiliary electronics 528). However, other ways of enabling the
auxiliary power supply 520 are possible as well.
[0088] In practice, opportunistic enabling of auxiliary power supply 520 may have several
operational advantages. For instance, in a situation in which the auxiliary electronics 528 are
being powered by measurement power supply 510, enabling auxiliary power supply 520 may
result in additional power being supplied to the auxiliary electronics 528 from the auxiliary
power supply 520. As such, the additional power may result in an improved performance of
one or more of the auxiliary electronics. For example, when the auxiliary electronics 528
include a Bluetooth radio, providing additional power to the radio may enable the radio to
transmit a farther distance. Other examples of improved performance are possible as well.
[0089] In another example of an operational advantage, enabling auxiliary power supply 520
to provide power to the system 500 may allow the measurement power supply 510 to reduce
the amount of power it supplies to the system 500. As such, while the auxiliary power supply
520 powers the system 500, power may be preserved at the measurement power supply 510
and/or an external reader associated with the measurement power supply 510. In some
embodiments, the auxiliary power supply 520 in conjunction with the measurement and
communication electronics 524 include logic configured for determining whether the
auxiliary power supply 520 is supplying power to the system 500 and responsively causing
the measurement power supply 510 to reduce the amount of power supplied to the system
500. In one example of this, the measurement and communication electronics 524 operate to
characteristically modify RF backscatter at antenna 526 to communicate with an external
reader. Accordingly, this communication may cause the external reader to temporarily
reduce or stop the external reader's transmission of power to the measurement power supply
510. However, other ways of conserving power are possible as well.
16179131_1

                                                29
[0090] In another example of an operational advantage, enabling auxiliary power supply 520
to provide power to auxiliary electronics 528 may allow system 500 to retain an operating
state during periods in which the measurement power supply 510 is unable to provide power
to the system 500. For instance, when auxiliary electronics 528 include a volatile memory
storage unit (i.e., a memory storage unit that loses its contents when power is removed from
the memory storage unit) that stores certain operating parameters (e.g., measurement results),
those parameters may be lost when power is removed from the volatile memory storage unit.
Therefore, when the auxiliary power supply 520 provides power to the volatile memory
storage unit, the operating parameters contained therein may not be lost when the
measurement power supply 510 stops providing power to system 500. In addition, in some
embodiments, system 500 may contain logic configured for determining that the
measurement power supply is (or will soon be) unable to provide power but the auxiliary
power supply is able to provide power. In response to this determination, the system 500
may enable the auxiliary power supply 520 to provide power to the volatile memory storage
unit. In one example, the system 500 determines that the measurement power supply 510 is
(or will soon be) unable to provide power by receiving an instruction (e.g., in the form of RF
radiation received at antenna 522 from an external reader) that indicates that the external
reader is powering down. However, other ways of determining that the measurement power
supply 510 is (or will soon be) unable to provide power are possible as well.
[0091] In operation according to additional or alternative embodiments, system 500 may
contain logic configured for determining an intention to operate auxiliary electronics 528 and
responsively enabling and operating the auxiliary power supply 520 to provide power to the
auxiliary power electronics 528. For instance, system 500 may receive an instruction (e.g., in
the form of RF radiation received at antenna 522 from an external reader) that instructs
system 500 to operate at least part of auxiliary electronics 528, such as pixel array 164. In
response, auxiliary power supply 520 may provide to a switch or other logic a signal
indicative of an intent to operate the auxiliary electronics 528. The switch or other logic may
responsively enable and operate the auxiliary power supply 520 to provide power to the
auxiliary electronics 528 (e.g., by closing a circuit, thereby electrically coupling the auxiliary
power supply to the auxiliary electronics 528). In this way, auxiliary electronics embedded
within the eye-mountable device, such as a Bluetooth radio or a pixel array, can be
opportunistically operated when there is sufficient power able to be harvested from sources
other than the external reader, thereby conserving battery life of the external reader.
16179131_1

                                                 30
[0092] In operation according to additional or alternative embodiments, system 500 may
contain logic configured for determining that the auxiliary power supply is unable to
currently supply power and responsively entering a lower power mode in which the system
500 disables all auxiliary electronics but for the sensor 501. Entering a low power mode,
such as this one, may help the system 500 generally, and the measurement power supply 510
(as well as an associated external reader) in particular, conserve power. Depending on the
embodiment, the system 500 may determine that the auxiliary power supply 520 is unable to
supply power by detecting that there is insufficient light for the photovoltaic cell 526 to
provide an operating voltage (e.g., 5.OV) to the measurement and communication electronics
524 and/or the auxiliary electronics 528, the biofuel cell is not producing a voltage level (e.g.,
5.OV) that is sufficient enough to operate the measurement and communication electronics
524 and/or the auxiliary electronics 528, the charge storage device has stored an insufficient
level of electric charge (e.g., < 5.OV) to operate the measurement and communication
electronics 524 and/or the auxiliary electronics 528, there is not sufficient enough motion for
the motion detector to provide an operating voltage (e.g., 5.OV) to the measurement and
communication electronics 524 and/or the auxiliary electronics 528, or in other ways as well.
[0093] Figure 5B is a flowchart of an example process 530 for operating the example
electrochemical sensor system 500 of Figure 5A. The example process 530 may include one
or more operations, functions, or actions, as depicted by one or more of blocks 532, 534,
and/or 536, each of which may be carried out by any of the systems described herein;
however, other configurations could be used.
[0094] Furthermore, those skilled in the art will understand that flow diagrams described
herein illustrate functionality and operation of certain implementations of example
embodiments. In this regard, each block of each flow diagram may represent a module, a
segment, or a portion of program code, which includes one or more instructions executable
by a processor (e.g., a processor of controller 150 described above with respect to Figure 1)
for implementing specific logical functions or steps in the process. The program code may be
stored on any type of computer readable medium (e.g., computer readable storage medium or
non-transitory media), for example, such as a storage device including a disk or hard drive.
In addition, each block may represent circuitry that is wired to perform the specific logical
functions in the process. Alternative implementations are included within the scope of the
example embodiments of the present application in which functions may be executed out of
16179131_1

                                                31
order from that shown or discussed, including substantially concurrent or in reverse order,
depending on the functionality involved, as would be understood by those reasonably skilled
in the art.
[0095] The process 530 begins at block 532 where the system 500 receives a signal indicative
of the availability of the auxiliary power supply to supply power to the system 500. As
described, in embodiments in which the auxiliary power supply receives power from a
photovoltaic cell, such a signal may take the form of the output of an ambient light detector.
In one example, the signal comprises a determination that the level of ambient light incident
upon the photovoltaic cell is at or above a threshold level of ambient light. Generally, in this
example, the threshold level of ambient light is a level at which the photovoltaic cell and the
auxiliary power supply can provide a sufficient DC voltage (e.g., 5.0 Volts) to operate the
auxiliary electronics and/or the measurement and communication electronics. In
embodiments in which the auxiliary power source receives power from another type of
energy-harvesting device, the signal may be one that is generally indicative of that device's
ability to imminently provide a DC power supply to the auxiliary electronics and/or the
measurement and communication electronics sufficient to power such electronics.
[0096] The process continues at block 534, where the system 500 enables the auxiliary power
supply. As described, in some embodiments, enabling the auxiliary power supply includes a
switch or other actuating device that can electrically couple the auxiliary power supply to the
auxiliary electronics and/or the measurement and communication electronics upon receipt of
the signal described in connection with block 532. And finally, in block 536, the system
operates the auxiliary power supply to provide power to the electrochemical sensor. As
described, in one embodiment, operating the auxiliary power supply to provide power may
include receiving incident light at the photovoltaic cell and converting the light into a DC
supply voltage. In another embodiment, operating the auxiliary power supply to provide
power may include harvesting motion energy and converting such energy into a DC supply
voltage. In other embodiments, other energy harvesting devices are possible and in those
embodiments, operating the auxiliary power supply generally includes converting the
harvested energy into a DC supply voltage.
[0097] Figure 5C is another flowchart of an example process 540 for operating the example
electrochemical sensor system 500 of Figure 5A. The example process 540 may include one
16179131_1

                                                32
or more operations, functions, or actions, as depicted by one or more of blocks 542, 544,
and/or 546, each of which may be carried out by any of the systems described herein;
however, other configurations could be used.
[0098] The process 540 begins at block 542 where the system 500 receives a signal indicative
of an intention to operate an auxiliary device. As described, in embodiments in which the
auxiliary electronics include a pixel array, such a signal may take the form of an instruction
to operate the pixel array. In some embodiments, this instruction may be generated at a
controller of system 500 (e.g., controller 150 described in connection with Figure 1).
Additionally or alternatively, this instruction may be received from an external reader (e.g.,
external reader 180 described in connection with Figure 1).
[0099] The process continues at block 544, where the system 500 enables the auxiliary power
supply. Similar to that described above in connection with block 534 of Figure 5B, the
auxiliary power supply may include a switch or other actuating device that can electrically
couple the auxiliary power supply to the auxiliary electronics and/or the measurement and
communication electronics upon receipt of the signal described in connection with block 542.
And finally, in block 546, similar to that described above in connection with block 536 of
Figure 5B, the system operates the auxiliary power supply to provide power to the auxiliary
device. As described, in one embodiment, operating the auxiliary power supply to provide
power may include receiving incident light at the photovoltaic cell and converting the light
into a DC supply voltage. In another embodiment, operating the auxiliary power supply to
provide power may include harvesting motion energy and converting such energy into a DC
supply voltage. In other embodiments, other energy harvesting devices are possible and in
those embodiments, operating the auxiliary power supply generally includes converting the
harvested energy into a DC supply voltage.
[0100] Figure 5D is a flowchart of an example process 550 for operating the example
electrochemical sensor system 500 of Figure 5A. The example process 550 may include one
or more operations, functions, or actions, as depicted by one or more of blocks 552 and/or
554, each of which may be carried out by any of the systems described herein; however, other
configurations could be used.
16179131_1

                                                 33
[0101] The process 550 begins at block 552 where the system 500 receives a signal indicative
of the inability of the auxiliary power supply to supply power to the system 500. As
described, in embodiments in which the auxiliary power supply receives power from a
photovoltaic cell, such a signal may take the form of the output of an ambient light detector.
In one example, the signal comprises a determination that the level of ambient light incident
upon the photovoltaic cell is below a threshold level of ambient light. Generally, in this
example, the threshold level of ambient light is a level at which the photovoltaic cell and the
auxiliary power supply can provide a sufficient DC voltage (e.g., 5.0 Volts) to operate the
auxiliary electronics and/or the measurement and communication electronics. In
embodiments in which the auxiliary power source receives power from another type of
energy-harvesting device, the signal may be one that is generally indicative of that device's
inability to imminently provide a DC power supply to the auxiliary electronics and/or the
measurement and communication electronics sufficient to power such electronics.
[0102] The process continues at block 554, where the system 500 enters a low power mode in
which it disables all the auxiliary electronics but for the sensor 501. As described, in some
embodiments, entering the low power mode may enable the system 500 generally and the
measurement power supply in particular to conserve power by not having to power the
auxiliary electronics.
[0103] Figure 6 depicts a computer-readable medium configured according to an example
embodiment. In example embodiments, the example system can include one or more
processors, one or more forms of memory, one or more input devices/interfaces, one or more
output devices/interfaces, and machine-readable instructions that when executed by the one
or more processors cause the system to carry out the various functions, tasks, capabilities,
etc., described above.
[0104] As noted above, in some embodiments, the disclosed techniques can be implemented
by computer program instructions encoded on a non-transitory computer-readable storage
media in a machine-readable format, or on other non-transitory media or articles of
manufacture (e.g., the instructions 184 stored on the memory storage 182 of the external
reader 180 of the system 100). Figure 6 is a schematic illustrating a conceptual partial view
of an example computer program product that includes a computer program for executing a

                                                34
computer process on a computing device, arranged according to at least some embodiments
presented herein.
[0105] In one embodiment, the example computer program product 600 is provided using a
signal bearing medium 602. The signal bearing medium 602 may include one or more
programming instructions 604 that, when executed by one or more processors may provide
functionality or portions of the functionality described above with respect to Figures 1-5C. In
some examples, the signal bearing medium 602 can be a non-transitory computer-readable
medium 606, such as, but not limited to, a hard disk drive, a Compact Disc (CD), a Digital
Video Disk (DVD), a digital tape, memory, etc. In some implementations, the signal bearing
medium 602 can be a computer recordable medium 608, such as, but not limited to, memory,
read/write (R/W) CDs, R/W DVDs, etc. In some implementations, the signal bearing
medium 602 can be a communications medium 610, such as, but not limited to, a digital
and/or an analog communication medium (e.g., a fiber optic cable, a waveguide, a wired
communications link, a wireless communication link, etc.). Thus, for example, the signal
bearing medium 602 can be conveyed by a wireless form of the communications medium
610.
[0106] The one or more programming instructions 604 can be, for example, computer
executable and/or logic implemented instructions. In some examples, a computing device
such as the processor-equipped external reader 180 of Figure 1 is configured to provide
various operations, functions, or actions in response to the programming instructions 604
conveyed to the computing device by one or more of the computer readable medium 606, the
computer recordable medium 608, and/or the communications medium 610.
[0107] The non-transitory computer readable medium 606 can also be distributed among
multiple data storage elements, which could be remotely located from each other. The
computing device that executes some or all of the stored instructions could be an external
reader, such as the reader 180 illustrated in Figure 1, or another mobile computing platform,
such as a smartphone, tablet device, personal computer, etc. Alternatively, the computing
device that executes some or all of the stored instructions could be remotely located computer
system, such as a server.

[0108] Where example embodiments involve information related to a person or a device of a
person, some embodiments may include privacy controls. Such privacy controls may
include, at least, anonymization of device identifiers, transparency and user controls,
including functionality that would enable users to modify or delete information relating to the
user's use of a product.
[0109] Further, in situations in where embodiments discussed herein collect personal
information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided
with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g.,
information about a user's medical history, social network, social actions or activities,
profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or
how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In
addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that
personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated
so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's
geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a
city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by
a content server.
