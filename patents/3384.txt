                                                       Background of the Invention
               Ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VTA) refers to a variety of medical conditions
characterized by an abnormally elevated heart rate. When the heart beats excessively rapidly, the
heart pumps less efficiently, and provides less blood flow to the rest of the body. The increased
heart rate also leads to increased work and oxygen demand by the heart, which can lead to rate
related ischemia. Ventricular tachyarrhythmia events are related to sudden deaths, especially in

patients with severe heart disease. Examples of ventricular tachyarrhythmia events include
ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and ventricular flutter. Subjects diagnosed as
having ventricular tachyarrhythmia often receive an implantable cardiac device, e.g., a cardiac
defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization treatment (CRT) device, or a combination ICD
CRT (CRT-D) device. Some subjects having ventricular tachyarrhythmia that receive such a
device demonstrate reduced morbidity and mortality (Scott et al., Europace. 13(10):1419-27
(2011)). Some patients diagnosed with heart failure and receiving standard pharmacological
therapy develop worsening disease, whereby such pharmacological therapy is no longer
sufficient, and device therapy (e.g., ICD, CRT, or CRT-D device) becomes necessary to preserve
these patients' lives Existing guidelines for selecting treatment including an implanted cardiac
device (see, e.g., Epstein et al., Circulation. 117:e350-e408 (2008)) are unable to predict which
subjects will benefit most from device therapy.
                                                       Summary
               The invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that subjects having an elevated
level of soluble ST2 or an increase in soluble ST2 over time have an increased risk of having a
ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VTA) event. Thus, provided herein are methods for selecting a
treatment for a subject that include determining a level of soluble ST2 in a biological sample
from a subject, comparing the level of soluble ST2 in the biological sample to a reference level
of soluble ST2, and selecting an implanted cardiac device, e.g., an ICD, CRT, or CRT-D device,
for a subject having a selected, e.g., elevated, level of soluble ST2 in the biological sample
compared to the reference level of soluble ST2. Also provided are methods of treating a subject
that include determining a level of soluble ST2 in a biological sample from a subject, comparing
the level of soluble ST2 in the biological sample to a reference level of soluble ST2, and
implanting a cardiac device into a subject having an elevated level of soluble ST2 in the
biological sample compared to the reference level of soluble ST2; or altering the programming or
replacing an existing device. Also provided are methods for selecting a subject for participation
in, or stratification of subjects in, a clinical study of a treatment for reducing the risk of a VTA
event, and methods of evaluating the risk of a VTA event in a subject that include determining a
level of soluble ST2 in a biological sample from a subject. Also provided are kits that contain an

By the term "ventricular tachyaryrrthmia event" or "VTA" is meant a medical condition that is
characterized by an abnormal, increased heart rate.          In some embodiments, the abnormal,
increased heart rate originates in one of the ventricles of the heart. Non-limiting examples of
VTA events include ventricular tachycardia (e.g., life-threatening ventricular tachycardia),
ventricular fibrillation (e.g., life-threatening ventricular fibrillation), and ventricular flutter (e.g.,
life-threatening ventricular flutter).
               By the term "implanted cardiac device" or "cardiac device" is meant a medical device
used to treat subjects who have arrhythmia, e.g., who are at risk of sudden cardiac death.
Implanted cardiac devices include cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices, implantable
cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) devices, and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator
(CRT-D) devices.
By the term "implanted cardiac defibrillator device" or "ICD device" is meant a small electrical
impulse generating medical device that is implanted in subjects determined to be at risk of having
a future VTA event. An ICD is programmed to detect the onset of a VTA event and stabilize or
reset the heart rate of the subject, e.g., by anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) or by delivering an

is a level of soluble ST2 in a control subject that does not have a cardiovascular disorder (e.g.,
arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or heart failure). In
some embodiments, a reference level is a level of soluble ST2 in a healthy subject. Additional
examples of reference levels of soluble ST2 are known in the art and are described herein.
               In some embodiments, a ratio of two soluble ST2 levels in a subject is determined and
compared to a reference ratio (e.g., a ratio of soluble ST2 levels measured in a control subject

Additional examples of reference ratios of soluble ST2 are known in the art and are described
herein.
               As used herein, a "subject" is a mammal, e.g., a human. In all embodiments, human
nucleic acids, human polypeptides, and human subjects can be used.
               By the term "healthy subject" is meant a subject that has not had a VTA event or is not at
risk of having a VTA event (e.g., any of the VTA events described herein). For example, a
healthy subject has not had a VTA event, is not at risk of having a VTA event, and has not
experienced two or more (e.g., two, three, four, or five) symptoms of a VTA event. In some
embodiments, a healthy subject has not had a VTA event, is not at risk of having a VTA event,
and does not present with two or more symptoms of a disease state.
               By the term "disease state" is meant the manifestation of one or more (e.g., at least two,
three, four, or five) symptoms in a subject that indicate either an abnormal decrease in the
viability and/or an abnormal decrease/malfunction of a biological activity of one or more (e.g., at
least two, three, four, or five) tissues in the body of the subject. Non-limiting examples of
disease states in a subject include a cardiac disease (e.g., arrhythmia, heart failure, heart attack,
coronary artery disease, cardiovascular disease, acute coronary syndrome, and angina),
inflammation, stroke, renal failure, obesity, high cholesterol, and dyslipidemia.

more (e.g., at least two, three, or four) symptoms that are manifested by a subject having a
particular disease state. Physical symptoms associated with several disease states are known in
the art by medical health professionals (e.g., physicians). Non-limiting examples of physical
symptoms associated with a cardiac disease (e.g., arrhythmia, heart failure, coronary artery
disease, cardiovascular disease, acute coronary syndrome, and angina) include shortness of

               As described herein, subjects having an elevated level of soluble ST2 or an increase in
soluble ST2 over time have an increased risk of having a ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VTA)
event. Thus, provided herein are methods for selecting a treatment for or treating a subject that
include determining a level of soluble ST2 in a biological sample from a subject, comparing the
level of soluble ST2 in the biological sample to a reference level of soluble ST2, and selecting,
implanting, replacing, or reprogramming an implanted cardiac device, e.g., an ICD, CRT, or
CRT-D device, for a subject having an elevated level of soluble ST2 in the biological sample
compared to the reference level of soluble ST2. Also provided are methods for selecting a
subject for participation in, or stratifying subjects in, a clinical study of a treatment for reducing
the risk of a VTA event, and methods of evaluating the risk of a VTA event in a subject that
include determining a level of soluble ST2 in a biological sample from a subject. Also provided
are kits that contain at least one antibody that specifically binds to soluble ST2 for use in the
methods described herein, and optionally instructions for performing any of the methods
described herein.
ST2
               The ST2 gene, also known as interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 (ILIRLI) is a member of the
interleukin- 1 receptor family, whose protein product exists both as a trans-membrane form, as
well as a soluble receptor that is detectable in serum (Kieser et al., FEBSLett. 372(2-3):189-93
(1995); Kumar et al., J Biol. Chem. 270(46):27905-13 (1995); Yanagisawa et al., FEBS Lett.
302(1):51-3 (1992); Kuroiwa et al., Hybridoma 19(2):151-9 (2000)). ST2 was recently described
to be markedly up-regulated in an experimental model of heart failure (Weinberg et al.,
Circulation 106(23):2961-6 (2002)), and preliminary results suggest that ST2 concentrations may
be elevated in those with chronic severe heart failure (Weinberg et al., Circulation 107(5):721-6
(2003)), as well in subjects with acute myocardial infarction (MI) (Shimpo et al., Circulation
109(18):2186-90 (2004)).
               The transmembrane form of ST2 is thought to play a role in modulating responses of T
helper type 2 cells (Lohning et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 95(12):6930-6935 (1998);
Schmitz et al., Immunity 23(5):479-90 (2005)), and may play a role in development of tolerance
                                                                14

                                                       - 15
in states of severe or chronic inflammation (Brint et al., Nat.Immunol. 5(4):373-9 (2004)), while
the soluble form of ST2 is up-regulated in growth stimulated fibroblasts (Yanagisawa et al.,
1992, supra). Experimental data suggest that the ST2 gene is markedly up-regulated in states of
myocyte stretch (Weinberg et al., 2002, supra) in a manner analogous to the induction of the
BNP gene (Bruneau et al., Cardiovasc.Res. 28(10):1519-25 (1994)).
               Tominaga, FEBS Lett. 258:301-304 (1989), isolated murine genes that were specifically
expressed by growth stimulation in BALB/c-3T3 cells; they termed one of these genes St2 (for
Growth Stimulation-Expressed Gene 2). The St2 gene encodes two protein products:                ST2
(ILIRLI), which is a soluble secreted form; and ST2L, a transmembrane receptor form that is
very similar to the interleukin- 1 receptors. The HUGO Nomenclature Committee designated the
human homolog of ST2, the cloning of which was described in Tominaga et al., Biochim.
Biophys. Acta. 1171:215-218 (1992), as Interleukin 1 Receptor-Like 1 (ILIRL1). The two terms
are used interchangeably herein.
               The mRNA sequence of the shorter, soluble isoform of human ST2 can be found at
GenBank Acc. No. NM_003856.2, and the polypeptide sequence is at GenBank Acc. No.
NP_003847.2 (SEQ ID NO: 1; shown below). The mRNA sequence for the longer form of
human ST2 is at GenBank Acc. No. NM_016232.4; and the polypeptide sequence is at GenBank
Acc. No. NP_057316.3. Additional information is available in the public databases at GeneID:
9173, MIM ID # 601203, and UniGene No. Hs.66. In general, in the methods described herein,
the soluble form of ST2 polypeptide is measured. Non-limiting examples of soluble ST2 protein
include proteins containing a sequence at least 90% identical (e.g., at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%,
99%, or 100% identical) to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. Non-limiting examples of soluble
ST2 nucleic acids include nucleic acids containing a sequence at least 90% identical (e.g., at least
95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical) to the sequence of NCBI Accession No.

               Methods for detecting and measuring soluble ST2 are known in the art, e.g., as described
in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2003/0124624, 2004/0048286, and 2005/0130136,
the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments,
the methods include determining the identity of the nucleotide sequence at RefSNP ID:
rs1041973.
               Kits for measuring soluble ST2 polypeptide are also commercially available, e.g., the ST2
ELISA Kit manufactured by Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd. (MBL International
Corp., Wobum, MA), No. 7638, and the Presage* ST2 Assay, Critical Care Diagnostics, San
Diego, CA. In addition, devices for measuring soluble ST2 and other biomarkers are described
in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0250156.                   Levels of soluble ST2 protein can also be
measured using the antibodies produced from the hybridoma deposited at American Type Culture
Collection and designated by Patent Deposit Designation PTA-10432, and those antibodies
described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2011/0256635 and WO 2011/127412 (each
of which is herein incorporated by reference).
               In some embodiments, the level of soluble ST2 is determined more than once; in some
embodiments, the higher measurement can be used. In embodiments where the level of soluble
ST2 is determined more than once, the highest level can be used, or the change in levels (e.g., a
ratio of two levels of ST2) can be determined and used.
               Levels of soluble ST2 can also be determined multiple times to evaluate a subject' s
response to a treatment for reducing the risk of a VTA event (e.g., a CRT or ICD). For example,
a level of soluble ST2 taken after implantation of an ICD or CRT, can be compared to levels of
soluble ST2 before implantation of an ICD or CRT, e.g., a baseline level. The change in soluble
ST2 levels would indicate whether the implantation of an ICD or CRT was effective; e.g., a
                                                            16

reduction in soluble ST2 level over time would indicate that the implantation of an ICD or CRT
was effective. Other exemplary methods that include determining a level of soluble ST2 (e.g.,
one or more levels of soluble ST2) are described herein.
ST2 Reference Levels
               Once a level of soluble ST2 has been determined in a biological sample from a subject,
the level may be compared to a reference level (e.g., any of the reference levels described herein
or known in the art). In some embodiments, e.g., where the level of soluble ST2 is determined
using an ELISA, the reference level may represent a threshold level, above which the subject is
identified as having an increased risk of an VTA event (and optionally selected for implantation
with an implanted cardiac device, e.g., an ICD, CRT, or CRT-D device,, or selected for
participation in a clinical study of a treatment for preventing or reducing the risk of a VTA
event). The reference level chosen may depend on the methodology (e.g., the particular antibody
or ELISA kit) used to measure the levels of soluble ST2. Reference levels of soluble ST2 are
known in the art and may readily be determined by one skilled in the art.
               Non-limiting threshold levels of soluble ST2 may represent a level, e.g., a median,
quartile, tertile, or other cutoff level, of soluble ST2 in particular patient populations, e.g.,
subjects with a BMI of less than 25, subjects with normal renal function, subjects without a
cardiac disease (e.g., any of the cardiac diseases described herein), and healthy (e.g.,
undiagnosed with disease, having a low risk of developing disease, and not presenting with two
or more symptoms of a disease) men, women, or children. For example, a threshold value for
soluble ST2 may fall within the range of about 1.0 to 10 ng/mL, 5.0 ng/mL to 10 ng/mL, about
10.0 ng/mL to 20.0 ng/mL, about 10.0 ng/mL to 15.0 ng/mL, about 15.0 ng/mL to 20.0 ng/mL,
about 20.0 ng/ml to 40 ng/mL, about 20 ng/mL to 30 ng/mL, about 20 ng/mL to 25 ng/mL, about
25 ng/mL to 30 ng/mL, about 30 ng/mL to about 40 ng/mL, about 30 ng/mL to 35 ng/mL, about
35 ng/mL to 40 ng/mL, about 40 ng/mL to about 60 ng/mL, about 40 ng/mL to about 50 ng/mL,
and about 50 ng/mL to about 60 ng/mL. Additional threshold values for soluble ST2 may fall
within the range of about 10 pg/mL to about 50 pg/mL, about 15 pg/mL to about 45 pg/mL,
about 15 pg/mL to about 40 pg/mL, about 20 pg/mL to about 45 pg/mL, about 25 pg/mL to about
45 pg/mL, about 30 pg/mL to about 40 pg/mL, or about 35 pg/mL.

               In some embodiments, the reference level of soluble ST2 is a level of soluble ST2 present
in a healthy subject (e.g., a subject that does not have a disease (e.g., cardiovascular disease), has
not been diagnosed as having a disease, and/or is not presenting with two or more (e.g., two,
three, four, or five) symptoms of a disease state). In some embodiments, a reference level of
soluble ST2 is a level of soluble ST2 from the same subject at an earlier point in time. In some
embodiments, the reference level of soluble ST2 is a level of soluble ST2 from a subject that
does not have a cardiac disease, has not been diagnosed as having a cardiac disease, and/or does

embodiments, the reference level of soluble ST2 is a level of soluble ST2 from a subject that has
not been diagnosed as having a cardiac disease and is not at risk for developing a cardiac disease
(e.g., arrhythmia, heart failure, heart attack, coronary artery disease, cardiovascular disease, acute
coronary syndrome, and angina). In some embodiments, the control subject has not been
diagnosed as having a cardiac disease, is not at risk of developing a cardiac disease, has a body
mass index of less than 25, and has a cholesterol (total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein,
and/or low density lipoprotein), and triglyceride profile within a normal range.
               In some embodiments, the ratio of two soluble ST2 levels in a subject is compared to a
reference ratio of soluble ST2 levels. In some embodiments, the reference ratio of soluble ST2
levels can be a threshold ratio (e.g., a reference ratio of soluble ST2 of 1.00, 1.01, 1.02, 1.03,
1.04, 1.05, 1.06, 1.07, 1.071, 1.08, 1.09, or 1.10). In some embodiments, the reference ratio of
soluble ST2 is a ratio of two levels of soluble ST2 measured in a control subject (e.g., any of the
control subjects described herein or the same subject). For example, a reference ratio can be a
ratio of the levels of soluble ST2 collected at two different time points in a healthy subject (e.g., a
subject that does not have a disease (e.g., any of the cardiac diseases described herein), has not
been diagnosed as having a disease, and/or is not presenting with two or more (e.g., two, three,
four, or five) symptoms of a disease state). In some embodiments, a reference ratio of soluble
ST2 is a ratio of soluble ST2 levels from the same subject at an earlier point in time. In some
embodiments, the reference ratio of soluble ST2 is a ratio of soluble ST2 levels from a subject
that does not have a cardiac disease, has not been diagnosed as having a cardiac disease, and/or

Additional Markers
               Some embodiments of all of the methods described herein, may further include
determining the level of one or more (e.g., at least two, three, four, or four) additional markers in
a biological sample from the subject, to provide further information regarding risk of a VTA (see,
e.g., Scott et al., Europace. 13(10):1419-27 (2011) and references cited therein). The additional
markers may be selected from the group of: proANP, NT-proANP, ANP, proBNP, NT-proBNP,
BNP, troponin, CRP, creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), galectin, liver function enzymes,
albumin, endothelin-1, and bacterial endotoxin. The one or more additional markers can be
measured in any of the biological samples herein. The presence of an elevated level (e.g., at least
10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%,                5 5 %, 60%, 65%,  7 0%, 7 5 %, 80%, 85%,

220%, 230%, 240%, 250%, 260%, 270%, 280%, 290%, or 300%) of one or more (e.g., at least
two, three, or four) of proANP, NT-proANP, ANP, proBNP, NT-proBNP, BNP, troponin, CRP,
creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), galectin, liver function enzymes, albumin, endothelin- 1,
and bacterial endotoxin in a subject compared to a reference level for each of these additional
biomarkers may further indicate that the subject has an increased risk of VTA, the subject should
receive continued treatment (e.g., treatment on an inpatient basis), the subject should receive an
ICD or CRT, the subject should be selected for implantation of an ICD or CRT, or the subject
should be selected for participation in a clinical study of a treatment to decrease the risk of a VTA
event.
               In some embodiments, the level of one or more additional biomarkers is determined more
than once; in some embodiments, the higher measurement can be used of an additional biomarker
can be used. In embodiments where the level of an additional biomarker is determined more than
once, the highest level can be used, or the change in levels (e.g., a ratio of two levels of an
additional biomarker) can be determined and used.
               Levels of an additional biomarker can also be determined multiple times to evaluate a
subject' s response to a treatment (e.g., acardiac device). For example, a level of one or more
                                                        21

additional biomarkers taken after implantation of a cardiac device, can be compared to levels of
the one or more additional biomarkers before implantation of a cardiac device, e.g., a baseline
level. The change in the level of one or more additional biomarkers would indicate or further
indicate whether the implantation of a cardiac device was effective; e.g., a reduction in the level
of one or more additional biomarkers would indicate or further indicate that the implantation of a
cardiac device was effective. Other exemplary methods that include determining a level of one
or more additional biomarkers (e.g., one or more levels of BNP, proBNP, and NT-proBNP) are
described herein.
               Once a level of an additional biomarker has been determined in a biological sample from
a subject, the level may be compared to a reference level of the additional biomarker (e.g., any of
the reference levels described herein or known in the art). In some embodiments, e.g., where the
level of an additional biomarker is determined using an ELISA, the reference level may represent
a threshold level, above which the subject is identified as having an increased risk of a disease
associated with the biomarker, e.g., cardiovascular disease, and/or a VTA event. Such subjects
can, for example, optionally selected for implantation, reprogramming, or replacement of a
cardiac device, treated with implantation, reprogramming, or replacement of a cardiac device, or
selected for participation in or stratified within a clinical study of a treatment for preventing a
VTA event. The reference level of the additional biomarker chosen may depend on the
methodology (e.g., the particular antibody or ELISA kit) used to measure the levels of the
additional biomarker. Reference levels of additional biomarkers are known in the art and may
readily be determined by one skilled in the art.
               Non-limiting threshold levels of additional biomarkers may represent a threshold or
cutoff level, e.g., a quartile, tertile, or median level of an additional biomarker in particular
patient populations, e.g., subjects with a BMI of less than 25, subjects with normal renal
function, subjects without cardiac disease (e.g., any of the cardiac diseases described herein),
healthy (e.g., undiagnosed with disease, having a low risk of developing disease, and not
presenting with two or more symptoms of a disease) men, women, and/or children.
               In some embodiments, the reference level of an additional biomarker is a level of an
additional biomarker present in a healthy subject (e.g., a subject that does not have a disease
(e.g., any of the cardiac diseases described herein), has not been diagnosed as having a disease or

three, four, or five) symptoms of a disease state or condition associated with the biomarker). In
some embodiments, a reference level of an additional biomarker is a level of the additional
biomarker from the same subject at an earlier point in time. In some embodiments, the reference
level of an additional biomarker is a level of the additional biomarker from a subject that does
not have a cardiac disease, has not been diagnosed as having a cardiac disease, and/or does not
have two or more symptoms associated with a cardiac disease (e.g., arrhythmia, heart failure,
heart attack, coronary artery disease, cardiovascular disease, acute coronary syndrome, and
angina), inflammation, stroke, renal failure, obesity, high cholesterol, or dyslipidemia. In some
embodiments, the reference level of an additional biomarker is a level of the additional
biomarker from a subject that has not been diagnosed as having a cardiac disease and is not at
risk for developing a cardiac disease (e.g., arrhythmia, heart failure, heart attack, coronary artery
disease, cardiovascular disease, acute coronary syndrome, and angina).
               In some embodiments, the ratio of two different levels of an additional biomarker in a
subject is determined and compared to a reference ratio of the additional biomarker. In some
embodiments, the reference ratio of an additional biomarker can be a threshold ratio (e.g., a
reference ratio of 1.00, 1.00, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, or 2.0). In some embodiments,
the reference ratio of an additional biomarker is a ratio of two levels of the additional biomarker
measured in a control subject (e.g., any of the control subjects described herein or the same
subject). For example, a reference ratio of an additional biomarker can be a ratio of the levels of
an additional biomarker collected at two different time points in a healthy subject (e.g., a subject
that does not have a disease (e.g., any of the cardiac diseases described herein), has not been

Methods for Selecting a Treatment for or Treating a Subject
               Provided herein are methods of selecting a treatment for or treating a subject that include
determining a level or ratio of soluble ST2 in a biological sample from a subject, comparing the
level or ratio of soluble ST2 in the biological sample to a reference level or ratio of soluble ST2
(e.g., any of the reference levels of soluble ST2 described herein), and selecting, implanting,
replacing, and/or reprogramming an implanted cardiac device, e.g., an ICD or CRT device, or a
combination CRT and ICD (i.e. CRT-D) device, e.g., a cardiac device manufactured by Boston
Scientific, Natick, MA), for a subject having an elevated level of soluble ST2 in the biological
sample compared to the reference level of soluble ST2. Also provided are methods of selecting a
treatment for or treating a subject that include determining a level of soluble ST2 in a first
biological sample from a subject at a first time point, determining a level of soluble ST2 in a
second biological sample obtained from the subject at a second time point, comparing the level
of soluble ST2 in the first biological sample to the level of soluble ST2 in the second biological
sample, and selecting, implanting, replacing, and/or reprogramming an implanted a cardiac
device, e.g., an ICD device, CRT device, or CRT-D device, for a subject having an elevated level
of soluble ST2 in the second biological sample compared to the level of soluble ST2 in the
second biological sample. In some embodiments, the first and second time points are within two
years (e.g., within 18 months, within 12 months, within 10 months, within 8 months, within 6
months, within 4 months, within 2 months, within 1 month, or within 1 week of each other).
In some embodiments, as an alternative or in addition to selecting a device, e.g., an ICD or CRT
device, or a combination CRT and ICD (i.e. CRT-D) device, the method includes selecting and/or
implementing a treatment that includes altering programming of a device already implanted in a
subject based on ST2 levels or changes in ST2 concentrations. The programming of the device
can be changed to alter the sensitivity and/or specificity of the detection algorithm. When ST2

levels are low and not changing over time, or dropping over time, there is a low probability of a
true VTA occurring, and detection should be more specific and less sensitive, e.g., by a few
percentage points. In contrast, in a subject with high levels of ST2 compared to the reference or
when ST2 levels are increased, there is a high probability of true VTA occurring then you
increase the sensitivity and lower the specificity. The programming parameters that embody this
are:
              1. Rate - Lower VTA detection rates are more sensitive, higher rates more specific.
              2. Rhythm ID - Could be made variable.
              3. Duration - Longer detection durations when true VTA is unlikely.
              4. Therapy -Anti tachycardia Pacing (ATP) preferentially used before shocks when true
              VTA is unlikely.
               In subjects who have received inappropriate shocks (i.e., when the device is too sensitive
and is delivering a therapeutic shock when no arrhythmia is present), ST2 levels can be used to
determine whether the programming should be altered. For example, in a subject who presently
has a device, if the levels of ST2 in the subject are below a reference level and/or stable or
dropping, then the device can be reprogrammed with lower sensitivity. If the levels of ST2 in the
subject are elevated above a reference level and/or are increasing (i.e., the subject has a high or
increasing risk of VTA) then the device should not be reprogrammed with lower sensitivity; the
subject may just need to accept some inappropriate shocks. In some embodiments, the device is
reprogrammed accordingly.
               ST2 levels can also be used to determine whether a subject should have an implanted
device replaced, e.g., at the end of the battery life. For example, in a subject who presently has a
device, but has never had a therapy (e.g., never needed a shock from the device), ST2 levels can
be used to determine whether the device should be replaced; if the levels of ST2 in the subject
are below a reference level and/or stable or dropping, then the device need not be replaced. If the
levels of ST2 in the subject are elevated above a reference level and/or are increasing (i.e., the
subject has a high or increasing risk ofVTA) then the device should be replaced. These methods
can further include replacing the device.
               In addition, the methods described above can include selecting a subject for a therapy,
e.g., prioritizing subjects for treatment when factors such as time, cost, resources or device

availability make it necessary to prioritize subjects. Based on levels of ST2 or changes in ST2
levels, subjects can be prioritized according to risk of a VTA; higher levels of ST2, and/or
increasing levels of ST2 over time, are correlated with increased risk of VTA; these subjects
should be prioritized over those with levels of ST2 that are lower and/or are stable or dropping.
               Furthermore, the methods can include selecting a specific device for a subject, e.g., levels
could be used to determine whether a subject should get a device that is a CRT (i.e. CRT-P) alone
(e.g., a subject who has lower ST2 levels and thus a lower risk of VTA - though still an elevated
risk) or CRT plus and ICD (i.e. CRT-D) (e.g., a subject who has higher ST2 levels and thus a
higher risk of VTA). The methods can include comparing the ST2 levels in the subject to a
reference as described above, e.g., a reference level or range of levels determines using methods
known in the art, and the device selected based on the presence of a level of ST2 in the subject
that falls above a certain threshold, or within a range of levels, or above the range.                      Some
embodiments further include implanting the selected device (e.g., a CRT or a CRT plus an ICD)
into the subject.
               In some embodiments, the subject has been diagnosed as having a cardiac disease (e.g.,
arrhythmia, heart failure, heart attack, coronary artery disease, cardiovascular disease, acute
coronary syndrome, and angina). In some embodiments, the subject has been identified as
having an increased risk of developing a cardiac disease (e.g., arrhythmia, heart failure, heart
attack, coronary artery disease, cardiovascular disease, acute coronary syndrome, and angina).
In some embodiments, the subject has heart failure (e.g., chronic heart failure).                        In some
embodiments, the subject has had at least one VTA event. In some embodiments, the subject
may be female or male, and may be an adult orjuvenile (e.g., an infant). Where the subject is an
adult, the subject may be, e.g., between 18 to 20 years old or at least or about 20, 25, 30, 35, 40,

ICD device, CRT device, or CRT-D device, for a subject determined to have an elevated level of

combination thereof.
               In some embodiments, the biological sample, the first biological sample, and/or the
second biological sample are or contain blood, serum, or plasma. In some embodiments, the
biological sample, the first biological sample, and/or the second biological sample are stored
(e.g., at a temperature below 25'C, e.g., at a temperature below 15 'C or 0 'C) for a period of
time (e.g., at least 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, or 48 hours) prior to determining the level of soluble
ST2 and/or determining the level of one or more additional biomarkers (e.g., BNP).
               In some embodiments, the level of soluble ST2 is determined using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (e.g., using any of the soluble ST2 ELISAkits described herein or

determined using an antibody described in WO 2011/127412, which is incorporated by reference
herein.
               In some embodiments, two or more levels of soluble ST2 are measured in biological

second biological sample compared to a reference level of the one or more additional biomarkers.
In some embodiments, the level of one or more additional biomarkers is determined in both the
first biological sample and the second biological sample, a ratio of the level of the one or more
additional biomarkers present in the second biological sample compared to the level of the one or

samples (e.g., a first and second biological sample) from the subject. In these examples, a
subject having an elevated level of soluble ST2 in a sample collected at a later time point (e.g., a
second time point) compared to a level of soluble ST2 collected at an earlier time point (e.g., a
first time point) is selected for participation in a clinical study of a treatment for reducing the risk
of a VTA event, or stratified based on the change in ST2 levels. In some embodiments where
two levels of soluble ST2 are determined in a subject, a ratio of the levels of soluble ST2 in the
subject is determined (the ratio of the level of soluble ST2 at the second time point compared to
the level of soluble ST2 at the first time), the calculated soluble ST2 ratio is then compared to a
reference ratio of soluble ST2 (e.g., any of the reference ratios of soluble ST2 described herein),
and a subject having an elevation in the calculated soluble ST2 ratio compared to the reference
ratio of soluble ST2 is selected for participation in a clinical study of a treatment for reducing the
risk of a VTA event. In some embodiments, a subject having no significant difference or a
decrease in the calculated soluble ST2 ratio compared to the reference ratio of soluble ST2 is not
selected or excluded from participation in a clinical study for a treatment for reducing the risk of
a VTA event.
               Some embodiments further include detecting a level of one or more additional biomarkers
(e.g., any of the additional biomarkers described herein, e.g., BNP, proBNP, and NT-proBNP) in
a biological sample from the subject (e.g., the biological sample, the first biological sample,
and/or the second biological sample). In these embodiments, a subject having an elevation in the
level of the one or more additional biomarkers in the biological sample, the first biological
sample, and/or the second biological sample as compared to a reference level of the one or more
additional biomarkers is selected for participation in a clinical study of a treatment for reducing
the risk of a VTA event. In some embodiments, a subject having no significant change or a
decreased level of the one or more additional biomarkers compared to a reference level of the
one or more additional biomarkers is not selected or is excluded from participation in a clinical
study of a treatment for reducing the risk of a VTA event. In some embodiments, the level of one
or more additional biomarkers is determined in both the first biological sample and the second
                                                         34

                                                      EXAMPLES
Example 1. Soluble ST2 can be used to assess the risk of a VTA in subjects with stable
heart failure
        A set of experiments was performed to determine if soluble ST2 (ST2) is useful for predicting
the occurrence of VTA events in stable class I/II heart failure patients who were receiving
treatment with an ICD or CRT-D (subjects enrolled in the MADIT-CRT trial). A schematic of
the MADIT-CRT study design is shown in Figure 1. The MADIT-CRT is the largest randomized
NYHA Class I/II ICD/CRT-D trial to date. A total of 1820 patients were enrolled in this study at
110 centers in 14 countries. The average follow-up time for subjects participating in this study
was 34.3 months. Commercially available devices were used in these studies (Boston Scientific,
Natick, MA).
        In these experiments, soluble ST2 and BNP levels were measured at baseline and at 1 year in
patients participating in this MADIT-CRT (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation
Trial-Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) sub-study (N= 684 and 1197, respectively).               An
appropriate anti-arrhythmic therapy for VTA (including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular
fibrillation, and ventricular flutter) was decided by a core lab. Survival models were used to
assess the prognostic value of baseline ST2 and change in ST2 from baseline to 12 months of
time to VTA. Levels of BNP were determined using a commercially available ELISA assay
(BAYER). The levels of soluble ST2 were determined using a commercially available ELISA
(Presage* ST2 Assay, Critical Care Diagnostics, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer' s
instructions.
        The primary outcome to be assessed in these studies was the time to the first occurrence of
appropriate anti-arrhythmic therapy for a VTA event.           A VTA event includes ventricular
tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and/or ventricular flutter (VFL). For the purposes
of these experiments, a VT was defined as the ventricular rate up to 250 beats/minute, a VF was
defined as a ventricular rate faster than 250 beast/minute with disorganized ventricular
electrograms, a VFL was defined as a ventricular rate faster than 250 beats/minute and
monomorphic, and an anti-arrhythmic therapy was defined as any type of therapy that was
rendered including anti-tachycardia pacing and cardiac shock.
                                                           37

                                                       - 38
        The data show that baseline ST2 levels were significantly higher in male, NYHA class I, right
bundle branch block, ischemic, prior CABG, and prior MI subgroups (see, Figure 2, all
P<0.001). Higher baseline levels were also associated with amiodarone (p = 0.024) and statin (p
=    0.020) use, and the lack of aldosterone use at baseline (p  = 0.020) (Figure 2).
        Trends for increased risk of VTA were found with log-transformed (ln) ST2 and InBNP at
baseline (HR 1.6 [95% CI 0.99-2.6], P=0.056 and HR 1.11 [95% CI 1-1.23], P=0.051
respectively). The baseline soluble ST2 levels were also prognostic of device therapy for VTA
(ln(ST2): HR = 1.6 (0.99-2.6); p = 0.058).
        A small increase in ST2 levels from baseline to 12 months (0.06 ng/mL (IQR: -3.9-6.0
ng/mL) was blunted by CRT treatment (ICD: median 1.04 fold increase; IQR =0.89-1.32; CRT
D: median fold increase 1.02; IQR= 0.86-1.19; Kruskal-Wallis test p=0.0365).
        Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the difference of ln ST2 levels from baseline to 12
months was independently predictive for VTA(HR 3.71 [95% ClI 1.4-9.8]; p=0.008). The change
in soluble ST2 levels was prognostic of VTA after 1 year (ln(AST2): HR = 3.8 (1.45-9.99); p =
0.008). In the 42% of the patients with an ST2 increase of more than 7 .1%, the risk of VTA
increased by 2.25-fold (95% CI 1.2-4.1; p=0.008) (Figures 3 and 4). The change in ST2
remained predictive even after controlling for changes in BNP, LVEF, LVESV, and LVEDV
(P=0.0048).
        The baseline soluble ST2 levels were also prognostic of all-cause mortality or heart failure
events in these subjects (ln(ST2): HR = 2.19 (1.45-3.33); p < 0.001) (tertiles of ST2; p = 0.01)
(ST2 divided at its traditional cut point of 35 ng/mL: HR       =  2.2 (1.58-3.08); p < 0.001). The
prognostic value of all-cause mortality holds after controlling for baseline risk factors. Baseline
soluble ST2 divided at its traditional cut point (35 pg/mL) and BNP divided at the median value
(72 pg/mL) was also prognostic of all-cause mortality or heart failure events (Figure 5; p <
0.001).
        In sum, the data show that serial measurement of ST2 may be a valuable tool for monitoring
stable patients with mild HF for risk of future arrhythmias, and that levels of soluble ST2 can be
used to identify subjects that would benefit from CRT or an ICD, identify a subjects at risk of
having a VTA, and to select a therapy for a subject (e.g., determine whether a subject should
receive CRT or be implanted with an ICD).
