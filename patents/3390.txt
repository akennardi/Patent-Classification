       Appendix A, Set up and operating instructions
       To set the unit up.
        First ensure the wrapper is working as it should, cutting and clamping with the film
       separating completely from the clamp without too much tension.
        Ideal setup is to have the film just cut through consistently and the "tail" ending as
        below picture. This can normally be adjusted by increasing/decreasing Preset 6 under
        presets (Time to turn off motor at end of cycle).
       Once the wrapper is set up move the arm close to its final position - center of the
       table beside the Module and roughly 500mm from the base, remove the turntable
       top from the wrapper and route cable supplied into electrical cabinet of wrapper
       extra holes may be required in the skirt of the wrapper and the bottom of the cabinet
       to achieve this.
        Mount the controller inside the control box and wire up as per electrical drawings.
        locate the programmable keypad. Make sure you are comfortable with the various
        buttons on the controller before proceeding Once you are ready push the open button
       and the arm should swing out - wait for the arm to reach the end of its stroke and
       turn off power - it is now ready for the arm to be bolted to the floor.
        Line the head up square to the XT module as shown on the picture below and drill one
        bolt into the concrete at this point. Once this is done you can test the full operation of
       the arm.
       Once this has been done drill the other 3 bolts on the sealer and mount the bollard 100
mm in front of the sealing head in its home position .Route the cable (signal wire)across the
gap between the sealer and wrapper, drill a new hole in the skirt, fit grommet and route the
cable along the same cable as the actuator into the machine control cabinet. Connect the two
wires to DC+ and #3 on the terminal strip.
       Arm is now ready for final setup.
        Main controls needing adjustment on the sealer.
            e   Current trip -This is how much force can be applied to the arm to stop its
                movement - normally set around .8 amp, if it is too low the arm will stop
                prematurely.

* Motor Settings #1- Open speed , this needs to be set so the arm (Motor#1)
  reaches the pallet just after the pallet reaches the home position.
  Whilst testing this adjustment ensure you are ready to reset the arm (button
  on side of box) if a collision looks possible.

                         Retractable Film Tail wiping unit
* Description
  The method & apparatus for wiping the film tail on to a pallet of product, on a
  Stretchwrapper, to obtain a smooth seal between the end of the film and the film on
  the pallet, where the apparatus retracts out of the way to avoid collisions by fork lift
  when pallets are being loaded onto wrapper. And is designed to eliminate the need
  for exclusion fenscing and/or light guards.(see pdf:- technical drawing, and photos
  included with these)
  The unit is manufactured using RHS steel for the frame and arm, with a base plate &
  an electric linear actuator to extend and retract the arm. The part of the unit that
  wipes the film onto the pallet is a series of UHMWPE sheets looped back on
  themselves to form flexible flaps.
  The unit is wired into electrical cabinet as per the set up instructions (Appendix A &
  technical drawings).
  The linear actuator is on a current limiter which will cause the arm to retract if it
  meets an obstruction before fully extending. The arm returns when the photo eye on
  the roll carriage gives it a signal that the pallet has been removed, or when the
  wrapper is restarted.
  The unit is protected by a bollard installed in front of it, (as per technical drawings)
* Reason
  Customer complaints on machines where the film tail tends to unwrap from the pallet
  causing warehousing and appearance problems, and rejected pallets of product at
  large distribution centres (See photo of tail end)
* Operation
  At the end of a wrap cycle when the cut and clamp module cuts the film an arm will
  swing in from beside the machine capturing the film tail against the pallet (see jpeg:
  wiper pads against pallet as fork removes), when the pallet is removed from the
  turntable by the forklift operator the wiper flaps will wipe the film tail onto the pallet
  creating a smooth seal (see jpeg wiping film back onto pallet)
  Once the pallet is clear of the turntable the arm will move back into its home position.
  The unit runs by a simple PLC with the signal to start coming from the wrapper.

  Operation of the swinging arm is through 24VDC linear motors.
  The unit will be enabled through a 24VDC contactor
* Other factors
  There is a timer to determine the arm has stopped in the pallet home position. There
  is a current trip function that will send the arm home if it hits something other than
  the pallet (A person or foreign object ). If the arm has not reached the wipe point
  within the set cycle time then the arm shall return to its home position and wait until
  another start signal is given.
  Start signal will be through a 24V signal from the Actuator on stretchwrapper.

 Editorial Note
   <removed-apn>
There is one page of claims only

The Claim:
The retractable film tail wiping unit is an improvement on known wiping arms on automated
pallet wrapper systems because, it does not need compressed air for its operation, it is safer
(does not require fencing and light guards due to its low power and ability to retract if it
encounters an obstacle, and can be located at a distance from the wrapper instead directly
adjacent, so removing pinch points) and there is the economic advantage of this unit being
an after market add on to a low cost wrapper instead of needing a fully automated, enclosed
system.
