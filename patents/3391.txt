Invention Title:     SUBCUTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION OF

The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method of
performing it known to me:
                                               1

                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0001] The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as an
acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that such art forms part of the common general
knowledge.
[0002] The ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type I
motifs) proteins are a family of metalloproteinases containing number of conserved domains,
including a zinc-dependant catalytic domain, a cystein-rich domain, a disintegrin-like
domain, and at least one, and in most cases multiple, thrombospondin type I repeats (for
review, see Nicholson et al., BMC Evol Biol. 2005 Feb. 4 ;5(1):1 1). These proteins, which
are evolutionarily related to the ADAM and MMP families of metalloproteinases (Jones G C,
Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2006 February ;7(1):25-3 1), are secreted enzymes that have been
linked to a number of diseases and conditions including thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura (TTP) (Moake J L, Semin Hematol. 2004 January ;41(1):4-14), connective tissue
disorders, cancers, inflammation (Nicholson et al.), and severe plasmodium falciparum
malaria (Larkin et al., PLoS Pathog. 2009 March ;5(3):e1000349). Because of these
associations, the ADAMTS enzymes have been recognized as potential therapeutic targets for
a number of pathologies (Jones G C, Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2006 February;7(1):25-3 1).
[0003] One ADAMTS family member, ADAMTS13, cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF)
between residues Tyr 1605 and Met 1606. Loss of ADAMTS13 activity has been linked to a
number of conditions, such as TTP (Moake J L, Semin Hematol. 2004 January ;41(1):4-14),
acute and chronic inflammation (Chauhan et al., J Exp Med. 2008 Sep. 1 ;205(9):2065-74),
and most recently, severe plasmodium falciparum malaria (Larkin et al., PLoS Pathog. 2009
March;5(3):e1000349).
[0004] Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a disorder characterized by
thrombotic microangiopathy, thrombocytopenia and microvascular thrombosis that can cause
various degrees of tissue ischemia and infarction. Clinically, TTP patients are diagnosed by
symptoms such as thrombocytopenia, schistocytes (fragments of erythrocytes) and elevated
levels of lactate dehydrogenase (Moake J L. Thrombotic microangiopathies. N Engl J Med.
2002 ; 347:589-600; Moake J L. von Willebrand factor, ADAMTS-13, and thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura. Semin Hematol. 2004 ; 41:4-14; Sadler J E, Moake J L, Miyata T,

Hematol Educ Program). 2004 : 407-423; Sadler J E. New concepts in von Willebrand
disease. Annu Rev Med. 2005; 56:173-191).
[0005] There are two major types of TTP: acquired (noninherited/idopathic) and familial
(inherited) (Tsai H M, Lian E C. Antibodies to von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease in
acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. N Engl J. Med. 1998; 339:1585-1594; Furlan
M, Lammle B. Deficiency of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease in familial and
acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1998; 11:509
514). Genetic mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene cause the familial form of TTP whereas
people with acquired TTP do not have the mutations. Rather, acquired TTP is characterized
by the production of specific antibodies.
[0006] In 1982, Moake et al. found unusually large von Willebrand factor (UL-vWF)
multimers in the plasma of the patients with chronic relapsing TTP (Moake J L, Rudy C K,
Troll J H, Weinstein M J, Colannino N M, Azocar J, Seder R H, Hong S L, Deykin D.
Unusually large plasma factor VIII:von Willebrand factor multimers in chronic relapsing
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. N Engl J Med. 1982 ; 307:1432-1435). The link
between UL-vWF and TTP gained support with independent findings by Furlan et al. and
Tsai and Lian that most patients suffering from TTP are deficient in a plasma
metalloprotease, now known to be ADAMTS 13, that cleaves vWF (Furlan M, Robles R,

factor-cleaving protease in chronic relapsing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Blood.

[0007] The ADAMTS 13 protease is a 190 kDa glycosylated protein produced predominantly
by the liver (Levy G G, Nichols W C, Lian E C, Foroud T, McClintick J N, McGee B M,

[0008] Mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene have been shown to cause TTP (Levy G G,
Nichols W C, Lian E C, Foroud T, McClintick J N, McGee B M, Yang A Y, Siemieniak D R,

ADAMTS gene family cause thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Nature. 2001 ; 413:488
494). Idiopathic TTP, often caused by autoantibodies inhibiting ADAMTS-13 activity, is a
more common disorder that occurs in adults and older children and can recur at regular
intervals in 11-36% of patients (Tsai H M, Lian E C. Antibodies to von Willebrand factor
cleaving protease in acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. N Engl J Med. 1998 ;
339:1585-1594; Furlan M, Lammle B. Deficiency of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease
in familial and acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Baillieres Clin Haematol.
1998 ; 11:509-514).
[0009] Non neutralizing autoantibodies could also inhibit ADAMTS activity by inducing
clearance from circulation (Scheiflinger F, Knobl P, Trattner B, Plaimauer B, Mohr G,
Dockal M, Dorner F, Rieger M. Nonneutralizing IgM and IgG antibodies to von Willebrand
factor-cleaving protease (ADAMTS-13) in a patient with thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura. Blood. 2003 ; 102:3241-3243). Plasma ADAMTS13 activity in healthy adults ranges
from 50% to 178% (Moake J L. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the hemolytic
uremic syndrome. Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2002 ; 126:1430-1433). In most patients with
familial or acquired TTP, plasma ADAMTS13 activity is absent or less than 5% of the
normal. Without treatment the mortality rate exceeds 90%, but plasma therapy has reduced
mortality to about 20% (Moake J L. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the
hemolytic uremic syndrome. Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2002 ; 126:1430-1433).

[00010]         vWF synthesized in megakaryocytes and endothelial cells is stored in platelet
-granules and Weibel-Palade bodies, respectively, as ultra large vWF (UL-vWF) (Moake J L,

985; Tsai H M, Nagel R L, Hatcher V B, Sussman, II. Multimeric composition of endothelial
cell-derived von Willebrand factor. Blood. 1989 ; 73:2074-2076). Once secreted from
endothelial cells, these UL-vWF multimers are cleaved by ADAMTS 13 in circulation into a
series of smaller multimers at specific cleavage sites within the vWF molecule (Tsai H M,
Nagel R L, Hatcher V B, Sussman, II. Endothelial cell-derived high molecular weight von
Willebrand factor is converted into the plasma multimer pattern by granulocyte proteases.

D, Baillod P, Lammle B. Triplet structure of von Willebrand factor reflects proteolytic
degradation of high molecular weight multimers. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1993 ; 90:7503
7507).
[00011]         ADAMTS13 cleaves at the Tyr842-Met843 bond in the central A2 domain of
the mature vWF subunit and requires zinc or calcium for activity (Dent J A, Berkowitz S D,
Ware J, Kasper C K, Ruggeri Z M. Identification of a cleavage site directing the
immunochemical detection of molecular abnormalities in type IIA von Willebrand factor.
Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1990 ; 87:6306-63 10). vWF exists in "ball-of-yarn" and
filamentous form as seen by electron microscopy (Slayter H, Loscalzo J, Bockenstedt P,
Handin R I. Native conformation of human von Willebrand protein. Analysis by electron
microscopy and quasi-elastic light scattering. J Biol. Chem. 1985 ; 260:8559-8563).
                                                5

Furthermore, atomic force microscopy confirms that vWF exits in a globular conformation
under static conditions and an unfolded filamentous state after exposure to shear stress
(Siedlecki C A, Lestini B J, Kottke-Marchant K K, Eppell S J, Wilson D L, Marchant R E.
Shear-dependent changes in the three-dimensional structure of human von Willebrand factor.
Blood. 1996 ; 88:2939-2950). This could occur also in vivo when one end of the vWF
filament is anchored to a surface.
[00012]         Thrombi of TTP patients consist of little fibrin and mainly of vWF and
platelets, suggesting vWF-mediated platelet aggregation as a cause of thrombosis (Asada Y,
Sumiyoshi A, Hayashi T, Suzumiya J, Kaketani K. Immunohistochemistry of vascular lesion
in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, with special reference to factor VIII related antigen.
Thromb Res. 1985 ; 38:469-479). Patients with relapsing TTP have ultra-large multimers in
the plasma. The UL-vWF multimers accumulate over time because the persistence of the
inhibitor (Anti-ADAMTS 13 Ab) decreases ADAMTS13 activity. The UL-vWF multimers
are hyperactive and unfold as a result of shear stress causing platelet aggregation, resulting in
intravascular thrombosis (Tsai H M. Von Willebrand factor, ADAMTS 13, and thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura. J Mol Med. 2002 ; 80:639-647; Tsai H M. Deficiency of
ADAMTS-13 in thrombotic and thrombocytopenic purpura. J Thromb Haemost. 2003;
1:2038-2040; discussion 2040-2035).
[00013]         It is believed that the presence of hyper-reactive UL-vWF multimers in the
plasma due to ADAMTS13 deficiency could be associated with an increased risk of arterial
thrombosis linked to coronary heart disease. Furthermore, ADAMTS 13 has been linked to
cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, ischemic/reperfusion injury, deep vein thrombosis,
and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Accordingly, there is a need for pharmaceutical
formulations of ADAMTS13 proteins suitable for the treatment of various diseases and
conditions associated with ADAMTS 13 and VWF dysfunction.
[00014]         However, pharmaceutical formulations comprising very large and labile
molecules such as ADAMTS13 can generally only be administered intravenously. This is
because such pharmaceutical formulations normally exhibit a very low bioavailablity due to
insufficient absorption and severe degradation when given subcutaneously, intramuscularly,
and intradermally. Accordingly, due to the low bio availability, large and labile proteins are
normally administered intravenously to provide direct availability to the blood stream.
                                                 6

[00015]          While ADAMTS13 can be administered intravenously to treat various
diseases and conditions associated with ADAMTS13 and VWF dysfunction, it is
inconvenient and not easy for patients to handle. Particularly, ADAMTS13 formulations are
often administered regularly throughout a patient's life. For example, patients with familial
(inherited) TTP begin treatment with intravenous ADAMTS 13 in their first year of life.
Accordingly, it would be advantageous to subcutaneously administer a pharmaceutical
composition of ADAMTS 13. However, low bioavailabilities of subcutaneously administered
large and labile protein formulations has prevented the development of such subcutaneous
formulations.
[000161          Previous studies have reported that certain coagulation factors VII, VIII, and
IX that are suitable for subcutaneous administration. For example, PCT/SE95/00348 reports
a Factor VIII formulation that is highly purified that contains additives such as hydrolyzed
gelatin, hyaluronic acid, and soybean oil emulsion. The purification and additives allowed
for the Factor VIII formulation to be highly concentrated. This highly concentrated
formulation resulted in a bioavailability of at least about 15% and suitably at least about 30%
after subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal administration compared to the
bioavailability after intravenous administration. However,    1 5 - 3 0 % bioavailability of
subcutaneous administration compared to intravenous administration is still very low and
would not be effective at treating ADAMTS 13 disorders.
[00017]          Furthermore, the prior studies do not provide a general principle for
subcutaneous administration of large and labile proteins. Rather, prior studies present
evidence of that it is subcuntaneous pharmaceutical compositions of large and labile proteins
are difficult to prepare because the compositions lack the requisite bioavailability for
subcutaneous administration.
[00018]          Described herein is a method of subcutaneously administering an ADAMTS13
formulation to a treat a disease or condition associated with ADAMTS 13 and VWF
dysfunction. Specifically, evidence of the unexpectedly high bioavailability, up to
approximately 70%, of ADAMTS13 formulations administered subcutaneously is provided
herein.

                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
    I.       INTRODUCTION
[00068]          ADAMTS 13 is a plasma metalloprotease which cleaves von Willebrand factor
(VWF) multimers and down regulates their activity in platelet aggregation. ADAMTS 13 is
associated clotting disorders such as inherited thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP),
acquired TTP, cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, ischemic/reperfusion injury, deep
vein thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) such as sepsis-related
DIC.
[00069]          Current treatment of these clotting disorders involve intravenous
administration of ADMTS13 formulations. Treatment is currently limited to intravenous
administration because ADAMTS 13 is a large protein and large proteins are generally not
stable in formulations with high bioavailabilities suitable for subcutaneous administration.
The mature ADAMTS13 has a calculated molecular mass of about 145 kDa whereas purified
plasma-derived ADAMTS13 has an apparent molecular mass of about 180 kDa probably due
to post-translational modifications consisting with present consensus sequences for 10
                                                 12

potential N-glycosylation sites, and several 0-glycosylation sites and one C-mannosylation
site in the TSP1 repeats.
[000701           Proteins and molecules that are large and labile such as ADAMTS 13, are
generally limited to intravenous administration due to the low bioavailability of the
formulations when administered subcutaneously. For example, previous studies report that
Factor VIII, a 170 to 300kDa protein, is typically administered intravenously because Factor
VIII formulations normally exhibit a very low bioavailability due to insufficient absorption
and severe degradation when administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intradermally.
See PCT/SE95/00348.
[000711           For example, it has been reported that Factor VIII concentrate injected
intramuscularly yielded a maximum circulating level of only 1.4% of the normal plasma level
with and without sodium citrate as an additive to used to prevent degradation and increase
absorption (Pool et al, New England J. Medicine, vol. 275, no. 10, p. 547-548, 1966). The
studies further revealed that there was no significant difference in the activity recovered in
the circulation regardless of whether such citrate was added to the preparation. In a later
study, a high-purity factor VIII was administered intramuscularly to haemophilic dogs and
human volunteers (Johnson et al, Br. J. Hematology, vol. 21, p. 21-41, 1971). Although, the
doses were much larger than used by Pool et al., neither the dogs nor the human volunteers
showed a significant rise in plasma factor VIII levels. In fact, the plasma factor VIII
concentration in the haemophilic human volunteers remained below 1% of the normal plasma
level, i.e. the severe haemophilia A prevailed even after administration in the absence of
additives increasing the bio availability.
[00072]           There has been some success at subcutaneous delivery of small proteins such
as Factor IX that do not degrade and aggregate like large, labile proteins such as Factor VIII
and ADAMTS 13. For example, subcutaneous administration of factor IX without additives
is known from Berettini et al., "Subcutaneous factor IX administration to patients with
hemophilia B," Am. J. Hematology, 47(1):61-62, 1994. However, even Factor IX, which is
only 56 kDa, exhibited poor and very slow transport into the circulation.
[00073]           Due to the low bioavailability of proteins such as Factors VIII and IX as
described above, methods of subcutaneous delivery of large and labile proteins are not
generally pursued. Rather, such proteins are normally given intravenously so that the
                                                 13

formulation is directly available in the blood stream. It would however be advantageous if a
medicament could be given subcutaneously because subcutaneous administration is a
minimally invasive mode of administration. Subcutaneous administration is also the most
versatile mode of administration that can be used for short term and long term therapies.
Subcutaneous administration can be performed by injection or by implantation of a sustained
or timed release device beneath the surface of the skin. The site of the injection or device can
be rotated when multiple injections or devices are needed.
[00074]          Accordingly, subcutaneous formulations much easier to handle for the patient,
especially since the formulation may have to be taken regularly during the whole life (e.g.,
starting as early as a child's first year of life). Furthermore, the easy and speed of
subcutaneous delivery allows increased patient compliance and quicker access to medication
when needed. Thus, there is a benefit and need for subcutaneous formulations of
ADAMTS13.
[000751          The present invention is based on the unexpected discovery of a successful
method of subcutaneously administering liquid and lyophilized formulations of purified
ADAMTS proteins.
     II.    DEFINITIONS
[00076]          Throughout this specification and the claims, unless the context requires
otherwise, the word "comprise" and its variations, such as "comprises" and "comprising,"
will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or
steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps.
[000771          As used herein, "ADAMTS13" or "ADAMTS13 " refer to a metalloprotease
of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type I motifs)
family that cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF) between residues Tyr 1605 and Met 1606.
In the context of the present invention, an "ADAMTS13 protein" embraces any ADAMTS13
protein, for example, ADAMTS13 from a mammal such as a primate, human (NP620594),
monkey, rabbit, pig, bovine (XP610784), rodent, mouse (NP001001322), rat (XP342396),
hamster, gerbil, canine, feline, frog (NP00108333 1), chicken (XP415435), and biologically
active derivatives thereof. As used herein, "ADAMTS 13 proteins" refer to recombinant and
plasma derived ADAMTS 13 proteins. Mutant and variant ADAMTS 13 proteins having
activity are also embraced, as are functional fragments and fusion proteins of the
                                                    14

ADAMTS13 proteins. Furthermore, the ADAMTS13 proteins of the invention may further
comprise tags that facilitate purification, detection, or both. The ADAMTS13 proteins
described herein may further be modified with a therapeutic moiety or a moiety suitable
imaging in vitro or in vivo.
[000781         Human ADAMTS13 proteins include, without limitation, polypeptides
comprising the amino acid sequence of GenBank accession number NP.sub.--620594 or a
processed polypeptide thereof, for example a polypeptide in which the signal peptide (amino
acids 1 to 29) and/or propeptide (amino acids 30-74) have been removed. Many natural
variants of human ADAMTS13 are known in the art, and are embraced by the formulations
of the present invention, some of which include mutations selected from R7W, V88M, H96D,
R102C, R193W, T1961, H234Q, A250V, R268P, W390C, R398H, Q448E, Q456H, P457L,
P475S, C508Y, R528G, P618A, R625H, 1673F, R692C, A732V, E740K, A900V, S903L,
C908Y, C951G, G982R, C1024G, A1033T, R1095W, R1095W, R1123C, C1213Y, T12261,
G1239V, and R1336W. Additionally, ADAMTS13 proteins include natural and recombinant
proteins that have been mutated, for example, by one or more conservative mutations at a
non-essential amino acid. Preferably, amino acids essential to the enzymatic activity of
ADAMTS 13 will not be mutated. These include, for example, residues known or presumed to
be essential for metal binding such as residues 83, 173, 224, 228, 234, 281, and 284, and
residues found in the active site of the enzyme, e.g., residue 225. Similarly, in the context of
the present invention, ADAMTS13 proteins include alternate isoforms, for example, isoforms
lacking amino acids 275 to 305 and/or 1135 to 1190 of the full-length human protein.
[000791         Likewise, ADAMTS13 proteins may be further modified, for example, by
post-translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation at one or more amino acids selected from
human residues 142, 146, 552, 579, 614, 667, 707, 828, 1235, 1354, or any other natural or
engineered modification site) or by ex vivo chemical or enzymatic modification, including
without limitation, glycosylation, modification by water soluble polymer (e.g., PEGylation,
sialylation, HESylation, etc.), tagging, and the like.
[00080]         As used herein, "blood clotting disorder" is defined as a disorder that includes
dysfunctional platelet recruitment as well as dysfunctional neutrophil recruitment. Non
limiting examples of "blood clotting disorders" include inherited thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), acquired TTP, cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction,
                                                 15

ischemic/reperfusion injury, deep vein thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC) such as sepsis-related DIC.
[00081]         As used herein, "one unit of ADAMTS13 activity" is defined as the amount of
activity in 1 ml of pooled normal human plasma, regardless of the assay being used. For
example, one unit of ADAMTS 13 FRETS-VWF73 activity is the amount of activity needed
to cleave the same amount of FRETS-VWF73 substrate (Kokame et al., Br J Haematol. 2005
April ;129(1):93-100) as is cleaved by one ml of pooled normal human plasma. Additional
activity assays can also be used to determine the activity of one unit of ADAMTS13. For
example, direct ADAMTS 13 activity assays can be performed to detect the cleavage of either
full-length VWF molecules or VWF fragments using SDS agrose gel electrophoresis and
indirect detection of ADAMTS13 activity can be detected with collagen binding assays.
[00082]         As used herein, the terms "ADAMTS13" and "biologically active derivative",
respectively, also include polypeptides obtained via recombinant DNA technology.
Alternatively, ADAMTS 13 can also refer to the plasma derived ADAMTS 13 purified from
pooled human blood. The recombinant ADAMTS13 ("rADAMTS13"), e.g. recombinant
human ADAMTS13 ("r-hu-ADAMTS 13"), may be produced by any method known in the
art. One specific example is disclosed in WO 02/42441 which is incorporated herein by
reference with respect to the method of producing recombinant ADAMTS 13. This may
include any method known in the art for (i) the production of recombinant DNA by genetic
engineering, e.g. via reverse transcription of RNA and/or amplification of DNA, (ii)
introducing recombinant DNA into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells by transfection, i.e. via
electroporation or microinjection, (iii) cultivating said transformed cells, e.g. in a continuous
or batchwise manner, (iv) expressing ADAMTS 13, e.g. constitutively or upon induction, and
(v) isolating said ADAMTS13, e.g. from the culture medium or by harvesting the
transformed cells, in order to (vi) obtain substantially purified recombinant ADAMTS 13, e.g.
via anion exchange chromatography or affinity chromatography. The term "biologically
active derivative" includes also chimeric molecules such as, e.g. ADAMTS13 (or a
biologically active derivative thereof) in combination with Ig, in order to improve the
biological/pharmacological properties such as, e.g. half life of ADAMTS13 in the circulation
system of a mammal, particularly human. The Ig could have also the site of binding to an
optionally mutated Fc receptor.
                                                 16

[000831          As used herein, the term "thrombus" refers to a blood clot, especially a
platelet-comprising blood clot, a microthrombus, and/or an embolus. Said thrombus may be
attached to an arterial or venous blood vessel or not, and may partially or completely block
the blood flow in an arterial or venous blood vessel.
[00084]          As used herein, a "therapeutically effective amount or dose" or "sufficient
amount or dose" refers to a dose that produces effects for which it is administered. The exact
dose will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in
the art using known techniques (see, e.g., Lieberman, Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms (vols. 1
3, 1992); Lloyd, The Art, Science and Technology of Pharmaceutical Compounding (1999);
Pickar, Dosage Calculations (1999); and Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy,
20th Edition, 2003, Gennaro, Ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins).
[000851          As used herein, a "physiological concentration" of salt refers to a salt
concentration of between about 100 mM and about 200 mM of a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt. Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, without limitation,
sodium and potassium chloride, sodium and potassium acetate, sodium and potassium citrate,
sodium and potassium phosphate.
[000861          As used herein, a "sub-physiological concentration" of salt refers to a salt
concentration of less than about 100 mM of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. In preferred
embodiments, a sub-physiological concentration of salt is less than about 80 mM of a
pharmaceutical salt. In another preferred embodiment, a sub-physiological concentration of
salt is less than about 60 mM of a pharmaceutical salt.
[000871          As used herein, the term "about" denotes an approximate range of plus or
minus 10% from a specified value. For instance, the language "about 20%" encompasses a
range of 18-22%. As used herein, about also includes the exact amount. Hence "about 20%"
means "about 20%" and also "20%."

                                                18

formulation may be determined by spectroscopy (i.e., total protein measured at A280) or
other bulk determination (e.g., Bradford assay, silver stain, weight of a lyophilized powder,
etc.). In other embodiments, the concentration of ADAMTS13 may be determined by an
ADAMTS13 ELISA assay (e.g., mg/mL antigen).
[00092]          In yet other embodiments, the concentration of ADAMTS13 in a formulation
provided by the present invention may be expressed as a level of enzymatic activity. For
example, in one embodiment an ADAMTS 13 formulation may contain between about 10

    IV.     METHODS OF TREATMENT
[0001031        The formulations described herein can be subcutaneously administered for
therapeutic or prophylactic treatments. Generally, for therapeutic applications, formulations
are administered to a subject with a disease or condition associated with ADAMTS 13 or
VWF dysfunction or otherwise in need thereof, in a "therapeutically effective dose."
Formulations and amounts effective for these uses will depend upon the severity of the
disease or condition and the general state of the patient's health. Single or multiple
administrations of the formulations may be administered depending on the dosage and
frequency as required and tolerated by the patient.
[000104]        A "patient" or "subject" for the purposes of the present invention includes both
humans and other animals, particularly mammals. Thus the compositions, formulations, and
methods are applicable to both human therapy and veterinary applications. In a particular
embodiment the patient is a mammal, and in one embodiment, is a human. Other known
treatments and therapies for conditions associated with ADAMTS13 or VWF dysfunction can
be used in combination with the formulations and methods provided by the invention.
[000105]        In certain embodiments, the subcutaneous ADAMTS13 formulation may be
administered by subcutaneous injection. In specific embodiments, the subcutaneous
ADAMTS13 formulation are subcutaneously injected into the same site of a patient (e.g.,
administered to the upper arm, anterior surface of the thigh, lower portion of the abdomen, or
upper back) for repeat or continuous injections. In other embodiments, the subcutaneous
ADAMTS 13 formulation are subcutaneously injected into the different or rotating sites of a
patient. In certain embodiments, the subcutaneous ADAMTS13 formulation may be
administered by subcutaneously implanted device. In certain embodiments, the implanted
device provides a timed release of an ADAMTS13 formulation. In certain embodiments, the
implanted device provides a continuous release of an ADAMTS13 formulation.
[0001061        In certain embodiments, an ADAMTS13 formulation described herein can be
used for the treatment and prophylaxis of ADAMTS13 and vWF dysfunction. In certain
embodiments, an ADAMTS 13 formulation described herein can be used for the treatment
and prophylaxis of thrombotic diseases and conditions. In certain embodiments, an
ADAMTS13 formulation described herein can be used for the treatment and prophylaxis of
an infarction.
                                                24

[0001071        In specific embodiments, an ADAMTS13 formulation described herein can be
used for the treatment and prophylaxis of inherited TTP. Inherited TTP is due to genetic
mutations of the ADAMTS13 gene. Inherited TTP can lead to neurologic manifestations
(e.g., mental status, stroke, seizures, hemiplegia, paresthesias, visual disturbance, and
aphasia), fatigue, and severe bleeding. If left untreated, acquired TTP can be fatal or can
cause lasting physiological damage. Furthermore, because inherited TTP is due to a genetic
mutation, life-long treatment is needed and patient compliance is required. While
intravenous delivery of ADAMTS13 formulations is effective at treating inherited TTP,
intravenous delivery of drugs is not easy for patients to handle (especially children with
inherited TTP) and decreases patient compliance. Accordingly, it would be beneficial to
develop a subcutaneous ADAMTS13 formulation and a method of ADAMTS13
subcutaneous delivery.
[000108]        In specific embodiments, an ADAMTS13 formulation described herein can be
used for the treatment and prophylaxis of acquired TTP. In acquired TTP, patients have a
low ADAMTS13 activity due to the development of autoimmune antibodies directed at
ADAMTS 13. Immune-complexed ADAMTS 13 is inactivated, neutralized and/or cleared
from the blood stream and patient plasma. Reduced ADAMTS 13 activity leads to the
accumulation of large uncleaved VWF multimers which can spontaneously adhere to
platelets and leading to platelet-VWF-rich thrombi in the microcirculation. Like inherited
TTP, acquired TTP can also lead to neurologic manifestations (e.g., mental status, stroke,
seizures, hemiplegia, paresthesias, visual disturbance, and aphasia), fatigue, and severe
bleeding. If left untreated, acquired TTP can be fatal or can cause lasting physiological
damage. Accordingly, patient compliance of ADAMTS13 administration is necessary to
prevent permanent damage and eventual fatalities. Thus, it would be beneficial to develop a
subcutaneous ADAMTS13 formulation and a method of ADAMTS13 subcutaneous delivery
to increase patient ease and compliance as described above.
[000109]        In specific embodiments, ADAMTS13 formulations described herein can be
used for the treatment and prophylaxis of myocardial infarction. In specific embodiments, an
ADAMTS 13 formulation described herein can also be used for the treatment and prophylaxis
of ischemic/reperfusion injury. Reperfusion is the restoration of blood supply to tissue that is
ischemic, due to decrease in blood supply. Reperfusion is a procedure for treating infarction
(e.g., myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction) or other ischemia, by enabling viable
                                                25

ischemic tissue to recover, thus limiting further necrosis. However, reperfusion can itself
further damage the ischemic tissue, causing reperfusion injury. For example, acute
myocardial infarction (AMI) is caused by thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery. In
addition to the immediate injury that occurs during deprivation of blood flow,
ischemic/reperfusion injury involves tissue injury that occurs after blood flow is restored
from the reperfusion.
[000110]        Furthermore, it has been reported that ADAMTS13 has an anti-inflammatory
effect that prevents or decreases secondary injury during ischemic reperfusion. De Meyer et
al. ("Protective anti-inflammatory effect of ADAMTS13 on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion
injury in mice," Blood, 2012, 120(26):5217-5223). As described by De Meyer et al., VWF
and ADAMTS13 are involved in platelet adhesion and thrombus formation because
ADAMTS13 cleaves the most thrombogenic VWF multimers into smaller and less
hemostatically active VWF fragments. De Meyer et al. also describe ADAMTS's role in
down-regulating inflammatory responses. It has also been shown that ADAMTS 13 can
reduce thrombosis and inflammation (e.g., atherosclerosis). Chauhan et al. ("ADAMTS 13: a
new link between thrombosis and inflammation," J Exp Med., 2008, 205:2065-2074);
Chauhan et al. ("Systemic antithrombotic effects of ADAMTS 13," J Exp Med., 2006,
203:767-776; Gandhi et al. ("ADAMTS13 reduces vascular inflammation and the
development of early atherosclerosis in mice," Blood, 2012, 119(10):2385-2391.
[000111]        De Meyer et al. suggest that ADAMTS13 prevents excessive VWF-mediated
platelet and leukocyte recruitment in the ischemic myocardium by cleaving VWF. Based on
this hypothesis, De Meyer et al. show that neutrophil infiltration in the myocardium of
animals with induced myocardial infarction was nine times lower when the animals were
treated ADAMTS 13. Accordingly, De Meyer et al. show that ADAMTS 13 reduces
inflammatory responses in ischemic myocardium. This reduced inflammation also reduces
reperfusion injury by preventing leukocyte infiltration and damage. Thus, it would be
beneficial to subcutaneously administer an ADAMTS 13 formulation to patients to avoid
inflammation that results in tissue damage during infarction (e.g., myocardial infarction and
cerebral infaction) and reperfusion because subcutaneous administration is easier and faster
to administer than intravenous compositions that are generally administered by a medical
professional.
                                                26

[0001121        In specific embodiments, ADAMTS13 formulations described herein can also
be used for the treatment and prophylaxis of cerebral infarction. Cerebral infarction,
commonly referred to as a stroke, occurs when blood flow to part of the brain is prevented.
Cerebral infarctions can occurs, for example, when a blood vessel that supplies blood to the
brain is blocked by a blood clot. A Cerebral infarction can also be the result of a blunt force
trauma and mechanical injury. This can either be caused by a clot in an artery of the brain
(thrombotic stroke) or by a clot from another part of the body that travels to the brain
(embolic stroke). Accordingly, in some embodiments, the invention provides a method of
improving the recovery of (or reducing the damage to) sensory and/or motor function in a
patient after a cerebral infarction, comprising the step of administering to the individual a
pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an
ADAMTS13 protein or a biologically active derivative thereof, thereby improving the
recovery of (or reducing the damage to) sensory and/or motor function in the individual post
cerebral infarction.
[0001131        In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is administered
immediately upon discovery of the cerebral infarction, e.g., within 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15
minutes, 20 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes, 35 minutes, 40 minutes, 45 minutes, 50
minutes, 55 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 110 minutes, 120 minutes, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5
hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours, 13 hours, 14 hours, 15
hours, 16 hours, 17 hours, 18 hours, 19 hours, 20 hours, 21 hours, 22 hours, 23 hours, 24
hours, 25 or more hours, or any combination thereof Accordingly, it is important to have a
pharmaceutical composition that can be quickly and easily administered. As with myocardial
infarction, ADAMTS13 formulations can be administered subcutaneously to reduce
inflammation caused by the infarction, thereby preventing cerebral damage, and to reduce
reperfusion injury by preventing leukocyte infiltration and damage. Furthermore,
ADAMTS 13 formulations can be administered subcutaneously to protect against secondary
injury to infarct tissue (e.g., cerebral tissue and myocardial tissue) caused by reperfusion.
[000114]        Thus, it would be beneficial to develop a subcutaneous ADAMTS13
formulation and a method of ADAMTS13 subcutaneous delivery.
[000115]        In specific embodiments, ADAMTS13 formulations described herein can be
used for the treatment and prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT is a blood clot
that forms in a vein, deep in the body. While most deep vein clots occur in the lower leg or
                                                  27

thigh, they can occur throughout the body. DVT is a particularly dangerous disease because
a blood clot can break off and travel through the bloodstream (an embolus) to the heart,
lungs, or brain, for example. Such embolisms can cause damage to organs and may result in
death. Accordingly, as described above, ADAMTS 13 formulations can be used to treat DVT
and resulting embolisms. Furthermore, because DVT can develop and cause damage quickly,
it is important to have a pharmaceutical composition that can be quickly and easily
administered. Thus, it would be beneficial to develop a subcutaneous ADAMTS 13
formulation and a method of ADAMTS 13 subcutaneous delivery.
[0001161         In specific embodiments, ADAMTS13 formulations described herein can be
used for the treatment and prophylaxis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC),
specifically, sepsis-related DIC. DIC is a condition in which blood clots form throughout the
body's small blood vessels. These blood clots can reduce or block blood flow throughout the
body and can result in damage to tissues and organs. The blood clots in the small blood
vessels results from an increase in clotting activity. This increase in activity over uses
available platelets and clotting factors, thereby also increasing the chance of serious internal
and external bleeding by depleting the available source of platelets and clotting factors.
Accordingly, a patient with DIC will often suffer from blood clots and severe bleeding
disorders.
[0001171         Certain diseases such as sepsis, surgery/trauma, cancer, complications of
childbirth/pregnancy, venomous snake bites (rattlesnakes and vipers), frostbite, and burns can
cause clotting factors to become overactive and can lead to DIC. DIC can also be acute
(developing quickly over hours or days) or chronic (developing over weeks or months).
While both types of DIC require medical treatment, acute DIC must be treated immediately
to prevent excessive blood clotting in the small blood vessels that quickly lead to severe
bleeding. Accordingly, it is important to have a pharmaceutical composition that can be
quickly and easily administered to treat DIC, especially acute DIC such as sepsis-related
DIC. Thus, it would be beneficial to develop a subcutaneous ADAMTS13 formulation and a
method of ADAMTS13 subcutaneous delivery.

     VI.     EXAMPLES
[000121]        Example 1: The Pharmacokinetic Properties of rADAMTS13 with Intravenous
and Subcutaneous Administration
[000122]        This study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of
recombinant ADAMTS13 in G6ttingen minipigs after intravenous (i.v.) or subcutaneous
(s.c.) administration. In this study, 4 male G6ttingen minipigs were administered i.v.
ADMTS13 (the "intravenous group") and 4 male G6ttingen minipigs were administered s.c.
ADMTS13 (the "subcutaneous group").
[000123]        Male G6ttingen minipigs were trained before the start of the study to
cooperate with the study procedures. Thus, the animals were not restrained during
administration of anesthetics or the test item and blood sampling.
[000124]        The animals were anesthetized for catheter implantation using a Zoletil mix
consisting of 1.11mg/kg tiletamine, 1.11mg/kg zolazepam, 0.56mg/kg xylazine, 0.56mg/kg
ketamine, and 0.11mg/kg butorphanole (i.m.). Isoflurane was used for anesthesia
maintenance when necessary. The animals received pure oxygen via a mask or an
endotracheal tube during surgery. The jugular region was shaved and disinfected. A central
catheter was inserted into the cranial V. cava using the Seldinger technique. 4mg/kg
carprofene was administered for analgesia before recovery from anesthesia.
[000125]        The intravenous group received a nominal dose of 200 FRETS-U/kg
rADAMTS13 i.v. (0.085 mL/kg). The subcutaneous group received a nominal dose of 1000
FRETS-U/kg rADAMTS13 s.c. (0.456 mL/kg). Blood was sampled via the central venous
catheter before administration of the test item and 5min, 1h, 3h, 6h, 9h. 24h, 32h, 48h, 56h
and 72h after administration of the test item. Blood samples were prepared as follows: the
first 0.5-0.7 mL were discarded to avoid dilution with the catheter lock solution (saline).
Then, 0.8 mL blood was collected and mixed with 0.2 mL sodium citrate. The blood sample
was centrifuged with 5700 rpm (1x 10min, 1x 5min). The plasma was stored at < -60'C.
[000126]        ADAMTS13 activity was determined by a FRETS assay and antigen by an
ELISA. Furthermore, the potential development of binding antibodies against human
                                                30

rADAMTS13 and the influence of rADAMTS13 on the multimer pattern of endogenous
VWF were assessed.
[000127]          As expected, after i.v. administration the median Tmax (time to Cm ax) was 5min,
indicating immediate bioavailability. Median Tmax after s.c. administration was 24h for
ADAMTS13 activity and 28h for ADAMTS13 antigen. Mean plasma concentrations of
ADAMTS 13 activity are summarized in Figure 1 and the averaged concentrations of
ADAMTS13 antigen are summarized in Figure 2.
[000128]          The dose-adjusted AUCo-tast [h*U/mL/U/kg and h*tg/mL/tg/kg] after i.v.
administration was 0.3 06 for activity and 0.3 73 for antigen. AUCo-tast was computed using
the trapezoidal rule from time point 0 to the last sampling time (tiast) (Hauschke et al. 2007).
The dose-adjusted AUCo-tast following s.c. administration was 0.198 for activity and 0.243 for
antigen. Thus, the ratio of the dose-adjusted AUCo-tiast following s.c. and i.v. administration
was 0.646 for activity and 0.651 for antigen. IVR [%] was 55.8 (activity) and 79.3 (antigen)
after i.v. administration and 13.8 (activity) and 17.3 (antigen) after s.c. administration.
[000129]          Since the plasma level of rADAMTS13 did not decline sufficiently during the
observation period, the estimation of the terminal and initial half-lives has to be viewed with
caution. Thus, the dependent parameters (MRT, Vss, Cls, AUCo-inf) may be unreliable as
well. A follow-up study will be conducted to assess these parameters. Assessment of binding
antibodies against rADAMTS 13 was negative for all samples from all animals.
[000130]          Results of the assessment of the minipigs' VWF multimer pattern were
indicative for a very limited cleavage of endogenous VWF by recombinant ADAMTS13
(Table 1). The satellite band close to a low VWF-mer slightly increased in intensity over
time in animals receiving s.c. administration, but not in animals receiving i.v. administration.
The height of the VWF multimer patterns did not change in either group.

agarose gels.

[0001311        Example 2: The Pharmacokinetic Properties of rADAMTS13 with Intravenous
and Subcutaneous Administration
[000132]        This study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of
recombinant ADAMTS13 in G6ttingen minipigs after intravenous (i.v.) or subcutaneous
(s.c.) administration. In this study, 4 male G6ttingen minipigs were administered i.v.
ADMTS13 (the "intravenous group") and 4 male G6ttingen minipigs were administered s.c.
ADMTS 13 (the "subcutaneous group").
[000133]        The male G6ttingen minipigs were acclimated to study procedures and
anesthetized for catheter implantation as described in Example 1.
[000134]        This study was a trial using 3 and 5 male G6ttingen minipigs per group. Both
groups received a nominal dose of 200 FRETS-U/kg rADAMTS 13. Three animals were
dosed i.v., the other five animals were dosed s.c.. Blood was sampled via the central venous
catheter before administration of the test item and 5min, lh, 2h, 6h, 5h, 23h, 30h, 47h, 54h,
71h, 78h, 95h and 102h after administration of the test item.
[000135]        Blood samples were prepared as follows: The first 0.5-0.7 mL were discarded
to avoid dilution with the catheter lock solution (saline). Then, 0.8 mL blood was collected
and mixed with 0.2 mL sodium citrate. The blood sample was centrifuged with 5700 rpm (lx
10min, 1x 5min). The plasma was stored at < -60 0 C.
[000136]        ADAMTS13 activity was determined by a FRETS assay and antigen by an
ELISA.
[000137]        As expected, after i.v. administration the median Tmax (time to Cmax) was 5min,
indicating immediate bioavailability. Median Tmax after s.c. administration was 30h. Mean
plasma concentrations of ADAMTS 13 activity are summarized in Figure 3 and the averaged
concentrations of ADAMTS13 antigen are summarized in Figure 4.
                                                 32

[0001381        The AUCo-tiast [U/mL/*h and pg/mL*h] after i.v. administration was 68.25 for
activity and 39.81 for antigen. The AUCo-tiast following s.c. administration was 47.16 for
activity and 26.23 for antigen. IVR [%] was 61.0 (activity) and 45.6 (antigen) after i.v.
administration and 13.0 (activity) and 9.6 (antigen) after s.c. administration.
[000139]        Terminal half-life [h] after i.v. administration was 46.96 for activity and 48.83
for antigen. Terminal half-life after s.c. administration was 56.76 for activity and 41.25 for
antigen. MRT [h] was 64.08 (activity) and 66.26 (antigen) after i.v. administration and 104.2
(activity) and 77.52 (antigen) after s.c. administration.
[000140]        In summary, the bioavailability of the s.c. administration relative to the i.v.
administration was 65.9% and 69.10%for ADAM TS13 antigen and ADAMTS13 activity,
respectively.
