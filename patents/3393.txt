PRIORITY DOCUMENTS
[0001] The present application claims priority from Australian Provisional Patent Application No.
<removed-apn> titled "CHECK VALVE IMPROVEMENTS" and filed on 13 April 2017, the content of
which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002] The present disclosure relates to a check valve for a hydraulic cylinder performing a safety
critical function. The invention is described in relation to a tipping truck or trailer, but it is not so limited
in application, with potential applications including all of those in which a hydraulic cylinder is used to
lift a load and maintain it in an elevated position.
BACKGROUND
[0003] A hoist check valve functions to lock a hydraulic cylinder (the hoist) in position, and keep the
hoist in this position even if a pressure loss event occurs. This function is safety critical in machinery such
as tipping trucks and trailers, which comprise a bed which is tilted by the hoist cylinder, as the hoist check
valve prevents uncommanded drop of a raised (tilted) bed.
[0004] During raising and lowering operations, the truck/trailer must remain stationary, but operators
wish to reduce this idle time as far as possible.
[0005] It is against this background and the problems and difficulties associated therewith that the
present invention has been developed.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0049] Referring now to Figure 1, where there is illustrated a control arrangement for a hydraulic hoist
cylinder 100 for tipping (hoisting) a bed (not illustrated) of a tipping truck or trailer.

                                                         5
[0050] Operation of the hoist cylinder 100 is controlled by a directional control valve (DCV) 110. An
input line 112 extends to the DCV 110 from a hydraulic pump (not illustrated), and a return line 114
extends from the DCV 110 to a reservoir (or tank - not illustrated) for the hydraulic fluid.
[0051] A check valve assembly 1 is installed in a fluid line 116 extending between the hoist cylinder 100
and the DCV 110. In this case, a fitting 120 connects the check valve assembly 100 to a barrel 102 of the
hoist cylinder 100.
[0052] Referring now to Figures 2 through 6, it can be seen that the check valve assembly 1 comprises a
valve body 10 and a pneumatically actuated cartridge valve 50 (although other valve types could be
employed). The cartridge valve 50 comprises a valve member 52, an actuator 54 for the valve member 52,
and a housing 56.
[0053]     Referring now to Figures 7 through 15, it can be seen that the valve body 10 comprises a block
of machined steel in this case, although it could take other forms, be manufactured by other suitable
means, and/or employ other suitable materials. This valve body 10 comprises a first fluid port 12, a
second fluid port 14, and a fluid passageway 16 extending between the first and second fluid ports 12 and
14. In this case, the ports 12 and 14 are threaded to receive connector fittings.
[0054] Being a block, the valve body 10 comprises a pair of major side faces 20 and 21, a pair of side
edge faces 22 and 23, and a pair of end faces 24 and 25.
[0055] The first fluid port 12 is located in a first of the end faces 24 of the valve body 10, and the second
fluid port 14 is located in a first of the side edge faces 22 of the valve body 10. That is to say, the first
fluid port 12 and the second fluid port 14 extend normal to each other, so that the fluid passageway 16
comprises two portions 16a and 16b extending normal to each other, and which intersect at a corner.
[0056] The valve body 10 further comprises a mount 18 for the cartridge valve. This mount 18 comprises
a threaded port for receiving a threaded portion of the housing 56 of the cartridge valve 50 therein. This
mount port 18 is located in a second of the end faces 25 of the valve body 10, and it is aligned with the
first fluid port 12.
[0057]     The first fluid port 12 adjoins a valve seat 30 for the valve member 52. The valve member
comprises a cylindrical sleeve 58 which seals against the cooperatively shaped (i.e. circular) valve seat
30. The sleeve 58 comprises a side wall 60, an end wall 62, a plurality of fluid ports 64 through the side
wall 60, and an aperture 66 through the end wall 62.

                                                        6
[0058] The valve member 52 further comprises a piston 68 which depends from the actuator, and which
slides within the sleeve 58 to open and close the fluid passageway 16 by opening and closing both the
ports 64 and the aperture 66.
[0059]    The second fluid port 14 adjoins a recess 40 in the valve body 10, which extends around the
valve member 52 so as to locally enlarge (by widening) the passageway 16. In this case, the recess 40
comprises an annulus which surrounds (encircles) the sleeve of the valve member 52. It should be
understood that the shape of the recess is not limited to an annulus, so long as it can receive fluid, and
preferably distribute this fluid around the valve member 52.
[0060] Because the recess 40 locally widens the passageway 16, an enlarged, elongated aperture 68 can
be provided between the recess 40 and the second fluid port 14, so as to maximise fluid flow
therebetween in use. In this case, the elongated aperture 68 comprises a widthwise (relative to the
widening of the passageway provided by the recess 40) extending slot 42, but may take the form of any
one of an ellipse, oval or a rectangle.
[0061] In use, to extend the hoist cylinder and raise (tilt) the bed, the piston is set to its open position
responsive to a pneumatic (in this case) signal from the DCV, and hydraulic fluid flow is directed (by the
DCV) to the first fluid port 12, through aperture 66 and ports 44, into the recess 40, through elongated
aperture 68, the second fluid port 14 and into the hoist cylinder 100.
[0062] When the hoist cylinder 100 is extended, the piston 68 is set to its closed position to prevent
uncommanded retraction of the hoist cylinder 100.
[0063] To retract the hoist cylinder 100 and lower the bed, the piston 68 is set to its open position, and
hydraulic flow is directed (by the DCV) from the hoist cylinder 100 to the second fluid port 14, through
elongated aperture 68, into the recess 40, through ports 44 and aperture 66, and out of the first fluid port
12.
[0064] By virtue of the design of check valve assembly 1, and in particular by way of it comprising the
elongated aperture 68 and recess 40, increased flows and significant pressure drops have been achieved
when compared with a presently employed check valve, which lacked these features.
[0065] In terms of a hoist cylinder 100 retraction on a tipping truck or trailer, this pressure drop
manifests itself as a significant reduction in the time taken to lower the bed, which in turn reduces truck
idle time, resulting in improved efficiencies for operators operating in an increasingly competitive market.

                                                        7
[0066] The check valve assembly 1 further comprises a pressure relief valve 70, which is screwed into a
relief valve port 72. This relief valve port 72 is positioned between the first and second fluid ports 12 and
14, and subtends an acute angle with respect to each of these. Moreover, the relief valve port 72 extends
from a chamfer 74 provided at the corner of end face 24 and side edge face 22. Directing the relief valve
port 72 at this angle, and providing chamfer 74, both have the advantageous effect of reducing the size of
the valve body 10, when compared with a presently employed check valve, which possesses neither of
these features. As a result, valve body 10 requires less steel (thereby reducing cost), and it is physically
smaller, so that it does not protrude to the same extent as the presently employed check valve, and so it is
less susceptible to damage when in use.
[0067] A further advantage of inclining the relief valve port 72 in this way, is that relief passage 76 can
be drilled via the first fluid port 12, eliminating any need for an extra access hole to be drilled in order to
drill relief passage 76, which (i.e the extra access hole) then must be plugged at extra expense.
[0068] Throughout the specification and the claims that follow, unless the context requires otherwise, the
words "comprise" and "include" and variations such as "comprising" and "including" will be understood
to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers, but not the exclusion of any other integer or
group of integers.
[0069] The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as, an
acknowledgement of any form of suggestion that such prior art forms part of the common general
knowledge.
[0070] It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention is not restricted in its use to the
particular application described. Neither is the present invention restricted in its preferred embodiment
with regard to the particular elements and/or features described or depicted herein. It will be appreciated
that the invention is not limited to the embodiment or embodiments disclosed, but is capable of numerous
rearrangements, modifications and substitutions without departing from the scope of the invention as set
