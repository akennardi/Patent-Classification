         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         P-nitrobenzene formaldehyde is an important medicine, pesticide and dye
   intermediates    in the pharmaceutical        industry are   it  is  often used    for the
10 thiosemicarbazone, trimethoprim and acetamide benzene hydrazone smoke synthesis.
   Trimethoprim is used as an antibacterial drug, which is similar to antibacterial
   spectrum and sulfa drugs, it has the role of inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, when
   combined with sulfa drugs, folic acid metabolism in bacteria can be double interrupted,
   thus, the antibacterial effect is greatly improved. Most of the existing synthesis methods
15 are using chromic anhydride and acetic anhydride as reactants, they need to react at a
   temperature below 50C and then obtained by oxidation and hydrolysis. However, this
   method requires to use chromic anhydride as a reactant, but the chromic anhydride is
   more polluting to the environment, the cost of follow-up pollution treatment is higher, it
   is not conducive to control production cost, and the reaction needs to be under 50 C in
