                Organic synthetic intermediate hexanoic acid synthesis method
         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         The present invention relates to a method for preparing a pharmaceutical
 5 intermediate which belongs to the field of organic synthesis, more particularly, relates
   to organic synthetic intermediate hexanoic acid synthesis method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         Hexanoic acid is mainly used for organic synthesis and manufacture artificial
   flavors and natural rubber and paint drier that are made from esters. By most of the
10 existing synthesis methods, 2-octanol is instilled into nitric acid, and the distillation is
   carried out under reduced pressure. And after further dehydration is made,
   158 0C(8.OkPa) fraction is collected and finally hexanoic acid is produced. By this
   synthesis method, nitric acid will be used as chemical reaction. However, the corrosion
   capacity of nitric acid is rather strong and thus the demand for the corrosion-resistance
15 capacity of the equipment is high. As a result, the equipment maintenance cost
   increases, which isn't beneficial to the decrease in production cost. What's more, when
   the 158'C fraction is collected through reduced-pressure distillation, the reaction
   energy consumption is high, which is also not beneficial to the decrease in production
   cost. And the technology of this kind of synthesis method is very complicated.
20 Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new synthesis method.

   present invention is to provide organic synthetic intermediate hexanoic acid synthesis
   method, comprises the following steps:

   the level between 60-67C within 3-4 hours, then glycerinum sodium acetate solution is
   added and reaction is made continuously for 60-90min, then the temperature is
   decreased to the level between 10-15 C, leading to solution stratification, washing is
   made through sodium nitrate for several times, washing is made through 3-hexanone
 5 and N-methyl aniline solution for several times, then re-crystallization is made in the
   pentaerythritol tetranitrate solution, finally, dehydration is carried out by virtue of
   dehydrating agent and finished hexanoic acid is produced.

                          NH2
         CH 3(CH 2)4CHCH 2 +       Pr6 0ii    +     C9H14O              o-        CH 3 (CH 2)4 COOH
15                    Br
         Compared with the synthesis method disclosed in the background art, the
   invention provides organic synthesis intermediate hexanoic acid synthesis method, it is
   unnecessary to use nitric acid, avoiding the strong corrosion of nitric acid to the
   equipment, reducing equipment maintenance costs, not using vacuum distillation to
20 collect   158 0C    fractions, reducing the reaction energy consumption, reducing
   production costs, reducing intermediate links reaction, decreasing the reaction time and
   improving the reaction yield, at the same time, the present invention provides a new
