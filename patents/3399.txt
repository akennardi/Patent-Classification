   PRESENT SUBJECT MATTER
             The present subject matter relates to a ternary herbicidal mixture for controlling
    undesired vegetation.
10  BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT SUBJECT MATTER
             The control of undesired vegetation is extremely important in order to achieve
    high crop efficiency. In many cases, while herbicides have an effect against a spectrum
    of weeds, they do not however fight a certain type of other weeds, which is also present
    in the crop cultures to be protected. Therefore, there is a strong need for mixing two or
15  more herbicides.
             Mixtures of selected herbicides have several advantages over the use of a single
    herbicide including (a) an increase in the spectrum of weeds controlled or an extension
    of weed control over a longer period of time, (b) an improvement in crop safety by
    using minimum doses of selected herbicides applied in combination rather than a single
20  high dose of one herbicide, and (c) a delay in the appearance of resistant weed species
    to selected herbicides (Int. J. Agri. Biol., Vol. 6, No. 1, 2004, pages 209-212).
             However, the activity and selectivity behavior of any specific mixture is difficult
    to predict since the behavior of each single herbicide in the mixture is often affected by
    the presence of the other(s) and the activity of the mixture may also vary considerably
25  depending on chemical character, plant species, growth stage, and environmental
    conditions. Mostly, this practice results in reduced activity of the herbicides in the
    mixture.
             Diflufenican was first described by M. C. C. Ramp et al. (Proc. Br. Crop Prot.
    Conf - Weeds, 1985, 1, 23).

   technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly
   understood by one of skill in the art to which this subject matter pertains.
            As used herein, the phrase "agriculturally acceptable carrier" means carriers
25 which are known and accepted in the art for the formation of formulations for
   agricultural or horticultural use.
            As used herein, the term "crop" includes reference to a whole plant, plant organ
   (e.g., leaves, stems, twigs, roots, trunks, limbs, shoots, fruits etc.), plant cells, or plant
   seeds.

          In another embodiment, the present subject matter provides a kit comprising the
15 herbicidal mixture as described herein, or components thereof. Such kits may
   comprise, in addition to the aforementioned active components, one or more additional
   active and/or inactive ingredients, either within the provided herbicidal composition or
   separately.   Certain kits    comprise   an Auxin type herbicide,       bromoxynil and
   diflufenican, or an esters or salt of any of the foregoing, and/or a combination thereof,
20 each in a separate container, and each optionally combined with a carrier.
          In an embodiment, the kit comprises fluroxypyr meptyl, bromoxynil octanoate,
   and diflufenican. In another embodiment, the kit comprises MCPA, bromoxynil
   octanoate, and diflufenican.
          A synergistic effect exists wherever the action of a combination of active
25 components is greater than the sum of the action of each of the components alone.
   Therefore, a synergistically effective amount (or an effective amount of a synergistic
   composition or combination) as discussed herein is an amount that exhibits greater
   pesticidal activity than the sum of the pesticidal activities of the individual
   components.
30        In the context of the present subject matter, the term "synergy" is as defined by
   Colby S. R. in an article entitled "Calculation of the synergistic and antagonistic
   responses of herbicide combinations" published in the journal Weeds, 1967, 15, p. 20-

    WO 2015/019355                                                        PCT/IL2014/050713
                                                12
    22, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The action expected for a given
    combination of three active components can be calculated as follows:
                                              XY+XZ+YZ            XYZ
                                    +Y+             100          10000
 5 in which E represents the expected percentage of pesticidal control for the combination
   of the three pesticides at defined doses (for example equal to x, y and z respectively), X
   is the percentage of herbicidal control observed by fluroxypyr meptyl at a defined dose
   (equal to x), Y is the percentage of herbicidal control observed by bromoxynil octanoate
   at a defined dose (equal to y), and Z is the percentage of herbicidal control of
10 diflufenican at a defined dose (equal to z). When the percentage of herbicidal control
   observed for the combination is greater than the expected percentage, there is a
   synergistic effect. When the percentage of control observed for the combination is equal
   to the expected percentage, there is an additive effect and wherein the percentage of
   herbicidal control observed for the combination is lower than the expected percentage,
15 there is an antagonistic effect.
   EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
           The experiments were conducted by tank mixing bromoxynil octanoate, 225 g/L
    EC    (commercially     available   Bromotril®), fluroxypyr     meptyl,   200   g/L    EC
20  (commercially available Tomahawk@) and diflufenican, 500 g/L SC (commercially
    available Hurricane@) in different application rates.
           Weed seeds were sown in 0.3 L pots containing Medium-heavy clay-loam soil
    from Newe Ya'ar Research Center fields (55% clay, 23% silt, 20% sand, 2% organic
    matter, pH 7.1).
25         The experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design. Each
    treatment was replicated 5 times. The herbicides were applied with a motorized sprayer
    equipped with a Tee Jet 8001E nozzle (Spraying Systems Co., North Ave., Wheaton,
    IL. 60188, USA) and operated at a pressure of 300 kPa. The pots were transferred to a
    net house 24 hours after the herbicide application and were sprinkler irrigated to field
30  capacity of the soil. The plants were grown in the net house during the entire

                damage to the weeds. Application of fluroxypyr 200 EC alone at a rate of 250 mL ha-1
                caused an initial intermediate damage but the plants recovered almost completely at the

   WO 2015/019355                                                           PCT/IL2014/050713
                                               17
   end of the experiment. An administration rate of 500 mL ha-1 had a similar effect but
   the plants had a lower recovery. Administration of diflufenican 500 SC alone at all
   rates had a pronounced herbicidal effect. However, the combination of all three
   components together at the rates of 675 + 100 + 250 mL ha-1 was highly effective and
 5 at the higher rates of 675 + 100 + 500, 675 + 150 + 250, and 675 + 150 + 500 mL ha-1
   controlled the weed completely.
          As can be seen from the calculated herbicide test results (Colby Ratio o/e) in
   Tables 2 and 3, the ternary mixture provided a greater herbicide effect than expected
   from their individual effects on Chenopodiui album and Ainaranthus retroflexus. The
10 synergistic effect occurred over a range of bromoxynil application rates, diflufenican
   applications rates and fluroxypyr application rates.
